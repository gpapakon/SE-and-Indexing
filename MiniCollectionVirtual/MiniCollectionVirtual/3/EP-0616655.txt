Set of structural elements for erecting retaining 
walls, in particular gravity retaining walls (25), from 

a plurality of concrete blocks (10, 10a, 10b, 10c, 34) 
located one above the other and one beside the other, 

adjacent blocks being at least partially secured, by 
coupling pieces (21), against displacements relative to 

one another and, for this purpose, the blocks having a 
groove or depression (16) which runs all the way around 

the blocks, or at least having grooves or depressions 
(16) which run along on mutually opposite, upper and 

lower side surfaces (14, 15) and extend in each case in 
the plane of the wall, and blocks arranged one above the 

other and/or one beside the other being connectable by 
means of the separate coupling pieces (21) which are 

inserted into the depressions (16) of adjacent blocks, 
and can be displaced therein, characterized in that, with 

respect to a parting plane between two blocks (10, etc.), 
the coupling pieces (21) are designed differently, with 

a first anchoring piece which is positioned in a depression 
(16) of one block, can rotate in the depression (16) 

and, for this purpose, has a corresponding cross-sectional 
configuration, with the result that it is also 

possible for the two blocks which are connected to one 
another by the coupling piece (21) to rotate with respect 

to one another, and with a second anchoring piece which 
is positioned in a depression (16) of an adjacent block, 

is elongate in the direction of the depression and, 
correspondingly, cannot rotate, but can be displaced, in 

the depression.  
 
Set of structural elements according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the first, rotatable anchoring 

piece is designed in the form of a truncated cone and the 
second, non-rotatable anchoring piece is designed with a 

trapezoidal cross-section. 
Set of structural elements according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that the first, rotatable anchoring 

piece is designed with a continuous outer surface and 
the other anchoring piece is designed as a hollow body 

with, in particular, intersecting ribs or webs (23a, 23b, 
23d). 
Set of structural elements according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the anchoring piece designed as a 

hollow body is designed such that it is elongate with two 
mutually parallel longitudinal ribs (23a) in the direction 

parallel to the associated depression (16), and has 
trapezoidal transverse ribs (23b) which, in particular, 

intersect said longitudinal ribs. 
Set of structural elements according to one of 
Clams 1 to 4, characterized in that the depressions (16) 

are arranged approximately centrally or at a 2/3 distance 
away from the front side (11) and a 1/3 distance away 

from the rear side (18) of the blocks (10, etc.). 
Set of structural elements according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the coupling pieces 

(21) consist of a mouldable, hardened material, in 
particular of, or using, plastic. 
Set of structural elements according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized by anchoring members (27) 

for fixing the finished retaining wall (25) in the 
adjacent earth or embankment (26) by means of tension 

members connected to the anchoring members (27). 
Set of structural elements according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that for receiving anchoring members 

(27) the blocks (10, etc.) have, on one side (18), 
a cutout (19) which extends at least over a part-region 

of the side and has undercuts (20). 
Set of structural elements according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the cutouts are designed as continuous  

 
grooves (19), in particular with a hammer-head 

profile or dovetail profile. 
Set of structural elements according to one of 
Claims 7 to 9, characterized in that the anchoring 

members (27) are designed as hammer-head bolts. 
Set of structural elements according to one of 
Claims 7 to 10, characterized in that the tension members 

connected to the anchoring members (27) are designed as 
grid systems (29) to be laid in the earth. 
Retaining wall, in particular gravity retaining 
wall (25), produced from a set of structural elements 

according to one of Claims 1 to 11, a plurality of 
concrete blocks (10, etc.) being located one above the 

other and one beside the other, and adjacent blocks 
located one above the other being at least partially 

secured, by the coupling pieces (21) located therebetween, 
against displacements, and the coupling pieces 

(21) being inserted into the groove or into the depressions 
(16) of the mutually opposite, upper and lower side 

surfaces (14, 15). 
Retaining wall according to Claim 12, characterized 
in that the coupling pieces (21) are arranged 

centrally in the depressions (16) or such that they are 
laterally adjacent to the borders of the blocks (10, 

etc.). 
Retaining wall according to Claim 12 or 13, 
characterized in that, on arranging the blocks (10, etc.) 

in a row in an arcuate progression, thus forming wide-open 
gaps (24) between the blocks, there are assigned to 

each block, in conjunction with a block of the adjacent 
row, two coupling pieces (21) which are each inserted 

such that they are laterally adjacent to the borders of 
the blocks. 
Coupling piece for connecting blocks having 
depressions, in particular for use in a set of structural 

elements or a retaining wall according to one of Claims 1 
to 14, having two halves or anchoring pieces which are 

provided for insertion into depressions (16) of adjacent 
blocks (10, etc.), these halves having different  

 
cross-sections, characterized in that the different 

cross-sections are such that one anchoring piece of the 
coupling piece (21) can rotate in a depression and, for 

this purpose, is designed in the form of truncated cone, 
while, in another depression (16), the other anchoring 

piece can only be displaced and, for this purpose, is 
designed as a bar (22) with trapezoidal profile. 
Coupling piece according to Claim 15, characterized

body is designed such that it is elongate in the direction 
parallel to the associated depression, in particular 

with two mutually parallel longitudinal ribs (23a) and 
trapezoidal transverse ribs (23b) which intersect said 

longitudinal ribs.
