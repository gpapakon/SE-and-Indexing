<ABSTRACT>
A CCD type solid state imaging device including a 
plurality of vertically arranged light receiving elements, a 

plurality of vertical charge transfer electrodes associated 
with the light receiving elements and transfer channels 

through which signal electrical charges stored in the light 
receiving elements are readout and transferred in the charge 

transfer direction by the transfer electrodes. The present 
invention features that unlike the conventional CCD type 

solid state imaging device, the boundary line between at 
least a part of the vertical charge transfer electrodes and 

a part of the vertical charge transfer electrodes adjacent 

thereto is held aslant with respect to the transfer channels 
so that the vertical transfer efficiency of the device is 

increased without incurring a reduction in the amount of 
signal charges being handled and the readout of the signal 

charges stored in the light receiving elements to the 
transfer channels is performed more smoothly than the 

conventional device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a CCD type solid state
imaging device and more particularly, to a novel CCD type
solid state imaging device which is capable of improving the
vertical charge transfer efficiency and the efficiency of
reading out signal charges from the light receiving elements
to the transfer channels.The conventional CCD type solid state imaging device
has vertical charge transfer electrodes arranged such that
the orientation of the boundary lines among multilayer
vertical charge transfer electrodes lying over the transfer
channels is normal to the charge transfer direction. In other
words, the vertical transfer electrodes of the CCD imaging
device represent, as a whole, a shape which would be formed
by a plurality of rectangles if they were shifted parallelly
so as to partially overlap one another with the horizontal
sides of each of the vertical charge electrodes running
normal to the transfer direction as will be described in
detail later.However, in view of the fact that it is considered
necessary for a CCD type solid state imaging device to have 
a higher charge transfer efficiency, an attempt has been made to improve the
charge transfer efficiency in such a manner that a shallow barrier of an oblique
pattern is formed by selectively implanting impurities in the transfer channels
thereby meeting such demand but this method is not desirable since it reduces
the amount of electrical charges being handled, in proportion to the area of the
barrier.Prior art document PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, Vol. 14, No. 414 (E-975),
Sept. 1990, & JP-A-2 159 063 discloses a solid-state image-sensing device,
wherein the boundary of transfer electrodes is inclined in the direction of
transfer so that a region where a potential difference occurs when a voltage is
applied to the transfer electrode becomes longer than before.Further, prior art document EP-A-0 097 837 describes a charge transfer device,
wherein a plurality of electrodes is arranged along a charge transfer direction.
Each of these electrodes has a shape in plan view which is intended or concave
in the charge transfer direction for producing a potential well in the
semiconductor region.It is an object of the invention to provide a CCD type solid-state imaging device
which is capable of improving the vertical charge transfer efficiency without
reducing the amount of signal charges being handled and which enables the
signal readout from the light receiving elements to the transfer channels to be
performed smoothly. To solve this object, the
