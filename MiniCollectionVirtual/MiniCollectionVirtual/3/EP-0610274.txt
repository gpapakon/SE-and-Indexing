<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spacer 
elements for insulated glass assemblies having a 
single as well as a divided atmosphere therebetween. The prior art provides a complete plethora of 
insulated glass assemblies, sealant strips and 
spacer elements and improvements thereto used in 
insulated glass assemblies. The modifications and improvements to the 
strips etc. have all had a common goal, namely, to 
improve the insulation capacity for such assemblies 
without sacrificing structural integrity or moisture 
degradation of the assembly. Although the art is replete with such 
assemblies, it fails to provide an insulating 
sealant strip which provides: 
I) warm edge technology; II) non-ultraviolet degradable material; or III) elastic deformation between the glass 
lites. Typical of the art in the field of the present 
invention includes U.S. 4,576,841. This patent 
discloses the use of an aluminum foil into which is 
positioned desiccant material. Such an arrangement 
has two inherent limitations, namely: 
i) aluminum is a thermal conductor which 
results in thermal transmission and thus obvious 
energy expenditures and  
 ii) since the tube is solid, elastic recovery from the 
compression of glass lites engaged with the same is negligible. Further, U.S. 4,113,905 discloses a composite foam spacer 
comprising an extruded tubular profile having an outer coating 
of foam material thereon. The spacer further includes projecting 
edges which project laterally relative to the longitudinal axis 
of the spacer. Although a useful arrangement, the spacer does 
not facilitate compression dampening and, if the spacer were 
compressed, this would result in unnatural force dispersion due 
to the projecting edges which may lead to breakage of the 
substrates. Further, if compressed, the spacer element may 
disrupt sealant material associated therewith thus leading to an 
ineffective seal. Mucaria, in U.S. Patent No. 4,368,226 provides a glass 
assembly in which there is included aluminum spacers. As such, 
the arrangement is limited similar to U.S. 4,576,841 as discussed 
herein previously. Further prior art in the field of the present invention 
includes United States Patent Nos. 4,536,424; 4,822,649; 
4,952,430; 4,476,169; 4,500,572; and Canadian Patent Nos. 
884,186; 861,839; and 1,008,307. Further still, Haven, in U.S. Patent No. 2,597,097 teaches 
a multiple glazing unit incorporating a square tube metal spacer 
for spacing glass sheets. The square tube spacer is composed of 
a plurality of metal members
