<ABSTRACT>
A composite material for protecting one or more anode 
hanger nipples against oxidation and corrosion during 

operation in a Hall-Heroult electrolysis cell, 
consisting of a base material in the form of a particle 

aggregate of waste products from anodes consumed in 
aluminum electrolysis cells, calcium aluminate cement, 

a catalyst and water. Substances hazardous to health, 
such as PAH, have been removed. The composite material 

is characterised in that the particle aggregate can 
consist of particles between 1 and 2000 µm and make up 

at least 80 % of the composite material, the cement up 
to 15 %, the catalyst 0.6 % and the added water 

approximately 28 % of the solid mass.
 

The composite material is compressed under pressure to 
form a collar around the anode hanger nipples and can 

be prefabricated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a composite material for 
protecting one or more anode hanger nipples (hereinafter called 
nipples) against oxidation and corrosion during operation in a 
Hall-Heroult aluminium electrolysis cell, consisting of a 
particle aggregate of waste products from anodes consumed in 
aluminium electrolysis, calcium aluminate cement, a catalyst and 
water. Ready-processed and mounted, the composite material forms 
a protective collar around the nipple.
 
There are two main different types of composite materials which 
are used in this context:
 
For many years it has been normal practice to use petroleum coke 
and/or waste from consumed anodes as the base material and pitch 
as the binder for the first type of material for protecting anode 
hanger nipples against oxidation and corrosion during operation 
in an electrolysis cell. The disadvantages of this solution are 
that the pitch contains elements which are hazardous to health, 
for example PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) which are released 
through the high temperature in the electrolysis cell, and that 
the nipples' resistance to aggressive gases is relatively low 
because the collar covers the whole of the nipple only for part 
of the operating time before it is partly dissolved on account of 
too weak particle binding and dilation forces which arise between 
the collar and the nipple. A combination of the components petroleum coke, graphite, semi-graphite 
and waste electrode material is used as the base 
material of the second type, as well as a special cement mixture 
as the binder and water to trigger the hardening process and to 
obtain a suitable consistency for the composite material.
 
The disadvantages of this type of composite materials is that the 
base material not only consists of waste products from carbon and 
electrolysis processes but also uses raw materials such as 
petroleum coke, graphite and semi-graphite, each of which is an 
element which makes the production of the composite material more 
expensive.  EP application no. 269534 describes a coating of the latter type 
to achieve a composite material with a view to protecting the 
nipple against oxidation and corrosion. On the basis of the facts 
of the application, the assumed new features seem to be that 0.01 
to 5 % antioxidant is added to the composite aggregate in the 
form of a passivated aluminium powder with particle size less 
than 0.1 mm and that the calcium aluminate cement should not 
contain more than 2 % contaminated elements.
