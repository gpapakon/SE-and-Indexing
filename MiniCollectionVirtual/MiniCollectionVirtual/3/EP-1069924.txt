<ABSTRACT>
A catheter and introducer needle assembly (30) with needle shield (40) is provided wherein the needle (31) includes an enlarged diameter portion (38) and a distally facing shoulder (37). The needle shield (40) includes a means (60) for engaging the distally facing shoulder (37) to prevent unwanted distal movement of the needle (31) once the needle (31) has been withdrawn into the needle shield (40). The needle shield (40) also includes a small diameter opening adjacent to its proximal portion (43) to limit proximal movement of the needle (31) out of the needle shield (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to a catheter and introducer needle
assembly that includes a needle shield that will safely shield the sharp distal tip
of the introducer needle after the needle has been used to insert the catheter into
a patient.Catheters, particularly intravenous (IV) catheters, are used for infusing
fluid, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments and total parenteral
nutrition, into a patient or withdrawing blood from a patient. Peripheral IV
catheters tend to be relatively short, and are on the order of about one and one-half
inches (3.81 centimeters) in length. The most common type of IV catheter is an over the needle
peripheral IV catheter. As its name implies, an over the needle catheter is
mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. The catheter and
the introducer needle are assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle
extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing
up away from the patient's skin.The catheter and introducer needle assembly is inserted at a shallow
angle through the patient's skin into a peripheral blood vessel, i.e a smaller blood
vessel that is not connected directly to the heart but is one of the branches of the
central blood vessels that is directly connected to the heart. In order to verify
proper placement of the assembly in the blood vessel, the clinician confirms that
there is flashback of blood in the needle and in a flashback chamber located at
the proximal end of the needle which is typically formed as part of the needle
hub. Once proper placement is confirmed, the clinician applies pressure to the
blood vessel by pressing down on the patient's skin over the distal tip of the
introducer needle and the catheter. This finger pressure occludes further blood
flow through the introducer needle. The clinician withdraws the introducer
needle, leaving the catheter in place, and attaches a fluid handling device to the 
catheter hub. Once the introducer needle is withdrawn from the catheter, it is a
"blood contaminated sharp" and must be properly handled.In recent years, there has been great concern over the contamination of
clinicians with a patient's blood and a recognition that "blood contaminated
sharps" must be immediately disposed. This concern has arisen because of the
advent of currently incurable and fatal diseases, such as Acquired
Immunosuppressive Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS"), which can be transmitted by
the exchange of body fluids from an infected person to another person.

<CLAIMS>
A catheter and introducer needle assembly, comprising:

a catheter (21) having a proximal end and distal end;
a catheter hub (24) in fluid communication with the catheter (21) and having
a proximal end and a distal end connected to the proximal end of the catheter (21);
an introducer needle (31) disposed in the catheter (21) and having a
proximal end and a distal end and defining an enlarged diameter portion (38);
a needle shield (40) having a proximal end and a distal end removably
connected to the catheter hub (24), the needle shield (40) defining a longitudinally

extending passageway therethrough with the introducer needle (31) extending
through the longitudinally extending passageway wherein the longitudinally

extending passageway has a means (43,49) for engaging the enlarged diameter portion (38)
of the introducer needle (31) to prevent unwanted proximal movement of the

introducer needle (31) 
characterized in that
 the enlarged diameter portion (38) has a distally facing shoulder (37) and wherein the needle shield (40) includes a means (50,60,70) for engaging

the distally facing shoulder (37) to prevent unwanted distal movement of the
introducer needle (31).
The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 1 wherein
the means for engaging the enlarged diameter portion (38) of the introducer needle (31) to

prevent unwanted proximal movement of the introducer needle (31) is an opening into
a proximal portion (43) of the longitudinally extending passageway that has a

diameter smaller than the diameter of the enlarged diameter portion (38) of the
introducer needle (31).
The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 2 wherein
the means for engaging the distally facing shoulder (37) to prevent unwanted distal

movement of the introducer needle (31) is a latch (50) that is slidable along the introducer
needle (31) so as to be proximal of the enlarged diameter portion (38) when the distal end

of the introducer needle (31) is distal of the distal end of the needle shield (40) and distal 
of the enlarged diameter portion (38) to allow the latch (50) to engage the distally facing

shoulder (37) after the distal end of the introducer needle (31) is withdrawn into the needle
shield (40).
The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 3 wherein
the latch (50) has a generally U shaped gate and a biasing mechanism (55) to bias the U

shaped gate (50) toward the introducer needle (31).
The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 3 wherein
the latch is a tube (70) defining at least one inwardly directed tab (71).
The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 3 wherein
the latch is a leaf spring (60) having one leg (64) biased toward the introducer needle (31) for

engagement with the distally facing shoulder (37).
The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 6 wherein
the leg (64) is contoured along its proximal portion to approximate a portion of the

circumference of the introducer needle (31).
