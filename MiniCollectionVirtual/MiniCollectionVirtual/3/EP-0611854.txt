<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a composite glass panel for wall and building claddings, having at least one thicker glass pane (2, 2') and at least one thinner metal sheet (3), which are connected to one another via an adhesive layer (4), the metal sheet (3) and the glass pane (2, 2') preferably having approximately the same coefficients of expansion and the composite glass arrangement being retained, on a retaining structure (6), on the wall of the building. For a visually pleasing design and secure wall fastening, along with cost-effective producibility, it is proposed that at least one edge of the metal sheet (3) be freely accessible from the flat side of the composite glass panel (1), and that fastening means (5), such as stay bolts, screws consisting of metal be fastened on said edge after the connection of the glass pane (2 and/or 2') to the metal sheet (3).

<CLAIMS>
A laminated glass panel for wall and building facings having at least one relatively 
thick glass pane (2, 2') and at least one relatively thin metal sheet (3) which are 

joined together by means of a plastic adhesive layer (4), the metal sheet (3) and the 
glass pane (2, 2') preferably having approximately the same expansion coefficients, 

the panel being supported on a supporting structure or window structure (6) in the 
wall of the building, at least one edge of the metal sheet (3) being freely accessible 

from the flat face of the panel (1), 
characterised in that
 securing means (5) such as 
stud bolts or screws of metal are fixed to the said one edge by welding after the 

glass pane (2 or 2' respectively) has been joined to the metal sheet (3). 
A laminated panel as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the plastic adhesive 
layer is comprised of at least one film. 
A laminated panel as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the film is comprised 
of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or polyur
ethane (PU). 
A laminated panel as claimed in either of Claims 2 or 3, characterised in that one 
film layer has a thickness of approximately 0.4 millimetres. 
A laminated panel as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that at least 
that side of the metal sheet (3) which is directed towards the glass pane (2 or 2'  

 
respectively) has a uniform surface, which preferably is polished and acts as mirror 

through the glass pane (2 or 2' respectively). 
A laminated panel as claimed in any of Claims I to 4, characterised in that two 
metal sheets (3,3') or sheet-metal strips (3,3') are adhered to one glass pane (Fig. 4). 
A laminated panel as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that it is 
designed as parapet pane, having a thick glass pane (2) and an equally sized metal 

sheet (3), and in that securing means (5) are provided near the edge of the metal 
sheet (3) (Fig. 1). 
A laminated panel as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that it 
comprises at least two glass panes (2, 2') with a distance frame (9) and in that a 

strip-shaped metal sheet (3) is adhered to the outer glass pane (2') on at least two 
edge sides, the securing means (5) then being welded onto the metal sheet (3). 
A laminated panel as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that one of 
the glass panes (2) has a projecting edge and in that the strip-shaped metal sheet (3) 

is provided on at least one inside edge thereof. 
A method for the fabrication of a laminated panel as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
8, characterised in that the thin metal sheet (3) is adhered to one side of the glass 

pane (2 or 2' respectively) under heat and pressure, by means of a film, e.g. an  
 

adhesive layer (4), preferably by rolling and using an autoclave process and in that 
securing means are then welded to the thin metal sheet (3) at the places provided, 

preferably by resistance welding, the period of current application, the current 
intensity, the distribution of the current intensity over time and the magnitude and 

period of the compressive load on the securing means (5) being determined by 
preliminary tests.
