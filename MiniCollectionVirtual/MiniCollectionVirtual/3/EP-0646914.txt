<ABSTRACT>
There is realized a cassette (41a,41b) with a memory 
(MIC) in which the writing time is short, it can be 

accessed in a short time, and there is no need to provide 
an apparatus side of a main body with an additional memory. 

The memory (MIC) comprises an EEPROM (SPACE 0) to store 
fundamental data such as table of contents (TOC) 

information or the like, and a large capacity memory (SPACE 
1), for example, flash memory, to store data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus in which
information relating to a recording medium in a cassette is
obtained from the cassette.A digital video cassette recorder (VCR) for digitizing
video data and recording onto a magnetic tape is being
developed. Since a transmission band of digital video data
is very wide, the digital video data is subjected to, for
example, a DCT transformation or the like and, after that,
it is recorded onto a magnetic tape.A digital VCR into which a cassette package having a
memory or the like therein can be loaded has also been
proposed. There has been proposed a digital VCR such that
by loading such a cassette package, a signal can be input
or output into/from the digital VCR and a representative
still image of a program recorded on a cassette tape, a
tape address from which the program starts, table of
contents (TOC) information, and the like are stored into
the memory, thereby simplifying the accessing operation and
realizing a high processing speed.US Patents Nos. US-A-4 338 644 and US-A-4 383 285
disclose an arrangement in which a memory loaded in a
recording medium cassette of a VCR stores recording data, 
and Japanese Patent Application No. H04-217503 and
corresponding European Patent Application Publication
No. EP-A-0 580 434 disclose such a recording medium
cassette. Each of the above applications is owned by the
present applicants and is hereby incorporated herein by
reference.In addition to the cassette with the memory as
mentioned above, there is a cassette without a memory.
There is also a digital VCR which does not correspond to
the cassette with the memory but can correspond only to the
cassette without a memory. When a cassette with a memory
is loaded into such a digital VCR that is used only for the
cassette without a memory, there is a demand that
information (tape length, tape thickness, kind of tape,
tape grade, etc.) about the cassette itself can be read out
by any apparatus from a viewpoint of the problem of
compatibility.When the above-mentioned cassette is loaded into the
digital VCR, it is impossible to ascertain information
regarding whether the cassette loaded is a new cassette or
an old cassette used before or the like. In the case where
the cassette with a memory is not properly loaded in the
digital VCR, correct communication cannot be performed
between the cassette and the VCR.When the above-mentioned memory is constructed by, for
example, only an EEPROM or the like, it needs a long 
writing time. When the memory is constructed by,

A cassette information determining method in which information relating to
a recording medium of a cassette is obtained from the cassette, comprising:


a discriminating terminal (65,54) is engaged with a terminal (64) of a cassette
(61) provided with a memory (63) containing digital basic cassette data (BCID)

indicative of which of a plurality of types of recording device the cassette is intended
to be used in, or a terminal (53) of a cassette (51) provided with an identification

element (52) having such terminal (53) so connected as to be indicative of which of
the plurality of types of recording device the cassette is intended to be used in; and
a voltage level of the discriminating terminal (65,54) after such engagement
is detected (59,70) and, in response thereto, a judgement is made from the detected

digital basic cassette data (BCID), if the discriminating terminal (65) is engaged with
the terminal (64) of the cassette (61) provided with the memory (63), or from the

detected voltage level, if the discriminating terminal (54) is engaged with the terminal

(63) of the cassette (51) provided with the identification element (52), as to which of
the plurality of types of recording device the cassette is intended to be used in.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said judgement made from the
detected digital basic cassette data (BCID) or from the detected voltage level is as to

whether the cassette is intended to be used in a digital video cassette recorder or a
tape streamer.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said judgement made from the 
detected digital basic cassette data (BCID) or from the detected voltage level is as to

whether the cassette is intended to be used in a digital video cassette recorder for
business use, a digital video cassette recorder for industrial use or a tape streamer.
A cassette information determining apparatus operative to obtain information
relating to a recording medium of a cassette from the cassette, comprising:


a discriminating terminal (65,54) to be engaged wit a terminal (64) of a
cassette (61) provided with a memory (63) containing digital basic cassette data

(BCID) indicative of which of a plurality of types of recording device the cassette is
intended to be used in, or a terminal (53) of a cassette (51) provided with an

identification element (52) having such terminal (53) so connected as to be indicative
of which of the plurality of types of recording device the cassette is intended to be

used in;
voltage level detecting means (59, 70) for detecting the voltage level of the
discriminating terminal (65,54) after such engagement; and
a controller (10) for making a judgement from the detected digital basic
cassette data (BCID), if the discriminating terminal (65) is engaged with the terminal

(64) of the cassette (61) provided with the memory (63), or from the detected voltage
level, if the discriminating terminal (54) is engaged with the terminal (63) of the

cassette (51) provided with the identification element (52), as to which of the plurality
of types of recording device the cassette is intended to be used in.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the controller (10) is so operative
that said judgement it makes from the detected digital basic cassette data (BCID) or 

from the detected voltage level is as to whether the cassette is intended to be used in
a digital video cassette recorder or a tape streamer.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the controller (10) is so operative
that said judgement it makes from the detected digital basic cassette data (BCID) or

from the detected voltage level is as to whether the cassette is intended to be used in
