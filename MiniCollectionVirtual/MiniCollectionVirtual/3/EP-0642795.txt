<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a therapeutic
medicine for cystic fibrosis.In the white population, an inherited gene-defective
disease known as cystic fibrosis is encountered
with a frequency of 1/1000-2000. This disease is caused
by the defect of a gene coding for cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and in
the event of bacterial infection to the respiratory organ
with mucoid forms of Pseudomonasaeruginosa,. Mucous
substances collect in the lungs to cause an obstruction
of airways leading to premature death. Though
antibiotics and digestive enzymes are currently in use
for the treatment of this disease, adequate therapeutic
responses remain to be achieved as yet.Recently (Richard C. Hubbard, et al.) have
reported that symptomatic improvements in cystic fibrosis
may be expected if the DNA contained in said mucus is
lysed with a DNase [The New England Journal of Medicine
326, 812-815, 1992]. However, the DNase is little
capable of lysing the mucus produced by bacteria of the
genus Pseudomonas so that no sufficient efficacy can be 
expected.Meanwhile, it is not deniable that the action
of antibiotics and digestive enzymes on Pseudomonas
aeruginosa is compromised by the alginate which these
microorganisms themselves produce.The inventors of this invention did a great
deal of research to develop a therapeutically effective
drug for cystic fibrosis. In the course of their
exploration, the inventors discovered that the mucous
substance secreted by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
isolated from the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis
contained not only DNA but also alginate in an amount
several-fold as great as the amount of DNA. Inspired by
the thought that should this alginate be somehow decomposed
the morbidity of cystic fibrosis could be cured,
the inventors did further research and have found that a
certain alginate lyase is effective for the treatment of
cystic fibrosis.In accordance with this invention a therapeutic medicine
for cystic fibrosis is provided which comprises an
alginate lyase capable of lysing the mucous substance produced
in a patient with cystic fibrosis as an active ingredient.
Embodiments of the therapeutic medicine are claimed
in the subclaims. In accordance with this invention there is further provided
the use of an alginate lyase as claimed for the manufacture
of a medicament in a form for direct application to
the affected site by spraying or coating for the treatment
of cystic fibrosis.According to a preferred embodiment of this invention
there is
