<ABSTRACT>
A device for inspecting the weld seam (8) of a tube (4) welded into a container (2) comprises a guide ring (10) annularly surrounding the tube (4) for a carriage (30) which can travel in its circumferential direction and system support (34) arranged on the carriage (30) for an inspection system which can be coupled to the outer wall of the container (2). A holder (14) which can be supported on the tube (4) and supports (20) which can bear on the outer wall of the container (2) are pivoted on the guide ring (10) .These measures make it possible to direct the plane of the guide ring (10) rapidly and safety parallel to the plane of the weld seam (8).

Device for inspecting the weld seam (8) of a 
connection piece (4) which is welded in a container 

(2), having 

a) a guide ring (10), which annularly surrounds the 
connection piece (4), for a carriage (30) which 

can be moved in the circumferential direction of 
the guide ring (10), 
b) an inspection-system carrier (34), which is 
arranged on the carriage (30), for an inspection 

system which can be coupled to the outer wall of 
the container (2), wherein 
c) the guide ring (10) is arranged such that it can 
be swung on a holding support (14) which can be 

supported on the connection piece (4). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the holding support (14), which can be supported 

on a flange projection (7) of the connection piece (4), 
and also a support (20), which is arranged on the guide 

ring (10) and can be laid against the outer wall of the 
container (2), are provided. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that a rail (32), on which the inspection-system 

carrier (34) can be displaced at an angle to the 
circumferential direction of the guide ring (10), is 

arranged on the carriage (30) obliquely relative to the 
plane which is clamped by the guide ring (10).
