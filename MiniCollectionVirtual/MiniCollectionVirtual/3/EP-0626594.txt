<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for determining petrophysical properties 
associated with various lateral locations of a subterranean layer. The 

method employs velocity and density log data, corresponding to a 
preselected reference lateral location, in combination with seismic data 

to determine a range of values of at least one petrophysical property 
associated with a desired lateral location ("nonreference") offset from 

the reference lateral location.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for determining
petrophysical properties of a subterranean layer which employs both
seismic data and log data.It is well known to employ logs, such as wireline well logs,
to determine valuable petrophysical properties associated with a
subterranean layer of interest. Petrophysical properties, such as
porosity, water or hydrocarbon saturation, and lithological composition
(i.e. shale or sand), provide valuable information in determining the
presence and extent of hydrocarbons in the layer of interest. However,
such logs are very limited in areal extent to only about 15.2-30.5 cm (6-12 inches)
around a borehole in which measurements are taken. Moreover, obtaining
logs such as wireline well logs can be time consuming and expensive in
requiring drilling of a borehole for each such well log.Petrophysical properties of a layer of interest can vary
widely at different locations. Therefore, accurate determination of 
variations in properties over a large area of a layer are not practical
by use of wireline well logs, since such determination would require
many, possibly hundreds or thousands, of such well logs.Seismic prospecting is effective in estimating depths to
subterranean layers, and is cost effective in surveying a large area,
but the resulting seismic data provides insufficient information to make
accurate determinations of, for example, the extent and amount of
hydrocarbons in a hydrocarbon-containing subterranean layer (hydrocarbon
reservoir).US 4,679,174 describes a method of seismic exploration of the surface of the earth.GB 1 463 060 describes a synthetic display of theoretical seismic reflection coefficients.It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a cost
effective method capable of determining petrophysical properties
associated with a subterranean layer of interest at any lateral location
thereof.The above object is realized by a method described herein as a
series of ten steps employing both seismic and log data. The method
permits accurate determination of petrophysical properties of a layer of
interest at any desired lateral location thereof. The method is cost
effective insofar as it requires minimal log data (as little as a single
set of data corresponding to a single lateral location) to be employed
with the seismic data.FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a cross-section of the
earth which shows a subterranean layer of interest having a hydrocarbon
reservoir extending therethrough. This FIGURE also schematically  
illustrates seismic
