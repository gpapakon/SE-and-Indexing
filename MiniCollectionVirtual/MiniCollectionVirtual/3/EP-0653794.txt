<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric thin film 
device and a method for manufacturing the same. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a dielectric thin 
film device for use in non-volatile memory devices, 
capacitors, light modulation devices, piezoelectric devices 
and pyroelectric infrared rays sensors or the like, and a 
method for manufacturing the same. Generally speaking, capacitors comprising a dielectric 
thin film accumulate an electric charge in DRAM's or the 
like. As a material for the dielectric thin film for 
capacitors, SiO₂ (silicon oxide) is primarily used. 
Furthermore, a higher integration of semiconductor device is 
demanded in recent years so that high dielectric thin films 
have been researched which use such materials as SrTiO₃ 
(strontium titanate), (Ba, Sr) TiO₃ (barium strontium 
titanate) or the like. Also, non-volatile memories which use ferroelectric 
materials exhibiting a spontaneous polarization have been 
studied out of various kinds of dielectric materials.  
 
Examples of materials that can be used in such ferroelectric 
materials include oxides such as PZT [Pb(Zr, Ti)O₃, lead 
zirconate titanate], PbTiO₃ (lead titanate) , and BaTiO₃ 
(barium titanate) or the like. Out of such materials, PZT 
has been briskly studied as a promising material for non-volatile 
memories. Along with the miniaturization and integration of 
electronic components resulting from an advancement of the 
semiconductor technology, dielectric thin film devices have 
reduced in size and thickness. Further demand has been made 
on dielectric thin films free from defects. Methods for manufacturing dielectric thin films as 
mentioned above intend to utilize vacuum deposition method, 
sputtering method, sol-gel method, metal organic chemical 
vapor deposition (MOCVD) method or the like. The methods 
falls into two types; one type involving crystallization 
during the deposition of dielectric film forming process by 
raising temperature of substrate whereas the other type 
involving crystallization through heat treatment after the 
deposition of dielectric film. Both methods have a defect 
because when the dielectric thin film contains atom(s) that 
easily evaporates, many pin holes are formed in the 
dielectric thin film and uneven patterns on the surface 
thereof becomes larger due to reevaporation of volatile 
atom(s) during the crystallization. Thus, such dielectric 
thin film causes a problem that the leak current increases 
and the properties of cells get non-uniform. Consequently,
