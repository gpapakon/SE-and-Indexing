<DESCRIPTION>
 FIRE RESISTANT LOW TEMPERATURE GREASEThis invention relates to a fire resistant grease which is usable even at subzero temperatures.There is a need for a fire resistant grease par- ticularly one usable in subzero temperatures for lubricating bearings and other moving surfaces in mines but such greases may be useful in any other areas where fire is a hazard. Ordinary mineral lubricating base oils can obviously not be used for such greases. A convenient starting point for fire- resistant greases according to U.S. Patent 4,206,061 is the use of fire resistant hydraulic fluids as base oils, such as phosphorus acid esters or amides and more particularly trihydrocarbyl phosphates thickened with graphitic carbon. However, even with graphitic carbon as the thickener the viscosity of the base oil at subzero temperatures is unacceptable and too great to be practical. Furthermore, U.S. Patent 4,490,266 discloses that phosphate esters have an extremely poor viscosity-temperature behavior in the tempera¬ ture range of -20°C to +150°C, even though they pre¬ sent no corrosion problems and do not cause high wear at highly loaded points of friction. The patent discloses that when thickened with known polyacrylate and polyolefin viscosity modifiers the phosphate esters suffer a loss of effectiveness at high shear rates.Instead, U.S. Patent 4,490,266 teaches incor¬ porating a polyester having a weight average mole- cular weight of 20,000 to 300,000 into an aromatic phosphate ester such as tricresyl phosphate, dicresyl monophenyl phosphate, onocresyl diphenyl phosphate and other phosphate esters of monophenols, thereby improving the viscosity index measured between the temperatures of 38.7°C and 98.9°C, thereby making the esters suitable for use as a liquid hydraulic fluid. 

 U.S. Patent 4,879,054 discloses that many mecha¬ nisms such as bearings, actuator screws, guages, instruments, aircraft, vehicles, tanks, and other military equipment are required to perform well at ultra low temperatures, such as at -73°C. Lubricat¬ ing greases for such mechanisms, therefore, not only must perform well at low temperatures but also such lubricating greases must have outstanding oxidation resistance, good antiwear properties, superior pli- ability, and excellent stability at normal, as well as low temperatures. U.S. Patent 4,879,054 teaches a process for manufacturing low temperature greases employing a dialkyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid thickened with a lithium soap. However, such an extreme low temperature grease is flammable.The
