<ABSTRACT>
A voltage, replica of the difference between two 
dissimilar base-emitter voltages in the form of an 

intrinsic input offset voltage of a differential input 
pair of transistors of a noninverting, buffer-configured 

operational amplifier, is summed with a pre-established 
fraction of a base-emitter voltage, to 

produce a voltage reference without thermal drift of a 
level that can be as low as few 10mV. The intrinsic 

input offset voltage is controlled by a local feedback 
loop acting on the bias current that is forced through 

the input pair of transistors that may be realized with 
a certain area ratio. The relatively simple circuit is 

useful in battery operated, low supply voltage, 
systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a circuit
for generating a reference voltage without thermal
drift and of relatively low value, markedly lower than
the voltage of a base-emitter junction (Vbe).In many systems and particularly in monolithically
integrated systems, it is necessary to implement voltage
references, that is circuits capable of generating
a stable reference voltage, free of thermal drift.
Commonly this is achieved by employing a so-called
band-gap circuit. A band-gap circuit produces a voltage
corresponding to the sum of one or several base-emitter
voltages (Vbe), as of common bipolar junction transistors,
and of a voltage proportional to the difference
between two different base-emitter voltages,
suitably amplified by a certain amplification factor K,
so as to make the amplified difference voltage comparable
with the voltage of one or several base-emitter
junctions, in order to produce a desired reference
voltage given by:
Vref = Vbe + KΔVbe,
where   K > 1The ΔVbe term that is employed for compensating the
thermal drift of a certain sign of the particular Vbe
or sum of Vbe used, may suitably assume a thermal coefficient
of opposite sign of the thermal coefficient of
the Vbe term used. Therefore, the resulting reference
voltage Vref that is produced may be stable in terms of
temperature variations.US-A-4,524,318 discloses a circuit for generating temperature stable
reference voltage by summing a base-emitter voltage and a difference
between two base-emitter voltages, multiplied by a constant greater than
one in order to make comparable the two terms of the sum, wherein the
difference between two base-emitter voltages is derived from a pair of
transistors of different emitter-area constituting a differential stage.Commonly band-gap circuits produce a temperature compensated
voltage Vref greater or equal to about 1.2V.  On the other hand, in systems designed for operating
with relatively low supply voltages, for example in
battery powered portable instruments and apparatuses,
the supply voltage may be relatively low, for example
in the vicinity of 1.0V. This makes a correct operation
of a normal band-gap circuit impossible.Recently, a band-gap reference voltage generating
circuit has been proposed which is capable of providing
a regulated voltage of relatively low level, in the
vicinity of 200mV, which may be adjusted upward to
higher levels. This makes the voltage reference circuit
suitable also in battery powered systems with a supply
voltage of just 1V. The circuit is described
