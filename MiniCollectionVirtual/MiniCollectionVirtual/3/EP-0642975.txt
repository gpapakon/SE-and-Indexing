<ABSTRACT>
A device with a packaging wheel, for supplying sheets, in 
particular in cigarette packaging machines, comprises means 

(20, 20') for collecting/positioning the packaging sheets 
(F) in a predetermined position, in a transfer station (T), 

between a cell (101) of a transfer drum (1) which 
accomodates a group of cigarettes (S) and an empty 

cigarette-carrying cell (102) of a folding drum (2) 
opposite. During transfer into the cell (102) of the folding 

drum (2), the group of cigarettes (S) draws the sheet (F) 
which is folded automatically in a U-shape around the 

cigarettes (S) by the cigarette-carrying cell (102). 
According to the invention, the collecting/positioning means 

(20, 20') consist of mechanical gripper means for grasping 
the packaging sheet (F) which are provided at least on the 

front side of each cigarette-carrying cell (101) of the 
transfer drum (1), with reference to the direction of 

rotation of the drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device with a 
packaging wheel, for supplying sheets, in 
particular in cigarette packaging machines, which 
device comprises a drum for folding packaging 
sheets, for example made of foil, around 
individual groups of cigarettes, which is 
provided on its periphery with a plurality of 
cigarette-carrying cells, and a drum for 
transferring groups of cigarettes from a supply 
line to the folding drum which is also provided 
with at least one cigarette-carrying cell, which 
is conveyed to a transfer station, into a 
position such that it is frontally aligned with 
an empty cigarette-carrying cell of the folding 
drum, whereas the group of cigarettes is moved by 
drive means from the cell of the transfer drum 
into the cell of the folding drum, each cell of 
the transfer drum being associated with 
collecting/positioning means each for one sheet,  
 
which can be moved angularly together with the 
associated cell, and which take a sheet into a 
predetermined position corresponding to the group 
of cigarettes to be transferred between the 
associated cell of the transfer drum and the cell 
of the folding drum in the transfer station, such 
that, when the group of cigarettes is transferred 
into the cell of the folding drum, the sheet is 
thrust by the cigarettes into the said cell, and 
is folded in a U-shape around the cigarettes, and  
 
in which the 
means for collecting/positioning the packaging 
sheet consist of mechanical gripper means for 
grasping the packaging sheet, which are provided 
at least on the front side of each cigarette-carrying 
cell, with reference to the direction of 
rotation of the transfer drum. A device of this kind is known from the document GB-A-2 191 166.  
 The object of the invention is thus to 
produce a device of the type initially described, 
in which by relatively simple and inexpensive 
means, it is possible to seize the packaging 
sheet and hold it securely in position, 
simultaneously enabling its position to be 
regulated relative to the associated cell, all 
without increasing undesirably the inertial mass 
of the drum. The above-described objects are accomplished 
according to the invention by means of a device 
of the type initially described, in which  
 
each gripper means is mounted 
on the transfer drum such that it can be moved 
angularly for a specific limited arc relative to 
the cell itself, in order to regulate the 
position of the packaging sheet. According to an advantageous embodiment, the 
gripper means are mounted directly

Device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the closing means can 

consist for example of two pairs of arms (11, 
11') which are associated with the front side and 

the rear side of each cigarette-carrying cell 
(101) respectively, and which on their free ends,

support transverse tabs (13) which each close 

part of the mouth, and are mounted such as to 
oscillate around axes parallel to the axis of 

rotation of the transfer drum (1), between a 
position of reciprocal approach, in which they 

close the mouth, and a position of reciprocal 
withdrawal, or spreading apart, in which the cell

produced such that in their position in which the 
pairs of arms (11, 11') associated with the 

cigarette-carrying cell (101) in the transfer 
station (T) are spread apart, the cams give rise 

to movement of the said pairs of arms (11, 11') 
substantially in the same direction, with slight 

rotation thereof, giving rise to simultaneous 
translation of the two pairs of arms (11, 11') in 

the same direction and for a substantially 
identical angular amplitude relative to the 

cigarette-carrying cell (101), in either 
direction, according to the direction of angular 

movement of the cams (114, 214).
