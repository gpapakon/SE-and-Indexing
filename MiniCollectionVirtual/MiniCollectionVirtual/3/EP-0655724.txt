<ABSTRACT>
A display memory (15) for a display system (10, 20) having a spatial 
light modulator (SLM) (16). The memory (15) receives data in pixel format 

and delivers the data to the SLM (16) in bit-plane format. The memory (15) 
avoids the need for double buffering by reading out bit-planes that are 

comprised partly of data from one data from and partly of data from an 
adjacent data frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image display systems, and more particularly
to
a method of using a memory for storing data
for use in a display system having a processor for processing pixel data
and having a spatial light modulator for generating an image.Real-time display systems based on spatial light modulators (SLMs)
are increasingly being used as an alternative to display systems using
cathode ray tubes (CRTs). SLM systems provide high resolution displays
without the bulk and power consumption of a CRT system.Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) are a type of SLM, and may be
used in projection display applications. A DMD has an array of micromechanical
pixel elements, each having a mirror and a memory cell. Each
pixel element is individually addressable by electronic data. Depending on
the state of its addressing signal, each mirror element is tilted so that it
either does or does not reflect light to the image plane. Other SLMs operate
on similar principles, with pixel elements that emit or reflect light
simultaneously with other pixel elements, such that a complete image frame
is generated by addressing pixel elements rather than by scanning them. For processing data in an SLM-based systems, as is the case with other
digital image processing systems, the processor operates on pixel data.
Interlaced data is arranged pixel-by-pixel, row-by-row, and field-by-field.
Scan conversion techniques are used to generate frames from fields. Non-interlaced
data is already arranged as frames. Processing tasks such as
colorspace conversion and scaling, as well as scan conversion, are performed
on the pixel data.However, in an SLM-based system, the SLM must receive the data in
"bit-planes". In other words, pixel data must be reformatted into bit-level
data so that each pixel element can be "on" or "off' a length of time
corresponding to the value of its pixel data. Various modulation schemes
determine how long each pixel is on or off, and permit greyscale and color
images to be displayed. A bit-plane represents all bits of all pixels having the
same digital weight. For pixels having an n-bit resolution, there are n bit-planes
per display frame.SLM-based systems use a "display memory" to provide bit-planes of
data to the SLM. Existing display memories are "double buffered", so that
they can store data for a current frame while data for a next frame is being
written in. This permits each frame of data to be read out of memory and
displayed on the SLM during its own frame period. Many display memories
operating in this

A method of using a memory (15) for storing data for use
in a display system (10; 20) having a processor (14) for

processing pixel data and having a spatial light modulator

of:

writing a first frame of samples of pixel data to said
memory (15) during a first frame period;
writing a second frame comprised of samples of pixel
data to said memory (15) during a second frame period, such

that each sample of said second frame is written over the
corresponding sample of said first frame;
reading a bit-plane of data from said memory (15);
repeating said reading step such that at least the same
number of bit-planes as the number of bits representing each

pixel intensity are read out during a display period;
wherein one or more of the reading steps are performed
with data from said first data frame and data from said

second data frame;
delivering each of said bit-planes to said spatial
light modulator (16);
wherein all of said steps are repeated to generate a
continuous display of images.

in contiguous rows of said memory (15). 
The method of claim 1, wherein said writing steps occur
in randomly accessible rows of said memory (15).
The method of claim 1, wherein said memory (15) is
partitioned into multiple areas and said writing and reading

steps occur in parallel for each partition of said memory
(15).
The method of claim 1, wherein said writing step is
performed with one or more input registers, to which data is

written in pixel format, and with a memory array (52), which
receives bit level data from said one or more input

The method of claim 1, wherein said reading step is
performed with two or more output registers, which receive

bit-level data from a memory array (52) and which select

The method of claim 1, wherein said reading step is
performed once for each of said bit planes.
The method of claim 1, wherein said reading step is
performed more than once for one or more of said bit-planes.
