<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a high-voltage circuit breaker capable of cutting off alternating fault currents with pseudo-period T and with delayed zero crossing, passing through zero after a maximum length of time tzmax-t0 after the instant t0 at which the fault appears, this length of time tzmax-t0 being determined by simulations or by trials, comprising a plurality of cutoff chambers (1) in series equipped with means for being opened at an instant t1 subsequent to the instant of the fault t0 and with means of blowing of the arc designed to operate between the instant t1 and an instant tc prior to the instant tzmax-T. It includes means for reducing the blowing throughput which are adapted so that the blowing is prolonged up to an instant t2 lying between tzmax-T and tzmax+T.
