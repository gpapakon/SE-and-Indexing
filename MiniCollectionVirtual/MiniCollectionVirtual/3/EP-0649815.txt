<ABSTRACT>
Highly microporous activated carbons are prepared by further chemical 
activation of activated carbon comprising activation of an active carbon precursor 

material with an alkali solution, pre-drying the blend to below about 25% moisture 
content, heat treating this blend at from about 650° to about 1100°C, and acid 

washing and drying the microporous activated carbon products, which are 
characterized by greater than 50% of total pore volume comprising pores of from 

above 8Å to 20Å in width and greater than 70% of total pore volume comprising 
pores of less than 20Å in width and greater than 95% of total pore volume 

comprising pores of less than 50Å in width and which is disclosed for storing gaseous 
hydrocarbon fuel in storage containers under relatively low pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the improved production of activated
carbon. More particularly, it is directed to the production of highly microporous
activated carbon. Specifically, the present invention is directed to the production of
highly microporous activated carbon from an activated carbon material by a
subsequent chemical activation process employing an alkali, such as potassium hydroxide. One use of
such activated carbon is in the adsorption of gaseous hydrocarbon fuels, including
natural gas.Practical storage of gaseous hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas which is
comprised primarily of methane, for such uses as a vehicle fuel and the like involves
portable containerization of the gas. Natural gas, in particular, is a leading contender
for use as an alternative fuel for automobiles, particularly in areas designated as "zero
emission" zones under the 1990 Clean Air Act. The majority of natural gas vehicles
operating in the United States use compressed natural gas at pressures of up to
3600 psi. However, low pressure storage systems are being developed in which
natural gas is contained in storage containers packed with adsorbent material to 
achieve near-liquid methane density. The storage containers may be formable or
nonformable tanks, cylinders, or other closed vessels. Economic evaluations by the
natural gas industry indicate that adsorbed natural gas (ANG) would be comparable
economically with compressed natural gas (CNG) at a deliverable gas capacity of
150 volumes of gas per container (cylinder) volume (v/v) at a storage pressure of 35150 kg/m2
[500 psi](measured at 25°C).Natural gas, which is primarily methane, is adsorbed in pores and on surfaces
of the adsorbent medium. Under such conditions, the adsorbed gas assumes
properties not unlike those of its liquid state. Typical adsorbents are solids with
pores and fissures throughout their structure. Methane molecules preferentially
adsorb in pores having a diameter of about 10-15 Angstroms (Å). The carbon
material of the present invention may also be suitable for storage of other gases of a
similar molecular size.Active carbon has long been used for removal of impurities and recovery of
useful substances from liquids and gases because of its high adsorptive capacity.
Generally, "activation" refers to any of the various processes by which the pore
structure is enhanced. Typical commercial activated carbon products exhibit a
surface area (as measured by nitrogen adsorption as used in the B.E.T. model) of at
least 300 m2/g. For the
