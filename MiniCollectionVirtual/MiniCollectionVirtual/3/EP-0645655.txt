<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a winding cassette 1 for receiving the excess lengths of cables, in particular optical fibre cables 2, having a carrier board 3 with arcuate guide elements 8, 9 arranged at the edges 4. In order to avoid a crossover of loops, received in the winding cassette 1, of the excess lengths of cables 2, a plurality of arcuate guide elements 8, 9 are arranged in a spatially offset manner on arcs of circles of different radii 16, 17.

<CLAIMS>
Winding cassette (1) for receiving a splice
organizer (7) and an excess length of at least one

cable (2), in particular an optical-fibre cable,
comprising a support plate (3) with guide elements (8,

9, 10), 
characterized in that
 hold-down devices (5)
with inwardly protruding holding ribs (6) are provided

on the narrow and longitudinal sides (14, 18) of the
winding cassette (1) and 
in that
 a plurality of arcuate
guide elements (8, 9, 10) are provided at different

distances from the narrow sides (4), the guide elements
(8, 9) being arranged on concentric arcs of different

radii and holding ribs (19) of the guide elements (8,
9) being directed radially outwards, the splice

organizer (7) also being arranged between the
concentric guide elements (8, 9) in such a way that the

cable (2), in particular an optical-fibre cable, can be
led around the splice organizer (7), the guide elements

(8, 9) being positioned in such a way that the cable
(2), in particular an optical-fibre cable, can be

routed in such a way that separate laying paths without
crossing points are produced, the cable (2) being

routed in defined loops with their own winding grooves.
Winding cassette according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the guide elements (8, 9, 10) are
disposed such that they can be fitted on the support

plate (3) in a way corresponding to the desired cable
routing. 
Winding cassette according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the guide elements (8, 9, 10)
allow any desired routing of the cable (2), arranged in

a superjacent or adjacent manner, such as for example a
meandering, spiralling, looping or concentric routing.
Method of introducing excess lengths of cables,
in particular optical-fibre cables, into a winding

cassette with guide elements according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 guide elements (8, 9, 10) of
different geometry are positioned in the winding

cassette in such a way that separate laying paths or
crossing points are produced for the cables, the

arcuate guide elements (8, 9) being arranged on
concentric circles of different radii (16, 17) and the

cables being routed in defined loops with their own
winding grooves, the splice organizer (7) also being

arranged between the concentric guide elements (8, 9),
so that the cable (2), in particular an optical-fibre

cable, can be led around the splice organizer (7).
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 spatially separate guide elements (8, 9) for
separate laying paths of the cables are positioned in

the winding cassette (1) at points at which forces act
on the cable towards the interior of the cassette and

common guide elements (5, 6) for a common, parallel
laying path of the cables are positioned in the winding

cassette (1) at points at which outwardly directed
forces act on the cable.
