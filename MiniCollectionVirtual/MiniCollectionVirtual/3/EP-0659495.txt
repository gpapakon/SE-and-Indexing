<ABSTRACT>
A housingless roll stand has parallel first and second 
rolls (12,14) extending transversely with respect to the 

mill passline (P). The roll ends of the first roll (12) 
are journalled for rotation in bearings (16) contained in 

first chock assemblies (18) and the roll ends of the 
second roll (14) are journalled for rotation in bearings 

(16) contained in second chock assemblies (20). Each of 
the first chock assemblies is arranged adjacent to a 

second chock assembly on a respective side of the mill 
pass line. Pairs of identically configured screw shafts 

(22) interconnect each of the first chock assemblies to 
the adjacent second chock assembly. The screw shafts each 

have a first threaded section (22a) threadedly engaged 
with the respective first chock assembly and an opposite 

hand second threaded section (22c) threadedly engaged with 
the respective second chock assembly. The screw shafts 

are simultaneously rotated to effect roll parting 
adjustments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to rolling mills, and 
is concerned in particular with an improved system for 
adjusting the roll parting between rolls in so-called 
"housingless stands". In the conventional housingless stand, the ends of 
a pair of rolls are journalled for rotation in bearings 
contained in chock assemblies, and the chock assemblies 
on each side of the roll stand are interconnected by 
pairs of screw shafts which take up the roll separating 
forces during rolling. The screw shafts have opposite 
hand threaded sections and are contra-rotated to effect 
parting adjustments between the rolls. One problem encountered with known housingless stands 
is that two differently configured screw shafts are 
required to make up the pairs on each side of the roll 
stand. For example, in a horizontal mill, one screw 
shaft will typically have left and right hand threaded 
sections engaged respectively with the upper and lower 
chock assemblies, whereas the other screw shaft will be 
oppositely configured with right and left hand threaded 
sections engaged respectively with the same chock 
assemblies. The need to provide differently configured 
screw shafts unnecessarily complicates maintenance 
procedures, and also adds significantly to spare parts 
inventory expenditures.  A further problem with conventional designs is that 
the screw shafts are powered by unnecessarily complicated 
drive mechanisms including large gear boxes which impede 
ready access to the roll stand and which also interfere 
with close stand stacking along the mill pass line. An object of the present invention is provide an 
improved housingless stand where roll parting is 
controlled by pairs of identically configured screw 
shafts on each side of the mill pass line. A companion objective of the present invention is to 
simplify and reduce the physical size of the drive 
mechanisms used to power the screw shafts. According to the present invention, a housingless roll 
stand has parallel first and second rolls extending 
transversely with respect to the mill pass line. The 
roll ends of the first roll are journalled for rotation 
in bearings contained in first chock assemblies, and the 
roll ends of the second roll are similarly journalled 
for rotation in bearings contained in second chock 
assemblies. Each of the first chock assemblies is 
arranged adjacent to a second chock assembly on a 
respective side of the mill pass line. Identically 
configured screw shafts interconnect the adjacent first 
and second chock assemblies.

<CLAIMS>
A housingless roll stand having parallel firs and 
second rolls (12,14) extending transversely with respect 

to the mill pass line (P), the roll ends of said first 
roll (12) being journalled for rotation in bearing (16) 

contained in first chock assemblies (18) and the roll 
ends of said second roll (14) being journalled for 

rotation in bearings (16) contained in second chock 
assemblies (20), each of said first chock assemblies being 

arranged adjacent to a second chock assembly on a 
respective side of the mill pass line, apparatus for 

adjusting the parting between said rolls, said apparatus 
comprising: 

   pairs of identically conjured screw shafts (22) 
interconnecting each of said chock assemblies to the 

adjacent second chock assembly, said screw shafts each 
having a first threaded section (22a) threadedly engaged 

with the respective first chock assembly and an opposite 
hand second threaded section (22c) threadedly engaged with 

the respective second chock assembly; and drive means for 
simultaneously rotating the screw shafts of each of said 

pairs in a common direction. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said screw 
shafts are rotatably supported by and axially fixed 

 
with respect to shelf members (28) interposed between 

adjacent first and second chock assemblies, and support 
means (30) on opposite sides of the mill pass line for 

supporting said shelves. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein said support 
means (30) comprise pedestals, and wherein means (32) are 

provided for detachably securing said shelf members to 
said pedestals. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said drive means comprises pinion gears 

(38) carried on each of said screw shafts, the pinion 
gears of each pair of screw shafts being in meshed 

relationship with a third pinion gear (40) interposed 

therebetween, a worm gear (46) arranged coaxially with 
and rotationally fixed with respect to each of said third 

pinion gears, each of said worm gears being in meshed 
relationship with a worm carried on a common rotatable 

drive shaft (48). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the threaded sections of said screw shafts 

are in threaded engagement with nut members (24) 
comprising integral components of said chock assemblies. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 further comprising 
 

means (34) for exerting separating forces on adjacent 
first and second chock assemblies in directions parallel 

to their respective interconnecting screw shafts.
