<ABSTRACT>
A small gas turbine, especially for powering model aircraft, with a casing (3), a compressor impeller (1, 2), a combustion chamber (15-17) and a turbine wheel (5), in which the turbine wheel (5) drives the compressor impeller (1, 2) via a shaft running in a shaft tunnel (8) passing through the combustion chamber (15-17) which is surrounded by a helical fuel supply and evaporator pipe (22, 23), in which the combustion chamber (15-17) is bounded by a cylindrical outer wall (15) and a truncated conical inner wall (16) having combustion air inlets (19-21). The outlet end of the combustion chamber inner wall (16) enters, forming an annular gap, a cylindrical flow body (6, 7) which in turn, also forming an annular gap, lies in the central aperture of the vane ring (4) on the turbine side and is supported by the end (9) of the shaft tunnel (8). The other end of the shaft tunnel (8) is secured to the casing (3) between the compressor impeller (1, 2) and the front wall (17) of the combustion chamber.
