<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new silacyclohexane compound,
a method of preparing it, and a liquid crystal composition
which contains it as well as a liquid crystal display element
which contains said liquid crystal composition.A liquid crystal display element utilizes the optical
anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances.
Display methods include the TN mode (twisted nematic mode),
the STN mode (super twisted nematic mode), the SBE mode (super
birefringence mode), the DS mode (dynamic scattering mode),
the guest-host mode, the DAP mode ("deformation of aligned
phase" mode) and the OMI mode (optical mode interference mode).
The most common display device has a twisted nematic structure
based on the Schadt-Helfrich mode.Properties required of the liquid crystal substance
used in these liquid crystal displays are somewhat different 
depending on the display mode. However, a wide liquid crystal
temperature range and stability against moisture, air, light,
heat, electric fields, etc. are commonly required in all display
methods. Furthermore, it is desirable for the liquid crystal
material to have a low viscosity, and also to have a short
address time, low threshold voltage and high contrast in the
cell(s).Currently, there is no single compound which satisfies
all these requirements. In practice, liquid crystal mixtures
are obtained by mixing several to more than ten liquid crystal
compounds and liquid crystal like compounds. Because of this,
it is also important that components of a liquid crystal composition
mix easily each other.Liquid crystal compounds which can be used as these
components can be classified into the following categories:
1) Compounds which contribute to a reduction in viscosity
and a lowering of the melting point of the mixed liquid crystal
composition2) Compounds which mainly control the electro-optical functions
of the mixed liquid crystal composition 3) Compounds which contribute to raising the clearing point
of the mixed liquid crystal composition 4) Compounds which contribute to refractive anisotropy of
the mixed liquid crystal composition 5) Compounds which control the colored display and orientation 
of the mixed liquid crystal composition For compounds which belong to category 1) in this
classification, compounds with so-called PCH structure such
as

(Japanese examined patent publication (Tokko) Sho 56-38146),

(Tokko Sho 64-373), and

(Tokko Hei 1-38772)
have been known.In recent years, along with the expansion of the applications
of liquid crystal displays,
