<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a treatment process for obtaining a non-permanent reshaping of human keratinous fibres, especially hair (setting), which consists in (i) bringing a gas containing water vapour and whose temperature is at least 75 DEG C into contact, for a period not exceeding 2 minutes, with human keratinous fibres maintained under mechanical tension and to which a composition containing at least one oil has been applied, (ii) cooling the fibres thus treated, and lastly (iii) eliminating the mechanical tension which was applied to the fibres. Hair is thereby obtained which displays long-lasting attractive curls and exceptional cosmetic properties of softness and smoothness.

<CLAIMS>
Treatment process for the non-permanent reshaping
of human keratinous fibres, especially hair, characterized

in that it consists (i) in bringing a gas containing
water vapour, and the temperature of which is at least

75째C, into contact for a time not exceeding 2 minutes
with human keratinous fibres maintained under mechanical

tension and to which a composition containing at least
one oil has been applied, with the exception of silicone

oils, (ii) in cooling the fibres thus treated, and lastly
(iii) in removing the mechanical tension which was

applied to the fibres.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said gas has a temperature above or equal to

85째C.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the said temperature is between 85째C and 150째C.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said gas is brought

into contact with the fibre to be reshaped for a time
ranging from 0.01 second to 2 minutes.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the said time is between 0.01 second and 30 seconds.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the said time is between 1 second and 10 seconds.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the application of the gas

is repeated several times on the same fibre.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said gas contains only 

water vapour.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the said gas contains water vapour

and at least one other compound in gas or vapour form.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the said gas contains water vapour and air.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the oil is chosen from oils

of animal, vegetable, mineral or synthetic origin, with
the exception of silicone oils.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the oil is chosen from liquid paraffins, paraffin

oils and isoparaffinic oils.
