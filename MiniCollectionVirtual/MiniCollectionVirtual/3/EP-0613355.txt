<ABSTRACT>
An improved pad and pad tube connector is utilized with a urine aspiration system having a vacuum pump and collection reservoir. The improved pad utilizes a perforated tube, within its volume, and is surrounded by a wicking structure which wicks liquid away from the volume of the pad and towards the central perforated tube, and frictionally engages the absorptive material in the pad to provide greater pad stability. The improved connector of the present invention engages the centrally located perforated tube within the pad at a point near the end of the pad, as well as the material surrounding the pad, for a more secure attachment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorptive aspiratable 
pads for use in urine collection and disposal systems 
and, more particularly, to an improved pad which is more 
efficient in the urine collection and disposal task. Incontinence in wheelchair and bed patients, whether in 
hospitals, nursing homes, or at home, presents a 
particular and continuing problem with respect to the 
care of such patients. Bodily incontinence is even more 
prevalent among the elderly. For anatomical reasons, the 
design of urine collection appliances for women is 
particularly difficult. In an effort to keep bed patients' bedding clean and dry 
so that the patient may be as comfortable as possible, it 
is frequently necessary to change the bedding several 
times a day for a patient having urinary incontinence. 
After a urinary discharge, there is a delay before the 
attendant becomes aware of the soiled and wet bedding so 
that steps can be taken to replace it. It is during this 
time that the patient is in contact with the urine-soaked 
bedding and is most prone to develop a rash or sores due 
to such exposure. Similar problems arise with respect to 
incontinent patients confined to wheelchairs. In the above-mentioned circumstances of a patient lacking 
the requisite mobility or self-management of the effects 
of their incontinence, the use of disposable absorbent 
pads of some kind have been previously employed. There 
are many such disposable pads commercially available for 
this purpose, such as pads normally involving an  
 
absorbent core, typically a cellulose wadding or other 
hydroscopic material. The problem with pads of this 
construction is their inability to receive and retain 
urine at significantly high flow rates or volumes without 
leakage. In addition, the pads are typically bulky, 
either when wet from use or in the dry state, and still 
effectively require the need for repeated replacement, at 
considerable inconvenience, and, therefore, cost to those 
in attendance with the patient. Replacement of the urine 
soaked bulky pads involves handling the pads, which is an 
unpleasant task. Further, repeated replacement is also 
associated with the inconvenience of storing a great 
number of pads to be ready for use, and the disposal of 
a large number of pads, creating a volumetric disposal 
problem. Earlier attempts at dealing with the urinary incontinence 
problem include U.S. Patents Nos. 3,349,768, 4,246,901, 
4,610,675, 4,713,065, 4,200,102 and 4,886,508, and GB-A-2,148,126 
and FR-A-1,485,683.

<CLAIMS>
An absorptive aspiratable pad (21) comprising an 
elongate fluid impermeable lower liner (71), defining a 

planar surface forming the bottom and at least a portion 
of the sides of the pad (21), bulk absorbent material 

(69) supported by and co-extensive with the impermeable 

lower liner (71) and covered by a layer of non-wetting 
permeable material (25), which substantially envelopes 

the lower liner (71), the bulk absorbent material (69) 
and an elongate tube (59) having a multiplicity of 

perforations situated within the permeable material (25) 
and in fluid contact with the bulk absorbent material 

(69), characterised in that a first layer of wicking 
material (55) is attached to the elongate tube (59) and 

extends substantially the length of and in contact with 
the bulk absorbent material (69) and that a second layer 

of wicking material (57) is attached to the elongate tube 
(59) and to the first layer of elongate wicking material 

(55), whereby the first and second layers (55, 57) of 
wicking material and the elongate tube (59) form a wicked 

tube assembly (53). 
A pad as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the bulk 
absorbent material (69) substantially covers the length  

 
of the wicked tube assembly (53). 
A pad as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein 
the elongate tube (59) and the first and second layers 

(55, 57) of wicking material lie outside of and adjacent 
the bulk absorbent material (69) opposite the elongate 

fluid impermeable lower liner (71). 
A pad as claimed in Claims 1 or 2 wherein 
the elongate tube (59) and the first and second layers 

(55, 57) of wicking material lie outside of and adjacent 
the bulk absorbent material (69) and adjacent the 

elongate fluid impermeable lower liner (71). 
A pad as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the elongate 
tube (59) and the first and second layers (55, 57) of 

wicking material lie substantially within the bulk 
absorbent material (69).
