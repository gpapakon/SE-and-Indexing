<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator door construction is disclosed which includes door rail elements (44, 46, 48, 50) formed from a foamed polymeric substance. At least one substantially transparent panel (28) is supported, retained by and sealed in the door rail. Connection elements (134, 140) are provided for connecting the door rail elements. At least one hinge is provided for allowing pivotal movement of the door about an axis. The foam rail element may also form one or more spacer elements (190, 194) between adjacent panels so that separate, discrete spacer bars may be eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to refrigerator display
case doors and more particularly to refrigerator display
case doors which may be formed from a foamed polymeric material which may
allow a door having an all-glass front. This invention also
relates to a refrigerator display case door whereby a
portion of the rail of the door serves as a spacer between
multiple glazing panels.Commercial refrigerators and refrigerator display cases
are used in markets, food-vending operations, liquor stores
and the like for the simultaneous preservation of freshness
and attractive display of foods to the customer. Typically,
commercial display cases have frames defining an opening for
the case which is accessed through large, swinging doors
having large areas of multi-layered glazing to permit the
customer to see, select and access the refrigerated product
easily, while preventing heat transfer into the refrigerated
space. Typically, a metal door rail supports and surrounds
the multi-layered glazing to support the glazing panels and
to protect the edges thereof.Present commercial glass refrigerator doors typically
have door rails which extend peripherally around the glass
panels of the doors. Such door rails are used to hold the
glass panels in place and extend peripherally around both
the inside and outside glass surfaces of the doors. As a
result, the door rails can be seen from the outside of the
doors, detracting from the appearance of the glass doors.Door rails have heretofore been formed from extruded or
other forms of metal rail elements fastened together at
mitered corners of upper and lower horizontal rail members
and left and right vertical side members. The hardware for
connecting the corners of the rail structure quite often is 
complicated, using a significant number of interfitting
parts to provide a suitable corner connection. Hinge
elements support the door for pivotable movement relative to
a vertical axis.The metal rail members, while providing suitable
structural support and pleasing aesthetic appearance,
readily conduct heat from outside the refrigerated display
case as well as serving as a condensation surface for water
vapor which may be present in the ambient air. To eliminate
condensation and fogging, heater wires are sometimes placed
in the door rail to warm the metal rail and to thus inhibit
condensation. To change the aesthetic appearance, some
rails have been redesigned to place a substantial amount of
the metal rail behind the front panel, but there still
exists rail material that extends

<CLAIMS>
A door (26) for a refrigerator unit (20), comprising:

a plurality of panels (28, 186, 192, 196) including a forward panel (186);
a door rail element (44, 46, 48, 50, 176) for supporting the plurality of
panels (28); and
at least one hinge (34) for allowing pivotal movement of the door (26)
about an axis; wherein
no portion of the door rail element (44, 176)
overlaps the front of the forward panel (186) and the door rail element (44,

176) includes at least one spacer element (190, 194) extending from the door
rail element (44, 176) into a space between adjacent panels (186, 192, 196) of

the plurality of panels (28, 186, 192, 196) and characterised in that the spacer element (190,
194) is part of the door rail element (44, 176).
The door of claim 1 wherein the door rail element (44, 176) is formed
from a foamed polymeric substance.
The door of claim 2 wherein the polymeric substance is polyvinyl
chloride.
The door of claim 1 wherein the spacer element (190, 194) is bonded to
the adjacent glazing panels (186, 192, 196) by a sealing compound.
The door of claim 1 wherein the spacer element (194) includes a non-uniform
surface (198) for engaging a complementary surface on the door rail

element (178).
