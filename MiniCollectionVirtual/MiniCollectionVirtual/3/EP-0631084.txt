<ABSTRACT>
The supporting ring (2) is immovably fixed onto the connecting funnel (1) which it encloses round the outside of its mouth. The support ring consists of two half cup shaped pieces (3,4) spaced apart by a distance (A) at their abutting part. The support ring and connecting hose funnel have interlocking claws. When softened by heat, the funnel is pressed against the inner periphery of the support ring.

<CLAIMS>
A hose connector (1) which is made of a material 
which can be softened under the effect of heat and is 

reinforced in the region of the mouth by a supporting 
ring (2) made of a non-settling, anti-creep material, 

characterized in that the supporting ring (2) is fixed on 
the hose connector (1) so as to be non-displaceable and 

surrounds the hose connector (1) only on the outside in 
the region of the mouth. 
A hose connector according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the supporting ring (2) is embedded 

in the hose connector (1) flush with the surface. 
A hose connector according to either of claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the supporting ring (2) is 

composed of two semi-shells (3, 4). 
A hose connector according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the semi-shells (3, 4) have a 

specific spacing (A) from one another in the region of 
the joints. 
A hose connector according to any of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the supporting ring (2) and the 

hose connector (1) have claws (5) which engage in one 

another. 
A hose connector according to any of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the hose connector (1) is 

pressed against the inside circumference of the 
supporting ring (2) in the thermally softened state. 
A hose connector according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the hose connector (1) is produced 

by blow-moulding.
