<ABSTRACT>
A specified and designated, non-primary color 
print (imaging) is applied to a substrate (paper) (43) 

by mixing at least first and second differently colored 
toner particles having substantially uniform physical 

characteristics, and introducing them in desired 
proportions into a fluidized bed (16). The toner powders 

are uniformly mixed together in the fluidized bed (as by 
using rotors (17) in addition to applying fluidizing air to 

the bed), and then a substantially uniform electrostatic 
charge (e.g. about +6.5-+8 kV D.C., which can be applied by 

blades on the rotor) is applied to the bed, and then the 
electrostatically charged mixture of toner particles is 

applied to the substrate (43), to image uniform non-primary 
color symbols on the substrate. The uniform physical 

characteristics of the powders are size (the vast majority 
of particles having a size between about 5 µm and 

about 25 µm), a resistivity of greater than 10¹² ohm-cm, 
and a flowability between a predefined minimum and 

maximum. When utilizing the fluidized bed as according to 
the invention, slight changes in chemical composition of 

the toners may be easily accommodated without change in the 
resulting uniform imaging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of applying non-primary color print
to a substrate and to a fluidised bed of toner particles for such a method.Colour toners are used in a variety of applications by both copiers and
non-impact printers. Most of the toners commercially utilized are of the
dual component type in which the toning system has larger magnetic carrier
beads around which smaller pigmented toner particles attach themselves.
The control of the toning system is achieved by a magnetic field associated
with an applicator roller. The toner particles attach themselves to the
magnetic beads by means of an electrostatic force generated by the
electrostatic charge of the toner particle itself. It is that charge which also
reacts to the force generated by the latent electrostatic image on the
photoconductive cylinder, thus developing the image with toner. The
electrostatic charge is generated by the triboelectric charging of the particle,
that is the static charge generated by the toner particles rubbing and
tumbling against the agitator, the sides of the toner sump, and each other.
The triboelectric properties of the particles are determined by the
composition of the toner particles themselves. Some particles are coated by
surface additives to steer the particles toward the right polarity and the right
magnitude of charge. However, any change in toner composition, even if
slight, can totally change the charging characteristics, and thus the quality
of the print produced.Using present toners and development systems it is extremely difficult
to blend the toners uniformly because of the dependence of the tribo
charging of the toner upon the composition of the toner used. To get two 
formulations to behave together as desired would be luck, rather than a
reproducible event. Therefore some systems have introduced multi-color
capability by the mixing of primary process colors on the paper. For
example the Canon (RTM) CLC uses four toners, each imaging on a separate
pass of the imaging cylinder, then mixing at the paper to form the desired
color level. Of course this is expensive and has minimal throughput. The
E-Print 1000 by Indigo attempts to do a similar job with liquid toner. In each
case, though, four separate color toners must be utilized to create the
desired color level with the complication of four developing stations.It is highly desirable to provide a simple charging and developing
system which, by using specific primary colors of toners, would allow pre-blending
before charging the system, to
