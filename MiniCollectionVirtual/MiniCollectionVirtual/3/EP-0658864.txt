<ABSTRACT>
Marking device intended to be detected at the moment of its entry into monitoring regions, and to send out an alarm signal whenever an attempt is made to dismantle it from the article which carries it. The device according to the invention includes an electronic module (13) and a detection ring, an electrical characteristic of which is modified when an attempt is made to withdraw the said marking device from the article which carries it.

<CLAIMS>
A marking device intended to be detected as it
passes into surveillance zones and to emit an alarm

signal as soon as an attempt is made to dismantle it
from the article bearing it, of the type comprising an

electronic circuit having a detection ring (9) one
electrical characteristic of which is modified when an

attempt is made to remove said marking device from the
article bearing it, and an electronic module (5)

capable of detecting the modification of the detection
ring and of informing the surveillance means thereof,

characterised in that it forms a bottle cap formed of a
stopper (31) and a crimping ring (30), and the

detection ring (35) is arranged partially in the
stopper (31) and partially in the crimping ring (30).
A marking device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that it comprises fuses which can be

destroyed by a destruction signal induced in the
electronic circuit.
A marking device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that a capacitor ensures an energy

reserve.
A marking device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the electrical

continuity of the detection ring is destroyed when an
attempt is made to remove said marking device from the

article bearing it.
A marking device according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the electronic module

detects the variation in resistance of the detection 
ring when an attempt is made to remove the label from

the article bearing it.
A marking device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that it comprises at

least one receiving/transmitting antenna (14, 24, 34).
A marking device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the electronic

module is capable of dialoguing with the surveillance
means.
