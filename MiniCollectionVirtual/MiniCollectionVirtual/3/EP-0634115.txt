<ABSTRACT>
Ski boot with improved lateral support including a 
shell (2) connected to a quarter (4) and having a rigid 

element (5) which is monolithic or formed integrally with 
the shell and at least partially affects the inner side of 

the foot and leg and the plantar arch. The boot allows to 
achieve optimum ski control by distributing the efforts and 

ensuring rear support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ski boot with
improved lateral support.The problem of transmitting the efforts of the foot to
the ski in an efficient manner, so as to achieve optimum
control of said ski, is nowadays strongly felt for ski
boots.In this regard, some solutions are known, related or
aimed directly at these problems. Among them, mention should
be made of U.S. patent 3,545,103 which discloses a ski boot
closure device comprising a metallic lateral plate that
laterally surrounds the outer part of the foot and with
which a cuff is rotatably associated.Although this plate stiffens the boot to a given
extent, it nonetheless does not provide optimum transmission
of the efforts from the foot to the ski. In current skiing
technique, the ski is in fact controlled by the inner part
of the leg and of the foot, and this is therefore the part
of the ski boot that is most intensely stressed during
skiing and that transmits the efforts.The placement of the plate on the outer side in the
prior patent is therefore not effective for precise ski
control.Italian patent no. 1,051,302 discloses a ski boot made
of plastics which is substantially constituted by two shells
that mutually overlap along lateral joining lines and are
kept in this closed position by fastening means.This solution, which has the purpose of providing a
method for manufacturing the boot in a mold without back
drafts, entails the presence of parts that allow to adapt it 
to devices for binding to the ski, as well as a framework
formed by thick and rigid ridges and by thin flat portions
that connect said ridges.Although it partially solves the described technical
problem, as the ridges affect both the outer side and the
inner side of the boot, even this solution does not allow to
achieve optimum transmission of efforts from the foot to the
ski, because in controlling the ski, the efforts are
discharged approximately at the region of the plantar arch.
In the solution illustrated in the patent, this region is
not affected by the rigid ridges but by the thin flat
portions.Furthermore, the arrangement and shape of the ridges in
any case causes the boot to be subject to slight
deformations during sports practice that help to reduce the
optimum transmission of efforts to the ski.IT-A-1210429 (Italian Patent application no. 82513 A/87)
discloses a ski boot which is constituted by a semirigid
innerboot with which it is possible to associate at least
one first rigid element, which partially surrounds the lower
and lateral regions of the semirigid
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Ski boot with lateral support, comprising
at least one quarter (4,204,304) associated with a shell

(2,202,302), and at least one rigid element (5,105,205,305)
which is monolithic, or formed integrally, with said shell,

said rigid element comprising a first flap (7,107,207,307)
connected to said ski boot and located adjacent the foot

inner side (6,206,306) and the leg inner side (8,208,308) of
the ski boot, said first flap having a first wing

(9,109,209,309) extending from a region overlying the heel
(19) past the region in front of the heel to the metatarsal

region of the ski boot, and said rigid element further
comprising an arm (10,110,210,310) extending from said first

wing beneath the plantar arch (11,211,311) of the ski boot.
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in that
said at least one rigid element is formed monolithically and

has no moving components, and said first flap is fixed to
said shell and quarter at studs (3,203,303).
Ski boot according to claim 2, characterized in that
said first flap is essentially L-shaped.
Ski boot according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a second wing (12)

of said first flap protrudes from an upper perimetric edge
(13) of said at least one quarter and then surrounds it to

the rear and is connected, by means of a first bridge (14),
to a second flap (15) that affects the outer side (16) of

the leg, said second flap being fixed at said studs (3) at
the end that is arranged approximately adjacent to a

malleolar region (17).
Ski boot according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said first and second flaps are mutually connected, by means

of a second bridge (18), at a region that lies above the
heel (19).
Ski boot according to any one or more of the
preceding claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said at least

one rigid element (105) is constituted by a single first
flap (107).
Ski boot according to any one or more of the
preceding claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said at least

one rigid element (205) has a second wing (212) directly
connected to said shell (202), a lug (220) protruding from

said shell and being arrangeable at a complementarily shaped
opening (221) formed on said second wing above an upper

perimetric edge (213) of said at least one quarter (204).
Ski boot according to any one or more of the
preceding claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a first

curved slot (322) is formed at a second wing (312) of a
first flap, its center of rotation being located

approximately at the axis of studs (303), said first slot
(322) forming a guiding element for the rotation of said

quarter (304), said quarter having an adapted lug (320a)
that is rigidly coupled to it, protrudes outward from it,

and slidingly engages a first slot (322), said lug limiting
the rotation of said quarter.
Ski boot according to claim 8, characterized in that
said second wing (312) of said first flap is connected to a

second flap (315) by means of a first bridge (314) located
at an upper perimetric edge of said quarter, by means of a

second bridge (318) located in a region (317) above the
malleoli, and by means of a third bridge (323) located in a 

median region with respect to said first and second bridges.
Ski boot according to claim 9, characterized in
that a second arched slot (324) is formed at said second

flap, its center of rotation being located approximately at
the axis of said stud (303), said second slot constituting a

guiding element for the rotation of said quarter, said
rotation being limited by the presence of a lug (320b) that

protrudes on the outside of said at least one quarter.
Ski boot according to claim 10, characterized in
that it is possible to interpose, in the gap between the

ends of said first and second slots and the respective lugs,
an element that is elastically deformable or has a

presettable rigidity, such as a block made of plastics,
which allows to vary the forward or backward flexing of said

quarter.
Ski boot according to claim 11, characterized in
that the variation in the inclination of said quarter can be

achieved by interposing, at said first and/or second and/or
third bridge and at the outer lateral surface of said

quarter, a spacer element that has the desired thickness.
