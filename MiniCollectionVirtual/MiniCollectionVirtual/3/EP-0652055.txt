<ABSTRACT>
A device for pre-treating electronic circuit scraps, 
said device comprising a conduit placed at a slope to the 

vertical direction, in which device some counter-rotating 
disk wheels are cascade arranged and bear grid-like vanes 

and begin from the upper end where the scraps are introduced, 
and go down to the lower end, which is the scrap 

outlet. The inlet and the outlet means for the scraps are 
made up of rotatable doors and of a loading opening as 

well as of a discharge conveyor respectively, with the 
interposition, according to a variant of this invention, 

of respective air barriers. The conduit is endowed with 
means for causing the heat-exchange fluid to circulate 

inside the same, from the lower end to the upper end. 
It is also a subject of this invention a process 
for pre-treating electronic circuit scraps, said process 

comprising the steps of:
 

   (I) carrying out the treatment in an oven made up 
of a device according to this invention; (II) carrying out 

the treatment of plastic materials and metals in a refrigerator 
consisting of a device according to this invention, 

as well as (III) burning the outlet air and (IV) burning 
the outlet heat-exchange fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of treatment of
electronic circuit scraps.More specifically, this invention relates to a
device for pre-treating electronic circuit scraps.This invention further refers to a process for pre-treating
electronic circuit scraps, that employs such kind
of device.By the term "pre-treating" it is meant in the present
disclosure a treatment suitable to allow a subsequent
recovery of their components, and particularly by which
metals contained in the electronic circuit scraps are not
already recovered, but these metals can be tansformed into
metal ions and then afterwards they can be recovered as
electrolytic metals in a successive process.Circuit electronic scraps, regardless of their
origin (computers, televisors, radio, telephonic systems,
etc.) have showed themselves, when discharged, as a danger
not to be disregarded for the environment wherein we live,
without speaking of the fact that enormous quantities of
metals which might become in time no longer available are
so irreparably lost.Therefore, the Applicant of the present application
has already previously suggested a device able to treat
such scraps so that it would be possible to recover metal
contained in them, disclosed in DE-A-40.18.607.Briefly, it provides an encounter in equicurrent of
the electronic circuit scraps with a heat-exchange fluid
at a high temperature for separating the various constituent 
components. It includes a heatable container provided
with a closable scrap charging opening and a closable
products removal opening. The container is formed as a
rotary tube with an inert heat exchange gas inlet and
removal conduit. The rotatable tubular container
includes means for circulating scrap introduced
thereinto, and means for heating the container itself
with the scrap introduced thereinto so as to break the
metal-plastics bond ans separate plastics parts from
metal parts.However, such a device has two fundamental
drawbacks.First, by means of it the quantity of
unrecovered metal is considerable, that is to say, the
efficiency of the device is poor.Second, during its operation at high
temperature there is no safety against leakages from it
of polluting gases into the atmosphere, some of which,
even if in very small quantities, are extremely
dangerous, such as for instance dioxines, bromine
vapours, mercury vapours, phenols, and the like. It is the object of this invention to provide a
device for pre-treating electronic circuit scraps suitable
to allow a subsequent substantially complete recovery Of
their
