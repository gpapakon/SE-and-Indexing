<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a non-naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule capable of blocking or interfering with a replicative intermediate of a virus, a virusoid, or a viroid. The nucleic acid molecule may contain a ribozyme or a plurality of ribozymes. Alternatively, the nucleic acid molecule may be an antisense nucleic acid molecule. The ribozyme may be a hairpin ribozyme, a hammerhead ribozyme, an RNAase P ribozyme, a minizyme, or other catalytic RNA molecule. The virus may be an animal, a mammalian, a plant, a fungal, a protozoan, a yeast, a bacterial virus, or a human virus. The nucleic acid molecule may be expressed in the cell or it may be preformed and administered (ex vivo). The present invention contemplates methods of controlling infection of a pathogenic infectious agent in a plant or animal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the control of
pathogens in plants and more particularly to the
control of viruses and viroids in transgenic plants.The ability to control plant pathogens has long been a
principal goal in agricultural research. In contemporary
research, there has been a focus on recombinant DNA
technology in the quest for developing disease-resistant
plants. However, despite the commercially devastating
effects of various diseases in, for example, crop plants,
little progress has been made in controlling viroid and
virus infection in plants. A viroid is a plant-pathogenic infectious agent comprising
a naked (i.e. non-protein associated) circular single
stranded RNA molecule. Most known viroids are similar in
structure and apparently rely solely on host cell enzymes
for replication. Replication is thought to occur in the
host cell nucleus where the RNA is associated with the
nucleolus. Infectious viroid RNA (+) is transcribed into an
oligomeric complementary RNA (-) several times the unit
length of the viroid (+) RNA. The (-) RNA oligomers
probably then serve as templates for the synthesis of (+)
RNA which is then cleaved into unit-length linear strands
followed by ligation to form single stranded infectious (+)
RNA molecules.The viroid class of plant pathogens are low molecular
weight, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules. They are
the smallest known autonomously replicating agents with a
size range between 246-375 nucleotides. The RNA has been
shown to have extensive intramolecular base-pairing giving
the viroids a rod-like structure (Sanger et al., 1976). The
result of the interaction of the viroids with the plant host
can range from no apparent or a mild associated host
phenotype to an extremely severe pathology. In many cases
the infection can lead to significant impairment of the
plant growth and fruiting causing economically important
disease. Although the pathology of viroid infections has
been well documented, there has been no report of the
identification of resistance genes or the design and
introduction of synthetic resistance genes into host plants.
A contributing factor to this is that details of the
mechanisms and onset of pathogenesis are not well
understood. As such, it is difficult to identify host gene
targets to breed for a resistant genotype. A potentially
useful approach to bypass this problem and to lead to the 
development of viroid-resistant cultivars is the application
of the concept of pathogen-derived resistance mechanisms
