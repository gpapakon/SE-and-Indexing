<ABSTRACT>
Drop-feed apparatus for dropping items (P1) into a 
container (C) comprises a duct (2) defining a path 

through which the items (P1) drop into the container (C), 
the tubular duct (2) having an outlet end (3) formed by 

cutting the tubular duct (2) in the general configuration 
of a recorder mouthpiece. The outlet has an associated 

pivoted flap (4) which, by selective disengagement from 
the outlet (3), enables the items (P1) to fall freely 

into the underlying container (C) while also operating a 
flexible tongue (6), previously introduced into the 

container, which moves the items (P2, P3) which may 
already be present in the container (C) to one side, 

preventing their interference with the item (P1) which 
falls from the duct (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to drop-feed apparatus and
has been developed with particular concern for its
possible use for packing containers with small toys,
trinkets or the like intended to be inserted as surprises
in food products or the like.Specifically, the present invention relates to apparatus and a
method according to the preambles of Claims 1 and 9, which are known,
e.g. from FR-A-1 066 367. A substantially similar arrangement is known
from GB-A-904 668. A solution has been known for many years in this field in
which the surprise is inserted in a container (usually
called a "little barrel") constituted by two cup-like
bodies which can be coupled together by engagement of
their open ends.Very often the surprise is of a type requiring assembly
and a sheet of assembly instructions and\or a sheet of
transfers to be applied to the surprise must be put into
the container as well as the component parts; usually
this sheet or sheets are rolled into a tube for insertion
in one of the cup-like bodies in contact with its inner
surface.In view of the high production rate of the products in
which the container must be inserted (especially in the
case of confectionery manufactured on an industrial
scale) and considering the need to keep the cost of the 
surprise as low as possible it is definitely desirable to
be able to fill and assemble the container automatically,
particularly as far as the following operations are
concerned:
picking up the component parts of the surprise in
order to put them into the container,inserting the components into the container (usually
into one of its cup-like constituent parts),
together with the sheet or sheets carrying the
assembly instructions and/or decorative transfers,
andassembling the container by coupling its two
constituent cup-like bodies.Until now, it has been practically impossible to
carry out the operations described above entirely
automatically. In order to ensure that the finished
product was reliable (especially to ensure that the
container contains all the parts of the surprise,
that the sheet or sheets are inserted and that the
container is securely closed), manufacturers were
therefore obliged to resort to manual packaging
which involved considerable problems of
organization, costs and, above all, of hygiene of
the finished product. The object of the present invention is to solve the
problem of the insertion of the parts or component
elements of the surprise in the container, the other
problems mentioned above being resolved by solutions
which form the

Drop-feed apparatus for dropping items (P1) into an
underlying container (C), including:


a tubular duct (2) defining a path through which the
items (P1) drop into the container (C), the

duct (2) having an outlet opening (3)
which, in use, overlies the underlying

container (C), and
closure means (4) associated with the lower
outlet (3) and movable between a closed

position, in which the closure means (4) close
the lower outlet (3), and an open position, in which the

closure means (4) disengage from the lower
outlet (3) to allow the items (P1) to fall

freely from the duct (2) into the underlying
container (C),
 
characterised in that it includes:
a tongue-shaped body (6) movable selectively
(7) between a rest position, in which the

tongue-shaped body (6) is disengaged from the
container (C), and at least one active position

in which the tongue-shaped body (6) projects
into the container (C), and
actuator means (4, 5) for selectively moving
the tongue-shaped body (6) held in the active

position in a substantially radial direction
between the opposite sides of the container (C)

whereby further items (P2, P3), which may
already be present in the container (C) are

moved by the tongue-shaped body (6) into a
position in which they do not interfere with 

the dropping of the items (P1) supplied from
the said duct (2).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the lower opening (3) is made by cutting the

duct (2) in the general configuration of a recorder
mouthpiece whereby

the cut open end (3) extends in a
plane at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the

duct (2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the closure means comprise a

flat pivoted flap (4).
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the closure means (4) are

generally elongate and cooperate with the outlet
openings (3) of a plurality of tubular ducts (2)

arranged in a row for supplying the items (P). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the tongue-shaped body (6) is generally

flexible whereby the substantially radial movement
is effected by the bending of the tongue-shaped body

(6) itself.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 5,
characterised in that the actuator means (4) are

actuated by the closure means (4).
Apparatus according to Claim 3 and Claim 6,
characterised in that the actuator means are
