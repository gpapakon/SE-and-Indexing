<ABSTRACT>
The calibre (1) of the watch case comprises a central body (10) to which is removably fixed a peripheral body (20). In order to reduce the weight of precious metal in the case and hence its price, the peripheral body includes a hollow (21) circuiting the calibre. A frame (25), made from a strong but cheap material, is arranged in the hollow (21), when the two bodies are separated from one another, in order to provide the case with adequate solidity.
