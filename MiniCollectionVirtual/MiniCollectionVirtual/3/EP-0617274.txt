<ABSTRACT>
A gas emission spectrometer and method for 
analyzing a continuously flowing gas stream using gas 

emission spectroscopy to measure low concentration 
levels of one or more gas/vapor impurities in the gas 

stream. Alternating power is applied to an electric 
discharge source to generate emissive radiation which 

is filtered into an optical signal at the emission 
wavelength of a preselected impurity gas. The optical 

signal is converted into an electrical signal which is 
selectively amplified within a narrow frequency range 

centered at substantially twice the excitation 
frequency of the alternating power source. The 

impurity concentration is measured from the amplified 
signal upon rectification.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas emission 
spectrometer and method for analyzing a gas stream to 
detect and quantify the concentration of one or more 
predetermined gaseous contaminants in a gas stream of 
mixed gases under continuous flow conditions and more 
particularly to an improved gas emission spectrometer 
and method for analyzing a gas stream to determine the 
concentration of one or more preselected gaseous 
contaminants at low concentration levels in the parts 
per billion range with high accuracy. An ultra high purity supply of inert gas, 
particularly argon, has become essential in the 
manufacture of large scale integrated circuits. 
Semiconductor manufacturers utilize commercial 
purifiers to remove impurities in the argon stream to 
less than 10 parts per billion (ppb). Some of the more 
important impurities removed by these purifiers include 
O2, H2O, CO, H2, CO2, CH4, and N2. Continuous monitoring 
of the inert gas stream under continuous flow 
conditions to assure that the gas stream purity 
continues to meet its stringent specifications is 
mandatory. With the exception of nitrogen, analytical 
instruments presently exist which are able to satisfy 
the required <10 ppb mimimum detection limit (MDL). 
Nitrogen is also the most likely impurity to "break 
through" the commercial purifier system and contaminate 
the high purity gas stream.  
 Currently the only method for continuous 
monitoring of nitrogen at low concentration levels in a 
high purity argon gas stream is emission spectroscopy. 
In emission spectroscopy the gases are excited in a 
gaseous discharge to produce optical emission lines 
characteristic of each gas in the gas stream. The 
emission line for nitrogen is then isolated and 
analyzed to measure its intensity in order to quantify 
its concentration. To date, this method is however 
limited to a minimum detection limit (MDL) for nitrogen 
in the range of 0.1-0.5ppm(100-500ppb). The conventional emission spectrometer employs a 
dielectric quartz tube having two electrodes extending 
therefrom to which an alternating electric field is 
applied at a high potential sufficient to cause an 
electric discharge. The gas sample is fed into the tube 
under continuous flow conditions and is excited by 
absorption of energy during the electric discharge. 
This results in the emission of radiant energy as the 
gas molecules drop from an elevated energy level to 
lower energy levels. The wavelengths of this emission 
are characteristic of the gas components excited by the 
absorptio
