<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radio set having an antenna and an earthing surface which is constructed at the base point of the antenna and is made of conductive material. In order to avoid users of portable radio sets being subject to health hazards resulting from electromagnetic radiation, the invention proposes that the earthing surface be constructed such that it extends essentially from the base point of the antenna to that side of the housing which faces the head of the user of the radio set while said radio set is in operation.
