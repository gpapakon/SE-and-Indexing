<ABSTRACT>
A swivel hook comprises a hook body (10) including a 
housing body (10a) having a housing chamber (24) which has a 

opening (24') facing toward a side thereof and a pair of 
overhangs (28, 28) formed in opposed inner surfaces of the 

housing chamber (24), a hook proper (14) provided on the 
housing body (10a), a latch member (17) mounted on the 

housing body (10a) and being movable into or out of 
engagement with the hook proper (14) and biasing means (18) 

mounted on the housing body (10a) for normally biasing the 
latch member (17) causing it to come into engagement with the 

hook proper (14); an annular link (12) having a connecting axle 
(20) provided on one side thereof, the connecting axle (20) 

having an enlarged head (22) formed on its distal end, the 
connecting axle (20) rotatably mounted in the housing chamber 

(24) through the opening (24') with the enlarged head (22) 
engaging the overhangs (28, 28); and a plug member (40) 

closing the opening (24'), thus confining the enlarged had (22) 
in the housing chamber (24) so that the connecting ring (12) is 

pivotally and retentively mounted on the hook body (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a swivel hook used for 
rucksacks, knapsacks, baggages, belts etc., and particularly to a 
swivel hook comprised of a hook body, a connecting ring 
pivotally mounted on one end of the hook body and a latch 
member mounted on the hook body and normally biased by a 
spring to engage the tip of the hook body for retaining another 
separate ring or something. One typical swivel hook of the conventional type is 
disclosed as in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 46-28823. 
The conventional swivel hook is comprised of a hook 
body and a connecting ring pivotally mounted on the hook 
body. The hook body and the connecting ring are made 
separately and later put together. The hook body is made of a 
metal plate and has a hook formed on the lower end and a 
small hook arrangement formed on the upper end. The upper 
hook arrangement is bifurcated to provide an elongated notch. 
A resilient plate is clamped to the end of the upper hook and is 
normally biased by its own resiliency to tend to close the hook. 
The connecting ring has a connecting axle provided centrally on 
one side thereof. The connecting axle has an enlarged spherical 
end formed on its lower end. The connecting axle is loosely 
fitted in the notch so that the connecting ring is able to rotate, 
mounted on the bifurcated upper hook arrangement of the 
hook body. A similar hook in shown in EP-A-0170811 in which the latch member is integral with the hook body. Another conventional type of swivel hook is disclosed as 
in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication Nos. 2-80212  
 
and 4-93508. Likewise, this conventional swivel hook 
comprises a hook body and a connecting ring pivotally 
mounted on the hook body. Instead of having a connecting 
axle, the connecting ring has a through hole centrally 
positioned on one side thereof. The hook body has a 
connecting axle integrally formed on the upper end thereof, 
and the connecting axle which, in turn, has an enlarged head on 
its upper end. The through hole is slightly greater in diameter 
than the enlarged head of the connecting axle, so that the 
latter can be fitted through the former. After the enlarged 
head of the connecting axle is fitted through the through hole 
of the connecting ring, that part of the connecting ring which 
surrounds the through hole is squeezed, thereby retaining the 
enlarged head of the connecting axle in the through hole, so 
that the hook body can be pivotally mounted on the connecting 
ring around the connecting axle. These

<CLAIMS>
A swivel hook comprising; a hook body (10) including a 
housing body (10a) having a housing chamber (24) which has a 

opening (24') facing toward a side thereof and a pair of 
overhangs (28, 28) formed on opposing inner surfaces of the 

housing chamber (24), a hook proper (14) provided on the 
housing body (10a), a latch member (17) mounted on the 

housing body (10a) and being movable into or out of 
engagement with the hook proper (14) and biasing means (18) 

mounted on the housing body (10a) for normally biasing the 
latch member (17) in the direction of coming into engagement 

with the hook proper (14); and an annular link (12) having a 
connecting axle (20) provided on one side thereof, the 

connecting axle (20) having an enlarged head (22) formed on 
its distal end, the connecting axle (20) rotatably mounted in the 

housing chamber (24) by insertion through the opening (24') with the 
enlarged head (22) engaging the overhangs (28, 28); and 

a plug 
member (40) closing the opening (24'), thus confining the 

enlarged head (22) in the housing chamber (24) so that the 
connecting ring (12) is pivotally and retentively mounted on 

the hook body (10). 
A swivel hook according to claim 1, the plug member 
(40) having a locking portion (44, 54') formed thereon, the 

housing body (10a) having a locking part (46, 56) formed in 
the housing chamber (24), a part of the plug member (40) 

underlying the enlarged head (22) of the connecting ring (12),  
 

the biasing means (18) acting between the latch member (16) 
and the plug member (40) so that the biasing means (18) 

biases the plug member (40) so as to bring the locking portion 
(44, 54') of the plug member (40) into engagement with the 

locking part (46, 56) of the housing chamber (24), and biases 
the enlarged head (22) against the overhangs (28, 28).
