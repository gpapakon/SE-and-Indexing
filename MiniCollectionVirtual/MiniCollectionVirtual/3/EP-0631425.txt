<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus comprises a plurality 
of decks for accommodating sheets, a feeder for feeding 

sheets from said decks, an image forming unit for 
forming an image on a sheet fed by said feeder, a 

detector for detecting thicknesses or colors of the 
sheets accommodated in said decks, an input unit for 

designating a desired thickness or color of the sheet, 
and a control unit for controlling said feed means to 

feed the sheet of the desired thickness or color from 
said decks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an image forming apparatus having
a sheet transport
for transporting a sheet of a specified
characteristic.The transport of a sheet of a specified size has
been implemented in the prior art. However, the
transport of a sheet of a specified thickness or tone
has not been implemented.In the past, an operator directly confirms the
thickness or the tone of the accommodated sheets to
determine which deck the desired sheet is accommodated
in.In the bookbinding such as the preparation of a
pamphlet by using an image forming apparatus or in the
preparation of a booklet having various sheets built
therein, a user may desire to print on a sheet having a
desired characteristic or reproduce on a sheet having
the same characteristic as that of an original document
sheet. In the past, for such needs, the user
previously selects a sheet of a substantially same
characteristic on which a reproduced image is to be
outputted and then the bookbinding or the preparation
of the booklet is performed manually or semiautomatically. 
An image forming apparatus which meets
the above needs and provides consistent production was
not present in the past.In an image forming apparatus which converts image
information of a facsimile apparatus or an electronic
filing system to an electrical signal for reading,
transmitting, receiving, image-outputting, storing and
processing it, the communication of information
including the characteristic of the sheet has not been
conducted.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an image forming apparatus which eliminates
the above problems and
which permits the
transport of a sheet of a thickness specified
by an operator.This object is achieved by the subject-matter of claims 1 and 4 respectively.Consequently, a sheet transport apparatus according to the present invention is able to detect a
characteristic of a document sheet and transports this
sheet corresponding to the detection result.
Such a sheet transport apparatus also permits the
designation of a thickness of a sheet to be
transported through a console unit. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be
apparent from the following description made in
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 shows a sectional view of a first
embodiment of an image forming apparatus,Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a sheet
thickness detector,Fig. 3 shows a plan view of a console panel,Fig. 4 shows a flow chart of the first embodiment,Fig. 5 shows a flow chart of the first embodiment,Fig. 6

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus comprising:

a plurality of accommodation means (100, 101) for
accommodating sheets with a different thickness, respectively;
feed means (21, 22, 25; 31, 32, 26) for feeding sheets from
said plurality of accommodation means (100, 101); and
image forming means (10) for forming an image on a sheet fed
by said feed means (21, 22, 25; 31, 32, 26);

   
characterized by
 further comprising

detection means (40, 51, 52, 41) for detecting thicknesses
of the sheets accommodated in said plurality of accommodation

means (100, 101);
input means (200) for designating a desired thickness of the

sheet; and
control means for controlling said feed means (21, 22, 35;
31, 32, 26) to feed the sheet of the desired thickness from said

plurality of accommodation means (100, 101) on the basis of a
designation from said input means (200) and a detection result

of said detection means (40, 41, 51, 52).
An image forming apparatus according to claim 1,

   
characterized in that

   said detection means (40, 41, 51, 52) includes a member (51)
which floats in accordance with the thickness of the sheet fed

from said plurality of accommodation means (100, 101) and
measurement means (52) for measuring a float distance of said

member (51).
An image forming apparatus according to claim 1,
 
   
characterized in that

   said control means invalidates the designation from said
input means when the thicknesses of the sheets of said

accommodation means (100, 101) detected by said detection means
are substantially equal.
An image forming apparatus comprising:

document sheet feed means (300) for feeding a document sheet
to an exposure position;
exposure means for exposing the document sheet fed by said
document sheet feed means;
a plurality of accommodation means (100, 101) for
accommodating sheets with a different thickness, respectively,
sheet feed means (21, 22, 25; 31, 32, 36) for feeding sheets
from said plurality of accommodation means (100, 101); and
image forming means (10) for forming an image of the
document sheet exposed by said exposure means on the sheet fed

by said sheet feed means (21, 22, 25; 31, 32, 36),

   
characterized by
 further comprising

first detection means (40, 41, 51, 52) for detecting
thicknesses of the sheets accommodated in said plurality of

accommodation means (100, 101);

feed means (21, 22, 25; 31, 32, 26),

   characterized in that said method comprises the steps of:

a) discriminating the thickness of the sheets
accommodated in the plurality of accommodation means;

and
b) on the basis of a sheet thickness selection instruction
by an operator and the sheet thickness discriminated in said

step a), determining from among the plurality of accommodation
means the accommodation means corresponding to the sheet

thickness selection instruction, and feeding the sheet from the
determined accommodation means.
