<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a 
process for forming a thermoplastic composition from 

carpet wherein a carpet sample are melt blended without 
separating the carpet into its component parts. The 

process of the present invention produces a 
thermoplastic composition useful as a substitute for 

virgin thermoplastics in a variety of applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method 
for producing a thermoplastic composition by melt 
blending carpet without separating it into its various 
components. More specifically, the present invention 
is directed to a method for producing a useful 
thermoplastic composition from used carpet as well as 
thermoplastic composition produced by the subject 
process. For many years, disposal of waste materials 
has been conducted in ways detrimental to the 
environment. It has been burned in massive 
incinerators thereby polluting the air. It has been 
dumped into the ocean thereby contaminating the water 
supply. It has been buried in landfills where it 
collects without decomposing for years. In recent times, individuals and corporations 
alike have expended significant effort on identifying 
environmentally responsible methods for disposing of 
waste products constructed from synthetic materials 
such as resins and plastics. One important direction 
taken along this line is the development of programs 
for collecting the synthetic materials for recycling 
and re-use in other products. Many useful products, including flooring 
materials, are currently manufactured from a number of 
different synthetic materials which have varying 
physical and chemical characteristics. For example, 
conventional nylon carpeting includes three primary 
components: a plurality of tufts formed from nylon, at 
least one backing formed from polyolefins such as  
 
polypropylene and an adhesive material of styrene-butadiene 
rubber (SBR) applied as a latex and typically 
filled with an inorganic filler such as calcium 
carbonate. These products present particularly 
difficult challenges to recycling efforts because of 
the varying chemical and physical characteristics of 
their individual components in their different forms. The success of attempts to recycle such 
multi-component products has been severely limited. 
For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,158,646 and 5,145,617 
disclose methods for reprocessing fiber-containing 
waste materials wherein the process results in a fiber-containing 
final product. These type of processes are 
restricted in utility to the limited application where 
composite (fiber/matrix) materials are useful. Still other processes focus on separating out 
the individual components. Specifically, efforts in 
reclaiming or recycling carpet materials, such as that 
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,028,159 and 5,169,870, 
involve separating the individual materials through 
various processing steps and
