<ABSTRACT>
A trocar assembly (1) comprises a cannula (2), a trocar (3) 
fitted in a lumen (24) of the cannula, a cannula-retaining member (5) 

having a through-hole (51) for inserting the cannula therein and 
being provided at a bottom thereof with an adhesive layer (52) for 

fixing the cannula in place on the skin of a patient. The 
cannula is adapted to be held in the retaining member (5) by 

engaging means between them to permit the cannula to move 
forward continuously or continually through the through-hole 

of the retaining member as well as to fix the cannula in a 
desired position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trocar assembly 
and, more particularly, to a trocar assembly suitable for use 
in laparoscopic intra-corporeal operations. In recent intra-corporeal surgeries, there have been 
used laparoscopic or endoscopic surgeries to avoid cutting the 
skin over wide ranges. Such laparoscopic surgeries are 
generally performed by piercing a Veress needle into the 
abdominal cavity of a patient in place, insufflating an 
insufflation gas (generally, carbon dioxide) into the 
abdominal cavity, removing the Veress needle from the 
abdominal cavity after the abdominal cavity has been insufflated 
sufficiently, introducing a trocar fitted with a rigid 
sheath with a diameter of 5 to 12 mm into the abdominal cavity 
through the same site of the puncture, and then introducing 
a laparoscope into the abdominal cavity through the sheath to 
perform an intra-corporeal operation. In such intra-corporeal 
operations, however, there is a fear that any internal organ 
in the abdominal cavity may be injured by a piercing edge of 
the trocar during inserting it into the abdominal cavity.  To solve such a problem, it has been proposed to 
provide a protective sleeve on the trocar so as to cover a 
piercing edge of the trocar or to receive the trocar when the 
piercing edge of the trocar has passed through the peritoneum. 
Such a trocar fitted with the protective sleeve is adapted to 
penetrate the abdominal wall or peritoneum by pushing it in 
its longitudinal direction, and the protective sleeve serving 
as a safety mechanism of the trocar is so designed as to 
perform its function to cover the piercing edge of the trocar 
just when the piercing edge of the trocar is completely 
introduced into the abdominal cavity. During insertion, the trocar is advanced by the 
external force applied thereto in the direction facing to the 
internal organs, notwithstanding the piercing edge of the 
trocar has been protruded from the protective sleeve. Thus, 
it is difficult to prevent the internal organ completely from 
being injured by the piercing edge of the trocar even though 
the abdominal wall (peritoneum) has been spaced from the 
internal organs by insufflation. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a trocar assembly for use in laparoscopic intra-corporeal 
operations, which is free from a fear of injures to 
internal organs and is capable of being introduced into the 
abdominal cavity safely.  According to the present invention there is provided 
a trocar assembly comprising a

<CLAIMS>
A trocar assembly comprising a cannula, a trocar 
fitted in a lumen of the cannula, and a cannula-retaining 

member having a through-hole for inserting the cannula therein 
and being provided at a bottom thereof with an adhesive layer 

for fixing the cannula in place on the skin of a patient, said 
cannula and the retaining member each having means for 

engagement with one another, said engaging means permitting 
the cannula to move forward continuously or continually 

through said through-hole of the retaining member as well as 
to fix the cannula in a desired position. 
The trocar assembly according to claim 1 wherein 
the engaging means is composed of an external thread winding 

round the outside of the cannula, and an internal thread 
winding round the through-hole of the cannula-retaining 

member. 
The trocar assembly according to claim 1 or 2 wherein 
the trocar assembly further includes a sheath for rotatably 

holding the trocar, said sheath being fitted in the cannula 
so as to be rotated or moved along with the cannula. 
The trocar assembly according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein 
the cannula is fitted with a trocar-retaining member at its 

proximal end to permit forward movement of the trocar along 
with the cannula. 
The trocar assembly according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
the interengaging means is composed of annular ribs formed 

round the outside of the cannula and spaced from one another 
at certain intervals, and one or more projections extending 

from the inside of the through-hole of the cannula-retaining 
member toward the axis thereof, said one or more projections 

being located on an imaginary circle and circumferencially 
spaced from one another, said annular ribs each having one or 

more cuts corresponding to the number of the projections of 
the cannula-retaining member, said cuts being so located that 

one cut of the rib being not aligned with the cut of the 
neighboring two ribs so as to permit continual movement of the 

cannula every when the cuts of the annular rib are aligned 
with the projections of the cannula-retaining member.
