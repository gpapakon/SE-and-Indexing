<ABSTRACT>
A colored resin, a colored molded resin member and a color 
filter dyed with at least one kind of the dis-azo dye 

represented by the following Formula [I]: 


wherein X represents a methyl group, an ethyl group or alkoxy 
group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; Y represents a hydrogen 

atom or methyl group; R¹ and R² independently represent a 
hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, alkoxy group or a halogen 

atom; Q and Q' represent a naphthol AS residue. 
These are good in color fastness to light, bleeding 
resistance, heat resistance, transparency, spectral property 

and durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transparent colored resin, a transparent colored
molded resin and a color filter dyed with a red dis-azo
dye having the triphenylmethane structure.To impart colors to thermoplastic resins, thermosetting
resins, color filters, etc., various pigments and dyes are
used according to respective uses and purposes.For example, organic pigments are often used for this
purpose, since they are excellent in color fastness to light
and heat resistance and offer a wide variety of colors and
many of brilliant colors.Oil-soluble dyes and disperse dyes are used to obtain
transparent glossy products, since they possess excellent
solubility in resin.With respect to colored resins and colored molded resins,
transparency is often demanded as well as color
fastness to light, bleeding resistance and resistance against
heat during molding or in other situations.Optical color filters needed for television cameras, liquid
crystal televisions, flat panel displays on computers, etc.,
must be good in spectral property and transparency.Examples of red dyes for optical filters include those
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.
278569/1989. EP-A 0490252 describes a magenta toner powder for developing electrostatic
images which comprises a resin and at least one kind of the dis-azo dye
represented by the formula [I] according to the present invention.DE-3220772 Al relates to a photoreceptor for electro-photography. The electro
photographic photoreceptor incorporates a disazo pigment suitable for use as a
charge generation material for the light-sensitive layer. A disazo pigment having
triphenylmethane structure is shown as a photoreceptor, i.e. OPC (organic
photoconductor), used for example in photosensitive drums in copying machines.JP-A-57090041 discloses polybutylene terephthalate compositions colored by an
azo dye or pigment.JP-A-55127175 discloses the preparation of antifogging products colored by an
azo type disperse dystuff.JP-A-61228044 discloses azo pigments as colorant for polyolefin.JP-A-02238439 discloses a color filter formed by dispersing pigments. Although color filters are often produced by dyeing a dyable
film of gelatin, casein, polyvinyl alcohol or the like on a
transparent resin or glass base plate with a dye having a
given spectral property by printing, sublimational transfer, 
etc., it is desirable to color the resin itself from the
viewpoint of durability.Of such conventional coloring agents, organic pigments often
fail to satisfy the requirement for
