<ABSTRACT>
An improved waveguide window (10) for use in high power waveguide 
applications. 

The window (10) preferably includes a thin sheet (12) of dielectric 
material 

having a first planar face (14), a second (16) face, and a support 
structure (18) attached 

to the first face (14) to provide mechanical support for the sheet 
(12). The support 

structure (18) preferably includes a plurality of parallel conductive 
support bars (20), 

each bar having an inner portion (22) attached to the first face 
(14) and an outer portion 

(24) extending away from the sheet (12), the outer portion (24) 
being tapered to 

minimize wave reflection. At least one bar (20) also has a channel 
(28) bored 

therethrough to allow a coolant to flow through the bar (20) to remove 
heat generated 

within the dielectric sheet (12). Together, the sheet (12) and the 
support structure (18) 

form a waveguide window (10) which may be used to environmentally 
separate one 

waveguide section (32) from another (34). The waveguide window 
(10) preserves the 

particular environments of each section (32, 34) while allowing 
electromagnetic waves to propagate through window (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electromagnetic waveguides and, more 
specifically, to a high power waveguide window for use in an electromagnetic waveguide. Waveguides are used on a regular basis as a means for facilitating the propagation 
of electromagnetic waves. Typical waveguides comprise a plurality of conductive 
walls which define an elongated open section through which electromagnetic waves can 
propagate. In normal waveguide applications, it is usually not necessary to install a 
window across the open section of the waveguide. However, in applications where a 
portion of the waveguide needs to be in a vacuum, or where a section needs to reside in 
a pressurized environment, a window is installed across the open section of the 
waveguide to preserve the vacuum or the pressurized environment, and yet allow the 
lectromagnetic waves to propagate through the window along the longitudinal axis of 
the waveguide. A typical prior art waveguide window is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
4,286,240, wherein the window comprises two dielectric plates 18 (Fig. 1) placed 
across the open section of the waveguide 10, orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 12. 
The plates 18 allow electromagnetic waves to propagate through but keep the two 
halves of the waveguide environmentally separate. The two plates 18 are placed in 
parallel with each other and are separated by a gap 60. Cooling liquid is pumped 
through gap 60 to remove from the plates 18 any heat generated by electromagnetic  
 
waves propagating through the plates 18. The window described in U.S. Patent 
4,286,240 performs adequately in some applications, but for very high power 
applications in which both the frequency and the power of the electromagnetic waves 
are high, this prior art window fails to provide satisfactory results. For high power applications, a large window cross-section is required to prevent 
electric breakdown and to maintain power dissipation at a sufficiently low level so 
that heat generated in the window may be dissipated by some cooling means. As the 
window cross-section is increased, the thickness of the window must also be increased 
if the window is to withstand the mechanical forces imposed by the coolant flow and 
the vacuum/pressure environments. Increasing thickness, however, causes the fraction 
of wave power lost in the window to increase, and this, in turn, requires that the 
coolant pressure and flow rate be increased to carry away the additional heat. This 
increased flow rate imposes greater stress on the
