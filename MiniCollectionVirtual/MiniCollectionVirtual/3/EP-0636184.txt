<ABSTRACT>
Viable microvessel endothelial cells are isolated from tissue in high yield by enzymatic digestion of tissue containing the cells using as a medium for the digestion, an enzyme composition in a physiologically acceptable aqueous electrolyte solution of pH 6.5 to pH 8.0 consisting essentially of sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, acetate, and gluconate ions, and having an osmolarity of about 270 mOsmol/L to 310 mOsmol/L. The electrolyte solution when mixed with a blood component is effective for stabilizing viable animal cells for periods of up to 4 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
isolation and stabilization of animal cells. In one of its
more particular aspects this invention relates to the use
of such cells in surgical procedures.Living animal cells find extensive use in surgical
procedures. Such cells are used, for example, in organ
transplant surgery, in the providing of artificial organs
and members, and in vascular graft surgery. A wide variety
of animal cell types have been utilized in various surgical
procedures. Illustrative of the cell types which have been
used are hepatocytes, pancreatic islets, adipocytes,
endothelial cells, and myocytes. Cells of the foregoing
types and other types of cells typically have been isolated
from blood vessels, organs and other animal tissues.In the case of vascular grafts, particularly synthetic
vascular grafts, viable microvessel endothelial cells are
used to prevent thrombosis. Thrombosis in the vascular
graft, a serious problem encountered in surgery, can be
prevented by coating a layer of viable microvessel
endothelial cells inside a synthetic or natural graft.Microvessel endothelial cells are available from a
variety of sources. One widely used source is fatty tissue
from which microvessel endothelial cells can be isolated by
means of various techniques. Isolation can be achieved
mechanically, chemically or enzymatically. For example,
dissociation or digestion of fatty tissue can be
accomplished by the use of proteolytic enzymes.
Collagenase, dispase, trypsin, elastase, papain,
chymopapain, pronase, hyaluronidase and combinations
thereof are particularly useful for dissociating the
complex mixtures of proteins, glycoproteins, lipids,
glycolipids and mucopolysaccharides found in connective 
tissue. The major proteins present in animal tissue form
a matrix for holding cells together. These proteins
include collagen, elastin and fibronectin, which are
interwoven in a hydrated gel formed by a network of
glycosaminoglycan chains.Enzymatic means have been widely used to digest animal
tissues in order that the desired cells can be isolated
from the tissue and used, for example, in vascular grafts.
Other frequently used means for isolating cells from tissue
include mechanical means, such as cutting, mincing,
shearing, sieving or scratching adherent cells from the
tissue with a rubber policeman, and chemical means, such as
divalent ion deprivation or the use of chelating agents.Recently, it has been found convenient of use various
enzymes in procedures involving the dissociation of fatty
tissue
