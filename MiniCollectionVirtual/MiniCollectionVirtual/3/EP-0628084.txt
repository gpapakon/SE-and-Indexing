<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: Monoclonal antibodies and anti- idiotypic antibodies to Hepatitis C virus.The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with hepatitis C viral antigens, cell lines secreting said antibodies, an immunodiagnostic reagent comprising the antibodies, and a method and test- kit for the detection of HCV.The present invention further relates to anti-idiotypic antibodies, cell lines secreting said anti-idiotypic antibodies, immunodiagnostic reagents comprising said anti-idiotypic antibodies and a test-kit for the detection of anti-HCV antibodies in a sample, using anti- idiotypic antibodies.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a 9.4-kb, single stranded polyadenylated RNA virus which has been recognized as one of the causative agents of NANB hepatitis (Non-A, Non-B) . It causes acute and chronic liver disease and is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma. It can be distinguished from other forms of viral-associated liver diseases, including those caused by known hepatitis viruses, i.e., hepatitis A virus (HAV) , hepatitis B virus (HBV) , and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) , as well as the hepatitis induced by cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Evidence based on hydrophobicity plots and seguence homologies suggests that HCV may be distantly related to the family Flaviviridae (Houσhton M. et al.r Hepatoloσv. 14:381. 1991). Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis was first identified in transfused individuals. Transmission from man to chimpanzee and serial 

 passage in chimpanzees provided evidence that Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis is due to a transmissible infectious agent or agents.Epidemiologic evidence is suggestive that three types of Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis exist: the water-borne epidemic type; the blood or needle associated type; and the sporadically occurring (community acguired) type. The viral genome of HCV encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3010 amino acids that undergoes extensive posttranslational processing. The viral structural region is located upstream from the nonstructural region and putatively includes a highly conserved 19-kDa nucleocapsid protein, and two extensively glycosylated envelope polypeptides, gp 33 (El) and gp72 (E2/NS1). Recent studies indicate that substantial sequence heterogeneity exists among virtually all HCV isolates in the N-terminal region of E2/NS1, suggesting that this region of the HCV envelope may be under strong immune selection. A variety of presumed nonstructural proteins are processed from the remainder of the HCV polyprotein, including a
