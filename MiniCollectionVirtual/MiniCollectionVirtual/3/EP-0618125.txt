<ABSTRACT>
The pivoting footstep is integral with a shaft (12) for pivoting on a fixed spindle, located parallel to the body bottom longeron and close to the latter; the shaft (12) is extended by a screw (15) engaging with a sliding nut (16) which is immobilised in terms of rotation and pushed in one direction by thrusters (12) and in the other by springs (23,24), the two driving devices (22;23,24) being housed in a casing (27) of slight thickness located on the outer face of the longeron beneath and in the vicinity of the footstep.

<CLAIMS>
Pivoting footstep for the door (4) of a railway vehicle, 
comprising a pivoting step (6) with at least two positions, 

i.e. a raised, concealed position retracted with respect to 
the form, and a horizontal position of use,
 
characterised in that the step (6) is integral with a shaft 

(12) pivoting on a fixed axis, disposed parallel to the 
longitudinal base member (2) of the casing and close to the 

latter, said shaft (12) being extended longitudinally by a 
threaded portion (15) engaging with a nut (16) which is 

secured against rotation, and sliding longitudinally, said 
nut (16) receiving its longitudinal movement, in the 

direction leading to lowering of the step, from a first 
motive means (22) disposed longitudinally, and in the other 

direction from a second motive means (23, 24) likewise 
disposed longitudinally, the two motive means (22; 23, 24) 

being housed in a casing (27) of small width disposed on the 
external surface of the longitudinal base member (2), 

beneath and in the vicinity of the footstep. 
Footstep according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
first motive means (22) comprises at least one pneumatic 

jack.  
 
Footstep according to any one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the second motive means comprises at 

least one pneumatic jack. 
Footstep according to any one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the second motive means comprises a 

mechanical return means (23, 24). 
Footstep according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
return means is a compressive spring device (23, 24). 
Footstep according to any one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the first and the second motive means 

comprise the same, double-acting jack. 
Footstep according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the threaded portion (15) comprises 

helical ribs with a low pitch angle.
