<ABSTRACT>
The known flow control valve of the type that a 
bypass valve section opens when a main valve section has 

approached a closed state, is improved so that a bypass 
start point can be easily varied and adjusted even after 

installation of the flow control valve and that cavitations 
may not be generated in the valve. The improved flow 

control valve comprises a cylindrical body 91 having a 
bypass valve seat 92 mounted and having a plurality of 

protrusions 91a on its inner peripheral surface to form 
bypass
 flow passages 91c therebetween; a bypass 
opening/closing body 50 having a bypass valve element 51 

formed at its front end portion, having a plurality of slit 
holes 52b formed on its outer peripheral surface so as to 

open and close the bypass flow passages 91c between the 
respective protrusions 91a, and disposed in an axially 

movable manner; a piston 40 disposed in an axially movable 
manner, having an enlarged outer diameter section 4c formed 

in its rear portion, and having a communication hole 4a 
penetrating therethrough in the axial direction; an 

adjusting member 60 having a rear end portion of the piston 
40 fitted therein and formed in such manner that a 

resistance may be applied to a flow of fluid into a control 
chamber 9c depending upon a fitting depth, and an adjusting 

bolt 65 for variably setting the position in the axial 
direction of the adjusting member 60.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flow control
valve adapted to maintain a minimum flow rate by bypassing
fluid for the purpose of preventing overheating or other
hazards of a pump when a flow rate is small.One example of a flow control valve in the prior
art is shown in Fig. 5. A valve box 10 opens at an inlet
1i, an outlet 1o and a bypass outlet 1b. Within the valve
box 10 is provided a main valve element 20 pressed against
a main valve seat 1s by means of a spring 30, and a bypass
opening/closing body 50 connected to the main valve element
20 is supported in an axially movable manner. In the bypass
opening/closing body 50 are formed a hollow space portion 5a
and an elongated hole 5c. When a demand flow rate on a load
side is large, a pressure of fluid entered through the inlet
1i into the valve box 10 pushes the main valve element 20
rightwards as viewed in Fig. 5 to open the main valve
element 20 from the main valve seat 1s, and thereby flows
out from the outlet 1o to the load through a gap clearance
formed around the main valve body 20. At this time, the
bypass opening/closing body 50 moves rightwards as viewed in 
Fig. 5 jointly with the main valve element 20, and the
elongated hole 5c is held at the position where it comes
into contact with an inner surface of a guide member 19.
Hence, the fluid entered into the hollow space portion 5a
has no path for communicating with the bypass outlet 1b, and
a bypass flow rate is nearly zero. If the load flow rate
has reduced, since the main valve element 20 approaches to
the main valve seat 1s as pushed leftwards in Fig. 5 by the
spring 30, the bypass opening/closing body 50 also moves
leftwards jointly with the main valve element 20 and the
elongated hole 5c comes to the position where it
communicates with the bypass outlet 1b, the fluid entered
through the inlet 1i flows from the hollow space portion 5a
through the elongated hole 5c and escapes from the bypass
outlet 1b. This bypass flow rate is preset as shown in Fig.
6(B) so that a minimum flow rate can be maintained for the
purpose of preventing overheating or other hazards of a pump
when a flow rate is small.However, in the case of the above-described flow
control valve in the prior art, depending upon the position
of the main valve element 20, the position of the bypass
opening/closing body 50 is determined, and hence a bypass
flow rate is also definitely decided. Accordingly, in the
event that it is desired to change a bypass start point and
the like after this heretofore known flow control valve
