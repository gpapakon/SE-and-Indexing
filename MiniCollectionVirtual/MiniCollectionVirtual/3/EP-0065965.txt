<DESCRIPTION>
 METALRECOVERYPROCESSANDDROSSCOLLECTIONRECEPTACLETECHNICAL FIS DThis invention relates to an improved method and appratus for recovery of etal, particularly aluminum, from dross which has been skimmed from a reverberatory or electric furnace.BACKGROUND ARTAluminum dross is a combination of aluminum metal, various oxides, nitrates and carbides and constitutes a by-product of an aluminum melting operation. Generally the dross floats on the top of- the molten aluminum metal in the furnace. The dross can contain anywhere from 30% to 90% aluminum depending upon the particular processing technique and type of furnace. Dross, therefore, in an aluminum melting operation includes a significant amount of aluminum metal which is considered a valuable resource and which desirably must be recovered.Heretofore a typical dross recovery system for aluminum melting called for spreading and cooling the dross on a floor surface such as an aluminum floor surface. Because this cooling process is rather slow, a great deal of the aluminum metal in the dross is lost due to a thermite reaction, i.e., -.exothermic oxidation of aluminum metal. Typically 2% of the aluminum metal is lost for each minute of cooling. Thus, a dross which initially has about 70% aluminum metal will decrease to about 40% to 60% aluminum metal after cooling because of losses due to a thermite reaction.To separate the aluminum from cooled and solidified dross, one must next crush and break the dross into an 

 aggregate. The aggregate is then further broken down in a conventional ball mill. At each of these stages a certain amount of the' aluminum is lost as dust. Ultimately the dross concentrate is processed in a conventional rotary salt furnace which permits the aluminum metal to separate from the remaining dross material. Further metal losses are observed as a result of the furnace operation due to additional thermite reaction. Also there is loss due to formation of slag or dross in the salt furnace. Ultimately the recovery of aluminum by this process is on the order of 40% to 50% of the original aluminum metal in the dross. Consequently a method and mechanism for improving the recovery of aluminum metal as well as other metals from their dross will have a significant commercial and conservation impact.A technique for recovery of zinc metal from a dross concentrate is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,057,232. This patent discloses a method . for separating molten zinc from dross by use of a press mechanism which compresses the dross in a ladle and

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. An improved method for recovery of metal from a metal bearing dross comprising the steps of:
(a)
'
 collecting the dross in a* receptacle of the type having at least one trough with at least one downwardly and inwardly inclined side wall having metal flow passages through the wall;
(b) collecting the metal which decants through the passages; and
(c) cooling and mechanically compressing the dross in the receptacle by applying σompressive force on the dross and against the inclined wall to further decant the metal from the dross and to simultaneously cause migration of the metal to the outside surface of the compressed dross and to cut off 
'
 oxygen supply to thermite reaction.,
2. The method of Claim 1 including- the step of solidifying the dross with pools of solidified metal adjacent the edges and surfaces of the solidified dross.
3. The method of Claim 2 including the step of mechanically breaking the solidified dross and separating the metal containing portions from oxide portions by screening.
4. The method of Claim 1 including maintaining vertical passages in the side wall.
5. The method of Claim 1 including maintaining passages in the side wall having a diameter in the range of 1.2 cm to 6.4 cm.
6. The method of Claim 1 wherein said dross is an aluminum bearing dross. 


 7. The method of Claim 1 including maintaining a horizontal slot at the bottom of the trough.

9. The method of Claim 1 including maintaining opposed inclined side walls to form the trough.
10. The method of Claim 1 wherein the compression is maintained above a threshold pressure for metal migration and to seal off oxygen.

(h) melting substantially the remainder of the dross to thereby segregate a molten metal portion from 


 12. The method of Claim 11 including the additional step of separating oxide dust from the cooled, solidified dross.
13. The method of Claim 11 wherein melting the remainder dross includes the steps of:
(a) introducing a charge of solid dross to a melting pot adjacent a main furnace crucible;
(b) melting the dross in the pot; and (c) pumping the melted dross into the lower portion of the crucible for segregation into a molten metal lower layer and a dross upper layer.
14. The method of Claim 11 including the step of introducing an inert gas mixture to the molten material to enhance separation of oxide from the molten metal.
