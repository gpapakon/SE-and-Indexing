<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nitrogen oxide 
detecting sensor and a method of manufacturing the 
sensor and more particularly to a nitrogen oxygen 
sensor to be used in the art of reducing or 
decomposing nitrogen oxide and a method of 
manufacturing such sensor. As the conventional methods of measuring a 
concentration of nitrogen oxide in exhaust gas, there 
are known the chemiluminescence method, infrared 
absorbing analysis method, ultraviolet ray absorbing 
analysis method, controlled potential electrolysis 
method and controlled potential coulomb method. Further, in recent years, there is a growing 
scientific interest to employ, as an oxide 
semiconductor sensor, a compound expressed by;

 YBa₂ Cu₃ O₇ - δ


 
   At present, the chemiluminescence method is 
considered as the most promising of all for its 
highest measurement precision and reliability. 
However, this method requires such components as an 
ozone generator, a photomultiplier tube, and a high 
voltage source. Thus, this method suffers the 
limitations in the possibility of system size 
reduction, cost reduction and maintenance conditions. When a high detection precision is not needed, 
the controlled potential electrolysis method is 
convenient. This method, however, suffers the 
problems of secular change of the electrodes and 
maintenance of electrolysis solution. Moreover, the devices employed by these methods 
cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Also, while 
the measurement precisions are high, the methods 
require calibration due to occurrence of drift and the 
devices employed have the problem of durability. On the other hand, the above-described oxide 
semiconductor sensor has the problem that its 
sensitivity characteristics are subject to change if 
water is present in the detection environment. Accordingly, the primary object of the present 
invention is to provide a nitrogen oxide sensor which  
 
is simple in its construction and which is economical 
and durable and to provide also a method of 
manufacturing such sensor. For accomplishing the above-noted object, a 
nitrogen oxide detecting sensor, according to the 
present invention, comprises:
 
   a gas detecting portion composed mainly of an 
oxide compound having electric conductivity or 
semiconductivity, said oxide compound having a crystal 
structure of 2212 phase and expressed generally as:

Bi₂ Sr₂ (Ca 1-X YX) Cu₂ O₈ ± δ


 
   (where, X is more than 0 but not more than 1 
excluding 1, δ is more than 0 but less than 1 
including 1)
 
and
 
   electrodes
