<ABSTRACT>
A decoder decodes directionally encoded audio signals for reproduction via a loudspeaker layout over a listening area. The encoded signals are received at an input and decoded by matrix means. The signals are output in a form suitable for reproduction via the loudspeaker layout. The coefficients of the decoding matrix are such that at a predetermined listening position in the listening area, the reproduced velocity vector direction and the reproduced energy vector position directions are substantially equal to each other and substantially independent of frequency in a broad audio frequency range. The gain coefficients of the decoding matrix are such that the reproduced velocity vector magnitude rV of the decoded audio signal varies systematically with encoded sound direction at frequencies in the region of and above a predetermined middle audio frequency. In a preferred example, the decoder is an ambisonic decoder for handling, for example, B-format encoded signals. The decoder may be used in an audio-visual system, such as HDTV.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for
directionally encoding and reproducing sound, and
particularly, but not exclusively, to the technique known
as surround sound and to the provision of improved surround
sound decoders and reproduction systems using such
decoders.The present invention is applicable to a number of
different surround sound techniques, including Ambisonics,
and to other encoding techniques.Ambisonics was developed in the 1970's and early
1980's based on the idea of encoding information about a
360° directional surround-sound field within a limited
number of recording or transmission channels, and decoding
these through a frequency-dependent psychoacoustically
optimised decoder matrix. The matrix is adapted to the
specific arrangement of loudspeakers in the listening room,
so as to recreate through that specific layout the
directional effect originally intended. Examples of
Ambisonic systems are described and claimed in the earlier
British patents numbers 1494751, 1494752, 1550627 and
2073556, all assigned to National Research Development
Corporation. Ambisonic techniques are also described in a
number of published papers including the paper by M.A.
Gerzon, "Ambisonics in Multichannel Broadcasting and Video"
published at pp 859-871 of J Audio Eng. Soc., Vol. 33, No.
11, (1985 Nov.).While known Ambisonic systems have worked extremely
well, particularly in those cases where at least three
transmission channels are available, they do nonetheless,
in common with many other sound reproduction systems,
suffer some limitations particularly with respect to the
stability of front-stage images. This is a marked 
disadvantage in particular when it is desired to use
Ambisonics in an audiovisual system with TV, film or HDTV.
Then it is found that the stability of front-stage images
is not good enough to give a reasonable match in direction
between the audible and visual image across the whole
listening area.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a decoder for decoding directionally
encoded audio signals for reproduction via a loudspeaker
layout over a listening area, comprising:
an input for receiving the directionally encoded audio
signals;matrix means for modifying said audio signals; andan output for outputting the modified audio signal in
a form suitable for reproduction via the loudspeakers;the coefficients of said matrix means being such that
