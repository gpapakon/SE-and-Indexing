<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for transmitting a digital television signal using 
a 128 point constellation comprised of four 32 point quadrants which are each processed 

using the same coding techniques as the single 32 QAM ATRC "simulcast" system, in 
order, for example to provide a clear migration path to a higher data rate progressive 

scan system. At the receiver, the four 32 QAM quadrants of the 128 QAM constellation 
of the instant invention are each identically decoded. Additional data is also provided to 

choose which quadrant is to be processed. In this manner, receivers deployed at the 
start of HDTV broadcasting will be compatible with the future broadcast signal and will 

continue to process and display images.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a digital transmission system comprising a 
transmitter provided with a quadrature amplitude modulator for deriving a quadrature 
amplitude modulated signal using a first signal constellation from a digital signal, a 
channel for transmitting said quadrature amplitude modulated signal to at least one 
receiver, said receiver comprising a quadrature amplitude demodulator for deriving a 
demodulated digital signal from the received quadrature amplitude modulated signal. 
The invention is also related to a transmitter and a receiver for use in such a 
transmission system, and is further related to a transmission and receiving method. Such a transmission system and method are known from the article 
"ATRC's all-digital HDTV proposal, by L.W. Lockwood in Communications 
Technology, June 1991. The Federal Communications Commission and cable television testing 
organizations such as Cable Labs, have been evaluating digital television delivery 
systems in order to choose a new television "standard" which someday will replace 
NTSC in the United States. These systems all involve digital coding and data 
compression techniques, for example those utilizing the MPEG algorithm or variations 
thereof. MPEG is discussed in U.S. serial No. 774,006, filed October 8, 1991, and in 
ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG-2 Working Draft #3, July 16, 1993, both of which 
are incorporated by reference herein. Several systems, such as those demonstrated by the Advanced Television 
Research Consortium and the American Television Alliance, propose using quadrature 
amplitude modulation (QAM) or Vestigial Sideband (VSB) modulation techniques in the 
transmission of the coded television information. QAM has demonstrated robust 
performance during the tests conducted by the ATTC (Advanced Television Testing 
Committee).  The FCC plans to test and approve an HDTV standard for terrestrial 
broadcasting in 1994. Although the specifics of the standard are yet to be fully tested 
and agreed upon, the FCC has indicated that the system will initially take the form of a 
so called "simulcast" approach. The new HDTV signals will have to fit into currently 
unused television channels (so called "taboo" channels) and initially co-exist with 
conventional analog television signals without co-channel interference. NTSC will be used hereinafter to represent one example of conventional 
television broadcasting. Other examples would be SECAM and PAL. Although NTSC is 
exemplified herein, it is not meant to be construed as a
