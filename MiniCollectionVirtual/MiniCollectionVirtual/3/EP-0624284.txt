<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to semiconductor laser
amplifiers. More particularly, the invention
pertains to semiconductor laser amplifiers having
tapered amplification regions.Semiconductor laser oscillators (i.e., laser
light sources, hereinafter lasers) and semiconductor
laser amplifiers (i.e., hereinafter amplifiers) were
first developed in the 1960s. Such laser oscillators
and amplifiers offered the obvious advantage of
extremely small size over the other types of lasers.
(A typical semiconductor amplifier may be on the
order of few hundred micrometers long). These first
semiconductor lasers were fabricated of a single type
of semiconductor.A modern semiconductor laser oscillator or
amplifier typically comprises a semiconductor
heterostructure, that is, it is made from more than
one semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide
(GaAs) and aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs). A modern semiconductor laser oscillator or
amplifier typically comprises a semiconductor
heterostructure, that is, it is made from more than
one semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide
(GaAs) and aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs).
Semiconductor oscillators and amplifiers are made
from a combination of semiconductor materials which
have different bandgap energies in order to achieve
electrical current confinement as well as different
optical indices of refraction in order to achieve
optical confinement.An exemplary double heterostructure amplifier 10
of the prior art is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 and
comprises three layers of semiconductor material; 1)
a p-type material 12 with a relatively high bandgap,
such as AlGaAs, 2) an n-type material 14 with
relatively high bandgap, which may also be AlGaAs,
and 3) a relatively low bandgap p-type material 16,
such as GaAs, sandwiched between the ocher two
layers. A metal contact 18 is placed in contact with
the top surface of the top layer, which may be either
the n-type or p-type high bandgap material. When
sufficient current is passed through the metal
contact, electrons and holes are injected into the
active region 16 from the high bandgap material
layers 12 and 14. These electrons and holes are
trapped in the potential well created by the low band
gap GaAs material. Since the electrons are trapped 
in the active region 16, they are forced to combine
with each other in the GaAs material . Light
introduced into this region will be amplified.Confinement of the light to the GaAs layer 16 is
provided by the wave guide properties of the
AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs material structure. The
