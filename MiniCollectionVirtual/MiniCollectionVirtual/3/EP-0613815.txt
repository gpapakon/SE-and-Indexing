<CLAIMS>
A craft characterized in that it comprises in 
combination a main float (11), an auxiliary float (14), a 

cross-piece forming an arm (16) articulated at each of its 
extremities with the said floats, respectively, a mast (18) 

interacting with the said cross-piece carrying a sail (19) and 
a means of controlled locking (24) of the articulation between 

the said cross-piece and the said main float, the sail (19) is 
mounted in a rigid structure (28) articulated on its upper part 

with the said mast, for example, by the agency of a yard or 
similar, interacting with the latter; in addition, the rigid 

structure is articulated on its lower part with an arm (32) 
itself articulated with the said cross-piece. 
A craft, as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the said rigid structure is fitted with transverse control ribs 

["wishbones"] (43,44,45). 
A craft, as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
it comprises a pod forming a seat (40) or similar, interacting 

with the mast cross-piece unit. 
A craft, as claimed in either of claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the said structure comprises upper 

control ribs (43), able to be worked by the arms and lower 
control ribs (44,45), able to be worked by the legs. 
A craft, as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the said means of controlled locking, consists of a brake, for 

example, actuated via a cable (50) by a lever (51) located in 
the vicinity of the said pod. 
A craft, as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the said auxiliary float is fitted with a 

means of automatic orientation, such as a spatulate rudder (25) 
or similar. 
A craft, as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the said arm cooperates with the lateral stops (34) interacting 

with the said cross-piece, to delimit a clearance stage of the 
lower part of the said structure.
