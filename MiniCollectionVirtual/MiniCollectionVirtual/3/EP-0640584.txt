<ABSTRACT>
A process for reducing the color of a polyamine 
product, comprising contacting the product at elevated 

temperature and pressure with a catalytically effective 
amount of a ruthenium on alumina hydrogenation catalyst in 

the presence of a hydrogen-containing atmosphere. The 
product may be further distilled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for decolorizing polyamines and 
more particularly relates, in one embodiment, to methods for decolorizing 
polyethylene polyamines using catalytic hydrogenation. In the various methods for making polyamines and mixtures thereof, 
often color bodies are formed which give the polyamine product an 
undesirable hue. Several processes have been proposed or used commercially 
for the removal of color bodies from mixed polyamine products. 
These processes encompass both physical and chemical methods. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,247 relates to a process for the 
reduction of the color of polyamines by reacting at elevated temperature 
and pressure the colored polyamines, e.g. triethylenetetramine (TETA) or 
tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, 
e.g. Raney nickel, palladium or ruthenium on carbon, and a hydrogen 
atmosphere for a period of time sufficient to effectuate the desired reduction 
in color. In this process, the polyamines can either be distilled into 
a narrow product composition and then hydrogenated or a crude polyamine 
product can be hydrogenated and then distilled to produce the 
desired product composition. A process for decolorizing polyethylene polyamines, such as TETA, 
and higher homologues, such as TEPA, by treatment with active carbon at 
elevated temperatures followed by distillation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 
3,723,529. U.S. Pat. No. 3,595,921 describes that the color content of the polyethylene 
polyamine products prepared by the reaction of ethylene dichloride 
with ammonia is reduced by refluxing the product in the presence of at 
least about 0.5 wt.% potassium hydroxide for at least one hour at a temperature 
of about 110째 to about 190째C. at the reduced pressure corresponding 
to the refluxing temperature. Polyethylene polyamine product having a  
 
substantially reduced color content is recovered from the refluxing 
mixture. A process for decolorizing discolored polyethylene polyamines by 
distilling the polyamines in the presence of polyethylene polyamine 
hydrochloride is described in British Patent 1,351,050. Similarly, U.S. Pat. 
No. 4,570,019 describes a process which may be run continuously for 
producing polyethylene polyamines having improved color characteristics 
which comprises treating discolored polyethylene polyamines with polyethylene 
polyamine hydrochloride in the presence of water at elevated 
temperatures for the time necessary to reduce the color of the polyethylene 
polyamines. The
