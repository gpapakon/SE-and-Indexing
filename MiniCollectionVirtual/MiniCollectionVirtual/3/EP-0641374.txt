<DESCRIPTION>
 ISO-OLEFIN PRODUCTIONThis invention relates to a process for increasing the selectivity of the production of isobutylene in an admixture of C 4. olefins.The present invention provides a process for producing an isoolefin with high selectivity, comprising: passing a feed comprising an aliphatic hydrocarbon containing from 5 to 20 carbon atoms in the vapor phase at a temperature up to 621°C (1150°F) over a first catalyst composition comprising ZSM-5, ZSM-12 or zeolite Y to produce a first composition comprising at least one normal-olefin of at least 4 carbon atoms in a first product stream, and contacting the normal-olefin with a second catalyst composition comprising a zeolite selected from the group consisting of ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-34, ZSM-35 and ZSM-48 under a second set of conditions which include a temperature within the range of from 371°C (700βF) to 621βC (1150°F). The four C. mono-olefins, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 2-methylpropene are collectively called butylenes. The term isobutylene is by established usage interchangeable with the nomenclature 2-methylpropene, while the other three isomers are n-butenes. Often they are treated collectively because the four mono-olefins are obtained as mixtures from natural gas and from petroleum refinery processes.Isobutylene is a desirable reactant for the production of alkylate, an oligomer of petroleum refinery C_-C. off gases, which includes high octane gasoline components, and for the production of 

 methyl-t-butyl ether when isobutylene is reacted with methanol. In a similar manner, isoamylene can be converted to t-amyl ether. A conventional process for the separation of isobutylene from the other three components involves sulfuric acid extraction or selective adsorption, as the isomers cannot be separated by simple extraction. Acid extraction is cumbersome and includes as an undesirable aspect the oligomerization of the components themselves. Figure 1 is a graph of the plot of the selectivity of the production to iso-olefin vs. conversion of n-butenes. The drawing illustrates the effect of the catalyst on iso-butene selectivity, of 1-butene conversion at 450'C and one atmosphere. The process of the invention comprises catalytic production of a C or a C.+ olefin mixture, including 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 2-methylpropene, in the gaseous phase, and contact of that mixture with a catalyst which will convert at least one of the members selected from the group consisting of 1-butene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene to
