<ABSTRACT>
An elongate superconductor is made by enclosing anisotropic particles that are superconducting or are capable of being converted to a superconducting form by subsequent treatment in a tube of a ductile metal, compacting it and reducing it in one or more reduction steps to an elongate tape. At least one of these reduction steps is effected by a rotary forging process, preferably one in which one of the platens is stationary at least in a rotational sense while the movable platen spins about a first axis that is inclined at a small angle alpha to the direction of the urging force while the first axis rotates about a second axis that is substantially coincident with the direction of the urging force to produce "wobble". The rotary forging operation may be incremental or quasi-continuous. Substantially better alignment of plate-like superconductive particles is achieved compared with conventional rolling processes, and higher critical-current density follows.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Manufacture of Elongate SuperconductorsThis invention relates to the manufacture of elongate superconductors from particles (especially ceramic particles) that are superconducting or can be made superconducting by an appropriate subsequent treatment. More particularly it relates to the manufacture of superconductors from particles which are plate-like or otherwise anisotropic and which need to be aligned to achieve improved critical-current density. An important application is to the "BiSCCO" range of high- temperature superconducting ceramics of nominal composition M2Sr2CaCu20g and M2Sr2Ca2Cu30,Q (where M is either Bi or Bi partly substituted by Pb) . These form as plate-like crystallites and it is known that spectacular increases in critical-current density can be achieved if the particles can be aligned to maximise face-to-face contacts between the particles. Another application is to the related Tl series superconductors of nominal compositions Tl«Ba CaCu«Oβ/ TlBa2Ca2Cu3Og and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu30.,Q.The simplest and potentially most satisfactory way of producing an elongate superconductor from superconducting particles is to fill a metal tube (in the case of ceramic particles usually of silver, because many other metals have a deleterious effect on superconducting properties of the particles and few other metals are sufficiently permeable to oxygen to allow the heat-treatment steps that are normally required after reduction) with particulate material and reduce the cross-section of the filled tube to compact the particles and lengthen the assembly. However, there is no viable way to introduce the particles into the tube in any but random alignment, and drawing and swaging processes of the kind used to reduce the cross-section of metal rods or the filled-tube preforms for mineral-insulated electric cables produce only a small degree of alignment.Substantially increased alignment can be achieved by first reducing by drawing or swaging sufficiently to form a 

 compact body without substantial voids and then further reducing by a series of rolling steps (with intermediate annealing as required) to produce a superconductor in tape form. A tape thickness below 50 micrometres is currently 5 recommended and is capable of achieving critical current densities (J 's) with good-quality BiSCCO materials in the region of lOGcAm.-2, but it has been established (by experiments using reducing techniques that are applicable only to short specimens) that better alignment could improve-j this figure at least tenfold.We

CLAIMS
1 A process for the manufacture of an elongate superconductor comprising enclosing anisotropic particles that are superconducting or are capable of being converted to a superconducting form by subsequent treatment in a tube of a ductile metal, compacting it and reducing it in one or more reduction steps to an elongate tape and is characterized by the fact that at least one of the said reduction steps is effected by a rotary forging operation.
2 A process as claimed in claim 1 in which the said rotary forging operation is one in which one of the platens
(the anvil ) is stationary at least in a rotational sense while the movable platen spins about a first axis that is inclined at a small angle alpha to the direction of the urging force while the first axis rotates about a second axis that is substantially coincident with the direction of the urging force to produce "wobble".
3 A process as claimed in claim 2 in which the said rotary forging operation uses a flat anvil and a moving platen that is conical with a semi-angle close to 90° minus alpha and a cone axis coinciding with the first said rotation axis.
4 A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which rotary forging operations are used for all the reduction steps. 5 A process as claimed in any one of claims 1-3 in which a rotary forging operation is used for all the reduction steps except for initial compacting.
6 A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which at least one heat-treatment step is used between and/or after reduction steps.
7 A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which in the, or each, rotary forging operation the platens disengage from the workpiece for part of their rotational cycle to allow the workpiece to be advanced a distance short compared with the length of the working zone. 


 8 A process as claimed in any one of claims 1-6 in which the force urging the platens together is repeatedly withdrawn or reduced to allow the workpiece to be advanced a distance short compared with the length of the working zone. 9 A process as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8 in which a quasi-continuous rotary forging operation is achieved by continuously applying a biassing force to the workpiece by pulling from downstream, pushing from upstream, or both.
10 A elongate superconductor made by the method claimed an any one of claims 1 - 9.
11 An elongate ceramic superconductor made by the method claimed in any one of claims 1-9.
12 An elongate BiSCCO superconductor with a critical
_2 current density m the range from about 60 to about 90GAm .
