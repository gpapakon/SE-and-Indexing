<ABSTRACT>
An improved voice communication feature is disclosed for an 
untethered personal stylus used with a digitizing display in a 

pen-based computer system. A microphone and speaker are 
included in an untethered stylus in conjunction with a 

mechanical contact and radiative pickup mechanisms, to enable 
multimedia communication between the user and the pen-based 

computer system, through a digitizing display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing 
systems and more particularly relates to improvements in 
input/output devices for pen-based computer systems. The following patents and patent applications are assigned to 
the IBM Corporation and are incorporated herein by reference. USP 4,686,332 entitled "Combined Finger Touch and Stylus 
Detection System for Use on the Viewing Surface on a Visual 
Display Device," by Evon C. Greanias, et al. USP 5,007,085 entitled "Remotely Sensed Personal Stylus," by 
Evon C. Greanias, et al. USP 5,117,071 entitled "Stylus Sensing System," by Evon C. 
Greanias, et al. Copending U. S. patent application serial number 07/778,431, 
filed October 16, 1991 entitled "Touch Overlay for Improved 
Touch Sensitivity," by Evon C. Greanias, et al. Copending U. S. patent application serial number 07/351,227, 
filed May 15, 1989 entitled "Flat Touch Screen Workpad for a 
Data Processing System," by Gordon W. Arbeitman, et al. Copending U. S. patent application serial number 07/969,864 
filed, October 30, 1992 entitled "Architecture for Communication  
 
of Remote Devices to a Digitizing Display" by Guy F. Verrier, et 
al. Pen-based computer systems have been described in the prior art, 
for example in the above referenced USP 4,686,332 by Greanias, 
et al. In that system, a touch overlay membrane is positioned 
over the viewing surface of a display device such as a computer 
monitor, for interacting with a pickup stylus. The pickup stylus 
described in the '332 patent is connected by means of a wire to 
the pen-based computer system. The pen-based computer system 
generates a radiative signal in the touch overlay. The 
radiative signal is picked up by the stylus and sent back over 
the wire to the pen-based computer. The computer then 
calculates the relative X-Y position of the stylus with respect 
to the overlay. The relative proximity Z of the stylus to the 
overlay is determined by the signal amplitude picked up by the 
stylus from the electromagnetic energy radiated from the 
overlay. An improvement in the stylus pickup antenna is 
described in the above cited USP 5,117,071 by Greanias, et l. 
In the '071 patent, the antenna configuration in the tip of the 
stylus is a small sphere, whose shape enables a uniform signal 
strength to be picked up without regard for the relative 
orientation of the stylus with respect to the planar surface of 
the overlay. A further improvement has been made to the stylus 
by eliminating the cable connection between the stylus and
