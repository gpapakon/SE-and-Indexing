<ABSTRACT>
Cleaning apparatus (12) for an imaging cylinder (10) 
in an ion deposition printer includes a housing (14) having 

an upper portion (16) and a lower portion (18), separated by 
an internal plate (22). The lower portion includes a plenum 

chamber (42) having an opening (40) at one end and a vacuum 
port (44) at an opposite end, and a scraper blade (24) 

mounted in the plenum chamber and having an edge engaging the 
imaging cylinder. A continuous cleaning web (54) is mounted 

in the upper portion (16) engaging the imaging cylinder 
downstream of the scraper blade. The cleaning web is 

impregnated with silicone oil. A related method includes the 
steps of (a) engaging the peripheral surface of the imaging 

cylinder with a scraper blade to remove toner particles 
therefrom; and (b) engaging the peripheral surface of the 

imaging cylinder downstream of the scraper blade with a 
continuous web impregnated with oil to remove residual toner 

particles and conductive powder deposits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to IDAX and MIDAX printing
techniques and specifically, to a cleaning apparatus and
method for an imaging cylinder utilized in such techniques.IDAX and MIDAX printing techniques are commercial
electrographic imaging processes that utilize what is
referred to as "silent electric discharge". In such
systems, an ion cartridge is mounted adjacent an imaging
drum. The drum then moves into contact with the transfer
sheet (for example, paper). Conventional cartridges
utilized in these printing systems include first and
second electrodes, typically called the drive and control
electrodes, separated by a solid dielectric member such as
a sheet of mica. The control electrode, typically in the
form of control fingers, defines an edge surface disposed
opposite the driver electrode to define a discharge region
at the junction of an edge surface in the solid dielectric
member. An alternating potential is applied between the
driver and control electrodes of sufficient magnitude to
induce charged particle producing electrical discharges in
the discharge region, and means are provided for applying
a charged particle extraction potential between the
control electrode and a further electrode, so that imaging
occurs on the imaging drum, or paper or like dielectric
moving past the ion cartridge. In most commercial
installations, a screen electrode is also provided between
the imaging drum and the control electrode, and separated
by an insulating spacer from the control electrode. A
commercial ion cartridge is typically constructed of a
plurality of driver, control, and screen electrode units,
in a matrix form. Conventional ion cartridges are 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,155,093; 4,160,257; 4,267,556; and
4,381,327.A toning station for supplying toner particles to the imaging cylinder
is also provided to create a visible counterpart of the latent electrostatic
image. Typically, a transfer roller is employed in rolling contact with the
imaging cylinder under high pressure to transfer and simultaneously fuse the
toner particles to a paper or other receptor sheet.Laboratory and in-plant tests indicate the need for improved cleaning
of the imaging cylinder and toner released to the paper within the print
engine, particularly when color toners are employed. The primary problem
relates to the presence of banded deposits around the imaging cylinder, the
composition of which includes conductive powder that is attached to the
toner particles to increase their electrical conductivity. This powder, a heavy
metal

Cleaning apparatus (12) for an imaging cylinder (10) in an ion
deposition printer wherein toner particles are supplied to the imaging

cylinder comprising:

a scraper blade (24) having an edge engaging the imaging
cylinder; and
a continuous cleaning web (54) engaging the imaging cylinder
downstream of the scraper blade, the cleaning web being impregnated

with silicone oil so that the cleaning web will apply a film of silicone
oil to said imaging cylinder to provide a release layer thereon which

facilitates transfer of the toner particles from the imaging surface to
a receptor sheet, characterised in that the scraper blade (24) is

mounted within a plenum chamber (42) connected to a vacuum
source (44).
The apparatus of Claim 1 characterised in that the continuous web is
drawn from a supply drum (46) and wound on a take-up roller (50),

and wherein an idler roller (48) is located between the supply drum
and take-up roller in the path of movement of the web, the idler roller

located to cause the continuous web to engage the imaging cylinder.
The apparatus of Claim 2 characterised in that said take-up roller is
driven by a motor (52) and including means for controlling the speed

of the take-up roller (50) as a function of the diameter of the take-up
roller and continuous web wound thereon, to drive the web at a

substantially constant speed.
The apparatus of Claim 3 characterised by a dancer bar (58)
