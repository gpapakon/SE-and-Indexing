<ABSTRACT>
A hollow injection moulding with undercuts on the inner surface is made with a tool having a core with at least two gps. of segments which slide on a spigot so that the moulded articles can be removed. The first step in removing the article (4) is a relative axial movement between the spigot (5) and all the segments. Next a predetermined gp. of segments (8) is moved radially. The remaining segments are then moved alternately axially and radially till all the segments have moved the required amt. in the axial and radial direction relative to the axis (6) of the spigot (5). Also claimed is an alternative first step of a relative axial movement between the spigot (5) and all the segments contg. an undercut. Also claimed is a similar procedure where the segments with an undercut are moved axially in a third step.
