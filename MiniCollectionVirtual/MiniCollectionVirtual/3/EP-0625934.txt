<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metallic composites and processes for 
preparing the same by explosion bonding. Conventional reaction vessels for manufacturing fluorocarbons are 
fabricated from one or more of Hastelloy, carbon steel, stainless steel or 
polychlorotrifluoroethylene resins. Commercial manufacture of a fluorocarbons 
creates an extremely corrosive environment. While the corrosion resistance of 
Hastelloy alloys containing nickel, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, etc., is superior 
to stainless steel, it also corrodes at an undesirable rate, particularly when exposed 
to a high perfluorinated catalyst concentration. The polychlorotrifluoroethylene 
resins and similar highly fluorinated resins are not suitable because such resins have 
relatively poor heat transfer, low strength, and faulty adhesion to supporting base 
metal surfaces. The conventional cost of materials for fabricating a reaction vessel on 
a commercial scale, from precious metals, i.e., noble metals such as ruthenium, 
osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold, is typically not 
cost-effective. High value metals such as rhenium, typically are also not cost-effective 
for use in fabricating a reaction vessel. Further, refractory metals, i.e., high 
melting point metals, such as hafnium, molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, osmium, 
iridium, and alloys thereof, are often brittle at room temperature which prevents 
these metals from being readily fabricated into a reaction vessel for manufacturing a 
fluorocarbon. While refractory metals have desirable properties such as corrosion 
resistance, high melting point, among others., these metals typically lack 
characteristics such as ductility which are required for materials used for fabricating 
a reaction vessel. Explosion bonding is conventionally used for obtaining a reaction 
vessel. However, conventional explosion bonding techniques are limited to using 
those metals possessing room temperature ductility and impact strength. Metals 
lacking such ductility tend to crack during explosion bonding.  
 Conventional explosion bonding techniques such as shown by US Patent No. 
3,281,930, also require multiple cladding shots in order to obtain (1) a clad or 
composite having more than one cladding plate on the same backer or base, and (2) a 
completely sealed and metallurgically bonded seam between adjacent clad plates on the 
same backer. Further, the dimensions of the resulting composite are typically limited 
to the dimensions of commercially available metal
