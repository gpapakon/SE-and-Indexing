<ABSTRACT>
A method of removing solvents from a 
detergent paste includes introducing a heated 

detergent paste into a channel of a dryer under 
pressure selected so as to avoid flashing of any of 

the components of the paste. At the inlet of the 
channel, the pressure is dropped, resulting in the 

flashing of selected components of the paste. As 
the paste advances through the channel heat is 

applied to the paste. Vapor liberated during the 
flashing acts as a motive force to convey the 

increasingly viscous paste along the channel. The 
resulting detergent concentrate is collected at an 

outlet of the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processes for
preparing concentrated detergents and in particular
the invention relates to processes for removing
solvents from detergent pastes.Detergent products contain surface active
ingredients (sometimes referred to as "detergent
actives"), which may be neutralized salts of acids
produced for example, by sulfating or sulfonating an
organic material. The process of making detergent
actives from the acid form is typically performed in
a solvent, such as water and/or alcohol. The
resulting detergent material may be a paste, a
solution or a slurry of various components. (The
term detergent "paste" as used throughout the
application is meant to include detergent solutions,
slurries and pastes). Final detergent products are
made from detergent pastes.One of the most common products, a laundry
powder, is prepared by drying a paste containing the
desirable detergent actives, other by-products,
various salts, detergent builders and from about 30
wt.% to about 80 wt.% water (most preferably from
about 30 wt% to about 45 wt.% water). The paste
ingredients must be compatible with each other and
insensitive to the drying process.A conventional method to produce a
detergent powder by removing water from a detergent 
paste involves spraying the detergent paste counter-currently
or co-currently with hot air in a spray-drying
tower This process most often yields a free-flowing,
low density (approximately 0.3 specific
gravity) granule.Since water removal in the spray-drying
process requires heating and exhausting large
amounts of air, the process tends to be energy
expensive. Some conventional spray-drying processes
also cause detergent actives and heat sensitive
builders to undergo physical and chemical
degradation because of the severe drying conditions
in certain areas of the spray-drying tower.Environmental concerns are another factor.
In conventional spray-drying, the exhaust gasses may
contain volatile organic material and particulates.
Pollution control measures are therefore required.
In some processes, when phosphate builders are
employed, over drying of the paste causes the
formation of undesired phosphorus compounds in the
product. This contributes to water pollution
problems.Other processes for producing detergent
powders do not utilize spray-drying. For example,
the acid form of a detergent active may be dry-neutralized
with finely granulated sodium carbonate.
Excess sodium carbonate and phosphorus compounds are
required for this process to facilitate the
absorption and

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing solvents from a detergent paste using a dryer having an inlet and at
least one channel, which process comprises:


(a) preheating the detergent paste to a temperature at which at least one of the
components of the paste would flash at the operating pressure of the inlet of the channel and

applying pressure to the paste to avoid vaporisation of any of the components of the
paste;
(b) pumping the detergent paste to the dryer inlet under a pressure sufficient to avoid
flashing of any of the components of the paste;
(c) introducing the paste into the channel at the operating pressure of the channel inlet;
(d) supplying heat to the paste in the channel and reducing the pressure along the channel
resulting in the flashing of at least one component of the paste wherein vapour

liberated during the flashing acts as a motive force to move the increasingly viscous
paste along the channel; and
(e) collecting the resulting detergent concentrate at an outlet of the channel.
The process according to claim 1
comprising preheating the detergent paste to a

temperature of between about 50°C and bout 160°C prior
to introducing the paste into the channel. 
The process according to claim 1
including injecting a vapor into the channel during

step (c).
The process according to claim 3 wherein
the vapor is steam.
The process according to claim 1 wherein
the detergent paste comprises water and alcohol and

wherein the temperature and pressure are selected
during step (d) to selectively remove alcohol from the

detergent paste.
The process according to claim 1 wherein
the detergent paste comprises water and alcohol and

wherein the temperature and pressure are selected
during step (d) to selectively remove alcohol and water

from the detergent paste.
The process according to claim 1 wherein
the dryer includes a plurality of channels and the

detergent paste is introduced into each of the channels
for processing according to steps (c) through (e).
