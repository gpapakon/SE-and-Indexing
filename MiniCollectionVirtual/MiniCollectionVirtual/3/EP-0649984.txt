<ABSTRACT>
A starter with an epicycle reduction gear having a 
one-way clutch within the casing thereof, which can shut off 

dust and filthy water, has a simplified structure, has a 
reduced number of parts and components, has reduced size and 

weight and has improved durability of the one-way clutch. Such 
a starter achieves these effects by housing the one-way clutch 

(7) within the casing (5) of the epicycle reduction gear. The 
one-way clutch (7) is housed within the casing (5) of the 

epicycle reduction gear, which includes a plurality of planetary 
gears (30). The one-way clutch (7) comprises a small-diameter 

cylindrical part (53) of the casing (5), serving as a 
clutch inner member, a small-diameter cylindrical part (44c) of 

the internal gear (44), serving as a clutch outer member, fit 
on the small-diameter cylindrical part (53) of the casing (5), 

a clutch roller (70) disposed between the small-diameter cylindrical 
part (53) of the casing (5) and the small-diameter 

cylindrical part (44c) of internal gear (44), and a spring 
(71). The internal gear (44) includes a large-diameter cylindrical 

part (44a) with an annular face. The one-way clutch (7) 
is formed so as to have a smaller diameter than the outside 

diameter of the large-diameter cylindrical part (44a) of the 
internal gear (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a starter
having an epicycle reduction gear. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a starter for starting an internal
combustion engine having an epicycle reduction gear.It is common for starters for internal combustion
engines to have a one-way clutch, which prevents driving of a
starter motor by the engine when the engine is started.
Normally, the one-way clutch is directly connected to a pinion
gear.Japanese Utility Model Publication Laid-Open No. 52-19528
discloses a starter equipped with an epicycle reduction
gear. In this document, the one-way clutch is disposed between
the outer periphery of an internal gear in the epicycle
reduction gear and the inner periphery of the casing encompassing
the epicycle reduction gear. Because the epicycle reduction
gear and the one-way clutch are integrally formed, the
one-way clutch is protected by the casing of the epicycle 
reduction gear from external dust and contaminated water, which
could otherwise cause problems to the one-way clutch. Therefore,
no additional sealing member, such as a casing and an O-ring,
is required to be provided to the one-way clutch. Such
a device provides a simplified structure.However, in this structure, the one-way clutch is also
disposed at the exterior edge of the internal gear, which needs
to have a large diameter in order to house an epicycle reduction
gear. Therefore, it is inevitable that the outside
diameter of the casing encompassing the one-way clutch, i.e.,
the external diameter of the epicycle reduction gear integrally
formed with the one-way clutch, is quite large. Such a
structural feature causes the following problems.The internal gear composes a clutch inner member, and
a clutch outer member, which are mounted on the outside of the
internal gear through a clutch roller. However, as the clutch
outer member is large in diameter, the total weight of the
system is increased.Recently, a starter has been proposed that includes a
starter motor that may be driven at high speeds and is then
decelerated by an epicycle reduction gear in order to reduce
the size and weight of the starter while simultaneously
increasing its torque. This type of high-speed starter motor
has been downsized in diameter so as to reduce the inertial
mass and increase the resistance to centrifugal force.
Accordingly, if a starter motor having a small diameter is
equipped with an epicycle reduction gear integrally formed with 
a one-way clutch having a large diameter, the portion of the
epicycle
