<ABSTRACT>
A damper for gearing driven by a step motor comprises a cylindrical surface (21) formed on one (16) of the gearwheels of the gearing, this structure being coaxial with the axis X of the wheel, at least one rubbing finger (36) emerging from a housing (38) integral with a plate (30) of the gearing, the end of this finger bearing, under the action of an elastic means such as a preloaded spring (34) housed at the bottom of the housing, against the cylindrical surface (21) perpendicularly to the axis X of the gearwheel. Conversely, the cylindrical surface may be formed on the plate, the housing with the rubbing finger then rotating with the gearwheel.

Damper for gearing driven by a stepping motor, the 
said damper being characterised in that it comprises: 


a cylindrical surface (21) arranged on one (16) of the 
toothed wheels of the gearing system, the said surface 

being coaxial with the axis X of the said wheel, 
at least one friction finger (36) emerging out of a 
housing (38) integral with one cheek (30) of the gearing 

system, the end of the said finger bearing against the 
cylindrical surface (21), perpendicularly to the axis X of 

the toothed wheel, under the action of an inner elastic 
means (34) in the housing, 
or conversely, the cylindrical surface (21) being 
arranged on the cheek (30), the housing (38) with the 

friction finger (36) turning with the toothed wheel. 
Damper according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
mouth (39) of the housing (38) is conical in the plane 

parallel to the plane of the toothed wheel, the cone having 
an angle at the top of less than 10 degrees. 
Damper according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
cylindrical surface (21) and the friction finger (35) are 

produced from, or coated with, a synthetic material having 
a pre-established coefficient of friction. 
Damper according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said damper is mounted on the 

last output wheel of the gearing system. 
Damper according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
elastic means is an inner spring (34) acting between the  

 
bottom of the housing (38) and the inner face of the finger 

(36). 
Damper according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
housing (38') is produced from an elastic synthetic 

material, such as an elastomer, and in that the depth of 
the housing is less than the depth of the finger (36'), so 

as to set up an elastic compression zone (40) level with 
the inner face of the finger (36'). 
Damper according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
housing (38') and the finger (36') are stepped, the depth 

of the outer chamber (39) of the housing being less than 
the depth of the outer head of the finger (37), so as to 

set up an elastic compression zone (40) level with the 
inner face of the head (37) of the finger (36'). 
Damper according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the cylindrical surface (21) is 

orientated, on the inside, towards the axis of the toothed 
wheel (16), and in that two friction fingers (36), which 

are driven out by the same central spring (34), emerge on 
either side of the same housing (38) which is situated on a 

diameter of the cylindrical surface, or in that two fingers 
each emerge from a pair of housings (38') which are made of 

elastic synthetic material and are aligned along a diameter 
of the cylindrical surface. 
Damper according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
inner cylindrical surface (21) is the inner surface of the 

wall of an inverted drum (20) which is fitted against the 
face of the toothed wheel (16), and in that the housing 

(38), or pair of aligned housings (38'), are held in the 
drum by a circular plate (32) fixed to the cheek and acting 

as a lid for the drum (20), or conversely, the drum is 
fitted against the cheek and the plate against the wheel.  

 
Damper according to claim 9, characterised in that the 
volume contained in the drum and closed by the plate is 

filled with a viscous liquid. 
Damper according to claims 3 and 9, characterised in 
that the friction finger is produced from polyacetate 

synthetic material, while the drum (20) is produced from 
synthetic material.
