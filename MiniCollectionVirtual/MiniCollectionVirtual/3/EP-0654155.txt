Device for controlling the transition of 
processor operating states from an instantaneous state 

to a follow-on state, 

having a state-storage device for storing a state 
code (Z0, Z1, Z2), 
having a data store which is subdivided into areas 
which are respectively associated with an 

instantaneous state (Z0, Z1, Z2) and consist of a 
plurality of partial areas which are respectively 

associated with an input vector (e0, e1 ... e6) 
and in which respectively a follow-on state code 

and control data are stored that are read out as a 
function of the respective instantaneous state and 

the current input vector, in which case the input 
vectors in the data store are the combinations of 

the input variables (E0 ... E3; E4 ... E7), which 
are preselectable for the instantaneous state, 

with the combinations of the input variables being 
preselectable for the respective instantaneous 

state, 
having an input device to which the current input 
variables (E0 ... E3; E4 ... E7) are fed and 

which from all the current incoming input 
variables (E0 ... E3; E4 ... E7) selects as the 

current input vector the input variables (E0 ... 
E3; E4 ... E7) which are preselected for the 

respective instantaneous state, 
having a selecting device (3, 6, 11) which on the 
basis of the current input vector and the 

instantaneous state reads out the partial area of 
the data store which is contained in the area 

associated with the instantaneous state and which 
is associated with the current input vector, 
 
characterised 


in that the data store (7) is subdivided into at  
 

least one first and one second group of store 
areas (7a, 7b, 7c; 7a', 7b', 7c'), 
in that the input device has at least two input 
stages (15, 15'), 
in that the state-storage device has at least two 
state registers (2, 2'), 
in that respectively one state register (2, 2'), 
one input stage (15, 15') and one group of store 

areas (7a, 7b, 7c; 7a', 7b', 7c') are associated 
with one processor, and 
in that there is provided a change-over device 
(30) which during the state transition of one 

processor effects a change-over between the input 
stages (15, 15'), the store area groups (7a, 7b, 

7c; 7a', 7b', 7c') and between the state 
registers (2, 2'). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised 


in that for the purposes of synchronizing the 
state transitions of the various processor 

operating states, a state code is only loaded into 
one of the two state registers (2, 2') if a 

certain state code is stored in the other state 
register (2, 2'). 
Programmable control having a device according 
to claim 1 or 2.
