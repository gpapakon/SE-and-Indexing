<ABSTRACT>
A filter cartridge 20 serving for dust separation has a cartridge body 1 which essentially comprises a support grid 2, a lower closed end part 9 and an upper end part 8 in which is provided a central outlet orifice 6. Furthermore, the filter cartridge 20 contains a filter medium surrounding the support grid 2 in the form of a pleated bellows 3 whose upper and lower ends are fixed dust-tightly to the two end parts 8, 9. The filter cartridge 20 is, moreover, designed in such a manner that the folds of the bellows 3 are tightly closed in the vicinity of the bottom of the cartridge body 1 and by this means form ridges 11 projecting radially outwards from the periphery of the bellows 3, which ridges surround in a ring shape, i. e. in the shape of a ridged ring 12, the lower end part 9 of the cartridge body 1 or at least an axial part-section 13 of this end part 9. In particular, the lower end part 9 is shaped at least in part conically, in the region of the apex of the cone, a valve 10 being arranged for the discharge of water. This design of the filter cartridge 20 gives it very good cleanability in the installed state using cleaning liquid both in the interior and in the external region of the cartridge body 1, especially "dead zones" of water being avoided in the interior of the filter cartridge.

<CLAIMS>
A filter cartridge (20) for dust separation with a
cartridge body (1) consisting of a support grid (2), a lower

closed end part (9) and an upper end part (8) with a central
outlet port (6), and with a filter medium surrounding the

support grid (2) in the form of a cylindrically disposed,
pleated accordion bellows (3) whose upper and lower ends are

fixed in dustproof fashion on the corresponding end parts (8
or 9), the folds of the accordion bellows (3) being formed by

mutual firm connection in the area of the lower end of the
accordion bellows (3) into a ring (12) of bars (11) which

protrude radially outward from the jacket of the accordion
bellows (3), and the bars (11) each being formed by interconnection

of two mutually associated legs (3', 3'') of the folds
of the accordion bellows (3), characterized in that the lower

end part (9) is of at least partly conical design in an axial
direction starting out from the lower end area of the cartridge

body (1), tapering in a direction pointing away from
the cartridge body (1), and the ring (12) surrounds the lower

conical end part (9) or at least a given axial portion (13)
of the lower conical end part (9).
The filter cartridge of claim 1, characterized in
that the lower end of the accordion bellows (3) is fixed and

sealed on the cartridge body (1) in the area of the ring (12)
by means of casting compound.
The filter cartridge of claim 2, characterized in
that the lower end of the accordion bellows (3) is fixed and

sealed at least with respect to the given axial portion (13)
of the lower end part (9).
The filter cartridge of any of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that a valve (10) is disposed in the area of an

apex of the conical lower end part (9).
The filter cartridge of any of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the upper end of the accordion bellows (3) is 

fixed and sealed in the upper end part (8) by means of casting
compound.
The filter cartridge of any of claims 2 to 5, characterized
in that the support grid (2) has a diameter which is

smaller than the diameter of the given axial portion (13) of
the lower end part (9) and is firmly connected, in particular

riveted or welded, with lower end part (9) in the area of the
inner circumference thereof, this connecting area being located

within the casting compound (4) which simultaneously
forms a mechanical connection between the support grid (2)

and the lower end of the accordion bellows (3) in the area of
the ring (12).
