<ABSTRACT>
A laminated plate structure including conduit and reagent 
delivery means for a fluid delivery system is provided to deliver 

precise volumes of a plurality of fluids in sequence to a treatment 
reservoir. Fluid channels are formed in the plate structure to provide 

a means for delivering fluids from a plurality of fluid reservoirs 
attached to the plate structure to one or a plurality of treatment 

reservoirs attached to the plate structure. Each fluid is delivered by a 
system comprising a fluid reservoir, an inlet valve in fluid 

communication with the fluid reservoir, a positive displacement pump 
in fluid communication with the inlet valve and an outlet valve in 

fluid communication with the positive displacement pump all of which 
are attached to the plate structure. The means for delivering fluid and 

the fluid reservoirs are positioned on opposing surfaces of the plate 
structure. The plate structure is provided with vent holes for venting 

vapors that may be produced during formation of the plate structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plate structure for use in fluid delivery 
system for delivering a plurality of fluids, in sequence to a treatment 
reservoir. Prior to the present invention, fluid delivery systems have 
been available which minimize intermixing of fluids while delivering 
a precise amount of a fluid for chemical reaction. These systems are 
generally utilized for chemical processes involving a large number of 
sequentially effected chemical reactions such as in peptide synthesis, 
DNA synthesis or when sequencing proteins. U.S. Patent 4,008,736 discloses a valve block containing a 
capillary formed of capillary segments bored at about 30° from a 
contact surface of the block. The junctions of the capillary segments 
are effected at the contact surface and within the block. The 
junctions at the contact surfaces form valving sites to which are 
engaged apertured sliding blocks which effect fluid communication 
with the capillary. While the sliding blocks are effective in providing 
the desired fluid flow, they wear too rapidly thereby causing 
undesirable leaks. U.S. Patent 4,168,724 discloses a similar device but replaces the 
slider valves with diaphragm valves. The fluid is delivered through 
the valves from a pressurized fluid storage source. This system 
requires a vacuum assist to open the valves. This system is 
undesirable because the type of diaphragm valve used is susceptible 
to particulate contamination. The pressure drop through the valves is 
difficult to control which causes less accurate reagent delivery.  U.S. Patent 4,558,845 discloses a fluid delivery system utilizing 
a valve block assembly comprising a separate block for each valve 
site. The common conduit to the reaction site is alternatively a 
channel in a block and tubing connecting two adjacent blocks. This 
arrangement requires a plurality of fittings which are subject to 
leaking. U.S. Patent 4,773,446 discloses a valve block assembly which 
utilizes diaphragm valves. The valves serve to control fluid flow from 
a plurality of pressurized fluid reservoirs, in sequence to a common 
outlet reservoir. This system requires the use of conduits from the 
fluid reservoirs and fittings to valve blocks for each conduit. These 
fittings are subject to leakage. The fluid delivery systems of the prior 
art depend upon the use of positive pressure to deliver the fluid and 
upon the control of back pressure to the fluid reservoir in order to 
precisely control the amount of fluid delivered to a treatment 
reservoir. These
