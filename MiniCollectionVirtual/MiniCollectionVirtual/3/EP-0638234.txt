<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes a trap for catching predators alive, which is designed in such a manner that it can be set after introduction into a passage. Moreover, the construction length is to be reduced considerably in comparison with known embodiments in order that the passage has to be cleaned only over a short distance. To this end, the trap is equipped with a half cone (2) which is mounted pivotably at the end of the trap body (1) facing the opening of the passage. The release linkage (3) is provided with a cam (14) which in the set position is engaged behind by a nose. As soon as the release linkage (3) is turned, the half cone (2) falls into the closed position. The half cone (2) is prevented from swivelling by the locking bolt which has dropped. The holding element for the closure element does not absolutely have to be a cam. Rather, instead of the cam, a permanent magnet can be used, which touches the closure element in the open position.
