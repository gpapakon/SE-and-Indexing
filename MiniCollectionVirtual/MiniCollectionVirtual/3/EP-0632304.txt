<ABSTRACT>
Two sections (16,18) of a binary optical element are perpendicularly 
or vertically offset 

relative to each other to induce a shift in phase from light beams 
(18,26) transmitted through the 

sections. An offset (d
offset
) of λ/2(n-1 ) will cause 
a Π shift in the phase between beams transmitted 

through the two sections of the binary optical element. An offset of 
λ/4(n-1) will cause a Π/2 shift 

in the phase between beams transmitted through the two sections of the 
binary optical element. The phase shift plate may be used for beam 

shaping.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a binary optical element, and, more particularly, to a binary 
optical element which will provide a phase shift between adjacent wavefronts 
of an incident light beam. Traditionally, phase shifting means have involved polarized light. A polarized beam of 
light passes perpendicularly through a parallel plate of crystal, the phase shifting means. The beam 
of light is divided into two cross-polarized component parts. The ordinary component or ray passes 
through the plate undeviated. The other component, the extraordinary ray, will emerge from the 
plate parallel to, but spatially displaced from, the emerging ordinary ray. At the appropriate 
thickness of the plate, there will be a difference in phase between the two rays. If the phase difference produced by the plate thickness for the two polarizations is Π/2, 
the plate is called a quarter-wave plate. A plate which introduces a phase difference of Π is called a 
half-wave plate. This prior art method of phase shifting light beams has several limitations. The incident 
light beam must be polarized. The incident light beam is divided into two component rays which are 
phase shifted from each other. The prior means does not introduce a difference in phase between 
two adjacent wavefronts of the incident light beam. It is an object of this invention to provide phase shift means for non-polarized light. It is another object of this invention to provide an optical element for phase shifting 
adjacent wavefronts of an incident light beam. In accordance with the present invention, at least two sections of a binary optical 
element are perpendicularly or vertically offset relative to each other to induce a shift in phase from 
light beams transmitted through the sections. An offset of λ / 2 (n-1) will cause a Π shift in the phase 
between beams transmitted through the two sections of the binary optical element. An offset of λ / 
4 (n-1) will cause a Π / 2 shift in the phase between beams transmitted through the two sections of the 
binary optical element.  Other objects and attainments together with a fuller understanding of the invention 
will become apparent and appreciated by referring to the following description and claims taken in 
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the cross-section side view of the phase shift binary 
optical element formed according to the present invention. Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of the cross-section side view of the fabrication of the
