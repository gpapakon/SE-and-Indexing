<ABSTRACT>
The stump pin device (14) for endosteal implants comprises a 
body (16) which 

can be expanded after insertion into the relative cavity (12) in the 
endosteal device (10). The expandability of the expandable body (16) is 

reversible so as to make the stump pin device removable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stump pin device for endosteal 
implants, ie a device enabling a prosthesis to be fixed to any 
endosteal device, which may be for example an endosteal screw or a 
fixing foot. As is known to the expert of the art, the law in many countries 
(such as the United States of America) requires that the stump pin 
be removable from an endosteal implant or fixture. To achieve 
this removability, all currently available devices comprise a 
threaded stump pin to be screwed into a female thread present in 
the endosteal device, and hence unscrewable to achieve the 
required removability of the stump pin. The main drawback of such known stump pins is that they are 
subject to accidental unscrewing. Recent research at an 
international level (T. Jemt, Quintessence International, 2/1992) 
on single implants shows that in 26% of the cases the stump pin 
suffered accidental unscrewing. Prismatic stump pins are also known, these being of considerable 
advantage both because they allow high positioning accuracy in the 
implant and because they can be formed of the most suitable metal 
for the particular prosthesis by casting, using a conventional 
calcinable substance (disposable wax). Notwithstanding said 
merits, prismatic stump pins have been abandoned because as the 
stump pin has to be cemented to fix it to the implant it is not 
removable. The object of the present invention is to provide a stump pin  
 
which although offering the advantages of prismatic stump pins is 
removable. This object is attained by the stump pin device of the present 
invention, which is characterised by comprising an expandable body 
insertable into the relative cavity in the endosteal device, the 
expandability of said body being reversible. Preferably said expandable body of the stump pin device is of 
overall tubular shape and is arranged to receive a screw element, 
the expansion of the tubular body being achieved by screwing the 
screw element. In this manner a stump pin resembling an expansion plug is formed, 
such that on screwing the screw element the stump pin becomes 
locked within the endosteal device, whereas on unscrewing the 
screw element the stump pin is released and can be extracted, so 
achieving the required removability of the stump pin. Said expandable body of the stump pin device of the present 
invention can be prismatic as in conventional prismatic stump 
pins, so presenting all the advantages thereof plus removability. Alternatively the expandable body can be provided with an external

<CLAIMS>
A stump pin device for endosteal implants, characterised 
by comprising an expandable body insertable into the relative 

cavity in the endosteal device, the expandability of said body 
being reversible. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the expandable 
body of the stump pin device is of overall tubular shape and is 

arranged to receive a screw element, the expansion of the tubular 
body being achieved by screwing the screw element. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the hole through 
the tubular body has a flared end portion, the tubular body 

comprising at least two radial slots extending through a certain 
distance from that end of the tubular body at which said flared 

portion is located, the screw element comprising a screw of length 
greater than the hole through the tubular body and a wedge-shaped 

nut screwable onto the screw and forcibly insertable into the 
flared portion of the tubular body. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cross-section 
through the expandable body is polygonal, the expandable body 

being conjugate with the relative cavity, also polygonal, in the 
endosteal device. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cross-section 
through the expandable body is circular, the outer lateral surface 

of said expandable body being threaded and screwable into the 
relative cavity in the endosteal device. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the expandable 

body is formed of calcinable material and then cast in a suitable 
metal.
