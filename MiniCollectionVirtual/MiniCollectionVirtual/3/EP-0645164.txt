<ABSTRACT>
The equipment comprises a respiratory mask (8) provided with a regulator intended to be connected to a pressurised respiratory gas source and a harness (10) having at least one extensible strap (16), the ends of which are connected to the mask and which comprises an element which can be inflated by the pressurised gas in order to extend the strap to a size which is sufficient to allow the user to engage the harness over the head and can be emptied in order to allow the strap to be tightened, to apply the mask against the face and to hold it in place. The harness (10) furthermore comprises an additional flexible strap (24), which exhibits little or no extensibility, provided with a fastener (26) which is tightened directly by hand.

Fast donning respiratory protection apparatus,
comprising a breathing mask (8) provided with a regulator

arranged for connection to a source of pressurized breathable
gas and a harness (10) having at least one stretchable strap

(16) having ends connected to the mask and including an element
which is inflatable by said pressurized gas to extend the strap

up to a size which is sufficient to permit fitting of the
harness on the head and is deflatable to enable the strap to

tighten, to bias the mask onto the face and to hold the mask in
position, characterized in that the harness (10) further

comprises a flexible additional strap, not or hardly extensible,
(24) having a fastener (26) for direct manual tightening.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that
the additional tightening strap comprises a band or strip in two

sections connected by the fastener (26) which is so constructed
as to be apt to be tightened upon a manual pulling on a free end

(30) of the additional strap.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said additional
strap (24) is connected to the stretchable strap or straps,

whereby it follows movements thereof.
Apparatus according to claim 3, whose harness has two
said stretchable straps forming a V from each point of

attachment on the mask, characterized in that the additional
strap is located between the two stretchable straps and

connected to the latter by cords or bands distributed around the
head.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it further comprises a chin strap. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it further comprises a higher band located

above the helmet, of a material which is not or hardly
stretchable, also provided with a fastener (40) for manual
