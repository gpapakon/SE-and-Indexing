<ABSTRACT>
An alkali metal compound such as metallic cesium, cesium hydroxide, 
cesium hydroxide monohydrate, metallic rubidium, rubidium hydroxide or 

rubidium hydroxide monohydrate is used as a catalyst, crude 
polyoxyalkylene polyol containing the catalyst is neutralized with a 

mineral acid or an organic acid, an aqueous solution layer containing an 
alkali metal salt is brought into contact with an anion exchange resin 

to adsorb mineral acid anion or organic acid anion, the alkali metal 
compound catalyst is recovered, alkylene oxide undergoes ring-opening 

addition polymerization on an active hydrogen compound in the presence 
of the recovered alkali metal compound catalyst to prepare 

polyoxyalkylene polyol, the catalyst is thereafter separated, recovered 
and reused, and such recycle of the alkali metal compound catalyst 

provides a favorable process in economy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for recycling a catalyst
used for preparing polyoxyalkylene polyols.
More particularly, the invention relates
to a process for recycling the polymerization catalyst of alkylene
oxide in the preparation of a polyoxyalkylene polyol which is used for a
raw material of polyurethane resin and a surface active agent.
Polyoxyalkylene polyols which are used for a polyurethane raw material
are usually prepared by conducting ring-opening addition polymerization
of alkylene oxide on an active hydrogen compound initiator in the
presence of an alkaline catalyst. In the preparation of polyoxyalkylene
polyols, various suggestions have been made concerning
the improvement of their productivity and product qualities.It has been known in the preparation of polyoxyalkylene polyols that
an alkylene oxide increases it' s rate of addition polymerization when the
alkylene oxide has a high concentration in the reaction, when the
reaction temperature is high, and when the amount of the polymerization
catalyst, i.e., an alkali metal compound, is increased. Improvement of
productivity by such methods increases at the same time the content of
an unsaturated bond due to a side reaction. The unsaturated bond results from monol which is formed by the side
reaction of propylene oxide, a kind of alkylene oxide, and has a
terminal double bond. The monol gives an adverse effect on the quality
of prepared polyoxyalkylene polyol and leads to unfavorable results
such as deterioration in physical properties of polyurethane resins.Consequently, the effect of polymerization conditions on the
increase in the monol formation has been studied. It has been reported
in Kobunshi Ronbunshu. 50, No. 2, 121 ∼ 126, (1993) that high
temperature reaction gives the largest effect on the increase in the
unsaturated bond, and that the concentration of alkylene oxide and the
concentration of potassium hydroxide polymerization catalyst has a
relatively small influence on the formation of unsaturated bond.
However, limitation is imposed upon the pressure resistance of a
reaction vessel and the concentration of alkylene oxide is relatively
difficult to increase.It can be carried out with extreme ease to raise the concentration
of potassium hydroxide polymerization catalyst. The polymerization
catalyst, however, is separated after reaction from crude
polyoxyalkylene polyol by neutralization with an acid or washing with
water and is thereafter abandoned. Consequently, the increase in
amount of the potassium hydroxide
