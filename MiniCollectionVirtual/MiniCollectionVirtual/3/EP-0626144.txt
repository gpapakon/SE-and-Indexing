<ABSTRACT>
A drawer with metallic drawer frame members (1) or metallic drawer member parts, such as for example pull-out rails (2), the vertical webs of which form the lateral limitation of the drawer at least in the region of the drawer base and which have, at the bottom, a horizontal supporting web (4) on which rests a baseplate (5) made of wood with grooves (17) running parallel to the drawer frame members. A plurality of tabs (13) are punched out of the horizontal webs (4) of the drawer frame members (1), which tabs are oriented transversely to the grooves (17) and reach into the grooves (17) of the baseplate (5). A covering lip (6) which covers the edge of the baseplate (5) is provided on the drawer frame members (1) or the drawer frame member parts. Further tabs (14, 15) are punched out of the horizontal supporting web (4), which tabs bear against the underside of the baseplate (5) beside the groove (17) and by means of which the baseplate (5) can be pressed against the covering lip (6).

<CLAIMS>
A drawer having metal drawer frames or metal drawer-frame 
parts (1), for example pull-out rails (2), of which the vertical 

bars (3) form the lateral delimitation of the drawer at least in 
the region of the drawer base and which have at the bottom a 

horizontal support bar (4) on which there lies a base plate (5) 
of wood or the like having grooves (17) running parallel to the 

drawer frames, there being punched out of the horizontal bars (4) 
of the drawer frames a plurality of lugs (13, 14, 15) which are 

aligned transversely to the grooves and which project into the 
grooves (17) in the base plate (5), there being provided on the 

drawer frames or the drawer-frame parts (1) a covering lip (6) 
which covers the edge of the base plate (5), characterized in 

that there are punched out of the horizontal support bar (4) 
further lugs (14, 15) which, next to the groove (17), abut 

against the underside of the base plate (5), and by means of 
which the base plate (5) may be pressed against the covering lip 

(6). 
A drawer according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
horizontal bars (4) of the drawer frames (1) or of the pull-out 

rails (2) have lugs (13) which project into the grooves (17) in 
the base plate (5) and lugs (14) which, next to the grooves (17), 

abut against the base plate (5). 
A drawer according to Claim 1, characterized in that all the 
lugs (13, 14) of a horizontal bar (4) lie in a line, and the lugs 

(14) which, next to the groove (17), abut against the base plate 
(5) are wider than the groove (17). 
A drawer according to Claim 1, characterized in that at 
least some of the lugs (15) have a front narrow portion (18), 

which projects into the groove (17) in the base plate (5), and 
a rear wide portion (19) which is wider than the groove (17) and 

of which the free edges (20) abut against the underside of the  
 

base plate (5), next to the groove (17). 
A drawer according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that, before being bent out of the planes of the horizontal 

bars (4), the lugs (13, 14, 15) are located in punched holes (16) 
which are longer than the lugs (13, 14, 15) and which enable a 

tool (21, 22) for bending the lugs (13, 14, 15) out to be hooked 
in. 
A tool (21, 22) for bending the lugs (13, 14, 15) out of a 
horizontal bar of a drawer frame or a drawer-frame part (1), 

having a flat bar (23) which may be inserted in the punched holes 
(16) of the lugs (13, 14, 15) and which has a pressing edge (24) 

pressing on the lugs (13, 14, 15), characterized in that a hook 
(25) is constructed on the bar (23), on the side opposite the 

pressing edge (24). 
A tool according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
pressing edge (24) and the hook (25) are offset in the manner of 

a step. 
A tool according to Claim 6, characterized in that there are 
provided two pressing edges (24, 26) which are offset in the 

manner of a step.
