<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cloned region of the 

Bordetella pertussis
 genome located 3' of the 
ptx
 operon 
encoding factors required for expression, assembly or 

secretion of pertussis holotoxin. Methods for obtaining 
increased levels of holotoxin production using homologous 

and heterologous hosts are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
Bordetella pertussis is the primary causative agent 
of pertussis, or whooping cough, an acute infection of the 
respiratory tract. Pertussis occurs worldwide and is most 
severe when it infects unimmunized infants. Currently 
available vaccines (whole cell and partially purified 
acellular) are believed to have approximately 80-90% 
efficacy in the first few years after immunization. 
Effective immunization declines, in the case of whole cell 
vaccines, to almost no efficacy by 12 years post-immunization. 
The duration of protection provided by the 
acellular vaccine is unknown. The currently available 
vaccines are accompanied by a number of adverse reactions, 
some of which are severe or life-threatening. These 
severe reactions can include high fever, seizures, a 
shock-like hyporesponsive state, encephalopathy and severe 
allergic reactions. In addition, individuals completely 
immunized with these vaccines can still develop pertussis. 
A purified component vaccine specific to the pertussis 
holotoxin would be useful for developing specific immunity 
to B. pertussis while minimizing potential adverse side 
effects caused by the currently available complex whole-cell 
or partially purified acellular vaccines. One of the limitations of a purified component B. 
Pertussis vaccine is the time and expense involved in the 
growth and processing of large fermentor volumes of B. 
pertussis required to obtain sufficient amounts of 
pertussis holotoxin (PT) or mutated forms of the toxin 
protein, known as cross reactive materials or CRMs. 
Several investigators have attempted to overcome this 
limitation by overexpression of PT using either homologous  
 
expression systems in B. pertussis, or in closely related 
B. parapertussis or B. bronchiseptica species (Lee, C.K. 
etal., Infect. Immun.57:1413-1418 (1989)), or by 
utilizing heterologous expression systems such as E. coli 
or B. subtilis (Burnette, W.N. etal., Bio/Technology 
6:699-705 (1988); Locht, C. and J.M. Keith, Science 
232:1258-1264 (1986); Nicosta, A., etal., Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA83:4631 (1986)). Unfortunately, these 
efforts have failed to provide any system capable of 
consistently yielding amounts of PT holotoxin 
significantly greater than the amount obtained from 
cultures of wild type B. pertussis. The present invention is based upon the 
identification of a cloned region of the B. pertussis 
genome. This includes a purified or partially purified 
nucleic acid sequence comprising an approximately 8kb 
region of the B. pertussis
