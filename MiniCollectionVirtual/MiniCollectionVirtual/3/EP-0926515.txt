<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a polarizing film
having a dichroic ratio of at least 20 and comprising a

polyvinyl alcohol derivative with a polyvinylene structure
as obtained from a polyvinyl alcohol material having a

degree of polymerization of at least 2000.
The polarizing film of the present invention has
excellent polarizing properties in the range of the visible

ray spectrum, and exhibits excellent durability when left
in high-temperature and high-humidity surroundings for a

long period of time. The polarizing film of the present
invention is useful for a polarizing sheet laminated with a

protective film for on-vehicle LCD that is placed in heavy
temperature and humidity fluctuations, such as LCD

navigation systems, LCD TV, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polarizing film comprising a polyvinyl alcohol derivative with a polyvinylene structure.A Polarizing sheet having a light-transmitting and shielding function laminated with protective films is a basic constituent element for a liquid crystal display (LCD), along with a liquid crystal having a light-switching function. The applications of the LCD include small-sized instruments such as pocket calculators, watches, etc. in the early years, as well as lap-top personal computers, word processors, liquid-crystal color projectors, on-vehicle navigation systems, liquid-crystal TV, indoor and outdoor measuring instruments, etc. The LCD has been used in heavy temperature and humidity fluctuations of from low temperature to high temperature and from low humidity to high humidity. Accordingly, there has been desired a polarizing sheet which has excellent durability such as wet heat resistance, etc. and excellent polarizing properties.A polarizing sheet has a structure that both sides of a polarizing film as obtained from a polyvinyl alcohol (hereinafter referred to as PVA) film are laminated with supporting films of cellulose triacetate or the like. As a polarizing film, there have been known an iodine-containing polarizing film as prepared by dyeing a PVA film with iodine, a dye containing polarizing film as prepared by dyeing a PVA film with a dichroic dye, and a polarizing film of a PVA derivative with a polyvinylene structure as prepared by dehydrating a PVA film (U.S. Patent No. 2,173,304).The iodine-containing polarizing film and the dye-containing polarizing film have good polarizing properties, while they have a problem that their durability is poor. The polarizing film of a polyvinyl alcohol derivative with a polyvinylene structure has excellent durability, while it has a problem that its polarizing property is poor.US-A-3,914,017 discloses dichroic light polarizers comprising a transparent sheet of a graft copolymer, the graft copolymer comprising a polyvinyl alcohol backbone onto which is grafted polymeric units derived from vinyl(idene) monomers, and wherein the backbone is substantially molecularly oriented and at least partially dehydrated.US-A-4,895,769 discloses stainable polymeric sheet articles adapted to the production of light polarizers therefrom and comprising a biaxially oriented polymeric support sheet carrying a coated layer of polyvinyl alcohol.US-A-5,071,906 discloses polarizable films comprising a uniaxially stretched film containing a polyvinyl
