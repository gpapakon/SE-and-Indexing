<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an organic electrolyte lithium 
secondary battery wherein lithium works as an active material, and 

comprises a negative electrode made of metallic lithium or lithium 
alloy, and relates more particular to a separator of the same 

battery. A conventional battery uses a separator made of poly 
ethylene and/or poly propylene, however, this invention uses 

microporous polyolefin membrane as a separator matrix whose pores 
are filled and closed with ionic conductive gel electrolyte. 

The separator uses a sheet whose at least one face contacting 
the negative electrode has a gel electrolyte layer on it. 
The gel electrolyte is formed by irradiating ultraviolet ray 
to a mixed solution wherein a mixture of which major components 

are oligomer and monomer polymertized by ultra violet ray is 
added to organic electrolyte. 
By using the separator according to this invention in an 
organic electrolyte lithium secondary battery, internal 

shortcircuits due to dendrited lithium growing on a negative 
electrode during a charge can be prevented, and a longer cycle 

life is expected. Further, burning accidents can be reduced. 
A highly reliable lithium secondary battery can be thus achieved.

 
 

Note: The expression "dendrited lithium" means that metal lithium 
deposited on a negative electrode grows in a form of (or in a 

shape of ) dendrite.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an organic 
electrolyte lithium secondary battery of which the negative electrode 
consists of metallic lithium or lithium alloy and using lithium 
as an active material, and more particularly, to a separator of 
the same battery. The lithium secondary battery of which negative electrode 
consists of metallic lithium or lithium alloy and using lithium 
as an active material and organic electrolyte draws attention to 
the point of a light-weight and compact power source, for the same 
battery has a higher energy density due to a higher voltage, and 
shows a better performance at low temperatures than general 
secondary batteries having an electrolyte of an aqueous solution. However, active lithium deposited on a negative electrode in 
charging reacts to and decomposes an organic solvent of 
electrolyte, and deposited metallic lithium grows to dendrite and  
 
reacts to the organic solvent and then forms an insulating layer 
on the dendrited lithium surface, which results in forming 
poor-electronic-conductive lithium. R. Selim Bro, J. Electrochem. 
Soc, 121, 1457 (1974), etc. already reported this problem. This 
phenomena lowers the charge and discharge efficiency of a negative 
electrode composed of metallic lithium and lithium alloy, and also 
reduces a battery capacity in the progress of charge and discharge 
cycles. Further, the dendrited metal lithium penetrates a 
separator to shortcircuit the battery inside, which shortens a 
cycle life. Due to these problems, the organic electrolyte 
lithium secondary battery of which negative electrode consists of 
metallic lithium or lithium alloy and using lithium as an active 
material is not yet practically used. The occurrence of the dendrited lithium correlates with a 
charge current density, namely, the higher the current density is, 
the easier occurs dendrited lithium. In general, the lithium 
secondary batteries thus are devised to have a less charge current 
density: In order to enlarge the areas of each facing plate of 
negative and positive electrodes, the thin electrode plates are 
scrolled with a separator in between. The such electrode plate 
group and organic electrolyte have been studied to comprise the 
battery. However, since the plate surface is not smooth enough, 
a reaction occurs at some particular places, which forms dendrited 
lithium. The dendrited lithium thus formed on a negative 
electrode of lithium penetrates through a separator made of  
 
microporous membrane, and produces internal
