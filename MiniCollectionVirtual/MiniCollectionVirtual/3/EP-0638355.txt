<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a proportioning device for supplying an additive (2) to a volume flow of a basic material (44), in particular for adding an additive (2) during filling of fuel oil from a mobile tanker vehicle into tanks. An injection arrangement, which supplies the additive (2) from a reservoir (1) to the volume flow of the basic material (44) in a predeterminable mixing ratio, and a control arrangement (43), which defines and regulates the volume to be injected of the additive (2) depending upon the volume flow of the basic material (44), are provided. The injection arrangement is an axial piston pump (15) with swash plate (16) which has a drive for an injection of the additive (2). To adhere to the mixing ratio, the injection volume of the additive (2) is adapted, by the control arrangement (43) by means of regulation of the drive, in particular of a drive motor (25), to a variable volume flow of the basic material (44).
