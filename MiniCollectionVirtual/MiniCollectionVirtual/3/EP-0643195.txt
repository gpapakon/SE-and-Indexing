<ABSTRACT>
A combination of a rubber or other elastomer part (22a) and 
a plastic or metal part (24a) is bonded by both chemical and 

mechanical means. The mechanical means is in the form of 
molded rivets (30) integrally manufactured in the molding 

process as part of the elastomer (22a). Appropriate mating holes 
are made in the plastic or metal parts (24a) to receive the 

rivets (30) during the molding process or at least before the 
rivets are cured. Conventional chemical bonding materials 

for the circumstance are employed with the rivet bonding to 
provide dual bonding strength. The parts of a blowout 

preventer, such as at the T-seal (22a) and the upper seal (20), are 
disclosed as preferred examples of locations that are 

subject to high pressure and temperature where an elastomer 
part is bonded to a plastic or a metal part.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the bonding together of
high performance parts, one of which is rubber or other
elastomer and the other part being plastic or metal and
more particularly to the bonding together of such parts
that are part of a well head blowout preventer.There are chemical bonding materials that are
considered to be high performing in applications where an
elastomer, typically rubber, is bonded or adhered to a
dissimilar material, such as plastic or metal. One such
application is in blowout preventers where the packer for
closing off the annulus of a well, sometimes under
emergency conditions, is made up of a combination of
elastomer and plastic and/or metal parts. Typically, the
packer either closes around a well pipe extending through
the central bore or opening of the blowout preventer, or
packer assemblies close together after the well pipe is
sheared off.The bonding of parts is necessary to prevent the
elastomer parts from separating from the dissimilar
material parts when subjected to extremely high pressures
(e.g., 7,03 kp/mm2 - 14,06 kp/mm2 (10,000 to 20,000 psi)) or extremely high pressures
and temperatures (e.g., 82째C - 204째C (180째F to 400째F)). A slight
separation becomes a problem in the overall operation in
two main ways. First, a slightly separated part changes 
the dimensioning of the assembly of parts, which
dimensional change can interfere with normal operation and
can cause the interfering part to be cut off when operation
forces the closing or opening of other parts of the
assembly. Thus, a separated elastomer part that is
supposed to seal is often cut off so that it no longer
adequately seals in the intended manner. Secondly,
separation of assembly parts, one of which is an elastomer
that readily "flows" when subjected to extremely high
pressures or high pressure and high temperatures, creates
"gaps" and permits the extrusion of the elastomer between
adjacent metal pieces where the metal-to-metal contact or
fit is less than perfect. High pressures tend to extrude
the elastomer through small gaps. High temperatures cause
the elastomer to become soft, so when present together,
elastomers extrude rather easily. Extrusion of the
elastomer can result in both high pressure and low pressure
leaks and other harmful conditions, which, if bad enough
can result in premature wear-out of parts and even in
creating dangerous operating conditions.Even the toughest metal/plastic-to-elastomer bonding
materials can fail under adverse conditions. First, the
bonding material between metal or

A packer for a blowout preventer for holding back
fluids under high pressure and high temperature conditions,

characterised by

a molded elastomer (22a, 42) including a plurality of integrally
molded projecting rivets (30, 46),
an adjoining plastic or metal part (24a, 46) including
matchingly aligned rivet holes,
a bonding line composition suitable for bonding to
both the elastomer and the adjoining part, said

bonding line composition being applied to the
interface between the elastomer and the adjoining

part so as to include the contacting surfaces of
said rivets and said rivet holes,
said rivets being integrally molded into said rivet holes
before complete curing so as to compress said

elastomer to said adjoining part upon complete
curing.
A packer in accordance with claim 1, wherein said
elastomer (22a, 42) includes rubber.
A packer in accordance with claim 1, wherein each
of said rivets (30, 46) is elongated and round in cross section,

thereby adding integral elastomer material and shear
strength to the bonding line composition.
A packer in accordance with claim 3, wherein each
of said rivets includes an enlarged diameter end portion

and a reduced diameter portion (34) adjacent to its end portion.
A packer in accordance with claim 4, wherein each
of said rivets includes an enlarged diameter base portion

(32) adjacent to said reduced diameter portion. 
The process for mechanically and chemically
bonding a mating plastic or metal part (24a, 44) of a blowout

preventer packer to an elastomer part (22a, 42) and to thereby
maintain bonding under high pressure and high temperature

conditions, which comprises

molding the elastomer part into the desired shape and
including integrally molding a plurality of

rivets (30, 46) in the elastomer part interface surface to
prepare it for bonding to the plastic or metal

part,
forming the mating plastic or metal part with
accommodating rivet holes for each of the

elastomer rivets,
coating the interface surfaces of the elastomer part
including the rivet surfaces with a bonding

composition for bonding the elastomer part with
the matching plastic or metal part, and
integrally molding the rivets into the rivet holes
before the elastomer part and the bonding

composition sets to accomplish both mechanical
and chemical bonding of the elastomer part to the

plastic or metal part to thereby cause
compression of the bonding composition upon post-molding

shrinking of the rivets.
The process for mechanically and chemically
bonding in accordance with claim 6, and including


molding each of the rivets (30, 46) to have an enlarged outer
end and forming each of the rivet holes to have

an accommodating shape for matingly receiving the
rivets with the enlarged ends to thereby cause

compression of the bonding composition upon post-molding
shrinking of the rivets.
