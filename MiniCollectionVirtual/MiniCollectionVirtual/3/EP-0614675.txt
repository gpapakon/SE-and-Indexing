<ABSTRACT>
Drip chamber and/or expansion chamber comprising a housing 
(1) with an upper part (6) and a lower part (2), each of 

which being provided with one or more inlets and/or outlets 
(3,7), and at least one filter (4) arranged between said 

parts. 
The chamber according to the invention is characterized in 
that at least one such filter (4) is integrally formed with 

one of said parts (2 and/or 6). 
The invention also comprises a method of manufacturing a 
chamber of the above mentioned type. The method is 

characterized in that at least the part which includes the 
filter (4) is injection moulded, whereby the filter (4) is 

obtained by the use of a core (13) which simultaneously 
creates an inlet to, or an outlet (3) from, the filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drip chamber and/or 
expansion chamber comprising a housing with an upper part 
and a lower part, each of which being provided with one or 
more inlets and/or outlets, and at least one filter 
arranged between said parts, and a method for manufacturing 
such a chamber. The chamber is preferably intended to be used for 
filtration of blood during extracorporeal blood treatment, 
for example during haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration or 
haemofiltration. Chambers for the above-stated purposes can be manufactured 
for example by blow moulding, as described in EP-B1-0 058 
325. Such chambers are however difficult to provide with 
filters and are thus suitably combined with separate 
filters. A chamber according to the preamble portion of claim 1 
is known from EP-A-0 033 080. Alternatively, chambers can be manufactured by injection 
moulding. 
In such cases, the chambers have until now 
been provided with subsequently added filters which can be 
arranged in accordance with that described in the German 
document or can be arranged to be clamped between the 
chamber housing and an associated cap.  
 The present invention thus relates to a drip chamber and/or 
expansion chamber comprising a housing with an upper part 
and a lower part, each of which being provided with one or 
more inlets and/or outlets, and at least one filter 
arranged between said parts. The chamber according to the invention is characterized in 
that at least one such filter is integrally formed with one 
of said parts. In this manner the number of components is 
reduced in comparison with conventional chambers provided 
with filters. The filter is suitably manufactured simultaneously with its 
associated part by injection moulding in a single mould. 
Other methods of manufacture are however conceivable. A simple and practical design is obtained when the housing 
consists of an elongated, preferably circular-cylindrical 
sleeve which, at both its ends, is closed by said parts, of 
which one or both can consist of a cap attached to the 
sleeve. A simple design and simple moulding tools are obtained when 
the filter or filters are arranged extending from an inlet 
and/or an outlet part way into the housing. In a preferred embodiment of the chamber according to the 
invention, the filter or filters are cylindrically shaped 
and preferably have their filter openings arranged on the 
cylindrical surface. This allows a great deal of freedom to 
vary the filter surface and the number of filter openings.

<CLAIMS>
Drip chamber and/or expansion chamber comprising a 
housing (1) with an upper part (6) and a lower part (2), 

each of which being provided with one or more inlets and/or 
outlets (3,7), and at least one filter (4) arranged between 

said parts, 
characterized
 in that at least one such filter 
(4) is integrally formed with one of said parts (2, 

6). 
Chamber according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the filter and its associated part (2, 6) were 

manufactured simultaneously by injection moulding in a 
single mould. 
Chamber according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the housing (1) consists of an elongated, preferably 

circular-cylindrical sleeve which, at both its ends, is 
closed by said parts (2, 6), of which one or both can 

consist of a cap attached to the sleeve. 
Chamber according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the filter or filters (4,4') 
are arranged extending from an inlet (7) or an outlet (3) 

part way into the housing (1). 
Chamber according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the filter or filters (4,4') 
are cylindrically shaped and preferably have their filter 

openings (8) arranged on the cylindrical surface.  
 
Chamber according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the filter or filters (4,4') are conically shaped, 

preferably with the tip directed towards the interior of 
the housing (1), with the filter openings (8) being 

advantageously arranged in the conical surface. 
Chamber according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 

characterized
 in that the filter openings (8) are elongated 
and arranged in the longitudinal direction of the filter 

(4) and/or are formed as circular arcs around the filter's 
circular-cylindrical surface. 
Chamber according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in that 
the filter openings (8) are elongated and arranged as 

circular arcs perpendicular to the generatrix of the cone 

and/or are straight and arranged along said generatrix. 
Chamber according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
said filter (4) is arranged at an otherwise sealed base (2) 

of an elongated housing (1) between the interior of the 
housing and a nipple (3) serving as an inlet and/or outlet 

(Fig. 1). 
Chamber according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the filter or filters (4,4') 
are arranged further in in the housing by the provision of 

a non-filtering spacer (16) between the filter and its 
associated inlet and/or outlet (Fig. 11). 
Chamber according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized
 in that the filter is arranged at the one end 
of an elongated housing (1) which is open at its other end, 

which housing, after moulding, is then sealed at both ends 
by means of caps (2 and 6) which are provided with 

necessary inlets and/or outlets (3,7) (Fig. 15).  
 
Method of manufacturing a chamber according to any 
one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that at least 
the part which includes the filter (4) is injection 

moulded, whereby the filter (4) is obtained by the use of 
a core (13) which simultaneously creates an inlet to, or an 

outlet (3) from, the filter. 
Method according to claim 12, 
characterized
 in that 
said core (13) is conically shaped and provided with 

projections on its surface to create required filter 
openings (8). 
Method according to claim 12 or 13, 
characterized
 
in that the outer surface of the filter (4) is formed by a 

core or other mould component (10) which is arranged to be
