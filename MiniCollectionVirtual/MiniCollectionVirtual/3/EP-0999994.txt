<ABSTRACT>
A method for removing biguanide from aqueous sources, such as swimming pools, is disclosed. The method includes the steps of bringing at least one polymeric metaphosphate into contact with the aqueous source in a sufficient concentration to form particles containing the biguanide. The particles containing at least a portion of the biguanide can then be removed by various means, including filtration or vacuuming.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the removal of biguanide or biguanide polymer from aqueous sources,
such as swimming pools.Biguanide is used as a non-chlorine swimming pool treatment to control the
spread of microbes. It is generally believed that biguanide exhibits cationic properties,
wherein the nitrogen atoms present in the biguanide polymer exhibit a positive charge.
In controlling microorganisms, the biguanide attaches to the negatively charged
membrane of the microorganism and the charged nitrogen acts to disrupt the transfer of
hydrogen ions by disrupting membrane phospholipids in the cell of the microorganism.
As a result, the microorganism uses up all of its energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine
Triphosphate) and eventually dies.WO-A-9515683 discloses a method for controlling the growth of algae, fungi and pathogenic organisms in a swimming pool, comprising adding to the water, preferably in composition form, biguanide polymer as primary sanitizing agent and a calcium chelating agent such as a hexametaphosphate. The chelating agent is added in amounts such that it renders the composition sufficiently algicidal and fungicidal in the water.While biguanide has these advantageous properties, it is generally understood that
when the parts per million of biguanide falls below 50 ppm, some semi-resistant strains
of microorganisms can exist. In order to combat these semi-resistant strains of
microorganisms, a hypochlorite ejection is used which is also known as a shock
treatment. The hypochlorite reacts, however, with the biguanide, to form a dispersion
wherein the hypochlorite ions surround the nitrogen in the biguanide. Generally, the
hypochlorite ions do not displace all of the water molecules around the polymer and thus a
dispersion occurs. Light refracts on the polymer chain of the dispersion and makes the
water appear milky which is an undesirable effect, especially in swimming pools.
Accordingly, one way to remove biguanide from the pool before any shock treatment
with a chlorine-based compound is by oxidation which takes a number of days, for
example approximately 14 days. Obviously, such a waiting period is undesirable.A feature of the present invention is to provide a method to remove at least a
portion of biguanide from aqueous sources, such as swimming pools. Another feature of the present invention is to provide a method of not only
removing biguanide from an aqueous source, but doing so in an amount of time that is
less than 14 days.Additional features and advantages of the present
