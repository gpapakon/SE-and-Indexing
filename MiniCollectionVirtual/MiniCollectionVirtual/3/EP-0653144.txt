<ABSTRACT>
An audio enhancement system (20) and method of use with a sound system for producing primary sound from at least one main loudspeaker (23) located at a main position. The audio enhancement system (20) comprises at least one wireless transmitter (30-N), time delay circuitry (36-N), and plural augmented sound producing subsystems (32-N). Each sound subsystem (32-N) is a portable unit arranged to be carried by a person located remote from the main loudspeaker (23) and includes a wireless receiver (48) and an associated transduce device, e.g., a pair of stereo headphones (60). The transmitter broadcasts an electrical signal which is representative of the electrical input signal provided to the main loudspeaker (23). The broadcast signal is received by the receiver (48) and is demodulated and amplified to drive the transducer (60 or 62) so that it produces augmented sound substantially in synchronism wit the sound arriving from the main loudspeaker (23). To achieve that end the time delay circuitry (36-N) delays the electrical signal which is provided to the transducer (60 or 62) for a predetermined period of time corresponding generally to the time period it takes for the primary sound to propagate through the air from the main loudspeaker (23) to the remote location at which the person is located.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to audio
systems and more particularly to systems for enhancing the
sound received by audiences located at varying distances from
loudspeakers.The current state of the art for sound production
or sound supporting equipment used in concert halls or in
other spaces entails the use of one or more main loudspeaker
cluster locations. These are typically located near the
physical location of the actual sound source or that of the
virtual sound source. Unfortunately nature has provided some
impediments for these types of sound systems. In this regard
as the sound produced by the loudspeakers travel over
distance, distortion of the frequency and time spectrum
naturally occur. Also, non-linear type are introduced due to
the physics of the air compression and rare fractions by
which the sound propagates. Moreover, since the perceived
loudness and the sound pressure level decreases with
increasing distance from the sound source, in order to
achieve the desired sound pressure level (SPL) at remote
listener positions substantially more sound pressure must be
developed at the source. However, increasing the sound
pressure level thereat produces more distortions. Thus, the
larger the distance from the sound source to the audience the
more acute the problem.Persons attending concerts in large halls or arenas
are becoming more demanding in their desires for high quality
sound; they want to have the sound quality delivered to them
by public address speaker systems approaching recording
studio quality. This places a heavy burden on the large
sound system designer. One common approach to achieve that
end is utilize what has been referred to as "delayed speaker
systems" in combination with the main loudspeaker system. In
particular, additional loudspeakers are provided at remote
locations so that they can be located closer to some of the 
audience than the main loudspeaker(s) or cluster(s). These
fixed remote loudspeakers typically have their input signals
delayed in time with respect to the signals provided to the
main loudspeaker(s)/cluster(s) to synchronize their acoustic
output with that arriving from the main loudspeaker(s) or
cluster(s).In an article appearing in the Journal Of The Audio
Engineering Society, Vol. 28, No. 10, October 1980, entitled
Sound Reinforcement Systems In Early Danish Churches, by Dan
Popescu, there are disclosed distributed loudspeaker systems
making use of remotely located loudspeakers and delay
equipment to synchronize the amplified sound with the

generating a primary sound in response to a first electrical

signal;
transmission means (30) for converting said first electrical
signal into a transmission signal and for wirelessly transmitting

said transmission signal;
at least one receiver/transducer unit (48), disposed at a
location remote from said main transducer such that said primary
