<ABSTRACT>
An optical information recording medium is disclosed. The 
optical information recording medium has a transparent substrate 

having pits and lands corresponding to information signals formed 
therein, and a reflective layer formed on the transparent 

substrate. The reflective layer is composed mainly of a dye 
material and a polymeric material and has a reflectance of 15 to 

25%. The polymeric material forming the reflective layer is a 
silicon varnish.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical information recording
medium, and particularly to a reproduction-only optical
information recording medium capable of recording and/or
reproduction therein by using a recording/reproducing apparatus
for magneto-optical recording medium.As the optical information recording media, the compact disc
(CD) and the laser disc (LD) have already been prevailed broadly.
These compact disc and laser disc are reproduction-only optical
discs each of which has a reflective layer and, if necessary, a
protecting layer on a substrate having pits and lands
corresponding to information signals formed in advance, and from
which pre-recorded information signals are reproduced. A
material of high reflectance, that is low absorptance, such as
Al or Au is used for the reflective layer.Meanwhile, the magneto-optical disc has been developed
recently as an optical information recording medium in which
information is writable and deletable, in contrast to the above-mentioned
reproduction-only optical disc. The magneto-optical
disc has a recording section formed by stacking a recording
magnetic layer having an axis of easy magnetization perpendicular 
to the film surface and large magneto-optical effect (such as a
rare earth-transition metal alloy amorphous thin film), a
reflective layer and a dielectric layer on a substrate. The
magneto-optical disc of such structure having a small diameter
of 64 mm, that is, a so-called mini disc, contained in a disc
cartridge is now prevailing.Meanwhile, in order to improve prevalence and practicality
of both the reproduction-only optical disc and magneto-optical
disc systems, it is preferred that reproduction can be carried
out with the reproduction-only optical disc by the
recording/reproducing apparatus for magneto-optical disc.
However, the reproduction-only optical disc having the reflective
layer of Al film or Au film has an extremely high reflectance of
70% or higher to a laser light, in comparison to the reflectance
of magneto-optical disc of 15 to 25%. Therefore, reproduction
of signals from the reproduction-only disc cannot be carried out
by the recording/reproducing apparatus for magneto-optical disc.Thus, a dye-containing layer composed of a dye material and
a polymeric material is used instead of the Al film or the Au
film, as the reflective layer. For instance, an optical disc
using a cyanine dye as the dye material has a reflectance of 15
to 25%, similar to that of the magneto-optical disc, and is
therefore expected to be promising as a
