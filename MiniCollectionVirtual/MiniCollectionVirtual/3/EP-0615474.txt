<ABSTRACT>
In a machine for the formation of helical lock-seam tubing, guide rollers (24A, 25B) are arranged to locate superposed metal strips (9, 11) in laterally staggered relative positions in such a manner that the strips can be passed through forming and clinching means whilst in the overlapped state, whereby finished tubing has a locked seam with each of the walls joined in the seam being formed by multiple layers of metal strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements in machines for
the formation of helical lock-seam tubing, and relates more
especially to such a machine adapted for the production of
such tubing having a multiple wall thickness.It has hitherto been proposed, see FR-A-2,032,737 and
FR-A-2,107,500, to provide helical lock-seam tubing having
a multiple wall thickness.
Document US-A-3263321 discloses a further machine, which
comprises the combination of features according to the preamble
of claim 1.
Hitherto, however, the
production of a machine capable of forming such tubing has
proposed practical difficulties.Is accordingly an object of the invention to provide
such a machine.In accordance with the invention there is provided
machine for the formation of helical lock-seam tubing,
according to claim 1. Various further optional features may be incorporated
in the machine, in accordance with the invention, in order
further to improve the effective handling of the overlapped
strips.Thus, according to one embodiment of the invention,
the distance of lateral
displacement is so selected that relative displacement
of the edges of the strips during forming of said flanges
and clinching of said lock-seam brings the lateral edges of
the respective strips to lie in a substantially common
plane. The shoulders of the guide rollers may be adapted
to provide for the location of two overlapping strips or
three, or possibly more overlapping strips.The
drive roller that is arranged for gripping engagement with
the exposed surface of that one of the overlapping strips
that is to be at the exterior surface of the finished
tubing may have a knurled or patterned surface. Thus the arrangement
of drive rollers is the reverse of that which is
utilised in the conventional machine for forming lock-seam 
tubing.In accordance with a yet further development of the
invention, there are provided at the entry to the helical
forming head of the machine, one or more shaped counter-pressure
plates including portions shaped to the radius of
curvature of the internal surface of the finished tubing,
whereby the overlapping metal strips are held closely in
contact with one another during initial bending to the
radius of curvature of the helical forming head.In order to feed helically coiled strips from supply
reels, in overlapping relationship, to the rollers and the
forming head of the machine, independent supply reels
carrying the respective strips may be arranged one behind
the other in the direction of advance of the strip towards
the machine, in such

<CLAIMS>
A machine for the formation of helical lock-seam tubing,
including a series of adjacent forming rollers (22-24) for

receiving a metal strip and for forming male and female flanges
on opposite marginal edges of said strip, a pair of drive

rollers (20,21) for drawing the metal strip through the forming
rollers (22-24), an external helical forming head (40) arranged

to receive said metal strip from the drive rollers (20,21) and
to guide it passively to form a helix and to bring said male and

female flanges into interengagement, and clinching rollers
associated with said forming head (40) and for clinching said

male and female flanges into locking engagement with one another
to provide a helical locked-seam, consecutive helices of which

are spaced apart by a distance determined by the width of the
metal strip, said machine further including

supply means (2,3;6,7,8) for feeding a plurality of overlapped
metal strips to said forming rollers (22-24), characterised in that

between said supply means (2,3;6,7,8) and said forming rollers (22-24)
there are provided guide rollers (25a,25b) between which the

overlapped metal strips are fed to said forming rollers, that
said guide rollers are provided with radially stepped shoulders

so arranged that, in use, the metal strips passing between the
rollers are held in a laterally staggered relationship to one

another, and that said guide rollers (25a,25b) are located
immediately adjacent said forming rollers (22-24) as part of a

common train of rollers whereby, in use, the metal strips are
held in their lateral relationship by the guide rollers (25) as 

they are formed by the forming rollers (22-24). 
A machine according to Claim 1, characterised in
that,

the distance of
lateral displacement being so selected that relative

displacement of the edges of the strips during forming of
said flanges and clinching of said lock-seam brings the

lateral edges of the respective strips to lie in a 
substantially common plane.
A machine according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the drive roller (21) that is arranged for gripping

engagement with the exposed surface of that one of the
overlapping strips that is to be at the exterior surface of

the finished tubing has a knurled or patterned surface.
A machine according to Claim 1, characterised in
that there are provided at the entry to the helical forming

head (40) of the machine, one or more shaped counter-pressure
plates (44,45) including portions shaped to the

radius of curvature of the internal surface of the finished
tubing, whereby the overlapping metal strips are held

closely in contact with one another during initial bending
to the radius of curvature of the helical forming head.
A machine according to Claim 2, characterised in
that, in order to feed helically coiled strips in

overlapping relationship, to the rollers (20-25) and the
forming head (40) of the machine, independent supply reels

(2,3;6,7,8) carrying the respective strips are arranged one
behind the other in the direction of advance of the strip

towards the machine, in such a manner that the strip fed
from the reel (3;8) more remote from the machine is brought

into contact with the next adjacent strip substantially at
a point where the path of the first strip becomes

tangential to a radius of the reel feeding the next
adjacent strip.
A machine according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that three individual strips are arranged to be fed to the

said guide rollers (25) of the machine from corresponding
supply reels (6,7,8) and there is interposed between that

supply reel (2) nearest to the machine and said guide
rollers (25), a guide arrangement (12) for maintaining the

respective strips in spaced relation, such that the central
strip is maintained substantially coinciding with a guide

path tangential to both said rollers (25a, 25b), the
remaining strips being fed along paths extending

substantially symmetrically to the plane of the
intermediate strip.
A machine as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in
that said guide means (12), comprises a first pair of

spaced apart upper and lower guide rollers (30,31),
arranged to engage upper and lower ones of said three

strips, a second pair of upper and lower guide rollers
between which the three strips are passed into contact with

one another, and a locating means (33-35) arranged between
said first pair of spaced apart guide rollers (30,31) in

order to receive and guide the third strip.
A machine according to Claim 7, characterised in
that said locating means comprises a pair of upper and

lower guide plates (24,25) and a pair of lateral guide
plates (33) defining a guide path for said third strip.
A machine according to Claim 8, characterised in
that the arrangement is such that in use said upper and lower

strips are metal strips to form inner and outer walls of 
the clinched lock-seam tube and the third strip is a strip

of insulating material to be located between said inner and
outer walls.
