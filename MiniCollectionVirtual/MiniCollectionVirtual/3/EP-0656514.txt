<ABSTRACT>
In order to dry and cure a coating based on a water-dilutable lacquer system, heat is supplied to the coating by means of an infrared emitter (1). In order to accelerate the evaporation of water, an air stream oriented perpendicularly to the infrared radiation is generated by means of a blower (2) between the article, on which the coating is applied, and the infrared emitter (1). The power of the infrared emitter (1) and/or that of the blower (2) can be varied in the course of the drying and curing operation.

Process for drying and/or curing water-dilutable
coatings, such as paint systems or base material systems, in

which process heat is supplied by infrared radiation and, in
the space between the at least one infrared radiator and the

article to which the coating to be dried and/or cured is
applied, an air stream oriented substantially at

right-angles to the direction of the infrared radiation is
produced with a direction of flow from the top to the bottom

or horizontally, characterised in that, in a first process
stage, a first layer of the coating to be produced is

applied and the power of the fan producing the air stream is
selected to be higher than in a second or following process

stage in which a second or further layer of the coating is
applied, and in that, in the first process stage, the power

given off by the infrared radiator is selected to be lower
than in the second or following process stage.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
heat is supplied by means of at least one infrared radiator.
Device for carrying out the process according to claim
1 or 2, having at least one infrared radiator (1), and

having at least one apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15) for producing
an air stream between the infrared radiator (1) and the

article to which the coating to be dried and/or cured is
applied, the outlet opening (8) for the air stream produced

by the apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15) being arranged at the front
side of the infrared radiator (1) and being oriented

substantially transversely to the plane of the infrared
radiator (1), characterised in that the apparatus (2, 5, 10,

15) for producing an air stream is provided at at least one
edge of the infrared radiator (1), in that the power of the 

infrared radiator (1) and of the apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15)
for producing the air stream is alterable, and in that

patterns in the changes of the power of the infrared
radiator (1) and/or of the apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15) for

producing the air stream are stored in a memory and can
optionally be accessed.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15) for producing the air stream is

arranged at the, in the use position, upper edge and/or at a
side edge of the infrared radiator (1).
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that
the apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15) for producing the air stream is

a fan (2, 5, 10).
Device according to either claim 3 or claim 4,
characterised in that the apparatus (2, 5, 10, 15) for

producing the air stream is an ejector nozzle (15) operated
with compressed air.
Device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that
the fan (2, 5, 10) or the ejector nozzle (15) is pivotable

relative to the infrared radiator (1).
Device according to any one of claims 5 to 7,
characterised in that a filter (9) is associated with the

air inlet opening and preferably the air outlet opening of
the fan (2, 5, 10) or the ejector nozzle (15).
