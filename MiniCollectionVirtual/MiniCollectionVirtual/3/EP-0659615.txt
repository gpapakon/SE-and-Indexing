<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pedal arrangement (1) for a vehicle, having a pedal support (8) which has two support limbs (2, 3) which are arranged at a distance from one another and between which there is pivotably mounted a pedal (15), a pedal shaft (19) being inserted by both its ends into the shaft bearing (22, 23) which is open facing the pedal shaft and the pedal support being provided, in the region of its two ends (7, 10), with seats for fastening the pedal arrangement between stationary components of the vehicle. According to the invention, it is proposed that each support limb have a deforming region, the shaft bearings which are connected to the support limbs disengaging from the pedal shaft when a force which is imparted to the pedal support via at least one of the stationary components is exceeded. This disengagement of the pedal from the pedal support ensures that in the event of a collision, any threat to the health of the driver due to displacement of the pedal is avoided to a substantial extent.

Pedal mechanism for a vehicle, in particular a brake 
or clutch pedal mechanism for a motor vehicle, with a 

pedal strut (8) comprising two spaced-apart strut arms 
(23) as well as, between the two strut arms, a 

pivotably mounted pedal (15) which is engaged, at a 
distance from the pivot shaft (19) of the pedal, by an 

actuating element for an element to be acted upon by 
the pedal, in particular brake or clutch element, 

wherein a pedal shaft (19) with both ends (7, 10) is 
inserted in journal bearings (22, 23) opening towards 

the pedal shaft, and the pedal strut in the region of 
its two ends (7, 10) is provided with receptacles for 

fixing the pedal mechanism between stationary 
components of the vehicle, characterised in that each 

strut arm (2, 3) comprises a shaped region, wherein 
the journal bearings (22, 23) connected to the strut 

arms (2, 3) become disengaged from the pedal shaft 
(19) on exceeding a force applied to the pedal strut 

(8) via at least one of the stationary components. 
Pedal mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in 
that each strut arm (2, 3) in the region of its 

journal bearing (22, 23) comprises the shaped region. 
Pedal mechanism according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the shaped region of each strut 

arm (2, 3) is designed as a free bent length or free 
buckled length. 
Pedal mechanism according to claim 3, characterised in 
that each strut arm (2, 3) comprises several 

predetermined bend points (35, 36) which are arranged 
in particular on both sides of the associated journal 

bearing (22, 23). 
Pedal mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterised in that the respective strut arm (2, 3) 
is designed as a plate-shaped component. 
Pedal mechanism according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the plate-shaped strut arms (2, 3) receive 

between them the pedal shaft (19), wherein the 
respective strut arm (2, 3) in the region of the 

journal bearing (22, 23) facing towards them is curved 
away from the other strut arm (3, 2). 
Pedal mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the two strut arms (2, 3) are 

connected to each other in the region of one end (7) 
of the pedal strut (8). 
Pedal mechanism according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the two strut arms (2, 3) adjacent to the 

connecting region (7) thereof form with each other an 
acute angle. 
Pedal mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that one end (7) of the pedal strut 

(8) can be connected to a stationary component having 
the function of a system support, and the other end 

(10) of the pedal strut (8) can be connected to a 
stationary component having the function of a fixed 

wall. 
Pedal mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the respective journal bearing 

(22, 23) is designed as a rotationally symmetrical 
attachment connected to one of the strut arms (2, 3), 

and the pedal shaft (19) which is designed as a sleeve 
is fitted onto the journal bearings (22, 23), and also 

the pedal (15) is connected non-rotatably to the pedal 
shaft (19).  

 
Pedal mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the pedal (15 ) is suspended. 
Pedal mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised that in the shaped region, rigidly 

connected to one (3) of the strut arms (2, 3), is one 
end of a plate-like element (31) of which the other 

end is attached in frictionally locking relationship 
to the other strut arm (2).
