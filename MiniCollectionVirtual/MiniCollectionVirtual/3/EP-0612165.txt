<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated optical filter which is rapidly tunable 
over a 

wide optical frequency range comprises an input frequency router 
connected to an output frequency router by means of switchable gates. 

The input frequency router is a wavelength selective 1xN waveguide 
grating coupler and the switchable gate is a waveguide amplifier with 

controllable transmission. 
A control circuit applies electrical energy to predetermined gates 

to tune the 
optical filter to a desired one or more of a plurality of multiplexed 

input optical 
frequencies. This filter is economical to construct and is useful in 

high capacity, high speed optical communications networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications systems. More 
particularly, this invention relates to integrated optical filters used in optical 
communications systems. The capacity and speed of communications systems may be increased by  
 
transmitting information in optical form over networks composed of optically transmissive 
nodes, fibers, waveguides, and the like. High capacity optical communications systems 
require that many optical signals be frequency division multiplexed in the components of 
an optical network. Receivers must be configured such that a desired optical frequency 
may be retrieved from a group of many multiplexed optical frquencies. This necessitates 
the provision of suitable optical filters which separate desired optical frequencies from a 
frequency division multiplexed plurality of optical frequencies. Until now, there has been 
no convenient approach to filtering unwanted optical frequencies from desired optical 
frequencies. The performance of prior tunable optical filters, based on electro-michanical, 
electro-optic, acousto-optic, and magneto-optic effects, have been limited in terms of 
tuning speed, frequency selectivity, or tuning range. All of these prior devices also have 
been expensive to implement. In accordance with this invention, a rapidly tunable optical filter has been 
developed. The optical filter in accordance with this invention may be based upon 
photonic integrated circuitry which can provide a great deal of frequency selectivity and a 
wide tuning range which can be realized at a cost lower than that associated with 
implementing prior optical filters. In one example of the invention,the inventors have realized that 
integrated optical multiplexers and demultiplexers disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 
5,002,350 and 5,136,671 may be used to create a monolithic fast optical filter having a  
 
wide tuning range. In specific terms, this example of the invention comprises two 
identical 1xN frequency routing devices with their frequency selective ports interconnected. 
Each path connecting the two devices contains an integrated optical amplifier acting as a 
gate. An input signal containing several different frequency channels is divided among 
output ports of the first frequency routing device and directed to respective inputs of the 
second frequency routing device. The second frequency routing device may output any 
selected frequency from the multiplexed combination of frequencies. Any of these 
channels may be selected by opening a
