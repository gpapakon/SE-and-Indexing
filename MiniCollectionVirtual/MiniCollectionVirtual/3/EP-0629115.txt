<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dough mixing, and in 
particular to improvements in dough mixing to maximise the 
utilisation of ascorbic acid as a bread improver. The baking industry makes use of improvers for the 
control of loaf quality and to enable better production of 
bread using fast processes in modern highly mechanised 
plants. The use of improvers is not exclusive to large 
scale production, though the subject of this invention 
applies more to large scale than any other. On 1st April 1990 permission to continue to use the 
improver potassium bromate was withdrawn by the U.K. 
Government. A similar action has either already taken 
place in other developed countries or could do so in the 
foreseeable future. Bromate was a very versatile improver, acting under 
all the conditions commonly in use for breadmaking. In 
particular, it did not require to be converted into 
another compound to work as an improver, it was unaffected 
by the atmosphere in the mixing machine bowl and there was 
synergism between it and ascorbic acid, the other most 
widely used improver. The U.K. baking industry now has a choice of only 
three oxidising improvers, ascorbic acid, azodicarbonamide 
and chlorine dioxide (a gas treatment used only 
occasionally at the end of flour milling). Ascorbic acid, 
which is vitamin C, is the preferred improver, it is the 
only improver allowed in many countries, including all of 
the EC. However, it has characteristics which are 
difficult to deal with in some breadmaking circumstances.  
 
During mixing air is incorporated into the dough, and the 
oxygen in the air converts the ascorbic acid to 
dehydroascorbic acid, which is the true oxidising 
improver. Industrial bakers now have breadmaking problems 
which are caused by insufficient improvement from ascorbic 
acid. Though azodicarbonamide is an alternative to 
ascorbic acid, it is generally less acceptable to 
consumers and more difficult to control in the bakery 
because of its rapid and powerful improver action. Some 
bakers choose not to use azodicarbonamide. Improver 
chlorine dioxide is very weak, cannot be applied at the 
bakery and could not, on its own, provide all the improver 
function required. The consequences of sub-optimal oxidising improver 
action are lower loaf volume, increased firmness of the 
whole loaf and slice (interpreted by consumers as 
staleness), duller crumb colour and less acceptable eating 
quality. The extent of the problem is widespread within 
the UK and will affect breadmaking in all countries using

<CLAIMS>
A dough mixing method for use in breadmaking, which 
comprises mixing together dough ingredients, including 

ascorbic acid as an improver, in the presence of air or an 
oxygen-containing gas, the mixing providing sufficient 

mechanical energy for a sufficient time to develop the 
gluten in the dough, characterised in that excess pressure 

is applied to the atmosphere around the dough during a 
first phase of the mixing, and then a reduced pressure is 

applied during a second phase. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the total 
energy provided by the mixing is from 5 to 20 Wh/kg of 

dough over a total mixing time of from 1 to 6 minutes. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which the 
first and second phase of mixing each last for 1 to 3 

minutes. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, in which 
the pressure applied during the first phase is in the 

range of from 1.05 Bar to 3.0 Bar. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which 
the pressure applied during the second phase is in the 

range of from 0.5 Bar to 0.25 Bar. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, in which 
ascorbic acid is the sole oxidising improver in the dough 

and the mixing is carried out in the presence of air.
