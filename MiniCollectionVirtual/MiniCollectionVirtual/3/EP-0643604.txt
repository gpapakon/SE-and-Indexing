GOLF EQUIPMENTFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to golf equipment and its use whilst playing golf and in particular to pitch-mark repairing equipment foreseen with means for indicating elapse of a specific time period.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONBecause of the distraction to a golfer which can be caused by wearing a wristwatch due to either the reflection from the watch face or its movement on the wrist when playing a shot, most serious players never wear a watch. Even those that do wear one often find it difficult to use when dressed for cold or rainy weather.One solution to overcome this difficulty is proposed inUS-A-4766611, whereby a watch is attached to a golf glove around the Velcro flap which is used to fasten the glove.Such a solution as in the above document however, is far from ideal since about 30 percent of golfers do not wear a glove and, for those that do, the reflection which can be caused in the face of the watch can be particularly annoying when taking a stance to hit the ball or even more so when trying to putt the ball, when many players still do not remove their glove. More importantly, the addition of the watch element to the glove, even when it is integral, produces a stiffening of the glove fastening flap which does not allow the fastening flap to adapt fully to the shape of the back of the hand, as would a normal golf glove, which causes a disturbance as the player is very much aware of the presence of the watch unit. 

Another problem that has arisen in recent years is that golf courses are becoming ever more crowded as the popularity of the game increases. Hence to be able to get the maximum number of players on a golf course during one day, the avoidance of slow play is very important. A player who loses his ball after hitting it is allowed a maximum of five minutes to search for it, to give him a fair chance of locating it but without slowing down play unduly. To avoid slow play this rule must be strictly adhered to, although the disadvantages of wearing a wrist watch or a golf glove with an attached or integral watch face are evident from the above explanation. Additionally, to carry a watch in a golf bag is inconvenient since it may be difficult to easily locate or may not be readily at hand if the player is not next to his golf bag when assisting to search for a player's ball. Carrying it in a trouser or shirt pocket is also not ideal, especially as players already have a pitch- mark repairer, tees, pencil and maybe other implements in their pockets. Even

Claims
1. A pitch mark repair tool, said repair tool being foreseen with a timing device (2) , c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said timing device (2) comprises a stop-watch which has means (4, 14) for indicating elapse of a specific time period.
2. A pitch mark repair tool according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said specific time period is set to five minutes.
3. A pitch mark repair tool according to either of claims 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that means (4, 14) are provided for producing a detectable signal upon elapse of said specific time period.
4. A pitch mark repair tool according to any preceding claim, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said stop-watch (2, 12) is electronic and provided with a display panel.
5. A pitch mark repair tool according to any preceding claim, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said timing device is foreseen with means of adjustment (5, 15, 35) allowing further different time periods to be indicated.
6. A pitch mark repair tool according to any preceding claim, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said timing device has two operating elements (5, 15, 35), one of these being for actuating starting of the specific time period.
7. A pitch mark repair tool according to any preceding claim, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said timing 


device is provided with operating elements (5, 15, 35) which are recessed with respect to the surface of the repair tool and which are of such a size and shape that they can only be operated by using narrow means, such as the edge of a finger nail or the tip of a pencil or pen, so that accidental operation is avoided.
*
8. A pitch mark repair tool according to any preceding claim, wherein said pitch mark repair tool consists of two pieces said first piece being constituted by said timing device (12) arranged in a housing (13) and said second piece being a body portion (11) of said pitch mark repair tool, said second piece having a recess therein for detachably receiving said housing (13) of said first piece.
9. A pitch mark repair tool according to any of claims 4 to 8, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said display panel is provided with tell-tale means (7, 17) such as a dot for example, which indicate if there has been an interruption in said specific time period after actuation of said timing device.
10. The combination of a pitch mark repair tool for repairing pitch marks made in golf greens and a sheath (20) , said sheath being shaped for receiving said repair tool (33) , wherein either said sheath or said pitch mark repair tool is foreseen with a stop watch (32) which, after actuation, can indicate elapse of a specific time period.
11. A method of achieving more correct play in golf whereby, in the event of a suspected lost ball, a stopÂ¬ watch on pitch mark repair equipment is actuated such that after elapse of a specific time period allowed for looking for a lost ball, a detectable signal is emitted.
