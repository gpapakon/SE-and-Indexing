<ABSTRACT>
In the two-bed flat knitting machine, there are provided for the control of sinkers arranged between the needles separate sinker control devices with device bodies (11) which can be releasably fastened laterally to the machine slide and each extend only over the effective range of a cam system (S) and the control parts (10, 21) of which are designed so that, in the event of a reversal of the slide stroke, they are adjusted automatically into an operative position or position of rest.

A two-bed flat bed knitting machine having in its needle
beds (12, 13) longitudinally displaceable needles (16/17) and

sinkers (19) which are arranged pivotally between the needles,
are actuable by the machine carriage (14/1, 14/2) and have a

projection (19.1) which may be moved into the comb gap between
the needle beds (12, 13), characterized in that the sinkers (19)

are controlled by separate devices (10) which may be fixed to the
machine carriage (14/1, 14/2) in laterally detachable manner, of

which the length does not exceed in any case the operative length
of a cam system (S), which have control-cam parts (20, 21) for

control feet (19.2) of the sinkers (19), and of which one may be
selectively associated with each cam system (S) of the machine

carriage (14).
A flat bed knitting machine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the sinker-control device (10) has a guide

path (31) for control feet (19.2) of the sinkers (19), which path
is delimited on the one hand by two cam bars (20, 21) which

follow one another in the feed-through direction and are coupled
to one another for the purpose of performing adjusting movements

which are directed in mutual opposition and perpendicular to the
feed-through direction of the machine carriage (14), and on the

other hand by two metal guide plates (29, 30) which are spring-loaded
at one side and are likewise movable perpendicular to the

feed-through direction.
A flat bed knitting machine according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that both cam bars (20, 21) of the sinker-control

device (10) may be linked to the device body (11) by way
of double-ended guide rods (22, 23) such that they may be moved

parallel, and are in addition coupled to one another by means of
a guide rod (24).
A flat bed knitting machine according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the cam bars (20, 21) may be reversed

automatically as a result of frictional forces coming from the
needle beds (12, 13) and/or the control feet (19.2) of the

sinkers (19) when the carriage travel is reversed.
A flat bed knitting machine according to one of Claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the maximum adjustment distance of

at least one of the cam bars (20, 21) may be adjusted
perpendicular to the feed-through direction by means of at least

one eccentric body (26).
A flat bed knitting machine according to one of Claims 1
to 5, characterized in that both the two cam bars (20, 21) and

the two metal guide plates (29, 30), which are spring-loaded at
one side, have at their ends run-on ramp faces (20.1, 21.1; 29.1,

30.1) for the control feet (19.2) of the sinkers (19).
