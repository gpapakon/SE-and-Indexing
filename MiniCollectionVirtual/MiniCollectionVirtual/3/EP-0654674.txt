<ABSTRACT>
A cable management system provides routing of 
wired services between service lines (16) and user lines 

(18). Each service line (16) enters the cable management 
system at a service termination unit circuit card (22) 

which also holds a portion of a crosspoint switch matrix. 
Each user line (18) enters the system at a line 

termination unit circuit card (20). The service 
termination unit circuit cards (22) are all mounted to 

connectors (36) on a first side of a centerplane board 
(24) and the line termination unit circuit cards (20) are 

mounted to connectors (36) on the other side of the 
centerplane board (24). Pins (37) extending through the 

centerplane board (24) interconnect the connectors (36,37) on the 
opposed sides of the centerplane board (24) so that any 

service line (16) can be connected to any user line (18). A 
system controller card (26) mounted to the centerplane 

board (24) communicates with the circuit cards via a bus 
on the centerplane board (24). Each of the termination unit 

circuit cards (22) has a test port connector (204) for 
communication with a line tester, and a switch 

bank (206) for selectively connecting each of the 
lines on that card (22) to the test port connector (204). The line 

tester may either be a handheld unit or be permanently 
installed as part of the cable management system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cable management system 
which provides routing of telephony, low and high speed 
data, power and video, between service lines and user 
lines under computer control and, more particularly, to 
such a system wherein individual testing of the user and 
service lines can be effected in a single-ended manner 
from the cable management system without disconnecting 
any of the lines from the cable management system. When wiring a commercial building, it is 
conventional that all of the services carried by wire, 
such as telephony, low and high speed data, power and 
video, enter the building for termination at respective 
patch panels. The patch panels are typically located 
within wiring closets and include a first array of 
terminations for the service lines which enter the 
building and a second array of terminations for the user 
lines which extend within the building to various user 
stations. Within each patch panel, the connections 
between the service lines and the user lines are made 
manually via jumper wires extending between the first 
array of terminations and the second array of 
terminations. In an ideal situation, records would be 
maintained as to where each wire goes within the 
building and to what it is connected. However, since 
the real world is not ideal, such records are not always 
properly maintained. In addition, wires are often 
tagged at the patch panels and the tags are lost or 
become outdated because of lack of updating. Therefore, 
when a technician is given a service order to add, move 
or change a connection, the technician must first 
determine exactly which physical wires are involved. 
This has proven to be a very time consuming and labor 
intensive chore. It has been proposed to provide a 
cable management system with automatic record keeping 
capability.  The proposed cable management system is interposed 
between a plurality of service lines and a plurality of 
user lines and includes a plurality of line termination 
unit circuit cards which provide connections to the user 
lines and a plurality of service termination unit 
circuit cards which provide connections to the service 
lines. Controllable switching means are coupled between 
the terminations to the user lines and the service lines 
for selectively providing physical electrical 
connections between selected ones of the service lines 
and selected ones of the user lines. A controller is 
provided to control the switching means to selectively 
make and open connections between the
