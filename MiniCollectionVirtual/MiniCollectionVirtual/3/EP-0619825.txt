<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing enteric-coated oral drugs 
containing acid-unstable compounds, in particular an enteric-coated oral drug prepared 
in the form of acid-stable dosage units as inclusion complex formed by reacting 
benzimidazole derivative, acid-unstable compound, with cyclodextrin in alkaline 
solution. Acid-unstable compounds. especially the benzimidazole compounds, are easily 
discolored and degraded under acidic and neutral conditions. For example, 
omeprazole, a benzimidazole derivative, has half-life of 10 minutes in medium of 
below pH 4, but 18 hours at pH 6.8 and about 300 days at pH 11. Omeprazole has 
been reported to be stable in alkaline condition [Pilbrant Å and Cederberg C. Scand. J. 
Gastroenterology, Suppl. 108, 113-120(1985)]. The acid-unstable compounds when 
exposed to the environment also get discolored and degraded by getting in contact with 
moisture and organic solvents. In therapeutically using the acid-unstable compounds, 
omeprazole and benzimidazole derivatives, which show a powerful inhibitory actions 
against secretion of gastric-juice and can be used for the treatment of gastric and 
duodenal ulcers, it is very important that an oral dosage form of them must be protected 
from the acidic gastric-juice in order to be absorbed in small intestinal without 
degradation. Methods for stabilizing the acid-unstable compound, in particular 
omeprazole has been known to be as follows ; Omeprazole is combined with alkaline 
salt such as Na+, K+, Mg+2, Ca+2 and so on to maintain the stability for compound 
itself. PCT Publication No. 86-00913(PCT/EP 85/00371) discloses to form a stable 
complex by mixing and reacting omeprazole with β -cyclodextrin in 96% ethanol and 
cooling the reactant. The latter process seems to have the problem as the reaction is conducted at a 
temperature 25 ∼ 38°C for 15 hours in ethanol, during the reaction itself omeprazole 
can get discolored and degraded. Furthermore, it is difficult to expect the formation  
 
of inclusion compound because both omeprazole and cyclodextrin are dispersed in the 
reaction as solid particles, not dissolved. For forming an inclusion compound of 
cyclodextrin, the reaction must be carried out in presence of water molecules [K. Hara, 
H. Hashimoto, J. Jpn. Soc. Starch. Sci., 32(2) 152-161(1986)]. Therefore, the latter 
method is not expected to give inclusion compound since the above reacting condition has 
not been considered. On the other hand, Unexamined Korean Patent No. 87-9718 and
