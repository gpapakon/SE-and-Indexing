<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cationic electrodeposition coating 
composition. More particularly, it relates to a cationic electrodeposition 
coating composition which satisfies both corrosion resistance when baked 
at low-temperature, and pigment dispersion stability. A cationic electrodeposition coating composition providing a 
corrosion-resistant coating to articles to be coated such as automobiles, 
etc. is an aqueous dispersion which is prepared by dispersing a cationic 
resin, a curing agent, and a pigment paste containing a pigment dispersed 
in a pigment dispersing resin, in an aqueous medium. The cationic 
electrodeposition coating composition is electrocoated on an article and 
then baked at a temperature of more than 160 °C to cure the coated film on 
the article. Recently, in order to reduce energy cost, it has been requested for the 
above cationic electrodeposition coating composition to be baked at a 
relatively low temperature (i.e. less than 160°C) for a short period of time. 
On the other hand, it is necessary that the cationic electrodeposition 
coating composition has pigment dispersion stability, as a matter of course. 
It is difficult to satisfy both these two performances in the prior art. For example, when using a resin containing a quaternary ammonium 
salt as the cationic pigment dispersing resin, the resulting coating 
composition is superior in pigment dispersion stability, but corrosion 
resistance is not sufficient when baked at a low-temperature of 160 °C or 
less.  It is also suggested that a tertiary sulfonium salt is used as the cationic 
pigment dispersing resin. When using this cationic pigment dispersing 
resin, the resulting coating composition is superior in corrosion resistance 
when baked at the low-temperature but is inferior in pigment dispersion 
stability, and stability of the paint bath is not sufficient. Further, there is also suggested a pigment dispersing resin which 
contains a tertiary amine salt neutralized with acid, but it has the same 
disadvantage as that of the cationic pigment dispersing resin containing 
the above sulfonium salt. The main object of the present invention is to provide a cationic 
electrodeposition coating composition which satisfies both pigment 
dispersion stability and corrosion resistance when cured at a low 
temperature of 160°C or less. This object as well as other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following 
description. That is, the present
