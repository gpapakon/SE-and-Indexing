<ABSTRACT>
An image projection system for projecting an image 
obtained on an image field onto a screen through a projection 

lens comprises a plurality of spacers (5a,5b) overlaid with each other 
and arranged between the image field and the lens, each of the 

spacers having first and second surfaces through which the 
image is projected and an angle defined by the first and second 

surfaces being a predetermined value, an adjusting device (6a,6b) for 
each of the spacers for adjusting a rotational angle of the 

spacers on a rotational axis substantially parallel to an image 
projection direction, and a fixing device for fixing the 

plurality of spacers relative to the image field and the lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image projection
systems and, more particularly, to an image projection system
of a spacer type which includes spacers to project an image
obtained on an image field onto a screen correctly.FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings schematically
shows an image projection system which includes a CRT (cathode
ray tube) 1, a lens 2 and a screen 3 disposed with an
illustrated positional relationship. The image projection
system shown in FIG. 1 can project an image obtained on an
image field onto a screen insofar as the CRT 1 and the lens 2
are properly placed relative to the screen 3. Therefore, if
the lens 2 is disposed at a predetermined position (angle)
determined by the image field of the image projection system,
such as the CRT 1 and the screen 3, it is possible to correctly
project an image onto the screen 3. There is an image
projection system of a spacer type which includes spacers
interposed in respective areas between the lens 2 and the image
field of the CRT 1 to provide a necessary angle.If the image projection system of the spacer type
includes only one pattern of optical system, then it is
sufficient that the image field of the CRT 1 and the lens 2
are fixed at a predetermined angle with rigid spacers.
However, when an image projection system is set in an actual
practice, a relationship between the surface of the screen 3
and the image field of the CRT 1 is changed variously with a
combination of a screen size and an incident angle a (see FIG.
2A). As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, reference symbol δV
represents an angle (declination) in the vertical direction
formed by the video screen of the CRT 1 and the end face of
the lens 2 as seen from the side surface direction of the set
position of the CRT 1 and the lens 2 (see FIG. 2A). Reference
symbol δH represents an angle (declination) in the horizontal
direction formed by the video surface of the CRT 1 and the end
face of the lens 2 as seen from the upper surface direction of
the set position of the CRT 1 and the lens 2 (see FIG. 2B).At that time, a center A of the screen 3 and an optical
axis center B are not always coincident. In general, if the
size of the screen 3 is large, then the angle δH is small. If
the size of the screen 3 is small, then the angle δH is large.
The incident angle α is changed variously in respective cases.If all combinations of the screen sizes and the
incident angles α are realized by the spacer, there should be
prepared spacers of various proper sizes, which cannot be made
in actual

An image projection system including a projection lens (2) for projecting onto a
screen (3) an image in an image field produced by an image producing device (1), the

system comprising:

a plurality of spacers (5a,5b) arranged between said device (1) and said lens
(2) one after the other along an axis (7) substantially parallel to the optical axis of said

lens (2), each spacer having a first front surface facing said device (1) and a second
front surface facing said lens (2) such that light to form said image passes through said

first and second front surfaces of each spacer (5a,5b,6a,6b) and is projected onto said
screen (3); and fixing means (8) for fixing said plurality of spacers between said device

(1) and said lens (2); characterised in that:
said plurality of spacers are directly overlaid with each other so that their
corresponding front surfaces contact with each other, with said lens (2) and with said

device (1);
said first and second front surfaces of each spacer (5a,5b,6a,6b) are inclined to
each other by a predetermined angle;
said spacers (5a,5b,6a,6b) are mounted so as to be rotatable about said axis
(7) being substantially parallel to the optical axis of said projection lens (2); and that
said fixing means (8) are provided for fixing said plurality of spacers against
rotation about said axis relative to said device and said lens.
An image projection system according to claims 1 wherein said image field is
the screen of a cathode ray tube (1).
An image projection system according to claim 1 or 2 further comprising guide
means (6a,6b) surrounding each spacer to support and to guide them rotatably.
