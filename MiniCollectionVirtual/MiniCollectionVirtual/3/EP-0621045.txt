<ABSTRACT>
Novel catheters and tubing for medical applications can be produced from copolymers of olefins and unsaturated carboxylic acids whose melting range, measured by the DSC method, begins at temperatures below 32@C. These copolymers have an ethylene content of from 60 to 94.5% by weight, a content of comonomers from the group consisting of C3-C22- alpha -olefins, C4-C6-vinyl esters and C4-C8-(meth)acrylates of from 5 to 39.5% by weight and a content of unsaturated carboxylic acids of from 0.5 to 10% by weight, where the percentages are based on the total weight of the copolymer. From 10 to 100% of the carboxyl groups from the unsaturated acids have been neutralised by inorganic cations.
