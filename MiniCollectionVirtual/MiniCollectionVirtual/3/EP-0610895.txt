<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface sizing composition 
useful in papermaking processes. In the manufacture of ordinary paper and paperboard, "sizing" is 
effected in order to provide the products with resistance to blotting, 
water resistance, waterproofness, and the like. Such sizing includes 
"internal sizing" in which a sizing agent is added to a furnish during 
the papermaking process before a fiber sheet is formed and "surface 
sizing" in which a sizing agent is applied on the surface of formed 
fiber sheet. In internal sizing, there is employed an acid sizing in which 
sizing is carried out in a pH range of 4.5-6.5 using rosin sizing agents 
and crude aluminum sulfate. There is also employed, with increasing 
popularity, a neutral or alkaline papermaking technique using calcium 
carbonate as a filler. Here, paper is made in a pH range of 6.5-9 where 
rosin and alum do not work well, and are sized with ketene dimer 
compounds, substituted cyclic dicarboxylic acid anhydride compounds, 
copolymers of a cationic monomer and a hydrophobic monomer, cationized 
petroleum resins, cationized aliphatic amides and the like. Among 
these, aqueous dispersions of ketene dimer compounds are most widely 
used because of their superior sizing effect. Internal sizing, despite widespread popularity, suffers from the 
disadvantage of not fully staying with the cellulose fibers during the 
dewatering phase of the papermaking operation, thus incurring 
significant losses. In so-called closed-loop papermaking operations, 
the chemicals lost during the dewatering phase are trapped with the 
water and recirculated to all phases of the papermaking operation.  
 
Often, hydrolyzed diketene by-products deposit on various parts of the 
paper machine, sometimes redepositing onto the paper itself as 
contamination, or onto the paper machine causing buildup and ultimately 
down-time for cleanup. The surface application of hydrophobes is advantageous in that all 
of the sizing agent is retained on the paper. However, ketene dimer 
compounds are inherently reactive with water and are difficult to 
provide as stable aqueous dispersions. It is very difficult to provide 
an aqueous dispersion sizing agent which is both stable at high 
temperatures and mechanically stable. To the inventors' knowledge, 
ketene dimer, by itself, is not used as a surface size on a commercial 
scale. In surface sizing, the sizing agent is, on some occasions, 
required to provide the paper with surface bonding strength and good 
printability in
