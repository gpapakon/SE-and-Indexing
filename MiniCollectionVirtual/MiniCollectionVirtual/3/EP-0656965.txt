<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to finish compositions for use with 
synthetic filaments and relates more particularly to low fume finish compositions 
suitable for wet air-jet texturing and synthetic filaments coated with such 
compositions. Synthetic fiber producers provide the textile industry with a wide variety 
of continuous filament yarn products. These differ in polymer type, orientation, 
denier, denier per filament, luster, cross-section, dyeability, and other 
distinguishing properties. Many of these commercially available yarns would 
otherwise be desirable as feed yarns for air-jet texturing but they contain 
conventional finish compositions developed for other kinds of processing such as 
false-twist texturing, weaving, and knitting. Unfortunately, yarns with conventional finish compositions are not well-suited 
for the special needs of wet air-jet texturing so they can cause serious 
quality and productivity problems. Critical among these is the build-up of 
deposits in the air-bulking jet. The build-up of deposits initially reduces bulk 
level and bulk uniformity, reduces threadline tension uniformity, and ultimately 
causes threadline breaks and stringup difficulty. Conventional finishes when used 
on yarns for wet air-jet texturing also cause environmental and occupational 
health problems in hot processing during yarn manufacture by releasing vapor 
and aerosol fumes into the workplace and the environment. The invention provides a lubricating finish composition and synthetic 
filaments coated with the composition. The composition of the invention 
comprises: 
about 60 to about 98.9, preferably 65 to about 95, weight percent 
nonionic emulsifier having a melting point less than about 25°C; about 1 to about 39.9 weight percent lubricant having at least 29 carbon 
atoms and a melting point less than about 25°C; and about 0.1 to about 15 weight percent anionic surfactant. Preferably, the finish composition has an acid value of less than about 8, 
most preferably less than about 4. In a preferred form of the invention, the nonionic emulsifier is selected 
from the class consisting of polyoxyalkylene condensation products having a 
lipophilic portion derived from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Most preferably, 
the polyoxyalkylene condensation products are of natural and synthetic aliphatic  
 
monohydric alcohols and natural and synthetic aliphatic monobasic carboxylic 
acids with a number average molecule weight of at least about 600 amu. The 
lubricant is preferably selected from the
