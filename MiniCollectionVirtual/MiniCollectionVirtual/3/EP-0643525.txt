<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus having a printer which can 
operate independently. If it is designated to use the 

printer as a printer, whether or not the memory of the 
facsimile controller has a predetermined amount or more 

empty area. If the memory has a sufficient amount of 
empty area, the memory is used as a print buffer for 

temporarily storing print data from a computer connected 
to the printer. On the other hand, if the memory does 

not have the predetermined amount or more empty area, 
the printer is directly connected to the computer, and 

the printer is used as a printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a facsimile apparatus
which can be used as a printer and a printing control
method for the apparatus.Small-sized and low-price facsimile apparatuses,
comprising an ink-jet printer as a recorder, capable of
printing on ordinary paper have been developed. The
printer unit of these apparatuses may be directly
connected to a computer and used as an independent
printer. In this case, the printer unit does not
operate under the control of the controller of the
facsimile main body. It comprises a CPU and a RAM as a
printer controller so as to directly receive data from
the computer and independently perform printing.Accordingly, when this facsimile apparatus operates
as an independent printer, the memory for the facsimile
controller is not used at all. That is, the hardware
resource of the facsimile apparatus cannot be
effectively utilized.The present invention has been made in
consideration of the above situation, and has as a
concern to provide a facsimile apparatus and a printing
control method which effectively utilizes a facsimile
memory and performs printing.Another concern of the present invention is to
provide a facsimile apparatus and printing control
method which uses a facsimile controller memory as a
print buffer when the apparatus functions as a printer,
thus effectively utilizes the system resource for high-speed
printing.Further concern of the present invention is to
provide a facsimile apparatus and printing control
method which, in a printer mode where the printer unit
is used as an independent printer, if a facsimile signal
is received, automatically switches from the printer
mode to a facsimile mode for facsimile reception.Still another concern of the present invention is to
provide a facsimile apparatus and printing control
method which enables facsimile/printer mode instruction
using a few keys.Further concern of the present invention is to
provide a facsimile apparatus used as both a facsimile
apparatus and an independent printer, and a printing
control method for the apparatus. European Patent Specification No. EP-A-0519253
discloses a facsimile apparatus capable of being
connected to a personal computer so that it can function
as a printer for the computer.United States Patent Specification No. US-A-5072303
also discloses a facsimile apparatus capable of being
connected to a personal computer, the facsimile apparatus
having a memory for receiving data from a PC port and a
FAX port.However, neither of these prior documents solve the
problem with which the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus, comprising:

a printer unit (111) for printing in a first mode
data based on a received facsimile signal and in a second

mode an image signal from an external device (120);
a memory (102) for storing data corresponding to the
received facsimile signal;
control means (101) for controlling facsimile
operation of the facsimile apparatus;
connection means (116, 117) for receiving the input
from the external device and to connect the received

input to the printer unit; and
designation means (107) for designating either of
said first mode or said second mode;

   characterised by further comprising:

judgment means (S9) for judging whether or not the
memory (102) has at least a predetermined amount of empty

area,
wherein in the second mode as designated by said
designation means and in the case where said judgment

means judges that the memory (102) has at least the
predetermined amount of empty area, said control means

controls the memory to use the memory as a buffer for
storing data corresponding to the image signal from the

external device and the printer unit performs printing
in accordance with the data stored in the memory, whilst 

in the case where said judgment means judges that the
memory does not have at least the predetermined amount

of empty area, said control means causes said connection
means to connect the printer unit to the external device

and the printer unit performs printing in accordance with
the data from the external device without using the

memory.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
designation means is adapted to designate either of first

or the second mode so that the printer unit is used as
an output unit of the facsimile apparatus in the second

mode.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
said designation means has a plurality of keys having

functions to be changed in accordance with the first and
second mode.
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised by
further comprising display means for displaying the

functions of the plurality of keys of said designation
means.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
characterised by further comprising:


reception means (105,106) for receiving a facsimile 
signal; and
means (101) for changing for, if said reception
means receives the facsimile signal in the second mode

where the printer unit is used as the printer by
designation of said designation means, changing the

second mode to the first mode in which the printer unit
is used as the output unit of the facsimile apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in
that if said judgment means judges that the memory has

the predetermined amount or more empty area, said control
means uses the memory as a print buffer for storing print

data from the external device, and controls the apparatus
to sequentially output the print data stored in the

memory to the printer unit to perform printing.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the printer unit is an ink-jet

printer.
A method of printing control for a facsimile
apparatus having a printer (111) which can print based

on a received facsimile signal in a first mode and based
on an image signal from an external device (120) in a

second mode, comprising:

a designation step of designating either the first
or the second mode, the facsimile apparatus having a 

memory (102) that in the first mode stores the received
facsimile signal;

characterised by further comprising:

a judgment step of, if the second mode is designated in said
designation step, judging whether or not the memory of the facsimile

apparatus has at least a predetermined amount of empty area; and
a control step of, if it is judged in said judgement
step that the memory (102) has at least the predetermined

amount of empty area, using the memory (102) as a buffer
for storing data corresponding to the image signal from

the external device, while if it is judged in said
judgement step that the memory (102) does not have at

least the predetermined amount of empty area, controlling
the printer (111) to print an image based on the image

signal from the external device (120) without using the
memory.
A method according to claim 8, characterised by
further comprising:


reception step of receiving a facsimile signal; and
a step of changing the second mode to the first mode
where the printer unit is used as the output unit of the

facsimile apparatus, if the facsimile signal is received
in the second mode when the printer unit is being used

as the printer.
A method according to either of claims 8 or 9 wherein
a plurality of keys are provided, the functions carried

out by the keys being changed in accordance with the
designated mode. 
A control method according to claim 10, further
comprising a display step of displaying the functions of

the plurality of keys.
