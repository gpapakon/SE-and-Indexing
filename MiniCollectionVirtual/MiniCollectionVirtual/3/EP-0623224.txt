<ABSTRACT>
Retroreflective plastic articles, namely plastic fencing, and a method of preparation thereof by embedding glass beads in thermoplastic materials such as high density polyethylene (HDPE). The glass beads (30) are heated and the thermoplastic material (12) is softened by contact with the heated beads (30). Pressure is applied to the beads to embed them into the substrate at least 50 % of their diameter but no greater than 70 % of their diameter. No covering layer is necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GLASS BEADS EMBEDDED INTO HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE SUBSTRATE FOR USE AS RETROREFLECTIVE ARTICLES. NAMELY FENCING Background Of the Invention1. Field Of The InventionThis invention relates to retroreflective articles, and more particularly to fencing made of a high density polyethylene substrate wfth reflective glass beads, sometimes referred to as microspheres embedded therein.2. Description Of The Related ArtThe use of glass beads embedded in plastic is known in the art. U.S. Patent 4,766,032 disclosed "Reflective Transfer Sheeting and Method of Making the Same" wherein glass beads are embedded in a thermoplastic composite sheet. However, they are not embedded directly into the substrate as in the case of the present invention nor are they embedded 50-70% of the diameter of the beads. The extent of embedding is referred to only in generalterms (See columns 3, lines 50-55).U.S. Patent 4,950,525 relates to "Elastomeric Reflective Sheeting" in which beads are embedded in a polymeric sheet. However, the sheet is then covered with a covering layer 19c (see column 5, lines 25-32 for a description of the final product). U.S. Patent 4,104,102 is somewhat similar to 4,950,525 in that the glass beads are covered with a sealing layer.U.S. Patent 3,873,390 makes use of glass beads (column 13) which are adhered with an adhesive (Fig. 5). 

 U.S. Patent 4,505,967 describes retroreflectrve sheeting in whichthe microspheres are embedded into a first polymeric layer to less than one- half the average diameter of the microspheres and a film is laminated to themicrosphere covered surface of the first layer.U.S. Patent 4,569,857 describes a method of preparingretroreflectϊve sheeting in which a binder material is required.U.S. Patent 4,648,932 also relates to retroreflective sheetingwherein microspheres are embedded into a first polymeric layer to less than one-half their diameter and a covering film is placed over the microspheres.U.S. Patent 4,721 ,649 is similar to this patent.U.S. Patent 4,876,141 relates to a technique in which a mixture ofmaterials including the glass beads or microspheres are formed into a sheet, the beads having a variety of exposed surfaces.U.S. Patent 4,897,136 describes retroreflective sheeting wherein a cover film is utilized over microspheres.U.S. Patent 4,921 ,754 is of interest in that microspheres areembedded as to their lower portions only in a base layer and then coveredwith a surface layer.U.S. Patent 5,039,557 describes the use of preheated glassbeads in pavement marking material.

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A reflective article comprising a plastic substrate having a plurality of glass beads embedded in the surface thereof to a depth greater than about 50% of the diameter of the beads and less than about 70% of the
diameter of the beads.
2. The article of claim 1 in which the plastic is high density polyethylene.
3. The article of claim 1 in which the plastic is 90% High density polyethylene and 10% polypropylene.
4. The article of claim 1 in which the article is a plastic fence.
5. The article of claim 1 in which the glass beads are lead free and of optical quality.
6. The article of claim 1 in which the beads are of high refractive index. 7. A method of preparing a glass bead reflective surface on
a plastic substrate comprising: a) providing a plastic substrate; b) providing a plurality of glass beads; c) heating the beads to a temperature above the softening temperature of the plastic; d) spreading the beads over the substrate surface; and e) applying pressure to the beads while hot so as to embed them in the surface. 


 8. The method of claim 7 in which the pressure and temperature are such as to allow the beads to be embedded to a depth of at least about 50% of the diameter of the beads and not greater than 70% of the diameter of the beads and to cause molten flow of the plastic around the beads to lock them in the plastic.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the beads are applied to the surface of the plastic substrate by a deflector so the beads are evenly dispersed.
10. The method of claim 7 wherein a load is applied to the glass beads by a nip roll.
11. The method of claim 7 wherein the plastic substrate is a
plastic fence.
12. The method of claim 9 wherein the beads are dispersed to form reflective strips. F:\WPWORK\L B\PATE TS\APP\3728-APP.C30
