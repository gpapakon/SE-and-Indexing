<ABSTRACT>
An automatic document feeder includes a controlling means for 
actuating and controlling a forwarding means (38), a document 

separating means (60), a resist roller pair (114), and a 
document conveying means (100). In response to a copy start 

signal, the controlling means energizes the pressing 
mechanism of the forwarding means (38), actuates the 

forwarding roller, and actuates the document separating means 
(60) to carry the document laid on the document bearing means 

(18). During the carriage of the document to bring its front 
end to the resist roller pair (114), the controlling means 

deenergizes the pressing mechanism of the forwarding means 
(38) at least once for a predetermined time during a period 

from the arrival of the front end of the document at the 
document separating means (60) until its arrival at the 

resist roller pair (114), thereby releasing the pressure on 
the documents laid on the document bearing means (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic
document feeder to be mounted on a document processor
such as an electrostatic document copying machine or
an image reader.In recent years, with the speeding and
automation of copying, copying machines have used an
automatic document feeder which automatically feeds a
plurality of documents sequentially to a document
setting position on the top of a transparent panel.
Such an automatic document feeder comprises a
document bearing means for bearing documents; a
forwarding means having a forwarding roller for
forwardly delivering the documents borne on the
document bearing means, and a pressing mechanism for
pressing the documents at the time of document
delivery by the forwarding roller; a document
separating means having a paper feed roller disposed
downstream of the forwarding means and rotated in the
direction of conveyance, and a separating mechanism
disposed opposite to the paper feed roller and
operated in a direction opposite to the direction of
conveyance; a resist roller pair disposed downstream
of the document separating means to temporarily stop
the document carried by the paper feed roller and
carry the stopped document toward a transparent panel
of a document processor; and a document conveying
means for conveying the document, carried by the
resist roller pair, to a predetermined position on
the transparent panel and discharging the document
conveyed to the transparent panel. In response to a
copy start signal, the pressing mechanism of the 
forwarding means is energized and the forwarding
roller actuated. Simultaneously, the document
separating means is actuated to carry the front end
of the document borne on the document bearing means
to the resist roller pair.The pressing mechanism of the forwarding
means is energized at the same time as the start of a
copying action, and its energizing lasts for a so-called
temporary paper feed period until the front
end of the document reaches the resist roller pair.
Thus, if two or more documents are borne on the
document bearing means, the second or later document
is stopped by the document separating means. At the
forwarding means, however, such document is about to
be carried toward the document separating means owing
to its friction with the document beneath it which is
being carried by the forwarding roller. On this
occasion, if the document borne on the document
bearing means is thicker than an ordinary document
and has high stiffness, it slips against the lower
document being carried, thus posing no

<CLAIMS>
An automatic document feeder comprising:

document bearing means (18) for bearing documents;
forwarding means (38) having a forwarding roller (40)
for delivering the documents borne on the document

bearing means (18), and a pressing mechanism (44) for
pressing the documents at the time of document

delivery by the forwarding roller (40); document
separating means (60) having a paper feed roller (64)

disposed downstream of the forwarding means (38) and
rotated in the direction of conveyance, and a

separating mechanism (66) disposed opposite to the
paper feed roller (64) and operated in a direction

opposite to the direction of conveyance; a resist
roller pair (114) disposed downstream of the document

separating means (60) to carry the document toward a
transparent panel (8) of a document processor (2); and

document conveying means (100) for conveying the
document, carried by the resist roller pair (114), to

a predetermined position on the transparent panel (8)
and discharging the document conveyed to the

transparent panel;
controlling means (200) for actuating and controlling
the forwarding means (38), the document separating

means (60), the resist roller pair (114), and the
document conveying means (100);
wherein the controlling means (200), in response to a
copy start signal, is adapted to energize the pressing

mechanism (44), actuate the forwarding roller (40),
and actuate the document separating means (60) to 

carry forward the document laid on the document
bearing means (18),

characterized in that

during carriage of the document to bring its front end
to the resist roller pair (114), the controlling means

(200) are adapted to deenergize the pressing mechanism
(44) after the front end of the document passes

through the document separating means (60) and to re-energize
the pressuring mechanism (44) after a

predetermined time period (T
3
).
