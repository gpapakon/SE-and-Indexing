<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a noise 
abating automotive drum brake shoe assembly according 
to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1. For some time automotive manufacturers 
have been aware that the application of disc or 
drum brakes to slow or stop a vehicle may cause a 
significant amount of noise to emanate from the 
vehicle. It has been learned that such noise 
originates at the interface of a brake drum and a 
friction material brake block or at the interface 
of a rotor and the friction material of a disc 
brake pad during the braking application. During 
such application a resonance develops at the 
friction material brake drum or rotor interface 
which may be transmitted through the brake shoe 
assembly, the brake mounting hardware and into the 
suspension to cause objectionable noise to emanate 
from the vehicle. Numerous attempts have been made to 
reduce the resonance vibration imparted during the 
braking operation. In vehicles equipped with disc 
brakes in which a disc brake pad engages a rotor, 
resonant vibrations have been reduced by providing 
a resilient coating at the interface between a 
disc brake pad backing plate and a caliper piston. 
Unfortunately, a conventional drum brake mechanism 
does not lend itself to such a solution. In an 
attempt to reduce the aforementioned resonant 
vibrations it has been the practice to stiffen 
certain brake and suspension system components to 
reduce their susceptibility to developing 
sympathetic resonant vibrations. Attempts to 
stiffen such systems have included casting ribs on 
the exterior surface of a brake drum to stiffen 
the drum, casting brake drums with a heavy ring of 
metal around the edge of the open end of the drum  
 
to stiffen the drum and welding supports on the 
suspension system to more firmly anchor suspension 
components to reduce their ability to transmit and/or 
amplify vibrations. Additionally, heavy rubber bands 
sometimes are secured to the exterior surface of brake 
drums in an attempt to reduce the vibrations transmitted 
therethrough. Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned 
mentions provide a definitive solution to the problem 
applicable to all vehicles. Large vehicles such as trucks and busses are 
particularly susceptible to the generation of excessive 
noise during the braking process and the aforementioned 
attempts to reduce the resonance emanating from the 
brake drum friction material interface have been least 
successful in these applications. The US-A-2 861 964 discloses a molded 
composition

<CLAIMS>
A noise abating automotive drum brake shoe 
assembly (40;60) comprising a metal brake shoe (42;62) 

having a flat, uninterrupted, shoe table (44;64) for 
supporting a friction material brake block (48;68); a 

friction material brake block (48;68) having a pair of 
first side surfaces, a pair of second side surfaces and an 

inside diameter surface (54;82) adapted to engage said shoe 
table (44;64) characterized by at least one groove 

(50,52;70,72,74,76,78,80) formed in the inside diameter 
surface (54;82) of the friction material brake block 

(48;68) and extending from one side surface to the opposite 
side surface adapted to receive an elastomeric sound 

damping material insert (56,58;84,86,88,90,92,94) ; an 
elastomeric sound damping material insert 

(56,58;84,86,88,90,92,94) with a back surface, a front 
surface and two elatomeric side surfaces and having a 

thickness approximately equal to the depth of said groove 
(50,52;70,72,74,76,78,80) inserted within said groove 

(50,52;70,72,74,76,78,80) such that the back and two 
elastomeric side surfaces of said sound damping material 

engage said friction material and wherein said sound 
damping material insert (56,58;84,86,88,90,92,94) is 

clamped between said inside diameter surface groove 
(50,52;70,72,74,76,78,80) and said shoe table (44;64) such 

that the front surface of said material engages said shoe 
table (44;64) to thereby reduce noise causing resonance 

between said brake block (48;68) and said brake shoe 
(42;64) . 
The noise abating automotive drum brake shoe 
assembly (40;60) of claim 1 characterized in that said  

 
elastomeric sound damping material insert 

(56,58;84,86,88,90,92,94) consists of two to fifteen 
percent by weight of cured cashew nut shell resin, from 

five to twenty-five percent by weight of nitrile rubber, 
from eight to thirty percent by weight of a resin binder, 

from four to twenty percent by weight of a fiber selected 
from a group consisting of metal, glass, mineral rock wool 

and refractory and from about five to about eighteen 
percent of a substantially carbon material.
