<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for controlling (setting) the total illumination in a room, which is illuminated from inside and outside, as well as a device for carrying out the process, so that, at the same time, an interior illumination (1) and a dimming device (4) of the room (21) can be controlled (set) by means of a single control system, as a function of a plurality of reference variables (input variables, control variables), preferably of a joint reference variable such as for example the outside luminous intensity (light intensity) (a). The dimming device (4) of the room (21) can be adjusted both automatically and manually. This is achieved, inter alia, in that the control of the interior illumination (1) and of the dimming device (4) is performed automatically in accordance with two independent control functions and the automatic control of the dimming device (4) is interrupted after a manual adjustment of the dimming device (4).
