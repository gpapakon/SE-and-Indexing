<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine for continuous casting, particularly for casting noble metals and/or noble-metal alloys and/or nonferrous metals, with a melting chamber, an energy source for melting the material, with a continuous casting mould and with an extraction device arranged underneath the continuous casting mould. This machine is distinguished by the fact that it has a plurality of melting chambers (6) with the continuous casting mould (3) associated with each melting chamber, the melting chambers being arranged on a common, pivotable support (3).

Apparatus for the continuous casting of noble metals and/or
noble metal alloys and/or non-ferrous metals, having at least one

melting chamber (6), a source of energy for melting the material,
a continuous casting mould (7) and a withdrawal device arranged

beneath the continuous casting mould (7), characterized in that
the apparatus has a plurality of melting chambers (6), in that

these melting chambers (6) are arranged, together with the
respectively associated continuous casting mould (7), on a common

swivellable carrier (3), and in that each melting chamber (6)
with the associated continuous casting mould (7) is swivellable

above a common withdrawal device.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the
melting chambers (6) and/or the continuous casting moulds (7) are

interchangeable.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
a drive device is provided for swivelling the carrier (3).
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
drive device operates by electric motor, in particular is a

stepping motor.
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the source of energy is induction heating

or resistance heating.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
carrier (3) comprises at least two plates (4;5) arranged at a

distance from one another, and an arm (8), the plates (4;5) being
conn
ected to the arm (8), and the melting chambers (6) and the
continuous casting moulds (7) being arranged between the plates

(4;5). 
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the continuous casting moulds (7) have

different cross-sections, formats and numbers of casting bars.
