<ABSTRACT>
A colour-photographic silver-halide material of the negative type in which at least one silver-halide emulsion layer contains a compound of the formula  A-B-(T1)m-(COUP-D)-(T2)n     (I),  where     A is a ballast radical, B is the radical of a compound which reacts during development with elimination of (T1)m-(COUP-D)-(T2)n, T1 and T2 are time-control groups which can be eliminated during development,   m and n are 0 or 1,   COUP is the radical of a tetraequivalent coupler, and   D is a group with affinity to silver, is distinguished by improved sensitivity.

)
n
 
wherein 


A
represents a ballast group, 
B
represents the radical of a compound which reacts 
to release (T
1
)
m
-(COUP-D)-(T
2
)
n
 during development, 
T
1
 and T
2
represent time-regulating units which can be 
released during development, 
m, n
are 0 or 1, 
COUP
represents the radical from a 4-equivalent 
coupler and 
D
represents a group with an affinity for silver. 
Colour photographic silver halide material according 
to claim 1 in which D corresponds to the formulas IIa 

to IIe 

  
 

in which 

Z
1
represents the remaining members for completion 
of a preferably 5 or 6-membered ring which 

contains at least one other hetero-atom such as a 
nitrogen or sulphur atom, 
Z
2
represents the remaining members for completion 
of a preferably 5 or 6-membered ring, 
X
represents -NH
2
, -NHR, -N(R)
2
, -NH-NH
2

to Claim 1, wherein A-B is the radical from a 2-equivalent 

coupler which contains the group (T
1
)
m
-(COUP-D)-(T
2
)
n
 
bonded at the coupling site, which is 

linked to B via the group D which has an affinity for 
silver, wherein COUP-D contains no ballast radicals 

which make it diffusion-resistant. 
Colour photographic silver halide material according 
to Claim 1, wherein the compound of the formula I is 

used in an amount of 0.0005 to 0.05 mmol/m
2
 of 
photographic material.

to Claim 1, which contains at least two red-sensitive 

cyan-coupling silver halide emulsion layers of 
different sensitivity, at least two green-sensitive, 

magenta-coupling silver halide emulsion layers of 
different sensitivity and at least two blue-sensitive 

yellow-coupling silver halide emulsion layers, wherein 
at least one high-sensitivity silver halide emulsion 

layer contains a compound of the formula I.
