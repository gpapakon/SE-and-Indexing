<ABSTRACT>
The gas detector essentially consists of an electrochemical sensor having an input diaphragm 2 through which the measurement gas diffuses onto the sensor surface 9 and there generates an electrical measurement signal correlated with the gas concentration. The input diaphragm 2 is formed by a ceramic membrane which is applied onto a support frame 11 and has a thickness of 0.1  mu m to 20  mu m and at least one through opening 12 with a diameter of 0.1  mu m to 200  mu m. This ceramic membrane 10 is arranged opposite a substantially larger opening 13 in the support frame 11. The thickness of the ceramic membrane is 0.1  mu m to 10  mu m.
