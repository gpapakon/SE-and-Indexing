<ABSTRACT>
It has been discovered that by temporarily blocking one or more natural anticoagulants, such as the activation of intrinsic protein C, subsequent surgical blood loss from a microvascular surgical or traumatic wound can be substantially reduced. Other natural anticoagulants include thrombomodulin, antithrombin III, and tissue factor inhibitor pathway. The effects of protein C blockade were compared to the standard therapy, topical thrombin, and to the experimental topical agent, tissue thromboplastin. Domestic pigs were blindly pretreated with intravenous HPC4 or saline then underwent partial-thickness skin graft harvesting to create a reproducible microvascular wound. It was found that blocking the activation of protein C significantly reduces surgical blood loss compared to saline control animals. Intravenous HPC4 performed equally as well as topical thrombin or tissue thromboplastin. In addition, topical thrombin acted synergistically with HPC4 to further reduce blood.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOCKADE OF PROTEIN C ACTIVATION REDUCES MICROVASCULAR SURGICAL BLOOD LOSSBackground of the InventionMicrovascular (capillary) bleeding is a significant source of blood loss in many conditions including bleeding liver surfaces, skin graft donor sites, inflamed visceral surfaces, and burns. Because of the diffuse nature of this type of bleeding, vessel ligation or electrocautery is not a feasible method of hemostasis. Currently, the dominant method of treatment of this type of bleeding is topical thrombin and direct pressure applied to the bleeding surface.However, during traumatic cerebral, retroperitoneal, and pelvic hemorrhage, surgical exposure of microvascular bleeding sites can actually worsen the hemorrhage, making topical agents undesirable. Additionally, bovine antithrombin antibodies have been reported in many postoperative patients receiving topical thrombin intraoperatively causing prolongation of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time up to 12-fold, as reported by Flaherty, M.J. and ener, M.H. Antibodies to thrombin in postsurgical patients. Blood 73(5): 1386 (1989); Strieker, R.B., et al., Development of antithrombin antibodies following surgery in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves. Blood 72(4): 1375 (1988); Flaherty, M.J. , et al. Iatrogenic immunization with bovine thrombin: A mechanism for prolonged thrombin times after surgery. Ann . Int . Med . Ill: 631 (1989) .It is not possible to administer thrombin systemically since this could clearly result in massive systemic clotting.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an alternative therapy for microvascular bleeding. 

 It is a further object of the present invention to provide a therapy which can be administered syste ically or topically.Summary of the InventionIt has been discovered that by temporarily blocking one or more natural anticoagulants, such as the activation of intrinsic protein C, subsequent surgical or traumatic blood loss from a microvascular surgical or traumatic wound can be substantially reduced. Other natural anticoagulants include thrombomodulin, heparin cofactor II, antithrombin III, and tissue factor inhibitor pathway. The formation of activated protein C can be blocked systemically by intravenous administration of a monoclonal antibody (HPC4) which binds irreversibly to circulating protein C, effectively covering its activation site and therefore blocking any subsequent activation of the affected protein C molecule. The antibody is specific for the
