<ABSTRACT>
To achieve high bandwidth NSOM reflection-mode detection, we have 
developed a system in which the tip and aperture region of an
 NSOM probe 
serves as one end reflector of an optical cavity that includes an 

optically emissive medium. (For example, the emissive medium may be a 

Nd
³⁺ doped fiber laser continuous with the probe.) The 
field changes within the tip are then evidenced as small variations in 

the complex reflectivity at one end of the cavity. It is well known that 
these variations can result in substantial changes in the optical output 

characteristics of the emissive medium. For example, they may result in 
large changes in the output power from the opposite end of a fiber 

laser, particularly when the laser is operated near threshold. 
This hybrid, near field, fiber laser probe (105) can also be used for 
optical data recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
Recent advances have brought near-field scanning optical microscopy
(NSOM) to the point where it can be applied routinely to a variety of samples. For
example, the design and applications of a probe based on a metal-coated, tapered
optical fiber are described in E. Betzig, J. K. Trautman, T. D. Harris, J.S. Weiner,
and R. L. Kostelak, Science251, 1468 (1991); E. Betzig, P. L. Finn, and J. S.
Weiner, Appl.Phys.Lett.60, 2484 (1992); and E. Betzig and J. K. Trautman,
Science257, 189 (1992). Nevertheless, further refinement of near-field probes
remains an area of active interest. For example, the quantity and diversity of
applications would be enhanced through the development of probes having increased
photon flux. In the above-mentioned tapered fiber probe, the flux is limited, in large
part, because the transmitted energy is exponentially attenuated in evanescent modes
within the probe as the probe diameter tapers to dimensions substantially smaller
than the wavelength. However, rather than imaging the sample directly via this
comparatively weak emitted light, it is possible, in principle, to measure local
properties of the sample by their influence on the boundary conditions at the
emissive aperture of the probe and their consequent effect on the electromagnetic
field within the probe itself. The problem then becomes one of measuring these field
changes with sufficient speed and sensitivity to permit high bandwidth NSOM
reflection-mode detection.Reflective feedback probes have, in fact, been demonstrated for
operation at heights greater than one wavelength above the sample surface. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,860,276, issued to H. Ukita, et al. on Aug. 22, 1989,
describes an optical head which can be used for reading or writing digital data. This
head, which is carried on a flying slider, includes a self-coupled semiconductor laser
situated within several micrometers of the recording surface. The resulting spot size
is about 1 µm in diameter, which, however,is not substantially smaller than spot
sizes attainable using conventional focusing optics. Thus, the Ukita probe fails to
combine the high resolution of near-field detection with the relatively high signal-to-noise
ratios achievable by reflective feedback. To achieve this, and in that way to achieve high bandwidth NSOM
reflection-mode detection, we have developed a system in which the tip and aperture
region of an NSOM probe serves as one end reflector of an optical cavity that
includes an optically emissive medium. (For example, the emissive
