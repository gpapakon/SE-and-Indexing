<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a series of new 
modified oligodeoxyribonucleotides which have excellent 
anti-viral activity. The invention also provides 
methods and compositions using these oligodeoxyribonucleotides 
for the therapy and prophylaxis of viral 
infections and for inhibiting the proliferation of 
neoplastic cells. The invention also provides processes 
for the preparation of these compounds. The compounds 
of the present invention are particularly effective 
against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), now 
generally accepted to be the cause of AIDS. It is known that oligodeoxyribonucleotides 
(anti-sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides) having a sequence 
complementary to a gene inhibit the functional 
expression of that gene. Also it has been reported that 
anti-sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to a 
virus gene or oncogene can inhibit the replication of 
the virus or the multiplication of the cell by 
inhibiting the function of the respective genes [P. C. 
Zamecnik, M. L. Stephenson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
75, (1) 280 (1978) and P. C. Zamecnik, J. Goodchild, Y. 
Taguchi, Sarin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83, (6) 4143 
(1986)]. It has previously been thought that, in order that 
an anti-sense oligodeoxyribonucleotide should exhibit 
the desired activity, the oligodeoxyribonucleotide  
 
should be capable of forming a stable hybrid with the 
target RNA or DNA invivo and that, accordingly, it 
should have a chain length of 15 or more nucleotides. 
In general, however, it has not previously been possible 
to synthesize such oligodeoxy- ribonucleotides in yields 
and purities which enable them to be put to practical 
use. Moreover the anti-sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides 
do not have sufficient activity to inhibit the 
replication of the virus or to inhibit the 
multiplication of the cells to enable them to be used 
for treatment; moreover, the toxicity of these compounds 
towards the normal cells of a host is relatively high. Although oligodeoxynucleotides having a short chain 
length are known, it has previously been considered that 
they would have poor inhibitory activity. As a result, 
most researchers have concentrated on the investigation 
of oligodeoxyribonucleotides having longer chains than 
those of the present invention. Thus, for example, 
although PCT Application No. WO 88/07544 (which is 
thought to represent the closest prior art to the 
present invention) includes within its scope 
oligonucleotides having as few as 4 base units, in 
practice, it is clear
