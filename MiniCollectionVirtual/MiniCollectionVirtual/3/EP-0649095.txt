<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile storage 
which is accessed in data blocks by a host by using a flash 
memory composed of a plurality of flash memory chips capable 
of erasing data in blocks. In recent years, the technology innovation of secondary 
storage in computer systems has been remarkable, increasing 
data access speed and data capacity. In particular, compact 
nonvolatile storage are now in wide use because of their 
ability of holding data even while the power is off. For example, the nonvolatile storage disclosed in Japanese 
Laid-open Patent Application No. 3-259498 is provided with an 
EEPROM as a nonvolatile memory, and a temporary storage unit 
having a normal FIFO memory in the previous stage. The EEPROM 
includes a flash memory whose data can be erased in chips or 
blocks. When data are written from CPU to the nonvolatile 
memory, they are at first written in the temporary storage unit 
and then forwarded to the EEPROM by another circuit, for the 
purpose of reducing the time period during which CPU is 
occupied with writing data to the nonvolatile memory. In this 
case, it is necessary that data in the flash memory be erased 
before rewriting.  Thus, the conventional nonvolatile storage has to wait 
for the completion of a data erasing operation to start a data 
rewriting operation. It is possible to have cache memory instead of the FIFO 
memory in order to improve the data access speed. However, 
when there is a cache miss, data erasing and rewriting 
procedures are still necessary, which leads to slow data 
rewriting operations. The first object of the present invention is to provide 
a nonvolatile storage which has realized high speed data access 
by reducing the wait time to be spent to start a data rewriting 
operation after the completion of data erasing operation. The 
second object of the present invention is to provide a 
nonvolatile storage with improved efficiency of data erasing 
operations that are not concentrated at one time. These objects can be achieved by a nonvolatile storage 
which is accessed in data blocks by a host by using a flash 
memory composed of a plurality of flash memory chips capable 
of erasing data in blocks. The nonvolatile storage comprises the following units:
 
   a cache memory having a plurality of cache entries, each 
of the cache entries including data corresponding to data block 
in the flash memory and a write bit indicating a presence of 
a write to a data block in the cache entries;
 
 
   an erase bit holding unit for holding
