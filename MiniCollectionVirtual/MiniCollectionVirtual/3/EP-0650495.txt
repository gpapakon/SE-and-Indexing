<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel inhibitors of sex steroid activity such as
antiandrogen compounds having effective antagonistic activity while
substantially lacking agonistic effects. More particularly, certain preferred
embodiments of the invention relate to certain testosterone analogs which
have high affinity for androgen receptors but do not activate such receptors.
Some antiandrogens may additionally inhibit the production of sex steroids or
their precursors.During the treatment of certain androgen dependent diseases, it is
important to greatly reduce or, if possible, to eliminate androgen-induced
effects. For this purpose, it is desirable to both block access to the androgen
receptors with "antiandrogens", thus preventing androgens from binding and
activating those receptors, and also to reduce the concentration of androgens
available to activate the receptors. It is possible that, even in the absence of
androgens, unoccupied androgen receptors may be biologically active. Hence,
antiandrogens which bind and block the receptors may produce better
therapeutic results than therapy which only inhibits androgen production.Antiandrogens may have a significant therapeutic effect in slowing or
stopping the progress of androgen-dependent diseases, e.g. diseases whose
onset or progress is aided by androgen receptor activation. It is desired that an antiandrogen used in therapy to reduce androgen
receptor activation have both good affinity for the androgen receptor and a
substantial lack of inherent androgenic activity. The former refers to the
ability of an antiandrogen to bind to the androgen receptor, and thus to block
access to the receptor by androgens. The latter refers to the effect the
antiandrogen has on the receptor once it binds thereto. Some antiandrogens
may possess inherent androgenic activity ("agonistic activity") which
undesirably activates the very androgen receptors whose activation they are
intended to prevent. In other words, an antiandrogen with intrensic
androgenic activity may successfully bind to androgen receptors, desirably
blocking access to those receptors by natural androgens, yet may undesirably
itself activate the receptor.Known non-steroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide and anandron
lack undesirable androgenic activity, but may not have receptor affinity as good
as steroidal antiandrogens (i.e. androgen derivatives having a steroidal
nucleus that is modified to provide antiandrogenic activity). Steroidal
antiandrogens, however, are believed more likely to possess
