<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for reducing a voltage received at an input (3) of the circuit to provide a lower output voltage at an output (5) of the circuit comprises a voltage stabilizer (Zener diode ZD1 and the base-emitter junction of a transistor T2) connected between a point at a reference potential (ground or earth point) and the output (5) for stabilizing the output voltage at a predetermined level VZD1+VbeTR2, resistors (R1, R2) between the input and the output, and switch means (T1, T3, R3 to R6) responsive to the output voltage and arranged to coact with the resistors to provide a reduced resistance R1 between the input and output when the output voltage falls below the predetermined level, e.g. as a result of the input voltage falling or the output current rising. When the output voltage is above the predetermined level, T2 is turned on, and T3 and T1 are turned off; if the output voltage falls below the predetermined level, T2 turns off and T3 and T1 turn on, thereby effectively shorting out the resistor R2. As shown, the circuit forms part of an a.c. energised power supply suitable for use with a circuit which needs to remain operational even when the principal supply voltage varies between wide limits, for example a residual current device operable even when the mains voltage is as low as 50 volts a.c.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VOLTAGE REDUCTION CIRCUITThe present invention relates to a voltage reduction circuit capable of receiving an input voltage and providing in response thereto a relatively low output voltage. While such a circuit is of particular usefulness in a power supply circuit, other uses may be possible.A typical a.c. mains driven low voltage d.c. power supply using a very small number of components is shown in Fig. 1. This is relatively cheap and requires little room, and so fulfils two constraints commonly encountered when the manufacture of electrical/electronic goods is contemplated. This kind of power supply is designed to work from the a.c. mains supply at (say) a nominal 240V, but does not provide adequate regulation down to a supply voltage of 50 volts, due to constraints imposed by the power dissipation in resistor Rl and the zener diode ZDl and the consequential temperature rise. If the value of Rl were low enough to provide adequate current to the load at the regulated voltage with supply voltage down to 50V, excess dissipation would result when the mains supply went up to the 240V level.There is an increasing requirement in safety products, such as residual current devices, commonly known as earth leakage circuit breakers, which use electronic circuits requiring auxiliary low voltage power supplies, that they work down to S.E.L.V. (Safety extra low voltage) levels, defined in the 16th edition of the I.E.E. Wiring Regulations. This covers a very wide range of dangerous situations, when the supply voltage is between 50V to 264V, 50Hz, a.c. , r. .s. 

One way to overcome this situation is by the use of switched mode power supply techniques, using an inductor and an integrated circuit along with other components. This normally tends to be expensive, and requires more room in the assembly, in addition to E.M.I, shielding for the high frequency switching radiation.The present invention provides a voltage reduction circuit for reducing an input voltage at an input of the circuit to a lower output voltage at an output of the circuit, the circuit comprising: a voltage stabilizer connected between a point at a reference potential (ground or earth point) and the output for stabilizing the output voltage; resistive means for providing a resistance between the input and the output; and switch means responsive to the output voltage and arranged to coact with the resistance means to provide a reduced resistance between the input and output when the output voltage falls below a predetermined level.Embodiments of the
