<ABSTRACT>
A closure device, particularly for containers with a seal of 
guarantee which are formed by a lid (1) and a tray (2) made 

of plastic materials that can be coupled hermetically 
together along respective complementarily shaped peripheral 

edges (3, 4); comprises at least one engagement member (8) 
that protrudes from one of the edges of the tray (4) or of 

the lid (3) and can be inserted only in one direction in a 
corresponding opening (14) formed on the other one of the 

edges of the lid or of the tray. An engagement member (8) 
formed on the edge (3) of the lid (1) at a corner or at a 

protrusion thereof is joined to the edge (3) of the lid with 
tabs (12) that have a minimum resisting cross-section. The 

engagement member (8) includes a central pin (9) with an 
expanded end (10) that is shaped like a bulb or an arrow and 

from which a series of longitudinal stiffening ribs (11) 
extends radially; the opening (14) has a flared side wall 

(15) which is shaped substantially complementarily to the 
expanded end (10) of the opposite engagement member (8). The 

closure device has the advantage of high functionality and 
economy in manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a closure device 
particularly for containers with a seal of guarantee formed 
by a lid and by a tray made of plastic materials, obtained 
by injection-molding or with other forming processes, that 
can be mutually hermetically coupled along their peripheral 
edges. Closure devices of the above described type are commonly 
used for widely-used food product containers, described and 
claimed for example in the Italian patent application no. 
VI92A000079 filed on May 13, 1992 in the name of the same 
Applicant, the contents of which are included in the present 
application as reference. However, it is briefly noted that 
this prior application provides for a removable seal that 
normally prevents the lid from being raised in order to 
clearly indicate the integrity of the package. The seal 
consists of a portion of the edge of the tray, which is 
joined to the rest of the tray by means of thin tabs or 
stress raisers. When closed, the edge of the tray adheres 
perfectly to, and is uniformly blended with, the edge of the 
lid so that it has no protrusions or gaps with respect to 
the lid. A particular embodiment of this container provides 
for a means for the automatic mutual coupling of the 
detachable portion of the tray and the facing region ofg the lid 
which can be engaged when the lid is closed onto the tray 
and cannot be disengaged even after breaking the seal and 
opening the container. However, in this case, too, the edge 
of the lid and the edge of the tray have such a shape that 
they are blended perfectly when closed, so as to make it  
 
more difficult to separate them except by breaking the seal 
of guarantee. This configuration offers the maximum 
assurances of hygiene and tamper protection, but it can 
entail some difficulties in opening it, especially for 
individuals that have limited dexterity or for older people, 
and is furthermore rather complicated from the point of view 
of execution. The aim of the present invention is to provide a closure 
device, particularly suitable for containers with a seal of 
guarantee, which is highly functional but at the same time 
simple and cheap. A particular object of the present invention is to provide a 
closure device that shows clear evidence that it has been 
opened after its first use so as to be itself, in practice, 
a seal of guarantee. According to the invention, a closure device as defined in 
the introduction is characterized in that it includes at 
least one engagement member that protrudes from one of

Closure device particularly for containers with a seal of 
guarantee, formed by a lid (1; 1'; 1'') and by a tray (2; 2'; 

2'') made of plastic materials which can be mutually 
hermetically coupled along respective complementarily shaped 

peripheral edges (3; 3'; 3''; 4; 4'; 4''), characterized in 
that it comprises at least one engagement member (8; 8'; 8'') 

that protrudes from one of the edges of the tray (4; 4'; 
4'')or of the lid (3; 3'; 3'') and can be inserted, in only 

one direction and without the possibility of disengagement, 
in a corresponding opening (14; 14'; 14'') formed on the 

other edge of the lid or of the tray. 
Closure device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that each engagement member (8; 8'; 8'') is formed on the 

edge of the lid (3; 3'; 3'') at a corner or lateral 
protrusion thereof. 
Closure device according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said engagement member (8; 8'; 8'') is joined to the 

edge of the lid by tabs (12; 12'; 12'') that have a minimal 
resisting cross-section so that it can be easily separated 

from said lid by forces or rotations in an upward direction, 
in a downward direction and/or transversely in other 

directions. 
Closure device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said engagement member (8; 8'; 8'') comprises a central 

pin (9; 9'; 9'') with an expanded free end (10; 10'; 10''). 
Closure device according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said expanded free end (10; 10'; 10'') is substantially 

 
bulb-shaped. 
Closure device according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said expanded free end (10; 10'; 10'') is substantially 

arrow-shaped and is connected to the median portion of said 
pin (9; 9'; 9'') by means of a series of longitudinal radial 

stiffening ribs (11; 11'; 11''). 
Closure device according to claim 6, characterized in 
that said expanded end (10; 10'; 10'') has a maximum 

transverse dimension that is less than the outer diameter of
