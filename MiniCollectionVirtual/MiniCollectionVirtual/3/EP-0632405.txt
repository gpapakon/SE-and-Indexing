<ABSTRACT>
Random masks each having a given size and defining a random 
array of non-record pixel locations and record pixel locations 

are placed in association with record areas in mask registers. 
Using the placed masks, record data is thinned-out and supplied 

to a recording head. An image is then recorded. Thus, since 
thinning-out masks do not have periodicity, any inherent density 

nonuniformity loses periodicity. Consequently, high-definition 
images can be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording apparatus and 
method, or more particularly, to an ink-jet recording apparatus 
and method for recording by discharging ink from a recording 
head. Recording apparatuses such as printers, copying machines, 
and facsimile machines are designed to record images formed with 
dot patterns on recording materials such as paper or plastic film 
according to image information. When the recording apparatuses are classified in terms of 
recording modes, they are of an ink-jet type, a wire-dot type, a 
thermal type, and a laser beam type. The ink-jet type (ink-jet 
recording apparatus) is designed to effect recording by 
discharging ink (recording agent) droplets through ink-jet 
outlets in a recording head and fusing the ink droplets onto a 
recording member. In recent years, numerous recording apparatuses have been 
put to use. These recording apparatuses are being demanded to  
 
offer high recording speeds, high resolution, high image quality, 
and low noise. The ink-jet recording apparatus is a recording 
apparatus capable of meeting these demands. The ink-jet 
recording apparatus effects recording by discharging ink from a 
recording head. Stabilization of ink discharging and quantity 
(volume) of discharged ink is therefore essential to satisfy the 
above demands. The ink-jet recording apparatus has a facility for 
stabilizing ink discharging. Nevertheless, definition in 
recorded images depends largely on the performance of an 
individual recording head. A very small difference of a recording 
head from others occurring in the process of manufacturing 
recording heads; such as, a difference in the shape of each 
ink-discharging outlet (port, orifice) of a recording head or a 
difference in performance of an electro-thermal converter 
(discharge heater) affects a quantity of discharged ink or a 
discharge direction. Consequently, nonuniformity of density 
occurs in a finalized image, thus deteriorating image definition. An example of the foregoing problem will be described in 
conjunction with Figs. a-11-c and a-12-c. In Fig. 11-a, 1101 
denotes a multiple-nozzle recording head or multi-head. For 
simple illustration, the multi-head shall include eight nozzles 
1102. Reference numeral 1103 denotes ink droplets discharged by 
the multiple nozzles 1102. Normally, it is ideal that ink is 
discharged with equal quantities of discharged ink in the same  
 
direction. If this ink discharging is carried out, as shown in 
Fig. 11-b, dots of the same size are printed on
