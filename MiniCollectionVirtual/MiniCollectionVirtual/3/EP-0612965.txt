<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator with heat exchanger optimally 
configured to conserve electricity and improve a food 

storing capability at its best state. The refrigerator 
includes: a freezing room (21) connected from an evaporator (29) 

through a circulating passage, the freezing room having the 
circulating passage which circulates an air cooled by the 

evaporator; a storage room (23) connected to the freezing room, 
in which a temperature of the storage room is set higher 

than that of the freezing room; a flow-in passage (27a) connected 
to the storage room where the air cooled by the evaporator 

flows into the storage room; a flow-out passage (27b) connected 
from the storage room where a chilled air flows out of the 

storage room; and a heat exchanger (31) for exchanging heat 
between the cooled air flowing through the circulating 

passage and the chilled air flowing through the flow-out 
passage, so that the temperature inside the storage room is 

evenly and smoothly stable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator 
comprising: an evaporator, a freezing room, a circulating 
passage connecting the evaporator to the freezing room for 
circulating air cooled by the evaporator to the freezing 
room, a storage room in which a temperature is to be set 
higher than that of the freezing room, a flow-in passage 
connected to the storage room for circulating air cooled by 
the evaporator to the storage room, and a flow-out passage, 
connected to the storage room, for chilled air flowing out of 
the storage room. Such a refrigerator is disclosed in EP-A-O 
478 122. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the construction 
of the conventional refrigerator. Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional refrigerator 
consists of an evaporator 1, a duct 3, a freezing room 5, a 
fresh room 7, a vegetable room 9 and a damper 11. The 
temperature of the evaporator 1 is set below the 
temperature of the freezing room 5. High-temperature air 
is cooled by a compressor and a fan (not shown), so that 
the cooled air is distributed to the freezing room 5 and 
the fresh room 7. The air output from each room is 
returned to the evaporator 1 through the duct 3 and is 
again cooled by the evaporator 1. The fresh room 7 and the vegetable room 9 are cooled 
in a manner that the cooling degree therefor is controlled 
by an open-close of damper 11. The cooled air flows 
through the fresh room 7 and the vegetable room in this 
order. The flow directions of the air are shown by arrow 
marks in FIG. 1. Note that the freezing room 5 has the lowest temperature, 
the fresh room 7 has the temperature that is slightly  
 
higher than the freezing room 5, and the vegetable room 9 
has the temperature that is slightly higher than the fresh 
room 7. FIG. 2 is a timing chart showing the timing and 
duration of operating elements according to the 
refrigerator shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2, there are shown the temperature of the 
evaporator 1 with the compressor and fan being activated 
and not activated, state (open or close) of damper 11 of 
fresh room 7, the temperature in the fresh room 7 and the 
temperature of the cooled air blowing into the fresh room 
7. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, when the compressor and 
the fan are switched ON, the temperature of the evaporator 
1 is decreased. Then, the damper 11 is opened before the 
compressor and the fan are operated ON. Thus, the cooled 
air enters into the fresh room 7. Thereafter, when the 
fresh room 7 is sufficiently cooled, the damper 11 is 
closed so that the cooled
