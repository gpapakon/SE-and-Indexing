<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for automatically compensating 
for spring fatigue and aging, mechanical wear, and the like 

in a stud welding machine. In order to hold plunge time at 
an ideal constant value, the plunge times of each weld are 

measured and a running average is generated to adjust the 
command to drop the stud onto the workpiece as necessary to 

hold plunge time substantially at the ideal constant value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stud welding, 
especially as it is used in the manufacture of automotive 
vehicles. More in particular, the invention pertains to 
improvements in the method and apparatus used for such stud 
welding wherein the wearing, aging and the like of parts of 
the welding machine is automatically accommodated to 
maintain high quality welds over a long period of usage.  A stud welder comprises a power source and a gun or 
head which includes a collet to carry a stud to be welded 
to a workpiece. Welding is performed by first contacting 
the stud and the workpiece, and passing a relatively low 
current, called a pilot current, through the stud and 
workpiece. While this pilot current is flowing, the stud 
is lifted or moved away from the workpiece by a relatively 
short predetermined distance by means of a lift solenoid. 
This creates a pilot arc. Then, a much larger current, 
called the main arc current, is sent through the arc which 
was drawn when the stud was raised with respect to the 
workpiece. The main current is applied for a predetermined 
time sufficient to cause the stud and the workpiece to 
melt. Then, after a predetermined time after the main arc 
is stopped, the stud is urged into the workpiece to thereby 
weld the stud to the workpiece. The time between the cessation of the main arc until 
actual contact of the stud on the workpiece is critical. 
This time is called "plunge time". If the plunge time is 
too long, the stud and/or the workpiece will have cooled to 
the point where no weld will occur. If the plunge time is 
too short, then the molten metal will splash, and a poor 
weld or no weld will result. The problem to which the present invention is 
addressed, is that, with the passage of time and the making 
of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of welds, 
springs and the like in and associated with the lift 
solenoid wear and age. Other associated parts also wear 
and deteriorate. This causes the so called "drop time" to 
lengthen. Drop time is the elapsed time between the moment  
 
the lift solenoid is commanded to drop or move the stud to 
the workpiece, and the time when actual contact occurs. The present invention provides method and apparatus to 
accommodate changes in drop time while holding the plunge 
time substantially at the ideal constant value. The present invention provides method and apparatus to 
maintain a running average of the actual plunge times of a 
predetermined number of welds prior to forming each 
subsequent stud weld. As the

<CLAIMS>
In a stud welding machine having lift means for 
moving a stud toward and away from a workpiece to which it 

is to be welded and means to create a main arc between said 
stud and said workpiece to melt the portions of said stud 

and said workpiece to be welded together, the improvement 
comprising a method of compensating for changes in drop 

time to hold plunge time substantially at an ideal constant 
value, comprising the steps of measuring the actual plunge 

time of each weld, continuously averaging a predetermined 
number of said actual plunge times on a rolling basis, and 

changing the time of the drop command to said lift means to 
the next cycle. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said predetermined 
number of actual plunge times which are averaged is between 

4 and 8.
