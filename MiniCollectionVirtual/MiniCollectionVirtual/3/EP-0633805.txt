Flocculants are provided for use in Bayer process liquors which are copolymers of acids of formula (I) with ethylenically unsaturated copolymerisable monomer and which have molecular weight above 300,000. Preferably the polymer is a terpolymer of dibasic acid, monobasic and polymerisable termonomer. A particularly preferred flocculant is formed from at least 10 mol% maleic acid with acrylic acid and acrylamide as comonomers and is used preferably for flocculation of red mud in the primary settler and/or the various red mud washing stages.

<DESCRIPTION>
 WATER SOLUBLE POLYMERSThe present invention relates to water solubl copolymers formed from ethylenically unsaturated dibasi carboxylic acids of formula (I) :
 where R1 = H and R2 = COOH or R = COOH and R = H and the use of the copolymers a flocculating agents, especially in Bayer process liquors. Water soluble anionic polymers formed fro ethylenically unsaturated dibasic acids and ethylenicall unsaturated monobasic acids are known to be useful as meta sequestrants , as builders for detergents, and as scal inhibitors. For instance US-A-4,519,920 describe copolymers of maleic acid and (meth)acrylic acid havin molecular weight up to 8,000, useful as scale inhibitors. The polymers are made by continuously feeding th (meth)acrylic acid during polymerisation to a solution o half-neutralised maleic acid. The aqueous solution of th polymeric product is subsequently neutralised by the use o alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates. EP-A-0106111, EP-A-O106110, EP-A-076992 andEP-A-075820 all disclose copolymers of a monoethylenicall unsaturated dicarboxylic acid derived compound with monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid derive compound. These copolymers are of low molecular weight an are useful as scale inhibitors in detergent compositions.Higher molecular weight copolymers of ethylenicall unsaturated dibasic carboxylic acids are known for use a coagulants or flocculants. For instance CN-A-103292 describes the use of an acrylamide/maleic anhydrid copolymer as a coagulant to assist the multi-stag flocculation process for washing hydrated titanium dioxide. SU-A-1,411,297 describes the use of a neutralised copolyme 

of acrylic acid and maleic anhydride having molecular weight about 1 x 10 as a flocculant for the treatment of aqueous effluent, especially sewage effluent, flocculation. In SU-A-1,028,683 a terpolymer of ammonium aleate, (meth)acrylic acid and ammonium (meth)aerylate is used to flocculate suspended matter from aqueous wastes from galvanic processes. In SU-B-842,041 a copolymer of maleic acid and acrylamide is used to remove suspended matter from impure water. In JP-A-52085287 (1977) a copolymer of acrylamide and up to 5 wt.% ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid is used as a sedimentation aid and a flocculant. In SU-A-402,530 copolymers of acrylamide with either maleic acid or fumaric acid are used as flocculants. In JP-A-47020078 (1972) acrylic and maleic acid are copolymerised in aqueous solution to form flocculant polymer. There are also several disclosures by Asanov et al and from
