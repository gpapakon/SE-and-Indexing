<ABSTRACT>
The surface zones of workpieces of differing geometry and shape are to be modified in their properties such as, for example, wear resistance, by remelting of means of an energy beam, preferably an electron beam. By the introduction of melting tracks, workpieces of cast iron are treated in such a way that the surface zones are modified in a defined manner with slight surface deformation and freedom from pores is achieved. According to the invention, a wedge-shaped melting zone is produced by the deflectable energy beam, forming a vapour capillary. During this step, a critical value of the temperature in a defined edge region of the melting track, in particular of the surface temperature, is not exceeded. Certain parameters of the energy beam and the depth/width ratio of the melting track are preset. The process is preferably applied in the surface hardening of machine components, for example the running surfaces of camshafts.

Process for remelting surface regions of workpieces
made of ferrous materials, more particularly cast

iron, by generating zones of fusion having a defined
breadth b, preferably 2.5 mm, with a two-dimensionally

deflected energy beam, preferably a
beam of electrons, the beam diameter of which is

smaller than the breadth b of the zone of fusion,
generating a cuneiform zone of fusion which surrounds

a vapour capillary being formed by the action of the
electron beam, the parameters of the energy beam and

the rate of advance being chosen in a manner such
that a critical level of temperature in the narrow

heat-affected zone produced in the area surrounding
the generated zone of fusion, said level being

determined by the fusion temperature of the lowest
melting structural constituents, more particularly of

the surface temperature, is not exceeded at a
distance a from the edge of the generated fusion

track of 0 
<
 a ≤ b/2, and that the energy density
(ED) is chosen to be 35 to 200 Ws/mm
2
 of the energy
beam, the remelting rate of advance (V) to be 
>
 10
mm/s and the ratio of height to breadth (h:b) of the

fusion zone to be ≥ 1:1.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the fusion track is incorporated into the middle of

the workpiece surface in the region whose specific
properties are to be altered.
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the fusion track is incorporated above the

workpiece surface with its start and finish
overlapping. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the profile of the fusion track

on the surface of the workpiece is incorporated so as
to extend in a meandering or wave form.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the energy beam which generates

the fusion track is brought into action at an angle
α to 45° to the workpiece surface.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a plurality of fusion tracks

are incorporated alongside one another on the surface
of the workpiece.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that before the fusion track is

generated the workpiece is heated to a temperature of

>
 400°C.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that when melting grey cast

iron with lamellar graphite a material having a
maximum size of graphite precipitations of 100 µm is

used and when melting cast iron with spheroidal
graphite a material having a maximum spheroid

diameter of 40 µm is used.
