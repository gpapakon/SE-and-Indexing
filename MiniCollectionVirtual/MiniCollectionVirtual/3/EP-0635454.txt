<ABSTRACT>
An anti-(after)drip device at the outflow pipe of a dosing 
device, in particular a beverage machine, wherein, in a first 

outflow path (1) of the outflow pipe, a branch (3, 16) is 
provided for a second outflow path (13) having a direction 

which is different from that of the first outflow path and 
slants downwards, which branch can be bridged by the liquid at 

a relatively high flow velocity, whereas at decreasing flow 
velocity the residual liquid follows the second outflow path 

(13) through the branch (3, 16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an anti-(after)drip device at 
the outflow pipe of a dosing device, in particular a beverage 
machine. In such appliances and also in filling devices for bottles 
and the like, some form of prolonged after-drip arises at the 
end of each dosing operation, which entails a number of 
disadvantages. In a beverage machine with cups to be arranged 
under the outlet opening of the outflow pipe, a cup will 
oftentimes be removed before the dosing operation has been 
entirely completed. Dripping beverage may then fall onto the 
outside of the cup or onto the locating position or supporting 
surface for the cup. Both phenomena have an undesirably 
contaminatory effect. From laid-open Dutch patent application no. 8203763 it is 
known to avoid after-drip in a dosing device of the above-mentioned 
type by sucking out drops egressing through the 
outlet opening of the outflow pipe upon completion of the 
dosing operation. This requires the provision of a suction 
channel having its inlet by or near the outlet opening, as 
well as a vacuum pump. German 'Offenlegungsschrift' no. 2064456 discloses a 
dosing device where the outflow pipe can be closed by a valve 
which can be controlled by a outflow gutter tiltable about a 
horizontal axis and having a closed and an open outflow end. 
In one tilted end position of the outflow gutter, where the 
gutter slants downwards in the direction of the closed end, 
the valve is kept in closed position in the outflow pipe 
through spring bias. Dripping liquid, if any, of a previous 
dosing operation falls into the outflow gutter and is 
collected in the closed end thereof. By tilting the open 
outflow end of the gutter downwards, the valve is moved 
against the spring bias into the open position and a 
particular amount of liquid flows out through the outflow 
gutter into a cup or similar receptacle being held in 
readiness. Upon completion of the dosing operation, the valve  
 
is closed again and dripping residual liquid is collected in 
the closed end of the outflow gutter again. A swivelling outflow gutter with which drops can be 
diverted laterally of a cup supporting position is also 
described in German patent specification 3742930. In particular if the construction of beverage machines is 
compact, additional pumps, shut-off valves, swivelling gutters 
and the like constitute a problem. The object of the present invention is to provide a device 
for preventing after-drip at the outflow pipe of a dosing 
device, in particular after-drip onto the cup

<CLAIMS>
An anti-(after)drip device at the outflow pipe of a 
dosing device, in particular a beverage machine, characterized 

in that, in a first outflow path (1) of the outflow pipe, a 
branch (3, 16) is provided for a second outflow path (13) 

having a direction which is different from that of the first 
outflow path and slants downwards, which branch can be bridged 

by the liquid at a relatively high flow velocity, so that the 
liquid flow follows the first outflow path (1), whereas at 

decreasing flow velocity the residual liquid follows the 
second outflow path (13) through the branch (3, 16). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
outflow path (1) of the discharge pipe is interrupted in a 

first interruption (3), a supply part (2) of the first outflow 
path (1) being located upstream of the interruption (3) and an 

outflow part (4) of the first outflow path (1) being located 
downstream of the interruption (3). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
supply part (2) ends downstream in a spray nozzle (6) and the 

outflow part (4) begins upstream in an inlet end (10), which 
has a greater inner diameter than the spray nozzle (6). 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that 
a coupling sleeve (18) is arranged at the location of the 

interruption (3) in the first outflow path (1), said coupling 
sleeve (18) enclosing a collecting chamber (16) with a 

discharge channel (17) for the residual liquid. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
inlet end (10) of the outflow part (4) forms part of an inlet 

nozzle (11). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the device further comprises an aeration 

channel (19) originating in the interruption (3). 
A device according to claims 3 and 6, characterized in 
that the aeration channel (19) originates in a part of the 

interruption (3) located above the spray nozzle (6).  
 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 

spray nozzle (6) comprises a bevelled outlet end (9) slanting 
downwards in upstream direction. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that said 
inner diameter of the spray nozzle (6) is between 3.5 mm and 5 

mm and said inner diameter of the inlet end (10) is between 6 
mm and 15 mm. 
A device according to claim 9, characterized in that the 
distance between an upper side (7) of the spray nozzle (6) and 

the inlet end (9) of the outflow part (4) is between 0.5 mm 
and 2 mm. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
second outflow path originates in a part of the interruption 

(3) located below the spray nozzle (6).
