<ABSTRACT>
An outlet for a transport container having a substantially rigid container frame is secured to a flexible bag for the transport of a fluid. The contents of the bag are discharged through the outlet arranged in the bottom of the container. The outlet has a flange by means of which it is fixed to the transport bag, as well as a discharge opening. The outlet is in the form of a hollow housing with the discharge opening arranged at one side of the housing so that discharge takes place at a distance from the fixing flange.

<DESCRIPTION>
A discharge for a transport or liquid containerThe invention concerns an outlet for a transport or liquid container and of the type stated in the introductory por- tion of claim 1.Liquid containers are well-known and comprise a frame having walls to provide a closed container or box-shaped container. The container contains a bag with the fluid to be transported. An example is given in the Danish patent application 1787/86. The bag, which is frequently a dis¬ posable bag, is placed in the container, which is collaps¬ ible, and consequently reuseable, and then the bag is filled. The bag, which is preferably flexible and has a not insignificant tear strength, may be made of several layers of thin plastics, such as polyethylene. The bag im¬ parts the desired tightness to the container, while the actual container frame with walls provides the necessary mechanical stability. The containers can therefore be con- structed rather big, box-shaped and typically with a capa¬ city of more than 1 m3. Unloading and loading therefore take place using a fork truck. It is a very attractive way of handling fluids - not only liquids, but also granulates and other grain material being involved - since the trans- port volume has a very high degree of utilization in con¬ trast to barrels and other tanks, where the inexpedient geometric shape occupies a considerably waste volume. Since the container is collapsible, the space requirement is minimized considerably when the container is returned.However, a problem of the prior art is the discharge of the contents of the container, because this is done through an outlet provided on the bag to which a discharge tube is secured. Since the containers are adapted to be discharged from a position on the substrate, the dis- 

charge, which is merely a plastics outlet having a plane flange for welding to the bag and a discharge tube secur¬ ing sleeve protruding perpendicularly therefrom, is pro¬ vided somewhat upwardly on the side of the container, mak- ing it impossible to empty the container without manual or automatic tilting since, otherwise, part of the contents of the container will remain in the bag. *US patent specification 5 064 096 discloses a bag which serves as a protective liner for a tank having a bottom outlet. An outlet with a protruding tube fitting is at¬ tached to the bag through a welded flange. The tube fit¬ ting is adapted to be received in a sleeve on an outlet in the bottom of the tank. To prevent escape of liquid be- tween the tank and the liner, a press fit is

P a t e n t C l a i m s
1. An outlet (10) for a transport container of the type having a substantially rigid container frame in which a flexible bag (5) for the transport of a fluid is received, the contents of the bag (5) being discharged through the outlet (10) arranged in the bottom of the container, said outlet having a flange (13) by means of which it is fixed to the transport bag ( 5) as well as a discharge opening (21), c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the outlet (10) is in the form of a hollow housing having rigid walls (22) , said housing extending outside the surface of the bag (5) and being provided with the outlet opening (21) at one side of the housing such that discharge takes place at a distance from the fixing flange (13) .
2. An outlet according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the outlet forms a passage extending between the fixing flange (14) and the discharge opening (21), and that the channel is bent so that a plane defined by the fixing flange (14) is substantially perpendicular to a plane transversely to the discharge direction of the discharge opening (21).
3. An outlet according to claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the discharge opening (21) is blocked by a wall (24) which is removed prior to dis¬ charge.
4. An outlet according to claim 3, wherein the wall is substantially circular, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the wall (24) has a number of weakenings (26) in a radial direction. 


5. An outlet according to claims 1-4, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the passage defined with the housing has an inclined guide wall (22) in a side positioned opposite the discharge opening (21).
6. An outlet according to claims 1-5, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the passage in the form of a tube member with interior threads (25) extends past the discharge opening (21) blocked by the wall (24).
7. An outlet according to claim 6, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the internal threads (25) have a pitch of the same order as the thickness of the wall (24).
