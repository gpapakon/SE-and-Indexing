<ABSTRACT>
Prepn. of a SMC composition from reinforcing fibres, thickener and SMC.BMC recyclate is claimed. The recyclate is prepd. from the usual resins, fillers and additives. Before the mixing process the recyclate components were separately moistened with a monomeric and/or polymeric, resin-compatible, activating agent.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing a sheet moulding compound (SMC) which, for
further processing, is mixed with reinforcing fibres, such as glass fibres,

as well as thickeners, accompanied by the use of recyclate, the recyclate
being mixed into a resin filler mixture of conventional resins, fillers and

additives used in SMC/BMC production and prior to the blending of all the
components the recyclate is separately wetted by activating agents of resin-compatible

monomers and/or polymers, as well as additives, characterized
in that the recyclate is wetted until all microcracks of the recyclate

particles accessible from the outside are filled with activating agent and
only sufficient activating agent to maintain the free-flowability of the

wetted recyclate is added.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
for 100 parts by volume of recyclate 5 to 150 parts by volume of activating

agent are added.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
for 100 parts by volume of recyclate between 50 and 100 parts by volume of

activating agent are added.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
recyclates with particle sizes below 0.25 mm are used.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the recyclate proportion of the SMC is at least 5 wt.%.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the recyclate proportion of the SMC is at least 20 wt.%.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the recyclate proportion of the SMC is up to 60 wt.%.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
monomers, such as in particular styrene, are used as the main activating

component. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
for 100 parts by volume of recyclate no more than 75 parts by volume of

activating agent are added.
