<ABSTRACT>
A printing switching apparatus for a sheet-fed 
rotary press with a reversing mechanism includes a fixed 

gear (52), a rotary gear (54), a first inclined surface (54a), an 
engaging member (55), and an actuating unit (66). The fixed gear 

is fixed to a shaft (13a) of a cylinder. The rotary gear is 
coaxial with the fixed gear, coupled to be driven with a 

cylinder adjacent to the cylinder, and phase-adjustable 
with respect to the fixed gear in a circumferential 

direction. The first inclined surface is formed on the 
rotary gear. The engaging member is movable with 

respect to the fixed gear and has a second inclined 
surface (55a) pressed against the first inclined surface of 

the rotary gear. The actuating unit moves the engaging 
means in a direction to be separated from or come close 

to the fixed gear, presses or releases the first 
inclined surface of the rotary gear and the second 

inclined surface of the engaging member against or from 
each other, and connects or disconnects rotational 

transmission between the fixed gear and the rotary gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing 
switching apparatus, arranged in a sheet-fed rotary 
press with a reversing mechanism capable of performing 
both single-sided printing and perfecting printing, for 
adjusting circumferential phases of upstream and 
downstream cylinders with respect to a reversing 
cylinder in switching between single-sided printing and 
perfecting printing. Various sheet-fed rotary presses each capable 
of performing single-sided printing and perfecting 
printing have been proposed and put into practice along 
with a variety of printing techniques. An example of 
such a rotary press is disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 4-146149 in which a transfer cylinder, a 
cylinder having a diameter twice that of the transfer 
cylinder, and a reversing cylinder are arranged between 
an upstream cylinder and a downstream cylinder along a 
paper convey direction. This rotary press will be 
described below. Fig. 7 shows a cylinder arrangement in a 
single-sided printing state in the sheet-fed rotary  
 
press with a reversing mechanism, disclosed in this 
prior art. Fig. 8 shows a cylinder arrangement in a 
perfecting printing state in this press. Referring to 
Figs. 7 and 8, a first impression cylinder 5 having a 
gripper unit 4 having grippers 2 and gripper pads 3 
axially and parallelly arranged with the grippers 2 in a 
gap of the first impression cylinder 5 is pressed 
against a blanket cylinder 1 pressed against a plate 
cylinder (not shown) mounted with a plate. A second 
impression cylinder 10 having a gripper unit 9 having 
grippers 7 and gripper pads 8 axially and parallelly 
arranged with the grippers 7 in a gap of the second 
impression cylinder 10 is pressed against a blanket 
cylinder 6 pressed against a plate cylinder (not shown) 
mounted with a plate. A transfer cylinder 11, a cylinder 12 having a 
diameter twice that of the transfer cylinder 11, and a 
reversing cylinder 13 are arranged to be pressed against 
each other between the first and second impression 
cylinders 5 and 10. A gripper unit 16 having grippers 
14 and gripper pads 15 is axially arranged parallel to 
each other in a gap of the transfer cylinder 11. Gripper units 19 and 20 respectively having 
grippers 17 and gripper pads 18 are axially and 
parallelly arranged in the gaps at positions which 
divide the circumference of the cylinder 12 into halves. 
The gripper units 19 and 20 are circumferentially movable.  
 Suckers 21 and 22 are connected to a blower 
through rotary valves or the like at
