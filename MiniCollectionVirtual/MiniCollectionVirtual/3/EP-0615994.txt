<ABSTRACT>
An acid anhydride-containing one package epoxy resin 
composition consisting indispensably of (1) an epoxy resin 

having two or more epoxy groups in one molecule, (2) an acid 
anhydride, (3) at least one of (a) a liquid latent curing 

accelerator, (b) a latent curing accelerator soluble in an 
epoxy resin having two or more epoxy groups in one molecule and 

(c) a latent curing accelerator soluble in an acid anhydride 

and (4) a dispersible latent curing accelerator, in which the 
ratio of (1) to (2) is from 0.8 to 1.2 as (the number of acid 

anhydride equivalent)/(the number of epoxy equivalent) and the 
amounts of (3) and (4) each are from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight 

to 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin. 
The composition has excellent infiltrability, storage 
stability and reactivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a highly economic acid 
anhydride-containing one package epoxy resin composition 
having excellent processability and storage stability, which 
is suitable to impregnation and casting and which may rapidly 
be hardened under heat to give a cured product having excellent 
electric characteristics, thermal characteristics and chemical 
properties. An epoxy resin composition containing an acid anhydride as 
a curing agent may well be infiltrated into narrow slits, as it 
has a low viscosity. In addition, since the cured product from 
it has excellent electric characteristics, mechanical characteristics, 
thermal characteristics and chemical properties, 
the composition is used widely in various fields of sealants 
for condensers and impregnants for coils and sealants for 
transformers of large-size motors and generators and also of 
magnetic heads. However, an epoxy resin composition comprising an epoxy 
resin and an acid anhydride has a drawback that high temperature 
and long time are needed for curing it, though it has 
excellent storage stability and has a long pot life. In order  
 
to overcome the drawback, tertiary amines or their salts (JP-A 
64-60625, 59-140220 - the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"), imidazoles 
or their salts (JP-A 58-83024, 57-19001), organic 
phosphines (JP-A 63-304018, 57-40524), quaternary phosphonium 
salts (JP-A 1-25487, 61-151230) or the like are used as a curing 
accelerator. Incorporation of such a curing accelerator into 
the composition may much improve the hardenability of it but 
would involve another drawback of worsening the storage 
stability of it. Due to the poor storage stability of the 
composition containing such a curing accelerator, the operator 
must prepare the composition every time of using it. In 
preparing the composition, the operator must meter the amounts 
of all the epoxy resin, acid anhydride and curing accelerator 
separately. Such operation not only worsens the processability 
and workability of the composition but also causes metering 
errors. In addition, the excess stock of the composition 
cannot be stored but must be discarded, which, however, is 
unfavorable from the viewpoints of saving natural resources and 
of environmental problems.
 
The use of a salt of p-toluenesulfonic acid and a tertiary 
amine such as triethylamine as a curing accelerator for the 
composition has been investigated (JP-A 60-4520). However, the 
reactivity of the composition
