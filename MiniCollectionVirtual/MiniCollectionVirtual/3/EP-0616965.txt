<ABSTRACT>
A method of coreless rewinding of 
retail-sized logs wherein the logs are developed alternately 

side-by-side on small diameter elongated mandrels, 
comprising the steps of

 
   providing first and second elongated winding 

mandrels (15,15';115,115') and alternately winding a web directly on 
first mandrel to develop a predetermined diameter log (L) while 

stripping a previously wound log from said second mandrel,
 

said winding step including supporting each mandrel substantially 
along its length while rotating each mandrel by contacting the same with 

surface drive means (17,18,17',18';117,118,117',118'),
 

said stripping step including moving said first mandrel from a 
winding position to a stripping position and then back to said winding 

position while said web is being wound on said second mandrel and 
transversely severing said log into a plurality of retail-sized 

products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coreless winding method and 
apparatus and, more particularly, to one that produces products 
without cores using small diameter mandrels on a continuous 
basis to develop retail size logs from jumbo parent rolls. It is known that toilet tissue is being produced using 
cores with glue applied to the exterior. This is done with both 
center, and surface rewinders -- see, for example, co-owned 
US-E-28,353 and US-A-4,828,195, respectively. Going back a 
long time, tissue products were produced on stop-start rewinders 
using small mandrels which were surface driven. Still another 
process is center winding without cores by using a mandrel that 
collapses after the completion of the wind cycle as seen in 
GB-A-1,554,619 but which does not permit small diameter 
mandrels.  
 According to the invention, the winding is performed at 
alternating positions. This permits the use of small mandrels 
because each mandrel can be supported at multiple points along 
it length. Also, the finished wound roll can be decelerated 
and ejected from the machine while the opposing winding station is 
winding the next log. The concept of alternate winding is old perse but not 
for finished size logs. For example, US-A-1,894,253 winds the 
jumbo rolls alternately -- but with a web being delivered from 
the paper making machine. More particularly, the web being 
wound into alternate jumbo rolls comes continuously from the 
last pass of the calendar stack of the paper making machine. 
This jumbo size roll has not been cut into retail roll lengths, 
as in the invention -- but instead is taken to a converting area 
for rewinding into retail diameter logs which are then 
transversely severed by log saws. So there was no point in 
removing the winding reels from the jumbo log since these reels 
were needed to support the jumbo rolls in the rewinder. Other 
forms of surface winders can be seen in US-A-4,256,269 and 
US-A-4,588,138 but neither of these dispenses with a 
core, as in the instant invention. DE-A-3239661, that discloses a method according to the preamble 
of claim 1, teaches a mandrel driven at one end, ie., a center-type 
winder, in contrast to a surface winder employed in the present 
invention. The drawbacks to the prior art have been overcome by a 
method of coreless rewinding according to the characterising part 
of claim 1.  
 Other objects and advantages of the invention may be 
seen in the details of construction and operation set forth in 
the ensuing specification. The invention is

<CLAIMS>
A method of coreless rewinding, comprising the 
steps of providing first and second elongated winding 

mandrels (15, 15', 115, 115') and alternately winding a 
web (W) directly on the first mandrel (15, 115) to develop a 

predetermined diameter log (L) while stripping a 
previously wound log from said second mandrel (15', 115'), said 

stripping step including moving said first mandrel (15, 115) from a 
winding position to a stripping position and then back to 

said winding position while said web (W) is being wound on 
said second mandrel (15', 115'), characterized by: cradling each 

mandrel (15, 15'; 115, 115') 
carrying the log (L) to be wound between a pair of 

winding rolls (17, 18, 17', 18'; 117, 118, 117', 118') 
and a third roll (12; 132; 132') to support each mandrel 

(15, 15'; 115, 115') 
substantially along its length while rotating each 

mandrel by contacting each mandrel with said winding 
rolls, providing means (16, 16'; 19', 20'; 129, 129') for 

moving each roll pair away from its associated third roll 
(12; 132; 132') 

during winding to accommodate increases in diameter 
incident to reaching said predetermined diameter, and 

transversely severing said log (L) into a plurality of 
retail-sized products.

said steps include providing first and second pivotable 

arms (16, 16') each rotatably, pivotally supporting said 
pair of winding rolls (17, 18, 17', 18'; 117, 118, 117', 118') 

and rotatably supporting one of 
said mandrels (15, 15') and pivoting said winding rolls

said steps include providing first and second arms (116, 

116') each having a slot carrying an associated mandrel (115, 115')

its associated winding roll (117, 118, 117', 118') 
pair during winding.

said steps include providing interlaced rolls to 

constitute said winding rolls (117, 118, 117', 118').

said step of providing said mandrels (15, 15'; 115, 115') 

includes providing 
mandrels of the diameter of less than about 25 mm (one 

inch). 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
said step of alternately winding includes providing each 

mandrel (15, 15', 115, 115')

The method of claim 1, characterized in that 
said transversely severing step includes producing 

products having a generally cylindrical outer shape and a 
diameter of less than about 250 mm (ten inches).
