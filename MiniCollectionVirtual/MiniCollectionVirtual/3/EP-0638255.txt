<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a jewellery element (1) for strip-shaped bands (33), such as bracelets, necklaces, watch straps made of leather, artificial leather, precious or non-precious metals or the like, having a hollow profile which is essentially rectangular in cross-section, has two limbs (2, 3) and two webs (4, 5), preferably arranged at right angles to one another, and can be attached to the strip-shaped band (33). Such a jewellery element (1) can be produced in a simple and cost-effective manner, can be attached both to endless bands and to bands (33) which can be opened in at least one place, and provides a secure fit on a strip-shaped band (33) without slipping along the band (33) if one limb (3) is attached to the first web (4) so as to be pivotable about an axis of rotation (8), and the limb (3) rests in the closed state against the opposite first web (5).
