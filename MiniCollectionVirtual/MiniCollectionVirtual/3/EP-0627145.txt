<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and to a system for achieving communication between a customer (A) of a service which can be supplied over a telecommunication network and a supplier (16, 17) of the service. The invention finds its application in intelligent network services. A service order from the customer passes to a service order central (12) where it is parked and allotted an order identity (AAI), which is transferred through a signal connection (5) together with the order. The service supplier can, himself, configure the method in which the service shall be delivered and the service supplier himself takes the initiative of creating a communication connection with the service order central (12) and therewith refers to the order identity (AAI). When the communication connection has been established, the connection is coupled by the service order central (12) with the parked call from the customer (A) and delivery of the service can commence. A method which utilizes the services of subsidiary suppliers is also possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field
of communication services that are performed through
selected telecommunication networks. The invention
relates in particular to a service interaction method.
A service interaction method is a method of establishing
cooperation between two functionalities via a
telecommunication network.The present invention is related to the following five
patent applications, to which the following description
refers:
1) "A Method of Establishing a Connection", WO93/16544,2) "A Method of Establishing Cooperation with a
Functionality", WO93/16547,3) "A Method of Supporting Communication",
WO93/16546,4) "A Paging Method", WO93/16564;
and5) "A Method of Organizing Communication",
WO93/16545.These applications are enclosed as an annex to the
present description and describe mechanisms which can
be used in the method according to the present invention. By communication services is meant conventional telephony
services, telex services, datapack services,
datel services, telefax services, videotext services,
ISDN-services, mobile telephony services, personal
paging services, tele-point-services and general
communication between two or more parties. The services
recited above are only examples of the services
possible and are not intended to limit the scope of
the invention.By telecommunication network is normally meant the
telephone networks, telex networks, circuit connected
data networks, picture information transfer networks,
private telecommunication networks, radio networks,
satellite communication networks and general carriers
of the communication services, such as analog transmission,
digital transmission, synchronous, multiplex
or asynchronous multiplex transmission, ATM, etc., for
example. These networks are recited solely by way of
example and the invention is not restricted thereto.By functionality is meant the ability to perform an
operation in a telecommunication network. Examples of
functionality include activities and services that can
be performed in the telecommunication network. Examples
of functionalities include an enquiry to establish
a connection path or route between two parties,
digit analysis, billing or ticketing. Although not
necessary, the functionality may require the availability
of dedicated equipment for carrying out the
functionality. For instance, if the functionality is
to receive tones and to analyze tones, it is necessary
to make a tone receiver accessible. Other examples of
functionalities include voice-controlled speech information,
