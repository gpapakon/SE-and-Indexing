<ABSTRACT>
A corona discharge ionisation source, for use for example with an ion mobility spectrometer, comprises an adjustable corona point electrode (20) which is held transversely within a cylindrical target electrode (14). A corona discharge is produced by a constant or pulsed potential difference between the two electrodes. In alternative embodiments, there may be a further corona discharge electrode (58), providing additional control, and also an annular counterelectrode (60) surrounding the further point electrode (58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ionisation sources 
for analytical instruments, more particularly corona 
discharge ionisation sources, and to detectors and 
instruments employing such sources. The invention 
relates particularly but not exclusively to sources for 
ion mobility spectrometers. The operation of a number of analytical instruments 
is dependent upon the ionisation of either the separated 
or unseparated components of a material of interest, most 
usually a gas or vapour. In the case of already 
separated components this is followed by measurement of 
the respective resulting ionic current flows; or in the 
case of unseparated components, first by separation based 
upon the one or more characteristics of the resultant 
ions, followed by ionic current measurement of the 
respective separated ion groups. The magnitude of the ionic currents in either case 
is an indication of the quantity of the individual 
separated components of the original material of 
interest. An example of the first type of equipment is the gas 
chromatograph where time-separation of the components of 
a sample, by means of a separation column, precedes their 
introduction into a detector, for example an electron 
capture detector. An example of the second type of 
equipment is the ion mobility spectrometer where the 
ionised but unseparated components of a sample material 
are subsequently time-separated in a drift tube as a 
function of the respective ion mobilities. A further 
example of the second type is the mass spectrometer where 
the component ions are separated according to their ionic  
 
masses. Ionisation in such detectors or instruments is 
frequently achieved by means of the ionising radiation 
emanating from a radioactive source, for example Nickel-63, 
which is commonly used as the ionising material in 
both electron capture detectors and in ion mobility and 
mass spectrometers. The radioactive material is most 
usually deployed as a plating upon a metal foil, which 
may be formed into a cylindrical configuration through 
which the material to be ionised is passed. The employment of radioactive source materials 
requires special precautions, and in many territories is 
subject to exhaustive regulatory controls for reasons of 
health and safety. Extensive precautions, and 
considerable associated documentation, are therefore 
required in the manufacture, transport, storage, use and 
repair of detectors and instruments incorporating such 
radioactive ionising sources. It is thus one object of the present
