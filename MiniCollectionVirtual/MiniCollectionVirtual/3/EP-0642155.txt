<ABSTRACT>
In a method of manufacturing a semiconductor 
device having a capacitor constituted by a lower 

electrode, an upper electrode, and a dielectric film 
arranged between the lower and upper electrodes, a 

polysilicon film containing a Group V element as an 
impurity is formed. The first etching step of forming 

an uneven portion on a surface of the polysilicon film 
is performed, it preferably etching the more highly doped crystal grain 

borders. The second etching step of forming an 
uneven portion on the surface of the polysilicon film is 

performed. The second etching step has an etch rate 
whose impurity concentration dependency is different 

from an impurity concentration dependency of an etch 
rate of the first etching step, preferably lower, and increases the width 

of recessed portions produced by the first etching step. It also removes 
porous silicon left by the first etching step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a semiconductor device and, more
particularly, to a method of manufacturing a
semiconductor device having a capacitor.With an increase in integration density of a
DRAM in which one memory cell is constituted by one
transistor and one capacitor, in order to obtain a
required storage charge capacitance within a limited
occupied area, a method of making the surface of an
electrode uneven to increase the effective surface area
of the electrode is proposed. As a prior art for making
the electrode surface of a capacitor uneven, a method of
manufacturing a DRAM memory cell having a stacked
capacitor described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 3-139882 will be described below with reference to
Fig. 10. Note that Fig. 10 shows the memory cell.A field oxide film 2 for performing element
isolation by a LOCOS method is formed on a p-type
semiconductor substrate 1. Thereafter, the resultant
structure is dried or oxidized with steam to form a gate
oxide film 3 having a thickness of about 10 to 30 nm on
the active region of the substrate 1. The first 
polysilicon film 4 having a thickness of about 100 to
300 nm is deposited on a region in which a memory cell
is to be formed by an LPCVD method or the like, and
phosphorus (P) is doped in the first polysilicon film 4
at a concentration of about 1020 cm-3 by thermal diffusion
using POCl3 as a source. Thereafter, a resist is
patterned using a normal photolithographic technique,
and the polysilicon film 4 is etched using the patterned
resist as a mask to form word lines 4, including gate
electrodes on the gate oxide films 3, of memory cells
respectively located on the field oxide film 2 and the
gate oxide films 3.Arsenic (As) is ion-implanted in the resultant
structure using the word lines 4 and the field oxide
film 2 as masks, and the resultant structure is annealed
to form n+-type diffusion layers 5a and 5b each having an
arsenic concentration of about 1020 cm-3 in the surface
portion of the substrate 1. Thereafter, a silicon oxide
film 6 serving as a first insulating interlayer 6 having
a thickness of 100 to 300 nm is deposited on the entire
surface of the resultant structure by an
atmospheric-pressure CVD method or the like, and an
opening is formed in the silicon oxide film 6 on a
predetermined portion of the n+-type diffusion layer 5a
by a dry etching technique using, as a mask, a resist
patterned by a normal photolithographic technique,
thereby forming a contact hole 7. Subsequently, a refractory metal
