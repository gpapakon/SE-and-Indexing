<ABSTRACT>
A cable gland has a tubular body 1 provided with a counterbore 18 at 
one end providing an internal abutment shoulder for a tubular seal 2 

received in the counterbore 18. The seal 2 has an internal apertured 
diaphragm 21 for sealing around an electric cable extending through the 

gland body 1. The diaphragm 21 is inclined towards the exit end of the 
gland body 1 and is prevented from reversing under increased pressure on 

the exit side by a complementary support plate 3 positioned behind the 
diaphragm 21 on the entry side and retained by an insert 4 received in the 

counterbore 18. The insert 4 has an external taper surface 4

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cable glands for connecting electric cables to 
junction boxes or other electrical fittings or equipment. Cable glands are commonly employed to seal cable entries to junction 
boxes for increased safety, particularly in hazardous environments, and 
provide a flame-proof path to contain any explosion occurring within the 
junction box. The known seals are generally of the compression type in which the 
seal is compressed radially onto the cable by relative rotation of two 
threadably engaged parts of the gland. The efficiency of such seals can be 
adversely affected if the gland parts are not fully engaged and/or if the 
wrong size of seal is fitted. US-A-3663740 discloses a cable splice case with a seal assembly at 
each end. The seal assembly includes a resilient seal member having a 
cylindrical outer sealing portion located in an annular groove of the splice 
case and connected by an integral planar end portion to a coaxial cylindrical 
inner sealing portion for sealing contact with the cable. The outer sealing 
portion is internally supported by a rigid ring element and the end portion is 
externally supported by a rigid disc element. US-A-4756510 discloses a system for installing fibre optic cable in a 
pipeline with a cable seal at entry and exit ends of a pipeline. The cable 
seal has a flat outer flange portion for locating and securing the seal at the 
end of the pipeline, and an inner lip or hub portion for sealing contact with 
the cable. The inner lip or hub portion may have a cylindrical or frusto-conical 
shape. The frusto-conical shape provides a recess allowing axial 
stacking of seals for use when operating pressures exceed about 150 psig. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cable gland for 
electrical cables which does not rely on relative rotation of threadably 
engaged parts of the gland for sealing efficiency. It is a further object of the invention to provide a cable gland capable 
of maintaining sealing efficiency at high pressures, for example under 
explosive conditions in hazardous environments. According to the present invention there is provided a cable gland 
comprising a hollow gland body having a receiving end, a seal member 
having an outer sleeve portion for reception in the receiving end and an 
inwardly extending diaphragm portion for contacting a cable extending  
 
through the gland body, and a support member for supporting the diaphragm 
portion characterised in that the gland includes a hollow gland part having

<CLAIMS>
A cable gland comprising a hollow gland body (1) having a receiving 
end (1
a
), a seal member (2) having an outer sleeve portion (17) for 
reception in the receiving end (1
a
) and an inwardly extending 
diaphragm portion (21) for contacting a cable extending through the gland 

body (1), and a support member (3) for supporting the diaphragm 
portion (21) 
characterised in that
 the gland includes a hollow gland part (4) 
having an abutment end (4
a

the receiving end (1
a
) for locating the support member (3) in the assembled 
gland with the diaphragm portion (21) and support member (3) arranged to 

converge away from the abutment end (4
a

the diaphragm portion (21) with the cable when the diaphragm portion (21) is 

subjected to a higher pressure on that side remote from the abutment 
end (4
a

A cable gland according to Claim 1 characterised in that the 
diaphragm portion (21) defines an aperture (23) for the cable with an 

optional sealing lip (22) extending axially from the marginal edge of the 
aperture (23) for engagement with cable, and the support member (3) 

defines an aligned hole (25) for the cable. 
A cable gland according to Claim 2 characterised in that the support 
member (3) is adapted for conformation of the hole (25) to a range of cable 

sizes, for example by having radial slits (25
a
