<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a local drug delivery film, which is characterized by comprising, as release control component, polymer mixture consisting of polycaprolactone having molecular weight of 30,000 - 60,000 and polycaprolactone having molecular weight less than 1,000 in a ratio of 1:1 - 4:1, and as active component, periodontal therapeutic agent. The present local drug delivery film is prepared by admixing homogeneously active component with melted polymer mixture and pressing into film. And the present drug delivery film has excellent sustained release pattern and excellent treatment effect in oral disease with release amount 1.7 mg which is 0.12 % of prescription amount, 1400 mg, for adults during 7 days and provides the application stability into human body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a local drug delivery
for periodontal disease treatment and, in detail, it
relates to a local drug delivery film for periodontal
treatment containing a periodontal therapeutic agent for
as active component and a mixture of two kinds of polycaprolactone
having different molecular weight each other,
which has excellent sustained releasing property with
effective concentration for periodontal treatment, can be
prepared easily by melt casting and has a excellent
stability in a human gingival fibroblast.Recently, concerns about the development of new kinds
of drug have been emphasized but it cost too much.
Alternatively, many researches relating to the development
of various kinds of local drug delivery to increase
the effect of prescription of conventional active component
show a tendency to increase. Particularly, there
were many suggestions in the field of treatment for
diabets, hypertension, cancer and periodontal disease.Since tetracycline-filled cellulose acetate hollow
fiber was proposed at first by Goodson et al. ("Periodontal
therapy by local delivery of tetracycline" J.
Clin. Periodontal., 6 : 83, 1979), many kinds of release
control systems were studied using dialysis tube, polyethylene, 
polypropylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, polycaprolactone,
collagen, acrylic strip, etc. Particularly,
in case of the cellulose acetate as release control
material, release controlled drug delivery was studied in
the form of hollow fiber or film.But, concerning the results of these studies, in case
of tetracycline-filled hollow fiber prepared by Goodson
et al., 95 % of tetracycline was released within 2 hours,
the half life of release (t½rel ) was about 0.5 hour and
the concentration of tetracycline in gingival fibroblast
was 15 µg/ml after 24 hours.
This non-sustained release was also shown in conventional
local drug delivery using dialysis tube, polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyurethan, polycaprolactone and cellulose
acetate, and almost drug contained in such preparations
was released within 24 hours.In case of ethylene vinyl acetate fiber, sustained
release pattern was shown for 9 days, but initial release
concentration was 650 µg/ml and the half life of release
was 13 hours. That is, even if the effect of drug itself
came out, there was a tendency that durability of the
effect of drug was on the decrease.Also, jelly-type delivery system containing 2 % of
minocycline was studied in Japan, in which the concentration
of minocycline in gingival fluid decreased rapidly
till 7 hours
