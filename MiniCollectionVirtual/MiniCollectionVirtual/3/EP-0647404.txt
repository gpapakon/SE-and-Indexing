<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a croissant dough-piece 
bending apparatus having a conveyor (3) for 

conveying rolled-up croissant dough pieces (1), a dough-piece 
bending member (81) to push the central portion of 

the dough piece in a downstream direction, and a pair of 
swingable dough-piece bending belts (9). The dough-piece 

(1) is pushed by the dough-piece bending member (81) 
toward and between the dough-piece bending-belts (9). The 

dough piece is correctly bent at its center by the 
cooperation of the bending member (81) and the bending-belts 

(9). By this means dough pieces can be bent 
without getting wrinkles on their surfaces, and 

symmetrically bent products of a uniform shape can be 
obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of bending
a fusiform bread dough piece, for instance a rolled-up
croissant dough piece, at its center portion while it is
being conveyed, before conveying it to downstream
processing stations.Conventional croissants are generally curved or
bent, and to obtain products of such a shape, many
forming apparatuses have been developed. For instance,
Netherlands Patent Application No. 8800402 and European
Patent No. 329235 relate to the bending
of a rolled-up croissant dough piece from both its ends.According to the prior art, the structure of dough-piece
bending machines is complex, and it is not easy to
bend a croissant dough piece precisely at its center.
Thus the dough pieces bent in this manner took an
asymmetric form, so that they provided low-quality
products.It is an object of the present invention to enable
croissant dough pieces to be correctly bent at their
center while they are being conveyed.The present invention provides a croissant dough-piece
bending apparatus according to independent claim 1.In one embodiment of the invention the dough-piece 
bending-member includes a roller having flanges at its
sides to form grooves on the surface of the dough piece.One embodiment of the present invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
which:-
Fig. 1 is an overall plan view of a dough-piece
bending machine that includes the dough-piece bending
apparatus embodying the present invention;Fig. 2 is an overall side view of the machine shown
in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a front sectional view of the center-aligning
apparatus; andFig. 4 is a partial side view of the apparatus shown
in Fig. 3.The croissant dough-piece bending apparatus
embodying the invention comprises a conveyor 3 to convey
rolled-up croissant dough pieces 1. An additional
conveyor 2, namely a dough-piece supplying conveyor, is
located upstream of and above the conveyor 3. A center-aligning
apparatus for croissant dough pieces is located
adjacent the downstream end of the additional upstream
conveyor 2 and between the two conveyors 2, 3.The center-aligning apparatus has a pair of concave
rollers 4, 4' and a pair of shutters 5, 5'. The
apparatus serves to align the center of the croissant
dough piece supplied from the upstream conveyor 2 and
deposit it on the conveyor 3 to facilitate bending of the
dough-piece 1 at its center in the subsequent line as
explained below.To further align the center of the croissant dough
piece 1, a pair of freely-rotatable inclined rollers 6
may be

<CLAIMS>
A croissant dough-piece bending apparatus comprising:

a conveyor (3) for conveying rolled-up croissant dough pieces (1), and
a dough-piece bending means (8) to push the dough piece (1) in the direction

of its movement on the conveyor (3); and characterised by:
a pair of dough-piece bending belts (9) provided on the conveyor
downstream of the bending means;
the pair of dough-piece bending belts (9) being located symmetrically
relative to the conveyor (3), the opposite surfaces of the bending belts

converging toward each other in the downstream direction, the dough-piece
bending belts (9) being adapted to swing about their downstream ends toward

and away from each other so that the dough piece (1) is bent at its center in
cooperation with the movement of the dough-piece bending means (8), said

dough-piece bending means (8) being arranged such that it pushes the dough-piece

(1) between the dough-piece bending belts (9).
A dough-piece bending apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
dough-piece bending means includes a roller (81) having flanges (82) on both

sides to form bending grooves on or in the surface of the dough-piece (1).
