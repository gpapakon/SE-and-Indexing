<DESCRIPTION>
The Government of the United States of America has rights 
in this invention pursuant to Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC21-90MC2609 
awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. This invention relates to a method for the direct 
oxidation of light alkanes to form the corresponding alcohols; 
in particular, the direct catalytic oxidation of methane to 
methanol. The catalyst found to be useful in the method of 
this invention comprises a manganese-substituted 
aluminophosphate composition. The ability to directly convert methane to methanol in 
economically satisfactory yields is an important goal of the 
oil and gas industry. Methane is an abundant material found 
world-wide, particularly in the form of natural gas. As a 
gas, it is difficult and costly to transport. Conversion to 
the liquid methanol allows for safer, more efficient 
transportation. In addition, methanol is a valuable 
commercial feedstock, an important ingredient in the 
production of reformulated motor fuels, and an environmentally 
compatible fuel in itself.  
 The conventional method for the catalytic conversion of 
methane to methanol involves a first reaction with water 
(steam reforming) to produce synthesis gas, which is a mixture 
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, followed by catalytic 
conversion of the synthesis gas to methanol. A direct, one-step 
oxidation of methane to methanol would be simpler, and 
economically and environmentally preferable. Several catalytic and non-catalytic approaches to 
directly converting methane to methanol are known in the art. 
Among these are the following catalytic processes: United Kingdom Pat. No. 1,244,001 discloses the oxidation 
of methane to methanol over a catalyst consisting of 
(Mo2O3)·Fe2O3 on silica/alumina (25% Al2O3/75% SiO2), sintered to 
0.1 g/cm2 at 1000°C, with 65% selectivity (moles methanol/moles 
product X 100) at 2.1% conversion. The temperature 
disclosed is 439°C and the pressure 52 atmospheres. 
Temperatures, pressures and space rates in the process 
disclosed in this patent are 300°-550°C.; 5-150 atmospheres; 
and 20,000-50,000 hr-1, respectively.  
 Eusuf, Sci. Res., Dacca (1969) Vol VI, Nos. 1,2, p.16, 
discloses the oxidation of methane to methanol over 
CrO3/pumice. The reported results indicated 12% selectivity 
at 11% O2 conversion. The reported 8.9% methane conversion is 
noted to most likely be an error as indicated by the reported 
carbon/oxygen balance. The actual conversion rate may have 
been far lower. Further results on the chlorine-promoted oxidation of
