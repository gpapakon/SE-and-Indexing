<ABSTRACT>
A method of improving oxidation resistance of a platinum modified
aluminide diffusion coating on a substrate involves electroplating

the substrate with a platinum layer from an aqueous hydroxide based
electroplating solution and aluminizing the substrate to grow the

platinum modified aluminide diffusion coating on said layer. The
electroplating solution preferably includes an alkali element

and/or alkaline earth element that is incorporated in the platinum

layer and in the aluminide diffusion coating formed thereon to
significantly improve oxidation resistance of the coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to platinum modified aluminide
diffusion coatings and methods for making such coatings using a
platinum plating techniques that improve coating high temperature
oxidation resistance.In modern gas turbine engines, the high pressure turbine
section hardware, such as turbine blades and vanes, is exposed to
temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees C for extended periods of
time. At such temperatures, high temperature oxidation is the most
important form of environmental attack observed with aluminide
diffusion coatings. High temperature oxidation is a chemical
reaction whose rate controlling process for an aluminide coating is
diffusion through a product (oxide) layer. Diffusion is a thermally
activated process, and consequently, the diffusion coefficients are
exponential functions of temperature. Since the oxidation of
aluminide coatings is a diffusion controlled reaction and diffusion
coefficients are exponential functions of temperature, the
oxidation rate is also an exponential function of temperature. At
low temperatures where diffusion coefficients are relatively small,
the growth rate of a protective scale on any aluminide coating is
also small. Thus, adequate oxidation resistance should be provided
by any state of the art aluminide coatings, such as: chromium
aluminide, aluminide or two phase [PtAl2 + (Ni,Pt)Al] platinum
aluminide, all inward grown coatings made by pack cementation.
However, at high temperatures where the diffusion coefficients and
consequently the oxidation rate increase rapidly with increasing
temperature, only coatings which form high purity alumina (Al2O3)
scales are likely to provide adequate resistance to environmental
degradation. The presence of platinum in nickel aluminide has been concluded
to provide a number of thermodynamic and kinetic effects which
promote the formation of a slow growing, high purity protective
alumina scale. Consequently, the high temperature oxidation
resistance of platinum modified aluminide diffusion coatings
generally is better as compared to aluminide diffusion coatings not
containing platinum.In recent years, several limitations of the industry standard,
two phase [PtAl2 + (Ni,Pt)Al], inward grown platinum aluminide
coatings have been identified. First, the two phase coatings have
metastable phase assemblages and thicknesses, as demonstrated in
engine tests at both General Electric and Rolls-Royce. Second, the
two phase coatings are sensitive to thermal mechanical fatigue
(TMF) cracking in engine service, and the
