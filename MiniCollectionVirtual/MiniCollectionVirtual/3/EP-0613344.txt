<ABSTRACT>
A piece of jewellery has elongated longitudinal frame parts (1, 3) arranged in pairs next to each other at a constant distance from each other in the longitudinal direction and mutually linked by transverse strips (5), thus forming a rigid guiding frame. Each longitudinal frame part comprises an elongated base body (9) designed in particular as a tube with a ring-shaped, closed tubular wall, from which projects a guiding rib (11) that extends in the longitudinal direction up to the other longitudinal frame part. Jewellery elements (7) are freely movable on the guiding ribs. The circumferential profile of the base body (9) joins the guiding ribs (11) on both sides without undercuts. This design makes it possible to obtain mechanically stable guidance of the movable jewellery elements (7). In particular, jamming of the jewellery elements (7) due to dirt deposits in the area of the guiding ribs is avoided.

Piece of jewellery with elongated longitudinal frame parts (1, 3, 21; 1a, 3a) 
arranged in pairs next to one another at a constant distance from each other in 

longitudinal direction and mutually linked by transverse strips (5, 23, 5a) thus 
forming a rigid guiding frame, each elongated frame part (1, 3, 21; 1a, 3a) of 

which has an elongated base body (9; 9a), and with at least one jewellery 
element slide (15; 15a) engaging between the base bodies (9; 9a) of the 

longitudinal frame part pair (1, 3, 21; 1a, 3a), which slide is guided freely 
displaceably in longitudinal direction by guiding elements (17; 17a) on guiding 

surfaces (13; 13a) arranged in pairs on each base body (9; 9a) of the 
longitudinal frame part pair,
 
characterised in that the guiding surfaces (13; 13a) of each base body (9; 9a) 

are provided on opposite sides of a guiding rib (11; 11a) extending along the 
base body (9; 9a), and in that the base body (9; 9a) is tubular, the guiding rib 

(11; 11a) projecting from its closed ring-shaped tube wall and the base body (9), 
as viewed in section at right angles to its longitudinal direction has a 

circumferential profile on both sides of the guiding rib (11; 11a), with respect to 
its guiding surfaces (13; 13a), joining the guiding rib (11; 11a) without 

undercuts. 
Piece of jewellery according to claim 1, characterised in that the tube has a 
circular cross section or a polygonal, in particular quadrangular cross section. 
Piece of jewellery according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the base body 
(9) has a circumferential profile which connects on both sides of the guiding rib 

(11) with a profiled section at right angles to the guiding surface (13). 
Piece of jewellery according to claim 3, characterised in that the circumferential 
profile of the base body (9) projects equally far on both sides of the guiding rib. 
Piece of jewellery according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
longitudinal frame part (1a, 3a) has a two sided angular cross section the first  

 
side (9a) of which forms the base body and the second side (11a) of which 

forms the guiding rib. 
Piece of jewellery according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
guiding elements of the jewellery element slide are designed as a groove (17; 

17a) receiving the guiding rib (11; 11a) in a slide body (15; 15a) engaging 
between the base bodies (9;9a) of the longitudinal frame part pair (1, 3; 1a; 3a). 
Piece of jewellery according to claim 6, characterised in that the groove is 
designed as a circumferential groove (17) the groove base of which has a 

circular circumferential profile. 
Piece of jewellery according to claim 7, characterised in that slide body (15) has 
a circular cross section and forms a setting for a precious stone (19). 
Piece of jewellery according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that at 
least one of the base bodies (9) is joined to a further longitudinal frame part pair 

and has an additional guiding rib (11)
