<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a magnetic gasket particularly suitable for forming a seal between a fixed part and an openable part including in regions of curvilinear extension, for example between the body and door of a vehicle, of the type comprising an element for fixing to one of said parts and a seat housing a magnetized bar (11) of substantially rectangular cross-section in which said fixing element and said seat (8) for the magnetized bar are connected together by an extendable deformable tubular chamber, characterised in that said bar (11) is magnetized along at least one of the two shorter opposing sides (19, 19') of its substantially rectangular cross-section, said magnetized side facing when in its operating position the part with which contact is to be made for sealing purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Gaskets for motor vehicles are known, for example from Italian patent No. 
1.107.502 and Italian utility model No. 21692 B/83 or FR-U-2 545 145 in the name of the 
present applicant, which are suitable for forming a seal between 
the vehicle body and openable parts of the bodywork, such as 
doors, hatches, hood and the like when these are closed, of the 
type comprising a deformable profiled strip able to be fixed to 
the vehicle body by snapping-on, to said profiled strip there 
being connected along the straight regions of engagement between 
the vehicle body and the openable part a tubular section divided 
into a pair of separate adjacent chambers, one of which acts as a 
bellows air chamber and the other as a seat for magnetized 
material. These magnetic gaskets represent considerable progress over 
compression-operated gaskets without a magnetic seal, in terms 
both of improved sealing and of lesser pulling action to effect 
closure. There is however the technical problem of adapting this type of 
gasket to the varying range of shapes which the engagement region 
between the fixed and openable parts can assume, particularly in  
 
curvilinear regions, and especially when the radius of curvature 
is small. In very accentuated curvature regions there are 
considerable problems relating to deformation and squashing of the 
magnetic gaskets, which can result in loss of seal, formation of 
folds and points of discontinuity, or indeed breakage of the 
gasket after a certain time. European patent application No. 0519545 of the present 
applicant proposes a gasket able to solve this technical problem. It provides a magnetic gasket for forming a seal between a fixed 
part and an openable part in regions of curvilinear extension, for 
example in particular between the body and door of a vehicle, of 
the type comprising a profiled strip for fixing to said parts and 
a chamber housing a magnetized bar, in which said profiled fixing 
strip and said tubular chamber for the magnetized bar are 
connected together by an extendible deformable tubular chamber the 
opposing free walls of which are substantially curvilinear and 
curved in the same direction. An object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic gasket 
ideally suitable for mounting in curvilinear regions even of very 
small radius of curvature, without the deformation stresses to 
which it is subjected in any way compromising the seal. A further object is to provide the gasket with a continuous 
flexible magnetic bar to enable it to be shaped as

A magnetic gasket suitable for forming a seal 
between a fixed part and an openable part in regions of 

curvilinear extension, of said parts, in particular between the body (1) 
and door (3) of a vehicle, comprising an element (4) for fixing the 

magnetic gasket to said fixed part part and seat (8) housing a magnetized bar 
(11) of substantially rectangular cross-section in which said fixing 

element (4) and said seat (8) for the magnetized bar are connected 
together by an extendible deformable tubular chamber (10),
 
characterised in that said bar (11) is magnetized along at least one of 

the two shorter opposing sides (19, 19') of its substantially rectangular 
cross-section, said magnetized side facing when in its operating 

position the openable part (3) with which contact is to be made for sealing 
purposes. 
A magnetic basket as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said extendible tubular chamber has its opposing free walls (12, 13) 

substantially curvilinear and curved in the same direction, to 
hence achieve a substantially C-shaped cross-section. 
A magnetic gasket as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that that wall (13) of said walls of said extendible tubular chamber 

which when in its operating position faces inwards of the 
curvature of the engagement region between the fixed part and the 

movable part is essentially curved in its central part, its 
lateral portions (14, 15) being of rectilinear extension. 
A magnetic gasket as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that said seat for the magnetic bar is formed within said C-shaped 

cross-section of the extendible tubular chamber, in accordance  
 

with the arrangement shown in Figure 1. 
A magnetic gasket as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that said seat for the magnetic bar is formed outside said C-shaped 

cross-section of the extendible tubular chamber, in 
accordance with the arrangement shown in Figure 2. 
A magnetic gasket as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that said seat for the magnetic bar is formed along one of said 

lateral portions of rectilinear extension of that wall of the

fixed part, for example the vehicle body, is provided with a 
spacer (17). 
A magnetic basket as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said fixing element, said chamber for the magnetic bar and 

said extendible chamber are separate parts, and are joined 
together by a suitable means, such as an adhesive. 
A magnetic gasket as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said fixing element, said chamber for the magnetic bar and 

said extendible chamber are moulded in one piece or coextruded. 
A magnetic gasket as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
