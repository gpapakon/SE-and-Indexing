<ABSTRACT>
A polyvalent live vaccine is composed of a mixture of 5 types of attenuated 
virus suspensions, including a virus suspension prepared by culturing 

attenuated infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus No. 758-43 strain in 
bovine or swine tissue cultures; a virus suspension prepared by culturing 

attenuated bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD) virus No. 12-43 
strain in bovine or swine tissue cultures; a virus suspension prepared by 

culturing attenuated parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus BN-CE strain in chicken or 
bovine tissue cultures, or monkey kidney (vero) cells; a virus suspension 

prepared by culturing attenuated bovine RS virus rs-52 strain in hamster or 
bovine tissue cultures, or monkey kidney (vero) cells; and a virus suspension 

prepared by culturing attenuated bovine adeno 7 (AD7) virus TS-GT strain in 
goat or bovine tissue cultures, wherein said polyvalent live vaccine contains 

all the vaccines against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral 
diarrhea-mucosal disease, parainfluenza 3, bovine RS and bovine adeno 7, in 

order to achieve a greater efficiency of vaccination.

<DESCRIPTION>
A polyvalent live vaccine for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus infection, bovine viral
diarrhea-mucosal disease virus infection, parainfluenza 3 virus infection, bovine adeno 7 virus
infection.The present invention relates to a polyvalent live vaccine which combines
the vaccines for each of the following virus infections: infectious bovine
rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus infection, bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease
(BVD-MD) virus infection, parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus infection, bovine RS virus
infection and bovine adeno 7 (AD7) virus infection.Infection by the infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus causes
respiratory symptoms, conjunctivitis and vulvitis, etc. in cattle and abortion
for pregnant cows. The bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD) virus is
known to cause, in addition to respiratory symptoms, seriously fatal diarrhea,
and is a cause of persistent infection of fetus or calf when pregnant cows are
infected, as well as abnormalities of gestation such as abortion. The
parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus is a primary cause of respiratory symptoms. The
bovine RS virus also causes primarily respiratory disease, and symptoms usually
so severe and long-lasting that in adult cattle, sometimes death was observed. 
Further, infection by the bovine adeno 7 (AD7) virus is a cause of both
respiratory symptoms and diarrhea.These five types of pathogens are widely spread among herds of cattle in
Japan and other countries, causing repeated infections and outbreaks of the
diseases. They therefore constitute a constant threat to cattle in various
stages of growth, as well as in full grown cattle, as such outbreaks lead to
death, retarded growth, reduction in milk secretion, reduction in calf
production, etc., increasing the total damage given to the cattle industry. It
is here that the vaccines for these five types of viruses are most useful, and
that a polyvalent live vaccine would be most profitable economically.Each of the individual vaccines were developed with an object to prevent
these five types of diseases individually, and have been utilized to date. In
addition, utilization has been made in recent years of a trivalent live
vaccine, which includes the vaccines for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis
(IBR) virus infection, bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD) virus
infection, and parainfluenza 3 (PI3) virus infection
(see US patent No. 3,634,587).
Nevertheless, no mixture
has been developed which contains all 5 of the above mentioned vaccines in
sufficient concentration to be
