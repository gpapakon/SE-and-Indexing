<ABSTRACT>
A non-blocking hot melt adhesive mass is prepared by (a) lining a rigid mold with a plastic film, said film being meltable together with the adhesive composition and blendable into said molten adhesive composition, and said mold being a heat sink or being in contact with a heat sink; (b) pouring molten hot melt adhesive into the lined mold; and (c) allowing the molten hot melt adhesive to solidify.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for packaging hot melt adhesives
compositions and to the resulting packaged adhesive compositions.Hot melt adhesives which are generally applied while in the molten or
liquid state are solid at room temperature. Typically, these adhesives are
provided in the form of blocks and because of the nature of these materials,
particularly the pressure sensitive hot melts, there are problems associated
with handling and packaging them. The solid adhesive blocks not only stick
or adhere to hands or mechanical handling devices and to each other, but they
also pick up dirt and other contaminants. Additionally, certain applications
which require high tack formulations result in blocks that will deform or cold
flow unless supported during shipment. The need and advantages for providing
tackless or non-blocking hot melt adhesives are apparent and various ways of
accomplishing this have been developed.US-A-3,564,808 and FR-A-2,603,021
are both directed to methods for
packaging molten materials such as asphalt, wax or paraffin in plastic bags. According to the process of US-A-3,564,808 molten asphalt is
poured into a polyethylene bag at a temperature below the
melting point of the polyethylene. Thereby the asphalt is
pumped through a feed line provided with a quick closing
valve which operates in an open or closed position and which
is actuated by air from a further line. When the valve is in
an open position, molten asphalt passes through another line
and then into a plastic tube which is sealed at its bottom
end and positioned within a mold (cf. especially the Figure
of US-A-3,564,808). According to said document the pumping of
the molten asphalt is interrupted by the incorporation of
air. According to the process of FR-A-2 603 021 the filling
of the asphalt into a polyethylene bag takes place above the
melting point of polyethylene. According to that process it
is necessary to apply water between the wall of the mold and
the plastic bag. That means that according to US-A-3,546,808
as well as according to FR-A-2 603 021 there is no lining of
the mold with the thermoplastic film. Further, there is
neither in US-A-3,564,808 nor in FR-A-2 603 021 required that
the asphalt and the polyethylene are blendable or meltable
together. Japanese Patent 48-103635 discloses a
granular adhesive which is tacky at room temperature and coated or enveloped
with a non-tacky hot meltable material that is the same type or is miscible
or mixable with it.FR-A-2,544,654 discloses forming a
tackless hot melt

A method for packaging hot melt adhesive compositions comprising the
steps of:


a. lining a rigid mold with a single layer of a thermoplastic film
selected from the group consisting of ethylene based polymers, polyamides,

polybutadiene rubber, polyesters, polycarbonates, atactic poly-alpha-olefins,
thermoplastic polyacrylamides, polyacrylonitrile and copolymers thereof,

polymethyl pentene, polyphenylene sulfide, aromatic polyurethanes, styrene-acrylonitrile,
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, styrene-butadiene rubbers,

polyethylene terephthalate, polyphenylene sulfide and polyvinyl aromatic-rubber,

composition and blendable into said molten adhesive composition upon
subsequent use, and said mold being in contact with a refrigerant gas or

liquid;
b. pouring molten hot adhesive into the lined mold at a temperature

serves to prevent the plastic film from melting or deteriorating; and
