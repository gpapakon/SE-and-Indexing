<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sputtering method
in which a pulse-like DC voltage is applied, a film-deposition
method by sputtering, an apparatus for
obtaining sputtering and a power processing portion for
sputtering.A cathode for DC sputtering (hereinbelow, referred to
as sputtering) can not be used for forming a film of high
quality at a high deposition rate unless a problem of
abnormal discharge is overcome.Various causes are considered concerning the abnormal
discharge occurring around the cathode (hereinbelow,
referred to as arcing). As one of the causes, electric
charges are accumulated on a small insulating substance,
which is deposited or grown on the surface of a target
material, and the electric charges cause arcing to a
potentially opposite site, e.g. a substrate on which a
film is to be formed, an anode electrode, the inner wall
of a vacuum chamber or the surface of the target. The arcing occurs frequently in a case that an
insulating film is produced from a conductive target
material by reactive sputtering. When the arcing is
generated, arcing energy concentrates locally to a
portion of the target surface in a reactive gas
atmosphere, this forming an insulation or insulations,
whereby the arcing happens frequently in a series.
Accordingly, a stable glow discharge effective to
sputtering can not be maintained; a sputtering rate
becomes unstable and the production of films of uniform
quality is impossible. Occasionally, a substrate on
which a film is formed is damaged by arcing, or a
mechanical component constituting a cathode or a target
material or a cathode is molten by arcing.In order to avoid the above-mentioned disadvantage, a
method of using electric power of a high frequency such
as 13.56 MHz has been used.Recently, a technique of preventing arcing by using a
waveform proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication Nos. 148644/1993 and 331634/1993 or using a
device to obtain such waveform (the device is
commercialized as SPARC-LE by Advanced Energy in U.S.A.
Namely, the waveform having a frequency of several kHz
which is comparable to the effect obtained by a discharge
in 13.56 MHz by applying a pulse-like positive electric
potential of about 5 µs-10 µs is applied in a periodic
cycle to a cathode so that positive electric charges 
accumulated on a small insulating substance, which is
deposited or grown on the surface of a target material
are neutralized by attracting electrons in plasma.Recently, another technique of neutralization of a
potential difference on the target
