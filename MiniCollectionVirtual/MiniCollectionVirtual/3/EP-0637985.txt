<DESCRIPTION>
Devices for separating into solid material and 
liquid a mixture thereof which make use of movable filtering 
means are known in very many variations e.g. from FR-A-2194466. So-called 
horizontal belt filters and drum filters as well as so-called 
tilting pan or table filters are for instance known 
for specific applications, in particular for chemical 
processes, and washing processes are also carried out on the 
movable filtering means, for instance for washing out an 
acidic solvent from which plastic granules have formed. Two types of devices for separating into solid 
material and liquid a mixture thereof have been made 
commercially available by applicant. The first type relates 
to a device provided with a reciprocally movable suction box 
disposed beneath an endless movable filter cloth. Here an 
extremely good seal is obtained between suction box and 
filter cloth so that the liquid is drawn out of the mixture 
with sufficient suction force. The second type relates to a 
device provided with a belt of sealing material such as 
rubber moving along with the endless filter cloth. In both the above stated types of separating 
device it is important to have the separation take place as 
efficiently and optimally as possible. Because the 
composition of the mixture can vary during the separating 
process the quantity of liquid on the cake of solid material 
changes. At the beginning and end of separating steps 
possibly different liquids may be mixed together. In 
practice, samples are usually taken from the solid material 
remaining behind on the movable filtering means in order to 
establish whether separating and/or washing has been taken 
place to a sufficient extent.  
 In EP-A-0316997 photodetectors are disclosed, which are provided on 
descrete positions along a gravity filter. In an industrial 
environment such photodetectors are liable to malfunction, 
because the glass before such photodetector can easily become 
contaminated.  
 The present invention has for its object to 
optimalize the above stated separating process and 
separating devices, that is, to impose and maintain the  
 
quality standard requirements for the solid material and 
liquid for disposal. The present invention provides an apparatus for 
separating into solid material and liquid a mixture thereof, 
comprising: 
movable filtering means for filtering the 
mixture; feed means for supplying the mixture onto the 
filtering means; suction means for drawing off liquid from the 
mixture through the filtering means; and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) for separating into solid 
material and liquid a mixture thereof, comprising: 


movable filtering means (3, 4, 5) for filtering 
the mixture; 
feed means (6) for supplying the mixture onto the 
filtering means (3, 4, 5); and 
suction means (9) for drawing off liquid from the 
mixture through the filtering means (5); characterized by 
measuring means (11, 12, 13) for continuously 
measuring a position of an edge of a liquid pool on the 

filtering means (3, 4, 5), said measuring means (11, 12, 
13) comprising a capacitive sensor (11, 12) extending on 

or shortly above the filtering means (3, 4, 5). 
An apparatus (1) according to claim 1, wherein 
the capacitive sensor comprises a first (11) and a second 

electrode (12) wherein the first electrode (11) is 
disposed in the area where the mixture is supplied by the 

feed means (6) and wherein the second electrode (12) 
extends from position close to the feed means (6) to a 

predetermined position at a distance from the feed means 
(6) in the direction of movement of the filtering means 

(3, 4, 5). 
An apparatus (1) according to claim 1 or 2, 
provided with control means (13) for controlling the 

movement of the filtering means (3, 4, 5), the feed of 
the mixture and/or the suction force of the suction means 

(9). 
An apparatus (1) according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the filtering means (3, 4, 5) comprises an 

endless filter cloth (5). 
An apparatus according to anyone of claims 1-4, 
wherein a reciprocally movable suction box (9) forming  

 
part of the suction means is arranged under the filtering 

means (3, 4, 5). 
An apparatus as claimed in any of the claims 1-5, 
provided with treating means arranged beyond the second 

electrode (12) for further treatment of the solid 
material situated on the filtering means (3, 4, 5). 
A method for separating into solid material and 
liquid a mixture thereof, comprising the following steps: 


moving filtering means (3, 4, 5) for filtering the 
mixture; 
supplying the mixture onto the filtering means (3, 
4, 5); and 
drawing off liquid from the mixture through the 
filtering means (3, 4, 5) by suction, characterized by continuously 

measuring the position of an edge of the liquid pool on 
the filtering means (3, 4, 5) and continuously 

controlling the speed of movement of the filtering means, 
the feed of the mixture and/or the suction force 

dependent on the result of the measuring.
