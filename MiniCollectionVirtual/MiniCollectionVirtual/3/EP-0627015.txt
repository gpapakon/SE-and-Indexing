<DESCRIPTION>
This Invention relates to cast composite material, 
and, more particularly, to the preparation of such cast 
composite materials having an Al-Mg matrix and a 
reinforcing particulate such as aluminum oxide that is 
reactive with magnesium. Cast composite materials are conventionally formed by 
melting a matrix alloy in a reactor and then adding short, 
discontinuous particles. The mixture is vigorously mixed 
to encourage wetting of the matrix alloy to the particles, 
and after a suitable mixing time the mixture is cast into 
molds or forms. The mixing is conducted while minimizing 
the introduction of gas into the mixture. The resulting 
composite materials have the particulate reinforcement 
distributed throughout a matrix of an alloy composition. Such cast composite materials are much less expensive 
to prepare than other types of metal-matrix composite 
materials such as those produced by powder metallurgical 
technology and infiltration techniques. Composite 
materials produced by this approach, as described in US 
Patents 4,759,995, 4,786,467, and 5,028,392, have enjoyed 
commercial success in only a few years after their first 
introduction. Desirably, the cast composite materials have fully 
wetted particles, few voids, and a generally uniform 
microstructure. Complete wetting is necessary to realize 
the full composite strength and other mechanical 
properties. Equally important is the need to avoid the 
formation of deleterious phases that may adversely affect 
the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the 
finished cast composite material. The presence of magnesium in the aluminum-alloy 
matrix of cast composite materials reinforced with 
aluminum oxide particulate has posed a significant 
problem. Magnesium on the order of 0.5 percent or more is  
 
required in many aluminum alloys to achieve their full 
strengths during aging treatments. Aluminum matrix alloys 
with such large amounts of magnesium, on the order of 0.5 
percent or more of the matrix, readily wet aluminum oxide 
particulate, but may also react with the particulate to 
produce the brittle spinel phase, MgAl2O4. The formation 
of the spinel phase is the principal cause of a reduction 
in matrix alloy magnesium content, which in turn prevents 
the matrix alloy from reaching its full strength potential 
during subsequent aging treatments. The amount of spinel 
formed is dependent upon three factors: the magnesium 
content of the matrix alloy, the mixing temperature, and 
the mixing time. Under normal mixing conditions,

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing a composite material, 
comprising the steps of: 


providing a first mixture comprising a molten 

aluminum-base matrix alloy having at least 4 percent 
by weight magnesium, and a mass of discontinuous 

reinforcing particles that are not soluble in the molten 
matrix alloy and are of a composition capable of forming a 

spinel phase at the particle-matrix interface, the matrix 
alloy being wetted to the particles; 
diluting the first mixture to reduce the 
magnesium content of the matrix alloy to less than 4 

percent by weight magnesium, to produce a second mixture; 
and 
casting the second mixture. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the matrix alloy 
is wetted to the particles by mixing the molten aluminum-base 

matrix alloy having at least 4 percent by weight 
magnesium and the mass of discontinuous reinforcing 

particles that are not soluble in the molten matrix alloy 
until the matrix alloy is wetted to the particles and the 

particles are distributed throughout the volume of the 
molten alloy. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the second 
mixture has at least 5 percent by volume of particles. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the second 
mixture has from 5 to 25 percent by volume of particles. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the magnesium 
content of the first mixture matrix alloy is from 4 to 7 

weight percent magnesium. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the magnesium 
content of the second mixture matrix alloy is from 0.5 to 

3 weight percent magnesium. 
The method of claim 2, wherein a vacuum is 
applied to the first mixture during the step of mixing.  

 
The method of claim 2, wherein the step of 
diluting is accomplished by adding aluminum to the first 

mixture. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the reinforcing 
particles are of a material that chemically reacts with 

magnesium. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the reinforcing 
particles contain aluminum oxide. 
The method of claim 2, including the additional 
steps, after the step of mixing the first mixture and 

before the step of diluting the first mixture, of (a) 
casting the first mixture; and thereafter (b) remelting 

the first mixture. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the mixing is 
conducted with shearing of the particles and the matrix 

alloy past each to promote wetting, while minimizing the 
introduction of any gas into the material being mixed and 

while minimizing the retention of any gas within the 
material being mixed.
