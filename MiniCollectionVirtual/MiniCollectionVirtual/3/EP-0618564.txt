<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the active control of the noise transmitted into a space (21) by a noisy source (20) outside the space and a system for the implementation of this method. It consists in picking up the noise produced by the noisy source and in electronically generating counter-noise, that is to say noise in phase opposition with the noise from the source so as to cancel it out, characterised in that the counter-noise is added to the source noise in a region situated between the noisy source and the space so as to form a quiet barrier preventing the transmission of the source noise towards the space. Application in particular to the railway sector.
