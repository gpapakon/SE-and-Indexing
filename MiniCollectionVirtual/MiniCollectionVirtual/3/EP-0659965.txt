<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent a car from being broken into 
or stolen, the invention proposes a security device which 

is formed by a lock fitted slidably in each door of the 
car, which lock is connected to and driven by a drive 

element (12a, 12b). The lock can be slid by means of said 

drive element so that it engages with or is disconnected 
from an opening disposed in the frame of the car door in 

question. For this purpose, the drive elements are 
accommodated in an electrical circuit which also contains 

the voltage supply of the vehicle and a switch element. 
The security device can be turned on by means of said 

switch element, in order to lock all car doors securely. 
This switch element is therefore situated outside the 

passenger compartment. In another embodiment the security 
device is suitable in particular for the loading door of 

a lorry, which door has two locking rods (31,34; 32,35) 
which are axially slidable in opposite directions to each 

other, and which each interact with an opening disposed 
in the doorframe thereof. This embodiment is 

distinguished by the fact that each locking rod is 
connected to a drive element (12a, 12b), which drive 

elements are disposed in opposite directions in order to 
move the two rods simultaneously in opposite directions. 

The two drive elements are again accommodated in a 
control circuit (50) containing a voltage supply and a 

switch element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
securing doors against unauthorized opening thereof, in 
particular for the doors of a motor vehicle, for example 
the doors of a car or the rear doors of a lorry, but also 
the loading doors of a container. However, the device can 
also be used advantageously for securing roll-down 
shutters or doors of factories and the like. A major aim of the invention is the provision of 
an additional locking device which, apart from the usual 
closure of the door, also offers an effective security 
measure to protect the vehicle or the container from 
being broken into and/or the vehicle itself from being 
stolen. The theft of a car generally occurs either 
through the lock of a door being forced or through a 
window being smashed and the door then being opened from 
the inside. The security systems for vehicles or the 
alarm systems known until now are electronic systems 
which produce sound and/or light signals. These systems 
have the disadvantage that they are fairly expensive. 
Moreover, their effectiveness is limited, since the 
public tends not to react or is afraid to react when the 
alarm goes off. Besides, such alarm systems regularly go 
off accidentally. The object of the invention is then to provide a 
security system which offers effective protection against 
break-in or theft, without said system having the disadvantages 
of the known alarm systems. This object is 
achieved according to the invention by a device with the 
characteristics indicated in Claim 1. Claim 2 indicates 
a further effective development of the invention. The invention is in fact based on the idea that 
if the doors of the vehicle are locked in such a way that  
 
they cannot be opened from the inside and cannot be 
forced either, stealing the vehicle becomes much more 
difficult, if not impossible. Another aim of the invention is the provision of 
a security device which is intended in particular for the 
loading doors of a lorry. Such a device is distinguished 
by the features indicated in Claim 3. The security device 
in this case can advantageously be connected to a control 
circuit, which can ensure that said device is turned on 
automatically after the loading doors are closed. This 
means that it is impossible to leave the loading doors 
unsecured by mistake. Claims 4 - 6 give expedient further details of 
this embodiment. The invention is explained in greater detail with 
reference to the drawing, in which:

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device for securing doors of a motor vehicle, 
characterized in that each door of the vehicle to be 

secured is provided with an axially movable locking bolt 
(3) which interacts with an opening (6) disposed in the 

corresponding doorframe (5), which locking bolt is 
connected to a drive element (12) disposed in said door, 

in order to move the locking bolt out of a non-working 
position into a working position, in which the locking 

bolt engages in the opening of the doorframe, which drive 
element is connected to a control circuit (18) containing 

the batteries (19) present on the vehicle and a switch 
element (20), which switch element is situated outside 

the driver's cab of the vehicle. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the locking bolt is connected to the end of the 

inner cable of a flexible coaxial cable (9), while the 
other end of the inner cable is connected to a linear 

reciprocating element (14) of the drive element. 
Device according to Claim 1, intended for the 
loading door of a lorry, which door is provided with two 

axially slidable locking rods (34, 35) lying essentially 
in line with each other, and each interacting with an 

opening disposed in the doorframe, characterized in that 
each locking rod is connected to a drive element (12a, 

12b), which drive elements are disposed in opposite 
directions, in order to slide both rods simultaneously 

outwards out of their non-working position into the 
locked position, in which the two rods engage in their 

respective openings, and vice versa, which drive elements 
are accommodated in a control circuit containing the 

batteries (51) of the vehicle and a switch element (56). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the control circuit contains a control module (50) 

to which the battery of the vehicle (51), the drive 
elements (M), a door switch (55) and the switch element 

(56) are connected. 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterizedin that the switch element is formed by the contact lock 
of the vehicle. 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the switch element is formed by a switch which 

can be remote-controlled by means of a coded radio 
signal. 
Device according to the preceding Claims 3-6, 
characterized in that both locking rods are 

interconnected by a disc (33) and in that one (32) of 
locking rods is provided with a pin (47), said pin 

cooperating with the lip (46) of a lock (45) which lock 
can be operated from outside of the door in order to move 

said locking rods into their non-working position. 
Device according to Claim 7 characterized in that 
the disc (33) is provided with a retaining element (37, 

38) so that the the locking rods can not move 
unintendedly.
