<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an MR method for two-dimensional or three-dimensional imaging of an examination region, in which a set of raw data is repeatedly measured, it being possible to reconstruct an image of the examination region from each set, and the raw data of a set being picked up with various measuring parameters and different sets containing raw data picked up with the same measuring parameters. In this case, improved temporal resolution is achieved in that, for producing an image, which represents the examination region at a choosable point in time, from at least two sets of raw data, a set of auxiliary data is constructed, in that the auxiliary data is derived by interpolation of raw data collected using, in each case, the same measuring parameters but at different measuring time instants, in that the weighting with which the raw data are input into the interpolation is larger for smaller time separation between the corresponding measuring time point and the selectable time point, and in that the image of the examination region is reconstructed from the set of auxiliary data.

An MR method for the two-dimensional or three-dimensional imaging of
an examination zone, in which a set of raw data is repeatedly measured and an image of

the examination zone can be reconstructed from each set, in which the raw data of a set
is acquired with different measurement parameters, and in which different sets contain

raw data acquired with the same measurement parameters, 
characterized in that
 in order
to produce an image representing the examination zone at a selectable instant (t
0
) or in a
selectable slice, a set of auxiliary data (H(ϕ
k
,t
0
)) is formed from at least two sets of raw
data (R(
ϕ
k
,t
1
), R(ϕ
k
,t
2
)), the auxiliary data being derived by interpolation from the raw
data acquired with the same measurement parameters (ϕ
k
), but at different measurement
instants (t
1
, t
2
), or derived for different measurement slices, that the weight (g
k
) applied
to the raw data entering the interpolation is greater as the distance in time between the

associated measurement instant and the selectable instant, or between the measurement
slice and the selected slice, is smaller, and that the image of the examination zone is

reconstructed from the set of auxiliary data.
An MR method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 several sets
of auxiliary data are generated, which sets represent the examination zone at different,

preferably equidistant instants, and that the images reconstructed therefrom are
displayed as a sequence of images.
An MR method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
examination zone is imaged by way of an MR method in which a uniform, steady

magnetic field acts on an examination zone, initially a first sequence which comprises at
least one RF pulse acting on the examination zone in order to generate a first set of raw

data, the MR signal thus generated being read in the presence of a magnetic gradient
field having a gradient extending in a first direction, said first sequence being succeeded

by further, similar sequences, the direction of the gradient being varied from one
sequence to another until all directions have been traversed, a first set of raw data being

produced by one-dimensional Fourier transformation over the MR signal acquired
during these sequences, and the series of sequences being repeated at least once in order 

to obtain at least one further set of raw data.
An MR method for generating MR images as claimed in one of the
Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 an object (10) to be examined is moved relative to
the examination zone during the examination, sets of raw data being continuously

measured during the movement, at least one set of auxiliary data being formed from
said raw data, and a respective MR image being reconstructed from said auxiliary data.
An MR apparatus for carrying out the method as claimed in one of the
preceding Claims, comprising


a magnet for generating a uniform, steady magnetic field,
a gradient coil system for generating a magnetic gradient field whose gradient
can be varied in respect of magnitude and/or direction,
at least one RF coil system for generating RF pulses or for receiving MR
signals,
means for generating raw data from the MR signals,
a control unit for controlling said means and coil systems so that several sets of
raw data are formed,
an interpolation unit for generating at least one set of auxiliary data from each
time two or more sets of raw data, and
a reconstruction unit for reconstructing an MR image of the examination zone
from a set of auxiliary data.
