<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for preparing polyketones 
comprising,

 
   in a first step contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide and one 

or more olefins in the presence of a suitable catalyst to give a 
polyketone prepolymer in a particulate form which incorporates said 

catalyst,
 

   isolating the polyketone prepolymer under conditions such that 
the catalyst remains substantially chemically bound to the polyketone 

prepolymer, and
 

   in a second step contacting carbon monoxide with one or more 
olefins in the presence of the polyketone prepolymer. 
The preferred catalyst is a palladium catalyst. Isolation of 
the prepolymer is preferably carried out at a temperature at least 

10°C below the polymerisation temperature. 
Use of a prepolymer results in reduced reactor fouling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
polyketones by reacting one or more olefins with carbon monoxide in
the presence of a suitable palladium
catalyst. In particular, the invention relates to the use of a
prepolymer to catalyse the process.It is known to produce polyketones which are linear alternating
polymers of (a) one or more olefins and (b) carbon monoxide, by a
liquid phase (slurry) process in which the olefins and carbon
monoxide are polymerised together in methanol, ethanol or propanol
solvent in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Such a process,
which is disclosed in more detail in, for example, EP 121965 and EP
314309, typically employs a catalyst derived from (a) a palladium
compound (b) a source of an anion which is either non-coordinating or
only weakly coordinating to palladium and (c) a bisphosphine of
formula R1R2P-R-PR3R4 where R1 to R4 are independently aryl groups
which can optionally be polar substituted and R is a divalent organic
bridging group such as -(CH2)n-(n = 2-6). A source of the anion is
typically its conjugate acid.However, the problem with carrying out the process of the prior
art, particularly in alcohol based slurry phase, is that fouling of
the reactor occurs. Fouling takes the form of a thin layer of paper-like
material which generally coats all wetted metal surfaces of the
reactor and upon which particulate product is subsequently deposited.
This fouling would severely restrict the operation of the process
particularly in the preferred continuous mode. A number of approaches to overcoming the fouling problem have
been tried. Soluble additives can be used. However, these are not
very successful at reducing the fouling and in addition increase the
complexity of the catalyst system. Seeding the reactor at the start
of the process has the effect of decreasing the level of fouling. In
particular, the seed material can itself be a polyketone. However,
the fouling is decreased, but not eliminated by such an approach.It has now been found that reactor fouling can be considerably
reduced or eliminated altogether by using a "living" polymer
(prepolymer) to catalyse the process for preparing polyketones.Thus according to the present invention there is provided a
process for preparing polyketones comprising,
in a first step contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide and one
or more olefins in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst to give a
polyketone prepolymer in a particulate form which incorporates said
catalyst,isolating the polyketone prepolymer
