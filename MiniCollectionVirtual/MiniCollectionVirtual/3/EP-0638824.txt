<ABSTRACT>
An electrooptic target detection apparatus for acquiring and measuring airborne targets has an imaging sensor (10), for example a video and/or infrared camera (11, 12), and a laser rangefinder (13) which emits a laser measurement beam for range measurement. The imaging sensor (10) and laser rangefinder (13) are arranged together on a stabilisation platform (14) which is driven by a drive unit (15) in order to pivot it in elevation ( epsilon ) and azimuth ( alpha ). In order to dispense with high-power lasers and to use cost-effective laser transmitters having comparatively low laser energy in the laser rangefinder (13), which is nevertheless intended to provide reliable range measurements from long ranges even for airborne targets having a small area, an automatic target tracking unit (tracker 20) is connected to the imaging sensor (10), which unit permanently supplies correction signals (x,y) corresponding to the offset of the target from the imaging sensor axis (24), which correction signals (x, y) are used to track the stabilisation platform (14) by means of the drive unit (15). There is a tolerance field (29) around the axis (24) of the imaging sensor (10), and a comparator unit (30) compares the relative target position with the tolerance area (29) and, if the target position is outside the tolerance area (29), generates an inhibit signal to prevent triggering of the laser rangefinder (13).

Electrooptical targeting device for tracking airborne
targets, with an image sensor (10), e.g. video and/or

infrared camera (11, 12), and with a laser range finder
(13) emitting a measurement laser beam, which are

arranged jointly on a stabilisation platform (14), and
with a drive unit (15) driving the stabilisation

platform (14) to swivel it in elevation (ε) and azimuth
(α), characterised in that an automatic target tracking

unit (tracker 20) is connected to the image sensor (10),
which permanently tracks the position of the target in

relation to the optical axis (24) of the image sensor
(10), and delivers correction signals (x, y)

corresponding to the deviation of the target from the
image sensor axis (24); that the correction signals (x,

y) are supplied to the drive unit (15) in a manner so as
to compensate for the target deviation for following the

stabilisation platform (14); that a tolerance field (29)
is located around the axis (24) of the image sensor

(10), the field area of which is equal to or smaller
than the cross-section of the measurement laser beam at

the target location; and that a comparison unit (30)
compares the relative target location with the tolerance

field (29) and, when the target lies outside the
tolerance field (29), generates a blocking signal to

block actuation of the laser range finder (13).
Targeting device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that a gate (33) is arranged in a signal line (28) for

random actuation of a distance measurement through the
laser range finder (13); and that the blocking signal

lies at the control input of the gate (33).
Targeting device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the target tracking unit (tracker 

20) determines as relative target position the
coordinates (Δx, Δy) of the centre of gravity (23) of

the target surface (22) within an orthogonal coordinate
system (25), the origin of which coincides with the

optical axis (24) of the image sensor (10); that the
tolerance field (29) is fixed by two field coordinates

(x
1
, y
1
) in the orthogonal coordinate system (25); and
that the comparison unit (30) compares each centre of

gravity coordinate (Δx, Δy) with the allocated field
coordinates (x
1
, y
1
) and when they are exceeded,
generates the blocking signal.
Targeting device according to Claim 3, characterised in
that a respective correction signal (x, y) corresponding

to the horizontal coordinate (Δx) of the target surface
centre of gravity (23) and corresponding to the vertical

coordinate (Δy) of the target surface centre of gravity
(23) lies at separate outputs (201, 202) of the target

tracking unit (tracker 20); that the comparison unit
(30) has two comparators (31, 32) each with two inputs

(311, 312 and 321, 322) and an output (313 and 323);
that the outputs (201, 202) of the target tracking unit

(tracker 20) are respectively connected to an input (311
and 321), the other input (312 or 322) of which is

furnished with a threshold value corresponding to the
field coordinate (x
1
, y
1
) of the tolerance field (29);
and that the outputs (313, 323) of both comparators (31,

32) are connected to the control input of the gate (33).
Targeting device according to Claim 4, characterised in
that the gate (33) has an AND circuit (35), the output

of which is connected to a measurement actuation input
(131) of the laser range finder (13) and an input of

which is connected to the signal line (28); and that the 
other input of the AND circuit (35) forming the control

input of the gate (33) is connected to each output (313,
323) of the comparators (31, 32) via an OR circuit (34).
