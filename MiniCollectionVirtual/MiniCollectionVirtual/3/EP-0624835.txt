<ABSTRACT>
A servo pressure regulator has inlet (1) and outlet (2) chambers with a separating wall having an opening with a valve seat (5) engaged by a poppet (6). The poppet is supported on a rod (8) coupled to a diaphragm (9) and a spring (10) normally holds the valve closed. Within the top section of the valve body, an electromagnetic actuator (12-15) is energised to lift the armature clear of the poppet (6) against the action of a spring. In doing so fluid is passed through channels (22,27) and a restrictor (26) to the underside of the main diaphragm. The poppet opens until a force balance is achieved. A separate stage (34) controls venting when the valve closes.

Servo pressure regulator comprising: 

a) a main valve closure member (6) spring-biased (10) in closing direction and 
governing the flow channel between an inlet chamber (1) and an outlet chamber 

(2); 
b) a solenoid operator (9, 18) comprising a control pressure chamber (18) which 
actuates upon the main closure member via a valve rod (8), and whereat the 

control pressure acts upon the main valve closure member in opening direction; 
c) a solenoid (12 to 15), whose armature (14) is spring-biased and engages the main 
valve closure member (6) when the solenoid (12) is deenergized and which then 

maintains the main valve closure member in the closed position; 
d) a connecting line (27) between the inlet chamber (1) and the control pressure 
chamber (18) of the diaphragm operator (9, 18), which connecting line (27) 

comprises a first throttle (26) and can be closed by the armature (14); 
 
   
characterized in that :
e) the connecting line (27) is located stationarily; and 
f) the portion ofthe connecting line (27) between inlet chamber (1) and first throttle 
(26) communicates with the outlet chamber (2) via a stationary connecting channel 

(39) having a second throttle (25). 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized by
a) a bleed valve (34) which is connected between the outlet chamber (2) and the 
control pressure chamber (18) and is controlled by a spring-biased diaphragm; and 
b) means (37, 38) for adjusting the spring-bias of the bleed valve (34). 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
connecting channel (39) is connected in parallel to a series circuit consisting of the 

bleed valve (34) and the first throttle (26).  
 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 
the inlet (30) ofthe connecting line (27), which is located close to the armature, is 

formed by at least one hole (30, 31) in the armature. 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
armature at its front surface has a pocket hole (30) and further has at least one radial 

bore (31) porting into said pocket hole. 
Pressure regulator according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized 
in that
 the control diaphragm (9) abuts against the valve rod (8) via a 
transmission spring (11). 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
stroke ofthe control diaphragm (9) in opening direction of the main valve (5, 6) is 

limited by at least one abutment (40) to a value which is smaller than the completely 
pressed together length of the transmission spring (11). 
Pressure regulator according to one ofthe Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
in that
: 

a) the inlet chamber (1) of the main valve (5, 6) on the one side is closed by a plate 
(19) comprising one hole (24, 23) each for the first (26) and the second (25) 

throttle and further comprising another hole (22) as part of the connecting line 
(27); and 
b) the connecting line (27) is formed either in said plate (19) or between this plate and 
an external closing plate (28) or is formed in said outer closing plate. 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 
the inlet (30) at the side ofthe armature is sealed against the housing (3) by means of a 

diaphragm (21). 
Pressure regulator according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the 
diaphragm (21) is part of a resilient sealing plate (20) which has holes and is provided 

between the plate (19) and the housing (3).  
 
Pressure regulator according to one ofthe Claims 2 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 an adjusting screw (38) is provided as the adjusting means for the spring 
bias of the bleed valve (34). 
Pressure regulator according to one ofthe Claims 2 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 a solenoid or moving coil operator is provided as adjusting means for the 
spring bias of the bleed valve (34).
