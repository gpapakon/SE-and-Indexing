<ABSTRACT>
A suction mold has a central suction chamber (C1) 
having a flat shaping surface area (31) and a pair of 

opposite side suction chambers (C2, C3) disposed one on 
each side of the central suction chamber (C1) and having 

respective curved shaping surface areas. First, a 
vacuum is developed in the central suction chamber (C1) 

to attract a central area of the sheet of glass (G) 
against the flat shaping surface area (31) thereof, and 

then a vacuum is developed in the opposite side suction 
chambers (C2, C3) to attract opposite side areas of the 

sheet of glass (G) respectively against the curved 
shaping surface areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of bending
a sheet of glass with a suction mold.There has heretofore been known a method of bending
a sheet of glass by drawing, under suction, the sheet of
glass that has been heated nearly to the softening point
thereof against the surface of a suction mold for thereby
shaping the sheet of glass complementarily to the surface
configuration of the suction mold. Such a method is disclosed
in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 62-270429
and Japanese patent publication No. 62-30136.According to the method disclosed in the former
publication, a heated sheet of glass is floated by air and
pressed against the shaping surface of a suction mold, and
then a vacuum is developed by the suction mold to draw the
heated sheet of glass against the shaping surface of the suction
mold to bend the heated sheet of glass to a desired
shape complementary to the shaping surface.According to the method disclosed in the latter
publication, a heated sheet of glass is lifted by a ring mold
and pressed against the shaping surface of a suction mold,
and then a vacuum is developed by the suction mold to draw
the heated sheet of glass against the shaping surface of the
suction mold to bend the heated sheet of glass to a desired
shape complementary to the shaping surface.In the above prior arrangements, a large amount of
air may flow into the suction mold through suction holes that
are defined in the region of the suction mold which is positioned
out of intimate contact with the glass sheet, thereby
reducing the forces with which the glass sheet is held
against the shaping surface under suction.To solve the above problem, a suction mold is divided
into a plurality of chambers, and different suction
pressures are developed in the respective chambers according
to other conventional arrangements disclosed in Japanese 
laid-open utility model publication No. 63-27443 and
Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 59-232926.
These disclosed suction molds also suffer disadvantages
because suction pressures are simultaneously developed
in the chambers.More specifically, FIG. 8A of the accompanying
drawings shows a conventional suction mold 100 having a
downwardly convex shaping surface. In FIG. 8A, a heated
glass sheet G has its peripheral edge pressed against
the peripheral edge of the shaping surface of the
suction mold 100 by a ring mold 101. When the suction
mold 100 starts drawing the heated glass sheet G under
suction pressures developed therein, air may locally not
be removed from and

<CLAIMS>
A method of bending a sheet of glass heated nearly
to the softening point thereof with a suction mold (3)

including a plurality of separate suction chambers (C1,
C2, C3) having respective shaping surface areas,

comprising moving the suction mold (3) against the glass
sheet such that each of the plurality of suction

chambers (C1,C2,C3) simultaneously approaches the glass
sheet into a position in which the glass sheet can be

attracted towards each of the suction chambers by
developing a vacuum therein, characterised by the step

of:

developing vacuums in selected ones of the suction
chambers (C1,C2,C3) at different times to attract the

sheet of glass successively against the shaping surface
areas thereof for thereby bending the sheet of glass

complementarily to the shaping surface areas.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said suction
chambers (C1,C2,C3) include a central suction chamber

(C1) having a flat shaping surface area and a pair of
opposite side suction chambers (C2,C3) disposed one on

each side of said central suction chamber (C1) and
having respective curved shaping surface areas, said

step of developing vacuums comprising the steps of:

developing a vacuum in said central suction chamber
(C1) to attract a central area of the sheet of glass

against the flat shaping surface area thereof; and
thereafter, developing a vacuum in said opposite
side suction chambers (C2,C3) to attract opposite side

areas of the sheet of glass respectively against the
curved shaping surface areas.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
step of developing vacuums comprises the step of 

developing different vacuums in the suction chambers
(C1,C2,C3).
A method of shaping a sheet of glass heated nearly
to the softening point therof with the shaping surface

areas of a plurality of separate suction chambers
(C1,C2,C3) defined in a suction mold (3), the shaping

surface areas having suction holes (32) defined therein,
comprising moving the suction mold (3) against the glass

sheet such that each of the plurality of suction
chambers (C1,C2,C3) simultaneously approaches the glass

sheet into a position in which the glass sheet can be
attracted towards each of the suction chambers by

developing a vacuum therein, characterised by the steps
of:


introducing a vacuum into one of the suction
chambers (C1) to attract an area of the sheet of glass

against the shaping surface area of said one of the
suction chambers through the suction holes (32) thereof;

and
thereafter, introducing a vacuum into another of
the suction chambers (C2,C3) to attract another area of

the sheet of glass against the shaping surface area of
said other of the suction chambers (C2,C3) through the

suction holes (32) thereof.
