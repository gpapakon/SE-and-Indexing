<ABSTRACT>
A hose, particularly a vehicle exhaust hose, comprising an 
inner, thin rubber-coated fabric and an outer helically-shaped 

reinforcement which functions to maintain the 
intended cross-sectional shape of the hose and which is 

adhered to the surface of the rubber-coated fabric. The 
hose is characterized in that the helically-shaped reinforcement 

has an inner core of plastic material having a 
predetermined, relatively high melting point, and at least 

one layer outside the core, this layer being made of a 
similar plastic material. The layer which lies nearest the 

outer surface of the core is bonded adhesively thereto, and 
any further layers that may be included are bonded adhesively 

to one another in a similar fashion. The outer layer 
is comprised of a plastic material whose melting point is 

lower than or equal to the melting point of at least the 
nearest lying layer or the core, whichever is applicable. 

The contact region between the rubber-coated fabric and the 
plastic helix has an adhesion facilitating structure with 

intimate contact between the plastic helix and the rubber-coated 
fabric and a partially melted outer plastic layer. 

The invention also relates to a method for producing the 
hose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hose, and then particularly, 
but not exclusively, to a vehicle exhaust hose, 
comprising an inner thin, rubber-coated fabric and an outer 
helically wound reinforcement which is intended to maintain 
the original cross-sectional shape of the hose. Hoses that are provided with an external reinforcement on 
a thin rubber-coated fabric are known to the art and are 
used mainly to conduct the waste exhaust gases of motor 
vehicles, primarily the exhaust gases of private cars and 
trucks or lorries, for instance in vehicle workshops and 
vehicle testing institutions. For use as a vehicle exhaust 
hose, there is required a thin hose which has a relatively 
large cross-sectional area so as to ensure that the hose 
will only suffer from the hot gases to the smallest 
possible extent, these gases typically having a temperature 
of up to about 180Â°C. A thin hose of large cross-sectional 
area has been found the best type of hose in this connection, 
because the hot exhaust gases are cooled rapidly by 
such a hose. The problem with hoses of this nature, 
however, is that they tend to be squeezed together or bent 
so as to prevent the passage of exhaust gases through the 
hose, or even to render such passage impossible. It is 
therefore necessary to provide the hose with some form of 
means which will maintain the intended cross-sectional 
shape of the hose as far as possible, even when the hose is 
bent (curved) or subjected to external mechanical pressure. 
In the case of commercially available exhaust hoses, this 
is achieved by means of an external helix which is normally 
comprised of nylon-type plastic material and which is more 
shape-stable than the rubber-coated fabric. Such a hose is disclosed in SE-A-445 133. The plastic 
helix is completely enclosed by a rubber layer, which forms 
a passageway in which the plastic helix is loosely inserted. 
The rubber is intended to enable the helix to be joined  
 
to the fabric and the outer rubber layer in the helix is 
thus vulcanized to the rubber-coated fabric. No other 
solution to the problem of providing a connection between 
the reinforcement, i.e. the plastic helix, and the thin 
rubber-coated fabric is available or has been proposed. One 
serious drawback with a hose of this construction, however, 
is that it is relatively expensive in manufacture, since 
manufacture of the hose requires many complicated manufacturing 
stages, among other things. The object of the present invention is to provide a hose 
comprising an

<CLAIMS>
A hose, particularly a vehicle exhaust hose, comprising 
an inner, thin rubber-coated fabric and an outer helically-shaped 

reinforcement which functions to maintain the 
intended cross-sectional shape of the hose and which is 

adhered to the surface of the rubber-coated fabric, 

characterized
 in that the helically-shaped reinforcement 
includes a plastic inner core having a predetermined, 

relatively high melting point, and at least one core 
external layer which is made of a similar plastic material 

to the core; in that the layer which lies nearest the core 
on the outer surface thereof is adhered to said surface; in 

that any further layers that may be included are adhered to 
one another in a similar manner; in that the outer layer is 

comprised of a plastic material whose melting point is 
lower or the same as the melting point of at least the 

nearest adjacent layer or of the core, whichever is 
applicable; and in that the contact region between the 

rubber-coated fabric and the plastic helix has an adhesion 
facilitating structure with intimate contact between the 

plastic helix and the rubber-coated fabric and a partially 
melted outer plastic layer. 
A hose according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
helically-shaped reinforcement has a generally round or 

crescent-like cross-sectional shape. 
A hose according to Claim 1 and 2, 
characterized
 in 
that the plastic material from which the helically-shaped 

reinforcement is made is comprised of different nylon 
qualities. 
A hose according to Claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in that 
the helically-shaped reinforcement is comprised of an inner 

nylon core whose melting point is higher than the temperature 
of a rubber vulcanizing process, and an external thin  

 
nylon layer whose melting point lies beneath said vulcanization 

temperature. 
A method for producing a hose comprising an inner 
rubber-coated fabric and an outer helically-shaped reinforcement 

which functions to maintain the intended cross-sectional 
shape of the hose and which adheres to the 

rubber-coated fabric, by helically winding 
rubber-coated fabric onto a mandrel in a known manner, with 

the turns of the helix partially overlapping one another; 
helically winding around the fabric helix at a predetermined 

pitch a rod which has been produced by extrusion 
followed by mechanical stretching and comprising at least 

two different plastic materials and including an inner core 
and at least one thin layer surrounding said core, of which 

at least the outer layer is comprised of a material whose 
melting point is not higher than the melting point of 

adjacent material; heating the mandrel and the helically 
wound rubber-coated fabric and plastic helix carried 

thereby to a temperature at which the rubber is vulcanized 
in the fabric coating and the plastic in the outer helix 

layer begins to melt, such that the plastic helix will 
shrink in conjunction with the vulcanizing process and the 

initial melting of the outer plastic layer and therewith 
provide intimate contact and adhesion between plastic helix 

and the rubber-coated fabric; and removing the thus formed 
hose from the mandrel. 
The use of the hose according to Claims 1-4 as a motor 
vehicle exhaust hose.
