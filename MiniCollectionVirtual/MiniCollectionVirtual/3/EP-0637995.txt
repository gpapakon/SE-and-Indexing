<ABSTRACT>
Catalysts which allow volatile sulphur compounds to be removed from industrial gases have an inorganic, abrasion-resistant, non-combustible support uniformly impregnated with oxides/hydroxides of the elements from the group consisting of niobium and tantalum, possibly with oxides/hydroxides of the elements of the second main group of the periodic table or with oxides/hydroxides of manganese, with at least one oxide/hydroxide of the elements from the group consisting of hafnium, lanthanium and the lanthanides, possibly with oxides/hydroxides of the elements from the group consisting of tungsten and molybdenum.

<CLAIMS>
Use of catalysts for the removal of volatile sulphur 
compounds of the group carbon oxysulphide, carbon 

disulphide, hydrogen sulphide and organic sulphur 
compounds from industrial gases, characterised in that 

the catalysts consist of an inorganic, 
abrasion-resistant, incombustible support which is 

uniformly impregnated with oxides/hydroxides of 
elements from the niobium and tantalum group and 

optionally with oxides/hydroxides of elements of main 
group 2 of the periodic system or with 

oxides/hydroxides of manganese and with at least one 
oxide/hydroxide of the elements from the hafnium, 

lanthanum and lanthanides group and optionally with 
oxides/hydroxides of elements from the tungsten and 

molybdenum group. 
Use of the catalysts according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the organic sulphur compounds 

removed from industrial gases are mercaptans. 
Use of the catalysts according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the industrial gases to be 

purified are 

a) laden with steam and then 
b) passed over the catalyst at temperatures of 
between 20 and 185째C, preferably 20 and 180째C and 
c) any hydrogen sulphide formed in b), together with 
that already present in the gas, is then removed. 
Use of the catalysts according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the hydrogen sulphide is removed 

in c) by passing the gases from b) together with air  
 

and/or oxygen over the catalyst at temperatures of 15 
to 180째C, preferably of 20 to 80째C, and regenerating 

the catalyst, preferably with steam, in order to 
remove the sulphur formed in c) from the catalyst. 
Catalysts for the removal of volatile sulphur 
compounds of the group carbon oxysulphide, carbon 

disulphide, hydrogen sulphide and organic sulphur 
compounds from industrial gases, characterised in that 

the catalysts consist of an inorganic, 
abrasion-resistant, incombustible support which is 

uniformly impregnated with oxides/hydroxides of 
manganese and with at least one oxide/hydroxide of the 

elements from the hafnium, lanthanum and lanthanides 
group and optionally with oxides/hydroxides of 

elements from the tungsten and molybdenum group.
