<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a flexible polyurethane foam comprises 
the step of using a polyether polyol which contains 50 weight % to less 

than 100 weight % of a single diol in the polyol component or 50 weight % 
or more of a plurality of single diols in the polyol component, a 

polyisocyanate, a catalyst and a blowing agent. Flexible polyurethane 
foam having excellent air permeability can be produced conveniently and 

economically according to the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a flexible polyurethane foam, more particularly, 
to a process for producing a flexible polyurethane foam 
having high air permeability used in applications requiring 
high air permeability, such as various kinds of filter, 
various kinds of roller for office automation instruments, 
cleaners, ear pads for headphones, cosmetic pads, masks, 
media for waste disposal, ceramics having three dimensional 
network structures or intermediate materials for metallic 
structures. In general processes for producing a flexible 
polyurethane foams, a trifunctional polyol is used as a 
polyol component. Flexible polyurethane foam is made into a 
three dimensionally crosslinked resin (cured foam) by 
competitive reactions between the resin forming reaction and 
the blowing reaction. Cell membranes are broken during the 
reactions making the foam into the three dimensionally 
crosslinked resin (the curing reaction) to form an open cell  
 
structure and a good foam is obtained without causing the 
contraction phenomenon. However, a considerable part of the 
cell membrane is generally left unbroken. Therefore, 
various methods have been developed for producing flexible 
polyurethane foam which has excellent air permeability and 
in which no cell membranes remain. The following are generally known examples of such 
methods. 
(1) A method of treating flexible polyurethane foam 
with heat, alkali or the like after it is prepared (Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 1966-752, British Patent No. 918495, 
Canadian Patent No. 620248). (2) A method of mixing a small amount of silica sol 
in the polyol component (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No. 1985-163912). (3) A method of adding small amounts of a 
hydrophilic organosilicon emulsifying surfactant and a 
hydrophobic antifoaming organosilicon compound (Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 1972-32095). (4) A method of using a polyester polyol having 
hydroxyl value of 40 to 70 as polyol and poly(oxypropylene-oxyethylene) 
ether polyol containing 50 weight % or more of 
the ethylene oxide component in an amount in the range of 20 
to 40 weight parts per 100 weight parts of said polyester 
polyol (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 1980-27315  
 
and 1980-27316). However, the method (1) has drawbacks in that, 
because a foam must be treated after it is prepared, the 
process is complicated and additional costs are required and 
in that the resin tends to be fractured after the treatment 
to cause a
