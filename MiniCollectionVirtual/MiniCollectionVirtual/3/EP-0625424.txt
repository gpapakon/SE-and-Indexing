<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet unit (iju) includes an ink jet head for 
ejecting ink; an ink cartridge (6000) for containing ink (6009) to 

be supplied to the ink jet head; an ink supply member (2200) 
for introducing the ink (6009) from the ink cartridge (6000), 

provided in the ink jet head; a negative pressure 
generating material (6003) in the ink cartridge (6000); an opening (6002) 

for permitting contact between the negative pressure 
generating material (6003) and in the ink supply member (2200); 

wherein a gap is formed in the opening (6002) when the ink 
supply member (2200) is in contact with the negative 

pressure generating material (6003).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet unit according to
the preamble of claim 1. It is usable
with recording apparatus or communication apparatus
such as a copying machine or a facsimile machine, or
with a textile printing apparatus for printing image
or the like on textile.An ink jet recording apparatus is now widely
used as a means for effect recording on a recording
material such as paper, textile or the like in a
printer, facsimile machine, a copying machine or the
like. In an ink jet recording apparatus, ink is
ejected from a recording head to a recording material
faced thereto. In one example, it is independently
installed in a casing as an ink jet recording
apparatus, and in another example it is built in, as
an integral part, in various electronic machines such
as a word processor, a personal computer or the like.
As regards the structure of an ink accommodating
portion used is such an ink jet recording apparatus,
it is required that the amount of the ink
corresponding to the amount of the ink ejected for the 
recording, can be properly supplied and that the ink
does not leak through the ejection outlet when the
recording operation is not carried out. Usually, the
ink accommodating portion is in the form of a
cartridge which is exchangeable. In one example, the
ink accommodating portion is made integral with an ink
jet head. When the situation that the ink in the ink
container can not be ejected from the ink jet
recording head, is reached, the ink accommodating
portion is disposed of with the recording head.
However, in the ink accommodating portion, some ink
still remains. The quantity of the non-usable
remaining ink is determined by an ink retaining power
of sponge (negative pressure generating material)
occupying the entirety of the inside space of the ink
accommodating portion, with the result that the
quantity is relatively large. In addition, the
recording head has to be exchanged with the ink
accommodating portion although the performance of the
recording head itself is still enough for the
operation. This results in cost increase and low
cost-performance. Under the circumstances, a proposal
has been made that the recording head and ink
cartridge are detachably mountable to permit exchange
of the ink cartridge alone. In this case, it is
further required that the mounting and demounting
between the recording head and the ink cartridge can 
be smoothly carried out without ink leakage and that
the ink can be assuredly supplied when they are
coupled together.JP-A-63 87242 discloses an
