<ABSTRACT>
A wafer mapping system uses a camera to acquire an image of a carrier containing wafers. In one embodiment, the acquired image is stored as rows and columns of pixels. The presence and location of a wafer in the carrier are determined by looking for pixel intensity variations in a column of the image.

<DESCRIPTION>
 WAFER MAPPING APPARATUS AND METHODBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention generally relates to semiconductor manufacturing equipment and more particularly to systems and methods for mapping semiconductor wafers.Description of the Related ArtA semiconductor manufacturing equipment is used to process semiconductor wafers into electronic devices. Typically, in this equipment, the wafers are contained in a carrier. While in the carrier, the wafers are "mapped" to determine the number of wafers to be processed and the slot location of each wafer in the carrier. Wafer mapping enables the manufacturing equipment to return a processed wafer to the original slot location from which the wafer came. Returning the wafer into its original slot location in the carrier is important because equipment operators rely on slot locations to distinguish the wafers. Knowing the number of wafers contained in the carrier is also important because the manufacturing equipment needs to know when all the wafers in the carrier have been processed to alert an equipment operator or to move the carrier out of a load lock.Wafer mapping has been performed using laser beams. Typically, the carrier is slowly moved in a vertical direction to cross the path of a horizontally aimed laser beam. A computer keeps track of when and how many times the wafers break the beam. By knowing the distance between the slots of the carrier, the computer can determine the number of wafers and the location of each wafer in the carrier. Because each wafer in the carrier is moved to break the beam, using a laser beam to perform wafer mapping takes time. Further, detecting a cross-slotted wafer (i.e. a single wafer which occupies two slots) is difficult using a laser beam because of the limited area which a beam can cover. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides a method and associated apparatus for mapping semiconductor wafers and wafer-like objects contained in a carrier or container. In one embodiment, an image of a carrier containing a wafer is acquired using, for example, a video camera. The image is digitized and stored in a computer as an array (i.e. row and column) of pixels, each pixel representing a point on the image. The intensity values of all pixels in a column of the image is then extracted. Because the presence of a wafer against a contrasting background generates an intensity variation in the pixels of the acquired image, the presence of the wafer can be determined by looking for variations in
