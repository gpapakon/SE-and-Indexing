<ABSTRACT>
A memory integrated circuit comprises an array of 
memory cells each including a latch circuit and a pair of P-channel 

access transistors. A word line for each row of 
memory cells is driven by a word driver circuit including an 

emitter follower at the output stage thereof. The word line 
is selected by a low-state thereof to turn on the P-channel 

access transistor, whereby the maximum gate-source voltage 
of the P-channel access transistor is as high as the supply 

voltage irrespective of the potential of signal node of the 
latch circuit. Hence, a higher-speed operation of the 

memory integrated circuit can be obtained. Moreover, since 
a word line is selected by a low-state thereof, current 

flowing in unselected NTL word driver circuits can be 
reduced. Furthermore, since cutoff is not effected until 

the potential of signal node becomes equal to the potential 
of the high-potential voltage source, writing operation can 

be effected at a high speed so that probability of an Î±-ray 
error can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory 
integrated circuit and, more particularly, to an improvement 
in an access transistor of a memory cell and a word driver 
circuit thereof. Semiconductor memory integrated circuits generally 
include an array of memory cells, each of which comprises a 
latch circuit implemented by a pair of inverters each 
comprising either a resistor and a MOS transistor connected 
in series or a P-channel and an N-channel MOS transistors 
connected in series, and a pair of N-channel MOS transistors 
called access transistors. Outside the memory cells, there 
are provided, for selecting a memory cell, a word line for 
each row of the memory cells and a pair of bit lines for 
each column of the memory cells. Each of the access 
transistors is connected between corresponding one of pair 
of signal nodes of the latch circuits and corresponding one 
of bit lines for reading and writing data from and to the  
 
memory cell. The word line is connected to the gate 
electrodes of the access transistors. In a conventional memory integrated circuit, there is a 
request for lowering a supply voltage without a malfunction 
thereof as well as for a higher speed in operation of a 
memory cell. There is also a request for lowering a power 
consumption in a conventional memory integrated circuit In view of the foregoing, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a semiconductor memory integrated 
circuit in which writing speed for a memory cell can be 
improved, in which lower supply voltage can be employed 
without a malfunction or in which power consumption can be 
lowered, for a specified combination of a memory cell and a 
word driver circuit. A semiconductor memory integrated circuit according to 
a first aspect of the present invention comprises a 
substrate, an array of memory cells arranged in rows and 
columns on the substrate, a word line disposed for each row 
of the memory cells, a pair of bit lines disposed for each 
column of the memory cells, and a word driver circuit 
disposed for each word line and having an emitter follower 
for driving corresponding word line, each of the memory 
cells including a pair of P-channel access transistors and a  
 
latch circuit having a pair of signal nodes electrically 
interposed between a first voltage source and a second 
voltage source, each of said P-channel access transistors 
being responsive to a low-state of corresponding word line 
for connecting corresponding one of the signal nodes to
