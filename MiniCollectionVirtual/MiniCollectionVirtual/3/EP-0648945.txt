<ABSTRACT>
Screw-in fastening device comprising a female component (1) equipped with a blind hole (3) exhibiting trapped threads (6) and a male component (2) exhibiting external screw threads (9). A protuberance (17) projects from the bottom of the blind hole (3) and the male component includes a longitudinal slot (10), which means that the male component can be inserted into part of the female component without rotating the male component and then, when the distal end (11) of the male component comes into contact with the free end (18) of the protuberance (17), this contact causes those parts of the male component which are separated by the slot (10) to move apart, following which rotational actuation of the male component (2) over a small number of turns brings about immobilisation.

<CLAIMS>
A fixing device by screwing comprising a female part (1) provided with a blind hole

(3) presenting tapped threads (6) and a male part (2) presenting extemal screw cut
threads (9) and comprising a longitudinal slot (10) opening out at the level of its

distal end (11), characterized in that :

a protuberance (17) protrudes out from the bottom of the blind hole (3) of the
female part longitudinally in the direction of the male part ; and
the longitudinal slot (10) bounds parts designed to flex elastically, transversely
from one another, so that, in a first stage, the male part can be inserted in a part of

the female part without tuming the male part, due to the fact that the parts of the
male part separated by the slot (1) can move elastically towards one another and

make the extemal screw cut threads (9) not screw with the tapped threads (6), and
that when the distal end (11) of the male part comes into contact with the free end

(18) of the protuberance (17), this contact causes separation of the parts of the male
part separated by the slot (10) and engagement of the extemal screw cut threads

with the tapped threads, then in a second stage, the male part (2) can be actuated in
rotation a small number of tums causing the male part to be screwed into the female

part until the blocked position is reached.
The fixing device by screwing according to claim 1, characterized in that the free
end (18) of the protuberance is pointed, tapered or rounded to facilitate insertion of

the protuberance (17) into the slot (10) while causing separation of the parts of the
male part separated by the slot.
The fixing device by screwing according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
male part (2) comprises two diametrically opposed flats (12, 13) arranged

longitudinally at the level of the threaded part (8) where the slot (10) opens out.
The fixing device by screwing according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that
the male part (2) and female part (1) are made of plastic.
The fixing device by screwing according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterized in that
the threads (6, 9) of the male part (2) and female part (1) present dissymmetrical

flanks.
