<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for a statistics Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
(108) wherein the statistics CRC (108) is representative of the values contained within a

statistics RAM (110). The statistics CRC (108) is then used to reduce test vectors by
allowing the validity of the statistics to be determined by reading this signature instead of

reading all the individual statistics. The signature is regenerated for each complete pass
of the statistics, and the contents of this register are only updated when the pass is

complete.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to statistical analysis and more particularly to
improved methods of storing and analyzing statistics.The generation and analysis of statistics is useful to track and test the performance
of many processes. In certain systems, however, the amount of statistics needed becomes
cumbersome in that the amount of time it takes to manipulate the data and the amount of
memory needed to store the data increases. One particular application where this is true is
in the generation, storage and manipulation of network statistics.Thus, there is a need for a method and system of managing large amounts of
statistical data. The present invention provides for a statistics Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
wherein the statistics CRC is representative of the values contained within the statistics
RAM. The statistics CRC is then used to reduce test vectors by allowing the validity of
the statistics to be determined by reading this signature instead of reading all the
individual statistics. The signature is regenerated for each complete pass of the statistics,
and the contents of this register are only updated when the pass is complete.These and other features of the invention that will be apparent to those skilled in the
art from the following detailed description of the invention, taken together with the
accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a system for statistics CRC signature generation in
accordance with the present invention; andFig. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating use of the CRC signature generated in
accordance with the present invention.The present invention provides for a statistics Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
wherein the statistics CRC is representative of the values contained within the statistics
RAM. The statistics CRC is then used to reduce test vectors by allowing the validity of
the statistics to be determined by reading this signature instead of reading all the
individual statistics. The signature is regenerated for each complete pass of the statistics,
and the contents of this register are only updated when the pass is complete. This
statistics CRC is thus a signature which can be used to represent the data from which it
was generated.One embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1. Each time a 64-bit
statistic 102 is modified and written back to the Statistics RAM 110 16 bits, i.e., bytes 0
and 2, of the 64-bit statistic 102 are exclusived or'd together in XOR 104. The 8-bit
result is fed into one input of the CRC generator 106. While bytes 0 and 2
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of verifying statistical data comprising the steps of:
generating a first CRC signature associated with the statistical data;

when the statistical data is regenerated:

regenerating said CRC signature
if said regenerated CRC signature is the same as the first CRC signature
then generating a signal to indicate verification of the statistical data; and
if said regenerated CRC signature is not the same as the first CRC signature
then generating a signal to indicate an error in the statistical data.
