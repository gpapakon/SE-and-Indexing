<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a bovine 
group I phospholipase A₂ receptor comprising an amino 

acid sequence from Leu in the 486 position to Pro in 
the 940 position of SEQ ID No. 1, and a gene encoding 

the bovine group I phospholipase A₂ receptor. It was 
found that the bovine group I phospholipase A₂ receptor 

has multi-domain structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bovine 
group I phospholipase A₂ receptor; a structural gene of 
a bovine group I phospholipase A₂ receptor; a bovine 
group I phospholipase A₂ receptor encoded by the structural 
gene; an expression vector having the structural 
gene; a transformant having the expression vector; and 
a method for producing a bovine group I phospholipase 
A₂ receptor using the transformant. Phospholipase A₂ (hereinafter referred to as 
PLA₂; EC 3.1.1.4) is a lipolytic enzyme for hydrolyzing 
a 2-acyl ester bond in 3-sn-phosphoglyceride and is 
known to be present in mammal pancreas, snake venom and 
the like. PLA₂ which is known in the art can be classified 
into a high molecular weight intercellular type 
and a low molecular weight secretion type. The low 
molecular weight secretion type PLA₂ are further classified 
into two groups: PLA₂-I and PLA₂-II. PLA₂-I is 
present in mammal pancreas and the like. PLA₂-I in the 
pancreas is one of the digestive enzymes secreted into 
pancreatic juice, and is generally present as a zymogen 
and transformed into the active form by being hydrolyzed 
with a proteolytic enzyme such as trypsin. 
PLA₂-II is present in a large amount in platelets and 
the like, and is regarded to be mainly related to 
inflammation mechanisms. Recently it was found that PLA₂-I also exists 
in the lung, stomach, spleen and kidney (Sakata et al.,  
 
Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1007, 124-126 (1989); Seilhamer 
et al., DNA, 5, 519-527 (1986); Yasuda et al., Biochim. 
Biophys. Acta, 1046, 189-194 (1990); and Tojo et al., 
J. Biol. Chem., 263, 5724-5731 (1988)). Further, it 
has been suggested that PLA₂-I possibly has another 
function other than as a digestive enzyme (Kanemasa et 
al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1125, 210-214 (1992)). It 
has also been reported that PLA₂-I exhibits, through a 
PLA₂-I receptor, a function in the growth of cells 
(Arita et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266, 19139-19141 (1991)) 
and in contraction of lung parenchyma (Kanemasa et al., 
FEBS LETTERS, 303, 217-220 (1992)). A protein which binds to PLA₂-I (i.e., a 
PLA₂-I receptor) was recently identified. This protein 
was purified from a membrane fraction of a bovine 
corpus luteum and comprises one glycoprotein having a 
molecular weight of 190,000 (Hanasaki and Arita, 
Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1127, 233-241 (1992)). The bovine group I phospholipase A₂ receptor 
of this invention comprises an amino acid sequence from 
Leu in the 486 position to Pro in the 940 position of 
SEQ ID No. 1. In one embodiment, the
