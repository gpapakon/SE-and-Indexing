<ABSTRACT>
The belt retractor for restraint systems in vehicles is equipped with an innovative housing structure. The load bearing part of the housing is composed of a casing section (10) which surrounds the locking toothings (26a, 28a) on the circumferences of the flanges of the belt wheel (18) and the end pieces of which are situated one on top of the other, are fastened to one another and form a fastening plate. Essentially only tensile forces occur in the casing section (10) when a heavy load is exerted. The casing section (10) which surrounds the locking toothings (26a, 28a) in this process acts as a belt brake, as a result of which the catches (22, 24) are released.

A belt retractor for vehicular seat belt restraint
systems, having a housing to be secured to the body of the

vehicle by means of a securing plate (10c, 10d), a belt reel
(18) being rotatably mounted in said housing and the flanges

(18a, 18b) of said belt reel being each provided with a
locking toothing (26a, 28a), and at least one band-shaped

shell section (10) of said housing, wherein said band-shaped
shell section (10) surrounds said locking toothings (26a,

28a) provided on the outer circumference of said flanges
(18a, 18b), characterized in that


said band-shaped shell section (10) is connected to said
securing plate (10c, 10d) and
forms a closed loop with said securing plate (10c, 10d),
and
the bearings of said belt reel (18) yield under load, thus
permitting that the flanges (18a, 18b) thereof abut against

said band-shaped shell section (10) of said housing.
The belt retractor according to claim 1, characterized
in that said band-shaped shell section (10) has two strips

(10c, 10f) spaced away from each other in the axial direction
of the belt reel (18), the ends of said strips being

connected to said securing plate (10c, 10d). 
The belt retractor according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the band-shaped shell section (10) is

fabricated from a single piece of flat material, stamped and
bent accordingly, the ends (10e, 10d) of which are placed

one on the other and secured together to form the securing
plate.
The belt retractor according to claims 2 and 3, characterized
in that the strips (10e, 10f) merge at each of their

ends into a flat end-piece (10c, 10d) taking up the axial
width of said shell section.
The belt retractor according to any one of claims 2 to
4, characterized in that the strips (10e, 10f) are connected

to each other by a web (10g) in the axial direction of the
belt reel (18) in their region more or less diametrically

opposed to said securing plate (10c, 10d).
The belt retractor according to claim 5, characterized
in that the web (10g) has a channel-shaped section.
The belt retractor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the axial ends of the shell

section (10) are each terminated by a fitted cap (12, 14).
The belt retractor according to claim 7, characterized
in that each cap (12, 14) has one of the two bearings of the

belt reel (18).
The belt retractor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the shell section (10) surrounds

a generally cylindrical interior space of the housing,
said interior space accommodating the belt reel (18)

and being extended in the region of the securing plate (10c,
10d) by a generally prism-shaped space in which two locking

pawls (22, 24) interacting with the locking toothings (26a,
28a) of the flanges (18a, 18b) are swivably mounted. 
The belt retractor according to claim 9, characterized
in that the locking pawls (22, 24) are rigidly connected

to each other by an axial web (20).
The belt retractor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least one of the locking

toothings (26a, 28a) is formed on the outer circumference of
a ring (26, 28) applied to the outside of the corresponding

flange (18a, 18b) and that said ring (26, 28) surrounds a
cylindrical space in which the functional parts (30; 30, 36)

of the belt retractor are accommodated.
The belt retractor according to claim 11, characterized
in that a vehicle-sensitive actuator mechanism (38, 42) is

arranged in a recess of one of the locking pawls (22), said
mechanism having a swivable control pawl (38), the free end

of which protrudes through a window (22a) of the locking
pawl (22) and is movably engageable with the locking toothing

(28a) opposite the circumference of which said window
(22a) is located.
The belt retractor according to claim 12, characterized
in that on engagement of the control pawl (38) with one of

the locking toothings (28a) the locking pawls (22, 24) are
swivelled into engagement with the locking toothings (26a,

28a) by rotation of the belt reel (18) which is transmitted
to the locking pawls (22, 24) by means of the control pawl

(38) supported between the one locking toothing (28a) and
the corresponding locking pawl (22).
The belt retractor according to claim 13, characterized
in that the control pawl (38) is coupled to a coupling gearwheel

(36) by a driving member (40) connected in the axial
direction of the belt reel (18), said coupling gearwheel

(36) having limited freedom of rotation and being in turn
adapted to be drivingly coupled to the belt reel (18) by a

webbing-sensitive actuator mechanism (32, 34). 
The belt retractor according to claim 14, characterized
in that said driving member is constituted by
 a pin (40)
engaging a slot (36b) in a projection (36a) on the circumference

of said coupling gearwheel (36).
