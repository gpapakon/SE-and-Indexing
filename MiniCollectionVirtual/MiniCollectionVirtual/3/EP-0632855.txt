<ABSTRACT>
A bobbin basket for use with a rotary loop-taker in a lock-stitch sewing machine. The basket is integrally formed of plastic, with damage resistant members for reducing wear and impact damage at specified locations. The extent of each such location may be only a small fraction of the potential area of wear or damage. Inserts are disclosed for the needle thread stop (40), the needle thread pick-up notch (42), the upstream (in relation to the direction of rotation of the loop taker) sidewall (30b) of the rotation-restraining notch (32), the bearing rib (34), and the downstream sidewall (30a) of the rotation-restraining notch (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bobbin basket for
a lock-stitch sewing machine, and more particularly to a
plastic bobbin basket that includes members to resist
damage to the bobbin basket that might otherwise occur
when the basket is used in the sewing machine.This invention complements the invention
described and claimed in applicant's U. S. patent
No. 4,858,543 issued August 22, 1989 and assigned to the
assignee of the present invention. The bobbin basket
covered by that patent is adapted for use with a
horizontal rotary loop taker, which is the term used in
the sewing machine industry for rotary loop takers or
"hooks" that when installed in a lock-stitch sewing
machine have a horizontal axis of rotation. The present
invention is useful for any bobbin basket, whether it is
adapted for use with a horizontal hook or with a vertical
hook.Prior to the invention disclosed and claimed in
patent No. 4,858,543, bobbin baskets used in the
industrial sewing machine industry were customarily made
of metal, typically steel. Steel bobbin baskets have a
number of disadvantages that have been recognized for a
very long time. The invention covered by patent No.
4,858,543 took a big step toward providing a bobbin
basket that avoids the problems associated with steel
bobbin baskets, by providing a plastic bobbin basket of
greatly increased usefulness and much longer life than
was previously believed to be possible. The present
invention goes still farther in increasing the usefulness
of a plastic bobbin basket and extending its life.The many advantages that a bobbin basket formed
almost entirely of plastic has over a conventional all 
steel basket are clear. Molding of the basic plastic
piece (with or without the small inserts of the present
invention which are described below) is far more
convenient and less expensive than the casting or forging
-- followed by various machining, polishing and hardening
steps -- that is involved in the production of an all
steel bobbin basket. Chattering of the bearing rib in
its raceway -- which produces chipping and burring, with
resulting thread breakage -- is avoided with such a
plastic bobbin basket. The lower coefficient of friction
between the bearing rib and its raceway produces a longer
life for the plastic bobbin basket, and avoids the
problems of messy lubrication, galling, bluing of the
rotary loop taker, and puckering of the goods being sewn
that accompany the use of an all steel basket.As already mentioned above, U. S. patent No.

A bobbin basket 20 for use with a rotary
loop taker in a lock-stitch sewing machine, which

comprises:

a cylindrical side wall 22, a crosswise support
member 24 for the cylindrical side wall 22 extending

across the bottom of the bobbin basket, a bobbin
spool support post 26 extending axially from said

crosswise support member 24 into the space defined by
said cylindrical side wall 22,
a flange 28 extending radially outward from the
top portion of said cylindrical side wall, two

portions 28a, 28b of said flange forming first and
second oppositely facing side walls 30a, 30b that are

positioned generally radially to form a rotation-restraining
notch 32 in the top surface of the flange

28, said first notch side wall 30a forming the
downstream side of the rotation-restraining notch 32

relative to the direction of rotation of the rotary
loop taker with which the bobbin basket is adapted to

be used, said second notch side wall 30b forming the
upstream side of said rotation-restraining notch 32

relative to said direction of rotation, said notch 32
being adapted to receive the stud portion of a

stationary positioning finger with a secure but
sufficiently loose fit to permit limited back and

forth rotational movement of the bobbin basket 20, 
and
an annular bearing rib 34 extending radially
outward from said cylindrical side wall 22, said rib

34 being located between the aforesaid outwardly
extending flange 28 and the bottom of the bobbin

basket 20 and extending substantially around the
perimeter of the bobbin basket 20 except for a minor

portion of said annular rib 34 that is omitted to
provide two oppositely facing rib end portions 38, 40

that define a needle thread pick-up and release area,
the first of said oppositely facing rib end
portions 38 forming a pick-up notch 42 at the

downstream end, relative to the aforesaid direction
of rotation of the rotary loop taker with which the

bobbin basket is adapted to be used, of the needle
thread pick-up and release area, and
the second of said oppositely facing rib end
portions 40 being located adjacent said rotation-restraining

notch 32 to form a needle thread stop 44
at the upstream end, relative to said direction of

rotation, of the needle thread pick-up and release
area, and

   characterised in that:

(a) the bobbin basket 20, including said
cylindrical side wall 22, said outwardly extending

flange 28 and said outwardly extending bearing rib
34, is integrally formed of plastic, and 
(b) said bearing rib 34 includes means 44 for
reducing wear on said second, upstream rib end

portion that forms the aforesaid needle thread stop,
as the needle thread loop comes into contact with

said stop, the thread is pulled forcefully across the
stop to tighten the loop around the bobbin thread,
(c) said bearing rib 34 includes means for
reducing wear on said first, downstream rib end

portion that forms the aforesaid pick-up notch, as
the needle thread loop is caught in said notch and

moves axially across the notch as the rotary loop
taker rotates and enlarges the loop,
(d) said second, upstream side wall 30b of the
rotation-restraining notch 32 includes means 70 for

minimising impact damage to said second side wall 30b
caused by the aforesaid stud portion of the

stationary positioning finger as the bobbin basket 20
is jerked back and forth by the needle thread loop to

cause said second side wall 30b to strike said stud
repeatedly as tension is applied to the thread of the

needle thread loop first in one direction and then in
the other,
(e) said bearing rib 34 includes means for
reducing wear on the rib body caused by the rotary

loop taker raceway in which the rib is journaled,
while at the same time substantial contact is

maintained between the raceway and the rib body
including said wear-reducing means, and 
(f) the area occupied by each of said means for
reducing wear or minimising impact damage at a given

location on the bobbin basket falls in the range from
a small fraction of the potential area of wear or

impact damage at that given location to the entire
area of potential wear or damage at that location.
