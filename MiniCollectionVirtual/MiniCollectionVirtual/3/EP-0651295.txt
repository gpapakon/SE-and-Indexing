<ABSTRACT>
A color copy of high-definition and high quality can be easily and stably obtained without any color 
misregistration, and also, a color image with stable preservability can be formed. On the surface of an 

electrophotographic photosensitive element, a compound (S) containing fluorine atoms and/or silicon atoms is provided 
in order to form a peelable transfer layer on the surface of the photosensitive element. A toner image of one or more 

colors is formed on the transfer layer by an electrophotographic process. Then the toner image is transferred to a 
transfer material together with the transfer layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
forming an electrophotographic color transfer image and
an apparatus used therefor, and more particularly to a
method of forming an electrophotographic color transfer
image which forms color images free from color shear, by
which toner images are completely transferred onto a
receiving material without being accompanied by degradation
of image quality upon the transfer and which
provides color duplicates having good storage stability,
and an apparatus used therefor.Methods of forming color printings, color
duplicates or color proofs (proofs for printing) which
comprise providing a plurality of overlapping color
toner images directly on the surface of electrophotographic
photographic light-sensitive element using an
development process and transferring at
once the resulting color images onto a receiving
material such as printing paper are known.The developing methods include a so-called dry
type developing method and wet type developing method. 
Color images obtained by the wet type developing method
are preferred because of little color shear and good
resolution as compared with those formed with dry
toners. However, it is very difficult to directly
transfer wet type toner images entirely from the surface
of the light-sensitive element to a receiving material
such as printing paper.In order to solve this problem, a transfer
technique in which a non-aqueous solvent is supplied
between a light-sensitive element and a receiving
material and then transfer is electrostatically
performed is described in JP-A-2-272469 (the term "JP-A"
as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese
patent application").Also, a method in which a transparent film is
first laminated on the surface of a light-sensitive
element, wet type toner images are formed by an electrophotographic
process on the film, and then the film
bearing the toner images is separated from the light-sensitive
element and stuck on paper, thereby forming
transferred images is described in JP-A-2-115865 and JP-A-2-115866.
According to the method, the film to be
laminated has suitably a thickness of 9 µm. However,
the production and handling of a film having such 
thickness is very troublesome and it is necessary to
arrange a special system for them.Further, in JP-B-2-43185 (the term "JP-B" as
used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication"),
a method in which imagewise exposure through a
transparent electrophotographic light-sensitive element
and development are conducted repeatedly to form
