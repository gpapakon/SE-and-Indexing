<ABSTRACT>
This arrangement is of the type comprising a light-conducting cable made in the form of an optical fibre (2) formed by a multitude of elementary fibres, a device for holding and fastening the optical fibre on a support structure and means for directing the light beam leaving the fibre. The arrangement is characterised in that the said fastening device is a device (5) for holding the optical fibre (1, 2) in a fixed position and the device (9) for directing the light beam (8a) emitted by the fibre (2) comprises at least one member (10) for deflecting the beam, which is mounted so that it can be rotated about the axis of the optical fibre (2) on a fixed support. The invention is usable for illumination sources with a directable light beam.

Lighting source arrangement of the type comprising a 
light conducting cable made as an optical fiber formed of 

a multitude of elementary fibers, variable means for the 
orientation of the light beam exiting from the fiber,. 

comprising a beam deviation member located at the outlet 
of the optical fiber and mounted for rotation about the 

axis of the fiber, a device for retaining and fastening 
the optical fiber onto a supporting structure, 

characterized in that the said fastening device is a 
device (5) for holding the optical fiber (1, 2) in a 

stationary position, in that it comprises a second 
variable member (27) for the deviation of the light beam, 

mounted for translatory motion along the axis of the beam 
(8b) deviated by the first deviation member (10) and an 

optical device associated with the deviation members (10, 
27) so as to permit, together with the axial displacement 

of the second deviation member (27), a variation of the 
angle of divergence of the outcoming beam (8c). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the first deviation member (10) is mounted in a 

casing (22) provided with a tubular nipple (15) for the 
conduction of the light from the optical fiber to the 

first deviation member (10) and for positioning the 
casing on the end of the optical fiber and in that the 

second deviation member (27) is rotatably mounted onto 
the casing (22), both deviation members (10, 27) being 

disposed within the casing so that they may carry out a 
relative movement along the axis of the beam deviated by 

the first member (10). 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a deviation member (10, 27) is a 

member comprising a surface for the total reflection of  
 

the beam, which is inclined with respect to the latter 
and the angle of inclination of which is variable. 
Arrangement according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the first deviation member (10) is mounted in a 

supporting body comprising the aforesaid nipple (15), 
this body being disposed inside of the casing (22) 

provided with an axial slot (23) for the passage of the 
nipple (15) so that the casing be axially displaceable 

with respect to the body carrying the deviation member 
(10). 
Arrangement according to claims 2 and 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the tubular nipple (15) is mounted 

onto the device (5) for holding the cable (1) in a fixed 
position coaxially to the optical fiber (2). 
Arrangement according to claim 4, characterized in 
that a deviation member (10, 27) is formed of a total-reflection 

prism. 
Arrangement acording to claim 5, characterized in that 
the prism (10, 27) exhibits a rectangular-isosceles shape 

and its hypotenuse surface constitutes the total-reflection 
surface.
