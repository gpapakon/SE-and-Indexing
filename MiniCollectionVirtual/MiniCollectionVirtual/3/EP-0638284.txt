<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming an image representing fat distribution in a tissue 
based on the fat constitution from the tomographic data. The method 

comprises: the steps (D1 and D7) of obtaining two tomographic data by 
scanning a subject and a phantom under different tube voltages, said phantom 

being charged with a standard fat substance in addition to a bone-salt 
equivalent, the steps (D2 and D8) of detecting the CT value of each pixel in 

the whole or target region of the tomographic data as αwf (CT value of tissue 
including fat), the steps (D3 and D9) of detecting the CT value of the 

bone-salt equivalent to calculate the regression line between the CT value 
and the density of the bone-salt equivalent, thus defining the CT value as 

αnf (CT value of tissue not including fat), the steps (D4 and D10) of detecting 
αff (CT value of standard fat substance), the steps (D5 and D11) of detecting 

the CT value of the blood part as αst (CT value of standard soft tissue 
substance), the steps (D6 and D12) of correlating each CT value with the 

formula 

αwt = αnf + β·{αff-αst} 
 
 (formula A), wherein β serves as a fat rate 

parameter, the step (D13) of calculating the β value of each pixel in the 
whole or target region of the tomographic data from the regression line and 

the formula A with attention paid to the fact that the density of the bone-salt 
equivalent remains constant even in the scanning under different tube voltages, 

and the step (D14) of forming the image based on the parameter β.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a CT system for
generating a fat distribution image. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a CT system for
generating a fat distribution image, wherein an image of
fat distribution is generated from a cross sectional
image data via X ray.Document US-A-4 922 915 discloses a CT system for
generating a cross sectional image data, with scanning
means for scanning a patient body with a phantom which
contains a sample rod of a fat standard material and
plural sample rods respectively having different
densities of a bone mineral equivalent material, by an X-ray
tube, CT number detecting means for detecting the CT
number of each pixel in the whole region or an objective
region of the cross sectional image of the patient body,
the CT number of the fat standard material and the CT
numbers of the plural sample rods of the phantom, and
calibration means for calculating a calibration factor 
based upon the known bone mineral densities and the CT
numbers of the sample rods.This system, however, does not provide the
generation of fat distribution images.As a method for generating a fat distribution image
from a cross sectional image data via X ray, a method is
known comprising determining a threshold value so as to
extract the CT number range from -130 to -100 from the
cross sectional image data, based on the finding that the
CT number of fat is about -130 to -100.However, because the fat composition ratio in human
bodies varies depending on the tissue, the conventional
method described above comprising determining a threshold
value has problems in that fat cannot be separated solely
from other components in tissues and in that the fat
composition ratio in ROI (region of interest) cannot be
determined.Thus, the object of the present invention resides in
providing a CT system for generating a fat distribution
image, wherein an image representing fat distribution is
generated, based on the fat composition ratio in a
tissue.This object is achieved with the features of the CT
systems of present claims 1 and 2. The method of
operation of these systems will be described as follows. In a first aspect of the method of operation of the system of the
present invention, the method for generating a fat distribution image by
the CT system wherein an image of fat distribution is generated
from a cross sectional image data via X ray comprises the
steps of a scanning step wherein scanning is effected at
least at two different levels of X-ray tube voltage using
a phantom containing a
