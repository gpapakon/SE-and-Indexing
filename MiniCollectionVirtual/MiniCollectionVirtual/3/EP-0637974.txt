<ABSTRACT>
A guide catheter (110) for use in treatment of the right main coronary artery of a cardiovascular system includes a hollow, flexible tubular body (112). The tubular body (112) has a proximal, generally straight portion (114) and a distal, generally curvaceous portion (116) having a distal end (143). The distal portion (116) of the tubular body (112) has a primary curve (140) proximal the distal end (143) and a secondary curve (146) proximal the primary curve (140). The primary and secondary curves (140, 146) are defined by preshaped, consecutively arranged obtuse angled segments of the tubular body (112). The distal portion (116) also has a tertiary curve (123) proximal the secondary curve (146), and the tertiary curve (123) is defined by a preshaped, oppositely disposed arched extent of the tubular body (112) long enough to cause the distal portion (116) to overlie itself in its preformed configuration prior to use. The curves (140, 146, 123) of the distal portion (116) are preformed and aligned so that in use, after the guide catheter (110) has been advanced through the descending aorta, over the aortic arch, and into the ascending aorta to a position where the distal end (143) is generally coaxially aligned within the ostium of the right main coronary artery, the distal portion (116) of the guide catheter (110) engages the wall of the ascending aorta and engages the wall of the aortic arch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to catheters
adapted to be inserted into the cardiovascular system of
a living body and, more particularly, to a preshaped
catheter having an improved distal end portion for
providing more precise access to the right main coronary
artery of the cardiovascular system. A guide catheter
according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-256478.Catheters are often used in the performance of
medical procedures such as coronary angiography for
injecting dye, or the like, into the cardiovascular
system for diagnosis; and angioplasty to widen the lumen
of a coronary artery which has become at least partially
blocked by a stenotic lesion causing an abnormal
narrowing of the artery due to injury or disease. In
these techniques the distal end of a therapeutic
catheter is introduced into the aorta by way of the
femoral artery. The proximal end of the catheter is
then manipulated so its distal end is inserted into the
lumen of a selected coronary artery branching off from
the aorta. A typical treatment procedure would involve
initially inserting a guiding catheter into the
cardiovascular system in the above manner, followed by
the introduction of a suitable therapeutic device, such
as a dilating catheter, a laser catheter, an atherectomy
catheter, or the like. The therapeutic catheter is
guided through the guiding catheter until its distal end
portion is positioned adjacent the stenotic lesion in
the coronary artery for use in reducing the blockage in
the artery. In all such medical procedures, it is
absolutely essential that the guiding catheter has the
appropriate shape for proper alignment of its distal end
relative to the coronary artery. The most common catheter used in treatment of
the right main coronary artery is what is often referred
to as a "Judkins" catheter, which has a specially shaped
distal end portion for facilitating insertion and
engagement into the right coronary artery. However,
there are some significant disadvantages to the
"Judkins" catheter, such as its frequent inability to
align perfectly coaxially with the selected artery and
thus permit optimal treatment, and its inability to
adequately support other therapeutic devices such as
balloon catheters. Also, the Judkins catheter requires
a 180 degree rotation and adroit manipulation to
selectively engage its distal end in the right main
coronary artery, which makes it more difficult to use
effectively and efficiently.In FIGS. 1A and 1B of the drawings, the
reference numerical 10 refers, in general, to a

A guide catheter for use in treatment of a selected human coronary artery, the
guide catheter comprising a hollow, flexible tubular body of a preformed shape

having:

a proximal, generally straight portion and a distal, generally curvaceous portion
with a distal end (142), the distal portion having a primary curve (140) proximal the distal

end, a secondary curve (146) proximal the primary curve (140), and a tertiary
curve (123) proximal to the secondary curve (146), wherein the curves being

formed and aligned so that after the guide catheter has been advanced through
the descending aorta, over the aortic arch, and into the ascending aorta (512) to a

position where the distal end (142) is generally coaxially aligned relative to the
ostium (520) of the selected coronary artery (518), the distal portion of the guide

catheter engages the wall of the ascending aorta (512) and engages the wall of
the aortic arch,
characterised in that

the curves further being formed and aligned so that the body of the guide
catheter, from the secondary curve (146) and extending proximally, engages the

postero-medial wall (516) of the ascending aorta (512) and wraps around the
floor (510) of the aortic arch (504), both in a substantially continuous manner.
The guide catheter of claim 1 wherein the primary and secondary curves
(140,146) are preformed to curve in a first arced direction and the tertiary curve

(123) is preformed to curve in a second, opposite arced direction.
The guide catheter of claim 1 wherein the body of the guide catheter first engages
the ascending aorta (512) proximally of the distal end at a point on the ascending

aorta generally opposite the ostium of the selected coronary artery. 
The guide catheter of claim 1 wherein the tertiary curve (123) of the distal portion of
the body of the guide catheter is overcurved.
The guide catheter of claim 1 wherein the tertiary curve (123) is long enough to
cause the distal portion of the body of the catheter to overlie itself in its preformed

configuration.
The guide catheter of claim 1 wherein the secondary curve (146) of the distal portion
contacts the wall of the ascending aorta (512) and the tertiary curve (123) of the

distal portion contacts the wall of the ascending aorta (512) and the wall of the aortic
arch (504).
