A process for the automatic manufacture 
of a textile backing with decorative effects, in 

which: 

a textile backing comprising weft yarns (1) 
and warp yarns (2) is made on an automatic loom, 
simultaneously with the formation of the 
backing, at least one decorative effect is formed and 

anchored on the textile backing by means of 
meshes (4) made simultaneously with the basic 

backing, 
the bonding needles (5) used in forming the 
locking mesh are raised across the warp yarn lap of 

the basic backing, 
the bonding needles (5) for forming the 
locking mesh are retracted under the basic textile 

backing (1) (2), 
the decorative weft (6) is inserted at right 
angles to the warp yarns (2) of the basic textile 

backing, 
the bonding needles (5) for forming the 
locking mesh are shifted and raised again, and 

simultaneously, the locking mesh yarn (4) is shifted 
according to a circle arc movement and using binding 

guides (23), so as to twill the path of said 
needles (5), thereby forming the decorative weft's 

locking mesh and flattening it against the 
needles (5),  

 
at the dead centre (O), the binding 
guides (23) for forming the locking mesh are 

displaced in translation at right angles to the warp, 
the needles (5) and the binding guides (23) 
for forming the locking mesh are simultaneously 

lowered, drawing the mesh-forming yarns (4) by 
creation of a loop of meshes enclosing the decorative 

weft (6), 
 
characterized in that 


the decorative weft or wefts (6) are held by 
the meshes (4) of the warp so as to define portions 

of the floating decorative weft parallel to the warp, 
thereby constituting loops of decorative weft which 

are variable in amplitude and length, in accordance 
with a predetermined programme. 
Device for carrying out the process as 
claimed in Claim 1, comprising 


means (16) (22) for distributing the 
decorative weft or wefts (6), 
means (24) (25) (26) for applying motion in 
an arc of a circle which crosses the path of the 

needles (5), to a support or supports (23) that 
receive the locking mesh yarn (4), 
 
characterized in that it includes: 


means (8) (10) (11) for moving the bonding 
needles (5) for forming the locking mesh in back-and-forth 

motion so as to subject them to vertical motion  
 

in a straight line, respectively on and under the 
warp and parallel to this latter, constituting a 

"square" cycle, 
means (35) (36) (37) (38) (39), or a 
programmed electronic control unit, for displacing in 

rectangular motion members (34) adapted to detain 
temporarily the weft or wefts of the decorative 

effect (6), 
programmable control means (22) adapted to 
act on the distribution means for the decorative 

weft (6) so that its displacements can be modified at 
will. 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
in that the distribution means for the decorative 

weft or wefts (6) comprise at least one yarn guide 
(15) supporting said weft (6), said yarn guide (15) 

being coupled to a transfer carriage (16) 
displaceable in straight line motion, control of 

which is provided by a programmable central unit. 
Device as claimed in Claim 3, characterized 
in that the yarn guide or guides (15) secured to the 

transfer carriage are displaceable, on guide bars, at 
right angles to the warp yarns of the basic textile 

backing, with the carriage (16) cooperating with a 
drive system (20) (21) coupled to an electronically 

controlled stepping motor (22). 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
in that the control means for the bonding needles (5) 

for forming the locking mesh comprise an oscillating 
support (8) receiving said needles (5) which are  

 
mounted in a needle rod, said support (8) cooperating 

with members (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) for driving 
and for transforming motion, so as to submit all of 

said needles to vertical straight line to-and-fro 
movement through, on and under the basic textile 

backing. 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
in that the means for applying motion in an arc of a 

circle to the support or supports (23) receiving the 
locking mesh yarn (4) consist of a crank arm (25) and 

crank (26) system under the control of the support 
that receives the bonding needles for forming the 

locking mesh, with said system working through a 
crank on a shaft (03), on which the binding guides 

that receive the locking mesh are mounted. 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
in that the means for displacing, in rectangular 

motion, the members (34) that are adapted for the 
temporary retention of the weft or wefts of the 

decorative effect consist of a deformable 
parallelogram system (36) (37) (38) (39), or an 

electronic programmable control system. 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
in that the programmable control means adapted to act 

on the means for distributing the decorative weft so 
as to modify its displacement
 at will, consist of a 
stepping motor (22) controlled electronically by 

integrating two parameters, namely an amplitude of 
the decorative weft in a direction at right angles to 

the warp yarns and in displacement to right or left, 
and a frequency of movements, or not, at each 

revolution of the loom.
