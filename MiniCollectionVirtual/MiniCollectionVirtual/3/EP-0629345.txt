<ABSTRACT>
Composition for controlling insects, especially Homoptera, Coleoptera and Thysanoptera and for controlling acarians (mites), characterised in that it contains, in a suitable vehicle, as active principle, a mixture comprising:     - at least one anionic surface-active agent, and - at least one chemical mediator acting on the behaviour of the target insects and acarians and chosen from pheromonal substances and allelochemical substances.   The invention also relates to a preventive or curative method for protecting a site against the insects and acarians which prey upon the cultures, which is characterised in that it comprises the application of the abovementioned composition to a site.

<CLAIMS>
A process for protecting, as a preventive or
curative measure, a site against crop predatory insects and

mites, characterized in that it comprises the step of
applying to the site a composition containing in a suitable

vehicle, as an active principle, a mixture comprising :

at least one anionic surfactant chosen among the anionic
surfactants having an inhibitory action upon the

formation of cuticula of the target-insects and -mites;
and
at least one chemical mediator capable of modifying the
behavior of the target-insects and -mites and chosen

among pheromonal substances and allelochemical
substances.
The process according to Claim 1, characterized
by the fact that the anionic surfactant has a HLB value of at

least 10.
The process according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized by the fact that the anionic surfactant is

chosen among the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal or
ammonium or triethanolamine salts of dialkyl esters of

sulphosuccinic acid and the alkali metal or alkaline-earth
metal salts of esters of sulfuric acid and saturated or

unsaturated fatty alcohols.
The process according to anyone of the
preceding Claims, characterized by the fact that the anionic

surfactant is sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium dioctyl
sulphosuccinate.
The process according to anyone of the
preceding Claims, characterized by the fact that the chemical

mediator is chosen from the group consisting of nerolidol,
cineole, alpha-pinene, farnesol, geraniol, anisaldehyde,

trans-beta-farnesene, citral, coumarin and compatible
mixtures thereof.
The process according to anyone of the
preceding Claims, characterized by the fact that said 

composition further comprises at least one retentive agent
capable of retaining a volatile product.

by the fact that the retentive agent is chosen from the group

consisting of undecylenic acid, methyl undecylenate and
castor oil.
The process according to Claim 6 or 7,
characterized by the fact that said composition is applied in

the form of a concentrate to be diluted (at 2% - 2â€°) with
water before use, this concentrate comprising :


50 to 80% (w/v) of at least one anionic surfactant ;
0.01 to 10% (w/v) of at least one chemical mediator ;
and

preceding Claims, characterized by the fact that the

different components are applied separately to the site so as
to form the composition in situ.
Use for controlling insects, especially
Homoptera, Coleoptera and Thysanoptera, and for controlling

mites, of a composition containing in a suitable vehicle, as
an active principle, a mixture comprising :


at least one anionic surfactant chosen among the anionic
surfactants having an inhibitory action upon the

formation of cuticula of the target-insects and -mites ;
and
at least one chemical mediator capable of modifying the
behavior of the target-insects and -mites and chosen

among pheromonal substances and allelochemical
