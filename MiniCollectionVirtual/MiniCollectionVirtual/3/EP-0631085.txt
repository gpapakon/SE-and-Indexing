<ABSTRACT>
Clamping collar consisting of a metal strip (1, 11, 21b-21d), wound on itself, one of the ends of which has an ear (2, 12, 22) projecting radially from the outer periphery of the collar and the other end of which is shaped into a hook (3, 13, 23) capable of being clipped behind the ear in order to keep the collar tight. On its face (2b, 12b, 22b) situated on the side opposite the zone where the hook bears after clipping, the ear is equipped with a member (5, 12c, 22c) which forms part of it and one zone of which is capable of coming into abutted contact with the internal face (3b, 13b, 23b) of the hook when the latter is being clipped over the ear, therefore preventing any relative movement of the hook relative to the ear and consequently any increase in the extent to which the collar is clamped.

A clamp fitting constituted by a metal band (1) wound on itself, of
which one of the ends presents an ear (2) radially projecting on the outer

periphery of the clamp and of which the other end is shaped as a hook (3)
capable of hooking behind the ear to maintain the clamp tightened,

characterised in that, the ear (2) being inclined in the direction opposite the
extremity of the inner band end which bears it, the face (2b) of said ear that

is located opposite the hook-bearing zone after hooking includes a boss (5)
having a front face (5a) that is straightened out towards the extremity of the

inner band end with respect to the ear, said boss (5) constituting a stop

member that is integral with the ear (2) and of which a zone (5a), formed by
the front face of said boss, is capable of coming into stop contact with the

inner face of the hook (3) when the latter is being hooked on the ear, thus
preventing any relative displacement of the hook with respect to the ear in a

direction opposite the extremity of the inner end bearing said ear and
consequently any increase in the tightening of the clamp.
The clamp fitting constituted by a metal band (11, 21b-21d)
wound on itself, of which one of the ends presents an ear (12, 22) radially

projecting on the outer periphery of the clamp and of which the other end is
shaped as a hook (13, 23) capable of hooking behind the ear to maintain

the clamp tightened, characterised in that the inner end band that bears the
ear (12, 22) has an extension (12c, 22c) of the fold (12b, 22b) of the ear

opposite the hook-bearing zone after hooking, said extension extending
substantially along the periphery of the clamp and its free end being shaped

to come into stop contact with the inner face (13b, 23b) of the hook, said
extension (12c, 22c) constituting a stop member that is integral with the ear

and of which a zone, formed by the free end of said extension, is capable of
coming into stop contact with the inner face (13b, 23b) of the hook when the

latter is being hooked on the ear, thus preventing any relative displacement
of the hook with respect to the ear in a direction opposite the extremity of

the inner end bearing said ear and consequently any increase in the
tightening of the clamp.
The clamp according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that, after
hooking, the stop contact zone of the stop member is located, with respect

to the inner face of the hook, at a peripheral distance (d), minimum and 
strictly necessary for unhooking, taking into account the geometry of the

complementary bearing zones of the hook and the ear.
