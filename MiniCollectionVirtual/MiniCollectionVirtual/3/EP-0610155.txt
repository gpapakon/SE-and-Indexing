<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to stabilized polyamide compositions and, in 
particular, to stabilized polyamide compositions comprising polyamides and complexes of 
copper salts. Polyamides, commonly referred to as nylons, are a widely used class of thermoplastic 
engineering resins characterized by excellent lubricity, wear resistance and chemical 
resistance. While polyamides provide significant benefits, these resins and related 
polyamide blends have certain disadvantages. Most notably, polyamides often can 
undergo degradation on exposure to heat and sun light. Prior to the present invention, 
polyamides have been stabilized against the deleterious effects of heat and light by the 
addition of small amounts of copper salts, most often in combination with alkali metal 
halide salts (see, e.g., U.S. patents 2,630,421 and 2,705,227). However, while inexpensive 
and very effective, stabilization systems containing copper salts do not provide a complete 
solution to the problems of heat and light stability in polyamides because such systems 
suffer from a number of disadvantages as shown below. Under certain conditions, copper salts have a tendency to form insoluble precipitates 
which clog filters and fiber spinnerets (see, e.g., U.S. patents 2,960,498 and 3,359,235). In 
addition, metallic copper occasioned by disproportionation can "plate out" on metal 
surfaces which are in contact with the copper-containing polyamide. Furthermore, not 
only are copper salts hygroscopic, making handling and storage difficult, but such salts 
also are water soluble and may be removed from the polyamide during leaching, aqueous 
scouring of fiber, or during end-use (see, e.g., U.S. patent 4,745,006). Polyamides 
commonly contain additional additives including, inter alia, dyes, pigments and ultraviolet 
absorbers. Copper salts also have a tendency to form complexes with certain dyes and 
pigments, making it difficult to obtain desired color tones (see, e.g., UK patent 1,148,244). 
Moreover, copper salts can produce excessive discoloration when used in combination 
with common ultraviolet absorbers (e.g., o-hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles).  U.S. patent 3,499,867 issued to Nakamura et al. describes polyamide compositions 
comprising an aliphatic or aromatic polyamide and from about 0.001 to about 1% by 
weight of a pre-formed copper complex prepared by heating a divalent copper salt at a 
temperature of from 100 to 140°C with a lactam moiety having from 5 to about 12 carbon 
atoms or an amino-saturated aliphatic
