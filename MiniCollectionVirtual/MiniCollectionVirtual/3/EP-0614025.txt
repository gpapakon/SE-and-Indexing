<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an adjusting device for a disc brake, particularly a floating-calliper disc brake. The adjusting device has at least one pressure spindle, which rests against a brake shoe and is screwed into a pressure piece that can be subjected to pressure in a direction towards a brake disc by rotating a brake application shaft, and further has a gearing between the brake application shaft and the pressure spindle. The gearing comprises an elastic element for the rotational coupling of the brake application shaft and the pressure spindle.

Adjusting device for a disc brake, in particular a
floating caliper disc brake, having at least one

pressure screw (10), which rests against a brake shoe
(3) and is screwed into a thrust pad (9), which

through rotation of a brake application shaft (8) may
be acted upon by pressure in the direction of a brake

disc (2), and having a gearing (15) between the brake
application shaft (8) and the pressure screw (10),

wherein the gearing (15) couples the pressure screw
(10) in such a way to the brake application shaft (8)

that during the no-load stroke of the brake, i.e.
during the movement of the brake shoe (3) up to its

abutment with the brake disc (2), a first adjusting
motion of the pressure screw (10) is effected,


characterized in that
 the gearing (15) comprises an
elastic element (20) for the rotational coupling of

brake application shaft (8) and pressure screw (10),
which elastic element during the power stroke as a

result of deformation stores energy which upon release
of the brake may be re-released in the form of a

second adjusting motion.
Adjusting device according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the elastic element (20) is a torsion spring.
Adjusting device according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the elastic element (20) is a
helical spring.
Adjusting device according to claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 the coupling (21, 29) of the helical spring
(20) to the brake application shaft (8) and/or the

pressure screw (10) defines the lifting clearance (S)
of the brake.
Adjusting device according to claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the coupling (21, 29) comprises a pin-and-slot 
connection, in which the pin (21) engages into the

slot (29) with the clearance corresponding to the
brake lifting clearance (S).
Adjusting device according to claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that
 the helical spring (20) is
preloaded in the direction of rotation and/or axially.
Adjusting device according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the gearing (15) is
disposed at the side of the brake application shaft

(8) remote from the brake disc.
Adjusting device according to one of claims 5 to 7,

characterized in that
 the slot (29) opens towards the
side of the brake application shaft (8) remote from

the brake disc.
Adjusting device according to one of claims 2 to 8,

characterized in that
 the torsion spring (20) is
coupled parallel to the other elements (23, 24, 25) of

the gearing (15).
Adjusting device according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 at least one element
(25) of the gearing (15) is coupled by an axially

preloading spring element (26) in a releasable form
closure directly or indirectly to the pressure screw

(10), the spring force of the spring element (26)
being greater than the stiffness of the elastic

element (20).
