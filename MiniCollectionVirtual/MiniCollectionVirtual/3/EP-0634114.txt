An articulated dress form construction, 
specifically designed for patterning and testing 

cloth and hat articles for children and teen-agers, 
characterized in that said dress-form construction 

is designed and sized based on a plurality of parameters 
derived from a basic physical configuration, 

said parameters being processed by computer means, 
so as to provide mathematic models or patterns 

adapted to make a plurality of dress-forms meeting 
said requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
dress form
for patterning and testing cloth and hat articles for
children and teen-agers, as defined in the preamble of claim
1 and known from US-A-4 885 844.As is known, for properly preparing cloth
articles in general, it is necessary to use a dress
form reproducing the actual construction or shape
of a human body.At present these dress forms are made according
to a very reduced number of morphologic shapes
and size.Accordingly, these prior dress forms do not
allow a good evaluation of the cloth article being
made, and this in particular with respect to its
dressing characteristics.Accordingly, the aim of the present invention
is to overcome the above mentioned problems,
by providing an articulated dress form construction,
which reproduces a plurality of physical shapes and
size of a child or teen-ager, so as to allow the
possibility of testing and monitoring the proper
dressing characteristics of cloth articles in general 
such as T-shirts, pullover, trousers, jackets and
the like, specifically provided to be worn by children
and teen-agers.Within the scope of the above mentioned aim,
a main object of the present invention is to provide
such a dress-form construction which is very reliable
and safe in operation and which can be specifically
used for patterning and testing hat articles for
children and teen-agers.According to one aspect of the present invention,
the above mentioned aim and objects, as
well as yet other objects, which will become more
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a
dress-form for
patterning and testing cloth and hat articles for
children and teen-agers according to claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of 
the present invention will become more apparent from
the following detailed disclosure of a preferred,
though not exclusive, embodiment of an articulated
dress-form construction reproducing the body of a
child, and being illustrated, by way of an indicative,
but not limitative, example, in the accompanying
drawings, where:
Figure 1 is a side perspective view of the
articulated dress form construction according to
the present invention;
andFigure 2 is a front perspective view of that
same dress form construction.With reference to the number references of
the figures of the accompanying drawings, the subject
articulated dress form construction, particularly
designed for patterning and testing child and
teen-ager cloth and hat articles, which has been
indicated generally at the reference number 1, has
been specifically designed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dress-form (1) for patterning and
testing cloth and hat articles for children and

teen-agers, said dress-form being designed and
sized based on a plurality of parameters derived

from a basic physical configuration, said
parameters being processed by computer means, so as

to provide mathematic models or patterns adapted to
make a plurality of dress-forms meeting said

requirements, characterized in that said processed
parameters comprise a series of weighed averaged

values adapted to allow to make several types of
dress-forms faithfully corresponding to several

different physical configurations, and that said
dress-form is an articulated dress-form, has a

height from 60 to 170 centimeters, and is
provided with a head portion up to a height of 118

centimeters, and with articulated elements in
particular at the shoulders (2), elbows (3), hip

regions (4), knees (5) and feet (6) thereof.
A dress-form (1) according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the specific value assigned

to said basic physical configuration is defined
depending on different types of children and teenagers,

that is regular, robust, long-limbed types 
and the like.
A dress-form according to Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that said value is processed by

means of data derived from the height and size of
the child or teen-ager.
