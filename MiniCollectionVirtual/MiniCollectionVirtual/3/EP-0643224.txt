<ABSTRACT>
A scroll type compressor which prevents occurrence 
of abnormally high pressures due to liquid compression at 

the time of startup so as to lighten the engine load by 
providing a projection (100a) on the end face of the shaft (100) and a 

groove (101a) in which the projection fits in the end face of 
the bush (101) supporting a movable scroll member (200), the 

projection and groove being arranged so that their 
abutting faces (100d,101d) are inclined a predetermined angle 

(Θ) with 
respect to a line connecting the center (100b) of the shaft and 

the center (101b) of the bush in the direction opposite to the 
rotational direction of the shaft and being positioned 

relative to each other so that the extension line of the 
abutting faces passes through the side opposite to the 

side where the center of the bush is positioned seen from 
the center of the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scroll type 
compressor suitable for use as a refrigerant compressor 
for an automobile air-conditioner. Such a scroll type compressor is disclosed in 
numerous patents and references and the principles behind 
its operation are well known. In a scroll type compressor, several hermetic 
spaces are created enclosed by a plurality of contact 
lines formed by a fixed scroll member and movable scroll 
member engaging with each other. When the movable scroll 
member performs revolutionary motion, the contact lines 
move from the outer periphery toward the center along the 
walls of the spiral bodies. Along with this, the enclosed 
hermetic spaces also move toward the center and 
compresses a refrigerant or other fluid while being 
reduced in volume. Since a plurality of these contact lines are 
formed, however, the shapes of the spiral bodies must be 
kept to an error from the predetermined shapes on the 
order of several microns. Further, strict precision of 
the relative positions of the two scroll members is 
required. If these errors become too great, they end up 
separating at one of the plurality of contact lines and 
the hermetic degree of the space to be hermetically 
sealed falls, so the amount of discharge falls, the power 
consumption rises, and an abnormally high temperature 
operation state is caused. Accordingly, in a scroll type 
compressor, it is necessary to make the precision of 
processing of the spiral bodies and the precision of 
assembly of the two scroll members extremely high. This 
is the main reason why scroll type compressors were not  
 
put into practical use for a long time. There are also 
various difficulties even with today's processing 
technologies and assembly technologies. To solve these problems in a scroll type 
compressor, proposal has been made in numerous patent 
specifications of a means for changing the radius of the 
revolutionary motion of the movable scroll member along 
with the shape of the scroll member. For example, in the 
compressor disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 2-176179, which forms the basis for the preamble of claim 1, the end of the shaft is 
provided with a drive projection having a planar face, 
the bush for giving revolutionary motion to the movable 
scroll member is provided with a groove having a planar 
face, and the drive projection is fitted slidingly in the 
groove. It has been proposed that the planar face of the 
drive projection be inclined with respect to the line 
connec

A scroll type compressor comprised of 

a fixed scroll member (301) having an end plate 
and a spiral body formed on the end plate, 
a movable scroll member (200) having an end 
plate and a spiral body formed on the end plate and 

assembled so as to engage with the fixed scroll 
member (301) shifted from its center, 
a shaft (100) which receives its rotation to 
rotate, 
a bush (101) which is disposed eccentric to the 
center (100b) of rotation of the shaft (100) and gives a 

revolutionary motion to the movable scroll member (200), 
and 
a rotation preventing mechanism (600) which 
allows only revolution of the movable scroll member (200) 

and inhibits free rotation, 
the revolutionary motion of the movable scroll 
member (200) being used for movement of the spiral body 

in the center direction while the hermetic spaces between 
the movable scroll member (200) and the fixed scroll 

member (301) are reduced in volume and thereby for 
compression of the fluid inside the hermetic spaces, 
the end plate of the movable scroll 
member (200) having formed on it a portion for engagement 

with the bush (101) for allowing rotation of the 
bush (101) and at the same time receiving a revolution 

drive force, either one of the shaft (100) and the 
bush (101) being provided with a projection (100a) having 

at least one abutting face (100d), 
the other of the shaft (100) and the bush (101) 
being provided with a groove (101a) having an abutting 

face (101d) able to come into facial contact with the 
abutting face (100d) of the projection (100a), 
the groove (101a) being engaged with the 
projection (100a) so as to enable the bush (101) to move 

along the abutting face (101d) of the groove (101a),  
 
the abutting face (100d, 101d) being set so as 
to be inclined with respect to a line passing through the 

center (101b) of the bush (101) and the center (100b) of 
the shaft (100) in a direction opposite to the direction 

of rotation of the shaft (100), characterized in that the abutting 
face (100d, 101d) or the extension line of the same 

passes through the side opposite to the side where the 
center (101b) of the bush (101) is present as seen from 

the center (100b) of the shaft (100).

projection (100a) are each provided with two parallel 
faces (100d, 100h, 101d, 101h).
