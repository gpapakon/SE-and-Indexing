<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a microwave resonator comprising a cavity (50) defined, at least in part, by a generally cylindrical wall (64) having an electrically conductive inner surface and containing a generally cylindrical piece of low loss dielectric material (22), characterised by forming a generally cylindrical piece of low loss dielectric material of predetermined size and placing same in a cavity to produce a microwave resonator which operates in a particular mode at a specific frequency at a particular temperature. Microwave radiation corresponding to a further operating mode is then passed into the cavity and then the frequency corresponding to the further operating mode is searched for and measured. A further generally cylindrical piece of dielectric material is produced by scaling from the first piece of dielectric material according to the ratio between the first and second frequencies. Then, the diameter and/or height of the cavity is varied to compensate for manufacturing inaccuracies in the crystal so as to obtain an output frequency close to the desired output frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microwave resonator.Modern radar and telecommunications systems require high
frequency signal sources and signal processing systems with
stringent performance requirements and extremely good
spectral purity.Thus, there is a need for signal processing systems and
signal sources with ever increasing spectral purity,
stability and power-handling requirements.Resonators by their nature provide discrimination of wanted
signals from unwanted signals. The purity and stability of
the signals produced is directly linked to the resonator
used as the frequency determining device and is dependent
upon its Q-factor, power handling ability and its immunity
to vibrational and temperature related effects.It is known that a piece of dielectric material has
self-resonant modes in the electromagnetic spectrum that
are determined by its dielectric constant and physical
dimensions. The spectral properties of a given mode in a
piece of dielectric material are determined by the
intrinsic properties of the dielectric material, its
geometric shape, the radiation pattern of the mode and the
properties and dimensions of the materials surrounding or
near the dielectric.Prior art resonators have traditionally relied on metallic
cavities containing no dielectric material, or on metallic 
cavities containing a dielectric material which were limited in Q-factor by the
properties of the metallic cavity and hence were operated at cryogenic temperatures in
order to obtain a better Q-factor. However, to maintain cryogenic temperatures
requires equipment which is cumbersome and difficult to incorporate into a portable
or compact apparatus.JP-A-62-183608 discloses altering the dielectric present in the cavity to effect
tuning of the frequency of the dielectric resonator. There is no disclosure of adjusting
the dimensions of the cavity.JP-A-62299103 describes a plated dielectric and removing the plating to alter
the resonant frequency.JP-A-2-60207 appears to disclose altering the diameter and shape of a hole
formed in the top of a resonator cavity, not variation of the diameter and/or height of
the cavity itself.AltaFrequenza, Vol, 57. No. 7, September 1988, pages 389-398 V.
