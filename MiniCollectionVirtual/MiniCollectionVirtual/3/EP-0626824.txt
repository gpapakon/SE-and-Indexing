Device for transanal resectate extractions, 
having 


a) a rectoscope sleeve (1) provided with a proximally 
disposed tubular end-piece (4), 
b) a connecting-piece (2), by means of which the tubular 
end-piece (4) can be tightly sealed, and which includes 

a bore, which extends parallel to the axis of the 
rectoscope sleeve (1) and the axis of the tubular 

end-piece (4), 
 
characterised by 


c) a resectate extractor (3) for picking-up, guiding and 
positioning a gripping means, said extractor having a 

tubular portion (7) and a protector portion (8), which 
is mounted at the distal end of the tubular portion (7), 

the length of the tubular portion (7) exceeding the 
length of the rectoscope sleeve (1), so that the 

gripping means is positionable anorectally at the 
particular location, the tubular portion (7) being 

guidable through the bore of the connecting-piece (2) 
with little clearance, and the protector portion (8) 

having a through-bore and having an external diameter in 
the range of between the internal diameter of the 

rectoscope sleeve (1) and the external diameter of the 
tubular portion (7). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the tubular end-piece includes at least two angular 

recesses (9), through which unilaterally retained webs 
(10) extend, said webs being resilient at the edge of 

the end-piece (4), and the connecting-piece comprises an 
axially pierced cylinder (5), on the surface of which  

 
are disposed at least two pins (11), which engage in the 

angular recesses (9). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that a U-shaped clamping device (6), which surrounds 

the bore, is mounted on the proximal side of the 
connecting-piece (2). 
Device according to claim 1 or 3, characterised 
in that a freely displaceable U-shaped clamping device 

(12) is mounted on the tublar portion (7) of the 
resectate extractor (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the protector portion (8) extends into a domed 

protector region (15) via a conical transitional region 
(13) and a cylindrical region (14), the diameter of the 

through-bore of the protector portion (8) corresponding 
to the internal diameter of the tubular portion (7). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the protector portion (7) extends via a conical 

transitional region (13) into a cylindrical region (16), 
which is open at its end face, the cylindrical region 

(16) which is open at its end face surrounding a 
cylindrical interior. 
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised 
in that the U-shaped clamping device (6, 12) 


as two aligned bores in the legs of the "U", 
a thread is cut into one of the bores, 
a screw through one of the bores engages in the bore 
provided with the thread, and 
the shaft of the screw is configured as handle (17). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the handle (17) constitutes an externally grooved 

sleeve. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a gas inlet pipe (18) is incorporated in the 

tubular end-piece (4) of the rectoscope sleeve (1). 
Device according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the gas inlet pipe (18) is configured as the 

handle.
