<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a timepiece with a casing which on two opposite sides has a respective face 8 and 9 and hour and minute hands 4-7 which can be driven by a common mechanism. The minute hand 6 of the first side is arranged fixedly on a minute arbour 16, which can be driven rotatably by the mechanism and which bears a first cannon pinion 20, by which, via a first minute wheel, a first hour cannon pinion 21, which is mounted rotatably on the first cannon pinion 20, can be driven rotatably. In the region of that end which faces away from the first minute hand 6 the minute arbour 16 bears a main wheel 22 by means of which the second cannon pinion 23, which is mounted rotatably parallel to the axis of the minute arbour 16, bears the second minute hand 7 and has the same number of teeth as the main wheel 22, can be driven rotatably. By means of the second cannon pinion 23 a second minute wheel 27 can be driven rotatably, by means of which second minute wheel a second hour cannon pinion 33, which is mounted rotatably on the second cannon pinion 23 and bears the second hour hand 4, can be driven rotatably.

<CLAIMS>
Timepiece with a casing which, on two opposite
sides, has in each case one dial (8, 9), as well as

hour hands (5, 4) and minute hands (6, 7), which can be
driven by a common mechanism, the minute hand (6) of

the first side being arranged fixedly on a minute
arbour (16), which can be driven in rotation by the

mechanism and bears a first cannon pinion (20), by
which, via a first minute wheel, a first hour cannon

pinion (21), which is mounted rotatably on the first
cannon pinion (20), can be driven in rotation, the

minute arbour (16), in the region of that end which is
remote from the first minute hand (6), bears a drive

wheel (22), by means of which a second cannon pinion
(23), which is mounted rotatably parallel to the axis

of the minute arbour (16), bears the second minute hand
(7) and has the same number of teeth as the drive wheel

(22), can be driven in rotation, and having a second
minute wheel (27), which can be driven in rotation by

the second cannon pinion (23) and by means of which a
second hour cannon pinion (33), which is mounted

rotatably on the second cannon pinion (23) and bears
the second hour hand (4), can be driven in rotation,

characterized in that a coupling wheel (31), which is
mounted so that it can rotate coaxially with respect to

the second hour cannon pinion (33) and can be connected
in a rotationally fixed manner to the second hour

cannon pinion (33) via a manually releasable coupling, 
can be driven in rotation by the second minute wheel

(27).
Timepiece according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the second cannon pinion (23) is mounted

rotatably on a bearing pin (25) arranged on a train bar
(26).
Timepiece according to Claim 2, characterized

in that a second bearing pin (28), on which the second
minute wheel (27) is rotatably mounted, is arranged on

the train bar (26).
Timepiece according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the coupling is a spring-loaded latching

coupling (32), by means of which the coupling wheel
(31) and the second hour cannon pinion (33) can be

rotated in a stepwise manner relative to one another.
Timepiece according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the second hour cannon pinion (33) and the

coupling wheel (31) can be rotated in hourly steps
relative to one another.
Timepiece according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the latching coupling (32) has a spring arm

(37), which is attached at one end to the second hour
cannon pinion (33) or the coupling wheel (31), extends

approximately radially and at its other, free end
engages resiliently in a tooth space of a cog (35)

which is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to
the coupling wheel (31) or the second hour cannon

pinion (33).
Timepiece according to Claim 6, characterized
in that the spring arm (37) extends approximately

tangentially with respect to the cog (35) and engages
in a tooth space of the cog (35) by means of an obtuse-angled

latching tooth (38) arranged at its free end.
Timepiece according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the cog (35) has twelve tooth spaces.
Timepiece according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the coupling wheel (31) is mounted so that it

can rotate freely on the second hour cannon pinion
(33). 
Timepiece according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the second hour cannon pinion (33) can be

rotated relative to the coupling wheel (31) by means of
a manually actuable adjustment device.
Timepiece according to Claim 10, characterized
in that the second hour cannon pinion (33) has a

toothed ring (36), into which a correction finger (39)
can be pivoted, out of a disengaged position into an

engaged position, and into which the second hour cannon
pinion (33) can be pivoted so that it can be advanced

by about one rotary step.
Timepiece according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the correction finger (39) is spring-loaded

into its disengaged position.
Timepiece according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the pivoting travel of the correction finger

(39) is limited by stops (41 and 42).
Timepiece according to Claim 11, characterized
in that the correction finger (39) has a pivotable

catch (47), which forms a tooth-turning barrier, for
engaging in the toothed ring (36), which catch, in the

event of a pivoting movement of the correction finger
(39), can be pivoted out of the engaged position to the

disengaged position, counter to a spring force, out of
the tooth spaces of the toothed ring (35).
Timepiece according to Claim 14, characterized
in that the pivoting travel of the catch (47) is

limited by stops (49 and 50).
