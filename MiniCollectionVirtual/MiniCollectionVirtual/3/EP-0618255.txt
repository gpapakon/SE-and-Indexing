<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to flame retardant polyolefin
compositions containing a flame retardant admixture. In
particular, propylene polymer compositions containing a flame
retardant admixture of bismuth carbonate and a brominated
aromatic compound.Various methods to provide polyolefin materials with
flame-resistance are known in the art. For example, US-A-4,010,139
discloses a self-extinguishing polyolefinic
composition containing (a) a polyolefin selected from the
group consisting of homopolymers and copolymer of ethylene,
alpha-olefins and styrene; and (b) a mixture of: (1) a bismuth
compound selected from the group consisting of basic bismuth
carbonate and triphenyl-bismuthine; and (2) a partially
halogenated compound which is capable of breaking down in the
presence of heat to form the corresponding halogen halide.US-B1-4,710,528 (Reexamined US-A-4,710,528) describes flame
resistant thermoplastic polymeric compositions comprising (A)
from 60 to 98.9% of a thermoplastic polymer; (B) from 0.1 to
10% of an antimony and/or bismuth compound; (C) 0.05 to 1% of
a promoter of free radicals; and (D) from 1 to 35% of a
melamine bromohydrate.US-A-4,203,882 discloses impact resistant polymer
compositions having flame-resistance properties comprising (1)
a blend of a thermoplastic block propylene-ethylene copolymer
and an elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer; (2) 0.5 to 5%
of basic bismuth carbonate (BiO)2CO3; (3) 0.3 to 1.3% of a
triazine compound; (4) 2 to 10% of a chlorinated paraffin wax;
and (5) 0.5 to 10% of a bromine containing organic compound. US-A-5,079,283 discloses a flame-retardant polypropylene
composition comprising a modified polypropylene-based polymer,
antimony oxide or sodium antimonate and a halogenated organic
compound or a phosphorous containing compound.US-A-5,166,235 discloses concentrates of a flame
retardant additives, in the form of nonextruded particles, of
which each one comprising (A) a matrix of a nonextruded, as
polymerized particle of a polymer or copolymer of olefins
having porosity greater than or equal to 15%, expressed as a
percent of the void volume on the total volume of the
particle, (B) the product of reaction between bismuth or
antimony trichloride or tribromide, or their mixtures, and one
or more amines; wherein said product (B) is made "in situ" and
deposited on the surface of the matrix and inside the pores
thereof.SU-A-1052518 describes a flame-resistant polypropylene
composition containing 100 parts of polypropylene, 3-8 parts
of basic bismuth carbonate, 2-4
