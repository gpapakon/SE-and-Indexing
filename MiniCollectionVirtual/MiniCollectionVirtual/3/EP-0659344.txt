<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to dry granular yeast 
compositions for use in the production of bakery products 

and beverages. In particular, the invention provides a dry 
granular yeast composition having a moisture content of not 

more than about 8% (w/w) and containing about 0.1 to 8% 
(w/w) of a bread-improving agent, wherein the dry yeast is 

present in granular form and said bread-improving agent is 
present in a form selected from 


(a) a granulate having substantially the same 
granule size as the dry yeast, and 
(b) a coating on the dry yeast granules in the 
form of a film or adhered particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dry yeast
compositions, the production thereof and their use in bakery
products and beverages.The manufacture of a yeast composition starts with a
small sample of a pure culture. This sample is used to
inoculate the first of a series of fermentations in
fermenters of successively increasing size. The first few
are mildly aerated batch fermentations. Only the last two
(or sometimes three) stages are performed using full
aeration and incremental feeding of molasses. These fedbatch
fermentations are carried out in fermenters having a
volume of 100m3 or more. Fermentation is typically carried
out for a total of 12-20 hours during which time about
10,000-30,000 kg of compressed yeast is produced.Further processing includes separating the yeast
from the broth by centrifugation and washing which results
in a yeast cream (17-23% (w/w) dry matter content).The yeast cream may be processed into compressed
yeast (27-33% (w/w) dry matter content) which is either sold
as such or extruded and dried to produce active dry yeast
(ADY) or instant dry yeast (IDY) with moisture contents of
6-8% (w/w) and 2-8% w/w), respectively.In the case of ADY, drying usually takes place in
belt or rotolouvre (drum) dryers. For IDY production,
fluidized-bed drying is commonly used. Drying of the yeast
to a level of about 20% w/w water content involves only the
evaporation of free water. Further reduction of the moisture
content requires removal of a portion of the bound water
from the yeast which may cause damage to the yeast cell 
membrane. US patents 3,843,800 and 4,248,420 describe use in
such a drying process of a wetting agent such as a glycerol
ester and/or fatty acid ester of propylene glycol so as to
preserve the desired high direct leavening activity of the
yeast.Dry yeast loses part of its leavening activity
during both drying and rehydration. Dry yeasts are still
commonly used in the bakery trade because of their extended
stability and because refrigeration is unnecessary. Dry
yeasts are used in wine making to obtain a fast and
reproducible fermentation thereby avoiding the risk of
failure of natural fermentation. Moreover, the yeast is
immediately available throughout the year.Instant dry yeast (IDY) is the latest type of
baker's yeast, which was introduced in the early 1970s (see
for example US patent 3,843,800). This was followed a few
years later by introduction of instant dry wine yeast (IWY),
which can be regarded as a special form of instant dry
yeast. To obtain a high quality IDY,

<CLAIMS>
A dry granular yeast composition having a moisture content of not
more than about 8% (w/w) and containing about 0.1 to 8% (w/w) of a

bread-improving agent, wherein the dry yeast is present in granular form,
and wherein the bread-improving agent comprises one or more enzymes

and/or ascorbic acid and is present as a coating on the dry yeast granules
in the form of particles adhered to said granules by an adhesive.
A composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least 50%
preferably at least 80%, of said adhered particles have a diameter of less

than 50 
µ
m.
A composition as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said bread-improving
agent is present in the form of particles adhered to the dry

yeast by means of an adhesive comprising one or more edible oils,
triglycerids and liquid fats.
A composition as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the bread-improving agent comprises at least one of a

hemicellulase and an α-amylase.
A process for the production of a composition as claimed in any
one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein dry yeast granules having a moistur
e
content of not more than about 8% (w/w) are mixed with smaller

particles of a bread-improving agent in the presence of an adhesive so
that said yeast granules become coated with particles of the bread-improving

agent. 
Use of a composition as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4 for
incorporation into a dough or for fermentation of a beverage.
