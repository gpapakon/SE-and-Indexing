<ABSTRACT>
A signal lighting device for a vehicle in which signal 
lamps (16-19) are each provided with a single filament and serve as 

a turn signal lamp as well as a side lamp. The signal lamps (16-19) 
are used for providing turning indication as well as 

vehicle-width side indication. Two oscillators (141,142) are used to 
drive the signal lamps (16-19), one of which (142) drives the 

signal lamps 
with a visually recognizable flashing frequency to provide 

turning indication. The other oscillator (141) drives the signal 
lamps with a visually unrecognizable high frequency to 

provide vehicle-width side indication. Also, a third 
oscillator (143) is used to drive a respective signal lamp at a 

frequency twice the visually recognizable flashing frequency 
when a corresponding signal lamp on the same side of the 

vehicle is broken and the vehicle is turned in that 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal lighting
apparatus in which signal lamps each provided with a single
filament and serving as a turn signal lamp as well as a side
lamp are used for a turning indication as well as a vehicle-width
(side) indication.A motorcycle having side lamps provided on both sides
of the vehicle which are lit during the running of the
vehicle is known (e.g. Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-15138).
As shown in Fig. 3, a conventional system includes
two front signal lamps 1 and 2 each having double filaments
1W(2W) and 1A(2A), the former for a front turn signal lamp
and the latter for a front side lamp. The conventional
system also includes two rear signal lamps 3 and 4, each
having a single filament and serving as a rear turn signal
lamp. Either one of the filaments 1W and 2W of the front
turn signal lamps in the front lamps 1 and 2 and the
filament in one of the rear lamps 3 and 4 which is on the
same side as the selected one of the front lamps 1 and 2 are
selectively supplied with electric power from a power source
8 through a winker relay 5 and a signal light operating
switch 6. Thus, either the left signal lamps 1 and 3 or the
right signal lamps 2 and 4 flash on and off according to the 
selected switch position of the signal light operating
switch 6.On the other hand, the filaments 1A and 2A of the side
lamps in the front signal lamps 1 and 2 are selectively
supplied with electric power from the power source 8 through
a side lamp switch 7, which is interlocked with the signal
light operating switch 6. The operation of the signal
lights 1 to 4 in relation to the switch positions of the
signal light operating switch 6 and the side lamp switch 7
is summarized as shown in Table 1.

switch is required as a right/left selector switch, which
consists of the signal light operating switch 6 for
selecting the turn signal lamps and the side lamp switch 7
interlocked with the signal light operating switch 6.
Furthermore, each of the front signal lamps is required to
have a double filament structure. The double filament
structure causes a lamp body to be large and such a lamp is
often specially made with increased costs. From Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 9, No. 307 (M-435)

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle signal lighting apparatus comprising:

front-right, front-left, rear-right and rear-left
signal lamps (16-19) each having a single

filament;
switch means (15) manually operable into right-turn,
left-turn and neutral positions indicative

of an intended traveling direction of the vehicle;
oscillation means (141, 142, 143) for generating
first and second oscillation signals of respective

first and second frequencies, said signal lamps
(16-19) flashing on and off in a visually

recognizable manner when driven by the first
oscillation signal and flashing on and off as if

continuously lit when driven by the second
oscillation signal,

characterized in that said oscillation means (141, 142,
143) are arranged to further generate a third

oscillation signal of a third frequency, said signal
lamps (16-19) flashing on and off in a visually

recognizable manner when driven by the third oscillation
signal which is different than when driven by the first

oscillation signal,

that lamp break detecting means (149) are provided for
detecting breakage of said signal lamps (16-19), and

that control means (144) are provided for selectively
driving said signal lamps (16-19) with the first, second

and third oscillation signals in accordance with a
selected position of said switch means (15) indicative

of the intended traveling direction of the vehicle and
in accordance with an output of said lamp break

detecting means (149), wherein when said switch means 
(15) is manipulated to either of the right-turn and

left-turn positions, said control means (144) drives the
front and rear signal lamps (16-19) corresponding to the

selected turn position with the first oscillation signal
and the front signal lamp (16, 17) corresponding to the

non-selected turn position with the second oscillation
