<ABSTRACT>
This method is for grasping a machining condition exactly irrespective of the mode of machining. On the screen of a display (1), the state that a work (2) is being drilled by a drill (4) is animated in the X-Z plane and displayed. The work (2) is clamped by a chuck (3). It rotates around the C-axis and moves in the Z-axis direction. The drill (4) makes a hole in the face (21) of the work (2) by C-axis drilling. On a part of the screen of the display (1), a window screen (10) is arranged. On the window screen (10), the view that the face (21) of the work (2) is observed is displayed in the X-Y plane. On this window screen (10), the positions and sizes of the holes (51 and 52) to be drilled in the face (21) are also displayed. As a result, the machined state of the face (21), which cannot be viewed by the display only in the X-Z plane, can be grasped exactly.
