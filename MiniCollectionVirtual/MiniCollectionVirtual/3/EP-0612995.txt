<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for automatically measuring the density of 
an object (1) which comprises a first weighing means (17) for 

weighing the object (1) in a first medium which is dry, a 
second weighing means (19) for weighing an object (1) in a second 

medium which is wet and a robotic device (21) having a first 
gripper means (27) to grip the object (1) when dry and a second 

gripper means (29) to grip the object (1) when wet the device (21) being 
capable of controlling the first gripper means (27) so as to 

place the object (1) on and remove it from the first weighing 
means (17) and for controlling the second gripper means (29) so as 

to place the object (1) on and remove it from the second 
weighing means (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a
method for automatically measuring the density of an
object.In certain industries an important parameter to
measure for quality assurance is the density of the
product at an intermediate or final production stage.
For example, in the production of nuclear fuel pellets
made from sintered UO2 it is necessary to ensure that the
density of the pellets is within a narrow specified range
to ensure that the pellets are suitable for their
application.In a known system for automatically measuring the
density of objects such as nuclear fuel pellets it is
known to measure the density by measuring the weight and
the volume and by dividing one by the other. The volume
is measured indirectly by measuring the dimensions of the
objects and applying a geometrical formula to calculate
the volume. Errors can occur if defects such as chips
exist on the surface of the object.US-A-3991619 describes a device for measuring the
density of a sample which weighs the sample first in air
on a hanger and then in water by immersing the sample on
the hanger. A disadvantage of this device is that the
hanger retains some water when weighing the subsequent
samples in air thus leading to inaccuracy in the measured
density.According to the present invention in a first aspect
there is provided apparatus for automatically measuring
the density of an object which comprises a first weighing
means for weighing the object in a first medium which is
dry, a second weighing means for weighing an object in a
second medium which is wet and a robotic device having a
first gripper means to grip the object when dry and a 
second gripper means to grip the object when wet the
device being capable of controlling the first gripper
means so as to place the object on and remove it from the
first weighing means and for controlling the second
gripper means so as to place the object on and remove it
from the second weighing means and a signal processor
which receives signals representing the weights of the
object when weighed in the first medium and when weighed
in the second medium, said signal processor being capable
of calculating the density (D) from said signals.Desirably, the apparatus also includes a stage on
which an object can be placed temporarily in the dry
medium whereby the object may be transferred from the
first gripper means after weighing by the first weighing
means to the second gripper means prior to being immersed
and weighed in the wet second medium.The first medium may conveniently be air

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for automatically measuring the density of
an object (1), the apparatus comprising a first weighing

means (17) for weighing the object in a first medium
which is dry, a second weighing means (19) for weighing

the object in a second medium which is wet and a robotic
device (21) having a first gripper means (27) to grip the

object when dry and a second gripper means (29) to grip
the object when wet, the device being capable of

controlling the first gripper means (27) so as to place
the object on (1a) and remove it from the first weighing

means and for controlling the second gripper means (29)
so as to place the object on (1b) and remove it from the

second weighing means and a signal processor which
receives signals representing the weights of the object

when weighed in the first medium and when weighed in the
second medium, said signal processor being capable of

calculating the density (D) from said signals.
Apparatus as in claim 1 and which also includes a
stage (32) on which an object can be placed temporarily

in the dry first medium.
Apparatus as in Claim 1 or Claim 2 and wherein the
first and second gripper means each comprise two or more

fingers which can grip the object by a known pneumatic
mechanism (31,33).
Apparatus as in Claim 1, 2 or 3 and wherein the
first (17) and second (19) weighing means each comprises

a weighing pan and an analytical balance capable of
providing an electrical output signal related to the

applied load. 
Apparatus as in Claim 4 and wherein the two weighing
pans are connected and the weights recorded by the two

weighing pans are arranged to be recorded by a common
balance.
Apparatus as in Claim 5 and wherein the balance is
such as to operate on the principle of electromagnetic

force compensation.
Apparatus as in Claim 5 or Claim 6 and wherein the
balance includes a facility for fully automatic

calibration.
