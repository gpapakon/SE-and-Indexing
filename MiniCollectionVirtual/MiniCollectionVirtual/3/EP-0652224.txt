<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a metallocene,
wherein a metal salt is reacted with at least one alkali

metal and with an unsaturated, cyclic hydrocarbon in the
presence of a solvent in one reaction step.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
molar ratio of alkali metal to metal salt is from 2 : 1

to 20 : 1.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
molar ratio of unsaturated, cyclic hydrocarbon to alkali

metal is from 1 : 1 to 10 : 1.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the preparation of the metallocene is carried out

at from -100 to +200Â°C and from 0.1 to 100 bar.
