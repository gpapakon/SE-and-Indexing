<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions are provided for specific binding assays in which specific binding reagents are immobilized on a solid phase. Immobilization is facilitated by covalently coupling specific binding assay reagents such as polypeptide receptors or analytes with water soluble polymers. Such water soluble polymers, for example star polymers such as dendrimers, provide production advantages of lot-to-lot uniformity and homogeneity, and can enhance sensitivity due to low non-specific binding to the solid phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of methods for
immobilizing specific binding assay reagents on a solid support. In particular
this invention relates to a method to immobilize reagents onto a solid phase
support using water soluble polymers. This invention also relates to a solid
phase support having immobilized reagents useful in diagnostics tests.In vitro diagnostic assays may be used to measure amounts of an
analyte found in a body fluid sample or tissue sample. The analyte must be
distinguished from other components found in the sample. Analytes may be
distinguished from other sample components by reacting the analyte with a
specific receptor for that analyte. Assays that utilize specific receptors to
distinguish and quantify analytes are often called specific binding assays.The most common receptors are antibodies and specific binding
proteins such as Intrinsic Factor or Folate Binding Protein. Receptors are
characterized by having a reversible specific binding affinity for an analyte or
an analogue of that analyte. The analogue generally is an analyte derivative
carrying a detectable marker such as an enzyme, fluorescent molecule or 
other known label but which binds to a receptor with about the same
specificity and affinity as the analyte.In heterogeneous specific binding assays described in the
technical and patent literature, the receptor or other assay reagent of the
specific binding reaction is often immobilized on a solid phase.
Immobilization of these reagents is required to separate the bound
components (for example analyte bound to the solid phase through a
receptor) from the unbound components.The various methods by which a receptor or other reagent can be
immobilized on a solid phase include adsorption, absorption or covalent
bonding. However, many of the solid phase supports used in such assays are
not inert, and may sequester proteins and other substances from the sample
by non-specific binding. Although glass is a relatively inert substrate,
generally it has been found to be unsatisfactory for use in solid phase binding
assays. See, for example U.S. Patent No. 3,790,653 for a discussion of
inadequacies of glass substrates.Recently, however, procedures have been described for
immobilizing an essentially soluble immunocomplex of a reagent and an
antiserum to the reagent on an inert glass fiber solid phase support. These
procedures are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,517,288.In these immunological immobilization procedures, soluble
immunocomplexes are prepared by combining
