<ABSTRACT>
In a toothed belt (1) having canvas (5) pasted on a meshing surface of a belt body, warp threads (9), which 
extend in the lengthwise direction of the toothed belt (1), in the canvas (5) consist of complex threads (15) each of 

which is composed of an elastic core thread (16), a fiber thread (17) of a high strength and a high thermal resistance 
wound around the core thread, and a regular synthetic fiber thread (18) wound around the fiber thread (17). The fiber 

thread (17) of a high strength and a high thermal resistance is restricted by the synthetic fiber thread (18) wound 
around the outer side thereof, and the fiber thread (17) does not therefore project in a greatly looped state, so that 

the thickness of the canvas (5) decreases. This enables the canvas (5) to have a high abrasion resistance and a high 
durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toothed belt for power transmission. Generally speaking, the toothed belt is constructed, as exemplified by a toothed belt 1 in Fig. 1, such 
that a rubber body 2 has teeth 3 formed on one surface thereof and tensile cords 4 buried therein in its 
longitudinal direction. A woven fabric 5 is adhered along the tooth-shaped contour to the meshing face of 
the toothed belt 1. When this toothed belt 1 is to be manufactured, on the outer circumference of a cylindrical mold 7 
formed on its surface with a female mold 6 for the teeth 3, as shown in Fig. 2, there is fitted the cylindrical 
woven fabric 5 which has been subjected to a treatment with an adhesive, e. g., RFL (i.e., Resorcinol-Formaldehyde-Latex). 
On this woven fabric 5, there are turned the tensile cords 4 which in turn are covered 
with rubber 8. When this rubber 8 is heated under pressure, it is forced through the gaps between the 
tensile cords 4 into the female mold 6, as shown in Fig. 3, so that it is vulcanized into the teeth 3. At this 
time, the woven fabric 5 is forced together with the rubber 8 into the female mold 6 to form a meshing face 
along the surfaces of the teeth 3. The woven fabric 5 is required to have initially a length substantially equal 
to the circumferential length of the toothed belt 1 and, when the teeth 3 are to be formed, a length 
contouring the teeth of the toothed belt 1. For this requirement to be met, it is necessary that the woven 
fabric 5 can be easily extended in the longitudinal direction of the toothed belt 1. In the prior art, as the yarns extensible in the longitudinal direction of the toothed belt 1 stretchable 
yarns have been used. These yarns will be called hereinafter the "longitudinal yarns 9" of the belt 
lengthwise direction, whereas the yarns to be combined with the longitudinal yarns 9 will be called the 
"transverse yarns 10". However, these "longitudinal yarns" and the "transverse yarns" are not necessarily 
coincident with the terminology "warp" and "weft", as used in the textile structure. These stretch yarns are exemplified by the woolly processed yarns of nylon or the like, as disclosed in 
JP, U, S 62-204059, U.S.P. 4,826,472 or European Patent No. 271,587. In recent years, toothed belts are 
used for driving the camshaft or balancer shaft of an automotive engine, for example. In accordance with 
the rise in the engine performance of recent years, the engine room is subject to high temperatures so that 
the toothed belt is required to have a sufficient
