<ABSTRACT>
An impact-resistant wrapping system includes at least 
one or two sheetlike wrapping body (1) or bodies having 

an elastic impact-resistant material (14) which is 
compressed and accommodated in a cavity (13) surrounded by 

flexible wall members (11) having gas-barrier properties, 
while the sheetlike wrapping body (1) is foldable to 

conform to the ceiling surface, the bottom surface and the 
side surfaces of a box, and there is an air valve (4), 

which is mounted in the flexible wall member (11), for 
ensuring/disrupting communications between the external 

space and the cavity (13) of sheetlike wrapping body (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact-resistant 
wrapping system and, more particularly, to improvements 
in impact-resistant wrapping performance in an impact-resistant 
wrapping system arranged in a box along the 
ceiling surface, the bottom surface and the side surfaces 
of the box to wrap an article which is accommodated in 
the box. For example, a prior art, impact-resistant wrapping system 
comprising flexible, synthetic, thin plates having a 
continuous three-dimensional pattern is known as an 
impact-resistant wrapping system, which is arranged in the 
box, for wrapping an article with a view to impact 
resistance. Single-layered or multilayered thin plates of this prior 
art system are arranged in a box along the bottom and 
side surfaces of the box except for its ceiling surface, 
an article is accommodated in the box, and a single-layered 
or multilayered thin plate is placed on the 
article inside the ceiling surface of the box to close the 
ceiling surface of the box. This impact-resistant 
wrapping system effects the impact-resistant wrapping of 
the article by the elastic force of the flexible three-dimensional 
pattern. Although this prior art system is interposed between the 
box and the article to hold the article with a certain 
elastic force, the play of the article inside the box 
cannot be perfectly eliminated, and the impact-resistant 
wrapping performance is consequently inadequate. As examples of the wrapping system for wrapping an article 
to be transported, an inflatable package has been 
proposed which is made up by an air bag having an impact-resistant  
 
space for accommodating the article in Japanese 
Patent Application Public Disclosure No. SHO 54-136985, No. 
SHO 63-502099 (corresponding to International Application No. 
WO 87/02012 (PCT/US86/01898)) and US Serial No. 5402892 
(08/113660). In the above-mentioned prior art systems, the article is 
shifted in the package according to the motion of the package, 
even if the package is inflated. US-A-5,129,519 discloses a wrapping system in accordance 
with the preamble of Claim 1. The present invention has been made in consideration of 
the conventional drawbacks described above, and its object is 
to provide an impact-resistance wrapping system having a high 
impact-resistant wrapping performance and being capable of 
properly fixing an article inside a box. The invention provides an impact-resistant wrapping 
system in accordance with Claim 1. According to the above impact-resistant wrapping system, 
the sheet-like

<CLAIMS>
Impact-resistant wrapping system comprising at least 
one sheet-like wrapping body (1) formed by flexible wall 

members (11) having gas-barrier properties to define a cavity 
(13) in which an elastic impact-resistant material (14) is 

accommodated in its compressed state, said sheet-like wrapping 
body (1) being foldable so as to conform to a ceiling surface, 

a bottom surface and side surfaces of a box, 
an air valve (4) being is mounted in said flexible wall member 

(11) for ensuring/disrupting communications between an external 
space and the cavity (13) of said sheet-like wrapping body (1), 

characterized in 
that a gas generating capsule (3) having at least one portion 

permeable only to a gas is accommodated in said cavity (13), 
and at least two types of materials for generating a gas to 

inflate said sheet-like wrapping body (1) upon being mixed 
with each other are separately sealed so as to be mixed with 

each other by depressing said capsule.
