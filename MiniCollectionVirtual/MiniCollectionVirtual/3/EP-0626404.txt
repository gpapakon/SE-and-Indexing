<ABSTRACT>
Block copolymers wherein one of the blocks is made 
from hard phase forming monomers and another of the blocks 

is made from soft phase forming monomers copolymerized with 
randomly intermingled units of other soft phase forming 

monomers. The copolymers are useful in forming surgical

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbable block
copolymers having one of the blocks predominantly hard
phase forming monomers and another of said blocks made from
randomly copolymerized soft phase forming monomers, and
more particularly to surgical articles made totally or in
part therefrom, including both monofilament and
multifilament sutures.Polymers and copolymers of, and surgical devices made
from lactide and/or glycolide and/or related compounds are
well-know. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 2,668,162,

(1981). Surgical devices prepared from copolymers containing
lactide or glycolide and trimethylene carbonate have been
described.U.S. Patent No. 4,429,080 describes glycolide end
blocks and glycolide trimethylene carbonate random
copolymer middle blocks. The block copolymers described in
the '080 patent contain no 1,4 dioxane-2-one.As another example, U.S. Patent No. 5,066,772
describes random copolymers of lactide and trimethylene
carbonate and triblock copolymers having lactide end blocks
and lactide-trimethylene carbonate random copolymer center
blocks. The block copolymers of the '772 patent do not
include a block which has predominantly glycolic acid ester
linkages.Block copolymers described in U.S. Patent 5,145,945 do
not include a block having random copolymers of
trimethylene carbonate and dioxanone nor do they include a
block which is predominantly glycolide. In addition, see
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,243,775; 4,300,565; 4,705,820;
4,891,263; 4,916,193; 4,902,203; 5,037,950, and 5,252,701.As described above bioabsorbable sutures are known in
the art. However, in the manufacture of sutures an
important characteristic of a suture is the
