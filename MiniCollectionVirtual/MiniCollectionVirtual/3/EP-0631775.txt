<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical tablet capable of releasing the active ingredients 
contained therein at subsequent times produced 
via
 the steps of: a) 
preparing a tablet consisting of three superposed layers, the upper 

layer containing an active ingredient, the intermediate layer not 
containing any active ingredient and forming a barrier-type layer, 

and the lower layer containing an active ingredient, said upper 
layer presenting a raised top, b) coating the tablet entirely with 

an impermeable polymeric film, and c) removing said raised top and 
thus allowing contact of the abraded upper layer surface with the 

environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The problem of optimizing the release of drugs from matrices to a
specific site and/or at a programmed rate is of consequence to
several fields of application, both in agriculture (e.g. use of
fertilizers and/or herbicides and/or selective pesticides) and in
human and animal therapy.In the aforesaid fields, very many are the research efforts made to
develop systems that utilize release of an active agent at a
constant rate, independently of the medium where the drug-containing
matrix or system is placed.In the biomedical field, with special regard to humans, in vitro
systems capable of releasing a drug at a constant rate and over a
scheduled period of time were extensively studied also with a view
to gaining information on a prospective identical or analogous
behaviour in vivo.Said systems are targeted for an in-vivo drug release according to
zero-order kinetics, which allows maintaining a constant plasmatic
level of the drug.Among said innovative pharmaceutical forms for oral administration,
mention may be made of the therapeutic systems denominated osmotic
pumps, usually known as OROS systems, as are disclosed in US patent
No. 4,160,020 (1979). The aforesaid embodiments have the undoubted advantage of allowing
a drastic simplification of the posologic schemes, which in many
cases envisage a single daily administration and, consequently,
result in a better patient's compliance therewith.The advantages of constant release pharmaceuticals are, however,
evident only when the drug plasmatic levels are within a precise
range for a long time: below said range the drug is inactive; above
it, untoward manifestations and side effects and/or toxic - even
extremely dangerous - phenomema may occur.Furthermore, in some pathological conditions and in some diseases
whose morbid manifestations are connected with circadian rhythms, it
would be advisable to administer pharmaceuticals capable of
releasing the active ingredient in sequential pulses to prevent the
onset of an exacerbated painful or morbid manifestation connected
with said circadian rhythms.Said type of administration may be required, e.g., to treat
rheumatic symptomatology and/or insomnia.As concerns rheumatic disease, it is known that the onset of
exacerbated pain in joints very frequently occurs 4 to 5 hours after
the beginning of sleep (that is, usually, in the dead of night) and,
therefore, a further drug administration is sometimes required.An analogous behaviour is shown by patients suffering from insomnia.
Said condition is often treated with drugs

<CLAIMS>
A pharmaceutical tablet, capable of releasing the drugs
at subsequent times, comprising three superposed layers, i.e.:


an upper layer containing an active ingredient, suitably
formulated so as to allow an immediate drug release;
an intermediate layer not containing any drug, which is formulated
so as to slowly interact with the dissolution medium;
a lower layer of the same formulation as the upper layer,
containing an identical or a different active ingredient,

said tablet being entirely coated - with the only exception of an
area of the upper side - with a polymeric film being impermeable to

water or aqueous fluids, consisting of a polymer either insoluble or
exhibiting a delayed solubility or a solubility depending on the pH

in water or aqueous fluids,

characterized in that said area

i) is smaller that the total area of the upper side of said upper
layer;
ii) is produced by abrasion of a raised top previously present in
said upper side of said upper layer.
The tablet according to claim 1 wherein said area comes from the
abrasion of a raised top having spherical form.
The tablet according to claim 1 wherein said area comes from the
abrasion of a raised top having a ring-shaped form.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said upper layer is 0.5
to 5 mm thick and contains 1 to 90% by wt. of active ingredient. 
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said intermediate layer
is 0.1 to 4.5 mm thick and contains 1 to 90% by wt. of gelable or

soluble or erodible polymeric substance.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said lower layer
contains an active ingredient identical with that contained in the

upper layer.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said lower layer
contains an active ingredient different from that contained in said

upper layer.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said polymeric coating
consists of water insoluble polymers selected among ethylcellulose,

acrylic and methacrylic polymers, copolymers of acrylic and
methacrylic acids, cellulose aceto-propionate.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said coating consists of
polymers whose solubility depends on the pH of the medium, selected

among cellulose aceto-phthalate, cellulose trimellitate, cellulose
acetate butyrate, copolymer of acrylic and methacrylic acids.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said polymeric coating,
in respect of the finished tablet's total weight, amounts to 0.2 to

20% by wt.
The tablet according to claim 1, wherein said partially coated
tablet is later entirely coated with a polymeric material soluble in

water and in aqueous fluids.
Process for the preparation of pharmaceutical tablets according
to claim 1 wherein: 


a) a tablet is prepared, consisting of said three superposed layers
in which the upper side of the upper layer has a raised portion with

respect to the remaining surface of the same side;
b) the tablet obtained in step a) is entirely coated with an
impermeable polymeric film; and
c) said raised portion is removed to allow contact of the
correspondent upper layer surface with the environment.
The process according to claim 12 wherein said raised portion is
removed by abrasion.
