<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new thermoprocessable tetrafluoroethylene 
copolymers particularly suitable for coating electric 

cables by melt extrusion. These copolymers consist of:

selected in particular classes of linear perfluoroalkylvinylethers 

containing one or more ether oxygen atoms, of 
perfluorovinylethers containing a cycle having 6 atoms 

and having one or more ether oxygen atoms, and of alpha-fluoroalkylethylenes; 
(c) tetrafluoroethylene, in such an amount that the sum of 
the percentages of the various monomers is equal to 100% 

by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new thermoprocessable 
tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) copolymers, particularly suitable 
for coating electric cables by melt extrusion. FEP copolymers (tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropene 
copolymers) are known, having a melting temperature of about 
260-265°C and endowed with relatively good mechanical 
properties up to a temperature of 200°C, as described for 
instance in US Patent 2,946,763. It is known that, for the 
processing of thermoprocessable polymers by extrusion, a low 
melt viscosity is required, i.e. a high melt flow index. A 
reduction of viscosity leads to a decay of the mechanical 
properties. To attenuate this effect, copolymers having a 
higher percentage of hexafluoropropene (HFP) are prepared. 
However, the use of a higher percentage of this comonomer 
implies a sharp reduction of the melting point and therefore 
a lower rating temperature. US Patent 4,029,868 illustrates another kind of FEP 
copolymers containing, besides TFE and HFP, from 0.5 to 3% by 
weight of a third monomer consisting of perfluoropropylvinylether  
 
or perfluoroethylvinylether. These terpolymers have a 
viscosity lower than the FEP copolymers containing only TFE 
and HFP. Nevertheless, mechanical properties at high temperature 
(200°C) remain still acceptable. According to the same patent 
above, perfluoromethylvinylether is not suitable as third 
monomer (see, in particular col. 3, lines 38-39 and 
comparative example A). US Patent 4,587,316 suggests the use, as third monomer, 
of perfluoroalkylvinylethers wherein the perfluoroalkyl group 
contains an even higher number of carbon atoms: from 4 to 10. Typically, a FEP terpolymer containing about 6% by mols 
of hexafluoropropene and about 0.4% by moles of perfluoropropylvinylether 
and having a melt index of about 18-20 shows 
the following properties: 
melting temperature: about 260°C; stress at break at 200°C: about 4 MPa; yield stress at 200°C: about 3 MPa; flex life: about 2,200; creep strain at 150°C for 10 hours with a 2.4 MPa load: 
about 11. The methods for determining these properties will be 
described hereinafter.  
 Generally, superior mechanical properties are obtained 
with TFE/perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymers, in particular 
with perfluoropropylvinylether, as described in US patent 
3,635,926, independently from the melt viscosity. The performances of this class of copolymers improve as 
the number of carbon atoms of the perfluoroalkylvinylether 
alkyl group increases, even though the reactivity decreases 
when
