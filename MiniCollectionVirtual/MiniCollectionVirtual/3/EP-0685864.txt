This invention relates to a thin and compact solenoid relay produced by employing semiconductor production 
technique. A flat sheet-like movable plate (5) and a torsion bar (6) for pivotally supporting the movable plate (5) 

are integrally formed on a silicon substrate (2) by employing semiconductor production technique. A flat surface coil 
(7) is disposed on the upper surface of the movable plate (5) ad a movable contact (9), on the lower surface side. 

Further, glass substrates (3) and (4) are disposed on the upper and lower surfaces of the silicon substrate (2), and a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planar type electromagnetic relay,
manufactured using semiconductor element manufacturing techniques, and imethod
of manufacturing thereof.With the development of microelectronics involving the high integration of
semiconductor devices, there is now a range of equipment which is both highly
functional as well as being miniaturized. Industrial robot type control systems using
a comparatively large amount of energy are also no exception. With this type of
control system, control of high energy is controlled by an extremely small amount of
energy, by incorporating microelectronics into the control equipment. As a result,
problems with erroneous operation due to noise and the like arise, so that the
demand for electromagnetic relays as final stage output devices is increasing.Conventional electromagnetic relays occupy large volume, incomparably
greater than that for semiconductor devices. Accordingly, in order to progress with
miniaturization of equipment, miniaturization of electromagnetic relays is required.Heretofore, the smallest standard wire wound type electromagnetic relay is
14mm long, 19mm wide and 5mm high (refer to Ultra Thin Signal Relays,
Matsushita Electric Publication, No. 35, pp27-31 (1987)). Moreover, recently, in order to further miniaturize an electromagnetic relay, a
planar type electromagnetic relay made using micro machining techniques has been
proposed ( refer to H Hosoka, H Kuwano and K. Yanagisawa, "Electromagnetic
Micro Relays: Concepts and Fundamental Characteristics", Proc. IEEE MENS
Workshop 93, (1993), pp.12-17).With this planar type relay also however since the coil is a conventional wire
wound type, miniaturization is limited.The present invention takes into consideration the above situation, with the
object of providing for further miniaturization of electromagnetic relays.Accordingly, the planar type electromagnetic relay of the present invention
comprises; a semiconductor substrate having a planar movable plate and a torsion
bar for axially supporting the movable plate so as to be swingable in a perpendicular
direction relative to the semiconductor substrate formed integrally therewith, a
planar coil for generating a magnetic field by means of an electric current, laid on an
upper face peripheral edge portion of the movable plate, and a movable contact
portion provided on a lower face thereof, and an insulating substrate having a fixed
contact portion provided on a lower face of the semiconductor substrate at a location
wherein the fixed
