<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates specifically to use of low cost thermoplastics such as PVC, and CPVC as high vacuum component material. We have discovered that when PVC or CPVC is exposed to high and ultra high vacuum pressures for a period of time, the outgas rate for these materials drops dramatically to levels that are well within required limits for high and ultra high vacuum applications, where vacuum pressures of 9x10-4 torr to 1x10-11 torr are required. Subsequently, it is a purpose of this invention through outgas reduction of the material with high and ultra high vacuum and or residual gas analysis determination of the outgas level to provide the user of the processed plastic components with a means (6) for determining the type and relative amount of contamination that the components would contribute to their vacuum process at the vacuum pressures that they intend to use.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLASTIC HIGH VACUUM PIPING COMPONENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention (Technical Field)The invention relates specifically to the discovery that certain low cost thermoplastics such as PVC and CPVC can be excellent materials for the construction of high and ultra high vacuum components. Prior art vacuum use of these materials has been restricted to vacuum pump exhausts lines and rough vacuum. We have conclusively determined through the use of residual gas analysis that the prior bias against the use of said materials in said service relates to surface impurities that are either a residue of manufacture, a non vacuum compatible lubricant or a joining adhesive, not continuous outgas or permeation of the PVC or CPVC plastic material itself. Subseguently, when these materials are exposed to high vacuum pressures, said surface impurities are gradually eliminated. These type of surface contamination would by it's presence render any material unsuitable for high and ultra high vacuum service. We have used an outgas reduction process method to demonstrate the capability of PVC and CPVC plastic compounds to be suitable for use in the construction of high and ultra high vacuum systems, where vacuum pressures from 9xl0"4 torr to lxlO"11 torr are required. We have also determined the relative purity level of the vacuum processed plastic components through the use of residual gas analysis. It should be noted that not all thermoplastic materials exhibitSUBS TUTE SHEET 

 adequate high and ultra high vacuum performance. It is expected that through the invention evaluation of thermoplastics that other cost effective materials may be found in addition to PVC and CPVC.Background ArtThe vacuum industry has considered low cost thermoplastics such as PVC, or CPVC to be unsuitable as a material of construction for high and ultra high vacuum components. This relates primarily to the perceived outgassing rate of such plastic materials and, secondly, to the perceived rate at which gases are able to permeate through the plastic material into the contained vacuum pressure space, "outgassing" is the tendency of materials to release gases over time. The rate at which materials give off gas, or outgas, is particularly a problem in high and ultra high vacuum applications where systems are almost exclusively fabricated from expensive polished stainless steel components which have low outgassing characteristics. Metal components for high and ultra high vacuum piping are often supplied with a helium leak rate
