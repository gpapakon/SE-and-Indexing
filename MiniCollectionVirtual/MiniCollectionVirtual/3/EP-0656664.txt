<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polycrystalline
silicon photoelectric conversion device and a process for its
production. More particularly it relates to a
polycrystalline silicon photoelectric conversion device
having a good energy conversion efficiency, and a
process for its production.As drive energy for various equipments and as
power sources systematically connected with commercial
power, solar cells serving as photoelectric
conversion device are widely researched.Solar cells make use of pn junctions in their
functional parts, and Si is commonly used as
semiconductors constituting the pn junctions. From
the viewpoint of efficiency for converting light
energy into electromotive force, it is preferred to
use monocrystalline silicon. From the viewpoint of
achievement of larger area and lower cost, amorphous
silicon types are considered advantageous. In recent
years, use of polycrystalline silicon is studied for 
the purpose of achieving a low cost comparable to
amorphous silicon types and a high energy conversion
efficiency comparable to monocrystalline silicon
types. In processes hitherto proposed, however, bulk
polycrystals are sliced into sheet members when used,
and hence it is difficult to make their thickness not
larger than 0.3 mm. Thus, they have a thickness
excessively large enough to absorb light in a
sufficient amount, resulting in no satisfactory
effective utilization of materials in this regard. In
other words, in order to make cost reduction, they
must be made to have much smaller thickness.Accordingly, it is attempted to form thin
films of polycrystalline silicon by using thin-film
forming techniques such as chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), according to which, however, crystal grain size
is equal to film thickness and can only be several-hundredths to
scores µm (microns). Thus, under existing
circumstances, such films have a low energy conversion
efficiency also when compared with the products
produced by slicing bulk polycrystalline silicon.Under such circumstances, it is also attempted
to irradiate polycrystalline silicon thin films with
laser light to melt them to effect recrystallization
so that the crystal grain size can be enlarged. This,
however, can achieve no satisfactory cost reduction 
and makes it difficult to carry out stable
manufacture.Meanwhile, it is proposed to form crystalline
silicon films on low-cost substrates by zone melting
recrystallization (ZMR) in a thickness large enough to
absorb sunlight (a Japanese language publication,
