<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric motor with screwless mounting of the frame, with a stator (3), a rotor and two end shields (9) which serve to guide the rotor and held together by bearing elements (11, 13) under tension. A simple and reliable mounting and removal of the stator (3) with the bearing elements (11, 13) and of the end shields (9) including the rotor is made possible in that the bearing elements (11, 13) which serve as spacing profiles have at their free ends securing tongues (83, 85) with locking noses which can be plugged through slots in the end shields (9) and engaged and locked under tension against the outsides (103) of the end shields (9) by means of the locking noses.
