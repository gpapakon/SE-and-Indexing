<ABSTRACT>
The machine comprises an identification device (1) 
for accepting suitable or ejecting unsuitable used 

cups, which on being accepted are conveyed through 
an inlet mouth (2) towards a bin (3), following a 

journey whereon are situated one or more 
operative groups (20, 30), through which the cups 

(17) pass and are treated such as to render them 
easier to contain.

<DESCRIPTION>
The ever-increasing use of automatic vending 
machines for hot and cold drinks using disposable 
cups made in plastic or cardboard or the like, as 
well as the use of such cups in public places for 
sale from kiosks, has created the need to consider 
carefully the question of collection and disposal 
of such containers after use for either recycling 
or destruction. Simply providing waste bins, or one waste bin for 
each kind of cup, is not sufficient, since the 
sense of responsibility of the general public 
cannot be trusted: cups would end up on the floor 
or even in the wrong bins. In the US-A-4 784 251 a deposit-type money-back system has been provided 
to overcome the above problem: on disposing 
correctly of a cup, a machine dispenses a small 
payment to a user. Since the principle of a money-back 
deposit has long been part of the public 
consciousness, especially as regards drink 
containers, this system has proved efficacious.  
 Such money-back machines, being dedicated to a specific 
kind of container, i.e. a cup dispensed by a vending 
machine situated right next to the money-back machine 
itself, have to be equipped with means for recognising the 
type of container a member of the public if trying to 
insert. Once this has been done, the container is conveyed 
internally towards a collecting bin inside the machine. The US-A-4 784 251 discloses a machine for collecting used 
cups with the features of the preamble part of claim 1. 
This machine comprises a housing with a means for 
receiving and supporting a container, identifying means 
disposed in the housing for identifying a received 
container in the receiving and supporting means, means for 
accepting a received container, dispensing means for 
dispensing consideration in response to an acceptance of 
a received container, means for moving the container to a 
predetermined position in the housing, first and second 
cutting means for cutting the container longitudinally 
into a plurality of elongated strips and for cutting the 
strips into a plurality of pieces, and means for storing 
the pieces received from the second cutting means. According to US-A-4 784 251 the second cutting means or 
granulator comprises the cutter blade as a part of the 
cylindrical shaft which is rotatably supported below the 
first cutting means which includes a pair of rotating 
drum-like shafts each of which has a plurality of axially 
spaced blades with integral angular shaped radially-extending 
teeth. The shafts are spaced relative to one 
another such
