<ABSTRACT>
A resuscitator device (10) for providing a 
physical shield between the rescuer and a victim 

requiring mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and comprising 
a flexible sheet (12) to conform to the contour of the 

face of the victim in the area around the mouth and 
nose. A mouth opening (18) is centrally formed in said 

sheet. A hollow rigid tube (20) surrounds and is 
secured to the periphery of said mouth opening (18) and 

depends downward therefrom for inserting into the mouth 
of the victim. A self closing, one-way valve (30) is 

contained in the tube (20), and includes a flexible, 
sleeve (32) having an air inlet open end in 

communication with the mouth opening (18) and an air 
outlet end (38) which is held normally closed by the 

action of a spring strip (34) secured to the sleeve 
(32) adjacent the outlet end (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices
for providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or
insufflation, and more specifically relates to devices
having a physical barrier or shield between the mouth
of the rescuer and the victim when providing mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to victims of suffocation,
asphyxiation, cardiac arrest, drowning and the like.Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is a first aid
technique and a preferred method for reviving a non-breathing
victim, when life or death may be determined
from actions taken within seconds, by rapidly
delivering large volumes of exhaled air under pressure
to inflate the lungs and reactivate the normal
breathing process. In this method, the victim is
placed on his or her back, the mouth is opened to check
and clear any airway obstruction and making sure the
tongue is not lodged in the passageway to be used and
is positioned in the lower cavity inside the mouth, the
chin is pulled forward, the head is tilted backward,
the nose or nostrils are pinched closed, then an air
tight seal is made with the lips of the rescuer and the
victim, and the rescuer commences to evenly exhale a
deep breath under pressure into the victim's mouth; and
then the lip seal is broken to enable another deep
breath to be taken and the nose air pathways are opened
in the event of any exhaling by the victim; and the
process is repeated, until hopefully, the victim is
able to exhale and to finally inhale unaided by the
rescuer.In the past, possible rescuers were reluctant
to engage in mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for fear of
contracting disease or illness from such contact with
the victim. Generally, however, the person would
assume the risk when there was no other alternative for 
saving the life of the victim. The individual attitude
is considerably different today, for there is a mortal
fear, which may or may not have any basis in fact, that
any close or intimate contact could result in being
stricken with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome
("AIDS") virus, particularly if the victim is suspected
of being a drug user or a homosexual. Presently there
is no known cure and only certain death after a person
contracts the AIDS virus, and the number of reported
AIDS cases is dramatically increasing throughout the
world. In view of this, people will avoid or just
refuse to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without any
safeguard for shielding against direct and intimate
contact. The subject invention provides such
protection for the person giving mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation or practicing this
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mouth to mouth resuscitator device (10) for
use by a rescuer for resuscitating a victim, comprising


a sheet (12) of flexible material having a
top side (16) for contacting the rescuer and a bottom

side (14) for contacting the victim, said sheet having
a mouth opening (18) formed therein at substantially

the center thereof,
a hollow rigid tube (20) insertible in the
victim's mouth and having an inner end (22) and an

outer end (26), the inner end (22) of said tube being
secured to the periphery of said mouth opening (18) and

extending downwardly therefrom, and
a one-way valve (30) positioned
inside said tube

to prevent air entering the mouth of
the victim and preventing back flow of air and/or

liquid flowing from the victim to the rescuer,
characterized in that said valve (30) is a self closing valve

normally having a closed condition,
said

valve having an open condition when the rescuer exhales
air under pressure into said valve (30) via said mouth

opening (18) for discharging air into the mouth of the
victim, and
means formed in the bottom of said sheet (12) are provided
for allowing air exhaled by said victim to flow to the

outside.
The device of Claim 1 including a safeguard
device (84) attached to the outer end of said tube (20)

to provide a blocking surface without affecting the
desired air discharge into the mouth of the victim.
The device of Claim 2, wherein said safeguard
device (84) comprises a plurality of bars (86, 88) 

extending across the outer end (26) of said tube (20).
The device of Claim 3, wherein one bar is a
longitudinal bar (86) extending across the outer end of

the tube (20) and attached thereto, and a plurality of
spaced apart transverse bars (88) are attached to said

longitudinal bar and to opposite sides of said outer
end (26) of the tube.
The device of Claim 4, wherein notches (90)
are formed at said outer end (26) to receive opposite

ends of said longitudinal and transverse bars (86, 88).
The device of Claim 1, wherein said means
includes:


a patch (66) with an irregular surface formed
on said bottom side (14) of said sheet (12) for

positioning adjacent the nose of the victim when the
device is in an operative position, for allowing air

flow from said nose.
The device of Claim 6, wherein said irregular
surface includes a plurality of spaced apart bumps

(68).
The device of Claim 1, wherein said means
includes:


at least one air pathway (80,81) extending
from adjacent said mouth opening (18) on the bottom

side (14) of the sheet to an outer edge of the sheet.
The device of Claim 8, wherein said pathways
include a plurality of grooves (70, 74) formed in the

bottom side (14) of the sheet.
The device of Claim 1, wherein said means
includes:


a first plurality of grooves (74) formed in
said bottom side (14) of said sheet (12) and extending

outward from adjacent said mouth opening (18) to an 
outer edge (78) of the sheet operatively positioned

adjacent the right cheek of the victim, and
a second plurality of grooves (70) formed in
said bottom side (14) of said sheet and extending

outward from adjacent said mouth opening (18) to the
opposite outer edge (70) of the sheet (12) operatively

positioned adjacent the left cheek of the victim.
The device of Claim 1, including:

a rigid flange (28) extending around said
inner end (22) of the tube (20) integrally formed

thereto, said flange (28) being secured to said sheet
(12) around the periphery of said mouth opening (18).
The device of Claim 11, wherein said flange
(28) is attached to the top side (16) of the sheet (12)

and said tube (20) passes through said mouth opening
(18) to extend downwards from said bottom side (14) of

said sheet.
The device of Claim 11, wherein said flange
(28) is dimensioned to provide a bracing surface for

the inner portions of the upper and lower lips of the
rescuer as the lips of the rescuer are pressed against

the lips of the victim when said sheet (12) is
therebetween for providing an air seal between said

lips.
The device of Claim 1, wherein said mouth
opening (18) is oval and the inner end (22) of the tube

(20) is oval, said inner end (22) of the tube forcing
the lips of the victim slightly apart to enable the

lips of the rescuer to easily make a tight air seal
with the lips of the victim when said sheet (12) is

therebetween.
