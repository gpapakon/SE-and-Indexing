<ABSTRACT>
A cleaner composition for removing graffiti including ink, marking pen marks and paint from a variety of substrates or surfaces. The base composition for all five embodiments comprises N-methylpyrrolidone, propylene carbonate, isocetyl alcohol, an ingredient selected from the group consisting of dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate and dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate, a thickening agent and a surfactant. Each species or embodiment varies the range of these ingredients and some embodiments include other ingredients, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, a tertiary amine and mineral oil and lavender oil. Each embodiment is directed to a different type substrate or surface to maximize the removal of graffiti on that surface without any deleterious effects to that surface.

TITLE: CLEANER COMPOSITIONSRELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/694,463, filed May 11, 1991, which in turn is a continuation of application Serial No. 07/400,564, filed August 30, 1989, now U.S. Patent No. 5,024,780, which issued June 18, 1991, and this application is also a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/423,258, filed October 18, 1989.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to cleaner compositions. More particularly, the present invention relates to such cleaner compositions that 
remove graffiti including conventional graffiti, such as oil based paints including enamels, epoxies, lacquers and urethanes, ink, marking pen marks, paint, lipstick, shoe polish and nail polish from a variety of surfaces without damage to the protective coat on the surface and without altering the surface or causing damage to any area in close proximity thereto. Also, the present invention relates to cleaner compositions that have very low evaporation rate and very high flash point.The present invention includes five particular cleaner compositions each for different kinds of surface. Each of the five compositions include certain active ingredients and additives, however the range of the active ingredients and the use of additional ingredients varies in each composition.In recent years, there has been an increase concern over the rapidly growing problem of graffiti. In modern times, the term graffiti has come to acquire a meaning that differs substantially from it's historical meaning. Specifically, the modern observer views graffiti not as an art form, but rather, as a form of destruction and vandalism. 

 The application of graffiti has become most prevalent in institutions, such as, schools, school buses, public and private buildings, automobiles, trucks, trains, cars and rest rooms that are available to the public at large. Graffiti is even more problematic in open areas, such as, support walls and piers, bridges, retaining walls, sound barriers, the exterior walls of buildings and various structures in parks, which incidentally were put there in the first place to cosmetiÏƒally improve the parks and the like.The methods for the removal of graffiti, that for the most part are cost prohibitive, have included, sandblasting, hydrosanding and hydroblasting the surfaces on which the graffiti appears. These methods often involve a subsequent re-painting of the surface to restore its aesthetically
