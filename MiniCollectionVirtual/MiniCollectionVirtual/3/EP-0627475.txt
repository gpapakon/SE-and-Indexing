<ABSTRACT>
A storage stable anaerobic composition which does not require 
constant aeration with a viscosity between 50,000 to 5,000,000 mPa.s 

and a volume expansion of between about 1 to 20% due to the creation 
within the composition by aeration of stable, uniform, microcellular 

foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acrylate based anaerobic curing compositions
which are storage stable. Anaerobic curing compositions, if
continually exposed to an adequate supply of air or oxygen, remain in
an uncured state over long periods of time. However, once the air or
oxygen is excluded, these compositions rapidly cure. Depending on
the formulation of the compositions, they may be used as anaerobic
adhesives or anaerobic sealants.Anaerobic curing compositions which can be used as adhesives or
sealants are well known in the art. Typical anaerobic curing compositions
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,895,950 (Krieble),
3,043,820 (Krieble) and 3,218,305 (Krieble).The characteristic of premature polymerization in oxygen-free
environments can cause problems in packaging anaerobic curing compositions.
At present, one option has been to package anaerobic curing
compositions in air permeable containers with large amounts of air
trapped in the package. For example, to package one liter of
product, a two liter container is used. This is both expensive and
ecologically wasteful.Another option has been to design packages to maximize the
surface area between the anaerobic composition and the available air
space. For example, currently packaging is done in long, thin, air 
permeable cartridges. This allows all areas of the product to be exposed to air.
However, packages of such design can only hold small quantities of product and are not
feasible for packaging bulk amounts.Several solutions have been proposed to keep these anaerobically curing
compositions from prematurely polymerizing. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 2,628,178
discloses bubbling air through the composition. The problem is that this aeration would
have to be continuous, and is therefore not feasible for packaging purposes. In U.S.
Patent No. 3,795,641, aeration was done in the presence of tertiary amines and
compounds containing an imido group. It is believed that these compounds play a
catalytic role in creating hydroperoxy sites along the backbone of the polyethylene glycol
dimethacrylate. It is also believed that the aeration actually increases the level of
dissolved oxygen in the composition. To achieve suitable shelf life, aeration times of at
least 2 to 4 days were necessary.In view of the foregoing, there is a continuing need in the anaerobic curing
composition art for rapid and inexpensive methods to prevent premature polymerization.
Also, there is a need for being able to package anaerobic compositions in bulk containers
such as 5 liter
