<ABSTRACT>
Described is a plastic encapsulated electronic device having an 
integrated circuit unit (13), a lead frame (14) and a plastic material 

(15) encapsulating the IC unit (13) 
and portions of the leads into a sealed package. Each of the leads 

includes an inner 
portion adjacent the IC unit, an outer portion laying in a different 

plane than the 
inner portion, and a central portion interconnecting the inner and the 

outer portions. 
The plastic enclosure (15) is so formed that the outer portion of each 

lead, except for its 
lowermost flat surface and a short outermost section, is embedded in 

the plastic 
material. The bottom surface of the plastic enclosure is substantially 

coplanar with 
the lowermost flat surface of each lead. The short outermost portion 

(18) of the outer 
lead portion extends beyond the plastic material for testing purposes. 

This 
arrangement provides for a robust encapsulation of the leads avoiding 

the prior 
problems of the prior art. Additionally, this device is especially 

useful for attaching 
the device to an interconnecting board (11) by means of conductive 

adhesives (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns plastic encapsulated electronic devices, such as
integrated circuits and hybrid integrated circuits.Electronic devices, such as integrated circuit devices having an
integrated circuit unit and a lead frame which are sealed within a protective
enclosure, find wide use in products including consumer electronics, household
appliances, computers, automobiles, robotics, telecommunications, and military
equipment. The IC unit may be an integrated circuit on a chip or it may be a
module, a hybrid integrated circuit (HIC) having one or more chips, other electronic
components and circuitry on a plastic or ceramic support base. The IC devices are
sealed within an enclosure such as a metal cap, ceramic shell, or plastic molding in
order to protect the device from the environment, including mechanical and chemical
damage. Molded plastic packaging of the electronic devices plays a major role in the
microelectronics industry. Plastic packages are less expensive than other types of
packaging options, such as ceramic and/or metal packaging, and provide
performance and reliability that make them acceptable in a major fraction of
worldwide electronic device packaging. A means to electrically interconnect the IC
device to circuitry external of the package conventionally takes the form of a lead
frame. The lead frame is formed from an electrically conductive material, such as
copper alloy or an iron-nickel alloy, by stamping or etching a metal blank into a
plurality of lead fingers defining a central area in which the IC unit is mounted. The
central area may include a paddle on which the IC unit is mounted, or may include
an aperture in which the electronic device is mounted. Contact pads on an IC unit
are typically connected to the leads of the lead frame by means of wires or tapes.
Alternatively, ends of the leads may be soldered or conductive adhesive may be used
to contact the pads.After the IC unit is electrically connected to the leads of the lead frame,
the assembly is encapsulated in a plastic molding compound with end portions of
leads projecting beyond the edge of the encapsulant. The ends of the leads are then
formed into different configurations. In FIGs. 4, 5 and 6 are shown typical prior art
devices 40, 50 and 60, respectively, with leads having so-called "gull wing", "J" or
"butt"-configuration, respectively, for surface mounting the devices onto circuit
boards. The packages may be dual-in-line package (DIP) and quad (or chip
carrier) package. In the DIP, leads extend in straight

A plastic molded circuit package (10) having an integrated circuit (IC)
unit (13), a plurality of leads (14) projecting away from the IC unit (13), and plastic

material (15) encapsulating the IC unit (13) and portions of the leads (14) and forming a
sealed package, wherein each of said leads (14) has an inner section immediately

adjacent to and projecting away from the IC unit (13), a flat outer section (17) for
electrical connection to outside contacts (12), said outer section (17) laying in a different

plane than the inner section, and a central section interconnecting to the inner and the
outer sections, said inner and central sections being completely enclosed in the plastic

said electrical connection, the outer conductive surface (20) laying in a plane which is
essentially coplanar with a bottom surface of the molded package (10), wherein an

outermost end section (18) of each lead (14) forms an extension of the outer section
(17), and projects from the plastic material (15),

surface of the molded package (10) that opposes said bottom surface.
An interconnection board (11) having contacts (12) thereon and a
circuit package (10) according to claim 1 mounted thereon, said conductive outer

surface (20) of each lead (14) being secured in an electrical connection to one of the
contacts (12) on the interconnection board (11).
