<ABSTRACT>
In a printing sheet making and printing system 
applicable to for example an electronic gravure printing 

system a printing sheet is sheathed in a printing sheet 
jacket to prevent the adhesion of dust and the occurrence 

of scratching on its surface and the feeding and ejection 
of the printing sheet to and from the cylinders of a 

printing sheet making machine and a printing machine is 
completely automated so that an operator can run the 

system without ever directly touching the printing sheet. 
A printing sheet, a printing sheet jacket, and devices for 

pulling the jacket and the printing sheet into a printing 
sheet making machine or a printing machine and removing 

the printing sheet from the jacket and winding and 
clamping it onto a cylinder for engraving of the printing 

sheet or printing with it and returning it to the jacket 
and ejecting the jacket and the printing sheet inside it 

from the machine after the engraving or printing all in a 
completely automated fashion are disclosed. The 

interchangeability of the printing sheets with respect to 
the cylinders is extremely good and consequently when 

image data such as a photograph is engraved colour by 
colour on a plurality of printing sheets and multicolour 

overprinting is carried out colour non-alignment, colour 
blurring, image distortion and scumming and the like do 

not readily occur and high image quality, fine printing 
can be performed. The invention facilitates development 

toward a completely automated electronic gravure printing 
system which can be run unmanned.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing sheet making and
printing apparatus most suitable for application to for
example an electronic gravure printing system.Conventionally, for example as shown in
GB-A-2,223,984, upon which the precharacterising portions
of appended claims 1, 2, 25 and 26 are based, in an
electronic gravure printing system, which is an example,
of an intaglio printing system, a printing sheet of
approximately 200 microns in thickness made of a
thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene resin has been used.In an engraving step carried out by a printing sheet
making machine, this printing sheet is wound onto the
periphery of a cylinder and while the cylinder is rotated at
thigh speed image data in the form of relief is engraved in
the surface of the printing sheet by the laser beam of a
semiconductor laser cutting into the printing sheet as the
laser is reciprocated in the direction of the axis of the
cylinder.Then, in a printing step carried out by a printing
machine, the printing sheet engraved in the foregoing
engraving step is again wound onto the periphery of a
cylinder. While the cylinder is rotated at high speed, ink
is coated by an ink roller onto the image data in the form of 
relief in the printing sheet; paper or the like, the matter
to be printed, is pressed by a pressure roller against the
surface of the printing sheet while being fed past it at high
speed, and an image such as a photograph or the like is
printed at high speed on the surface of the paper.In this step, in the case of color printing, printing
sheet making is performed separately for each of a number of
colors such as cyan, magenta, yellow and black, and
multicolor overprinting with cyan, magenta, yellow and black
inks is carried out.With such an electronic gravure printing system, because
it is possible to highly precisely engrave image data in the
form of relief in the surface of the printing sheet in the
order of submicrons using a laser beam emitted by a
semiconductor laser, images such as photographs can be
printed with extremely high precision.However, in conventional electronic gravure printing
systems, the printing sheet has been wound onto the periphery
of the cylinder and fixed there with screws by hand.As a result, in conventional electronic gravure printing
systems, there has been the problem that the work of winding
the printing sheet onto the periphery of the cylinder is
tiresome and the operatability of the printing sheet making
and printing work is low.Also, in systems wherein the printing sheet is
