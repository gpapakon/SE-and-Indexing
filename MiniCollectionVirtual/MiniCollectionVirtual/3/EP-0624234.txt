<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID OUTLET SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a fluid outlet system for use in situations requiring ease of modification to meet changing needs, both in terms of the types of fluids supplied and the locations at which such fluids are supplied. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system for providing medical fluids, such as oxygen, medical air and vacuum, in hospital settings where it is often desirable to change the types of fluids supplied and the locations at which such fluids are supplied.Attempts have been made to provide fluid outlet systems with the requisite adaptability necessary for modern hospital administration. These attempts are described in a number of issued patents including the following:U.S. Patent No. 4,905,433 discloses a hospital headwall system having raceways divided into compartments some of which can be used for carrying medical gas pipes. Detachable covers provide access to the various compartments while enclosing the raceways.U.S. Patent No. 4,646,211 discloses a service outlet wall system having a fluid service outlet which is movable along a linear rail so as to permit placement of the service outlet at different positions along the rail. 

In the /211 system, the service outlet has to be connected to a flexible hose maintained behind the service outlet wall.U.S. Patent No. 4,498,693 discloses a rail system with passageways for conducting fluid therethrough. Couplings provide access to the passageways and also provide means for connecting the passageways together.U.S. Patent No. 4,305,430 discloses a module with passageways for conducting fluids therethrough. "VÎ¹r-shaped grooves along the surface of the module indicate the location of the different passageways. A user taps into the desired passageway by drilling rearwardly into the module at a location indicated by a particular groove.The prior art systems have many disadvantages. In particular, changing the configuration of any of the prior art systems, i.e., adding or removing a gas service, would require the services of maintenance personnel.Additionally, each prior art system has a gas coupler or other gas supply means which extends horizontally several inches beyond the surface to which the system is installed. In a hospital room, this poses a potential breakage problem as beds are raised or as equipment is wheeled around.In systems in which fluid is provided via a manifold arrangement configured with DISS (Diameter Indexed Safety System) check valves, the flow to the

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
The cited Szohatzky reference fails to disclose or suggest the step of "supplying at least two . . . gases at each of a plurality of locations," as specifically recited in claim 1. Szohatzky discloses a system for supplying a plurality of gases, such as oxygen and anesthetics. But Szohatzky fails to suggest supplying any one of the gases at more than one location. "[SÏupplying at least two . . . gases at each of a plurality of locations" is an important feature of the invention recited in claims 1 and 2. Szohatzky fails to disclose or suggest this feature.
According to claim 3, "all of said . . . fluids are supplied to all of said . . . locations" (claim 3, last paragraph). Szohatzky clearly fails to disclose or suggest this specific feature of the claimed invention. Therefore, claim 3 is believed to be allowed over Szohatzky.
Claim 9 requires a "plurality of valves including a valve for each of said plurality of fluids at each of said plurality of locations". Szohatzky discloses no more than one valve for each supplied fluid.
Cranage discloses a system for supplying a plurality of gases, such as oxygen and vacuum. But Cranage fails to suggest supplying any one of the gases at more than one location. Accordingly, the claims are believed to be allowable over Cranage.
