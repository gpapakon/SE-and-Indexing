<ABSTRACT>
An ornament of the present invention is composed 
of a light transmission material having a plurality of 

facets (21), and a plurality of fine grooves (23) are formed on 
these facets, thereby to increase brilliancy, dispersion 

and scintillation effects of rays of light so as to 
heighten the ornamental property.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ornament
according to the preamble portion of claim 1.A diamond is one of typical jewelry. The reason
why the diamond holds the highest position as jewelry is
due to a fact that the diamond itself has excellent
features such as transparency and a high refractive index,
but has also deep relevancy with a method of cutting.
Because, the reflected quantity of light and the refraction
state of light varies delicately depending on the
method of cutting. A typical method of cutting is
brilliant-cut.This method of cutting is presently known as a
method of showing splendid beauty of a diamond most
eminently as compared with all the other methods of
cutting such as square-cut and emerald-cut.The beauty of a brilliant-cut diamond first
exists in the large quantity of total reflection. Due to
a high refractive index, the total reflection area is wide
and total reflection quantity is large. Hence, a diamond
shines as everyone knows. This phenomenon is called
brilliancy. Next, the total reflection light gives rise
to dispersion due to the difference of the refractive
index in accordance with oscillation frequencies of
respective colors and changes in seven colors. This
rainbow in seven colors is called the fire. Furthermore,
the light totally reflected from facet planes moves while
glittering every time the diamond moves or a watcher moves
its eyes. This phenomenon is called scintillation. By
means of brilliant-cut, these brilliancy, dispersion and 
scintillation are brought about efficiently, which
constitutes a strong reason for the beauty of a diamond.As a prior art for improving the beauty, there
is the Republic of South Africa Patent Application Number
7018135 (corresponding to Japanese Patent Provisional
Publication Number 47-11241) applied on December 1, 1970,
"A Cut Diamond and A Cut Method thereof". In this
invention, a square-cut method is adopted from a viewpoint
of improvement of raw material yield of rough diamond.Further, there is U.S. Patent Application Number
690401 applied on May 27, 1976 (corresponding to Japanese
Patent Provisional Publication Number 52-147170) "Cut
Jewel Made Brilliant". This invention relates to a
hybrid-cut method provided with advantages of both the
square-cut method having high raw material yield of rough
diamond and the brilliant-cut method superior in brilliancy
of a diamond.Furthermore, there is Patent Application Number
254360 applied on September 29, 1989 (Laid-Open Number 3-115582)
"Method of Coating Precious Metals on Diamond".

<CLAIMS>
An ornament of a light transmissive material having a
plurality of cut facets, wherein at least one of said

cut facets has a plurality of fine grooves (29) used as
diffraction grating, said plurality of fine grooves (29)

being spaced over the total surface of said one facet
with a substantially equal spacing (25), characterized

in that said spacing (25) is within 0.1 microns to 1000
microns suitable for the diffraction of visible light

entering the ornament through said one facet to form a
rainbow of seven colors within said ornament and thereby

enhance the appearance of the ornament, and in that said
one facet is divided into a plurality of areas where the

fine grooves (29) in one area of said one facet have a
different orientation than the fine grooves (29) in

other areas of said one facet adjoining said one area.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said light
transmissive material is a material selected from the

group consisting of a diamond, glass, plastic and a
cubic zirconia.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said spacing
(25) is approximately 2.5 microns.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein the width (27)
of each of said plurality of fine grooves (29) is

approximately 2.5 microns.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said fine
grooves (29) are parallel lines. 
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said fine
grooves (29) are formed as concentric circles.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said fine
grooves (29) form a wave form pattern.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said fine
grooves (29) form a pattern of parallel lines,

concentric circles or waveforms.
An ornament according to claim 1, wherein said areas of
said one facet extend radically outward from the center

of said one facet.
