<ABSTRACT>
In the production of emulsion concrete to be laid out as a road material it is customary that the applied stone fractions are mixed together with a binder, which is a bitumen emulsion based on a relatively low viscid bitumen, as the material would otherwise be very difficult to shape by the laying operation. According to the invention the coarse stone fraction is pretreated with a rapid breaking emulsion based on high viscid bitumen, and only thereafter the fine stone fraction with low viscid binder is added. Thereby it is possible to maintain a good shapeability of the material and yet obtain a significantly improved bonding of or in the laid out material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing an emulsion- or asphalt-concrete for use as a
road material.It is a well known sight that asphalt concrete is
laid out in a smoking hot condition, whereby it is
possible to keep the mixture of stones and bitumen
suitably shapable for an even laying-out and
compression, just as the mixture may then have a large
content of high viscid bitumen, thereby ensuring a good
bonding and yet a certain, desired resiliency in the
laid-out material, when its temperature decreases to
ambient temperature. Only it is very energy consuming to
effect the associated heating of the material.On this background has been developed a 'cold'
technique (see e.g. US-A-4 978 393), which may well have certain drawbacks or
limitations, but nevertheless is considered advantageous
in that the heating can be avoided. The technique is
based on the use of a bitumen emulsion in admixture with
a graded stone material. An aqueous bitumen emulsion has
no particular bonding ability of its own, but in time a
so-called 'breaking' of the emulsion occurs, whereby the
emulgated bitumen fractions float together and the water
is segregated, such that the bitumen may thereafter act
as a binding agent that can stick to the stone surfaces
and bond these together. By means of different additives
it is possible to control rather accurately when this
breaking should take place after the mixing operation.
It is achievable, therefore, that the mixture can be
prepared and transported to the laying area and be
laid-out therein prior to the breaking having proceeded
to the point where the material will not thereafter be 
suitably easily shapeable.If the emulsion is or has not broken almost as soon
as it has been laid out, one problem among others will
be that in case of rain after the laying out a more or
less extensive washing out of the emulsion may take
place, this of course being highly unlucky or in the
worst case even fatal for the work.It is well known, therefore, that the breaking
should be adjusted so as to have proceeded widely
already at the time of the laying out, even though this
will create the problem that it is not possible to use
any particularly hard binding bitumen in the emulsion.
If the breaking of an emulsion with such a hard or high
viscid bitumen has proceeded widely just before the
laying out, it will be impossible to effect the laying
work in an easy and orderly manner under 'cold'
conditions, because the material will then be so
strongly bonded together that it cannot be

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing an emulsion concrete or asphalt
concrete to be laid out as a road material, comprising the

following steps:

selecting a coarse stone fraction and a fine stone
fraction,
coating the coarse stone fraction with a first bitumen
of a relatively high viscosity in the range of 5000-75.000

mm
2
/sec at 60°C, by one of the steps a) or b) :

a) mixing the coarse stone fraction with a first bitumen
emulsion based on said high viscid first bitumen and prepared

for breaking not later than by a following addition of the
fine stone fraction,
b) mixing the coarse stone fraction in heated condition
with said high viscid first bitumen also in a heated

condition,
adding to that mixture said fine stone fraction and a
second bitumen of a relatively low viscosity being lower than

5000 mm
2
/sec at 60°C, and substantially lower than the
viscosity of said first bitumen, by one of the steps c) or d) :


c) mixing the fine stone fraction, integrated in the
mixing with the coarse stone fraction, with a second bitumen

emulsion based on said low viscid second bitumen and prepared
for breaking before a following laying out of the concrete

material,
d) mixing the fine stone fraction, integrated in the
mixing with the coarse stone fraction, with said low viscid

second bitumen in a cold or heated condition, yet when used
in combination with the above step b) being heated to a

temperature below the temperature used in that step b),
mixing all said ingredients for effectively preventing
short term clogging of the coarse stone fraction, and
bringing out the mixed material prior to the same
setting by migration of the first and second bitumen.
A method according to claim 1, in which the first
bitumen for the coarse stone fraction is of a

viscosity of at least 20.000 mm
2
/sec at 60°C. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the second
bitumen for use in said step d) is a bitumen of a viscosity

in the range of 1500-2000 mm
2
/sec at 60°C.
A method according to claim 1, in which said step a)
is effected such that the breaking of the first bitumen

emulsion takes place as soon as the coarse stones are fully
coated with the emulsion.
A method according to claim 1, whereby the second
bitumen emulsion is prepared so as to break shortly after or

even prior to the mixed material leaving the mixing station,
for urgent use of the mixture.
An emulsion concrete or asphalt concrete prepared in
accordance with the method of claim 1, exhibiting a resulting

bitumen viscosity in the range of 10000-30000 mm

/sec. at 60°C.
