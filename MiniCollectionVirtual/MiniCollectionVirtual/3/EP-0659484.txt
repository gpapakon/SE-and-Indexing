<ABSTRACT>
With the inventive high-speed fine pulvelizer, wherein a 
fixed top grindstone (1) is mounted in a pulverizing chamber with 

reduced pressure-tolerable mechanism, a rotating bottom 
grindstone (2) is arranged in opposition thereto and mounted 

firmly to a rotating disk with a plurality of ejection wings (4) 
for reduced pressure disposed around it, and an intensive 

reduced-pressure jet stream is caused by the high-speed 
revolution of rotating bottom grindstone (2) to suck air from 

central opening of fixed grindstone (1), thereby forcedly passing 
the pulverizing raw material fed from said opening through the 

clearance between both grindstones at high speed while 
whirling it to pulverize finely, the pulverizing raw material 

can be pulverized finely at ambient temperature without 
raising temperature, allowing to convert foods etc. to powder 

without thermal transmutation. Further, if need be, the 
invention provides an equipment for producing finely 

pulverized powder, comprising such high-speed fine pulverizer 

and an air classifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-speed finely 
pulverizing method employed a function for generating reduced 
pressure jet stream and an equipment therefor. The conventional pulverizer adopting mill principle 
generates heat due to the thermal conversion of energies such 
as those of compression, shear and rolling friction generating 
in the pulverizing process, when finely pulverizing materials 
containing high lipid, high moisture, high protein, or high 
amount of saccharide or special enzyme, resulting in very 
difficult fine pulverization due to sticking caused by 
bleeding of lipid, adherence caused by moisture, burning 
caused by oxidizing metamorphosis etc., film formation, and 
the like. Moreover, since the heat generation is proportional to 
the number of revolutions, low speed is oriented without 
exception in order to suppress the heat generation. Showing a typical example using stone mortar, it runs at 
a number of revolutions of 156 rpm for traditional goods such 
as ground tea (Uji Tea Research Laboratory), leading to 
extremely low capacity (40 g - 100 g/h). Hence, 1,000 stone 
mortars are working at same factory. Furthermore, there is a compressive pulverization system 
using rolls as a low-speed fine pulverizer. This is superior 
for the pulverization at ambient temperature, but the capacity  
 
is very low because of low speed, hence the operation was 
connected with increased cost and was difficult economically. Now, a lot of powder-producing machines have been used so 
far in various industrial sectors. As a representative of 
super colloid mill being one example thereamong, there is Mass 
Colloider (trade name) that efficiently provides super fine 
powder of hard pulverizing materials. This is constituted 
with a fixed top grindstone having flat grinding area at outer 
circumference, the width thereof being adjustable freely, and 
a rotating bottom grindstone having flat grinding area 
similarly at outer circumference and being rotatable at high 
speed, arranged so that their flat grinding areas are in 
opposition one another, and the pulverizing material fed 
between these grindstones from central opening of fixed 
grindstone is super finely pulverized by means of overall 
actions of contrifugal force, impact grinding force, shear 
force, etc. caused between said opposed flat grinding areas. The life of such super colloid mail and Mass Colloider 
lies in the built-in grindstones. In particular, with hard pulverizing materials, that is, 
materials containing high lipid, high
