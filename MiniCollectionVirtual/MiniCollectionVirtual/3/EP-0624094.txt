<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of fibroblast growth factor and its derivatives as neuroprotective agents against the damage produced by ischaemia and cerebral reperfusion, and as agents with a neuromodulatory effect on motor activity, and of all compounds related thereto, in those clinical situations which require neuronal protection following cerebral or carotid ischaemia. The pharmacological use of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor and all compounds relating thereto is also justified in clinical situations which require a decrease in agitation and aggressiveness.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTORS AS NEUROPROTECTIVE AND NEURO ODULATORY AGENTSThe present invention relates to the use of polypeptides belonging to the family of fibroblast growth factors (acidic and basic and the non-mitogenic form of acidic FGF), as well as their derivatives, as substances that protect the nervous tissue following episodes of transient cerebral ischaemia followed by reperfusion, as well as to their use as substances with a neu- s romodulatory effect on motor activity.Spanish Patent Application No. P9102007, submitted on 6th September 1991 in the name of the same applicant, covers the use of fibroblast growth factors and their deriva¬ tives as vasorelaxants, especially in all those emergency clinical situations which require a pharmacological dilatation of the vessels. The patent document WO 89/00,198 in the name o of Biotechnology Research Associates, J.V., submitted on 6th July 1988, covers the synthesis and manipulation of fibroblast growth factor analogues which are useful for achieving an accelerated healing of wounds, bone fractures, burns, damaged myocardial tissue, degenerated neurological tissue and other traumas. However, no mention is made of the possible use of fibroblast growth factor, analogue proteins or compounds derived from s the latter as vasodilators.The family of fibroblast growth factor proteins is better known as broad- spectrum mitogens for cells derived from the mesoderm and the neuroectoderm (Gimenez- Gallego G. et al, Science 1985; 320:1385; Thomas K.A. & Gimenez-Gallego G., Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11:1). However, non-mitogenic activities of basic and acidic fibroblast 0 growth factor have been described (Baird A. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1985; 82:5545; Baird A. & Hsueh J., Regulatory Peptides. 1986; 16:243). Although the central nervous system is very rich in fibroblast growth factors (Thomas A. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1985; 82:6409), the function performed by these proteins in the central nervous system is yet to be determined. Various experimental studies have demonstrated that fibro- s blast growth factors are substances with neurotrophic capacity (Helti F., in: Clane D.B., Grippa D., Trabucchi M., Lonύ G., Horowski R. (eds.), Parkinson and Aging. Raven Press Ltd. New York 1989: 79; Schawaber J.S. et al, J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 309: 79), capable of maintaining the survival of nervous tissue and of inducing, when administered exoge- nously, the regeneration of damaged neurones. It has been verified that the exogenous 0 administration
