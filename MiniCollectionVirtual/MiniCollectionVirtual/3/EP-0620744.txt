<ABSTRACT>
Contrast agents comprising microbubble-generating carbohydrate microparticles having a surfactant admixed within the microparticulate structure (with the proviso that the surfactant is not a saturated C10-20 fatty acid when the microparticulate carbohydrate is galactose) exhibit useful levels of contrast efficiency and/or stability and may be used in diagnostic applications such as ultrasound and MR imaging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel contrast agents,
more particularly to new microparticulate contrast
agents of use in diagnostic imaging.It is well known that ultrasonic imaging comprises
a potentially valuable diagnostic tool, for example in
studies of the vascular system, particularly in
cardiography, and of tissue microvasculature. A variety
of contrast agents has been proposed to enhance the
acoustic images so obtained, including suspensions of
solid particles, emulsified liquid droplets, gas
microbubbles and encapsulated gases or liquids. It is
generally accepted that low density contrast agents
which are easily compressible are particularly efficient
in terms of the acoustic backscatter they generate, and
considerable interest has therefore been shown in the
preparation of gas-containing and gas-generating
systems.Initial studies involving free gas microbubbles
generated invivo by intracardiac injection of
physiologically acceptable substances have demonstrated
the potential efficiency of such bubbles as contrast
agents in echocardiography; such techniques are severely
limited in practice, however, by the short lifetime of
the free bubbles. Interest has accordingly been shown
in methods of generating and/or stabilising gas
microbubbles for echocardiography and other ultrasonic
studies, for example using emulsifiers, oils, thickeners
or sugars.Techniques involving the use of sugars in
ultrasound contrast agents are described in, for
example, US-A-4,681,119, US-A-4,442,843 and US-A-4,657,756,
which disclose the use of particulate solids
having a plurality of gas-filled voids and preferably 
also a plurality of nuclei for microbubble formation.
EP-A-0123235 and EP-A-0122624 suggest ultrasound
contrast agents consisting of surfactant-coated or
surfactant-containing gas-containing microparticles
which may include a variety of sugars. Where
surfactant-containing microparticles are described,
these are prepared simply by commingling the surfactant
with the microparticulate materials, e.g. by
trituration.DE-A-3834705 proposes the use of suspensions
containing microparticles of mixtures of at least one
C10-20 fatty acid with at least one non-surface active
substance, including sugars such as cyclodextrins,
monosaccharides, disaccharides or trisaccharides, as
well as other polyols and inorganic and organic salts;
in practice only the use of galactose as the non-surface
active material and only the use of saturated fatty
acids are exemplified. The microparticulate materials
are typically prepared by
