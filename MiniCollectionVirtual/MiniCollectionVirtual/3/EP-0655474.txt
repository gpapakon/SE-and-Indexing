<ABSTRACT>
Solvent-free, two-component polyurethane reaction adhesives, comprising     1.) a water-containing polyol component, 2.) a polyisocyanate component based on diphenyl methane diisocyanates, and optionally   3.) auxiliaries and additives  are characterised in that   a) the polyol component 1.) contains a maximum of three OH groups and has a water content of from 0.25 to 2.0% by weight and an OH number of 300-600, and b) component 1) and component 2) are present in a mixing ratio such that the isocyanate characteristic number is from 120 to 250. They are used for the production of sandwich-like internal panelling for motor vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Solvent-free, two-component polyurethane reactive
adhesive consisting of


1) a polyol component containing water,
2) a polyisocyanate component based on
diphenylmethane diisocyanates and optionally
3) auxiliary substances and additives,

characterised in that

a) the polyol component 1) has at most three OH
groups, a water content of 0.25 to 2.0 wt.% and

an OH value of 300-600 and
b) component 1) and component 2) are used in a
quantity ratio such that the isocyanate index is

120 to 250.
Solvent-free, two-component polyurethane reactive
adhesive according to claim 1, characterised in that

the water content of component 1) is 0.5 to 1.1 wt.%.
Solvent-free, two-component polyurethane reactive
adhesive according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in

that the index is 140 to 170.
Use of the solvent-free, two-component polyurethane
reactive adhesives according to one of claims 1 to 3

for the production of sandwich-type vehicle interior
trim, in particular automotive interior trim.
