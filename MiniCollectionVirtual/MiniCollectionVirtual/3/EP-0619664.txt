<ABSTRACT>
In a satellite communications system comprising a central station (1) 
and remote stations (2) each remote station sends a pachet containing user 

data on a randomly determined slot of a forward satellite channel. If the 
packet is received by the central station, it sends traffic data and an 

acknowledgment signal. If the absence of acknowledgment signal is 
detected by the remote station, it generates a random number in a range 

determined by the traffic data and increments a count value indicating a 
number of instances where the acknowledgment signal is not returned. 

The packet containing the count value is retransmitted on a time slot 
determined by the random number. If an acknowledgment signal is 

received, the count value is reset to zero. The central station, on receiving 
a packet, generates an acknowledgment signal, and derives a sum of the 

total of packets received during a predetermined interval and the total of 
count values contained in such packets. The traffic data is derived from 

the sum and transmitted with the acknowledgment signal and host data 
on a backward satellite channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to multiple random
access satellite communications system in which satellite channels are
established between a central station and a plurality of remote stations,
and more specifically to a technique for reducing the probability of
collisions between simultaneously transmitted packets.The known slotted ALOHA system is a time division multiple
access satellite communication system for establishing communications
between a central station and a plurality of remote stations. In the slotted
ALOHA system where the communication channel is divided into time
slots, the remote stations send their packets on a randomly accessed time
slot. The beneficial feature of this type of access is the ability to reduce
transmission delay when the rate of transmissions is small. However,
when the rate of transmissions is high, the rate of collisions increases,
resulting in low channel utilization efficiency and long transmission delay.
To avoid poor system utilization efficiency as a result of high transmission
rate, it is necessary to decrease retransmissions and to avoid collisions
between retransmitted packets. A method that is generally employed for
retransmission is to use a random number to specify a period of time the
conflicting station must wait before an attempt is made to gain access to
the channel. If the number of random numbers that can be generated is
small, there is a high likelihood of coincidence between two or more
remote stations using the same random number. Further, if the rate of
retransmissions and hence the rate of collisions is high, it is more effective
for the remote stations using a greater range of random numbers to
reduce traffic congestion than for those remote stations using a smaller 
range of random numbers. However, at low retransmission rates
conflicting stations may wait an unnecessarily long period of time before
they are allowed to retransmit a packet.In an article "Delay analysis of a satellite channel
reservation system with variable frame format" by
Mine, H et al (IEEE Proc., Vol. 130, June 1983, pgs. 343-349),
a channel reservation system in a multiple access satellite
communications system using a variable frame format is described. In this system, the satellite
has processing capability. Each user is assigned a minislot in the uplink header of
each frame, stores a queue (count number) of unscheduled packets and reports the
queue status through the assigned minislot to the satellite. Based on the reported
queue status, the satellite
