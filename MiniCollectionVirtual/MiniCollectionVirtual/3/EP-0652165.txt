<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cigarette pack (1) which can be used in cigarette machines in exchange for packs of king-size cigarettes, having an essentially cuboid appearance, in which a number of cigarettes are received in the pack aligned adjacently with their longitudinal axis perpendicular to the longitudinal main axis (3) of the cigarette pack, it being possible for these cigarettes to be removed from the cigarette pack individually through a single opening, which can be closed by an opening means (6) extending on a longitudinal side (5) of the cigarette pack, and only in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal main axis of said pack. In particular, the cigarette pack constitutes a hard box, the opening means constituting a closure which can be pivoted about an axis running parallel to the longitudinal main axis of the cigarette pack. Since the length of the cigarettes is bounded by the width of the pack, it is possible to accommodate a number of about 36 to 44 cigarettes in the cigarette pack.
