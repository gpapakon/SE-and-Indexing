<ABSTRACT>
An ejector mechanism (10) is disclosed in 
conjunction with a header connector (12) into which an IC 

pack (14) is loaded and from which it is ejected. The IC 
pack includes a vertically extending leading face (14) and 

at least one row of contacts extending a horizontal 
distance defining a contact array (53) which is adapted to 

interconnect with a corresponding terminal array (51) on 
the header connector. A unitary ejecting lever (18) is 

pivotally mounted to the header connector, with a first end 
(38) of the lever being effective to engage and eject the 

IC pack from the header connector. A unitary push-rod (20) 
is reciprocally axially movably mounted on an appropriate 

support at one side of the header connector. One end of 
the push rod (20b) is engageable with the other end of the 

ejecting lever for pivoting the lever in response to manual 
actuation of the push-rod. The first end of the ejecting 

lever engages and ejects the IC pack along the leading face 
thereof in an area defined horizontally by the distance the 

row of contacts extends and vertically by the height of the 
leading face of the memory card.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a connector 
apparatus having a header connector adapted for receiving 
a memory card or IC pack, with means for ejecting the IC 
pack therefrom. A conventional connector apparatus for an IC pack 
or memory card includes a generally U-shaped frame having 
a pair of guide grooves inside each of a pair of side frame 
portions, with a connector section joining or extending 
between the side frame portions. A planar IC pack or 
memory card, in a rectangular card package, is inserted 
into the apparatus between the side frame portions within 
the side guide grooves. A transverse array of socket 
terminals on a leading face of the IC pack electrically 
connect to an associated array of pin terminals on the 
connector section. Such connector apparatus often are provided with 
header connectors used for interconnecting semi-conductor 
or memory chips of the IC pack to a main electronic unit of 
a computer, for example. The header connector is used in 
conjunction with the IC pack or memory card for removably 
coupling the IC pack to a printed circuit board in the main 
electronic unit. The IC pack is inserted into the header 
connector and is extracted therefrom as needed. The 
extraction force of the IC pack, i.e. the force between the 
respective terminal pins on the header connector and the  
 
respective socket terminals of the IC pack, is relatively 
high due to the tight fit required to obtain a good 
electrical interconnection between the terminals. These 
terminals typically are disposed at a high density which 
further increases the extraction forces. Previously, when 
an IC pack was to be extracted from a header connector, the 
card was grasped by a user and simply pulled out. However, problems have been encountered in 
removing IC packs from header connectors. Specifically, 
when the IC pack or memory card is extracted manually, 
considerable force may be required to overcome the fitting 
friction between the terminals of the header connector and 
those of the IC pack. In using such force, the extracting 
direction often is not axial or precisely perpendicular to 
the terminal interface, and the terminals may be damaged. 
Consequently, a variety of ejecting mechanisms have been 
incorporated in various connector apparatus, such as the 
header connectors, for facilitating the ejection of an IC 
pack from a header connector. Some ejecting mechanisms 
have been incorporated as integral or unitary devices 
fabricat
