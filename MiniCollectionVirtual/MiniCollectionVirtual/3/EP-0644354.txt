<ABSTRACT>
A preloadable cord lock for gripping a cord, such as an 
elastic shock cord, includes a pair of telescoping 

members (2,3) having apertures (4,5) defined therethrough. The 
telescoping members (2,3) are biased so that their respective 

apertures (4,5) are not aligned. The lock can be preloaded to 
a condition where the apertures (4,5) are aligned for feeding a 

cord through the apertures (4,5). The preloading mechanism may 
then be disengaged which will cause the telescoping 

members (2,3) to be urged to a position where their apertures 
(4,5) are not aligned by the bias of the device, thereby 

pinching and locking the cord in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to cord locks and 
holders, for example, for use with luggage, baggage, 
baggage carriers, etc. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a new cord lock which can be preloaded for 
ready use and which can subsequently be actuated in an 
easy manner. Cord locks are known in the art for gripping and 
retaining cord, for example, an elastic shock cord, under 
tension. Such devices typically include a pair of 
telescoping members which have apertures therethrough. 
One telescoping member is biased with respect to the 
other, so that their respective apertures are not 
aligned. In order to use the cord lock, it is necessary 
to load it by squeezing the two telescoping members 
together so that their respective apertures are aligned. 
The user must continue to apply pressure to hold the two 
members together in this aligned state while 
simultaneously threading the cord through the apertures. 
Once the cord is threaded, the user may release the 
pressure which is exerted on the two members. Because 
the two members are biased so that their apertures are 
misaligned, they will pinch the cord which has been 
threaded therethrough so as to retain the cord in a fixed 
position. Although this design has proven to be effective in 
holding and locking a cord, such as an elastic shock  
 
cord, one principal disadvantage is that the user must 
continue to exert pressure to align the apertures of the 
two telescoping members while simultaneously threading 
the cord through the apertures. Because the biasing 
force which is necessary to sufficiently grip the cord is 
relatively strong, a relatively large amount of finger 
pressure must be applied to align the apertures. Thus, 
it can be cumbersome to simultaneously thread the cord 
through the apertures while maintaining the apertures 
aligned (i.e., loading the device). US Patent 5,197,166 describes a cord lock latchable with the apertures aligned by means of resilient legs engaging behind a special ring and releasable by further inward pressure. Another shortcoming of the prior art is that there is a 
risk that the lock can be inadvertently disengaged by 
someone squeezing the two telescoping members together, 
thereby relieving the tension on the cord and allowing 
the cord to slip. To minimize the risk of accidental 
disengagement, the prior art employs a very strong 
biasing means which requires a great amount of force to 
oppose. However, as discussed above, this makes the lock 
all the more difficult to load prior to threading

<CLAIMS>
A preloadable cord lock (1) comprising: 

an outer telescoping member (3) having an aperture (5) 
defined therethrough; 
an inner telescoping member (2) having an aperture (4) 
defined therethrough, the inner member (2) being 

slidable within the outer member (3) ; 
a means (9, 17) for retaining the cord lock in a preloaded 
position where the aperture (4) of the inner member (2) is 

at least partially aligned with the aperture (5) of the 
outer member (3) such that the cord lock may receive a 

cord through an area defined by an overlap of both 
of said apertures (4, 5) in said preloaded position, the means 

for retaining including cooperating projection means (10, 17) 
integrally formed with each of the inner and outer telescoping 

members (2,3); 
a means (6) for biasing said inner and outer members (2, 3) 
toward a cord locking position where the aperture (4) of 

the inner member (2) is out of alignment with the 
aperture (5) of the outer member (3) to an extent which is 

sufficient to pinch a cord threaded through the 
overlap of the apertures (4, 5); and 
a means (13) for disengaging said means for retaining (9, 17). 
The cord lock according to claim 1 wherein the means 
for disengaging includes a tab (13) belonging to the 

outer telescoping member (3), the tab (13) being movable 
against the projection means (10) belonging to the inner 

telescoping member (2) in the preloaded position for 
forcing the projection means (10) of the inner 

telescoping member (2) clear from the projection means (17)  
 

belonging to the outer telescoping member (3), thereby 
allowing the inner telescoping member (2) to move to the 

cord locking position under force exerted by the 
biasing means (6). 
The cord lock according to claim 2 wherein the means 
for disengaging includes a pair of tabs (13) and wherein 

the projection means belonging to the inner 
telescoping member (2) includes a pair of arms (9), each arm 

having a wing (10). 
The cord lock according to claim 3 wherein the 
projection means belonging to the outer telescoping 

member includes a pair of opposed projections (17), each 
projection being adapted for cooperative engagement 

with one of said wings (10). 
The cord lock according to claim 4 wherein the pair 
of opposed projection (17) and the pair of wings (10) each 

include an inclined surface (18, 11), said inclined surfaces 
being adapted for permitting sliding movement of the 

wings (10) past the opposed projections (17) when the 
telescoping members (2, 3) are moved from the cord locking 

position to the preloaded position. 
The cord lock according to claim 5 wherein each of 
said opposed projections (17) and said wings (10) includes a 

second surface (19, 12), said second surfaces (12) of said wings (10) 
being adapted for engaging said second surfaces (19) of 

the opposed projections (17) in said preloaded position 
for preventing sliding movement of the wings (10) over 

the opposed projections (17). 
The cord lock according to claim 6 wherein each wing (10) 
includes a third surface (20) joining said inclined 

surface (11) and said second surface (12), each third surface (20) 
engaging a tab (13) belonging to the outer telescoping  

 
member (3) in said preloaded position. 
The cord lock according to any preceding claim wherein said 
biasing means is a spring (6) coupled between said inner 

and outer telescoping members (2, 3) which is compressible 
to a compressed position in said preloaded position. 
The cord lock according to any preceding claim wherein said 
inner telescoping member (2) is entirely receded within 

said outer telescoping member (3) in said preloaded 
position and in said cord locking position.
