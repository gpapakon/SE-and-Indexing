<ABSTRACT>
A blood dialyzer is produced by a process in which a 
plurality of artificial composite fibers having core 

portions consisting of a water-insoluble core liquid and 
surrounded by sheath portions consisting of a fiber-forming 

polymer are subjected to a removal of almost all 
of the core liquid; the resultant hollow fibers are 

bundled; the hollow fiber bundle is packed in a 
cylindrical case having open end; end portions of spaces 

left between the hollow fibers peripheries and between 
the hollow fibers and the inside surface of the 

cylindrical case are sealed with a bonding material, to 
fix the hollow fiber bundle to the cylindrical case at 

the end portions thereof; and the hollow fibers in the 
cylindrical case are cleaned with a cleaning liquid 

comprising at least one selected from aliphatic 
monohydric alcohols having 3 to 8 carbon atoms and 

aqueous solution of surfactants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a blood dialyzer. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a process for producing a 
blood dialyzer from artificial blood-dialyzing hollow 
fibers which have been produced by using a core liquid 
consisting of a water-insoluble liquid and from which 
almost all of the core liquid has been removed, by 
forming a bundle from the artificial hollow fibers, 
packing the artificial hollow fibers in a tubular case to 
produce a blood dialyzer module, and fixing the fibers to 
the tubular case with a bonding material, and removing a 
residual fraction of the core liquid from the artificial 
hollow fibers. A blood dialyzing membrane is used to execute 
the function of a living kidney for a patient having an 
incompletely functioning kidney. In the early stage of 
the development of the blood dialyzer, a blood dialyzing 
membrane was employed to remove relatively low molecular 
weight substances, for example, urea and creatinine from 
the blood. Recently, new types of high quality blood 
dialyzing membranes which are in the form of hollow 
fibers and can effectively remove medium molecular weight 
substances, for example, β₂-microglobulin,from the blood 
were developed and are now becoming more important. The processes for producing the high quality 
artificial hollow fiber membranes for the blood dialyzer 
are classified into two classes, for example, a dry 
spinning process and a dry-jet wet spinning process. The 
dry-jet wet spinning process is advantageously utilized 
in industry because the resultant hollow fibers exhibit  
 
an excellent blood dialyzing performance. In the dry-jet wet spinning process for 
producing the hollow filaments, a core liquid is used to 
form a hollow space in an individual hollow filament. In 
this spinning process, a core liquid and a dope solution 
containing a fiber-forming polymer is extruded through a 
hollow filament-forming nozzle to form a filamentary 
composite stream consisting of a filamentary core stream 
of the core liquid and a filamentary sheath stream of the 
polymer dope solution surrounding the core stream. The 
extruded filamentary composite stream is partially dried 
and then introduced into a coagulating liquid bath to 
coagulate the filamentary sheath stream to produce a 
composite filament consisting of a core portion 
consisting of the core liquid and a sheath portion 
consisting of the coagulated polymer and surrounding the 
core portion. As the core liquid, a water-insoluble liquid,
