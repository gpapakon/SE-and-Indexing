<ABSTRACT>
In a serial printer a pinion and a rack for lateral movement of a carriage, 
a dislodging member (21) with edges proximate to the rack (16) is provided 

to remove any chads or other foreign matters that may be attached to the rack, 
as they approach the pinion (20) with the lateral movement of the carriage. 

The chads or other foreign matters are prevented from being caught between 
the pinion and the rack, and noises and increase in the torque due to the 

rolling in is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a serial printer, and 
particularly to its carriage movement mechanism, for 
laterally moving the print head in the direction parallel to 
the surface of the platen, or parallel to the axis of a 
cylindrical platen. Carriage movement mechanisms used in serial printers, 
for laterally moving a carriage on which a print head is 
mounted, are usually formed of a pinion rotatably mounted to 
the carriage, a rack fixed to the housing of the printer, 
extending in the direction of the lateral movement of the 
carriage and meshing with the pinion, and a guide shaft 
fixed to the housing of the printer and provided in parallel 
with the rack. The carriage is slidably mounted to the 
guide shaft, and is moved by rotation of the pinion meshing 
with the rack. Where the platen is cylindrical, the 
carriage is moved in parallel with the axis of the platen. 
Where the platen is planar the carriage is moved in parallel 
with the surface of the platen. The print head is driven in 
timed relationship with the lateral movement of the 
carriage, to perform printing on a printing medium Passing 
over the platen. In a printer of the bottom-pull type, a printing 
medium, such as a sprocket paper, is inserted into the  
 
printer housing from the lower or bottom part of the 
printer, and passed over the platen. This is to minimize 
the turning or curvature of the printing medium while it is 
fed through the printer. Minimizing the curvature is 
particularly advantageous where the printing medium is 
thick, such as when the printing medium consists of a 
multiply-paper, typically in the form of sprocket paper. 
When the sprocket paper is used as the printing medium, pull 
tractors are used for supporting and feeding the sprocket 
paper. The pull tractors have pins which are engaged with 
the sprocket holes of the sprocket paper and the pins are 
rotated for feeding the sprocket paper. In the bottom-pull 
printer, the pull tractors are usually positioned above the 
platen to apply a certain tension to the sprocket paper 
passing over the platen, to thereby smoothly feed or convey 
the sprocket paper over the platen. In the conventional carriage movement mechanism, the 
rack is formed of an insulating material such as plastics or 
hard rubber, and is charged with static electricity, so that 
fine dust or paper scrap may be attracted to it. In the 
printer of the bottom-pull type, if the sprocket paper that 
is loaded on the printer has their sprocket holes 
incompletely open, i.e., has circular

<CLAIMS>
A serial printer, comprising 

a carriage (13) on which a print head is mounted, and 
which is capable of translation movement; 
a pinion (20) rotatably mounted to the carriage (13); 
a rack (16) meshing with the pinion; and 
a dislodging member (21, 31, 32, 33, 34) having an edge 
(21a, 31a, 32a, 33a, 34a) proximate to the rack (16) and 

provided adjacent to the pinion whereby said dislodging 
member serves to remove, by means of said edge, any foreign 

matters approaching the gap between the rack and the pinion. 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein said 
dislodging member is mounted to the carriage (13). 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein said 
dislodging member is mounted to a cover (17) of a motor (11) 

provided to drive the pinion (16). 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein said 
dislodging member has an additional edge provided opposite 

to said first-mentioned edge with respect to said pinion, 
and also proximate to said rack.  

 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein said 
dislodging member is substantially semi-cylindrical, having 

edges defining said first-mentioned edge and said additional 
edge. 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein said 
dislodging member (31, 32, 33, 34) comprises a first member 

(31) and a second member (32) opposite to each other with 
respect to said pinion and having said first-mentioned edge 

and said additional edge. 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 6, wherein said 
dislodging member further comprises a third member (33) and 

a fourth member (34) which are respectively provided 
adjacent to said first and second members (31, 32), and have 

further edges (33a, 34a) proximate to said rack. 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1 wherein said 
edge extends across the width of said rack. 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein said 
edge extends in a direction inclined with respect to the 

longitudinal direction of the rack. 
A serial printer as set forth in claim 1, wherein the  
 

gap between said edge and peaks of teeth of the rack is such 
that any chad projecting away from the rack are removed by 

said edge.
