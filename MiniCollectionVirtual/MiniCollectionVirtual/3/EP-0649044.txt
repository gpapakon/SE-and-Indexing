<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal active lens having a combination of a 
fixed focus lens having a high refractive index and a phase modulation 

element having a two-dimensional arrangement of very 
small pixels which has a power, and whose lens characteristics 

can be controlled electrically as a spatial function. With this lens, 
it is possible to implement the control of an optical system electronically 

without any movable parts. The focal length can be 
controlled electronically by a structure in which a liquid crystal 

spatial phase modulation element and a fixed-focus high power 
lens are coupled. Further, a spatial division control is possible by 

electronic control of the lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical device that
can be electronically controlled. More specifically, the invention
relates to a structure for realizing a mechanism that
electrically controls the characteristics of an optical device
by controlling the phase of fine liquid crystal elements.The characteristics of an optical device have heretofore
mostly been controlled by changing the mechanical relationships
in a structure which is made up of a combination of a
plurality of glass lenses having predetermined optical characteristics.
Though the characteristics could be excellently
controlled, the mechanical structure of the device invites
play due to aging, permits oil to freeze when used in very
cold areas and is further accompanied by an increase in the
weight and volume.In recent years, liquid crystal elements have been developed
for display purposes and efforts have been made to utilize
the diffractive anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules 
for developing the action of a prism or a lens. However, effects
sufficient for use as an optical component using such
liquid crystal elements alone have mostly not been accomplished
since the liquid crystal layer is too thin for folding
light and the molecules are not uniformly oriented when
the thickness of the layer increases.Further, optical devices have been proposed in which a conventional
lens is combined with a phase modulation element
formed by a liquid crystal element having fine pixels for
modulating the phase of wave of transmitted light. Such liquid
crystal element can be a ferroelectric one, as disclosed
in the paper S.E. Broomfield et al., 'Programmable diffractive
optics with a ferroelectric liquid crystal SLM in a binary
phase-only mode', SPIE Holographics International vol.
1732, 1992, page 287, and also in the paper M.J. O'Callaghan
et al., 'Diffractive ferroelectric liquid-crystal shutters
for unpolarized light', Optics Letters vol. 16, 1991, page
770, the latter document showing that the imaging position of
the combined lens and liquid crystal element optical system
can be controlled in a plane normal to the optical axis by
accordingly electrically controlling the phase modulating
liquid crystal element. The paper M.W. Fritsch et al.,
'Twisted-nematic liquid crystals for phase modulation in
Schlieren optical projection systems', Proceedings of the
SID, vol. 32, 1991, page 305 discloses the use of a twisted-nematic
liquid crystal element or an untwisted planar-oriented
nematic liquid crystal element as a phase modulation
element in
