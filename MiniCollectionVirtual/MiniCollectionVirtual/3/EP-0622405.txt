hydrogen atoms each directly attached to a 
silicon atom in a molecule, and (C) a platinum 

catalyst, (D) a compound having a phenyl group 
and a secondary or tertiary amino group directly 

attached thereto is added to render the

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to flame retardant
silicone compositions, their preparation and use. In
particular it concerns such compositions which are curable
to a transparent product, e.g. so as to be suitable for
the protection of ICs or hybrid ICs.For addition curing type silicone rubber
compositions which cure into elastomers, a
number of techniques are known for rendering
them flame retardant. The most basic technique
is to add platinum compounds to organopolysiloxanes.
The addition of benzotriazoles,
hydrazines and similar compounds is known
effective for improving flame retardancy. Fumed
titanium oxide, cerium oxide, cerium hydroxide,
iron oxide and carbon powder are also known
effective.All the prior art silicone rubber
compositions of this type contain reinforcing
inorganic fillers such as fumed silica and 
quartz powder. Flame retardant silicone compositions
essentially free from reinforcing inorganic fillers
are unknown.EP-A-153700 describes organopolysiloxane
compositions consisting of an organopolysiloxane
containing at least two silicon-bonded alkenyl groups
per molecule, an organohydrogenpolysiloxane
containing at least two organohydrogensiloxane or
hydrogensiloxane units per molecule, a platinum-type
catalyst, an addition-reaction retarder which may
include benzotriazole, and a photosensitizer. Flame
retardancy is not discussed.One known transparent material based on
organopolysiloxane is silicone gel which finds use as
a filler for parts used in optical equipment, a
protective material for hybrid Ics used in electric
and electronic parts to be mounted on automobiles,
and a protective sealing agent for commercial power
modules.Although flame retardancy is essentially
required in these fields, prior art silicone
compositions could not meet the requirement. It was
a common approach in the art to ensure that parts as
a whole are flame retardant. As greater attention is
now paid to the environmental problem, the 
requirement for flame retardancy becomes severe.
There is a need for a silicone composition which
offers not only transparency, but also flame
retardancy.Working with silicone compositions comprising
(A) an organopolysiloxane having at least two alkenyl
groups in a molecule, (B) an 
organohydrogenpolysiloxane having at least two
hydrogen atoms each directly attached to a
silicon atom in a molecule, (C) a platinum
catalyst, and curing to a transparent product,
we have found firstly that when (D) a
compound having a phenyl group and a secondary
or tertiary amino group directly
