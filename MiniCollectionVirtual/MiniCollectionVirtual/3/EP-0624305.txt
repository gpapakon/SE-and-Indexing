<ABSTRACT>
An electrical head interconnect assembly is fabricated for installation upon the suspension member supporting a magnetic read/write head over a rotating storage disk of a magnetic disk drive. An interconnect is comprised of a film carrier strip (50) upon which conducting elements (52) are positioned and bonded. The conducting elements (52) are routed along a prepatterned carrier strip defining the X, Y and Z coordinate positioning required to mate with a suspension member (54) without manual routing or manipulation. The conducting elements are fixedly spaced with stripped insulation at both termination points of the interconnect (electronics and head) allowing prepositioned, automatable bonding to connective pads. A suspension member (54) positioned and bonded within the strip at appendage sites, completes the installation of the conducting elements (52) upon the suspension. The carrier then serves to secure the conductors and suspension within the protective framework of the strip and provides patterned tooling references (62) until excised upon completion of suspension assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CARRIER STRIP HEAD INTERCONNECT ASSEMBLY Background of the Invention Summary of the Invention Technical Area of the Present Invention In a magnetic disk drive, a slider (or head) is flown above a spinning storage disk. Attached to the slider is a read/write transducer which transforms electrical pulses to small magnetic fields which are stored on the disk. The order of the magnetic fields and their subsequent orientation, aligned along the circumference of the disk in north-south configuration, defines a bit code capable of detection as the slider flies over the disk. The sliders are held in place above the disk by a metal spring structure known in the industry as a suspension. This suspension attaches to a rigid arm manipulated by a linear or rotary motion actuator designed to locate the slider at any radial position above the disk. The spinning disk coupled with the actuator movement serves to gain access to multiple tracks across the disk surface, each capable of containing stored data for later retrieval.Signal transmission from the slider transducer to the amplifier and signal processing circuitry of the disk file, necessitates the need for an electrical interconnect between the dynamic, "flying" slider, and the static circuitry of the data channels. A printed flexible circuit routed from the signal processing circuitry to the vicinity of the actuator arms, connects with conductive wire(s) to complete the final path down the suspension to the slider. 

 The interconnect routed down the suspension typically contains a minimum of two conductors serving the slider transducer comprised of a single inductive element to read and write. Transducer designs may also incorporate a separate magneto-resistive read element and an inductive write element requiring a minimum of 3 wires if the elements are tied together or a minimum of 4 wires if the elements are completely separate. The dynamic requirements of flying the slider close to the disk surface (< 0.1 micrometer) necessitates minimum mass, stiffness, and size for this interconnect.2. Description of the Prior Art. This invention pertains to the interconnecting device spanning the suspension, from the slider transducer to the printed flexible circuit mating with or containing the signal processing devices. As the industry transitions to smaller slider/transducer sizes to increase data storage density, limitations of the current interconnecting devices increases the potential for read/write errors and imposes ceilings on data storage density.
