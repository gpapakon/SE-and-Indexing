<ABSTRACT>
A set of minimal polynomials for generating a multidimensional 
array for decoding algebraic geometric codes is 

derived at a high speed. In order to obtain a set of minimal 
polynomials F for generating a given multidimensional array, 

when sequentially updating a set of polynomials F, df
n
(i)
 
are not directly calculated, and a newly introduced set of 

polynomials B and the set of polynomials F are updated using 
the highest-degree coefficient d
i
 of polynomials which 
belong to the set of polynomials B. An array memory for 

storing a given multidimensional array u, and first and 
second polynomial memories for storing the set of polynomials 

F to be obtained and a set of auxiliary polynomials G, 
respectively, are provided. In the calculation of polynomials 

f
(k)
 and df
n+1
(k)
 , accessing operations for respective 
memories and accessed addresses are controlled in parallel 

depending on the degrees of polynomials f
(k)
.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to error correction, in which in
a digital communication system and a digital storage system,
errors produced in a communication channel or a storage
medium are corrected at the reception side using error correction
codes. More particularly, the invention relates to a
polynominal -set deriving apparatus and method, in which in a
decoding operation using algebraic geometric codes as error
correction codes, a set of minimal polynomials for generating
a given multidimensional array corresponding to a
syndrome in received words is obtained.RS (Reed-Solomon codes) codes and BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem)
codes are well known as error correction codes
for correcting errors produced in a communication channel or
a storage medium at the reception side in a digital communication
system and a digital storage system. These codes
are actually used in apparatuses which deal with compact 
discs, satellite communication and the like.Recently, however, codes named algebraic geometric
codes utilizing the algebraic curve theory have been widely
studied (see references (1) - (3)). Algebraic geometric
codes belong to a code system which has a very wide applicational
range, and which includes the above-described RS
codes and BCH codes. It has gradually become clear that this
system includes new codes having better properties than
those of conventional codes (see reference (4)).Decoding methods have always been a problem while such
excellent codes have been discovered, and development of an
efficient decoding algorithm has been requested. However, an
efficient decoding algorithm has not been obtained at all until
Justesen et al. have proposed a generalized Peterson algorithm
(see reference (5)) in 1989. Justesen et al. have
shown that by applying the Sakata algorithm (see reference
(6)) proposed by Sakata to their generalized Peterson algorithm
to provide an efficient algorithm for obtaining a two-dimensional
linear feedback shift register, having a minimum
number of storage elements, for generating a two-dimensional
array having a given finite size, an error locator function
can be derived at a high speed with a small amount of calculation.However, since the generalized Peterson algorithm has a
limitation in its correction capability, Skorobogatov et 
al. have proposed a Modified decoding algorithm (see
reference (7)) which guarantees a higher correction
capability.Furthermore, since the Sakata algorithm includes a
large amount of useless calculation not directly relating to
the Modified decoding
