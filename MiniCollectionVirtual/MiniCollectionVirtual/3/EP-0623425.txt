<ABSTRACT>
The powered wrench has a casing (10) consisting of a head part (11) and a drive part (12). The drive part (12) contains a cylinder bush (21) which is inserted into the casing (10) from the side facing away from the head part (11). A pressure channel which is connected to a hose connection (41) consists of a longitudinal bore (45) which runs in the wall of the cylinder bush (21) in order to supply the rear cylinder (36) with the high pressure required. As a result, it is avoided that the casing (10) is additionally subjected to the hydraulic pressure in the region of the support. In the event of the pressure line rupturing, the casing (10) still holds the cylinder bush (21) together.

A power wrench with a housing (10) comprising a head portion 
(11) with a rotatably supported annular member (14) 

and a rotatably supported lever (17) for driving the annular 
member, and a drive portion (12) comprising a cylinder 

sleeve (21) and a piston (28) movable therein, whose 
piston rod (29) engages the lever (17), at least one hose 

connector (41) being provided on the drive portion (12) and 
a pressure channel extending in longitudinal direction of 

the drive portion (12), which pressure channel forms part 
of the cylinder sleeve (21) and connects the hose connector 

(41) to a cylinder chamber (36) of the cylinder sleeve 
(21),
characterized in that
 
the hose connector (41) is laterally arranged on the drive 

portion (12), and the pressure channel extends in the wall 
of the cylinder sleeve (21) as a longitudinal bore and 

connects the hose connector (41) to the rearward cylinder 
chamber (36). 
The power wrench according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least two longitudinal bores (45,45a) are provided 

which are connected, at the front end of the cylinder 
sleeve (21), to an outer circumferential annular groove 

(48) and open into the rearward cylinder chamber (36). 
The power wrench according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a further hose connector (42) is provided which is 

connected to a transverse bore (50) of the housing (10) and 
opens into that portion of the housing interior located in 

front of the cylinder sleeve (21).  
 
The power wrench according to claim 3, characterized in 
that a lid (51) axially supporting the cylinder sleeve (21) 

and comprising a radial passage (52) and centering a bushing 
(34) movable with the piston (28) is arranged in that 

region in which the transverse bore (50) opens into the 
housing interior. 
The power wrench according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the cylinder sleeve (21) comprises, in its 

rearward half, an external thread (27) which is screwed 
into the housing (10). 
The power wrench according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the cylinder sleeve (120) is pivotably 

supported within the housing (100), and that the cylinder 
sleeve (120) comprises a pocket bore (121) closed by a plug 

(123) comprising a sealed passage (125) for the piston rod 
(128) of the piston (127). 
The power wrench according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the front portion of the cylinder sleeve (120) adjacent 

to the plug (123) comprises a laterally projecting 
connection piece (137) passing through an opening (138) of 

the housing (110). 
The power wrench according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the section of the housing (110) including 

the cylinder sleeve (120) has a polygonal profile or 
splined shaft profile onto which the annular holder (145) 

of a support foot (144) can be slipped. 
The power wrench according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the cylinder sleeve bottom wall (122) is spherically 

supported on the housing (110). 
The power wrench according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the front end of the piston rod (128) is 

spherically supported on the lever (114).
