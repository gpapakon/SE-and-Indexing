<ABSTRACT>
A multiple metallized film capacitor in which the metal layers are 
varied in thickness such that high oxidation areas are thicker than low oxidation areas. 

In particular, the edge portions (20) bordering a center margin 
electrode gap (11) have a 

thickness which is greater than the remaining area of the center 
margin electrode (16,17). The 

increased thickness at the edge portions reduces the oxidation effect and the associated 
decrease in capacitance which normally occurs due to the electric potential across the 

gap. By varying the thickness, the oxidation effect at the edge portions is reduced while 
the self-healing capabilities at the low oxidation areas is maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metallized film capacitor and, in 
particular, to a metallized film series section capacitor. The invention also relates to a 
method for manufacturing such capacitor. Metallized film capacitors typically include sheets of dielectric material 
each sheet having a conductive layer thereon, usually a metal, which layers form the 
capacitor electrodes. The conductive layers are generally applied to only one side of the 
dielectric and the conductive layers on a dielectric are placed against the uncoated side 
of an adjacent dielectric. The conductive layers are then electrically insulated from each 
other by the dielectric which holds a charge. A series section metallized film capacitor includes a center margin 
electrode and a floating electrode, as shown in Figure 1. The center margin electrode 
(15) is formed of two adjacent conductive layers (16, 17), which are spaced from one 
another by a gap (11). The floating electrode includes a second dielectric (19) having a 
conductive layer (13) thereon opposite the two layers (16), (17). A first capacitance is 
formed by the first conductive layer (16) of the center margin electrode, the dielectric 
(12) and the floating electrode (13). A second capacitance is formed by the second 
conductive layer (17) of the center margin electrode, the dielectric (12) and floating 
electrode (13). The common floating electrode connects the two capacitances in series 
which creates a potential between the conductive layers (16, 17) across the gap (11) of 
the center margin electrode. Metallized film capacitors are known to have a "self-healing" capability, 
whereby short circuits between the conducting layers on opposite sides of the dielectric 
caused by a fault in the dielectric will be "cleared" or "self-healed". Self healing occurs 
in a series section capacitor when a defect in the dielectric (12) causes the center margin 
electrode (15) to short to the floating electrode (13) causing the metal of the electrodes 
to oxidize. The oxidation acts as an insulator which heals the short. If the metal forming  
 
the center margin electrode, however, is too thick, the heat required to oxidize and/or 
vaporize the metal will cause the center margin electrode to melt through the dielectric 
to the floating electrode creating an internal short which will not heal. A problem associated with previous metallized film series section 
capacitors arises at the gap of the center margin electrode. The potential created across 
the gap causes the metal
