<ABSTRACT>
There are provided novel aminophosphonic acid 
derivatives of the general formula [I]
: 

wherein n is an integer of 2 or 3; R¹ is a phenyl, 
naphthyl, indolyl, benzothienyl, benzofuryl or benzoxazolyl 

group which may have 1 to 3 substituents 
selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl and lower 

alkyloxy groups, or a hydrogen atom; R² is a lower alkyl 
group, a benzyl group, a 4-hydroxybenzyl group, a 

3-indolylmethyl group or a β-phenethyl group; and A is 
an optional residue of an amino acid selected from the 

group consisting of tryptophane, tyrosine, phenylalanine, 
homophenylalanine, naphthylalanine or N
ω
-nitroarginine, 
and their pharmaceutically acceptable 

salts. The compounds according to the present invention 
and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit an 

inhibitory activity against endothelin-converting 
enzyme, and are expected to be useful as a drug treating 

various diseases with which endothelin is concerned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds 
which exhibit an inhibitory activity against endothelin-converting 
enzyme, and uses of the novel 
compounds. The compounds of the present invention and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof exhibit 
vasodilator and bronchodilator effects, and thus may be 
used in the field of medicine as a drug for the 
treatment of a disorder related to endothelin such as 
hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, Raynaud's disease, 
Buerger's disease, Takayasu's disease, Kawasaki's 
disease, diabetes, bronchial asthma, arteriosclerosis, 
acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, angina 
pectoris, cerebral vasospasm, cerebral infarction, 
endotoxin shock, endotoxin-induced multiple organ 
failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
cyclosporin- or cisplatin-induced renal failure or 
hypertension, congestive heart failure, vascular 
restenosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. It is known that endothelin is a polypeptide 
composed of 21 amino acid residues, is produced by 
endothelial cells of human or other mammals, and  
 
exhibits a potent vasoconstrictor effect and a 
prolonged, potent pressor action. It is also known that 
the production mechanism for endothelin begins with the 
biosynthesis of preproendothelin, which undergoes 
processing in the cells to become big endothelin, 
followed by the hydrolysis of the peptide bond between 
Trp21-val22 of big endothelin by endothelin-converting 
enzyme to produce endothelin. It is further known that 
endothelin-converting enzyme itself is a phosphoramidon-sensitive 
neutral metalloprotease (Nature, Vol. 
332, p.411-415, 1988; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 
Vol. 168, p.1128-1136, 1990; Ibid, Vol. 171, 
p.1192-1198, 1990; FEBS Letters, Vol. 272, p.166-170, 
1990). As reported, the levels of endothelin are clearly 
elevated in the blood of patients with essential 
hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary 
hypertension, Raynaud's disease, atherosclerosis, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, Buerger's disease, Takayasu's disease, 
Kawasaki's disease, diabetes, or renal failure caused by 
administration of cisplatin, and also in the washing 
fluids of respiratory tract or the blood of asthma 
patients as compared with normal levels (Japan J. 
Hypertension, Vol. 12, p.79, 1989; J. of Vascular 
Medicine Biology, Vol. 2, p.207, 1990; J. of Am. Med. 
Association, Vol. 264, p.2868, 1990; The Lancet, Vol. 2,  
 
p.747-748, 1989, Vol. 2, p.1144-1147, 1990; J. of Int. 
Secr.
