<ABSTRACT>
In a double carrier-roll winder, in order to be able to produce large-calibre reels of good quality, the carrier rolls (11) and (12) have different diameters and different height positions. The main weight load of the reel is carried by the carrier roll (11), while the carrier roll (12) bears on the reel (13) with the smallest possible nip pressure which is sufficient to transmit to the reel the necessary torque difference to generate the desired reel tension. The carrier roll (12) can be lowered, with increasing reel diameter, according to the function that the reel axis (13A) is displaced along a predetermined vertical or slightly inclined movement line (14; 15), which preferably extends in a straight line. An additional centre drive, which becomes possible as a result, can improve the winding result still further. A handling device (50) serves as a multifunctional device for the reel change, in particular for the ejection of the reel, the clamping and bringing into position of the web end for the next reel and the severing of the finished reel from the material web (1; 1', 1'', ...).

roller, and the axis of the other support roller during the winding is positioned higher

means (20) are used for detecting the position of the axis or axes (13A)

(12A) of the second support roller (12) to be lowered in such a way that, as a function

(13A) of the roll or rolls (13; 13'; 13'', ...) moves or move along the pre-set line of
