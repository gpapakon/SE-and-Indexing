<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
mesomorphic compound, a liquid crystal composition, a 
liquid crystal device, a display apparatus and a 
display method, and more particularly to a mesomorphic 
compound, a liquid crystal composition containing the 
mesomorphic compound with improved responsiveness to 
an electric field, a liquid crystal device using the 
liquid crystal composition for use in a display 
device, a liquid crystal-optical shutter, etc., a 
display apparatus using the device, and a display 
method of using the composition and device. Hitherto, liquid crystal devices have been 
used as an electro-optical device in various fields. 
Most liquid crystal devices which have been put into 
practice use TN (twisted nematic) type liquid 
crystals, as shown in "Voltage-Dependent Optical 
Activity of a Twisted Nematic Liquid Crystal" by M. 
Schadt and W. Helfrich "Applied Physics Letters" Vol. 
18, No. 4 (Feb. 15, 1971) pp. 127-128. These devices are based on the dielectric 
alignment effect of a liquid crystal and utilize an 
effect that the average molecular axis direction is  
 
directed to a specific direction in response to an 
applied electric field because of the dielectric 
anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules. It is said 
that the limit of response speed is on the order of 
µsec, which is too slow for many uses. On the other 
hand, a simple matrix system of driving is most 
promising for application to a large-area flat display 
in view of cost, productivity, etc., in combination. 
In the simple matrix system, an electrode arrangement 
wherein scanning electrodes and signal electrodes are 
arranged in a matrix, and for driving, a multiplex 
driving scheme is adopted wherein an address signal is 
sequentially, periodically and selectively applied to 
the scanning electrodes and prescribed data signals 
are selectively applied in parallel to the signal 
electrodes in synchronism with the address signal. When the above-mentioned TN-type liquid 
crystal is used in a device of such a driving system, 
a certain electric field is applied to regions where a 
scanning electrode is selected and signal electrodes 
are not selected (or regions where a scanning 
electrode is not selected and a signal electrode is 
selected), which regions are called "half-selected 
points". If the difference between a voltage applied 
to the selected points and a voltage applied to the 
half-selected points is sufficiently large, and a 
voltage threshold level required for allowing liquid  
 
crystal molecules to be
