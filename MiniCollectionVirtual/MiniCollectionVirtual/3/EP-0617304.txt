<ABSTRACT>
The cassette arrangement for connecting and branching telecommunication and data transmission optical fibres comprises a plurality of cassettes (1,2,3), which are modular or modularly connectable so as to be stackable to each other to form a block, in the form of splice (splicer) cassettes (1) and/or coupling cassettes (2) and/or excess length cassettes (3); the cassettes being mutually and/or together with lid parts (4) unfoldable via hinge means (5) and connected to each other in a lockable manner, the cassettes serving to accommodate coupler modules (2') and/or splice modules (1') or the excess length cassettes to accommodate an insertable radius limiter (6); and both the bundle tube (7) and the switching tubes (switching wires) (8) running essentially tangentially with respect to the inner working reserve loops of the buffered fibres and, in addition, it being possible for the switching tubes (8) to be transferred internally or externally from one cassette into the other.
