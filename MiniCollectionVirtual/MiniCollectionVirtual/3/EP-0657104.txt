<ABSTRACT>
Thermodynamically stable transparent edible water-in-oil 
microemulsion comprising up to 33% of water, 0.1-30% of a 

diacylglyceride having one strong polar hydrophillic 
group, 0.1-30% of a mono-acylglyceride and oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an edible water-in-oil 
microemulsion. For incorporating water and polar ingredients into edible 
oils emulsions can be used, usually resulting in cloudy or 
opaque products, although stable, clear liquids can be 
obtained by making microemulsions using a well selected 
combination of oils, polar liquids and surfactants. 
US-A-5,045,337 describes edible W/O microemulsions using 
polyglycerolesters as surfactants, whereby up to 5% water 
can be incorporated into the microemulsion, although in the 
examples only 1% water is used. Attempts to incorporate 
more water resulted in not completely stable 
microemulsions.
 
It would be desirable to make more stable microemulsions, 
having the possibility of incorporating more water and/or 
other polar ingredients and to use other surfactants being 
generally acceptable in the food industry.
 
The invention provides thereto a thermodynamically stable 
transparent edible water-in-oil microemulsion comprising 
one or more oils, oil-soluble surfactants and polar 
ingredients characterized by up to 33% water and a 
surfactant comprising 0.1-30% of a diacylglyceride 
selected from the group of phospholipids and diacylglycerideesters 
selected from the group of citrates, tartrates and lactilates and 
0.1-30% of a monoacylglyceride. In general these diacylglycerides 
have a strong polar hydrophillic group. Preferably the acylgroups in the surfactants are roughly of 
the same character as the bulk of the acyl groups present 
in the triacylglycerides forming the oil of the 
microemulsion. Particularly preferred diacylglyceride surfactants being 
phoopholipids and preferred monoacylglycerides being those  
 
having acylgroups with 8-18 carbon atoms. 
Monoacylglycerides having unsaturated acylchains are in 
particular preferred. It does not need explanation that all ingredients of the 
emulsions should be edible. Similarly the oil or oil 
mixture should preferably be refined As stated before the microemulsions can in practice contain 
up to about 33% of water. When trying to increase this 
amount the emulsion turns turbid. The lower level of water 
cannot practically be defined: any amount of water over the 
amount which is soluble in the oil-surfactant mixture will 
result in a microemulsion on mixing. Dependent on the amount of aqueous phase the amount of oil 
phase can vary from 20 to 99.8%. In this specification and claims all percentages refer to 
weights unless otherwise indicated. Both pure and naturally occurring mixtures of lecithins and 
m
