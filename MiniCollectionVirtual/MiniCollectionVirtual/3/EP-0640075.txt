<DESCRIPTION>
 Certain Aminomethyl Phenylimidazole Derivatives; A New Class of Dopamine Receptor Subtype Specific LigandsBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to certain aminomethyl phenylimidazole derivatives which selectively bind to brain dopamine receptor subtypes. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. It further relates to the use of such compounds in treating affective disorders such as schizophrenia and depression as well as certain movement disorders such as Parkinsonism. Furthermore compounds of this invention may be useful in treating the extraparamidyl side effects asssociated with the use of conventional neuroleptic agents. The interaction of aminomethyl phenylimidazole derivatives of the invention with dopamine receptor subtypes is described. This interaction results in the pharmacological activities of these compounds.Descr.Piion of the Related ArtSchizophrenia or psychosis is a term used to describe a group of illnesses of unknown origin which affect approximately 2.5 million people in the United States. These disorders of the brain are characterised by a variety of symptoms which are classified as positive symptoms (disordered thought, hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal and unresponsiveness). These disorders have an age of onset in adolescence or early adulthood and persist for many years. The disorders tend to become more severe during the patients lifetime and can result in prolonged institutionalization. In the US today, approximately 40% of all hospitalized psychiatric patents suffer from schizophrenia.During the 1950's physicians demonstrated that they could sucessfully treat psychotic patients with medications called neuroleptics; this classification of antipsychotic medicatin was based largely on the activating (neuroleptic) properties of the nervous system by these drugs. Subsequently, neuroleptic agents were shown to increase the concentrations of dopamine metabolites in the brain suggesting altered neuronal firing of the dopamine system. Additional evidence indicated that dopamine could increase the activity of adenylate cyclase in the corpus striatum. an effect reversed by neuroleptic agents. Thus, cumulative evidence from these and later 

 experiments strongly suggested that the neurotransmitter dopamine was involved in schizophrenia.One of the major actions of antipsychotic medication is the blockade of dopamine receptors in brain. Several dopamine systems appear to exist
