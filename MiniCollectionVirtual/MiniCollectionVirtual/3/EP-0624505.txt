<ABSTRACT>
Wheel set guide of a bogie (1), consisting of the helical spring (6), arranged individually or in pairs on a bearing housing of a wheel set (5), of the primary suspension and a rubber element (7) which is arranged individually or in pairs, the wheel set being guided jointly by the flexicoil effect of the helical springs (6) and the radial rigidity of the rubber element (7).

<CLAIMS>
A wheel set guide for a bogie (1), comprising a 
helical spring (6) or primary suspension system arranged 

singly or in pairs on an axle box housing (5) of a wheel 
set, and a rubber element (7) arranged singly or in 

pairs, the guidance of the wheel set being jointly 
achieved by the flexicoil effect of the helical spring(s) 

(6) and the radial rigidity of the rubber element (7), 
and the rubber element (7) exhibiting differences in the 

longitudinal and transverse guidance characteristic 
through the formation of air chambers (10
) positioned 
locally, 
characterised
 in that arranging the air chambers 
(10) at a predetermined angle in the rubber element (7) 

enables radial adjustment of the wheel set in dependence 
on the centrifugal force to be achieved. 
A wheel set guide for a bogie according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the rubber element (7) is a 

prestressed, concentrically-arranged conical element. 
A wheel set guide for a bogie according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the compressive prestressing of the 

rubber element (7) is produced by the unladen weight of 
the vehicle, and the cone angle is selected such that no 

tensile stresses occur in the rubber element (7) in any 
operating condition.  

 
A wheel set guide for a bogie according to any 
preceding claim, characterised in that the rubber element 

(7) is mounted beneath the primary suspension system on 
or in the axle box housing (5), in a cavity (12) for 

example, and is connected to a downwardly-projecting 
auxiliary guide pin (8) of the bogie frame (2). 
A wheel set guide for a bogie according to Claim 1 
or any of the following claims, characterised in that the 

angular position of the rubber element (7) is fixed by 
way of a groove in the outer ring thereof and a threaded 

pin in a cavity (12) in the axle box housing (5). 
A wheel set guide for a bogie according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that several tapped holes are provided 

in the cavity (12), staggered vertically and each having 
a different angular position, and these tapped holes 

thereby permit easy subsequent adjustment to changing 
operating conditions. 
A wheel set guide for a bogie according to Claim 1 
or any of the following claims, characterised in that the 

air chambers (10) are arranged rotated by an angle of 
between 5 degrees and 60 degrees to the longitudinal axis 

of the bogie (1).
