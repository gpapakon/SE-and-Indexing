<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to graphitization
of cast iron, and particularly to a process for
graphitizing cast iron during graphitization of a white
pig iron structure in a malleable cast iron casting,
which process can shorten the annealing time, and improve
the mechanical properties, of the casting.Since malleable cast iron has good castability
and becomes as ductile and as tough as cast steel, it is
very useful as a mechanical structure material.
Malleable cast iron is classified into whiteheart
malleable cast iron, blackheart malleable cast iron, cast
iron having a specified matrix, and the like. Among
these cast irons, the blackheart malleable cast iron has
a white pig iron structure as a malleable cast iron in an
as-cast state. Since the casting is hard and brittle, it
is graphitized by annealing in the production process
thereof.Though the time and the temperature of
annealing conditions are determined by taking many
casting factors into consideration, the annealing usually
includes two steps. The first annealing step is carried
out at 900 to 980°C for 10 to 20 hours, and free
cementite is completely decomposed thereby. The second
annealing step includes, in combination, slow cooling in
the temperature range of 700 to 760°C for the purpose of
direct graphitization and treatment over a long period of
time in the temperature range of 700 to 730°C for the
purpose of graphitizing cementite in the pearlite in the
casting. As described above, both annealing steps
usually take from about 20 to 100 hours to perform.
Particularly, heating to the annealing temperature takes 
about 10 to 20 hours ("refer to Cast Steel and Cast
Iron", 1970, page 254 - 257, Published by Asakurashoten).As described above, graphitizing a malleable
cast iron casting takes a long time and, as a result,
productivity is low. Since the surface layer of the
casting is oxidized and decarburized by heating over a
long period of time, atmospheric heating is required to
inhibit the phenomena. As a result, there arises a
problem in that the treatment cost increases.Moreover, in the process of graphitization, it
is important to prevent the formation of a defective
product caused by the formation of a defective structure
or of flake graphite due to incomplete annealing caused
by an inappropriate annealing cycle, namely, a low
annealing temperature or an insufficient treating time.Furthermore, a graphitized structure obtained
by conventional treatment tends to have graphite which
has not been sufficiently spheroidization refined even
thoug
