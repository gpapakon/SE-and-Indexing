<ABSTRACT>
Boric acid is incorporated by mixing into a dispersion which can be applied by spraying and is based on an acrylate copolymer and a colloidal chloroprene polymer, the content of boric acid preferably being from 0.1 to 10% by weight relative to the solids content. The sprayed material is applied to at least one or to both the substrate surfaces to be bonded, which are placed against one another while still wet and subjected to a pressure of at least 0.1 N/cm
<

>
 for at least about 0.5 sec. The sprayable dispersion is preferably employed for the adhesive bonding of foam materials; a short period of subjection to pressure gives an initial adhesion which is so high that further processing or transportation can be commenced immediately.

<CLAIMS>
A sprayable dispersion containing an acrylic acid ester 
copolymer and a colloidal chloroprene polymerizate,
 
characterized in that
 
it contains boric acid. 
A dispersion to Claim 1, characterized in that it has at 
a weight ratio of the acrylic acid ester copolymer to 

the chloroprene polymerizate of perferably 1:10 to 
1,5:1, particularly about 1:1, a boric acid content of 

1,0 to 10% by weight, based on the solids content. 
A dispersion to Claim 2, characterized in that it has a 
boric acid proportion of 0,5 to 5% by weight, preferably 

1 to 2% by weight. 
A dispersion to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that it contains sodium lauric sulfate, preferably 0,1 

to 3% by weight. 
A dispersion to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that it contains an N-alkyl pyrrolidon, preferably N-methyl-2-pyrrolidon 

up to 15% by weight, and/or a 
component of the group consisting of N-octyl-2-pyrrolidon 

and N-dodecyl-2-pyrrolidon, preferably 
each of up to 10% by weight, always based on the solids 

content. 
A dispersion to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that it contains dimethylphtalat or diisobutylphtalat, 

preferably each up to 20% by weight, based on the solids 
content.  

 
A process for elastic bonding of two substrate 
surfaces, at least one of which is porous, with a 

dispersion as specified in Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the dispersion is sprayed to at least one substrate 

surface, the substrate surfaces to be bonded are placed 
in a wet condition on top of one another and are pressed 

together for a minimum of approx. 0,5 seconds with a 
pressure of at least 0,1 N/cm2. 
A process to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
dispersion is sprayed or atomized, preferably with an 

air pressure of 0,5 to 1,5 bar and a material inlet 
pressure of 0,3 to 0,6 bar. 
A process to Claims 7 or 8, characterized in that the 
sprayed dispersion is flashed off 0 to 60 min before 

being layed and pressed together, preferably for 0 to 30 
min. 
A process to one of Claims 7 to 9, characterized in that 
the wet substrate surfaces to be bonded are pressed 

together at least once for 1 to 5 sec, preferably at a 
pressure of 0,2 to 1 N/cm
