<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method 
for extracting cholesterol from egg yolk. In accordance 

with the method, the mixture of egg yolk solids, water 
and oil is provided. The mixture is then subjected to 

high shear homogenization by pumping the mixture through 
homogenizing apparatus capable of generating pressures of 

up to about 18,000 psig (about 1242.13 bar). The mixture is then separated 
into water and oil phases by centrifugation to provide an 

oil phase which retains the cholesterol and a water phase 
which contains the egg solids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
reducing the amount of cholesterol in egg yolk. More 
particularly, the present invention is directed to a 
decholesterolization process for egg yolk which utilizes 
high pressure, high impact homogenization. Because of the desirability of egg yolk and a 
large number of applications of egg yolk in foods, 
substantial research effort has been directed to removal 
of cholesterol from egg yolks, as well as food products 
which include these materials as ingredients. Egg yolk 
contains a high level of cholesterol and saturated fats 
and is itself an emulsion comprising a dispersion of oil 
droplets in a continuous phase of aqueous components. It 
has a total solid content of approximately 50% to 52%, 
composed of 15.5% to 16.5% protein, 31.5% to 34.5% lipid, 
0.5% to 1.5% carbohydrate and 0.9% to 1.2% ash. The egg 
yolk lipids comprise as their main components 
approximately 65% triglyceride, 29% phospholipid and 5% 
cholesterol. There is almost universal agreement among 
physicians and dieticians that the intake of cholesterol 
and saturated fats, which are prevalent in western 
country diets, should be reduced. Because of the high 
level of cholesterol in egg yolks, substantial research 
effort and many patents have been directed to the removal 
of cholesterol from egg yolks. Generally, three approaches have been taken for 
removal of cholesterol from egg yolk. Early efforts, 
such as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 3,563,765 to 
Melnick, utilized a non-polar solvent, such as hexane, to 
extract cholesterol from dried egg yolk. U.S. Patent No. 
4,234,619 to Yano, et al. is also directed to removal of  
 
cholesterol from egg yolk with a solvent, liquid dimethyl 
ether. The extraction of cholesterol from egg yolk is 
discussed in "Extraction and Processing of Various 
Components from Egg Yolk", Larson, et al., published as 
Paper No. 5984, Journal Series, Nebraska Agricultural 
Station, Lincoln, in N.E. 68583, April 21, 1980. The 
Larson, et al. reference describes an extraction 
procedure to separate lipid, aqueous and protein 
fractions from egg yolk utilizing various solvents. The 
solvents used were ethanol, isopropanol, hexane-ethyl 
alcohol, and hexane-isopropyl alcohol. U.S. Patent No. 
4,104,286 to Fallis describes a process for isolating 
cholesterol from dried whole egg and dried egg yolk which 
includes extraction with aqueous ethanol, saponification 
in aqueous ethanolic alkali metal hydroxide and 
concentration and purification with a hydrocarbon

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing cholesterol from egg yolk 
comprising providing a homogeneous mixture of egg yolk 

solids, water and vegetable oil by low shear mixing and 
subjecting said mixture to high pressure homogenization so 

as to transfer a major amount of the cholesterol in said egg 
yolk to said vegetable oil. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said high 
pressure homogenization is at a pressure of at least 4,500 

psig (at least 311.29 bar). 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 

said high pressure homogenization is at a pressure of at 
least 9,000 psig (at least 621.57 bar). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein said high pressure homogenization is at a pressure 

of from about 10,000 psig to about 15,000 psig (about 690.52 
bar to about 1035.28 bar). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein said premix has from about 10% to about 32% egg yolk 

solids, from about 35% to about 85% vegetable oil and from 
about 10% to about 35% water.
