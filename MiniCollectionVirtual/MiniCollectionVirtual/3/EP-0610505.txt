<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating and regenerating a high-load and high-concentration wash waste liquid (50), which is discharged 
from a washing stage (20) and a rinsing stage, by vacuum distillation. In a washing method and a washing apparatus, a multitank-connected 

type rinsing tank unit (31) in which a plurality of tanks are connected so that a rinse liquid (32) is sent in order in 
a direction opposite to the direction in which a material to be washed is transferred is used. A wash waste liquid (50) discharged 

from a rinsing tank (31c) positioned at the most downstream side of the multitank-connected type rinsing tank unit (31) is vacuum 
distilled, and a condensate (54) obtained is recycled to a rinsing tank (31a) positioned at the most upstream side of the tank 

unit. The vacuum distillation is carried out in the presence of, for example, a silicone defoaming agent (61) or a silicone defoaming 
component. The vacuum distillation is also carried out as a wash waste liquid is allowed to flow down along a heated wall 

surface to form a film of the liquid thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
regenerating a spent detergent or rinse, an apparatus for 
regenerating the spent detergent, and a method for cleaning 
and an apparatus for cleaning by the use of the product of the 
regeneration. Metallic parts, plated parts, coated parts, electronic 
parts, semiconductor parts and various other similar parts, 
while undergoing the process of manufacture or assemblage, are 
prone to gather on their surfaces various defiling substances 
centering on machining oil and dust. It has been heretofore 
customary for such defiled parts as these to be cleaned with 
Flon type solvents and chlorine type solvents. The Flon type 
solvents and chlorine type solvents contain chlorine. Since 
it has been demonstrated that these chlorine-containing 
compounds destroy the ozonosphere, however, measures have been 
adopted to repress or even abolish completely the use of these 
Flon type solvents and chlorine type solvents. Under the 
circumstances, the review of the currently prevalent process 
of cleaning has become an urgent necessity. The feasibility of using aqueous type detergents such as, 
for example, aqueous solutions of saponifying agents and 
surfactants in the place of the aforementioned Flon type 
solvents and chlorine type solvents is now being studied. 
Unlike the organic type solvents, the aqueous type detergents  
 
have a good prospect of fulfilling various kinds of cleaning 
because they permit construction of a nonflammable cleaning 
system and they are enabled to manifest a high degreasing 
ability by the use of a suitably selected alkali or 
surfactant. Since they necessitate use of water for rinsing, 
they inevitably entail the problem of safely disposing of the 
rinsing, a residue which never occurs in the cleaning as with 
a solvent. Incidentally, the activated sludge method, the activated 
carbon adsorption method, the ion exchange method, the 
membrane separation method, and various combinations of the 
methods mentioned above have been heretofore adopted for the 
disposal of plant effluents. Theme conventional methods of 
disposal, however, entail the problem of necessitating heavy 
investment of capital in facilities and complicate maintenance 
and management of equipment. Further, the aforementioned 
methods of disposal invariably fail to allow easy direct 
disposal of so-called high-load plant effluents which manifest 
BOD, COD, n-hexane extracts, pH, and SS at high levels. In 
this case, such plant effluents must be diluted with water of 
a
