<ABSTRACT>
An electrical protection device (17) has a protective functional unit (1) which has a top side (4) and, lying outside the latter, input connections (20) and output connections (21) for an electrical power line. In this case, the protective functional units (1) can be used for electrical devices of various types with different electrical power demands. A mounting plate (2) is arranged on the top side (4) of the protective functional unit (1). Fastening devices (13, 15) are provided, using which at least one central plate of a telephone socket cover can be fitted on the mounting plate (2).

<CLAIMS>
An electrical safety device, with a protective operating 
unit (1), which has a top (4) and, disposed outside the latter, 

input and output connectors (20, 21) for an electrical output 
performance,
 
in which arrangement, protective operating units (1) can be used 

for various electrical appliances with different electrical output 
performance requirements,
 
   characterized in that 


a mounting plate (2) is arranged at the top (4) of the protective 
operating unit (1), and 
that fastening devices (7, 13, 14, 15) are provided, by means of 
which at least one central plate (6) of a telephone socket cover 

(12, 22) can be attached to the mounting plate (2). 
An electrical safety device according to claim 1,
 
   characterized in that
 
the protective operating unit (1) does not have any connector 

sockets for electrical appliances. 
An electrical safety device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
   characterized in that 


the protective operating unit (1) contains overvoltage safety 
devices (18) and/or mains filter devices (19) which are designed 

in particular as modules, and 
that in particular the modules can be connected to one another 
directly and/or by means of connecting leads. 
An electrical safety device according to claim 3,
 
   characterized in that 


the overvoltage safety devices (18) comprise an electronic unit 
which has in particular a safety circuit, preferably with two 

varistors and an overvoltage arrester, and a monitoring circuit, 
in particular with at least one optical display device, preferably 

a fault indicator, and/or the mains filter devices (19) 
contain a mains filter, and  

 
that in particular at least one exchangeable overload fuse is 
provided. 
An electrical safety device according to one of the preceding 
claims.
 
   characterized in that 


the central plate (6) is a TAE-cover (22), wherein an opening 
(5) is provided, 
that the protective operating unit (1) comprises an indicator 
unit (3) arranged at its top, (4) corresponding to the opening 

(5) in the central plate (6), and 
that the indicator unit (3) preferably contains optical devices 
for displaying the functional and/or operational state of the 

protective operating unit (1) or parts thereof. 
An electrical safety device according to claim 5,
 
   characterized in that
 
the indicator unit (3) has a display field (3') whose dimensions 

and contour correspond at least substantially to the dimensions 
and the contour of the opening (5) provided in the TAE-cover 

(22), and that the display field (3') preferably fills the 
opening (5) with a flush fit. 
An electrical safety device according to one of the preceding 
claims.
 
   characterized in that
 
the central plate (6) is a blind cover (12) or a telephone cover 

for a telephone connection fixed in position, and that preferably 
the protective operating unit (1) is of such a size that it 

can be covered by two central plates (6), in which arrangement 
in particular, one central plate (6) is a TAE-cover (22), and 

the other a blind cover or a telephone cover for a telephone 
connection fixed in position.  

 
An electrical safety device according to one of the 
preceding claims,
 
   characterized in that 


the protective operating unit (1) and/or the mounting plate (2) 
have or has at least one tapped bore (13, 15), 
that the central plate (6) has for assembly a holding bore 
aligned with the tapped bore (13, 15), and 
that a screw (7, 14) can be screwed in through the holding bore 
into the tapped bore (13, 15), in which arrangement the screw 

head is larger than the free diameter of the holding bore in the 
central plate (6), so that the central plate (6) can be pressed 

by the screw head against the mounting plate (2) as the screw 
(7, 14) is being screwed in into the tapped bore (13,15), and in 

which arrangement the tapped bore (13, 15) has a corresponding 

screw length and an additional free length if required, so that 
the screw (7, 14) can be screwed in so far that the central 

plate (6) is pressed firmly against the mounting plate (2), and 
that the holding bore preferably has a countersunk recess for 

receiving the screw head. 
An electrical safety device according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
   characterized in that 


an intermediate plate (9) surrounding the central plate (6) and/ 
or a frame plate (10) is or are provided, and 
that preferably the frame plate (10) is held by the central 
plate (6), if required via the intermediate plate (9), when the 

central plate has been secured relative to the mounting plate 
(2), and/or 
that preferably a common multiple frame is provided in the case 
of several central plates (6). 
An electrical safety device according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
   characterized in that
 
for the installation in electrical installation systems or  

 
parapet duct systems, and/or energy columns and/or in flush 

installation sockets, in particular installed double appliance 
sockets, if required for a larger protective operating unit (1),

suitable fastening devices is provided for attachment on top of 

surfaces. 
Use of a central plate of a telephone socket cover (12, 22) 
in an electrical safety device (17) according to one of the preceding 

claims.
