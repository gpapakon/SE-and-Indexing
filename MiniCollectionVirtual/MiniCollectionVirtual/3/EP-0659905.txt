<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plasma CVD
(Chemical Vapor Deposition) device used to deposit thin
films of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and the like on a
substrate.Generally, hydrogenated amorphous silicon
(hereinafter, expressed as a-Si:H) in which silicon atoms
and hydrogen have been bonded together is deposited on a
substrate of a glass plate or the like laminated with a
metal or other electrical conductors or transparent
electrically conductive films, for applications to solar
cells, photoconductive drums, various sensors, thin film
transistors, and the like. As the method of depositing a-Si:H
onto the substrate, available are the plasma CVD
process using glow discharge, the reactive sputtering
process, and the like. Among others, the plasma CVD
process is widely adopted as the process for fabricating a-Si:H
films by virtue of its capability of depositing a-Si:H
thin films having excellent film characteristics. The plasma CVD device used for carrying out the
plasma CVD process has an electrode for holding the
substrate and a high frequency application electrode
arranged opposite to and parallel to the electrode. In the
plasma CVD device, when high frequency power is applied
between the two electrodes, glow discharge is generated. A
material gas is previously introduced between the two
electrodes. The introduced material gas is decomposed by
the glow discharge, so that an a-Si:H film is deposited on
the substrate held by the electrode.In such a plasma CVD device, generally, an a-Si:H
film is deposited with RF (radio frequency) power set as
low as 0.05 W/cm2 so that the film forming rate will be
around 0.5 to 2 Å/sec under the conditions of a 0.1 - 0.3
Torr film forming pressure and an around 200°C substrate
temperature. The a-Si:H film fabricated in this way, when
not doped, shows good characteristic values including an
optical band gap of around 1.7 eV, a photoconductivity of
around 1 × 10-4 S/cm, and a dark conductivity of around 1 ×
10-10 S/cm.When an a-Si:H film is deposited on the substrate
by the plasma CVD device, it is practically preferable to
fabricate the film at the fastest possible rate under such
conditions that a photoconductivity of 1 × 10-5 S/cm or
more, at which fabricated a-Si:H films show less 
deterioration of characteristics, can be obtained. That
is, the faster the film forming rate is, the more the
fabrication time of a-Si:H films can be reduced so that the
production efficiency is improved. As a result, the
fabrication cost of the a-Si:H films can be reduced. For
this
