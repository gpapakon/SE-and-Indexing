<ABSTRACT>
Method for increasing the enantioselectivity in the enzymatic separation of the (R) and (S) enantiomers of an asymmetric alkynol in the presence of a lipase by use of at least one vinyl ester in which the acid component has at least 4 C atoms, where appropriate of an organic solvent and, where appropriate, of water and a method for increasing the selectivity in the enzymatic separation of the R and S enantiomers of an optically active alcohol with the aid of the abovementioned vinyl ester as esterifying agent with the addition of a catalytic amount of a vinyl ester which has at least two C atoms less in the alkyl chain than the vinyl ester used as esterifying agent.

<CLAIMS>
Process for enhancing enantioselectivity in an
enzymatic process for the separation of the (R)- and

(S)-enantiomers of an asymmetric alkynol of the formula

R - C â‰¡ C - CH(OH) - R
1

in which R and R
1
 independently of each other denote
alkyl groups having 1 to 10 C atoms and in which R

additionally denotes hydrogen, in the presence of a
lipase and in the presence of a vinyl ester as

esterifiying agent, characterized in that the
esterifying agent used comprises at least one vinyl

ester of the formula

CH
2
 = CH - O - CO - R
2

in which R
2
 denotes an alkyl group having at least 3 C
atoms, to which is added a catalytic amount of a vinyl

ester of the formula II which has at least two C atoms
fewer in the alkyl chain than that vinyl ester which is

used as esterifying agent.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
an organic solvent is added to the reaction mixture in

an amount of 0.1 to 60 vol. % based on the entire
reaction mixture.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the organic solvent used is an aliphatic,

halogenated hydrocarbon or an aromatic hydrocarbon.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that water is added to the reaction

mixture in an amount of 0.05 to 0.5 vol. % based on the
entire reaction mixture. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized by the use of a compound of the formula I

according to Claim 1 where R and R
1
 independently of
each other denote an alkyl group having 1 to 8 C atoms

and R additionally denotes hydrogen.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized by the use of a compound of the formula I

according to Claim 1 where R denotes hydrogen.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized by the use of a compound of the formula

II according to Claim 1 where R
2
 denotes a straight-chain
alkyl group having 3 to 15 C atoms.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that a lipase from a microorganism of

the genus Pseudomonas or Candida is used.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the reaction mixture is separated

by distillation after the reaction has ended.
