<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device in a
homodyne receiver to be used in radio, tele, and data
communication systems such as portable cellular phones,
cordless phones, pagers, carrier frequency systems, TV
cable systems, etc. Receivers in this technical field
should preferably be small, lightweight and inexpensive.The first generation of cellular systems relied on
analogue frequency modulation for speech transmission,
and several standards have been developed, such as
NMT450, NMT900, AMPS, and ETACS.The second generation of cellular systems follows
three different standards: in Europe and some countries
in Asia and Australia - Global System For Mobile Communications
(GSM), in north America - American Digital Cellular
(ADC), and in Japan - Pacific Digital Cellular (PDC).
These systems all employ digital voice transmission and
some digital services such as facsimile transmission and
short messages.To make the portables smaller and less expensive
much research has been done to increase the level of
integration of different parts in the phone.Prior art receivers that have been used in this
technical field were of the conventional heterodyne type.
For applications in small low cost mobile communication
systems these receivers suffer from high production costs
caused by expensive and non-integrable RF and IF
components such as band pass filters. To overcome such
drawbacks alternative receivers have been developed.
These receivers are based on the direct conversion
principle. The local oscillator frequency is equal to the
received carrier frequency. 
This concept was first introduced for SSB-receivers
but can be used in many different types of modulation,
particularly for digital quadrature modulation schemes.In a homodyne receiver or a zero-IF-receiver the
received signal and the local oscillator operate at
exactly the same frequency. Since there are no intermediate
frequencies (IF) many filters can be omitted or
simplified. The operation of the homodyne receiver can be
described as follows. The RF signal of centre fc and
bandwith BWrf is amplified with a low noise amplifier to
improve the total noise figure of the receiver. The
signal is then split and down converted to DC by mixers
in both channels. The down converted spectrum is folded
over itself and spans from DC to 1/2 BWrf. The low
frequency signals I and Q provided by the mixers are then
filtered to remove any adjacent channel and amplified to
set the noise floor. The I and Q signals or the quadrature
signals will allow basically any type
