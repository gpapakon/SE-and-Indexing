<ABSTRACT>
The motor-cycle frame (11) is connected in a stable manner to the sidecar frame (12). A wheel carrier (2), which here replaces the fork, can be turned laterally for steering purposes. This wheel carrier (2) is coupled in its upper region by means of a longitudinal control arm (3) in vertically movable fashion to the motor-cycle frame (11), whereas in its lower region it is coupled by means of a transverse control arm (4) in vertically movable fashion to a frame member (121) which is connected to the motor-cycle frame (11) and to the sidecar frame (12). As a result, it is possible for the lateral forces, and also for the longitudinal forces, to be very readily picked up approximately in the centre of the wheel and to be diverted onto the low-lying motor-cycle frame (11).

Sidecar-motorbike (1) with the motorbike frame (11)
connected firmly with the sidecar frame (12) and provided

with a laterally swivelling wheel support (2) for steering
purpose which on its upper part is hinged movable in altitude

to the motorbike frame (11) by means of a longitudinal guide
rod (3), characterized in that the wheel support (2) is

hinged on its lower part by means of a cross guide rod (4) to
a frame support (121), which is connected to the motorbike

frame (11) and the sidecar frame (12).
Sidecar-motorbike according to claim 1, characterized in
that the cross guide rod (4) is constructed as a triangular

guide rod.
Sidecar-motorbike according to claim 2, characterized in
that triangular shaped cross guide rods (4) are hinged by

means of ball-and-socket shaped joints (122; 22) to the frame
support (121) and wheel support (2).
Sidecar-motorbike according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the frame support (121) is constructed

as a connecting member between the sidecar frame (12) and the
motorbike frame (11). 
Sidecar-motorbike according to claim 4, characterized in
that the frame support (121) is projecting longitudinally to

the front.
Sidecar-motorbike according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the wheel support (2) is connected

above his longitudinal guide rod bearing (21) by means of a
telescopic guidance (23) to the control lever (24).
