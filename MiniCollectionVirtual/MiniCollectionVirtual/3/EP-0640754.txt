<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine 
comprising a plurality of intake valves (11,12) including at least one 

center intake valve (11) and intake passages (3,9,10) associated 
therewith. 

The intake passage (9) associated with the center intake valve (11) has 
on its upper inside a flattened surface (9a) having a substantially 

straight slope for directing the flow of the intake charge 
downwards towards the centre axis (c) of the cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an internal combustion engine
comprising at least one cylinder with a combustion chamber
defined therein, at least three intake valves including at least
one centre intake valve and two side intake valves and intake
passages associated therewith for delivering an intake charge to
said combustion chamber wherein the intake passage associated
with the centre intake valve has on its upper end side a
flattened surface having a substantially straight slope for
directing the flow of the intake charge downwards towards the
central axis of the cylinder.In the prior art, the air intake device for engines having three air intake valves
per cylinder were configured, for example, as disclosed in Japan Patent Application Sho
63-256000 (1988). This air intake device of the prior art featured air intake valves aligned
within a concentric circle with respect to the cylinder bore and these were operated by
a common camshaft. Because of this arrangement, the side air intake valves, with
respect to the center, exhibited a relatively large angle of slope between the axial center line of the
center intake valve and the cylinder bore axis.In addition, the air intake passages were directed to the vicinity of the combustion
chamber and formed so that they could be opened and closed by the air intake valves.
The passages were curved so that they led to the side of the cylinder head from the area
of the combustion chamber. The two side air intake passages are formed at a relatively
large angle with respect to cylinder bores when viewed in the axial camshaft direction.
In other words, compared with the central air intake passage, the two side air intake
passages had a greater angle of slope with respect to the cylinder bore when viewed in
the axial camshaft direction. Also, the inside diameter of the three air intake passages
was roughly equivalent. With the above-configured air intake device of the prior art, when intake air is
sucked into the combustion chamber from the three air intake passages, a vertical swirl
is created inside the cylinder around a line that is parallel to the axis of the camshaft,
so that fuel being supplied with the air is roughly uniformly distributed throughout the
cylinder for efficient ignition. This type swirling flow will be called "tumble" below.The reason why this tumbling action is generated within the cylinder is that there
is a large angle of slope of each of the air intake passages with respect to the air intake
valves. To wit, the inertia of the air flowing
