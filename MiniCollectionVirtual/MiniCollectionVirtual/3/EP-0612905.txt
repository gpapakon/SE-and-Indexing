<ABSTRACT>
The hinge (100) for doors, windows or the like comprises a frame hinge part (10) and a leaf/sash hinge part (20). The invention provides a covering strip (50, 50') which extends along the gap (26) between the hinge parts (10, 20) and covers over said gap. The covering strip (50, 50') engages over one of the hinge parts (10, 20) with one longitudinal border abutting on the outside, such that said hinge part can be shifted vertically with respect to the covering strip (50, 50'), has a width which corresponds at least to the adjustment travel of the hinge parts (10, 20) with respect to one another, and is connected to the other hinge part (20, 10) along the other longitudinal border.

Hinge for doors, windows or the like,

with a frame hinge member 10, 10' for attachment to the front
face (38) of the fixed frame (1) of the door, window or the like,
with a flap hinge member (20) for attachment to the front face (39)
of the flap (2), the door, the window or the like,
with a vertical hinge pin (8) which extends through superimposed
eye portions (11, 12, 13) of the hinge members (10, 10'; 20) for pivotally

connecting together the hinge members (10, 10'; 20) to hinge them together,
a gap being present between a horizontal bounding plane (16, 17) of the eye

portion (13) of the flap hinge member (20) and a horizontal bounding
plane (15, 18), facing towards this bounding plane (16, 17), of the eye

portion (11, 12) of the frame hinge member (10,10'), and each eye
portion (11-13) having an opening (19) for receiving the hinge pin (8),
with a device (22) achieving an adjusting stroke (36, 37) of the hinge
members (10, 10'; 20) relative to one another and altering the gap to adjust

the position in height of the flap hinge member (20) with respect to the
frame hinge member (10, 10'),
a hinge pin bush (30) adjustable in height by means of the
device (22) being arranged at least in the opening (19) in the frame hinge

member (10, 10') through which the hinge pin (8) passes, the hinge pin (8)
being seated in the bush, and the hinge pin bush (30) having a radial annular

portion (24) projecting into the gap and engaging the horizontal bounding
planes (16, 17) of the flap hinge member (20),
and at least the frame hinge member (10, 10') being bounded at least
in a region adjacent to the flap hinge member (20) by surfaces parallel to

the axis of the hinge pin (8),

   characterised in that, 

a collar (25) is integrally formed on the outer edge of the annular
portion (24),
forming a covering strip (50, 50') which extends along the gap
between the hinge members (10, 10'; 20) and covers it over,
which covering strips (50, 50') engage over the frame hinge
member (10,10';20) with a longitudinal edge (52) facing towards this

frame hinge member (10, 10'; 20) and directed substantially parallel to the
axis of the hinge pin, engaging from outside in such a way that the

longitudinal edge (52) is displaceable vertically with respect to the frame
hinge member (10, 10'; 20),
and has a width corresponding at least to the adjusting
travel (36, 37).
Hinge according to Claim 1, characterised in that it is in the
form of a strap hinge (100) and the frame hinge member (10) engages over

the flap hinge member (20) with a further eye portion (12) and a further
covering strip (50') according to Claim 1 is arranged at the gap (26)

between this eye portion (12) and the flap hinge member (20).
Hinge according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that on an
adjustment of the height position by raising the lower hinge pin bush a

device is provided by means of which the upper covering strip (50') is held
with its lower edge in engagement against the upper bounding face (17) of

the flap hinge member (20).
Hinge according to Claim 3, characterised in that the device
engages against the upper hinge pin bush (30) connected to the covering

strip (50'). 
Hinge according to Claim 4, characterised in that the device is
a spring (29) abutting against the upper eye portion (12) and pressing down

the upper hinge pin bush (30) against the flap hinge member (20).
Hinge according to Claim 7, characterised in that the device
comprises a projection engaging in a lateral groove in the hinge pin (8).
Hinge according to Claim 6, characterised in that the hinge
pin (8) has a circumferential groove (45) in the region of the upper hinge

pin bush (30) and the hinge pin bush (30) has a spring tongue (42) which
engages radially in the circumferential groove (45).
Hinge according to one of Claims 2 to 7, characterised in that
the further covering strip is made a mirror image of the first covering

strip (50) in relation to a horizontal plane.
Hinge according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that
the outside of the covering strip (50) has a profiled section.
