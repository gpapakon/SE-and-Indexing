<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW NOISE, LOW DISTORTION, COMPLEMENTARY IF AMPLIFIERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention:The present invention relates to electronic circuits and systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to intermediate frequency amplifiers used in communications receivers.Description of the Related Art:Power consumption is a critical consideration in the design and operation of electronic circuits and systems, particularly receivers used in communications systems. Conventionally, Class A amplifiers are used in communication receivers. Class A amplifiers use a single conductivity type transistor. In order to provide a signal current to a load, a large amount of direct (DC) current is required. This is due to the fact that in Class A amplifiers, the maximum load signal current is limited to the DC bias current. In push-pull operation, the load signal current is limited to twice the DC bias current. This is effectively the result of symmetric operation of two Class A stages in parallel. The load signal current is supplied by equal and opposite signal currents from the two Class A amplifiers in a push-pull action. Thus, the DC bias current for the push-pull amplifier can be one-half the DC bias current of the Class A amplifier to produce the same load signal current. As an example of this, if the load signal current is +1, this is generated by having the signal current of the upper class A PNP amplifier increase by +i/2, and the signal 

current of the lower Class A NPN amplifier decrease by +i/2, thereby creating the push- pull action.Unfortunately, Class A amplifiers consume a considerable amount of power to achieve current performance requirements for noise and third order intercept (distortion intermodulation products).Hence,- a need remains in the art for an improved amplifier design offering lower power consumption operating at intermediate (IF) frequencies from baseband to 150 megahertz.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention uses Class AB (push-pull) amplifiers, one in a higher voltage configuration and one in a lower voltage configuration, to achieve a high intercept at low power as well as a low noise figure. This complementary technology allows for higher performance at lower power.In the illustrative embodiment, the invention includes a first circuit for receiving an input signal; a second circuit for shifting a level of the input signal; and a third circuit for amplifying the input signal. In the illustrative embodiment, the third circuit includes first and second
