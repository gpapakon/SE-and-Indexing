<ABSTRACT>
An eddy current sensor for monitoring the metallization of apertures and narrow-gauge 
pipes comprises an axisymmetric 

body (1) elongated along the axis of symmetry, on the inner surface of which is mounted a coil in the form of a helical winding 
wound along the axis. The body (1) is hollow, the ratio of the outer cross section D to the inner cross section d being such that 

1.4 
<
 D/d 
<
 1.6; this, together with the fact that the coil (3) is mounted on the inner surface of the body (1), gives the coil 
greater mechanical strength and helps to protect it from damage without increasing the cross-sectional 

dimensions of the 
sensor. The internal space of the body (1) can be filled with a magnetoconductive material. It is expedient to provide inside the 

casing a central shaft (8) with a tapering plug at the end (7). The sensor is modified if there is a holder (6). The process for 
producing the sensor involves forming the coil on a dielectric elastic core (2) and producing the body (1) in its flat developed 

form; the casing is given its desired final shape after the core (2) with the coil (3) has been mounted on the casing when still 
flat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the non-destructive testing of workpiece
properties and, in particular, to eddy-current probes for the non-destructive
testing within pipes and holes in workpieces of a small diameter such as
testing the coating in the through-holes of printed circuit boards.Normally holes of printed circuit boards vary in diameter from 0.5 to 2.0 mm,
whereas thickness of coating in through-holes varies from 15 to 50 microns.
The material of electroplating is usually copper.There is not much prior art for testing within apertures of such small
dimensions. Known in the prior art is an eddy-current probe for non-destructive
testing of electrically conductive plating in holes of printed circuit
boards, comprising an oblong cylindrical core with excitation and measuring
coils enveloping said core, whose wires are stretched along the axis of said
core (US Patent No. 4,072,895). The known method for manufacturing said
probe consists of winding an insulated wire on the cylindrical body as its coil
(see, for example: Reference Manual Non-destructive Testing, edited by R.
McMaster, tr. from English, part 2, Moscow, Energy Publishers, 1965).In the prior art the conductors of the coils envelop the cylindrical core and
intersect at the butts or ends thereof. Winding such conductors is a delicate
job due to the minute dimensions of the core (less than 1 mm). With manual
winding performed with the aid of a microscope electrical characteristics of 
probes vary considerably. Moreover, conductors of the probe coils may be
easily damaged when the probe is inserted into a hole to be tested.Also known in the prior art is an eddy-current probe which is not so easily
damaged (see, for example, German Patent DE-A-3,050,497). This probe is
intended for non-destructive testing of metal coatings in pipes and holes in
workpieces and comprises a carrying cylindrical core and an enveloping coil
whose wires are stretched along the axis of the core. All the wires are secured
on in the lateral surface of the core. Said coil carries a special coating to be
protected from mechanical damage.Moreover, said patent describes the method of manufacturing such probes,
including manufacturing of the flat elastic substrate made of dielectric material
with the dimensions chosen according to the core size, forming the coil and
securing of the formed coil on the surface of the core. The coil forming may be
made through, for example, photo-lithography or laser processing of the pre-metallized
surface.This method gives some
