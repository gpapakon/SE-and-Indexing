<ABSTRACT>
A polishing tool component comprises a carrier and a plurality of spaced abrasive elements located in a surface of the carrier. Each abrasive element presents a working surface having a perimeter which is circular, polygon or of like non-elongate shape, and comprises a mass of abrasive particles such as diamond or cubic boron nitride uniformly dispersed in a bonding matrix. The bonding matrix may be metal, ceramic or polymeric. The working surfaces of the elements together define a working surface for the component. The working surfaces may be located in the surface in which the elements are located, or project beyond that surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polishing tool component.Polishing pads are used extensively in industry for fine finishing or
polishing various workpieces, which are typically stone or ceramic in
nature. Such polishing pads consist of a carrier having a layer of
abrasive particles suitably secured to a surface thereof. The abrasive
particles may be secured to the surface of the carrier by means of metal
or resin binders.French Patent No. 2532875 discloses a grinding wheel comprising a
plurality of abrasive pads mounted on a support. The abrasive pads
comprise a mass of discrete abrasive particles uniformly dispersed in a
bonding matrix. The pads are in the form of strips.FR-A-1 533 693 discloses a polishing tool component according
to the preamble of claim 1. According to the present invention, there is provided a polishing tool component
including a carrier and a plurality of spaced abrasive elements located in a surface of the
carrier, each abrasive element having a cylindrical or cone-shaped body, one end of
which is located in the carrier and the other end of which presents an abrasive working
surface projecting beyond the carrier surface and having a perimeter which is circular,
polygonal or like non-elongate shape, each said abrasive element including a mass of
ultra-hard abrasive particles comprising diamond or cubic boron nitride, said particles
being of up to 500 microns in size and uniformly dispersed in a bonding matrix, the
abrasive working surfaces of the elements together defining a working surface for the
component, wherein the ultra-hard abrasive particles are present in the working surface
in an amount of up to 30% by volume.Figure 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a polishing pad of the invention;
andFigure 2 is a section along the line 2-2 of Figure 1.The polishing tool component of the invention may be one suitable for various polishing
tools such as revolving tools, revolving pendulum action tools and planetary polishing
tools. The shape of the component may be any known in the art such as rectangular, as
is generally used with revolving and revolving pendulum action tools, or disc-shaped, as
is generally used with planetary polishing tools.The carrier will generally present a surface in which the abrasive elements are located.
The working surfaces of the elements project beyond this surface, and may include at
least one peak. This peak may provide a sharp point, e.g. it may be cone-shaped. Such
peaks, when provided, will generally each have the same height from the carrier
