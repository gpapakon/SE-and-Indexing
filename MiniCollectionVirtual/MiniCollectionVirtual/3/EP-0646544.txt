<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing cage molecules known as fullerenes comprising carbon atoms having closed networks, in particular of pentagonal and/or hexagonal rings, in a reaction vessel facility is characterised by the process steps: introduction of a gas mixture containing between 10% and 100% of carbon monoxide (CO), in particular from 30% to 60%, and generation of a glow discharge within the reaction vessel facility. Using this process, the yield for preparing cage molecules can be optimised and the composition can be varied. An apparatus for preparing the cage molecules is characterised by a reaction vessel facility (1) within which a glow discharge, in particular a direct current glow discharge (DC glow discharge), can be generated, and at least one electrode (4,5) which consists at least in part of a graphite body which can be heated to white heat by means of an additional current.

Method and apparatus for production of cage molecules of 
carbon atoms with closed networks, especially of pentagonal 

and hexagonal rings, called fullerenes, in a reaction 
chamber device,
characterized by
feeding of a gas mixture, which contains between 10% 
and 95% carbon monoxide (CO), especially 30% to 60%, and 
exciting a glow discharge within the reaction chamber 
device. 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
the glow discharge occupies in essence homogenuosly the 
reaction chamber device. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
a gas mixture is feeded in, which contains in addition 
to CO also helium (He) and/or argon (Ar) and/or carbon 

dioxide (CO

). 
Method according to any one or several of the preceding 
claims,
characterized in that
the glow discharge is excited by direct current (dc). 
Method according to any one or several of the preceding 
claims,
characterized in that
