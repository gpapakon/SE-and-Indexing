<ABSTRACT>
A method for dealing with mercury-containing waste including 
button-type batteries, wherein the waste is heated in a 

furnace while being agitated and in the presence of elementary 
selenium vapour in an amount sufficient to form mercury-selenide 

from essentially all the mercury contained by the 
waste. The waste is heated to a temperature at which mercury 

and selenium will be present in a gaseous state and at which 
solid mercury-selenide will not form, and a partial pressure 

of oxygen is maintained at a sufficiently low level to avoid 
oxidation of the selenium. The thus treated mercury-freed 

waste is extracted from the resultant process gas and from any 
other solid material that may be present and is either dumped 

or worked-up metallurgically. After the waste has been 
extracted from the process gas, the process gas is cooled to 

extract therefrom solid, stable mercury-selenide dust suitable 
for dumping, whereafter the gas is passed through a filter 

with the intention of extracting any gaseous mercury that may 
remain in the gas, whereafter the thus cleansed gas is 

released to atmosphere. The invention also relates to plant 
for dealing with mercury-containing waste.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to plant for 
dealing with mercury-containing waste, such as so-called 
button-type batteries in particular, wherein the waste is 
heated in the presence of selenium. The use of mercury-containing button batteries has increased 
progressively over recent decennia and such batteries are now 
used in progressively more applications, for instance in 
clocks, photographic apparatus, mini-calculators and hearing 
aids. The mercury content of this type of battery varies from some 
tenths of a percent up to about 35%. The remainder of the 
battery is comprised mostly of iron, zinc, nickel and chromium. 
About 10 tonnes of such batteries are sold annually in 
Sweden. A rough estimate with regard to Europe as a whole is 
about 500 tonnes. It is estimated that about 85% of these button batteries are 
collected as scrap in Sweden. These batteries are taken, 
together with other small batteries, to a central plant where 
they are stored for destruction or final dumping. Since there 
is still no attractive alternative to destruction, large 
quantities of these batteries remain in store. Dumping of 
batteries that have not been destroyed is an expensive process 
and is, of course, encumbered with rigorous safety requirements. 
Thus, there is a considerable need for a destruction 
method which is suitable for application with such mercury-containing 
waste, particularly when incitement must be found 
to increase the extent to which such batteries are collected, 
so as to prevent these batteries accompanying typical domestic 
waste and being dumped on waste tips around the country. 
Batteries that have not been collected as a matter of routine 
represent a time-fused environmental bomb. In ten or a hundred 
years from the time of being dumped, mercury is liable to leak  
 
from such batteries in an uncontrolled fashion. This latent 
threat is even more frightening when viewed on a worldwide 
basis, where the routine collection of mercury-containing 
batteries is far less organized than in Sweden. A method of the kind defined in the introduction has been 
proposed in International Patent Application WO92/10240. 
According to this method, waste in the form of fluorescent 
tubes and like tubes, and also button-type batteries, are 
melted down to form a glass melt in a closed reactor, with the 
intention that resultant HgSe will bind chemically to the 
glass. The glass is then moulded into briquettes which can be 
dumped in dumps intended therefor. Thus, when practicing this

A method for dealing with mercury-containing waste 
comprising button-type batteries, comprising heating the waste 

in a furnace in the presence of elementary selenium vapour in 
quantities effective to form mercury selenide from essentially 

the total mercury content of the waste, 
characterized
 by 
heating the waste to a temperature at which mercury and 

selenium will exist in gas phase and at which no solid mercury 
selenide will form while vigorously agitating the waste; 

maintaining a partial pressure of oxygen which is sufficiently 
low to avoid selenium oxidation; separating the thus treated 

mercury-freed waste from the resultant process gas together 
with any other solid material that may be present; and dumping 

or working-up the waste metallurgically; and by cooling the 
process gas separated from the waste to extract therefrom 

solid, stable mercury-selenide dust suitable for dumping; and 
passing the gas through a filter to extract any gaseous 

mercury that may remain and releasing the thus cleansed gas 
to atmosphere. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 by heating

A method according to Claim 1 and Claim 2, 
characterized
 
by supplying inert gas to the furnace in order to sustain the 

low partial pressure of oxygen. 
A method according to Claims 1-3,
