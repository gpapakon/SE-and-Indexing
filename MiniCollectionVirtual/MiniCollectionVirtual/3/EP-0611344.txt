<DESCRIPTION>
My invention relates to automotive vehicle 
suspension systems, and particularly to systems for 
the suspension of driving wheels which are maintained 
in parallel rotating planes by a dead axle. For many years the driving wheels of many 
automotive vehicles were maintained in parallel planes 
by a dead axle housing which housed both the live 
axles connected to the driving wheels and the 
differential gears. The vehicle frame and body rested 
on springs supported on the dead axle housing inboard 
of the driving wheels and the wheel brakes. While the foregoing suspension system was used 
for many years on many vehicles, it had a number of 
disadvantages. The necessity of vertical clearance 
between the differential housing and the underside of 
the body created loading problems for both passenger 
vehicles and heavier vehicles such as buses and 
trucks. Moreover, the combined weight of the dead 
axle housing, the differential, the live axles and a 
part of the drive shaft contributed to an undesirably 
high unsprung weight of the vehicle. To overcome the deficiencies of the foregoing 
suspension system, many vehicles used a bowed dead 
axle as suggested in U.S. Patent No. 562,289 to 
DeDion, et al. DeDion, et al.-type suspension systems 
and modifications thereof retained the advantage of a 
rigid connection between the driving wheels, but had 
the additional advantage of lowering the floor of the 
vehicle's body because the minimum ground-to-floor  
 
distance was no longer dependent upon providing 
vertical clearance between the top of the differential 
housing and the body's floor. However, the DeDion, et al. system has not been 
used on buses and heavier trucks because the bowed 
dead axle is subject to severe torsional stresses when 
resisting vertical displacement of the two driving 
wheels. Significant torsional displacement of the 
Debion, et al. bowed dead axle produces unacceptable 
movements of the wheel axes and to eliminate such 
torsional deflection by increasing the size and weight 
of the bowed dead axle for buses and heavy trucks is 
both cost and design prohibitive. The British Patent No. GB-A-1 148 336 discloses a driving 
wheel suspension system corresponding to the preamble of claim 1. My invention provides all the advantages of both 
the dead axle housing system incorporating the live 
axles and the differential gearing and the DeDion, 
et al. bowed dead axle system, while eliminating the 
disadvantages of these two systems. My improved 
suspension system reduces the vehicle's

<CLAIMS>
A driving wheel suspension system for a 
vehicle, the vehicle having a body with a floor, a 

pair of spaced apart driving wheels, a differential (10) 
located beneath the body's floor and supported by the  

 
body midway between the driving wheels, a rotatable 

drive shaft (14) one end of which is connected to the 
differential (10), and a pair of rotatable live axles (20) each 

having one of its ends connected to the differential (10), 
the driving wheel suspension system comprising: 


a pair of wheel support assemblies (15) each 
including a leaf spring (16) lying parallel to the 

vehicle's drive shaft (14) whose opposite ends are 
connected to the vehicle's body, and a wheel spindle (19) 

within a housing (18) mounted on the center of the leaf 
spring, 
the opposite ends of the pair of live axles (20) 
each being connected to the wheel spindle (19) within the 

wheel spindle housing (18) of a wheel support assembly (15), and 
a straight dead axle (12) whose opposite ends are each 
connected to one of the wheel spindle housings 

respectively, characterised in that a 
pair of spaced apart conical bearings (30, 31) are 

journalled in 
the wheel spindle housing (18) at the end of the straight 

dead axle (12), 
 
   whereby the conical bearings (30, 37) supporting the 

dead axle (12) prevent torsional loads being imposed on the 
dead axle caused by vertical displacements of the pair 

of spaced apart driving wheels as the vehicle is 
driven over uneven terrain. 
A driving wheel suspension system according to claim 7 
characterised in that springs (17) are mounted between 

each end of the leaf spring (16) and the vehicle body.
