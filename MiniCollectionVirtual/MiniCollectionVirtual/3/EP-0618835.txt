<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter element 
for the filtration of a stream of gas 
contaminated with liquid in the form of mist. Air flow from oil-lubricated gas compressors or vacuum 
pumps is normally contaminated with oil mist. In 
order to remove this contamination the air is passed 
through a coalescing filter and an example of a known 
type of such filter is disclosed in GB-A-2033247 and is shown 
in Figure 1 of the 
accompanying drawings. The filter is generally 
tubular and comprises a coalescing layer 10 of 
microporous material which fits closely between inner 
and outer foraminous metal cylinders 12,14 and extends 
between upper and lower end caps 16,18. The upper end 
cap 16 is formed with a port 20 to permit the stream 
22 of oil-contaminated air to enter the interior of 
the filter and the lower end cap 18 is closed as 
shown. The coalescing layer 10 is sealed gas-tightly 
to the end caps 16,18 by a curable sealant, e.g. an 
epoxy resin. The coalescing layer 10 is in this 
instance of one or more pleated sheets of 
resin-impregnated borosilicate glass microfibres as  
 
disclosed in Patent No. GB-A-1557821. An alternative 
form of coalescing layer which is formed by moulding 
is disclosed in Patent No. GB-A-1603519. Also 
extending between the end caps 16,18 and covering the 
outer surface of the foraminous cylinder 14 is a 
drainage layer 24 which in this instance is of an 
open-celled foam plastics material, although 
coalescing filters whose drainage layers are of a 
felted fabric material e.g. as disclosed in our 
Patent Specification No. PCT/GB 89/00182 are also 
known. To minimise oil carryover, the drainage layer 
is preferably treated with a fluorocarbon. The air 
entering the filter travels radially outward through 
the coalescing layer 10 and through the drainage layer 
24 from which it is discharged radially as indicated 
at 26. Coalescing filters of this kind can be used in 
a number of attitudes, but this invention is concerned 
with coalescing filters which are intended to depend 
vertically downwards from a filter head and to fit 
with the removable bowl of such a filter head. Droplets of oil carried with the air 22 are coalesced 
by the microporous coalescing layer 10 where the 
individual tiny droplets are combined, and the oil is 
carried outwards to the drainage layer 24 where it  
 
flows downwards to form an oil-saturated band or wet 
zone 28 at the lower end of the drainage layer 24, the 
oil gradually dropping from the wet zone 28 as 
individual large drops
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tubular filter element for filtering out oil mist 
from a gas contaminated therewith, and adapted to extend 

vertically downwards from the head of a filter housing, the element 
comprising a microporous filter layer (10) for coalescing 

the oil mist as the gas flows through the filter, a 
macroporous drainage layer (24) into which the coalesced 

liquid flows and through which the liquid runs to the 
lower end of the filter from which it drains as drops, 

an upper end cap (16a) for connection to the filter head 
and provided with a port (20) to admit the stream of oil 

contaminated gas into the interior of the filter, and a 
lower end cap (18a) which fits gas tightly to the filter 

layer (10) and closes the lower end of the filter, the 
filter layer (10) fitting within an upturned flange (46) 

of the end cap (18a), characterised in that: 

(a) the lower end cap (18a) has a guard (52) that 
surrounds and is spaced radially apart from the filter 

and drainage layers (10,24) and has an axial extent from 
a position above to a position below the lower end of the 

drainage layer (24), the guard (52) further providing a 
finger grip to permit the element to be fitted onto or 

removed from the filter head without the user's fingers 
contacting the drainage layer (24); 
(b) the lower end of the drainage layer (24) passes 
between the upturned flange (46) of the lower end cap and 

the guard (52) and terminates at an axial position below  
 

the filter layer (10); and 
(c) portions (50) of the lower end cap extend 
between the guard (52) and the upturned flange (46) so 

that the guard (52) is supported in position, said 
portions (50) permitting generally unobstructed drainage 

of droplets from the drainage layer (24), whereby in use 
the height of the oil saturated band which forms at the 

lower region of the drainage layer is reduced. 
The filter element of claim 1, wherein the 
coalescing layer is a pleated sheet or is a moulding of 

borosilicate glass micro fibres. 
The element of claim 1 or 2, wherein the drainage 
layer is of an open-celled foam plastics material. 
The element of any preceding claim, wherein the 
drainage layer has been treated with a fluorocarbon to 

minimise oil carry over. 
The element of any preceding claim, wherein the 
guard (52) is continuous. 
The element of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the 
guard is interrupted.
