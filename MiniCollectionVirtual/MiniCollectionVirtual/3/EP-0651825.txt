<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides methods and diagnostic kits for determining the toxicity of a compound. The methods and diagnostic kits of this invention employ a plurality of bacterial hosts, each of which harbors a DNA sequence encoding a different stress promoter fused to a gene which encodes an assayable product. Each of these stress promoters is induced by exposure to a different type of cellular stress. The stress promoters utilized in this invention, in toto, comprise those promoters which respond to redox stress, DNA stress, protein stress, energy stress and pH stress. The methods and diagnostic kits of this invention may be employed to characterize and quantify the toxicity of a compound, as well as to identify the cellular mechanism of its toxic action. Moreover, the methods of this invention yield information concerning the action of a compound on a subcellular level. This information may be utilized to design antitoxins to compounds found to be toxic and in active drug design.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides methods and
diagnostic kits for determining the toxicity of a
compound. The methods and diagnostic kits of this
invention employ a plurality of bacterial hosts, each
of which harbors a DNA sequence encoding a different
stress promoter fused to a gene which encodes an
assayable product. Each of these stress promoters is
induced by exposure to a different type of cellular
stress. The stress promoters utilized in this
invention, in toto, comprise those promoter which
respond to redox stress, DNA stress, protein stress,
energy stress and pH stress. The methods and
diagnostic kits of this invention may be employed to
characterize and quantify the toxicity of a compound,
as well as to identify the cellular mechanism of its
toxic action. Moreover, the methods of this invention
yield information concerning the action of a compound
on a subcellular level. This information may be
utilized to design antitoxins to compounds found to be
toxic and in active drug design. At least 55,000 chemicals are presently
produced in the United States. Over 2,000 new
chemicals are introduced into the market each year.
Very few of these chemicals have been comprehensively
tested for acute or chronic toxicity. For example,
less than 1 percent of commercial chemicals have
undergone complete health hazard assessment.The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
has the authority to require toxicological testing of a
chemical prior to commercial production, but that
authority is rarely invoked. Less than 10 percent of
new chemicals are subjected to detailed review by the
EPA. In the interest of cost and speedy access to the
market, the EPA often uses the toxicity of previously
tested homologous compounds to gauge the toxicity of a
new chemical.The potential toxicity of new drugs is
monitored by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").
For a New Drug Application (NDA), the FDA typically
requires a large battery of toxicity, carcinogenicity,
mutagenicity and reproduction/fertility tests in at
least two species of live animals. These tests are
required to last up to one year. The costs involved in
completing these tests is enormous. For example, a
typical 90-day exposure toxicity test in rats costs
approximately $100,000. A two year toxicity test in
rats costs approximately $800,000 [Casarett and Doull's
Toxicology, 4th Edition, M. O. Amdur et al., eds.
Pergamon Press, New York, New York, p. 37 (1991)].Besides cost, animal testing also presents
disadvantages in terms of time, animal suffering and
accuracy. Typical
