<DESCRIPTION>
Molecular separation systems have been used to separate a mixture of gases 
into its several components. Examples of separation systems include membrane-based 
systems, molecular sieve systems, such as pressure swing adsorption systems, 
and the like. The present invention relates to a process for cooling the feed gas utilized in 
gas separation systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process 
for producing, in a highly-effective and efficient manner, a relatively pure gas from a 
gaseous mixture. Membranes have been employed which use the principle of selective permeation 
to separate mixtures of gases into their components. Each gas has a characteristic 
permeation rate that is a function of its ability to dissolve into and diffuse into a given 
membrane or molecular sieve. Typically, membranes are produced as either flat 
sheets or as hollow fibers. Flat sheets are usually employed in spiral wound 
separators while hollow fibers are employed in shell and tube type separators. Other 
innovative configurations employing flat sheet or hollow fiber membranes are also 
available. In a bundle of hollow fiber membranes positioned by various means and 
orientations within an elongated shell, one or more gases are separated from a mixture 
of gases by allowing the gases to permeate selectively through the membrane. For 
example, relatively pure nitrogen can be made from air by feeding compressed air into 
one end of an elongated container filled with a plurality of juxtaposed axially hollow  
 
fiber membranes running longitudinally of the container. The feed can enter the bores 
of the fibers or the outside of the fibers. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and other 
gases will permeate through the membrane fibers, but nitrogen permeates at a much 
slower rate. The gases passing through the membrane and separated from the 
mixture of gases are withdrawn from the low pressure side of the membrane. The 
portion of the air which does not permeate the membrane fibers after contact with the 
active membrane surface is relatively pure nitrogen. Generally, the nitrogen gas will 
have a small amount of oxygen. Most mixtures of gases, such as air, contain some 
water vapor. The amount of water vapor in the gas is typically characterized by the 
dew point temperature of the gas mixture. The dew point is the temperature at which 
water will begin condensing from the gas mixture at its pressure. Water vapor 
successfully passes through the membrane fibers but condensed water has a tendency 
to clog the
