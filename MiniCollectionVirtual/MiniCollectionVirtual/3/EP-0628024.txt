<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHESIS OF lOVERSOL USING A MINIMAL EXCESS OF ACETOXYACETYLCHLORIDEField of the Invention The present invention relates to the use of a minimal excess of acetoxyacetylchloride as a reagent in the synthesis of ioversol.Background of the Invention Ioversol is disclosed as a useful nonionic x-ray contrast agent in U.S. Patent No. 4,396,598. 5-acetoxy- acetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo- isophthalamide having the following structure:CONHCH2CHO CH2OACΛ- CONHCH2CHOACCH2O, CH 0 H2C0NHFORMULA Iis an intermediate compound in the production of ioversol. The compound of Formula I and its use in the production of ioversol is likewise disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,396,598 incorporated herein by reference. 5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N'- bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,396,598, may be produced by adding acetoxyacetylchloride (AAC) to a N,N- dimethylacetamide and 1,1,2-trichloroethane solution of a compound of the following structure: 
FORMULA IIand stirring until the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is then diluted with 1,1,2-trichloroethane and extracted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solutions and aqueous sodium chloride solutions.The dilution procedure using 1,1,2- trichloroethane may alternatively be carried out using an organic solvent such as, but not limited to, carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2- dichloroethane, 1, 1, 2-trichloroethylene, 1, 1,2- trichloroethane, 1 , 1 , 1-trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene, but most preferably 1,1,2- trichloroethane.The procedure for producing 5-acetoxyacetamido- N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide has become well known in the art and heretofore required the use of a 100% excess of acetoxyacetylchloride (AAC) to perform the intermediate synthetic step just described.An improved procedure that minimizes the need for acetoxyacetylchloride (AAC) in the intermediate synthetic step which produces 5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N,-bis(2,3- diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide is desired as 

an alternate and more cost efficient method of producing ioversol. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to meet these needs.Summary of the Invention The present invention is a method of producing ioversol using only approximately 7 to 36%, but preferably a 12% excess, of acetoxyacetylchloride (AAC) as opposed to a 100% excess as taught by prior art. The procedure begins with a solvent solution of 5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-
