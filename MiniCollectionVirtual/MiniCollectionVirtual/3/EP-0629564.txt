<ABSTRACT>
This container (vessel) includes a neck (26), the free end of which is equipped with an orifice through which the pressurised liquid contained in the container can flow out, this neck being closed by a cap (30) which can be perforated in order to free the pressurised liquid. The arrangement for supplying pressurised liquid comprises the container and means (36) for connecting the neck (26) to a pipe (37) for supplying a hydraulic circuit with pressurised liquid, these means being equipped with means (40) for piercing the cap which can be actuated after the neck has been connected to the supply pipe (37). This arrangement makes it possible to supply, for example, a brake fluid reservoir of a hydraulic braking circuit with pressurised brake fluid in order to bleed this circuit.

Container containing a fluid, of the type 
comprising a spout (26) the free end of which is 

provided with an outflow opening (28) for the fluid 
contained in the container, closed off by a seal (30) 

which can be perforated to release the fluid, 
characterised in that the fluid is a pressurised brake 

fluid for motor vehicles. 
Container according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the seal (30) is made of a complex 

aluminium/polyethylene material and is heat-sealed over 
the free end of the spout (26). 
Container according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the fluid is at a pressure of several 

atmospheres. 
Container according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the pressure of the fluid is 

created by a piston (22) inside the container, which is 
movable between a chamber (18) containing pressurised 

gas and a chamber (20) containing the fluid. 
Container according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the spout (26) is externally 

threaded so that this spout can be screwed onto either a 
stopper (32) protecting the seal (30) or a member (38) 

for connecting the stopper (26) to a hydraulic circuit. 
Unit for supplying a hydraulic circuit with 
pressurised fluid, comprising a container according to 

any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it 
further comprises means (36) for connecting the spout 

(26) of the container to a pipe (37) for supplying the 
hydraulic circuit with pressurised fluid, comprising 

means (40) for piercing the seal (30) which can be  
 

actuated after the spout (26) has been connected to the 
supply pipe. 
Supply unit according to claims 5 and 6 taken 
together, characterised in that the connecting means 

(36) comprise a connector (38) intended to be screwed 
tightly onto the spout (26), and a push-in piercing 

member (40) slidably mounted in a leaktight manner in 
the connector (38) between a resting position and a 

position for piercing the seal, provided with a channel 
(46) one end (50) of which is connected to the supply 

pipe (37) whilst the other end opens out level with the 
spout (26) of the container, this latter end comprising 

a projection (48) for piercing the seal (30). 
Method of bleeding a hydraulic brake circuit 
comprising a brake fluid reservoir and bleeding ports, 

characterised in that the reservoir is supplied with 
pressurised brake fluid using a unit according to claim 

6 or 7, in which the container contains the pressurised 
brake fluid, so as to pressurise the hydraulic brake 

circuit, and the outflow of brake fluid through the open 
bleeding ports is monitored.
