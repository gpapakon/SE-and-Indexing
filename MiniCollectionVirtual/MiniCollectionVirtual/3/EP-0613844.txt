of ceramic tiles (3) in multiple sizes comprises a tile pickup 

line (4) that has a multiplicity of sucker units (5) that can be 
activated/deactivated at corresponding stations (8,9) provided 

with actuation means; the pickup line (4) conveys the tiles (3) to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
sorting, forming and removing stacks of ceramic tiles in 
multiple shapes. The automatic handling of ceramic tiles currently uses 
machines that in order to form the stacks meant for various 
processing steps pick up said tiles by means of a series of 
pneumatically-operated suckers which are connected to the 
arms of a mechanical carousel which is actuated so that it 
rotates and around which the various stacking stations are 
located. These known machines have the general prerogative of 
moving the tiles gently, without causing impacts and damage 
to them, and of automatically dividing said tiles into 
separate stacks on the basis of the so-called "choice" to 
which each tile belongs. These known machines work very well but are susceptible 
of further improvements that make them operate not only 
rotationally but also in a linear manner, so that they are 
more versatile in use. Known machines furthermore have 
considerable dimensions, and their arms that form the 
carousel are very long, producing very high peripheral 
rotation speeds in addition to occupying a considerable 
amount of space. Furthermore, very tall stacks are currently formed when 
handling small tiles, and therefore the rise of the center 
of gravity of said stacks causes them to be highly unstable. DE-A-2 021 485 discloses a stack moving apparatus 
including a pickup line having sucker units and being 
feedable with a feeder conveyor. A first station is 
positioned for unloading of the feeder conveyor to the  
 
pickup line and a second station is positioned for unloading 
from the pickup line to a removal conveyor via a stacking table. The technical aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the shortcomings of the prior art by providing an 
apparatus for sorting, forming and removing stacks of 
ceramic tiles in multiple sizes that allows to also work 
along straight lines and absolutely independently of 
structural restrictions, at the same time ensuring great 
stability to the formed stacks. This aim and other objects are achieved by an apparatus 
for sorting, forming and removing stacks of ceramic tiles in 
multiple sizes, as defined in the appended claims. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the description of a preferred but 
not exclusive embodiment of an apparatus for forming and 
sorting stacks of flat products, illustrated only by way of 
non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, 
wherein:

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for sorting, forming and removing stacks 
(2) of ceramic tiles (3) in multiple sizes, comprising a 

tile pickup line (4) that has a multiplicity of mutually 
independent sucker units (5) that can be 

activated/deactivated at corresponding stations (8,9) 
provided with actuation means (6), wherein said line (4) is 

feedable in step by step advancement by means of a 
conventional tile feeder conveyor (7), at the unloading end 

of which there is at least one first station (8) for the 
activation of the sucker units (5), at least one second 

station (9) for their deactivation being provided vertically 
above the active portion of an additional conveyor (10) for 

removing the formed stacks which is arranged below and 
aligned with said pickup line (4), and which has stack 

supporting elements (10a) which are distributed with a 
preset pitch (P
1
) on the removal conveyor (10) for supporting 
tiles in one or more stacks, means (11) for accumulating and 

depositing the stacked tiles being interposed between said 
pickup line (4) and said removal conveyor (10) such that 

tiles are accumulated on said means (11) which subsequently 
move to deposit the accumulated tiles on said stack 

supporting elements (10a) arranged on the removal conveyor 
(10). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that each one of said sucker units (5) is constituted by a 

cup-shaped element (12) made of flexible material for 
contact with the tiles which is connected to an axially deformable 

box-like body inside which there is a bellows-like chamber 
(15), the axial compression or elongation of said chamber  

 
and consequently of said box-like body producing negative 

pressure inside the cup-shaped element. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said bellows-like chamber (15) is formed between the 

top of said box-like body (13) and a base block (14) which 
is preset for coupling to the pickup line (4) and is crossed 

by respective ducts (15a,15b) for connecting said chamber 
and the internal cavity of the cup-shaped element. 
Apparatus according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said elements for 

supporting the stacks of tiles are constituted by successive 
series (S) of pads (10a) which are arranged in rows and 

columns and are rigidly coupled in a known manner on the 
active supporting face of the removal conveyor (10), gaps 

(10b) of preset width being formed between said rows and 
said columns. 
Apparatus according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said distribution 

pitch (P
1
) of the successive series (S) of pads (10a) is 
equal to at least twice the total horizontal space 

occupation (P
2
) of the accumulation and deposition means 
(11). 
Apparatus according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said means (11) for 

accumulating and depositing the stacked tiles are 
constituted by a quadrangular frame (16) that forms a 

horizontal comb which provides a horizontal supporting 
surface for the stacks (2) of tiles (3), the teeth (16a) of 

said comb being parallel to the advancement direction (A) of 
the removal conveyor, the joining cross-member (16b) of said  

 
comb being arranged at right angles to said direction and 

upstream with respect to the teeth, said teeth being 
suitable to snugly enter, with vertical movements that can 

be produced by means of appropriate elements (17), the gaps

active portion of the removal conveyor. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in 
that said elements (17) for the vertical movement of the 

horizontal comb-like frame include a substantially 
horizontal cantilevered arm (18) that forms, without 

discontinuities, said cross-member (16b) that connects the 
teeth (16a), one of its ends being associated with a slider 

(19) that is guided so that it can slide and is motorized in 
a conventional manner in a vertical guide (20). 
Apparatus according to any one or more of claims 6 
and 7, characterized in that the vertical extension (H

gaps (10b) formed between them.
