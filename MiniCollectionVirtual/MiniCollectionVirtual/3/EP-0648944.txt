<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic connecting element with a retaining region 2 which holds a part and with a fastening region 3 which is to be connected to a support, in particular a motor-vehicle body, provision being made for the tolerance between the part and the support to be compensated for. According to the invention, the retaining region 2 and the fastening region 3 are connected by at least two spiral-shaped elastic arms 6, 7, 8 for compensating for the tolerance in the directions lying in the plane of the support.

<CLAIMS>
Plastic connecting element having a retaining 
region (2), which secures a part, and a fastening region 

(3), which can be connected to a carrier (4), in particular 
a motor-vehicle body, tolerance compensation being 

provided between the part (5) and the carrier (4), and 
the retaining region (2) and the fastening region (3) 

being connected by at least two elastic arms (6', 7', 8') 
for the purpose of tolerance compensation in the directions 

located in the carrier plane (E-E), characterized 
in that the retaining region (2) of the single-piece 

connecting element (1') is connected to the fastening 
region (3), which supports a clip-in part (30) or a 

profile bolt, via a plurality of angled, elastic arms 
(6', 7', 8') which run parallel to the carrier plane (E-E), 

in that the fastening region (3) and the retaining 
region (2) are each designed in the form of a lateral 

surface of a cylinder, three arms (6', 7', 8'), which are 
distributed uniformly over the circumference, connecting 

the retaining region (2) and the fastening region (3), 
and in that, with respect to the lateral surface of the 

cylinder (13), each angled arm (6', 7', 8') has a radial 
region (21) and a connection region which runs at an 

acute angle with respect to said radial region and 
adjoins the inner circumference of the fastening region 

(3). 
Connecting element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the radial region (21) of the arms (6', 

7', 8') is shorter in each case than the connection 
region (22).  

 
Connecting element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the fastening 

region (3) has a base plate (23) which is axis-parallel 
to the carrier plane (E-E) and on the underside of which 

the clip-in part (30) or a profile bolt is arranged. 
Connecting element according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that a recess (34), which runs parallel to the 

carrier plane (E-E), is located in the fastening region 
(3), between the base plate (23) and the retaining region 

(2) with the arms (6', 7', 8'). 
Connecting element according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the recess (34) penetrates the outer 

circumference of the fastening region (3) via a slit 
(35). 
Connecting element according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the penetration covers a region of 

between 90° and 120° of the outer circumference of the 
fastening region (3). 
Connecting element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the retaining 

region (2) has a cylindrical opening (16) with a shoulder 
(17) running all the way around in the top region. 
Connecting element according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the opening (16) is closed off by a base 

(18). 
Connecting element according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the opening (16) and/or the base (18) 

are/is provided with at least one fixing element which 
interacts with a retaining element (40). 
Connecting element according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that, as fixing element, the base (18) has a 

fixing rib (19), which extends radially through the 
opening (16), for the retaining element (40). 
Connecting element according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a circular, 

elastic sealing lip (42) is arranged beneath the base 
plate (23).
