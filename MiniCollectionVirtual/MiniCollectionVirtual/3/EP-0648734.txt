<ABSTRACT>
A homogeneous liquid phase process for producing a vinyl 
carboxylate in which the carboxylate group contains at least four carbon 

atoms, which process comprises (1) forming a homogeneous liquid 
reaction mixture containing ethylene, oxygen carboxylic acid having at 

least three carbon atoms, a palladium (II) catalyst and a copper (II) oxidant 
and (2) maintaining the reaction mixture under conditions at which the 

ethylene and the carboxylic acid react to form the vinyl carboxylate in the 
homogeneous liquid reaction mixture, with the proviso that at least one of 

the following conditions exists during said process: 

(i) the copper (II) oxidant is a copper (II) carboxylate in 
which carboxylate group has a molecular weight that is higher than the 

molecular weight of the carboxylate group in the carboxylic acid; 
(ii) the palladium (II) catalyst is formed in situ in the 
reaction mixture by the oxidation of a palladium (0) colloid; and/or 
(iii) the reaction mixture also contains a polyglyme 
compound as a promoter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of higher vinyl 
esters (e.g., vinyl 2-ethylhexanoate) and, in particular, to a homogeneous 
liquid phase process for producing such esters from ethylene and higher 
carboxylic acids (e.g., 2-ethylhexanoic acid). Vinyl esters (e.g., vinyl acetate) are valuable starting 
materials for use in producing polymers. Higher vinyl esters (i.e., vinyl 
esters of carboxylic acids containing at least four carbon atoms) are more 
desirable than vinyl acetate in applications where it desired that polymers 
produced from the esters have glass transition temperatures different 
from the glass transition temperatures that can be obtained using vinyl 
acetate. Vinyl acetate is conventionally produced by reacting 
ethylene and acetic acid in a gas phase reaction mixture. However, similar 
gas phase processes involving ethylene and higher carboxylic acids are not 
completely satisfactory because the higher boiling points of the higher 
carboxylic acids makes them more difficult to volatilize and because the 
resulting higher vinyl esters makes them more difficult to separate from 
the other components of the reaction mixture. Hence vinyl esters of 
higher carboxylic acids are usually produced in the liquid phase by 
transvinylation of the higher carboxylic acid with vinyl acetate or by 
reacting the higher carboxylic acid with acetylene. A drawback of the 
former (transvinylation) process is that two reactions (vinylation and 
transvinylation) are required to convert ethylene to the desired ester while 
a drawback of the latter (acid/acetylene) process is that acetylene is more 
expensive than ethylene.  Efforts have been made to overcome the above problems by 
providing homogeneous liquid phase processes for producing vinyl 
carboxylates in which the carboxylate groups contains at least four carbon 
atoms by: (1) forming a homogeneous liquid mixture containing ethylene, 
oxygen, a carboxylic acid having at least four carbon atoms, a palladium 
(II) catalyst and a copper (II) oxidant and (2) maintaining the mixture 
under conditions at which the ethylene and the carboxylic acid react to 
form the vinyl carboxylate in the homogeneous liquid mixture. However, 
such processes have not been entirely satisfactory in that catalyst activity 
and stability leave room for improvement and cocatalysts may be 
required. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved process for producing higher vinyl esters directly from ethylene 
and higher carboxylic acids. Other objects of
