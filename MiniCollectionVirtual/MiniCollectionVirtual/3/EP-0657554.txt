<ABSTRACT>
Process making it possible to produce by isothermal forging circular articles reinforced with fibres over chosen portions of their section, the other portions remaining available for performing the other functions of the article. The invention is noteworthy in that it consists chiefly in producing grooves (8) in a blank (3) of the article (1), in producing preforms (12) from reinforcing fibre and from added metal to the dimensions of the grooves (8), in closing these grooves (8) using plugs (14) and in forming the article (1) by isothermal forging. Application to high-performance rotors such as the rotors of turbine engines employed in aeronautics.

operations:

producing a blank (3) of the piece (1),
forming at least one groove (8) in the blank (3); the
said groove (8) being annular and open at least in the

axial direction;
producing preforms (12) of fibre and of filler metal;
introducing the preforms (12) of fibre and of filler
metal into the groove (8);
blocking off the groove (8) with a plug (14) coming
into contact with the preforms (12) and protruding from

the groove (8), the said plug (14) being produced from
a metal exhibiting an isothermal forging temperature

close to or above that of the filler metal of the preforms
(12);
forging of the blank (3) along the axial direction,
so as simultaneously to bring about compression of the

preforms (12), welding of the compressed preforms (12)
with the rest of the piece (1) as well as forging of

the piece (1);

characterised in that the forging of the blank (3) is
an isothermal forging along the axial direction combined

with a centrifugal radial isothermal forging so
as to obtain practically isostatic compression.
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece in accordance with Claim 1, characterised

in that the spaces (13) remaining between the preforms
(12) and the walls (10) and (11) of the groove (8) are

filled up with powder which can be welded to the metal
of the piece.
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised

in that the powder and the filler metal of the 
preforms (12) have isothermal Forging temperatures

which are close to or below that of the metal of the
blank (3).
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to

3, characterised in that a plastic flow of metal of the
ring (1) along a radial direction is implemented over

at least one flank (18) of this piece (1) during the
isothermal forging operation.
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to

4, characterised in that the blank (3) is surrounded by
a belt (47) exhibiting a low coefficient of thermal expansion.
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece, in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to

5, characterised in that fibre preforms (12A) are produced
which are separate from the filler metal preforms

(12b), the said fibre preforms (12A) and the said metal
preforms (12B) each having the shape of a flat washer

hollowed out at its centre, and in that the fibre preforms
(12A) and the metal preforms (12B) are stacked

alternately in the groove (8), in such a way that each
metal preform (12B) separates two fibre preforms (12A).
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece in accordance with Claim 6, characterised

in that the metal preforms 12B are perforated without
loss of material.
Method of obtaining a fibre-reinforced circular
metal piece in accordance with Claim 6 or 7, characterised

in that the obtaining of the fibre preforms (12A)
especially includes the following operations:
