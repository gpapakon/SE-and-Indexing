<ABSTRACT>
In an image forming apparatus using a transfer unit of 
a roller transfer method, the contact between the transfer 

unit (4) and a photoreceptor drum (1) can easily be canceled. 
The transfer unit is brought into contact with the 

photoreceptor drum by supplying an upward pushing force to a 
supporting member (10, 10a, 12) of the transfer unit, and a 

lever (30 - 34) engaging with the supporting member to push 
down the supporting member is provided to connect with a 

front cover (32) of the apparatus body. The transfer roller 
(8), the pre-transfer roller (20) for feeding a sheet to the 

photoreceptor drum and driving force transmitting gears (24 
- 27) provided therebetween are supported by the same member 

to fix their relative positions so that the driving force is 
constantly transmitted from the transfer roller to the pre-transfer 

roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus 
employing a roller transfer method such as an electrophotographic 
copying machine, a laser printer and a facsimile 
apparatus, and more particularly, to an image forming apparatus 
where the contact between a transfer unit and a photoreceptor 
drum can easily be canceled. In an image forming apparatus employing an electrophotographic 
method, a latent image formed on the surface of a 
photoreceptor drum is developed by charged toner to form a toner 
image, and the toner image is transferred onto a sheet of paper 
to obtain a toner image on the sheet. As a method of transferring 
a toner image from the photoreceptor drum onto the sheet, 
a roller transfer method is known. According to the roller 
transfer method, a transfer roller is arranged opposite to the 
photoreceptor drum, and to transfer the toner image, a voltage 
of a polarity reverse to that of the toner image carried by the 
photoreceptor drum on its surface is applied to the transfer 
roller when the sheet passes between the photoreceptor drum and 
the transfer roller. The roller transfer method is divided into 
a contact type and a non-contact type according to whether or 
not the transfer roller is in contact with the surface of the 
photoreceptor drum. As a method of holding the transfer roller so as to be out  
 
of contact with the photoreceptor drum in a transfer unit 
employing the non-contact type roller transfer method, for 
example, a gap maintaining roller as shown in Fig. 1 is used. 
To each end of a roller shaft 52 to which a transfer roller 51 
is attached, a gap maintaining roller 53 having a diameter 
greater than that of the transfer roller 51 is attached, and the 
periphery of the gap maintaining roller 53 is rotatively in 
contact with the surface of the photoreceptor drum 54 so that a 
predetermined gap C is left between the transfer roller 51 and 
the photoreceptor drum 54. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a schematic front view 
of a transfer unit using the gap maintaining roller 53. Below 
the photoreceptor drum 54, the transfer roller 51 is arranged so 
as to be out of contact with the drum surface by the above-described 
method. In the upstream side of the transfer roller 
51, a pre-transfer guide 55 having a guide plate 55a for guiding 
a sheet P to the surface of the photoreceptor drum 54 is 
arranged. Above the guide plate 55a, a pre-transfer roller 56 
for sending the sheet P to the photoreceptor drum 54 at a speed 
equal to the movement speed of the
