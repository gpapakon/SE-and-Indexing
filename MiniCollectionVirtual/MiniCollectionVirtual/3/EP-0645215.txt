<ABSTRACT>
There is proposed a fixing plate, on one plate surface (3) of which valves or other objects can be fastened. Provided in this one plate surface (3) are two sets (28, 29) of anchoring grooves (2', 2'') which are distributed over the plate surface (3) so that the different groove sets (28, 29) interlock. Within a respective groove set (28, 29), the groove cross-sections are identical. However, the groove cross-sections of one groove set (28) are greater than those of the other groove set (29). In this way, a simple and secure fastening of different-sized structural elements to one and the same plate surface (3) is possible.

Connection plate (1, 1') for components such as valves or 
other objects to be used in the field of pneumatics, with an 

assembly (28) of anchorage slots (2, 2') with slot cross-sections 
identical to one another formed in one plate surface and which 

are suitable for the anchoring of fastening elements, in 
particular of so-called slot blocks, wherein the anchorage slots 

are distributed over the plate surface (3) parallel and side-by 
side at intervals, each extending over the complete length of the 

plate surface, characterized in that at least one further 
assembly (29) of anchorage slots (2, 2'') with slot cross-sections 

identical to one another are formed in this one plate 
surface (3), with each anchorage slot (2, 2'') of this further 

slot assembly (29) having a smaller slot cross-section than each 
anchorage slot (2, 2') of the first slot assembly (28), and that 

the anchorage slots (2, 2'') of the further slot assembly (29), 
with respect to the parallel side-by-side arrangement of the 

anchorage slots (2, 2') of the first slot assembly (28), are 
similarly distributed over the aforesaid plate surface, so that 

the different slot assemblies (28, 29) engage in one another. 
Connection plate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
a single further set (29) of anchorage slots (2, 2'') is provided 

in the one plate surface (3), resulting in two slot assemblies 
(28, 29) engaging in one another. 
Connection plate according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the anchorage slots (2, 2', 2'') of the different slot 

assemblies (28, 29) are alternately so arranged side-by-side that 
an anchorage slot (2, 2'') of a specific further slot assembly 

(29) follows each anchorage slot (2, 2') of the first slot 
assembly (28).  

 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the anchorage slots (2, 2') of the first 

slot assembly (28) have a nominal slot neck width of 8 mm, and 
the anchorage slots (2, 2'') of a further slot assembly (29) have 

a nominal slot neck width of 5 mm. 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that each anchorage slot (2) has an anchorage 

section (16) next to and below the slot neck (15), which is wider 
than the slot neck (15) and has a trapezoidal cross-section with 

the wider base line facing the slot neck (15). 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the slot depth of the anchorage slots (2, 

2'') of the further slot assembly (29) is less than that of the 
anchorage slots (2, 2') of the first slot assembly (28), with the 

slot depth of the further slot assembly (29) being preferably 
half that of the first slot assembly (28). 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that, formed in the second plate surface (4) 

opposite the first plate surface (3) are further anchorage 
recesses (2, 2'''), distributed parallel over the second plate 

surface (4) with reference to one another and to the anchorage 
slots (2, 2', 2'') of the first plate surface (3), and adjacent 

to one another at intervals. 
Connection plate according to claim 7, characterized in that 
all anchorage slots (2, 2''') of the second plate surface (4) 

have the same slot cross-section as one another, which is 
expediently the same as that of the anchorage slots (2, 2'') of 

the further slot assembly (29) of the first plate surface (3).  
 
Connection plate according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that, in each intermediate area (35) between two anchorage slots 

(2, 2', 2'') of that part of the second plate surface (4) lying 
opposite the first plate surface (3), there is an anchorage slot 

(2, 2''') of the second plate surface (4). 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that it has several duct-like channels (36) in 

the interior of the plate and running parallel to the anchorage 
slots (2), extending over the entire length of the plate. 
Connection plate according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the duct-like channels (36) form at least in part supply ducts 

for the guidance of a medium such as fluid or power, which may 
expediently be taken off or tapped via branch ducts (43) running 

at right-angles to the longitudinal axis (12) of the plate. 
Connection plate according to claim 10 or 11, characterized 
in that at least one and preferably several duct-like channels 

(36, 36') adjacent to one another over the width (13) of the 
plate are provided, each flanked on the longitudinal side by one 

anchorage slot (2, 2'') of the second slot assembly (29), by two 
anchorage slots (2, 2') of the first slot assembly (28) flanking 

this anchorage slot (2, 2'') on either side, and by two anchorage 
slots (2, 2''') of the second plate surface (4), and thereby 

surrounded by an anchorage slot assembly, wherein they each lie 
beneath the aforementioned anchorage slot (2, 2'') of the second 

slot assembly (29). 
Connection plate according to any of claims 10 to 12, 
characterized in that several duct-like channels (36, 45) are 

provided, each running between two adjacent anchorage slots (2, 
2''') of the second plate surface (4) in the same plane as the 

latter.  
 
Connection plate according to claim 13, characterized in 
that the duct-like channels (36) located between two adjacent 

anchorage slots (2, 2''') of the second plate surface (4) each 
lie opposite one of the anchorage recesses (2, 2') of the first 

slot assembly (28) across the width of the connection plate. 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that one or more of the duct-like channels (36) 

has a cross-section, preferably circular, which facilitates the 
screwing-in of a threaded section belonging in particular to a 

fastening screw (46). 
Connection plate according to any of claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that a coupling device (23) for the side 

attachment of a further connection plate (1'') is provided at 
each of the two longitudinal-side narrow faces (11) of the
