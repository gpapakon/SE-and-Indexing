<ABSTRACT>
To determine the stabilized surface insulation 
resistance (SIR) of a printed circuit board substrate a 

test printed circuit board is provided which has 
desirable clean surface conditions. This surface which 

bears a predetermined circuit board test pattern (10) 
has a known SIR characteristic resulting in a known 

stabilized SIR. The test board is then subjected to a 
soldering step which, in practice, is performed in the 

in-line production with commercial boards. After the 
soldering step, the SIR characteristic of the soldered 

test board is determined for a time period sufficient 
for comparison with the SIR characteristic of the clean 

test board to enable the stabilized SIR of the soldered 
test board to be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circuit board
manufacture.During the manufacture of printed circuit boards,
circuit components are connected to board circuitry on a
surface of the substrate in a soldering process by the step
of soldering leads of the components to terminals on the
board circuitry. As a part of the soldering process, flux
is applied to the surface of the substrate. The soldering
process is normally performed by a known technique commonly
referred to as "wave soldering" and, after soldering, the
completed circuit board is cleaned with a material to
remove any excess flux which is likely to cover surface
portions of the substrate. Such a cleaning material is
chlorinated fluorocarbon, such as freon, and is commonly
referred to as CFC.In more recent times, concerns have been raised
regarding the advisability of using CFC, because it is
known to be environmentally harmful. As a result, CFC is
being avoided by using low solid fluxes, normally referred
to as "no clean fluxes", for wave soldering operations.
With the use of a no clean flux, a flux deposition on the
substrate surface needs to be carefully controlled such
that only a required amount necessary for the soldering
process is deposited on the substrate. However, there are
attendant problems in controlling deposition of a no clean
flux. For instance, hot spots may occur in the equipment
thus resulting in erratic as distinct from a uniform flux
deposition. Also, a preheating operation before entry of a
printed circuit board into the solder wave may provide
insufficient heat to completely decompose chemical
activators in the flux. In addition, active flux may still
be present upon a printed circuit board after a wave
soldering operation, because of an over application of flux
or the activation chemicals may be out of control. As a
result, active flux deposits may remain on the substrate
surface after manufacture of the PCB and such deposits may 
have an effect on the performance of the board, e.g. with
regard particularly to the insulation properties of the
board surface between different conductor paths. Hence,
process control procedures are required to test finished
boards.One such procedure involves the determination of
surface insulation resistance (referred to herein as "SIR")
of printed circuit boards and for this procedure, and after
passing through the soldering step finished printed circuit
boards are removed at intervals from commercial production
for test purposes. The test procedure involves applying
for specific periods, a
