<ABSTRACT>
The use of the aqueous hair-treatment agents proposed, which contain a combination of cationic imidazolinium-group-containing polymers and amphoteric or zwitterionic polymers, gives the hair extremely good wet-combing characteristics and displaces the dry-combability to an extent which is optimum for hair-style hold.

A water-based hair treatment preparation containing a combination of
cationic and amphoteric or zwitterionic polymers in addition to typical

cosmetic constituents, characterized in that the cationic polymers contain
imidazolinium groups and at least one nonionic monomer, the ratio between

cationic and nonionic monomers being in the range from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5, and
the zwitterionic polymers consist essentially of


(α) monomers containing quaternary ammonium groups corresponding to
general formula (I):

monomer (α) is acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride while the

monomer (β) is acrylic acid or an alkali metal salt, more particularly the 
sodium salt, of acrylic acid.
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the number of monomers (α) in the zwitterionic polymer is greater than the

number of monomers (β).
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
it contains


0.01 to 10% by weight and more particularly 0.01 to 5% by weight of
zwitterionic polymers and
0.01 to 10% by weight and more particularly 0.01 to 5% by weight of
cationic polymers, based on the preparation as a whole.
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
it also contains a surfactant.
A preparation as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the
surfactant is a cationic or nonionic surfactant.
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
the preparation has a pH value of 2.5 to 7 and, more particularly, in the range

from 3.0 to 6.0.
A process for treating hair, characterized in that a preparation as
claimed in any of claims 1 to 8 is applied to the hair.
A process as claimed in claim 9, characterized in that the hair is
subsequently rinsed with water or with a preparation largely containing water.
