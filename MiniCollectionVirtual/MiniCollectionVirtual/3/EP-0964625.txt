<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shoe (2) which preferably is intended for running, but also suitable for other moving athletic sports as well as walking and outdoor life. According to the invention, the shoe as seen from below includes a straight, bowed, to circular sole design. When seen in a side view, the shoe exhibits a sole profile with a break edge (9) at the front part of the sole part of the forefoot. The sole members, forefoot (7) and heel (8) may be varied in distance, height, diameter, alternatively length and width. The frame, sole and sole parts of the shoe are substantially stiff to completely stiff.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sole
structure preferably for running, comprising a frame and an
underlying sole connected to the frame, the frame including a
toe part and a bottom portion, the toe part being bent upwards
in relation to and forming an angle with the remaining part of
the frame, said toe part further being at least substantially
rigid, along the longitudinal axis, in a downward direction towards the
underlying sole, the sole comprising two
sole members, one of which being a front sole member and the
other being a rear sole member, which sole members are provided
at a distance from each other, the front part of the
front sole member comprising a break edge for providing a fall
function for the sole structure in use after its contact with and
roll off along a surface.Shoes used today for competition or exercise
running usually include a substantially flat and flexible sole,
and also exhibit a large weight. According to an
investigation, the average weight was about 350 gram per shoe.This results in that the risk for damages will
be large due to for example incorrect positioning of the shoes
when contacting the ground and that you can not to a
maximum exploit the dynamic forces that are generated during
the time in which the shoes are used for running.US-A-1 021 142 shows a pneumatic walking
attachment comprising a plate with a sole section and a heel
section, to each of which sections a rubber cup is secured.
However, the sole parts are fixedly connected to the plate and
moreover the structure is not appropriate for e.g. running due
to its stiffness, flatness and shape.The main object of the present invention is
therefore primarily to solve said problems with efficient and
secure functioning sole structures or shoes by its 
construction so that its material, shape and function cooperate
for an optimum use of bio-mechanical laws, angles,
shapes and forces.The aforementioned object is achieved by means
of a sole structure in accordance with the present invention
which is primarily characterized in that the sole members are
detachably connected to the bottom portion of the frame and in
that the sole members each have a varying thickness in the
longitudinal direction of the frame, the thickness of the front
part of the front sole member and the rear part of the rear
sole member being smaller than the thickness of the remaining
parts of the sole members, such that the sole cross-section
longitudinally along the frame substantially assumes the form
of an arch, and by means of a shoe with such
