<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveying system provided 
with a rail system, with a trolley (4) or the like, which is movable 

along 
said rail system, and with a switch device (16), by means of which a 

trolley (4) 
can be diverted from one rail track (1) to another rail track (13) 

connected to 
said first rail track. The trolley (4) or the like is provided with 

two guide 
means, which are arranged some distance apart and which cooperate during 

operation with a fixed guide means (6) extending in the longitudinal 
direction 

of a rail track. The trolley (4) is furthermore provided with two 
further guide 

means, which are arranged some distance apart and which are furthermore 
arranged in staggered relationship with respect to each other, transversely 

to the intended direction of movement, for cooperation with guide means, 
which form part of said switch device (16), for diverting said 

trolley (4) from 
one rail track (1) to the other (13), which guide means are disposed 

near the 
connection between said two rail tracks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveying system provided with a
rail system with a trolley or the like, which is movable along said
rail system and with a switch device by means of which a trolley can
be diverted from said rail track to another rail track connected to
said first rail track, wherein said trolley or the like is provided
with two guide members which are arranged some distance apart in the
intended direction of movement of a trolley along a rail track and
which cooperate during operation with a fixed guide rail extending in
the longitudinal direction of a rail track, whilst said trolley is
furthermore provided with two further guide members, which are
arranged some distance apart in the intended direction of movement of
a trolley along a rail track.EP-A-0 367 972 shows such a conveying system with a trolley
having four guide rollers arranged in the corner of a rectangle. If
the trolley has to be diverted the guide rollers at one side of the
trolley has to be displaced out of engagement with the rail track,
whereby the guide rollers at the other side of the trolley are guided
in a curved rail track.The object of the invention is to obtain a conveying system
of the above kind wherein a reliable divertion from one rail track to
the other rail track can be realized by simple means, if desired.According the invention this can be achieved in that said
further guide members are furthermore arranged in staggered
relationship with respect to each other, transversely to the intended
direction of movement for cooperating with guide rails and
a switch tongue forming part of said switch device
for diverting said trolley from one rail track to the other, whereby
said guide rails and said switch tongue
are disposed near the connection between said two rail tracks. The invention will be explained in more detail with
reference to the accompanying Figures.
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a part
of the conveying system according to the invention.Figure 2 is a larger-scale view of the switch portion
that is encircled at II in Figure 1.Figure 3 is a larger-scale view of a switch tongue
forming part of the switch device.Figures 4 and 5 are diagrammatic bottom views of a
trolley, with a switch device sketched in, when the trolley passes the
switch device without being diverted from one rail track to another rail
track by the said switch device.Figures 6 - 8 show various stages during the diversion
of a trolley from one rail track to another rail track.Figure 9 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a

<CLAIMS>
A conveying system provided with a rail system (1, 13) with
a trolley (4) or the like, which is movable along said rail system (1,

3) and with a switch device (16), by means of which a trolley (4) can
be diverted from one rail track (1) to another rail track (13)

connected to said first rail track (1), wherein said trolley (4) or
the like is provided with two guide members (7, 8; 9, 10), which are

arranged some distance apart, in the intended direction of movement
(A) of a trolley (4) along a rail track (1), and which cooperate

during operation with a fixed guide rail (6) extending in the
longitudinal direction of a rail track (1), while said trolley (4) is

furthermore provided with two further guide members (24, 25), which
are arranged some distance apart in the intended direction of movement

(1) of a trolley (4) along a rail track (1) characterized in that said
further guide members (24, 25) are furthermore arranged in staggered

relationship with respect to each other, transversely to the intended
direction of movement (A), for cooperating with guide rails (18-20)

and a switch tongue (22) forming part of
said switch device (16), for di
verting said trolley (4) from one rail
track (1) to the other (13), whereby said guide rails (18-21)

and said switch tongue (22) are
disposed near the connection between said two rail tracks (1, 13).
A conveying system according to claim 1, characterized in
that the guide rail extending in the longitudinal direction of a rail

track is formed by a strip-shaped means (6) and the two guide members
cooperating therewith each comprise a pair of rollers (7, 8; 9, 10),

which engage on either side of said strip-shaped guide means (6).
A conveying system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said switch device (16) is provided with guide rails (18, 19),

which can guide the guide members (24, 25) cooperating therewith,
which are connected to said trolley (4), in the longitudinal direction

of said one rail track (1), said switch device furthermore being
provided with further guide rails (20, 21), which include an angle

with the former guide rails (18, 19) of the switch device (16) and by
means of which the guide members (24, 25) connected to the trolley (4) 

can be diverted so as to divert the respective trolley (4) in the
direction of another rail track (13).
A conveying system according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the guide rails (18-21) forming part of

the switch device (16) are comprised of grooves and in that the guide
members (24, 25) connected to said trolley (4), which cooperate with

said grooves (18-21), are comprised of cams, pins or wheels.
A conveying system according to claim 4, characterized in
that a switch tongue (22) is disposed in at least one of said grooves

(18) for the diversion or not of said trolley (4).
A conveying system according to claim 5, characterized in
that said switch tongue (22) is capable of pivoting motion about an

axis (23) positioned near the upper side of said switch tongue (22)
