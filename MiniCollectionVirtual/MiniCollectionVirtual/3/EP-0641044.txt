<ABSTRACT>
The contact arrangement (3) is intended for a plug socket having differential-current protection (residual-current protection). It is a component of a differential-current protective circuit breaker (residual-current device) and has at least one switching point with two contact elements (31, 38; 32, 39). A stationary contact element (38, 39) of the one, or more than one, switching point can be connected via a connecting terminal (11, 12) of the plug socket to an electrical power supply network, and a moving contact element (31, 32) of the one, or more than one, switching point can be connected via a plug contact (21, 22) of the plug socket to an electrical load (V). The moving contact element (31, 32) is mounted in a floating manner. The connecting terminal (11, 12) is designed as a stationary contact element, or is the support of the stationary contact element (38, 39). Such a contact arrangement (3) has a small number of different individual parts, can easily be installed in the plug socket and, during the assembly (installation) of the plug socket at an installation point, can be connected extremely quickly to the electrical power supply network.

Contact arrangement (3) for a mains socket with 
residual current protection, which is installed as a 

component part of a residual current device in a housing 
(8, 9) and has at least one switching point with two 

contact elements (31, 38; 32, 39), of which a stationary 
contact element (38, 39) can be connected via a connection 

of the mains socket to a power supply system and a 
movable contact element (31, 32), which is mounted such 

that it can float, can be connected via a plug contact 
(21, 22) of the mains socket to a current load (V), 

characterized in that the connection, which is provided 
in the form of a terminal (11, 12), is designed as a 

stationary contact element or a carrier of the stationary 
contact element (38, 39), in that the terminal (11, 12) 

is inserted such that it is virtually fixed in position 
in a carrying body (10) arranged in the housing (8, 9), 

and in that the movable contact element (31, 32) is 
designed as a flat bar and is inserted by one of its ends 

into a narrow material recess in the carrying body (10), 
which recess permits a rotary movement of the flat bar. 
Contact arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the movable contact element (38, 39) is 

inserted by its other end into a wide material recess in 
a slide (36) which is guided displaceably in the carrying 

body (10), which recess permits a pivot movement. 
Contact arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the contact spring (33, 34) which applies 

contact force to the movable contact element (31, 32) is 
arranged in the mater
ial recess in the slide (36).  
 
Contact arrangement according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the movable contact element 

(31, 32) is electrically conductively connected, in the 
region of the end inserted into the carrying body (10), 

to a flexible conductor section (121, 122) connected to 
the plug contact (21, 22). 
Contact arrangement according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the movable contact element 

(32), in the region of the end inserted into the carrying 
body (10), forms a terminal contact with an end section 

(761) of a conductor section (76), which is designed as 
a clip, of a test circuit (7) of the mains socket. 
Contact arrangement according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the terminal (11) has a 

terminal housing (15) having a bottom surface supported 
on the carrying body (10) and an opening for introducing 

the conductor (L
3
), which is to be clamped, of the power 
supply system, and also has a terminal spring (14) 

arranged in the terminal housing (15). 
Contact arrangement according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the terminal (11) has an opening (17) for 

introducing a wire release on a top surface remote from 
the bottom surface. 
Contact arrangement according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the wire release has a lug (816) which 

can be guided into the terminal housing (15) and is 
integrally formed on a flexibly designed tongue (815) of 

the housing (8, 9). 
Contact arrangement according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the tongue (815) has a depression (817), 

which is arranged outside the housing, for receiving a 
tool which facilitates the deformation of the tongue 

(815). 
Contact arrangement according to one of Claims 6 
to 9, characterized in that the terminal housing (15) is 

formed by a metal sheet bent into a parallelepiped and 
has, on the side remote from the opening for introducing 

the conductor, a sheet-metal tab (16), for supporting the 
conductor (L
3
) introduced into the terminal housing (15),  
 

and carries the stationary contact element (38) on a side 
surface.
