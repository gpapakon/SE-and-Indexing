<ABSTRACT>
In a contents addressable memory for a fully associative cache memory in 
which address bit values in respect of data to be retrieved from cache are applied to 

the bit lines of respective columns of cells for comparison with the bit values held by 
the cells, a match in any one cell is arranged to forward bias a match line device in 

that cell, the match line devices of a row being connected in cascade, so that if a 
match is obtained along a row a current path is provided along the row to a respective 

current sensing circuit to indicate the match.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to contents addressable memories. In particular though
not exclusively the invention relates to contents addressable memories for use as fully
associative cache memories.Cache memories may be characterised by the number of cache locations into which a
particular block of data may be placed. For example, if a block of data called up from main
storage may be placed in any of four separate locations in a cache memory then the cache is
said to be four way set associative. Caches may range from one way set associative, or direct-mapped
caches, to fully associative, in which a block of data may be placed in any location.Each location in a cache memory comprises an address store location and an associated
data store location. When a processor served by the cache memory issues a new address, the
cache compares this address with any addresses it holds in its address store locations, and if
the new address matches that held in one of the address store locations the data held in the
associated store location is passed to the processor. In a direct mapped cache in which only
one location can possibly hold the required data only one comparison is required. As the
level of associativity increases so does the number of comparisons required, and since these
comparisons must be done in parallel to meet the timing constraints imposed by the processor,
this requires the use of a contents addressable memory.One form of contents addressable memory is described for example in the IEEE
Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Volume 27, No. 5, May 1992, pages 737 to 744, under the title
"A Special-Purpose Content Addressable Memory Chip for Real-Time Image Processing" by
Yong-Chul Shin et al. In particular Figure 7 of that publication shows a similar form of
contents addressable memory cell to that described with reference to Figure 2 of the present 
specification.According to the present invention there is provided a contents addressable memory
comprising a plurality of memory cells arranged in rows and columns, with a respective pair
of data bit lines associated with each column of memory cells, characterised in that each
memory cell includes a match line transistor device, the match line transistor devices of each
row of memory cells being connected in a respective series path to a respective current sensing
circuit and circuit means in each memory cell responsive to a data bit value held by said
memory cell and to a data bit value represented by signals on the respective pair of data bit
lines
