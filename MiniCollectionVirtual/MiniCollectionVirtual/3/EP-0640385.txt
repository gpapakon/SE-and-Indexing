<ABSTRACT>
The packing containing catalysts or adsorbents which is intended for at least one fluid medium has packing elements (10) which are arranged in a stack and comprise layers each arranged longitudinally to the principal flow direction (2). The layers are formed by packing parts (1) the walls (2) of which are permeable to the medium. The packing parts contain a catalyst material (3). Between the packing parts, flow channels are present which cross and are open to each other. According to the invention the layers are each formed by a plurality of packing parts (1), the packing elements (10) have support structures (4) into which the packing parts are laid, and the packing parts are essentially cylindrical.

A packing having catalytic or adsorbent agents for at
least one fluid medium, having packing elements (10)

disposed in stacks, which are assembled from layers
aligned along the main direction of flow (9) of the

medium, wherein the layers are formed by packing parts
(1), which comprise walls (2) permeable for the medium

and contain a catalyst or adsorption material (3), and
wherein between the packing parts are provided flow

ducts, which intersect and are open to one another,

characterised in that
 in each case the layers are formed
by a plurality of packing parts (1),
in that
 the packing elements (10) comprise support
structures (4) into which the packing parts are inserted,
and in that
 the packing parts are substantially
cylindrical.
A packing according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the catalyst or adsorption material
(3) is provided in the form of a bulky granulate.
A packing according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the walls (2) of the packing parts
(1) are made from wire braid or knitted wire cloth.
A packing according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the support structure (4) is made
from a three-dimensional lattice.
A packing according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the support structure (4) takes the
form of a static mixer structure. 
A packing according to one of Claims 4 or 5,
characterised in that
 the support structure (4) is
assembled from faces (41, 42; 51) folded zig-zag

fashion.
A packing according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the packing parts have means
by which they are suspended in the support structure

(4).
A packing according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the support structure (4)
comprises ducts,
and in that
 two or more packing parts are disposed
in linear manner at least in some of the ducts.
A packing according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the walls (2) of the packing
parts are constructed in two layers, whereby the one

layer consists of a fluid-tight membrane permeable
for the medium and the other layer forms a

perforated support structure,
and in that
 the catalyst is present in fluid form.
The use of the packing according to one of Claims 1
to 9 in a fixed-bed reactor for a catalytic

distillation process, in which a catalytic reaction
is combined with a distillation or rectification

process.
The use of the packing according to one of Claims 1
to 9 in an adsorption column.
