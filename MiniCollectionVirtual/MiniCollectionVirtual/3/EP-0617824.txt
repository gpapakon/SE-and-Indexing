<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the field of home 
security systems, and more specifically relates to home 
security systems which monitor a number of access points 
into the home. Home security systems generally monitor all access 
points, such as windows and doors, into a house. Figure 1 
shows a typical floor plan of a house 10 having a security 
alarm system of the prior art. The security alarm system 
included control panel 31, user panels 30A and 30B which 
were connected to the control panel and sensors 25 which 
were also connected to the control panel (connections not 
shown). One typical sensor is shown in Figure 3. A 
typical block diagram is shown in Figure 2. The floor plan indicates that house 10 has two primary 
spaces, rooms 11 and 12. In room 11, there are three doors 
15A, B and C for entering and exiting the room. In room 
12, there is door 15D and windows 20A, B and C. Rooms 11 
and 12 are separated by door 15E. The security system was set up so that one user panel 
was in each space and so that there was one sensor located 
at each door or window. The system was armed using the 
user panels. Typically, a sensor produced a first signal 
if the door or window was closed, and a second signal if 
the door or window was open. The control panel would 
receive these signals, and if the system were armed, would  
 
produce an alarm indication signal if the second signal was received. In the past, a sensor was grouped with all sensors located within 
a single space. Note that in Figure 1, sensors located in room 11 were 
assigned to group 1, while sensors located in room 12 were assigned to 
group 2. To arm the system, an operator would enter an arm command 
at one of the two user panels. Generally, both groups of sensors could 
be armed from either user panel. Still, it was occasionally desirable to arm some points in a space, 
without arming others. It was also desirable to assign a point to more 
than one group assigned to one and only one group, for arming 
purposes. Lastly, it was desirable to have the system provide an 
indication when only a selected group of points was opened. The object of the present invention is defined by Claim 1. Thus the present 
invention is a security control panel and security system which logically 
groups sensors at access points as defined by an operator, not by 
geographic location. The control panel includes an operator means 
which receives inputs from the sensors and initiates an indication 
means if one of the sensors indicates that one of the access

<CLAIMS>
A security system central panel for control of a security 
system having at least two sensors located in a building which produce 

a signal indicative of the position of an access point, an operations 
means (33), to receive inputs from said sensors and to produce an 

output in response to said inputs, indication means (43) for providing 
the operator with an indication of said output, memory (32) connected 

to said operations means, said memory being for storing instructions 
and data used by said operations means,the panel characterised by 

grouping means (34) connected to said memory and said operations 
means, said grouping means storing in said memory operator defined 

groups of the alarm sensors and being operable with such groups 
whereby one or more of said alarm sensors may be in a plurality of said 

groups, said grouping means further modifying said instructions in 
response to said operator defined groups. 
A panel according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
grouping means forms two groups of the alarm sensors as selected by 

the operator. 
A security alarm system for protection of a building having a 
plurality of access points, comprising a plurality of sensors (25), at least 

one of said plurality of sensors being located at each access control 
point to be monitored, said plurality of sensors each producing a signal 

indicative of the position of the access point, indication means (43) for 
providing the operator with an indication of said output and data entry 

means (40) for the operator to enter instructions in to the system, a 
security system central panel connected to each of said plurality of  

 
sensors, the panel comprising an operations means (33), said operation 

means receiving inputs from said plurality of sensors and producing an 
output in response to said inputs and the panel comprising memory 

(32) connected to said operations means, said memory being for storing 
instructions and data used by said operation means, the system 

characterised by grouping means (34) connected to said memory and 
said operations means, said grouping means storing in said memory 

operator defined groups of the alarm sensors and being operable with 
such groups whereby one or more of said alarm sensors may be in a 

plurality of said groups, said grouping means further modifying said 
instructions in response to said operator defined groups. 
A system according to Claim 3, characterised in that said 
grouping means (34) forms first and second groups of the sensors as 

selected by the operator. 
A system according to Claim 3 or 4 characterised in that said 
sensors produce a first signal if the access point is open and a second 

signal otherwise. 
A system according to any of Claims 3 to 5 characterised in 
that said indication means is active only when at least one of said 

plurality of sensors in said selected group produces said first signal.
