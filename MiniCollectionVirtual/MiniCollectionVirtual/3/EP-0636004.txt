<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO HEADWF.ARThis invention relates to the art of judging distance by means of headwear.There are many sporting activities which call for theskill of being able to judge distances easily and accurately. Golf, archery, tennis, bowls, target rifle shooting, darts, are just a fewsporting activities which rely on the skill of the "player" to judge thedistance between himsel /herself and the target accurately, and in some cases as quickly as possible.There are also numerous other activities, including non-sporting, which rely on the skill of the participant to accuratelydetermine the distance between himself/herself and the point at whichit is necessary to calculate the total distance between the two points, ie the person, Point A and the object, or target, Point B.The usual problem when trying to judge distance is toblock out distractions such as objects or movement inside the field of vision of the person A and the perceived object B.In the game of golf, as one example, it is common practice for a player attempting to judge the distance between himselfand the target, being the flag stick, or the hole, to shield distractions to the right or left by using his hands. This practice involves holdingboth hands forward of the eyes in a perpendicular or screeningposition at eye level so as to block out the view to the right and theleft of the target. This action may be carried out with reasonable 

effectiveness without headwear, however, it has been determined thata more effective way of limiting the field of vision by use of thehands only is when the person involved is also wearing headwear.such as sun visor, cap, hat, or other form of headwear which featuresalso a forward portion, commonly referred to as the peak or brim. It is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement which limits the field of vision.In accordance with the invention, an accessory for a person comprises shielding means to shield at least one side of theperson's face, and support means to connect the shielding means tothe person's head.Such an arrangement substantially limits the field ofvision of the wearer without the need for hands, thereby providing a number of advantages. Suitably the accessory is in the form of headwear, thesupport means being a cap or the like which is placed on the top of the wearer's head, whilst the shielding means comprises at least one shield member connected to the cap which shields at least one side of the wearer's face.Preferably the headwear is provided with a front shieldmember,
