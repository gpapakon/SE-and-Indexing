<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic resonance system has a toroidal vacuum 
dewer (22) which holds a superconducting magnet assembly 

(10) which generates a substantially temporally constant 
magnetic field through a central bore (12). A whole body 

gradient coil (30) and a whole body RF coil assembly (32) 
are mounted to a cylindrical member (24) of the dewar. An 

insertable gradient coil assembly (40) is selectively 
insertable into and removable from the bore. The 

insertable gradient coil assembly includes gradient coils 
for selectively generating magnetic field gradients along 

three mutually orthogonal axes, e.g. x, y, and z-axes. A 
flexible cable (42) connects the insertable gradient coil 

with a series of current amplifiers (44). The current 
amplifiers selectively supply current pulses which are fed 

along feed conductors of the cable and which return along 
return conductors of the cable. The feed and return 

conductors are configured such that the net feed and the 
net return current traverse the same effective path in 

opposite directions. Stated mathematically, 

where 

 
is the distance of the i-th conductor from the 

common path, 

 
is the current carried by the i-th 

conductor, and 

 
is the temporally constant magnetic field 

generated by the main magnetic field assembly. Because 
the net feed and return current pulses follow the same 

path, i.e. are coaxial, the net force on the cable from the 
interaction between the current pulses and the temporally 

constant magnetic field is zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic resonance
systems. More particularly the present invention
relates to conveying electrical currents through high
magnetic fields, particularly strong, pulsed magnetic
fields, in magnetic resonance systems. It finds particular
application in conjunction with magnetic resonance
medical diagnostic imaging systems and will be described
with particular reference thereto. However, the
present invention also finds application in other kinds of
magnetic resonance systems in which high magnetic
fields are present.Commonly, magnetic resonance medical diagnostic
imaging systems have a built-in gradient coil surrounding
the patient receiving bore. For imaging smaller
areas of the patient and conducting specialized studies,
insertable gradient coils are sometimes inserted into the
bore. These insertable coils include surface coils, head
coils, biplanar gradient coils, and other gradient coils
which can be received in the main field bore.The insertable gradient coils are powered by current
pulses to generate magnetic field gradients along
selectable x, y, and z-axes. Flexible electrical cables
which extend through the bore from an external current
source to the inserted coil carry these electrical pulses.The cables which carry the current pulses to the insertable
gradient coils for MR imaging must conduct
large currents. The cables must also be able to retract,
i.e. coil and flex, within the bore to allow the insertable
coil to be moved into and out of the magnet. When a
current pases through a conducting cable in the presence
of a strong external magnetic field, as is present
in an MRI magnet bore, an orthogonal Lorentz force is
generated. The Lorentz force, i.e. the force caused by
the interaction of orthogonal components of current and
magnetic fields, causes mechanical displacement of the
cable. The forces can manifest themselves in the mechanical
translational displacements of the cable or may
give rise to torques which cause cable rotation.Mechanical movement of the cable is disruptive and
potentially dangerous to the patient. Further, the movements
cause offensive acoustic noise which can be unnerving
to the patient. Moreover, the movement and torques
cause fatigue of the cable, particularly at the interconnection
betwen the cable and the insertable gradient
coil.In the past, others have used paired, parallel conductors
for insertable gradient coils. Such parallel or biaxial
coils are particularly susceptible to mechanical
movement. The two currents flow along
