<ABSTRACT>
A PCMCIA wireless credit card modem is fabricated using two credit 
card sized sections (12 and 14) interconnected by a hinge (16). The first section (12) 

contains modem circuitry (60), and the second section (14) contains an antenna (82) 
and radio circuitry (86). The two sections form a 90 degree angle in the open 

position. The section with the modem circuitry fits into a type I or II PCMCIA slot 
in a portable computer, and the section with the antenna remains on the outside of 

the computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic assemblies, and more 
particularly to plug-in folding electronic card assemblies. Electronic card assemblies are gaining importance with the expanding 
portable computer market. These small electronic assemblies, which are sometimes 
referred to as PCMCIA devices (Personal Computer Memory Card International 
Association), plug into equipment such as portable computers, palm top computers, 
lap top computers and personal communication devices, to provide additional 
features such as extra memory, extra programming, modem capabilities and 
facsimile capabilities. An example of this type of electronic assembly can be found 
in U. S. patent 5,061,845 entitled "Memory Card". In an effort to expand the use of 
PCMCIA devices, the dimensions of these devices have been standardized. The 
standardization of these devices has broadened their acceptance by the consumer, 
however, the small standard sizes minimize the amount of circuitry that can be 
included in a PCMCIA device. Additionally, with the growing popularity of 
wireless communications, it is desirable to have PCMCIA wireless modems; 
however, prior art PCMCIA configurations do not provide a desirable location for an 
antenna. The present invention provides a folding electronic card assembly that 
satisfies the standard dimensions for PCMCIA devices while providing extra space 
to mount additional circuitry. The additional space not only provides for additional 
circuitry, but it also provides a desirable location for an antenna that supports 
wireless communications. The folding electronic assembly also offers the advantage 
of interfacing to several different size PCMCIA slots. Plug-in folding electronic card assemblies according 
to the invention are defined in claims 1, 5 and 6. An embodiment of the present invention comprises a first section with 
an electronic component and a second section with an additional electronic 
component. A hinge connects the first and second sections so that the sections can 
move between an open position and a closed position. A connector provides an 
electrical interface between the electronic card assembly and a portable computer. In another embodiment of the present invention, a second connector is 
provided so that another electrical interface is provided to the electronic card 
assembly. The second connector is part of the second section of the folding  
 
assembly and the first connector is part of the first section of the folding assembly. In yet another embodiment of
