<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are dye mixtures containing 35 to 90 % by wt., relative to the weight of the dyes, of a dye of formula (I), in which n is 1 and R is C1-C4 alkyl, plus 10 to 65 % by wt., relative to the weight of the dyes, of a dye of formula (I) in which n is 2 and R is C1-C4 alkyl. Also disclosed are dye preparations containing such dye mixtures and the use of the dye mixtures to dye or print on textile fibres or woven fabrics.
