<ABSTRACT>
The present system includes video compact disc 
players (10,12) daisy chained together. The players pass the 

output images from each player as well as commands from 
player to player. A single command input from a single 

source controls is passed down the chain to all players. 
The last player in the chain displays the selected and 

combined images on a single display (16). Image transitions 
such as fades and dissolves are performed using computer 

controlled attenuators and mixers signal. Blinds type 
transitions are accomplished by providing the computer 

with the player synchronization signals allowing the 
computer to appropriately control the attenuators and 

switches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a compact 
disc video presentation system and, more particularly, to 
a system that daisy chains as many players as desired to 
a single display, controls transitions, such as fades, 
dissolves and blinds, between images produced by the 
players and controls image selection by each player. Current audiovisual presentation systems using 
multiple disc based players provide a dedicated display 
for each player. That is, even though multiple images 
are being retrieved and output, the images are being 
retrieved and displayed in parallel and not on the same 
display. U.S. Patent 5,172,242 describes such a typical 
system. Such systems can be modified to allow the 
displays to be switched between images from different 
players, however, such systems require not only a 
switching mechanism but also the addition of memory type 
frame stores for each player. Such systems, because 
on/off switching is being performed, do not have the 
capability of performing more sophisticated image 
transitions such as fades, dissolves and blinds. What is needed is a multiple disc player system 
that will provide sophisticated image transitions such as 
fades, dissolves and blinds without the need for 
additional memory, such as a frame store.  It is an object of the present invention to 
perform fades, dissolves and blind type transitions as 
well as simply switch between images on a single display 
without the need for additional frame store type memory. It is also an object of the present invention 
to provide a system that is controlled from a single 
access port. It is a further object of the present invention 
to provide a system that uses commercially available 
players and simple interconnecting components. The above objects can be accomplished by a 
system in which disc players are daisy chained together 
and pass the output images from each player as well as 
commands from player to player so that a single command 
input from a single source controls all players and 
displays the selected images on a single display. Image 
transitions such as fades and dissolves are performed 
using computer controlled attenuators and mixers which 
control the level of the signal provided by each player 
to the display. Blinds type transitions are 
accomplished by providing the computer with the player 
synchronization signals allowing the computer to control 
the attenuators fast enough to output a signal from one 
player to the display for only part of a display sweep 
and output from another

<CLAIMS>
A video presentation system, comprising: 
   means (18) for controlling selection of and 

transitions between images; 
   a display (16) for displaying an image responsive 

to the single image signal; and 
   at least two daisy chained video compact disc 

players (10, 12) connected between said means (18) for 
controlling and said display (16), retrieving and combining 

at least two images into the single image signal. 
A video presentation system, comprising: 
   means (36) for commanding selection of and 

transitions between images; 
   a first video disc player (30) storing and 

playing images on command; 
   a first player controller (40) coupled to said 

means for commanding and to said first video disc player, 
receiving image selection and transition commands, 

commanding said first video disc player to play an image 
and performing image transitions and producing an output 

image; 
   a second video disc player (32) storing and 

playing images on command; 
   a second player controller (42) connected to said 

first player controller (40) and said second video disc 
player (32) , commanding said second video disc player to 

play an image and performing transitions on the images from 
said first player controller and said second video disc 

player producing a display output; and 
   a display (44) displaying the display output. 
A system as recited in claim 2, wherein said 
second player controller comprises: 

   a computer (66) receiving, decoding and executing 
commands from said command means; 

   a first fade unit (62) connected to said computer 
and said first player controller; 

   a second fade unit (64) connected to said 
computer and said second video disc player; and 

   a mixer unit (68) connected to said first and 
second fade units. 
A system as recited in claim 3, wherein said 
second fade unit comprises series connected and computer 

controlled attenuators (128) and bidirectional switches 
(130). 
A system as recited in claim 4, wherein said 
second player controller further comprises means for 

designating said second player controller as a one of a 
master and a slave unit. 
A system as recited in claim 2, further 
comprising an audio system (294) commanded by said command 

means (278). 
A video presentation system, comprising: 
   a first compact video disc video player (30) 

having a remote control input (38) and an image output 
producing a first image and a synchronization signal; 

   a second compact video disc player (32) having a 
synchronization lock input receiving the synchronization 

signal of said first compact video disc player, a remote 
control input and image output producing a second image;

 
   a computer (36) coupled to the remote control 

input of and controlling selection of images output by said 
first and second compact video disc players, and producing 

a player selection signal; 
   a video signal switch (14) connected to said 

computer and to the outputs of said first and second 
compact video disc players and outputting one of the first 

and second images responsive to the player selection 
signal; and 

   a video display (16) connected to said switcher. 
A multi-player video presentation system, 
comprising: 

   a single display (16) ; 
   at least two video players (30, 32) connected in 

a master slave configuration to said display; and 
   control means (18, 36) for activating each of the 

video players to cyclically play stored images through said 
display.
