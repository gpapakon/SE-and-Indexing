<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum box (38) is provided with recesses (86, 88, 90, 92) on the inner 
surfaces (74, 76) of its front and/or back walls (40, 42) along at least two of its interior 

corners (78, 80, 82, 84); so that, the pressures on opposite sides of the incoming and 
outgoing spans (64
i
, 64
o
) of the web (50) are substantially equalized at discrete locations 
along the lengths of the spans, whereby differential pressure applied to the central curved 

loop (64) between the spans causes the incoming and outgoing spans to remain 
substantially out of contact with the side walls (40, 42). The side walls (44, 46) may be 

provided with chamfers (154, 156) at the interior corners or bores (158; 166-172) and 
ports (160-164; 174-180) to facilitate equalization of the pressure to facilitate equalizing 

the pressure on opposite sides of webs having a transverse curl toward a centerline of the 
box. The box may include web keepers (102) to retain the web during thread-up and a 

removable, sound insulated closure (130). A method of operating such a vacuum box is 
taught.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns vacuum boxes and methods of operating such boxes. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a vacuum box for use in transport systems for 
relatively narrow webs, such as 16 to 35 mm photographic film, the vacuum box having 
features for preventing contact between the web and the side walls of the box. Vacuum boxes have long been used in web transport systems both to control web 
tension and to store loops or lengths of web for release during intermittent operation. 
For example, such vacuum boxes have found particular application in transport systems 
for magnetic tapes where intermittent operation is common. Vacuum boxes have a 
distinct advantage over float roller accumulators in web transport systems that require 
high accelerations of the web. Because float roller systems have substantial mass, their 
considerable inertia can cause unwanted tension spikes in the web during periods of high 
acceleration or deceleration. Such variations in tension can lead to instabilities in some 
transport systems and can also cause damage to the web, such as scratches on 
photographic film. Since vacuum boxes have no moving parts, inertial effects are limited 
to movement of the mass of the web and the air within the box. So, vacuum boxes are 
widely used in web transport systems. Figure 1 illustrates schematically a conventional type of vacuum box 10 which in 
the familiar fashion comprises a back wall plate 12, a front wall plate 14, a pair of side 
wall plates 16, 18 and a bottom wall plate 20. Typically, plates 12 and 14 are parallel, as 
are plates 16 and 18, to define an interior volume of constant rectangular cross section 
which is open at its upper end. However, variations are known in which the space 
between the side walls decreases toward the bottom wall and in which the space between 
the front and back walls increases toward the bottom wall. In any event, all such boxes 
include a vacuum port 22 near the bottom end, through which air is withdrawn from the 
box during operation. A length of web 24, such as photographic film, is fed into the box 
over an infeed roller or air bar or driven vacuum drum or pinch roll 26 and withdrawn 
from the box over an outfeed roller or air bar or driven vacuum drum or pinch roll 28.  
 
The spacing between the front and back walls is chosen to be only slightly larger than the 
width of web 24; so that, when vacuum is applied through port 22, a differential pressure 
is applied across the web to draw the web into the box. Opposed pairs 30, 32,

Vacuum box (38) of the type including a front wall (42); a back wall (40), the front 
and back walls having inner surfaces (74, 76) facing each other; a pair of side walls 

(44, 46) extended between the front and back walls to define a cross section with at 
least four comers (78, 80, 82, 84); means (52, 54) for guiding a length of web into 

and out of a first end of the box, the length having an incoming span (64
i
), a central 
curved loop (64) having transverse outer ends and an outgoing span (64
o
); and means 
(48, 68) for applying vacuum near an opposite end of the box, and comprising means 

for substantially equalizing the pressure on opposite sides of the incoming and 
outgoing spans of the web at discrete locations along the lengths of the spans enabling 

more downward force on the central curved portion of the loop than on the transverse 
outer ends of the central curved portion of the loop which passes over the recesses, 

whereby differential pressure applied to the curved loop causes the incoming and 
outgoing spans to remain spatially separated from and out of contact with the side 

walls, and further comprising means to connect the region in connection with the first 
end to atmospheric pressure, characterized by:
 
said means for substantially equalizing the pressure consisting of a plurality of 

recesses (86, 88, 90, 92) formed in the inner surface of at least one of the front and 
back walls. 
Vacuum box of Claim 1, wherein the recesses (86, 88, 90, 92) are spaced at the 
discrete locations along substantially the length of the incoming and outgoing spans 

near the corners of the at least one wall. 
Vacuum box of Claim 2, wherein the recesses 
(86, 88, 90, 92) 

are formed in the front (42) and back 
walls (40) and the recesses in the front wall are offset axially along the corners (82, 84) from the 

recesses (86, 88) in the back wall. 
Vacuum box of Claim 3, wherein the recesses have a width measured axially of the 
box and the recesses in the front wall are offset axially one half of the width from 

the recesses in the back wall. 
Vacuum box of Claim 2, wherein the recesses extend beyond the corners of the at 
least one wall and are overlapped by the side walls. 
Vacuum box of Claim 2, further comprising a chamfer (154, 156) extended axially 
along each side wall at each corner to facilitate equalizing the pressure on opposite 

sides of webs having a transverse curl toward a centerline of the box. 
Vacuum box of Claim 2, further comprising a corresponding plurality of bores 
(166, 168, 170, 172), one bore extending from each recess into an adjacent side 

wall and a port (174, 176, 178, 180) extending from each bore into the box to  
 

facilitate equalizing the pressure on opposite sides of webs having a transverse curl 
toward a centerline of the box. 
Vacuum box of Claim 2, further comprising a bore (158) extending from each 
recess through an adjacent side wall to a recess in an opposite front or back wall 

and a plurality of ports (160, 162, 164) extending from each bore into the box to 
facilitate equalizing the pressure on opposite sides of webs having a transverse curl 

toward a centerline of the box.
