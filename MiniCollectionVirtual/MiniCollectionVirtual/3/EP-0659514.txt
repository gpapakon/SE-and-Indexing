<ABSTRACT>
An electric discharge machining apparatus for 
machining a workpiece by means of electric discharges 

using a tool electrode (1) spaced from the workpiece (2) 
and defining therewith a machining gap (G), comprising a 

pair of individual cables (L1,L2) with a low capacitance 
and a coaxial cable (L3,L4) with a low inductance to carry 

a train of successive current pulses from a power supply 
to the machining gap. The pair of cables are larger in 

current-carrying capacity than the coaxial cable. A 
current pulse flowing through the pair of cables is 

combined with that flowing through the coaxial cable to 
thereby obtain a total current pulse of a steep slope 

leading edge while preventing undesirable stray 
capacitance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electroerosion 
machine. More specifically, the present invention relates to an 
electric discharge machine ("EDM") for performing electric 
discharge machining on a workpiece using a tool electrode in 
which a train of successive power pulses are supplied. from a 
power supply to a machine body including a machining gap formed 
between the tool electrode and the workpiece. In general, an electric discharge machine includes a 
machine body having a machining gap formed between a tool 
electrode and a workpiece being machined, a power supply for 
supplying electric energy to the machining gap and a dielectric 
supply device for supplying a dielectric fluid, such as kerosine 
or water, to the machining gap. The power supply is necessarily 
positioned with a physical spacing from the machine body and 
connected to the machine body by means of appropriate conductors. A train of successive voltage pulses from the power 
supply are applied across the machining gap to induce electric 
discharges across the machining gap so that a current starts to 
flow through the machining gap, thereby resulting in the 
machining of the workpiece. It is well known to use a coaxial cable, which has an 
inner-conductor and a conductive shield insulated from the 
inner-conductor, to reduce the undesirable self-inductance of the  
 
conductors connected between the power supply and the machine 
body. However, the stray capacitance between the inner-conductor 
and the shield adversely affects the quality of the machined 
surface of the workpiece particularly when a relatively long 
cable is used. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
electric discharge machine which can pass current pulses having a 
steep slope leading edge through a machining gap, thereby 
increasing machining speed even when a power supply is positioned 
at a long distance from a machine body. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
an electric discharge machine which prevents damages on the 
machined surface of a workpiece due to the stray capacitance 
between conductors connected between a power supply and a machine 
body. Additional objects, advantages and novel features of 
the invention will be set forth in part in the description which 
follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the 
art upon examination of the following, or may be learned by 
practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the 
invention may be realized and attained by means of the 
instrumentali
