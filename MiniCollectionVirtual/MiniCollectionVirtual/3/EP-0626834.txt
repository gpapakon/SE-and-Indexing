<ABSTRACT>
Improved polymeric orthopaedic compositions are disclosed wherein sized, functional fibers are incorporated into a physiologically acceptable matrix. The compositions of the invention can be fabricated in the form of particulate powders (10) adapted for reinforcement of bone cements (14), continuous media (12) for such cements (14), and orthopaedic implant coatings (16). A complete implant attachment system is also provided, made up of a fiber reinforced implant coating (16), and a compatible fiber reinforced cement (14). In preferred forms, the fibers (20) have a layer of sizing (22) thereover which is chemically joined both to the surface of the fibers (20) and to the surrounding matrix, and the fibers (20) are present at a level of at least about 6 volume percent. If desired, sized radiopaque particles (24) may be incorporated into the compositions of the invention. The fibers (20) are advantageously polymeric in nature and of intermediate stiffness, whereas the matrix fraction is preferably polymethylmethacrylate.

 BONE CEMENT HAVING CHEMICALLY JOINED REINFORCING FILLERSBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to improved polymeric orthopaedic compositions such as particulate powders, continuous media for bone cements, finished bone cements and orthopaedic implant coatings which are characterized by an amount of physiologically acceptable polymeric matrix with sized fibers dispersed in the matrix such that the sizing layer on the fibers is chemically joined to the surface of the fibers and to the matrix material. In preferred forms, sized radiopaque particles can also be added to the orthopaedic compositions.2. Description of the Prior ArtStarting in the mid-1930s and continuing through the middle part of the 1950s, the orthopaedic implantation of artificial femoral heads, i.e., the ball of the hip joint, was achieved primarily by impaction of the stem of the implant into the medullary (marrow) cavity of the femur. Although this procedure achieved some degree of success in that it increased the mobility of certain patients suffering from hip joint deterioration or mal¬ function, the procedure had many shortcomings. The principal problem encountered was traced to loosening of the implant in a relatively few years, thus compromising the patient's mobility and oftentimes causing significant pain.In the late 1950s, Dr. John Charnley in England proposed use of a mortar or grouting agent for cementing an orthopaedic appliance to a patient's bone structure using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as the grout agent. The PMMA mortar material served to fill all of the spaces 

 between the stem of the implant and the surrounding bone. In particular, it was determined that the PMMA grouting agent could be forced into the tiny interstices of the porous bone. This resulted in a mechanical lock of the 5 grout agent to the bone. Another advantage of the PMMA system was the fact that mobilization of the patient following implantation could be accomplished at an earlier date following surgery, and the functional lifetime of the implant was greatly enhanced.10 The success obtained in hip surgery using PMMA encouraged orthopaedic surgeons to develop implant attach¬ ment techniques for other prostheses such as the acetabu- lar or cup side of the hip joint and for the femoral, tibial and patella components of total knee replacements.15 Although the life time of these prostheses has markedly improved and the range of patients for which the surgery is deemed appropriate has greatly increased, difficulties
