<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heterogeneous custom made knitted
fabric for lining the surfaces of molds.In designing new models of vehicles more and more attention is
being paid to the aerodynamic profile of the body, especially of
the windshields and rear windows. These windows, therefore, are
requiring curved plate shapes with increasingly more complex zones
of curvature and with, for example, transitions from two to three-dimensional
areas of curvature. The thermoshaping of the custom
cut glass plates is carried out in a known manner by heating the
flat glass plates to a temperature at which they become sufficiently
pliable to be transformed in a mold with the desired
curved surface into the desired curved window shape.It is known, for example from the French patent application
no. 2.606.398, to cover the surfaces of the hard metal mold with a
lining layer that forms a cushion in order to avoid irregularities
in the window surface during the thermoshaping. Fiber glass and
metal wire fabrics, as well as combinations of the two, can be
used for this purpose.It is further known from EP-A-0477785 to cover the surface of a
glass shaping mould by a knitted fabric from yarns comprising
stainless steel fibers. In figures 6 (a) and 6 (b) laminated
structures are shown where the knitting pitch differs from one
layer to another in the laminate.The demands being made on these liner fabrics continue to increase
as a consequence of the necessity of creating ever more complicated
curved surfaces in the glass plates. Insofar as parts of the
liner fabrics extend over the edges of the mold or over zones with 
strong or three-dimensional curvature or over the remaining parts
of the mold surface, their strength, wear resistance, transverse
compressibility, bending resistance and/or extensibility in the
surface will have to be adapted for each zone, area or part of the
surface. On the concave side of the curved window, the window
edges are increasingly being given a layer of colored enamel. With 
the thermoshaping process in the mold it is necessary to ensure
that the enamel layer does not adhere to the knitted fabric edges
situated opposite it. To accomplish this, the knitted fabric
lining these edges may therefore require extra structural adaptations.The invention contributes to solving this problem by providing a
custom knitted fabric for lining mold surfaces; the fabric comprises
thereby predetermined zones with different knitting
patterns as defined in claim 1. The expression "knitted fabric comprising zones with
