<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device having a plurality of electrodes is prepared for bonding with another electronic device by positioning metal bumps surrounded by a resin on selected electrodes. The bumps are then diamond turned to that the outer surfaces of all of them lie substantially in a plane. The resin is then removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLANARIZING BUMPS FOR INTERCONNECT ÎªG MATCHING ARRAYS OF ELECTRODESField of the Invention The invention concerns interconnecting arrays of electrodes of two electronic devices, e.g., connecting pads of a semiconductor device to a matching pattern of traces and/or pads on a printed circuit board or an interconnect. In particular, it relates to an improved process for preparing metal bumps on the electrodes of one electronic device for use in such interconnecting.Background of the InventionElectronic devices are becoming smaller and more complex, e.g., having larger numbers of electrodes of finer pitch. Hundreds of individual connections between two electronic devices must be made across areas that may be about a square centimeter in area or even smaller. For example, a semiconductor device may have a large number of electrodes or contact pads, as they are known, to be connected individually to another set of electrodes such as traces or pads on an interconnect or circuit board. For purposes contained herein, the term "electronic device" will be understood to refer to active semiconductor integrated circuits as well as circuit boards and interconnects on which such circuits are to be mounted and test coupons for testing such circuits.One method of making such connections involves forming a metal bump on each pad of the semiconductor device or appropriate traces or pads of the interconnect or circuit board. Preferably the bumps are formed on the traces or pads of the interconnect to reduce the number of processing steps, and resultant yield loss, on the more sensitive semiconductor device.After aligning each bump with an electrode to which it is to be bonded, the two devices can be bonded by applying pressure and/or temperature to provide electrical contact between each aligned pair of electrodes. Such electrical contact may be maintained by a metallurgical bond, by an adhesive, or simply by maintaining the exerted pressure. 

 The bumps can be of a variety of metals, but are commonly of gold because of its high electrical conductivity as well as its corrosion resistance.The bumps can be electroplated directly onto the electrodes or, as suggested in United Kingdom Patent Specification No. 1,243,097 (Gurler), they can be formed on a temporary substrate and then transferred and bonded to the electrodes. Transferring protects the electronic device from damage that might otherwise result from the cleaning and plating solutions normally used in the formation of the bumps.
