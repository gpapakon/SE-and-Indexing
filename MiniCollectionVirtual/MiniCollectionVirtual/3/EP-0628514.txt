<ABSTRACT>
In a method for preparing a high α-type 
silicon nitride powder by adding to and mixing 

with metallic silicon powder a copper catalyst 
and nitriding the mixture in a non-oxidizing 

gas atmosphere containing nitrogen or ammonia at 
1,000 to 1,500°C, the amount of copper catalyst 

is limited to from 0.05% to less than 0.5% by 
weight of copper based on the weight of the 

metallic silicon. There is obtained silicon 
nitride powder of high purity at low cost and 

high efficiency since the copper catalyst can be 
efficiently removed from the silicon nitride 

powder through conventional acid treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to methods for preparing 
high alpha-type silicon nitride powder. There is expected an increasing demand for 
sintered silicon nitride as refractory 
structural material since it has excellent high-temperature 
strength, thermal shock resistance 
and corrosion resistance. In particular, 
silicon nitride powder having an alpha-type 
crystalline phase content (to be referred to as 
α-conversion, hereinafter) of 90% by weight or 
higher is designated high alpha-type silicon 
nitride powder and known to exhibit extremely 
high material strength at elevated temperature 
when sintered. Prior art well-known industrial 
methods for the preparation of silicon nitride 
include (1) direct nitridation, (2) reducing  
 
nitridation, and (3) halogenated imidization. 
Most commonly used among others is the direct 
nitridation method which is cost effective. As is well known in the art, the direct 
nitridation method involves exothermic reaction 
to generate heat as much as 176 kcal per mol as 
shown by the following chemical formula. 
3Si + 2N2 → Si3N4 + 176 kcal 
It is then desired to restrain vigorous reaction 
to achieve a reaction temperature distribution 
as uniform as possible. For a tunnel furnace 
used as a reactor, it was proposed to adjust the 
charge to a tray or to control the heating rate. 
Also Japanese Patent Application Kokai (JP-A) 
Nos. 97110/1986, 266305/1986 and 60410/1991 
disclose the use of a rotary kiln and fluidized 
bed as the reactor for providing a uniform 
reaction temperature. From another point of view, the direct 
nitriding reaction is a gas-solid system 
reaction between gaseous nitrogen and solid 
metallic silicon. It is said that the reaction 
is apparently determined by diffusion of 
nitrogen gas into metallic silicon or into the 
resulting silicon nitride. It would occur to  
 
those skilled in the art to increase the 
reaction temperature or reaction pressure in 
order to increase the diffusion rate. In the 
silicon nitride-forming reaction, however, more 
β-type silicon nitride forms at higher temperature 
and the desired α-type silicon nitride is 
not obtained in a reasonable yield. As to the 
pressure, it is reported that pressure has little 
effect unless it is extremely high (see 
Surface, Vol. 24, No. 7, page 363, 1986). For 
commercial scale production, the use of a 
reactor capable of maintaining such an extremely 
high pressure is neither economical nor 
practical. One well-known measure is to mix 
the reaction gas with hydrogen gas. Also
