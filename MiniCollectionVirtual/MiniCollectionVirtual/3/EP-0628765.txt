<ABSTRACT>
In the headlamp, light reflected from an incandescent or arc source (10) at the nearer focus (FR) of the uniformly elliptical central reflector (21) converges at the outer focus (FS), located at the focal plane (PF) of the lens (40). The lamp front is closed by a plain glass (50). While the outer reflecting zones (22a,22b) also reflect convergently in vertical planes, horizontally reflected rays cross the optical axis (Ox) progressively further forward (h(yc)) as the reflection point lies further out (yc). The beam appears at the focal plane as a bright central spot with lateral extensions of approximately uniform height. To produce cut-off, a vertical mask (30), with a top edge not extending higher than the optical axis (Ox), is fixed at the focal plane (PF).

Headlight for a motor vehicle, of the type capable of creating a light beam of 
given configuration and including a light source (10), a mirror (20) of the elliptical 

type in the vicinity of the first focal point of which the light source is situated, a lens 
(40) placed in front of the mirror and a closure glass (50) placed in front of the lens, 

the mirror being capable of creating in the area of a second focal point a light spot 
spread out widthways,
 
characterised in that the mirror has in at least one area (22a, 22b) a reflective surface, 

generally smooth and with unbroken gradient, each horizontal section of which 
reflects the radiation emitted by the source towards a multitude of points of 

horizontal convergence (Fc) situated at horizontal distances (h(y
c
)), measured along 
the optical axis (Ox) of the headlight in relation to a focal plane (PF) of the lens, 

which vary according to the distance (y
c

relation to the optical axis of the mirror, and each vertical section of which reflects 

the radiation emitted by the source towards points of vertical convergence situated in 
proximity to the said focal plane of the lens,

direction. 
Headlight according to Claim 1, characterised in that, in at least one other area 
(21) of the mirror, each horizontal section of the reflecting surface reflects the 

radiation emitted by the source towards a point of invariable horizontal convergence 
(FS), this area having, in a horizontal plane (xOy) containing the light source, an 

elliptical reflecting surface profile.

front of the mask. 
Headlight according to Claim 4, designed to create a dipped beam delimited by a

convergence (Fc) is from the focal plane (PF) of the lens. 
Headlight according to Claim 4, designed to create an anti-fog beam delimited by 
a cutoff and having a generally homogeneous illumination over an extended width,

is to the focal plane (PF) of the lens.
