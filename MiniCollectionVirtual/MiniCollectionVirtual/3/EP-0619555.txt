<ABSTRACT>
Multiple color objects are optimally rendered in a single print job, such that, for example, 
the rendering of presentation graphics images may be carried out differently than the 

rendering of sampled images, by use of remapped graphics paint operators and a 
plurality of color rendering dictionaries that operate in the interpretation of a page 

description in a computer-based publishing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent Application SN 017,198, entitled 
"Method and Associated Apparatus for Transforming Input Color Values In An Input Color 
Space to Output Color Values In An Output Color Space" bearing the Assignee's Docket 
No. 67,248, and to U.S. Patent Application SN 017,094, entitled "Method For Cross-Device 
Color Calibration And Enhancement Using Explicit Constraints", bearing the 
Assignee's Docket No. 66,561, both filed on February 12, 1993, the contents of which 
are disclosed herein by this reference. The present invention is directed to the field of digital image processing and more 
particularly to the rendering of multiple objects in a page description by an image 
rendering device. In the processing of images to be printed by a computer-based printing and 
publishing system, a page description language serves as the interchange standard for 
transmission and storage of a printable or displayable document that is generated by use 
of an application program. An associated page description language interpreter, typically 
installed in a specific raster output device, then interprets the page description and 
causes the page to be rendered on the respective output device. Facilities for outputting graphical objects in a page description are divided 
between color specification facilities and color rendering facilities. In the former, the 
abstract colors and shapes of an object are first specified in a device-independent way, 
according to a predefined color space. Then, the description of the object is processed in 
a device-dependent way so as to cause the object to be rendered on the page. However, in the step of interpreting the color values of a graphical object, there is 
no differentiation between the color values of an object that represents a graphical shape, 
and the color values of an object that represents a sampled image. As a result, an object 
that is a graphical shape (in the form of, for example, a bar chart, graph, or other 
presentation graphic) is rendered poorly if the rendering step is optimized for reproduction 
of another type of object, such as one in the form of a sampled image. Alternatively, an 
object that is a sampled image (in the form of, for example, a photograph or other bit-mapped  
 
image) is rendered poorly if the rendering is optimized for the color values of an 
object in the form of a graphical shape. The resulting print, or other hard copy output of 
the rendered page, is then considered to be of lesser color quality than is

<CLAIMS>
A method for optimal color rendering of multiple objects in a page description, the 
objects having object types, comprising the steps of: 


a) providing a plurality of color rendering dictionaries, wherein each dictionary 
may be used to implement a particular color transformation of the color values of an 

object to be rendered; 
b) establishing a first painting operator for the painting of a graphical shape object 
type; 
c) remapping the first painting operator to cause the rendering of objects being of 
the graphical shape object type to be implemented according to a first one of said color 

rendering dictionaries; 
d) establishing a second painting operator for the painting of a sampled image 
object type; and 
e) remapping the second painting operator to cause the rendering of objects 

being of the sampled image object type to be implemented according to a second one of 
said color rendering dictionaries. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the first painting operator is the PostScript 
setcolor operator. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the second painting operator is the PostScript 
image operator. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for printing a reflection print. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for printing a transparency. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for a presentation graphics image quality color 

rendering mode. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for a photographic image quality color rendering 

mode. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for a colorimetric matching color rendering mode. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for a color morphing color rendering mode. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the color transformation in at least one of said 
color rendering dictionaries is optimized for an Adobe PostScript Level 1 color rendering 

mode. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of the color rendering dictionaries is 
based on a the combination of one or more of: a cascaded series of 3 x 3 color 

transformation matrices, a group of three-dimensional trilinear interpolation look up 
tables, or one-dimensional color transform functions. 
The method of claim 1, wherein each color rendering dictionary is associated with 
the combination of one or more of the following: a predetermined print mode, a 

predetermined color rendering mode, and an object type.
