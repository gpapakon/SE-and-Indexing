<ABSTRACT>
In a measuring instrument adapted to carry out the reaction 
treatments of a plurality of measuring units in a time-wise duplicated 

manner, the time required for these measuring units to conduct 

measuring operations is reduced by determining in advance the length 
of time in which reaction treatments are to be conducted, dividing 

pretreatment operations into sections when the sum of the lengths of 
the time required to carry out a plurality of pretreatment operations by 

a pretreatment apparatus is larger than a predetermined length of time, 
and carrying out collectively earlier pretreatment operations among the 

divisional pretreatment operations prior to a series of treatments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measurement 
apparatus, more particularly to a measurement apparatus 
which includes plural measurement units and carries out 
various measurement in an overlapped manner over the 
passage of time. From past, an optical measurement method is 
known for a measurement apparatus. The method employs a 
slab-type optical waveguide. The method excites labeled 
fluorescent bodies which exist in vicinity of the 
surface of the optical waveguide using evanescent wave 
component from the optical waveguide. To actualize the 
optical measurement method, an apparatus is proposed as 
is illustrated in Fig. 15. In the apparatus, a test  
 
liquid housing chamber 92 is formed in one body at one 
face of a slab-type optical waveguide 91. An exciting 
light radiated from a laser light source or the like, 
which is not illustrated, enters into the optical 
waveguide 91 through a dichroic mirror 93. Fluorescent 
light radiated from labeled fluorescent bodies exits 
through the optical waveguide 91, and is radiated by the 
dichroic mirror 93 so as to be introduced into a 
detector 95 through an optical filter 94. When the above-mentioned arrangement is 
employed, antibodies 96 which were previously fixed on a 
surface of the optical waveguide 91. Antigens 97 in a 
test liquid then bound by the antibodies 96, then 
fluorescent labeled antibodies 98 which are made by 
labeling antibodies with fluorescent bodies are bound by 
the antigens 97. That is, the quantity of bound 
fluorescent labeled antibodies 98 is determined based 
upon the quantity of antigens 97 in the test liquid. 
And, an evanescent wave component is obtained by 
intruding an exiting light into the optical waveguide 
91. Only label fluorescent bodies 98a of the bound 
fluorescent labeled antibodies 98 are excited by the 
evanescent wave component so that the label fluorescent 
bodies 98a radiate fluorescence. Therefore, the 
intensity of radiated fluorescence is in proportion to  
 
the quantity of the antigens 97 in the test liquid. 
Further, the fluorescence is guided in the optical 
waveguide 91. Consequently, existence or non-existence 
or a degree of immnoreaction is measured by reflecting 
only the guided fluorescence by the dichroic mirror 93, 
cutting off the exciting light component with the 
optical filter 94, and introducing e fluorescence into 
the detector 95. To perform an immunological measurement using 
the fluorescence immunological measurement apparatus 
having the above-mentioned arrangement, pre-processing
