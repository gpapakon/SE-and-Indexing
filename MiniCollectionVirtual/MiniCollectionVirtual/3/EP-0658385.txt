<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a forging machine with, in particular, four rams which are arranged in one plane in an X shape with a 90 DEG offset relative to one another, act radially on the workpiece, the latter being guided longitudinally along the system axis, are fitted with tools and are guided in a frame. The rams are driven by piston/cylinder units, which are supported by crossmembers connected to the frame. For technical reasons connected with casting, the frame is made up of parts. It is the object of the invention in this context to execute the division in such a way that a high-quality frame can be manufactured at a cost which is reasonable taking into account the overall manufacturing process. To achieve this object, the invention proposes to form the frame (1) from four yokes (22) with parallel connecting surfaces and from four V-shaped intermediate pieces (23, 24) with connecting surfaces situated at 90 DEG  to one another, the yokes (22) being designed to take the drive and guide units for the rams (ram guide, piston/cylinder units for the working stroke and return stroke of the rams, adjusting means for the end position of the stroke).
