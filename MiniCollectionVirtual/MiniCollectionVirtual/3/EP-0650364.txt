<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for purifying Factor IX from an impure protein fraction containing Factor IX. The purification process comprises the steps of adding a solvent and a detergent to an impure protein fraction and incubating the solvent/detergent protein solution to inactivate any viral contaminants. Factor IX is purified from the solvent/detergent protein solution by chromatography on a sulfated polysaccharide resin without first removing the solvent and detergent prior to the purification on the sulfated polysaccharide resin. The Factor IX, purified by the process has a specific activity of at least 85 units/mg.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method useful for
separation of Factor IX from an impure protein fraction
which includes Factor IX.The initiation of blood clotting is by two
different, yet similar, molecular mechanisms called the
intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, or
cascades. The intrinsic pathway involves factors that
are normally found in the blood. The extrinsic pathway
involves tissue factors in addition to blood components.
In each of the reaction steps of the two cascades, a
proteinase converts an inactive zymogen into its
enzymically active form. In the last step of the
cascade, which is the same in both the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways, inactive prothrombin is converted to
thrombin, which in turn catalyzes the conversion of
soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin.Factor IX participates in the cascade of events
that lead to blood coagulation. Specifically, Factor
IX, when activated by the action of Factors XIa or VIIa,
activates Factor X to Xa. Factor Xa in turn activates
Factor II (prothrombin) to Factor IIa (thrombin). The
activated Factor II then activates fibrinogen to form 
the fibrin polymers of the blood clot. A deficiency in
the activity of any of the factors involved in blood
clotting leads to an inability of the blood to clot
properly or to longer-than-normal clotting times. For
example, Factor IX is absent or deficient in patients
who have a condition identified as "Hemophilia B."
Thus, the blood of Hemophilia B patients does not clot
properly. Factor IX is administered to Hemophilia B
patients to provide sufficient Factor IX, to return the
clotting ability of their blood to as close to normal as
possible.Commercially available Factor IX concentrates
frequently include other blood factors in addition to
Factor IX. For example, some such preparations comprise
the prothrombin complex which includes Factors II, V,
and X in addition to Factor IX.The occurrence of thrombotic complications, such as
deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, and pulmonary embolism have been reported
in patients treated with prothrombin complex
concentrates or in Factor IX preparations that are
contaminated with Factor II and/or Factor X. These
complications are frequently seen in premature infants,
in patients with poor liver function, and in surgery
patients. Such complications have also been observed in
Hemophilia A patients receiving prothrombin complex
concentrate as a Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing agent.The thrombogenic component of prothrombin complex
concentrates has

<CLAIMS>
A process for purifying Factor IX from an impure protein fraction containing Factor
IX, the process comprising the steps of:


providing an aqueous solution of the impure protein fraction;
adding a solvent and a detergent to the impure protein fraction to form a
solvent/detergent protein solution;
incubating the solvent/detergent protein solution to inactivate any viral contaminants
present in the solvent/detergent protein solution;
adding barium chloride to the incubated solvent/detergent protein solution to
precipitate Factor IX therefrom;
recovering and dissolving the barium chloride precipitate in an aqueous solution;
applying the dissolved barium chloride precipitate solution to a chromatographic
column containing a hard resin selected from the group consisting of silica, methacrylate-glycerol

copolymer, polystyrenedivinyl benzene, and polyvinyl copolymer, said hard resin coupled with a
sulfated polysaccharide capable of binding Factor IX, such that the Factor IX in the dissolved barium

chloride precipitate solution binds to the resin via the sulfated polysaccharide;
washing the column so as to remove the solvent/detergent from the Factor IX bound
to the resin; and
eluting the bound Factor IX from the chromatographic column.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the detergent comprises monooleate.
The process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the detergent is present at a
concentration of about 10% (wt/wt).
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the solvent comprises tri-(n)butyl
phosphate.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the solvent is present at
a concentration of about 3% (wt/wt).
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the solvent/detergent
protein fraction is incubated for about 6 hours at about 27Â°C.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the sulfated polysaccharide
is heparin.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the sulfated polysaccharide
is dermatan sulfate. 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the sulfated polysaccharide
