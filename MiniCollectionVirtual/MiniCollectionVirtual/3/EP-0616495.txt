<DESCRIPTION>
Several known compounds have what can be 
characterized as a cooling activity, and are referred 
to in the art as cooling agents. Cooling agents are 
perceived as cold or cool when contacted with the 
human body and, in particular, with the mucous 
membranes of the mouth, nose and throat. An example 
of one such compound is 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol, 
which is the subject of U.S. Patent No. 4,459,425. The present invention is directed to novel 
compositions comprising 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol 
codried with a food acceptable, water-soluble carrier. 
These compositions can be used in chewing gum to 
improve the "cool" sensation perceived upon chewing 
the gum. In WO93/00018 we have described a chewing gum 
containing an inclusion complex formed between 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol 
and cyclodextrin. The present invention is directed to novel 
chewing gum containing novel compositions comprising 
3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol codried with a food 
acceptable, water-soluble carrier. In one embodiment of the present invention, there 
is provided a chewing gum which is free of the 
undesirable gum base softening effect associated with 
the use of 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol comprising a 
codried composition comprising 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol 
codried with a carrier, said carrier not 
being cyclodextrin. In a second embodiment there is 
provided a method of making a chewing gum which is 
free of the underside gum base softening effect 
associated with the use of 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol 
comprising the following steps: providing a  
 
quantity of chewing gum base; providing a quantity of 
flavour; providing a quantity of a codried composition 
comprising 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol codried with a 
carrier said carrier not being cyclodextrin. The carrier must be capable of functioning as a 
carrier for 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol, and be of 
food acceptable quality. That is, it must be suitable 
for human consumption. The carrier should also be 
water-soluble. Preferably, the carrier is selected 
from the group consisting of maltodextrins, modified 
celluloses, carbohydrate gums, sugars, sugar alcohols 
and mixtures thereof. More preferably, the carrier is 
selected from the group consisting of maltoxdextrins, 
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, gum arabic, corn syrup 
solids, sorbitol and mixtures thereof. Even more 
preferably, the carrier comprises maltodextrin. Most 
preferably the carrier comprises hydroxypropylmethycellulose. Preferably, the chewing gum will contain an 
amount of the codried
