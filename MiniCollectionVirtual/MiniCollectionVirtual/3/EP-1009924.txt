<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a catalyst support assembly comprising a housing (1) wherein is arranged a catalyst support body (4). The catalyst support body (4) comprises a plurality of channels, mutually separated by separating walls (7), extending in the axial direction of the catalyst support body (4). Said housing (1) extends, at least partially, in the axial direction of the catalyst support body (4). The housing (1) comprises at least one flange (5) radially oriented outwards and enclosing, at least partially, the catalyst support body (4). Said flange (5) can be placed between an internal combustion engine cylinder head (16) and manifold (20). The design of the catalyst support assembly enables the catalyst support body to be mounted in the engine compartment.
