Finger sieve, more especially for use in rubble
processing plants, in refuse processing plants and in

sieving humus and peat, which sieve has a plurality of
fingers disposed in the direction of conveyance and

situated with spacings therebetween transversely
relative to said direction of conveyance, said fingers

being detachably retained by a girder, a beam or the
like (1) and oscillating during the conveyance of the

material to be sieved, the fingers (3) being retained in
at least one supporting member (2), which is detachably

secured in the girder, in the beam or the like (1),

characterised in that the supporting member (2) tapers
outwardly, i.e. towards the fingers, and is retained,

clamped in position, in a profile which is open towards
the fingers (3) and forms the girder, the beam or the

like (1), by at least one bar (9), which is detachably
connected to the profile.
Finger sieve according to claim 1, characterised
in that the fingers (3) are formed from resilient

material, and in that the bar (9) is widened outwardly
and communicates with the supporting member (2) by means

of a common inclined face.
Finger sieve according to claim 1,
characterised in that at least some of the fingers (3)

are interconnected in groups or all of the fingers (3)
of one row are interconnected by means of the supporting

member (2).
Finger sieve according to claim 1,
characterised in that the girder, the beam or the like

(1) has a U-shaped cross-section, and in that the 
supporting member (2) is formed from plastics material,

in which the fingers (3) are integrally moulded.
