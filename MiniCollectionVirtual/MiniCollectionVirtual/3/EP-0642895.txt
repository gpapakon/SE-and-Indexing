<ABSTRACT>
A flip-over saw (10) is disclosed, which consists 
of a saw assembly (20) mounted on a table (16) through 

a pivot (28) on a pivot member (26) which is itself 
pivoted about an axis (92) to a pivot block (27) fixed 

on the table (16). Pivot (28) enables the saw assembly 
(20) to pivot up and down to cut work-pieces supported 

on the table (16) against a fence (17). To enable 
bevel cuts to be effected on the workpieces, the saw 

assembly (20), through its pivot member (26), is 
pivotable about the axis (92). The pivot member (26) 

has a projection (88) which is received in a 
semi-circular slot (90) in the table (16). The 

projection (88) is retained at the centre of rotation 
of the pivot member (26). The pivot member (26) is 

supported on a segment of the pivot block (27) and 
secured thereto by a bolt (170). The pivot member (26) 

has an arcuate slot (173) through which to receive the 
bolt (170). The axis (92) is located between the 

table's upper and lower surfaces, and the use of the 
bolt (170) and slot (173) combination together with the 

projection (88) provides improved stability of the 
bevel pivot.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chop saws and 
particularly to a combination mitre and table saw, 
otherwise known as a flip-over saw. In particular, the 
invention relates to such a saw which is capable of 
making bevel cuts in both its table saw mode and mitre 
saw mode. Mitre saws usually, and table saws always, require 
a slot to be provided in the workpiece support or 
table, through which the saw blade will pass. In a 
mitre saw, the saw blade passes through the slot in the 
workpiece support once it has cut through the 
workpiece; in a table saw, the saw blade is mounted 
below the workpiece support and passes through the slot 
so as to present a cutting edge above the workpiece 
support, to which the workpiece may be presented. In 
order to keep to a minimum any damage which is done to 
the side of the workpiece which is adjacent the 
workpiece support as the saw blade emerges from the 
workpiece, the slot in the workpiece support is 
generally to be kept as narrow as possible. When a saw, whether it be a mitre saw or a table 
saw, is capable of making bevel cuts at a variety of 
different bevel angles, the slot in the workpiece 
support must be capable of accommodating the saw blade 
at any one of that variety of angles. Since the 
critical width of the slot in the workpiece support is 
its width at the surface of the workpiece support which 
is actually supporting the workpiece, namely the upper 
surface, the requirement for minimal damage to the 
workpiece has led to the axis about which the saw blade 
pivots, in order to alter the bevel angle at which it 
is cutting, being arranged to coincide with the upper 
surface of the workpiece support. An example of a 
mitre saw which includes such an arrangement is  
 
described and illustrated in US-A-4537105. In that 
saw, the workpiece support includes a bearing block 
having a part circular guide slot. The saw blade 
mounting includes a similar bearing block and the two 
bearing blocks co-operate to allow relative arcuate 
movement about the centre of curvature of the guide 
slot. The centre of curvature of the guide slot 
coincides with the top of the slot in the workpiece 
support. US-A-4531441 illustrates and describes a 
combination table and mitre saw, i.e. a flip-over saw, 
which utilizes a similar bevel pivot arrangement. In 
this saw, the bevel axis of the saw blade is arranged 
to coincide with the upper surface of the workpiece 
support when the saw is operating as a table saw. 
Consequently, when the saw is operating as a mitre saw, 
the

<CLAIMS>
A saw comprising a frame, a table mounted in the 
frame having first and second substantially planar 

parallel opposed table surfaces, the table being 
pivotable in the frame between two positions, a pivot 

block mounted on said first surface, a pivot member 
pivotally mounted on said pivot block for pivoting 

about a first axis substantially parallel and within 
the confines of said first and second surfaces, a saw 

assembly mounted on said pivot member and comprising a 
saw blade lying in a plane containing said first axis, 

a slot in the table adapted to receive said blade to 
enable cutting of workpieces supported on either 

surface of the table, and clamp means to clamp said 
pivot member and block together, wherein said first 

axis is defined by first and second opposed arcuate 
pivot surfaces between said pivot member and one or 

both of said table and pivot block, at least the first 
pivot surface being defined between said first and 

second table surfaces. 
A saw according to claim 1, in which said pivot 
surfaces comprise a bore in a projection of said pivot 

member and a pin spanning a slot in the table, said 
projection being received in said slot. 
A saw according to claim 1, in which said first 
pivot surface is defined by a part substantially 

cylindrical surface of a projection of said pivot 
member and a part substantially cylindrical surface of 

a recess formed in said table, said projection being 
received in said slot.

pivot surface comprises another part substantially 

cylindrical surface on said projection and a part
