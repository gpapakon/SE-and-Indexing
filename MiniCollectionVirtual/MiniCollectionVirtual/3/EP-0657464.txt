<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 9a-N-(N'-carbamoyl) and 9a-N-(N'-thiocarbamoyl) 
derivatives of 9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A, novel semisynthetic macrolide 
antibiotics of the azalide series having an antibacterial action of the general formula 
(I) 
 
wherein R represents a C1-C3 alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group and X represents O or S, to 
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof with inorganic or organic acids, to 
a process for the preparation thereof, to a process for the preparation of the 
pharmaceutical compositions as well as to the use of pharmaceutical compositions 
obtained in the treatment of bacterial infections. Erythromycin A is a macrolide antibiotic, whose structure is characterized by a 14-member 
macrolactone ring having a carbonyl group in C-9 position. It was found by  
 
McGuire in 1952 (Antibiot. Chemother., 1952; 2:281) and for over 40 years it has 
been considered as a reliable and effective antimicrobial agent in the treatment of 
diseases caused by Gram-positive and some Gram-negative microorganisms. 
However, in an acidic medium it is easily converted into anhydroerythromycin A, an 
inactive C-6/C-12 metabolite of a spiroketal structure (Kurath P. et al., Experientia 
1971; 27:362). It is well-known that spirocyclisation of aglycone ring of erythromycin 
A is successfully inhibited by a chemical transformation of C-9 ketones or hydroxy 
groups in a C-6 and/or C-12 position. By the oximation of C-9 ketones (Djokié S. et 
al., Tetrahedron Lett, 1967; 1945) and by subsequently modifying the obtained 
9(E)-oxime into 9-[O-(2-methoxyethoxy)-methyloxime] erythromycin A 
(OXITHROMYCIN) (Ambrieres, G. S., FR 2,473,525/1981) or 9(S)-erythromycylamine 
(Egan R. S. et al., J. Org. Chem., 1974; 39:2492) or a more complex oxazine 
derivative thereof, 9-deoxo-11-deoxy-9,11-{imino[2-(2-methoxyethxyethylidene]oxy}-9(S)-erythromycin 
A (DIRITHROMYCIN) (Lugar P. et al., J. Crist. Mol. Struct., 
1979; 9:329), novel semisynthetic macrolides were synthetized, whose basic characteristic, 
in addition to a greater stability in an acidic medium, is a better pharmacokinetics 
and a long half-time with regard to the parent antibiotic erythromycin A. In a 
third way for modifying C-9 ketones use is made of Beckmann rearrangement of 
9(E)-oxime and of a reduction of the obtained imino ether (Kobrehel G. et al., U.S. 
Pat. 4,328,334, 5/1982) into 11-aza-10-deoxo-10-dihydroerythromycin A (9-deoxo9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin 
A) under broadening the 14-member ketolactone ring 
into a
