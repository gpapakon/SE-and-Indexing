<ABSTRACT>
A device for the detachable connection of a box with a cover is proposed, in which the box (21) has at least one resilient tongue (25,25') on the end part of which a latching projection (24,24') is integrally formed. This latching projection (24,24') is provided with a sloping face (23) and a latching face (26,26'). The cover (1) has at least one latching projection (3,3') which is provided with a latching face (5,5'). The bottom (14) of the cover is provided, at the location of the latching projection (3,3'), with an opening (6). For the latching of box (21) and cover (1), the sloping face (23) of the latching projection (24) of the box (21) slides along the latching projection (3,3') of the cover (1) until the latching faces (26,5,26',5') of box and cover resiliently interengage. For the unlatching of box (21) and cover (1), a tool inserted through the opening (6) presses on the sloping face (23) of the latching projection (24,24') of the box (21), with the result that the latching faces (26,5,26',5') are parted from one another against the resilience of the tongue (25,25') and unlatched.
