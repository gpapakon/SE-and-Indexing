<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ring binders which hold paper
and the like for loose-leaf binders, files, folders and the like.Carrier rails in prior art ring binders have the
tendency, firstly to be bent when a ring member is attached thereto
during assembly, and secondly to twist excessively along the
longitudinal axis of the rail when the ring binder is opened and
closed.US Patent No. 3,246,652 discloses a snap-ring binder
having a strip mounted with a number of ring fingers. The strip is
made of a flexible material and is disposed in a channel. The strip
is also provided with a number of projections engageable with the
sides of the channel. As the strip is wider than the channel, it may
be caused to either bow or arc about the said projections, by acting
upon a pair of tabs of a stiffening rib, to thereby open or close the
ring fingers.GB-A-2 209 500 discloses a ring binder mechanism for
a loose-leaf binder with ring elements secured to carrier rails within
a cover rail. The cover rail is provided with a longitudinal
indentation which provides increased strength and rigidity to the
mechanism.It is an object of this invention to overcome one or
more of the abovementioned problems, and/or at least to provide a
useful alternative. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a
ring binder comprising a housing member, a pair of carrier rails and
a plurality of ring members, the housing member supporting the pair
of carrier rails which are pivotally mounted relative to each other,
each of the ring members being supported by the carrier rails and
extending through the housing member, wherein at least one of the
carrier rails is provided with at least one longitudinal rib.Such an arrangement is particularly useful, since the
provision of ribs prevents any excessive bending occurring when ring
members are attached to the rail during assembly, and secondly
prevents any or excessive twisting movement along the longitudinal
axis of the rail occurring when the ring binder is actually being
opened and closed, thereby allowing for easier closing and opening
of the ring members, since the ring binder is more integral.The bending problem prevents easy assembling of ring
binders by machines, and this leads to wastage of rails of at least
17% during the assembly process. It has been found in tests, that
with the provision of ribs, no rails are wasted whatsoever.Holes may be provided in the rail in order to act as
guiding means for the rail during actual assembly of the ring binder,
and the provision of such holes in

<CLAIMS>
A ring binder (10) comprising a housing member (24), a pair
of carrier rails (32) and a plurality of ring members (14a), the

housing member (24) supporting the pair of carrier rails (32)
which are pivotally mounted relative to each other, each of

the ring members (14a) being supported by the carrier rails
(32) and extending through the housing member (24),

characterized in that at least one of the carrier rails (32) is
provided with at least one longitudinal rib (36).
A ring binder (10) as claimed in Claim 1 further characterized
in that a plurality of said ribs (36) are provided along the

central longitudinal axis of the carrier rail (32).
A ring binder (10) as claimed in either Claim 1 or 2 further
characterized in that said ribs (36) are of the same length.
A ring binder (10) as claimed in either Claim 1 or 2 further

characterized in that said ribs (36) are of different lengths.
A ring binder (10) as claimed in any preceding claim further
characterized in that the rib (36) is provided with a base

which is parallel to the rest of the carrier rail (32). 
A ring binder (10) as claimed in any preceding claim further
characterized in that at least one side (42) of the rib (36) is

sloped relative to the rest of the carrier rail (32) in the
longitudinal direction.
A ring binder (10) as claimed in any preceding claim further
characterized in that at least one side (44) of the rib (36) is

sloped relative to the rest of the carrier rail (32) in the
transverse direction.
A ring binder (10) as claimed in any preceding claim further
characterized in that the rib (36) has four sides (42, 44) which

are all sloped relative to the rest of the carrier rail (32).
