<DESCRIPTION>
 BANDWIDTH SAMPLING TECHNIQUEFOR DIGITAL FOCUSING IN ARRAYIMAGING SYSTEMSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to an array imaging system, and more praticularly to an ultrasonic array imaging system in which ultrasonic echoes reflected from an object to be imaged and received by an array transducer, are focused in a digital fashion by applying one of the bandwidth sampling technique.Background ArtGenerally, in an ultrasonic imaging system, an ultrasonic pulse signal is transmitted toward an object to be imaged, reflected from a surface of acoustic impedance discontinuity of the object, and received by an array transducer. The received signals are then converted into electric signals which are displayed on a video monitor after various processing. The resulting image conveys some information of the characteristics of the object being examined. In this case, the use of a short pulse is to increase the signal resolution and the use of an array is to obtain focusing capability to improve the lateral resolution. In the past, there have been various methods to improve the resolution, in particular, the lateral resolution.FIG.l is a schematic block diagram of a conventional ultrasonic imaging system. An ultrasonic pulse signal generated from a pulse generator 11 is supplied to an array transducer 10 via switch 12. The array transducer 10 converts an electric pulse signal into an ultrasonic signal and provides the converted signal to an object 13 to be imaged. Then, the ultrasonic signal is reflected from an acoustic 

impedance discontinuous surface of the object 13 and the reflected signal is again received by the array transducer 10. At this time, in the case that there are a plurality of acoustic impedance discontinuous surfaces, the ultrasonic signal is in turn reflected from each of discontinuous surfaces and is supplied to numbers of transducer elements. The array transducer 10 is composed of a plurality of transducer elements. The ultrasonic signal supplied to the array transducer 10 is converted by transducer elements into an electric signal with magnitude proportional to an intensity of the ultrasonic signal. The electric signal is amplified to the predetermined magnitude in an amplifier 14 via switch 12, processed to a video signal in a signal processor 15, and transmitted to a cathod ray tube (CRT) 16.In such an ultrasonic imaging system, the array transducer of a probe is composed of a plurality of transducer elements to be in the array form. This array form improves the resolution of a
