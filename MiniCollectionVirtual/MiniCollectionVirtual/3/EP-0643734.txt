<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous dispersions and more particularly to aqueous polyurethane dispersions
in which the polyurethane comprises dimer acid and certain low molecular weight cycloaliphatic components.Aqueous polyurethane dispersions which are used as or provide the basis of aqueous-based coating compositions
are well known for the production of coating films on various substrates. They may be used for the provision of e.g.
protective or decorative coatings since polyurethanes, depending on their particular composition, can possess many
desirable properties such as good chemical resistance, water-resistance, solvent resistance, toughness, abrasion-resistance,
substrate adhesion and durability. Dispersion of the polyurethane in the aqueous system has been achieved
either by the use of external surfactants or, more usefully, by including appropriate chain-pendant ionic and/or nonionic
groups in the structure of the polyurethane polymer. In the latter respect, such aqueous polyurethane dispersions are
particularly advantageously prepared (as is by now well-known in the art) by dispersing an isocyanate-terminated
polyurethane prepolymer bearing ionic and/or nonionic dispersing groups into an aqueous medium and then reacting
the prepolymer with an active hydrogen-containing chain extender while dispersed in the aqueous medium. See e.g.
UK Patents 1549458 and 1549459.It is known to obtain particularly high performance aqueous polyurethane dispersions, especially in terms of the
chemical, water, solvent and stain-resistance of coatings derived therefrom, by employing a polycarbonate polyol as
a reactant in the prepolymer formation along with the other components used in the prepolymer synthesis, particularly
always including an organic polyisocyanate. However, polycarbonate polyols tend to be very expensive materials.
Moreover, in our experience their future supply cannot always be guaranteed. In view of this we have sought high
performance alternatives to polycarbonate polyol-based polyurethane aqueous dispersions.We have now discovered novel aqueous polyurethane dispersions of exceptionally high performance which do
not owe their good properties to the presence of a polycarbonate polyol component in the polyurethane.According to the present invention there is provided an aqueous polyurethane polymer(s) dispersion wherein the
polyurethane polymer(s) thereof comprises the reaction product of:
(A) an isocyanate-terminated polyurethane prepolymer in the form of an aqueous dispersion thereof, said
