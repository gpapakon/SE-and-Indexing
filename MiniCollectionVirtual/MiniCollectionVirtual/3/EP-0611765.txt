C₁-C₄ alkyl, C₁-C₄ alkoxy or CF₃; b) cyclohexyl; or c) 
a straight or branched C₁-C₆ alkyl group;
 
T is a branched or straight C₃-C₅ alkylene chain;
 
R₂ is hydrogen or C₁-C₄ alkyl; and the pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof.  The invention also includes within its scope all the possible 
isomers, stereoisomers and their mixtures and the 
metabolites and the metabolic precursors or bioprecursors 
of the compounds of formula (I). In particular the compounds of formula (I) exhibit either 
E or Z isomerism about the oximic double bond. Both the 
single E and Z isomers of the compounds of formula (I) 
and their mixtures are also included within the scope 
of the present invention. A C₁-C₆ group is preferably a C₁-C₄ alkyl group. A C₁-C₄ alkyl group is e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 
butyl or tert.butyl, more preferably methyl or 
butyl. A C₁-C₄ alkoxy group is e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, 
isopropoxy, butoxy or tert.butoxy, preferably methoxy, 
ethoxy or propoxy. A halogen atom is suitably bromine, chlorine or fluorine, 
preferably it is bromine or fluorine. T is preferably a divalent group chosen from -CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-, 
A furanyl group is preferably a 2-furanyl group. A pyrazinyl group is preferably a 2-pyrazinyl group. A pyrimidyl group is preferably or 2- or 4-pyrimidyl 
group. A pyridazinyl group is preferably a 3-pyridazinyl group.  Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of 
the invention include acid addition salts, with inorganic, 
e.g. nitric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, 
perchloric and phosphoric acids, and organic, e.g. acetic, 
propionic, glycolic, lactic, oxalic, malonic, malic, 
maleic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, cinnamic, mandelic 
and salicylic acids, and salts with inorganic, e.g. 
alkali metal, especially sodium or potassium, bases or 
alkaline-earth metal, especially calcium or magnesium, 
bases, or
