<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition and a process 
for inhibiting dye transfer between fabrics during washing. 
More in particular, the present invention relates to detergent 
compositions comprising N-vinylimidazole N-vinylpyrrolidone 
copolymers having low average molecular weight One of the most persistent and troublesome problems arising 
during modern fabric laundering operations is the tendency of 
some colored fabrics to release dye into the laundering 
solutions. The dye is then transferred onto other fabrics being 
washed therewith. One way of overcoming this problem would be to complex or 
adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before they 
have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in 
the wash. Polymers have been used within detergent compositions to 
inhibit dye transfer. One type of such polymers are N-vinylimiidazole homo-and 
copolymers. Examples of said polymers are described in DE 2 814  
 
287-A relates to detergent compositions comprising 0.1 to 10 
wt% water-soluble or water-dispersible N-vinyl imidazole homo-or 
copolymer in combination with anionic and/or nonionic 
surfactants and other detergent ingredients. EP 372 291 relates 
to a process for washing discolouration-sensitive textiles. The 
wash liquor contains anionic/nonionic surfactants and 
watersoluble polymers e.g. (co)polymers N-vinylimidazole, N-vinyloxazolidone 
or N-vinylpyrrolidone. EP 327 927 describes a 
granular detergent additive comprising water-soluble polymeric 
compounds based on N-vinylpyrrolidone and/or N-vinylimidazole 
and/or N-vinyloxazolidone and cationic compounds. DE 4027832-A 
assigned to Henkel discloses electrolyte-free liquid detergent 
compositions comprising zeolite A, nonionic surfactants and dye 
transfer inhibiting polymers. The dye transfer inhibiting 
polymers are homo-and copolymers selected from N-vinylpyrrolidone 
and/or N-vinylimidazole and/or N-vinyloxazolidone. 
Tenside Surf. Det. 28 (1991) 6 studies the ability of polymers to prevent dye transfer and exemplifies detergent compositions comprising N-vinylimidazole-N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymers. These prior art documents describe N-vinyl imidazole 
copolymers as dye transfer inhibiting polymers having a 
molecular weight range from 10,000 to 1,000,000. The preferred 
N-vinylimidazole copolymers that are described have a molecular 
weight from 20,000 to 200,000. 
Unfortunately, the overall detergency performance of detergent 
compositions formulated with said N-vinylimidazole copolymers 
are affected
