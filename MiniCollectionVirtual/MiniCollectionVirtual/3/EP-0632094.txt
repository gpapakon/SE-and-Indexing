<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tires reinforced with
silica and particularly to tires with treads which are
tires having rubber treads which are quantitatively
reinforced with silica. In one aspect, the tread is
comprised of rubber, particularly sulfur cured rubber,
reinforced with a combination of silica and specified
coupling agent and, optionally, carbon black.Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally
prepared with a rubber tread which can be a blend of
various rubbers which is typically reinforced with
carbon black.In one aspect, rubbers are evaluated, selected
and blended for a purpose of achieving desired tire
tread properties and particularly a balance of tire
tread characteristic properties, mainly, rolling
resistance, traction and wear.For various applications utilizing rubber which
requires high strength and abrasion resistance,
particularly applications such as tires and various
industrial products, sulfur cured rubber is utilized
which contains substantial amounts of reinforcing
fillers. Carbon black is commonly used for such
purpose and normally provides or enhances good
physical properties for the sulfur cured rubber.
Particulate silica is also often used for such
purpose, particularly when the silica is used in
conjunction with a coupling agent. In some cases, a
combination of silica and carbon black is utilized for
reinforcing fillers for various rubber products,
including treads for tires. It is important to appreciate that,
conventionally, carbon black is a considerably more
effective reinforcing filler for rubber products, and
particularly for rubber tire treads than silica if the
silica is used without a coupling agent, or silica
coupler as it may be sometimes referred to herein.Indeed, at least as compared to carbon black,
there tends to be a lack of, or at least an
insufficient degree of, physical and/or chemical
bonding between the silica particles and the rubber
elastomers to enable the silica to become a sufficient
reinforcing filler for the rubber for most purposes,
including tire treads, if the silica is used without a
coupler. While various treatments and procedures have
been devised to overcome such deficiencies compounds
capable of reacting with both the silica surface and
the rubber elastomer molecule, generally known to
those skilled in such art as coupling agents, are
often used. Such coupling agents may, for example, be
premixed, or pre-reacted, with the silica particles or
added to the rubber mix during the rubber/silica
processing, or mixing, stage. If the coupling agent

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic tire having a tread which is
comprised of (A) 100 parts by weight of at least

one diene-based elastomer, (B) 25 to 90 phr
particulate, precipitated silica, (C) up to 30 phr

carbon black, and (D) a silica coupler selected from
(i) 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid or from (ii) 95 to 55

weight percent 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid and,
correspondingly, 5 to 45 weight percent bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide;

wherein the weight
ratio of said silica coupler to silica is in a range of

0.01/1 to 0.2/1; wherein the weight ratio of silica to
carbon black is in a range of 3/1 to 30/1; wherein the

total of silica and carbon black is in a range of 30 to
120 phr; wherein the silica has a BET surface area in a

range of 50 to 300 square meters per gram and a
dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of

150 to 300; and wherein the tread is exclusive of any
organo-cobalt compound.
