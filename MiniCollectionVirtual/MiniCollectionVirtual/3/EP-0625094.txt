<ABSTRACT>
A polymer matrix composite structure for electrical purposes is produced by taking a fibre reinforcement substrate (1) to produce a pre-form (4) of a desired shape and configuration, metallising the pre-form to provide an electrically conductive coating for EMC capability, and impregnating the metallised pre-form with resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in polymer 
matrix composite structures of the kind including 
metallised fibres in a polymer material for electrical 
purposes. It is known to produce polymer matrix composite 
structures of the kind set forth by incorporation of 
metal fibres, application of electrically conductive 
coatings to fibres, or incorporation of electrically 
conductive fillers. In the case of the fibre type 
knitted or woven into fabrics, such fabrics, in turn, 
are shaped to the required pre-form configuration. Wet surface metallisation of the polymer matrix 
composite structures reduces the properties and 
stability of the polymer component. Metallised fabrics 
for EMC electro-magnetic compatability suffer from poor pre-form 
capability and poor performance for EMC due to conductivity attrition 
during the formation of the pre-form. It is known, for example from GB-A-2 118 477, to 
use an injection moulding technique for moulding an 
insulating liner onto a metal spool. We are also aware of EP-A-0 074 263 which 
discloses the use of woven fabric reinforced laminates 
comprising filaments of electrically conductive 
material, suitably metal, metal coated fibre glass, 
Kevlar (Registered Trade Mark), or carbon. It is known from US-A-4 522 889 to produce a 
composite material from a woven fabric which is 
metallised under chemical currentless conditions and 
then embedded in a plastics matrix.  
 Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol.9., No. 211, C-300, 
abstract of JP-A-60-77151, discloses a method of 
obtaining metal-coated glass fibres, using electroless 
plating, which are then either individually moulded, 
lined or inserted into a casing or cover or are further 
incorporated into a plastic and moulded into a fibre 
reinforced plastic (FRP) product. According to our invention a polymer matrix 
composite structure of the kind set forth is produced 
by taking a fibre reinforcement substrate, pre-forming 
the substrate to produce a pre-form of a desired shape  
 
and configuration, metallising the pre-form to provide 
an electrically conductive coating for EMC capability, 
and impregnating the metallised pre-form with resin. The metallised fibres may comprise fibres of 
glass, or carbon. We therefore provide a polymer matrix composite 
structure of high mechanical performance since the 
advantageous bulk properties and dimensional tolerances 
of conventional composites are retained, accompanied by 
higher stability of metallisation since the coating is 
protected from the environment. We are
