<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a plate through hole printed circuit board, comprises the steps of: a) forming conductive circuit elements (20) on two opposed faces of a non-conductive substrate (21); b) coating the substrate and circuit elements with a de-sensitising material (22); c) forming holes (23) through the substrate, each hole passing through a circuit element on each of the opposed faces of the board; d) treating the board to render the substrate exposed in the holes receptive to the action of a metallic plating solution; e) removing the de-sensitising material; and f) treating the board with a metallic plating solution to deposit conductive metal (24) in the holes to the desired thickness to provide an electrical connection through each hole between two opposed conductive circuit elements. This may be in two stages, with an initial thin layer of copper being deposited, followed by a main layer of nickel to the desired thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a printed
circuit board of the plate through hole type.Plate through hole (PTH) boards have conductive
circuit elements formed on both sides and interconnected by
holes drilled through the board from a conductive element
on one side to an opposed element on the other side, the
holes having copper or other conductive metal plated
therethrough.Conventionally, PTH boards are manufactured by a
process of the type in which holes are first drilled in the
correct locations through a substrate with copper coated on
both sides, and the board is then given an initial treatment
with an electroless copper plating solution after preparation.
A negative resist image of the circuit elements
is then formed by a conventional imaging process, which is
followed by an electroplating step. The copper areas are
protected by an application of tin, or possibly gold, and
then the resist is removed. Etching of the exposed copper
areas can now take place. Finally, the tin or gold is
removed, leaving the required printed circuit board.The conventional process has the following disadvantages:
1) Copper is plated over the existing copper across
the whole plate at the same time as the plating in the holes.
It is therefore usual to start with a substrate having copper 
layers thinner than required for the eventual conductive
tracks and to attempt to build up to the required thickness
during the plating processes. The result is typically a
wide variation in track thickness, possibly leading to
difficulties with subsequent treatment stages or to excessive
track resistance locally. Further, the electroplating is
costly, increasing the board cost, and can give rise to
inadequate bonding of the plated copper, leading to
delamination in subsequent processing or in use, again
leading to localised high resistance of the tracks.2) The initial electroless plating is not conducted
for a sufficient time to build a continuous layer, and this
can cause the creation of voids during electroplating. These
voids can contain some of the plating solution which, during
subsequent soldering operations, can boil, causing failure
of the copper plating in the hole. This is referred to as
"outgassing".3) The imaging processing to form the conductive
tracks is carried out after the formation of the holes, and
this can lead to contamination of the surface in the holes
before the electroplating. This can again cause outgassing
or lead to an inadequate connection through the holes.4) Since the imaging is carried out
