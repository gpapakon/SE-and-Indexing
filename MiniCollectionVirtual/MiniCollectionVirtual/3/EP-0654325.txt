<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for driving arms of an industrial robot, having a first arm (13) pivotably supported on a support 
member, a second arm (15) pivotably supported on the first arm (13), a ball screw (2) pivotably supported at its base 

portion (21), on which an end portion of a screw member (22) is rotatably supported, on the support member, a nut 
(23) connected to a member for driving the first arm (13) or the second arm (15), in such a manner that the nut 

(23) can be turned, and a motor (3) for turning the ball screw (2), wherein the driving motor (3) is provided in a 
position parallel-offset from the axis of the ball screw (2), the driving motor (3) and ball screw (2) being connected 

to each other by a torque transmission means. This enables the resonance of vibration in a low frequency band to be 
prevented, and the accuracy of paths of robot arms to be maintained at a high level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an industrial
robot.Hitherto, an industrial robot is
adapted, as shown in FIG. 3, for example, so that turning bed 11
capable of turning is provided on base 1, a pair of stands 12
standing straight upwardly are provided on the turning bed 11,
and one end of first arm 13 and one end of drive lever 14 are
rotatably supported. The intermediate portion of second arm 15
is rotatably supported at the other end of first arm 13, one end
of connection lever 16 is rotatably connected to one end of
second arm 15, and the other end of connection lever 16 and the
other end of drive lever 14 are rotatably connected. Thus,
parallel crank mechanism is formed. Moreover, supporting portion
17 is provided at stand 12, and base portion 21 for rotatably
supporting end portion of ball screw 2 is rotatably supported by
the front end of supporting portion 17. Nut portion 23 meshing
with screw portion 22 of ball screw 2 is rotatably connected to
drive lever 14, and drive motor 3 for rotationally driving ball
screw 2 is fixed at the end portion opposite to screw portion 22
of base portion 21 of ball screw 2. Screw side end portion of
ball screw 2 is rotatably supported at the front end of 
supporting plate 24 extending in parallel from base portion 21
to screw portion 22.However, in the prior art, base portion 21 of ball screw 2
is rotatably supported and center of gravity of drive motor 3
exists at position apart from rotation center axis of base
portion 21. Since large weight of drive motor 3 is always
applied to the center of gravity, natural frequency of ball screw
drive system is lowered. In the case where drive motor 3 is
rotated, resonance takes place in the lower frequency region to
allow screw portion 22 of ball screw 2 to undergo displacement
so that it is curved, thus disadvantageously lowering locus
accuracy of the front end of second arm 15.Moreover, there was also the problem that since drive motor
3 is disposed below from supporting portion 17, there occurs the
necessity of allowing height of the entirety of robot to be high.Further, there was also the problem that since drive motor
3 is fixed to the end portion of ball screw 2, in the case where
friction heat produced at brake attached at drive motor 3 or nut
portion of ball screw is cooled, cooling structure becomes
complicated. The closest prior art US-Re-32 794 discloses an industrial robot having the features of the preamble
of claim 1.The EP-A1-0 510 205 and the JP-A-63 001 851 disclose the principle of cooling a
ball screw by a
