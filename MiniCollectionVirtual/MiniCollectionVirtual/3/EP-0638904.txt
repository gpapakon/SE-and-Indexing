<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dual-port memory comprising a dummy memory cell (10') associated with a dummy output line (Bo') and with a precharge transistor, the output of this dummy cell being at "0". A dummy read transistor (M2') is operated by the active state of the read select signal (RC) and connects the output of the dummy cell to the dummy output line. Means (16, 18) are provided for operating the output transistors (M3) of the memory when the state of the dummy output line reaches a threshold for triggering the inverter.

A dual-port memory including:

dual-port memory cells (10) disposed in
columns;
one input line (Bi) per column connected to
each cell (10) of the column through a write transistor

(M1) that is turned on by a respective write line (W);
characterized in that it compri
ses,

   for each input line, a transistor (M4)
directly connecting said input line to a memory input

when any of said write lines (W) is at an active state.
The dual-port memory of claim 1,
including:


one output line (Bo) per column connected to
each cell of the column by a read transistor (M2) that

is controlled by a respective read line (R);
precharge transistors (MP1) connecting the
output lines (Bo) to a precharge voltage (Vdd)

corresponding to a first logic state, said transistors
being turned on by the inactive state of a read

selection signal (RC) ;
output transistors (M3) connecting the
output lines to a memory output (Bo1);
a dummy memory cell (10') associated with a
dummy output line (Bo') and with a precharge

transistor, the output of said dummy cell being at a
second logic state opposite to said first logic state;
a dummy read transistor (M2') turned on by
the active state of the read selection signal (RC) and

connecting the output of the dummy cell to the dummy
output line; and
means (16, 18) for turning on said output
transistors (M3) when the state of the dummy output 

line reaches a predetermined threshold between said
first and second logic states.
The dual-port memory of claim 2, wherein
said means for turning on the output transistors (M3)

include a logic gate (16) having a first input
connected to the dummy output line (Bo') through an

inverter (18) and a second input that receives the read
selection signal (RC).
The dual-port memory of claim 2, wherein
said dummy cell (10') includes a conducting transistor

(10-2) connected to a fixed voltage corresponding to
said second logic state.
