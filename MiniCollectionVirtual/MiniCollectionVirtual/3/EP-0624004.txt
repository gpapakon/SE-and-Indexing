<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated transceiver circuit 
packaged component. One known such component is shown in Figure 1 of the 
accompanying drawings together with an external filter 1. The 
transceiver has two modes of operation, transmit and receive. In 
both modes a local oscillator signal is generated by an on-chip 
voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 3. In the receive mode signals enter the transmit/receive (T/R) 
common port 5 at the RF frequency. The signal level is boosted by 
the low noise amplifier (LNA) 7 with the addition of very little 
noise. The off-chip band pass filter 1 then rejects all of the noise 
power at the image frequency (local oscillator frequency (LO) - 
intermediate frequency (IF), for an RF signal at LO + IF). Without 
filter 1 the image noise power would be down-converted to the IF along 
with the signal (and noise) at the RF frequency. A mixer 9 
multiplies the RF and VCO signals and generates an IF signal at a 
frequency RF - LO (assuming RF is greater than LO). The IF signal is 
then amplified by a differential amplifier 11 prior to its output at 
port 13.  In the transmit mode a differential input signal at the IF 
frequency is input at port 15 and amplified by differential amplifier 
12. Mixer 9 multiplies the output of amplifier 12 with the VCO 
signal to generate two 'sidebands' at LO - IF and LO + IF. Assuming 
the RF signal is at LO + IF, then this is the wanted sideband and the 
LO - IF signal is termed the unwanted sideband. Filter 1 is used to 
reject the unwanted sideband and any other spurious mixing 
products/harmonics. The wanted RF signal is then routed back on chip 
and through a power amplifier 17 prior to output at the T/R common 
port 5. The transceiver circuit further comprises an amplifier 23 
connected to the output of VCO 3 for provding a phase locked loop 
(PLL) drive at output port 25 of the package. With reference to Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings, 
microwave integrated circuits (MICs) have a number of ground points 
all connected to a common ground plane. In the case of monolithic 
MICs (MMICs) this is normally the back side of the chip. When 
packaged it is normal to provide a low inductance ground (such as a 
metal based package) for the common chip ground. The inductance 
between the chip ground (internal to the package) and the circuit 
ground (external to the package) is termed the common lead ground 
inductance. A fraction of the output signal is fed directly back to the 
input. At low frequencies, where the reactance of
