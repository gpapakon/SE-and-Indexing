<ABSTRACT>
The present invention improves the comprehensibility of a 
document being read on a computer system. Rather than 

requiring a reader to stop and look up the meaning of a word, 
either on-line or with a printed copy, the present invention 

will automatically translate unknown words into words known to 
the reader. By checking each word in a document against a 

known word list maintained on the computer, the present 
invention improves the readers comprehension of a document as 

well as simplifies the reading thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to computer software, 
and in particular to a method and apparatus for facilitating 
comprehension of on-line documents. With the advent of computer on-line access to remote 
databases such as libraries, as well as the use of computers 
to review documents, it has frequently been necessary to 
resort to a dictionary and/or thesaurus to understand the 
material. Anytime it is necessary to refer to either an 
on-line reference or a printed reference to understand the 
meaning of words, the effort becomes tedious. Thus, if 
material being read is considerably above the reading level of 
the user, comprehension may suffer considerably. Thus, there 
is a need for a better mechanism to allow a reader to 
understand a document which demands above average and/or 
uncommon vocabulary without losing continuity. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for 
facilitating comprehension of an on-line document in a fashion 
which substantially reduces or eliminates the problems in the 
prior art. The present invention allows a computer system to 
automatically provide words that are known to the reader. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a 
method is provided for improving the comprehensibility of a 
document on a computer system. All words in the document are 
checked to identify a list of unknown words. The unknown 
words are determined by comparing all words to a list of known 
words maintained on the computer system. The unknown words 
are then supplemented with synonyms which are known to the  
 
reader. The document is displayed to the reader with the 
unknown words and the synonyms. It is a technical advantage of the present invention in 
that it is no longer necessary to utilize either a hard copy 
dictionary/thesaurus or an on-line dictionary/thesaurus to 
look up unknown words. The reader of a document is presented 
with a translation already done obviating the necessity to 
constantly revert back and forth from the document to a 
reference. For a more complete understanding of the present 
invention and the advantages thereof, reference is now made to 
the Detailed Description taken in conjunction with the 
attached Drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a data processing 
system in accordance with the present invention; Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating the broad concept of 
the present invention; and Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are flowcharts illustrating the 
present invention. Referring to Figure 1, there is

<CLAIMS>
A method of improving the comprehensibility of a document 
on a computer system for a reader thereof, comprising the 

steps of: 
   automatically identifying unknown words from all 

words in the document, said unknown words being 
unfamiliar to the reader; 

   automatically supplementing said unknown words with 
synonyms thereof which the reader is familiar with; and 

   automatically displaying the document with said 
synonyms adjacent said unknown words for the reader to 

review. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the step of identifying 
comprises: 

   automatically comparing said all words to a list of 
known words maintained on the computer system. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the step of supplementing 
comprises: 

   accessing a thesaurus maintained on the computer 
system to obtain said synonyms. 
The method of Claim 3, further comprising the step of: 
   automatically comparing said synonyms to a list of 

known words on the computer system, wherein said synonyms 
are displayed to the reader only if known thereto. 
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of: 
   automatically maintaining a list of known words for 

the reader on the computer system. 
The method of Claim 5, wherein the step of maintaining 
comprises the steps of: 

   establishing at least one parameter to define said 
known words; 

   tracking all words encountered against said 
parameter; and 

   maintaining a record of said tracking. 
The method of Claim 6, further comprising: 
   automatically comparing said record against said 

parameter, wherein said unknown words become known words 
when said at least one parameter is met. 
A computer system for improving the comprehensibility of 
a document on a computer for a reader thereof, 

comprising: 
   means for automatically identifying unknown words 

from all words in the document, said unknown words being 
unfamiliar to the reader; 

   means for automatically supplementing said unknown 
words with synonyms thereof which the reader is familiar 

with; and 
   means for automatically displaying the document with 

said synonyms adjacent said unknown words for the reader 

to review. 
The computer system of Claim 8, wherein said means for 
automatically identifying comprises: 

   means for automatically comparing said all words to 
a list of known words maintained on the computer. 
The computer system of Claim 8, wherein the step of 
supplementing comprises: 

   means for accessing a thesaurus maintained on the 
computer to obtain said synonyms. 
The computer system of Claim 10, further comprising: 
   means for automatically comparing said synonyms to a 

list of known words on the computer, wherein said 
synonyms are displayed to the reader only if known 

thereto. 
The computer system of Claim 8, further comprising: 
   means for automatically maintaining a list of known 

words for the reader on the computer. 
The computer system of Claim 12, wherein said means for 
maintaining comprises: 

   means for establishing at least one parameter to 
define said known words; 

   means for tracking all words encountered against 
said parameter; and 

   means for maintaining a record of said tracking. 
The computer system of Claim 13, further comprising: 
   means for automatically comparing said record 

against said parameter, wherein said unknown words become 
known words when said at least one parameter is met.
