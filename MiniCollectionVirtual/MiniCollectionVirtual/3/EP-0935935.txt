<ABSTRACT>
A deckchair (80) is designed to be retained in erected position by
means of selective engagement of its lower cross-bar (87) with one (88) of a

plurality of spaced-apart channels provided in a bracket (83) fixed to each of
the rear legs (84) of the deckchair. The plurality of spaced-apart channels

each have an entry portion (20 to 22) and a transversely directed engagement
portion (25' to 27') to ensure that the deckchair is unlikely to collapse

accidentally. The invention is applicable to different kinds of furniture
besides deckchairs, including sun loungers, folding tables and other folding

furniture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements relating to adjustable furniture
such as deckchairs for example.Deckchairs (1) of the kind shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying
drawings are well-known. The deckchair (1) of Figure 1 is adjustable by
selective engagement of its lower cross-bar support (2) with one of a series of
spaced-apart notches (3) formed in the upper edges of the rear legs (4).The deckchair (1) shown in Figure 1 is subject to the drawback that the
cross-bar support (2) is prone to pop out of the notches (3) whereupon the
deckchair is liable to collapse. This can happen if a person sitting in the
deckchair makes a sudden movement, for example, and can result in injury of
the user, especially if fingers are trapped as the deckchair collapses.The present invention aims to overcome or at least substantially reduce
the above-discussed drawback.In broad terms, the present invention resides in the concept of forming
the notches (3) such that the cross-bar support (2) cannot simply jump out, or
at least is unlikely to jump out, as the result of a simple stimulus, but rather
has to be disengaged by positive movement in at least two different directions. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an
article of furniture having a first structural portion which is designed to be
pivotally adjustable relative to a second structural portion and to be retained in
adjusted position by means of one or more struts pivotally attached at one end
to the first structural portion and having at its other end a locking member
engageable selectively with one of a plurality of spaced-apart channels
provided in or on the second structural portion of the article, said channels
each having an entry portion leading into an engagement portion transverse to
the entry portion, and both said entry portion and said engagement portion
being dimensioned for receiving said locking member with narrow spacing.The plurality of spaced-apart channels may be separated by one or
more upwardly-facing projections in a bracket structure which can be made of
cheap commonly-available material such as sheet metal or moulded plastics
material for example, the bracket structure being affixed to the said second
structural portion of the article. Alternatively, they can be formed integrally
with said second structural portion of the article.The engagement portion may advantageously comprise forward and
rearward sections on opposite sides of the entry portion so as to ensure that a
jolting movement of the locking member in

<CLAIMS>
An article of furniture having a first structural portion which is
designed to be pivotally adjustable relative to a second structural portion and

to be retained in adjusted position by means of one or more struts pivotally
attached at one end to the first structural portion and having at its other end a

locking member engageable selectively with one of a plurality of spaced-apart
channels provided in or on the second structural portion of the article, said

channels each having an entry portion leading into an engagement portion
transverse to the entry portion, and both said entry portion and said

engagement portion being dimensioned for receiving said locking member
with narrow spacing.
An article of furniture as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
engagement portion comprises spaced-apart forward and rearward sections

and the entry portion communicates with the engagement portion between
said forward and rearward sections.
An article of furniture as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
plurality of spaced-apart channels are separated from each other by one or

more upwardly-facing projections, and each of the one or more upwardly-facing
projections comprises a downwardly-directed hook formation

overhanging the or each end of the respective engagement portion, said hook
formations being generally complementarily shaped with respect to said

locking member.
An article of furniture as claimed in claim 3, wherein each of
the one or more upwardly-facing projections has an upper surface which is

inclined with respect to the engagement portions of the channels.
An article of furniture as claimed in claim 4, wherein said
upper surface is upwardly curved.
An article of furniture as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the plurality of spaced-apart channels are provided in a bracket

affixed to said second structural portion of the article.
An article of furniture as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
bracket is formed of metal.
An article of furniture as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
bracket is formed of plastics material.
An article of furniture as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the plurality of spaced-apart channels are integrally formed with said

second structural portion of the article.
An article of furniture as claimed in any preceding claim,
comprising a deckchair.
An article of furniture as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9,
comprising a sun lounger.
A bracket for attachment to an article of furniture as claimed in
any of the preceding claims, the bracket being formed so as to define said

channels.
A bracket substantially as herein described with reference to
any of Figures 2 to 6 of the accompanying drawings.
An article of furniture substantially as herein described with
reference to any of Figures 2 to 6 of the accompanying drawings.
An article of furniture as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11 and
14 except that the locations of the channels and the locking members that

engage therewith are interchanged.
