<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides communication apparatus for an audio 
conference which can operate in a limited bandwidth environment. The 

audio conferencing terminals are arranged to form part of a token ring. 
Audio data is passed cyclically between the terminals using an audio data 

packet in a conventional manner. Each audio communication terminal to 
transmits audio data to its logical successor only when it is in 

possession of the audio data packet. Each audio communication terminal 
upon receiving the audio data packet extracts therefrom and outputs to a 

user of the terminal the audio data contained therein. The audio 
communication terminal in possession of the audio data packet adds a 

respective block of digitised audio, comprising current digitised audio 
samples, to the audio data packet. The audio data packet is then passed 

to logical successor of the audio communication terminal. Consequently, 
the audio data packet upon at least one circulation around the token ring 

comprises audio data which represents the summation or superposition of 
all of the current digitised audio samples of the parties to the audio 

conference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to audio communication apparatus for 
audio communication over a data network, especially a data network having 
a limited bandwidth. Conventionally voice signals have been transmitted over standard 
telephone lines. However, with the increase in locations provided with 
local area networks (LANs) and the growing importance of multimedia 
communications, there has been considerable interest in the use of LANs 
to carry voice signals. This work is described for example in "Using 
Local Area Networks for Carrying Online Voice" by D Cohen, pages 13-21 
and "Voice Transmission over an Ethernet Backbone" by P Ravasio, R 
Marcogliese, and R Novarese, pages 39-65, both in "Local Computer 
Networks" (edited by P Ravasio, G Hopkins, and N Naffah; North Holland, 
1982). The basic principles of such a scheme are that a first terminal 
or workstation digitally samples a voice input signal at a regular rate 
(eg 8 kHz). A number of samples are then assembled into a data packet 
for transmission over the network to a second terminal, which then feeds 
the samples to a loudspeaker or equivalent device for playout, again at a 
constant 8 kHz rate. Conventional older audio communication systems comprise a central 
mixing hub and audio conferencing terminals connected thereto in a star 
network. The central hub receives audio signals from each terminal and 
produces a composite signal therefrom. The composite signal is then 
transmitted back to each terminal less that terminal's own audio signal. 
This is to be contrasted against LAN audio conferencing systems which 
have a more distributed architecture. Each terminal must receive in 
parallel via a data network the audio signal of all of the other 
terminals connected to the data network. Receiving the audio signals in 
parallel requires a large amount of bandwidth. The bandwidth requirement of an audio communication system using a 
scheme as described above varies according to the number of users of the 
system. For example, in an audio communication system which encodes 
audio as 8 bit pulse code modulation sampled at 8 kHz:
 
a two way audio conference requires a bandwidth of 2 x 64 kbps;
 
 
a five way audio conference using individual addressing requires a 
bandwidth of 20 x 64 Kbps; and
 
a five way audio conference using group addressing requires a bandwidth 
of 5 x 64 Kbps. Consequently, it can be seen that the greater the number of 
anticipated users, the greater the bandwidth required to implement the 
audio communication system.
