<ABSTRACT>
A method for making and collecting donations. A card is encoded with data identifying the card and a fund-raising entity. The card is presented by a donor desiring to make a donation to the fund-raising entity, and the encoded information on the card is entered into a computer which is preferably a computer-based cash register. A currency amount is also entered into the computer, and the computer associates this entered amount with the data identifying the card and the fund-raising entity. The entered currency is collected from the donor and distributed to the entered fund-raising entity by a variety of means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to charitable 
donations. More particularly, it relates to a novel system 
for making and collecting charitable donations. Fund-raising organizations typically solicit and 
collect charitable donations using conventional advertising 
and money-transfer techniques. For example, an 
organization may send a mass mailing or print a newspaper 
advertisement requesting donations. The donations, which 
are usually in the form of a check or money-order, are 
typically mailed to a post office box or address. The 
donations are then cashed or deposited through a financial 
institution. Another popular method of raising funds is to 
purchase television time and run advertisements or sponsored 
program. The viewers are asked to call in and make 
a donation. The donations are typically made by credit 
card over the phone, or by mailing a check or money order 
to a post office box or address. Although popular, these fund-raising methods are 
expensive and can require a great deal of labor and planning 
to implement. Also, the expense involved in such 
fund raising methods prohibits smaller fund-raising organizations 
from using them. Retail outlets and other businesses have allowed 
fund-raising organizations to place collection boxes or 
fund-collection lists in their stores in order to allow  
 
customers to make charitable donations. The effectiveness 
of such "box-and-list" methods has been limited, 
primarily because the collection process has not been 
sufficiently integrated with the normal financial transactions 
made by customers. Outside the charitable field, coded coupons are known for 
use in merchandising. One example of a coupon which has a monetary 
value when exchanged for specific goods is described in GB-A-1,597,201. The following terms may be used throughout this 
disclosure and are to be given their intended meaning as 
understood in the art, including but not necessarily limited 
to the following general definitions. The terms "article" or "item" refer to a product 
or other merchandise that can be marked with a bar code 
and identified by a computer-based cash register machine. The terms "bar code" or "bar code symbol" refer 
to a representation of an article number in a form suitable 
for scanning and/or reading by computer-based 
machines. The term "encode" refers to placing data and/or 
information into the form of a code. The term "EAN" stands for International Article 
Number (previously referred to as European Article Number) 
which is the uniform standard

<CLAIMS>
A method of collecting donations, the steps 
comprising: 


providing a donor with encoded data (48) 
identifying at least one entity; 
providing a computer (16) having data entry means 
(14), said computer (16) being programmed to perform 

the following functions: 
accept at said data entry means (14) said encoded 
data (48) identifying said at least one entity; 
accept at said data entry means (14) a currency 
amount of a charitable donation from said donor to 

said at least one entity; and 
associate said currency amount with said encoded 
data (48) identifying said at least one entity. 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said 
encoded data (48) further identifies at least one 

currency amount of a donation from said donor to said 
at least one entity. 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said data 
entry means (14) comprises a code reader and a 

keyboard. 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said data 
entry means (14) comprises a code reader capable of 

interpreting said encoded data (48) by one of optical, 
mechanical or magnetic means. 
The method defined in claim 1 further comprising 
the step of entering into said data entry means (14) 

said encoded data (48) identifying said at least one 
entity.  

 
The method defined in claim 5 further comprising 
the step of entering into said data entry means (48) a 

currency amount of a donation from said donor to said 
at least one entity. 
The method defined in claim 6 further comprising 
the step of collecting said currency amount from said 

donor. 
The method defined in claim 7 further comprising 
the step of transferring said currency amount to said 

at least one entity. 
The method defined in claim 8 wherein: 

said computer (16) has means (18,20,22) for 
initiating electronic currency transactions at a 

financial institution (26) via an on-line connection 
(24) to an electronic transaction system of said 

financial institution (26); and 
said currency amount is transferred to said at 
least one entity via said electronic transaction 

system. 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said 
encoded data identifying said at least one entity is 

encoded on a card (12a). 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said 
encoded data (48) is carried on a card (12a) and/or 

comprises one of a list including punch codes, bar 
codes, a magnetically encoded strip or a microcircuit 

chip. 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said 
encoded data (48) comprises bar codes and said bar  

 
codes comprise either EAN code or UPC code. 
The method defined in claim 1 wherein said 
computer (16) comprises a computer-based cash 

register. 
The method defined in claim 13 wherein said 
computer based cash register stores said encoded data 

(48) into a mass-storage means (22). 
The method defined in claim 1 further comprising 
the step of distributing an article having said 

encoded data (48) to potential donors. 
The method defined in claim 15 wherein said 
encoded data (48) further identifies to said computer 

(16) a means by which said article was distributed. 
A donation collecting means, comprising a printed 
card (12a) of plastic material, paper board, carton or 

similar printable sheet material, said card (12a) 
being provided with printed information (46) 

concerning at least the purpose of the donation and 
the entity receiving the donation; and said card (12a) 

being further provided with coded information (48), 
for example in the form of a bar code, automatically 

readable and processable by code-detecting means and a 
computer-based cash register of the type used in 

retail stores and similar business establishments.
