<ABSTRACT>
The high-pressure metal halide discharge lamp has tungsten electrodes (2) 
in a light-transmitting lamp vessel (1) which is closed in a vacuumtight manner. The 

electrodes (2) comprise an emitter which is distributed throughout their mass and is 
formed by a first oxide chosen from hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide and by a 

second oxide chosen from yttrium oxide, lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide and scandium 
oxide, and are substantially free from thorium oxide. The lamp retains its initial light 

output to a high degree throughout its life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high-pressure metal halide discharge lamp 
provided with a light-transmitting lamp vessel which is sealed in a vacuumtight manner 
and contains an ionizable filling with rare gas and metal halide, and in which tungsten 
discharge electrodes are arranged connected to current conductors which issue to the exterior 
through the lamp vessel, which electrodes are provided with an electron emitter, 
the electron emitter being constituted by an oxidic electron emitter. Such a high-pressure metal halide discharge lamp is known from US 
4,574,219. Near their free ends, the electrodes of the known lamp are provided with, 
for example coated with, a cermet of tungsten and metal oxide chosen from the oxides 
of scandium, aluminium, dysprosium, thorium, yttrium, and zirconium and mixtures 
thereof. The cermet in this case comprises 2 to 30% by weight metal oxide. It is the object of these electrodes to render it possible that the lamp 
quickly enters its operational state after starting and that a preceding period of a glow 
discharge is avoided. For this purpose, the cermet is porous so that the electrodes have 
a low thermal conductivity and consequently quickly assume their operational 
temperature. The complicated structure of the electrodes and the resulting complicated 
manufacture of the electrodes constitute a disadvantage. Another disadvantage of the 
known lamp is the use of the radioactive thorium oxide. This represents a severe strain 
on the environment, both during its manufacture and during manufacture of the 
electrodes, and also at the end of lamp life. Another disadvantage is that the emitter is 
comparatively quickly exhausted when oxides other than thorium oxide are used. Emitter is usually present in or on electrodes in discharge lamps for 
facilitating the emission of electrons. In proportion as the emitter has a lower work 
function compared with the electrode material without emitter the electrode will assume 
a lower temperature during operation. The evaporation of electrode material and 
deposition of the vapour on the lamp vessel are smaller then. A result of this is that the  
 
lamp has a higher luminous maintenance: its initial luminous efficacy (lm/W) is better 
maintained during lamp life. It is in particular the noxious thorium oxide which has a 
low work function. EP 0,136,726-A2 discloses a high-pressure sodium discharge lamp in 
which similar oxidic materials are used as emitters. In or on the electrodes there are 
present one or several of the oxides of
