<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moulded, activated fixed-bed Raney metal catalyst. The catalyst is obtained by moulding a powder of at least one catalyst alloy with a power of the pure catalyst metals with the addition of moulding aids and pore-forming materials and subsequent calcination at temperatures below 850 DEG C. During the calcination, the moulding aids and pore-forming materials burn. Alloy powder and metal powder sinter together in the course of this to give a mechanically stable and porous moulding. This moulding thus comprises the particles of the catalyst alloys which are bound by powder of the pure catalyst metals. It does not contain any catalytically inactive ceramic or vitreous binders. By leaching out the aluminium contained in the catalyst alloys using sodium hydroxide solution, the moulding is activated in a surface shell.
