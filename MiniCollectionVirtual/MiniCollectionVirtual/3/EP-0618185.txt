<ABSTRACT>
Corrosion metal contaminants are removed from a liquid 
composition comprising a carboxylic acid and/or an anhydride 

thereof, a rhodium carbonylation catalyst, and a carbonylation 
catalyst co-promoter by using a chelating resin selective for the 

removal of corrosion metals rather than carbonylation catalyst and 
co-promoter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the removal of corrosion
metal contaminants from liquid compositions comprising carboxylic
acids and/or anhydrides thereof and in particular to a process for
the removal of corrosion metal contaminants from a liquid
composition comprising a carboxylic acid and/or an anhydride
thereof, a rhodium carbonylation catalyst, a carbonylation catalyst
co-promoter and corrosion metal contaminants.Processes for the production of carboxylic acids and anhydrides
such as acetic acid and acetic anhydride by carbonylation are well
known and are operated industrially.Thus, UK patent GB 1,233,121 describes a process for the
production of an organic acid or its corresponding ester by
carbonylation using a rhodium catalyst. US patent US 4374070
describes preparation of acetic anhydride by carbonylation of methyl
acetate in the presence of rhodium, an iodine compound and lithium.
EP-A-087870 describes a process for the production of acetic
anhydride with or without the net co-production of acetic acid.In operating carbonylation processes over extended periods of
time, corrosion metal contaminants such as compounds of iron,
nickel, molybdenum, chromium and the like form and build up in the
carbonylation reaction composition. Such corrosion metal
contaminants, if present in sufficient amounts may have an adverse
effect on the carbonylation reaction.US patent number US 4628041 describes a process for recovery of
rhodium and iodine values in the manufacture of acetic acid by 
carbonylation by precipitating the rhodium to separate it from
corrosion metal salts.US patent number US 4007130 describes a process for
regenerating a spent carbonylation catalyst solution comprising a
rhodium or iridium catalyst by contacting it with a cation exchange
resin in its hydrogen form.European patent application publication number EP-A-0384652
describes the behaviour of the Group IV B metals in increasing
acetic acid productivity in liquid phase carbonylation in the
presence of a rhodium catalyst and an iodide promoter.
EP-A-0384652 proposes a process for treating process streams,
arising in the manufacture of acetic acid from methanol, which
process streams contain rhodium and typical corrosion metal salts
characterised in that the process comprises selectively removing all
the corrosion metals from the process stream with the exception of
chromium, molybdenum or tungsten salts. According to EP-A-0384652
selective removal of, for example, iron from a process stream
containing rhodium, iron, chromium,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the removal of corrosion metal contaminants from
a liquid composition comprising a carboxylic acid and/or an

anhydride thereof, a rhodium carbonylation catalyst, a carbonylation
catalyst co-promoter and corrosion metal contaminants, which process

comprises contacting the liquid composition with a chelating resin
selective for the retention of corrosion metals and recovering a

liquid composition having a reduced corrosion metal contaminant
concentration.
A process as claimed in claim 1 in which the chelating resin is
selected from the group of chelating resins having:


(a) iminodiacetate functional groups;
(b) aminophosphonic acid functional groups;
(c) functional groups represented by the general formula:


wherein (P) represents a polymer backbone;
(d) functional groups represented by the general formula: 


where (P) represents a polymer backbone;
and (e) functional groups represented by the general formula:

A process as claimed in claim 2 in which the iminodiacetate
functional groups are represented by the general formula:



where (P) represents a polymer backbone.
A process as claimed in claim 2 in which the aminophosphonic
acid functional groups are represented by the general formula: 



where (P) represents a polymer backbone.
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in
which the chelating resin is in the proton form.
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in
which the liquid composition comprises acetic acid and/or acetic

anhydride.
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in
which the corrosion metal contaminants comprise iron, nickel,

chromium, manganese and/or molybdenum.
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in
which th
e carbonylation catalyst co-promoter comprises an iodide of
a quaternary amine, phosphine, arsenic or antimony compound or is an

iodide salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal.
A process as claimed in claim 8 in which the carbonylation
catalyst co-promoter is lithium iodide.
A process for the production of carboxylic acids and/or
anhydrides thereof by the liquid-phase carbonylation reaction of

alcohols, ethers, esters and/or halides in the presence of a rhodium
carbonylation catalyst, a halogen-containing carbonylation promoter

and a carbonylation catalyst co-promoter in which a liquid
composition derived from the carbonylation reaction and comprising

carboxylic acid and/or an anhydride thereof, rhodium carbonylation
catalyst, carbonylation catalyst co-promoter and corrosion metal

contaminants is contacted, in a process as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 9, with a chelating resin selective for the retention

of corrosion metals and a liquid composition having a reduced
corrosion metal contaminant concentration is recovered therefrom

and recycled to the carbonylation reaction.
