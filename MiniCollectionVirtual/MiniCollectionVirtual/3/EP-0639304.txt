<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an inverse speed motor, especially a universal motor, with a braking device and a stator having a field winding and a rotating armature powered via a commutator and brushes and a suitable circuit for switching the field winding to braking mode and a braking device inducing an additional magnetic field during braking. The inverse speed motor is to be constructed in such a way that, when it is switched from motor to generator or braking mode, the braking process is simply triggered via self-excitation. To this end, to the set of pole shoes (12) of the stator are allocated means for inducing a magnetic field, preferably at least one additional coil (20), and at least one pole arc (16) of at least one pole shoe  has a groove (18) or a pair thereof and the additional coil (20) is arranged in the groove (18) or pair or grooves.

Series-wound motor, in particular a universal 
motor (10), having a stator, which has a field winding 

(26), and having a rotating armature (58), fed via a 
commutator and brushes (30), as well as having a switching 

arrangement, suitable for switching over into braking 
operation, in which in addition to the field coils (26) 

the pole shoe laminate stack (12) of the stator is 
assigned at least one additional coil (20), at least one 

pole arc (16) of at least one pole shoe having a groove 
(18) or a pair of grooves which are situated inside the 

pole arc (16) embraced by the field coil (26), and the 
additional coil (20) being arranged in the groove (18) or 

the pair of grooves, characterized in that the groove 
(18) or the pair of grooves is/are displaced relative to 

the neutral zone (24) of the armature in the sense (22) 
of rotation of the armature, and in that the winding of 

the additional coil (20) is designed in such a manner 
that there is no magnetic flux in the lateral yoke part 

during the braking operation.

in that the additional coils (20) are assigned to 

the field coils (26) such that they can be switched in 
alternately.
