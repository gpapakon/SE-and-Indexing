<ABSTRACT>
A clinical method for the detection of Alzheimer's disease in living patients tests cerebrospinal fluid obtained from the patient. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested using a Western blot analysis to determine reactivity with a polyclonal or a monoclonal antibody. The antibody is one which reacts with a broad band of immunoreactivity obtained upon separation of Alzheimer's specific, material derived from filaments obtained from brains of deceased individuals having Alzheimer's disease. The test is particularly selective and enables one to identify patients with Alzheimer's disease and distinguishes these from patient's with other neurological disorders with similar symptoms such as Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
CLINICAL TEST FOR DETECTION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Government RightsResearch leading to the discovery of the current invention was funded in part by a government grant from the National Institutes of Health grant number NIMH-MH43520. The United States Government may have certain rights in this invention. Background Alzheimer's disease is a 100% fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a chronically deteriorating course of cognitive, and later vegetative function. The definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made by pathologic examination of postmortem brain tissue in conjunction with a clinical history of dementia. The diagnosis of definite Alzheimer's disease cannot be made in living patients as it requires examination of brain which cannot be performed in living individuals for ethical reasons. The diagnosisof definite Alzheimer's disease is based on the presence in brain tissue of extensive infestation by neuritic (senile) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) whose density in brain are correlated with the severity of the clinical 

symptoms of the disease. The purpose of the present invention is to provide a laboratory based diagnostic test to allow the definite diagnosis ofAlzheimer's disease in living patients by utilizing patient samples moreaccessible than brain. Paired helical filaments are the only known pathological protein common to the two major neuropathological features which defineAlzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The biochemical characterization of paired helical filaments has been impeded because of technical difficulties in purifying and solubilizing this protein, a problem only recently solved. (Journal of Neurochemistry, Vol. 54, 148-155,1990).Postmortem detection of paired helical filaments (PHF) has been previously reported (Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 263, 2907-2910, 1990). This ELISA based test employing the antibody Alz50 may be used for the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.However, this test appears of no value for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in living patients as it exclusively utilizes postmortem Alzheimer's brain samples.Paired helical filaments purified and solubilized from Alzheimer's brain have been further characterized utilizing poiyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) which separates the PHF into: 1) a broad band of immunoreactivity ranging in molecular weight from approximately 20 to approximately 300 kilodaltons and 2) a specific 66 kilodalton protein referred to as PHF AD66
