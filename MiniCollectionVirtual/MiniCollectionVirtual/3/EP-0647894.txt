<ABSTRACT>
The first electrodes (d1 and d2) of first and second transistors (Q1 and Q2) of 
the same polarity are coupled to one (1) of first and second voltage supply lines 

(1 and 2). The second electrode (s1) of the first transistor (Q1) is coupled to the 
other (2) of the first and second voltage supply lines (1 and 2) by a reference 

current source (3) for supplying a reference current (I
r
) through the first transistor 
(Q1) and the second electrode (s2) of the second transistor (Q2) is arranged to 

be coupled to the other (2) of the first and second voltage supply lines (1 and 
2) by a load (RL) such that in operation of the circuit majority charge carriers 

flow through the first and second transistors (Q1 and Q2) in a direction away 
from the other (2) of the first and second voltage supply lines (1 and 2). The 

second transistor (Q2) has dimensions which are in a predetermined ratio with 
corresponding dimensions of the first transistor (Q1). An amplifying arrangement 

(4) has a negative input (4b) coupled to the second main electrode (s1) of the 
first transistor (Q1), a positive input (4a) coupled to the second main electrode 

(s2) of the second transistor (Q2) and an output (4c) coupled to the control 
electrodes (g1 and g2) of the first and second transistors (Q1 and Q2) for 

providing a negative feedback for causing, in use of the circuit, voltages at the 
positive and negative inputs (4a and 4b) of the amplifying arrangement (4) to be 

equal thereby causing the second transistor (Q2) to supply to the load (RL) 
coupled between the second main electrode (s2) of the second transistor (Q2) 

and the other voltage supply line (2) a current (I
o
) related to the reference 
current (I
r
) in accordance with the predetermined ratio. This circuit enables a 
constant output current (I
o
) to be provided with a very high output impedance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for providing a sink for majority charge 
carriers, that is a source where the majority charge carriers are electrons and 
a current sink where the majority charge carriers are holes. In the area of integrated circuit technology constant (that is high output 
impedance) current sources and sinks are important circuit elements. Generally 
current sinks can be realised relatively easily using an n type device such as a 
single n channel enhancement mode MOS transistor or cascoded n channel 
MOS transistors, while current sources can similarly be realised using p type 
devices such as p channel enhancement mode MOS transistors. However, 
there are some forms of integrated circuits where it is technologically difficult to 
provide both n channel and p channel enhancement mode MOS transistors so 
making it difficult to form current sources where only n channel devices are 
available and making it difficult to form current sinks where only p channel 
devices are available. This is the case, for example, in circuits formed by 
deposition of amorphous or polycrystalline semiconductor materials onto 
insulating substrates such as glass or plastics because the p channel 
enhancement mode thin film transistors (TFTs) that can currently be 
manufactured have unacceptably high threshold voltages in addition to very poor 
carrier mobility characteristics. Similarly in the area of smart power or power 
integrated circuit technology where a vertical power device is integrated with 
control or logic circuitry, the constraints of having to integrate the control or logic 
circuitry into the same substrate or semiconductor body as the power 
semiconductor device may make it extremely difficult to form usable p type 
devices, for example p channel enhancement mode MOS transistors, where the 
vertical power device is an npn bipolar transistor or n channel power MOSFET 
or to form usable n type devices, for example n channel enhancement mode  
 
MOS transistors, where the power device is a pnp bipolar transistor or a p 
channel vertical power MOSFET, without resorting to complicated processing 
technology. Currently n channel TFT digital circuits requiring a current source or load 
transistor for, for example, use in a logic gate or shift register generally use a 
circuit of the form shown in Figure 1. As can be seen from Figure 1, the circuit 
comprises an n channel TFT N1 having its drain electrode coupled to a first 
voltage supply line 1, its gate electrode coupled to a gate voltage
