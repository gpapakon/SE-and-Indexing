<ABSTRACT>
To improve the transmission quality of speech over existing narrow-band communications networks, it is known to measure the frequency-dependent attenuation and to compensate it. Furthermore it is known to amplify low-frequency components of the transmitted speech signal and to raise the pitch of the entire transmitted speech signal. The new process makes it possible also to supplement non-transmitted signal components in the speech signal. Use is here made of the fact that human speech is composed of a limited number of phonemes which can be recognised by a control unit. Depending on the narrow-band phoneme recognised, the broad band phoneme is subsequently read from a memory and the spectral components in the speech signal are supplemented which were previously filtered out by the bandwidth of the transmission path. Furthermore, an adaptation of the amplitude of the supplemented spectral components is further carried out. The process according to the invention and the circuit for carrying out the process can be used wherever a high reduction of the transmission bandwidth is carried out, that is to say in particular in subscriber equipment of a communications network.

Method for increasing the bandwidth of narrow-band
speech signals, in which:


a short-term spectral analysis is made of a speech
signal,
the calculated spectrum is compared with stored
spectra, and
the calculated spectrum is supplemented with spectral
components not contained therein,

characterized in that the calculated and the stored spectra
are coded in a linear predictive manner, in that the stored

LPC spectra are broad-band and are immediately used to
determine the spectral components to be supplemented, and

in that the amplitude of the LPC spectrum read out of the
memory (SP) is adjusted so that the matching of the LPC

spectra in the transmission frequency band of the
transmitted narrow-band LPC spectrum is at a maximum.
Method for increasing the bandwidth of narrow-band
speech signals, in which


a short-term spectral analysis is made of a speech

the calculated narrow-band spectrum is compared with
stored narrow-band spectra,
there is assigned to every stored narrow-band spectrum
a broad-band spectrum which has the necessary

bandwidth during reproduction, and
the calculated narrow-band spectrum is supplemented
with spectral components, not contained therein, of a

stored broad-band spectrum assigned to the narrow-band

in the transmission frequency band of the transmitted

narrow-band LPC spectrum is at a maximum.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that there is stored in a memory (SP) for every LPC

spectrum a correction factor for the multiplier (MUL) by
which a less complex amplitude matching of the supplemented

spectral components is achieved on the basis of an LPC
prediction error signal or an excitation signal (AR).
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the amplitude of the LPC spectrum

read out of a memory (SP) is adjusted so that the matching

transmitted narrow-band LPC spectrum is at a maximum.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the log spectral deviation factor or

the Itakura Saito differential factor of the spectra to be
compared is used to assess the matching of the spectra.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that band-limited speech samples are used

to generate a code book having narrow-band envelopes and in
that the respective associated broad-band versions of the

same speech samples are used to generate an assigned code
book having broad-band envelopes.

of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a transmission

signal is fed to a frequency regeneration circuit (FR), in
that the frequency regeneration circuit (FR) is connected

to a multiplier (MUL), in that the multiplier is connected
to a control unit (DSP), in that the multiplier is

connected to a first LPC synthesis filter (LPCS1) and in
that the control unit is connected to a memory (SP).

second LPC synthesis filter (LPCS2) is connected to an

oversampler (AT), in that the oversampler (AT) is connected
to a first output filter (AF1), in that the bandwidth-increasing

circuit (BBV) is connected to an output filter
(AF2) complementary to the first output filter (AF1) and in

that the output filters (AF1, AF2) are connected to the
inputs of an adder (AD).
