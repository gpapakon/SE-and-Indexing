<ABSTRACT>
An improved core-form transformer (20) is disclosed. The core-form transformer (20) includes a c-wrapped ribbon conductor (32) with opposing wide sides and opposing thin sides. The c-wrapped ribbon conductor (32) is wound around a core (24) to form a plurality of coil sections (22). Adhesive is applied directly to one of the wide sides of the ribbon conductor (32) to form a strong mechanical coupling within the coil sections (22). A novel transposing fold (50, 52, 30, 44) of the ribbon conductor (32) is employed to create coil transpositions. The core-form transformer (20) of the invention reduces circulating current losses while utilizing only a small number of transposing folds, generally adjacent to a first coil section, a last coil section, and an intermediate coil section.

 IMPROVED CORE-FORM TRANSFORMERBrief Description of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to core-form power transformers. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved core-form power transformer which employs a c-wrapped ribbon conductor with a novel transposing fold and transposition scheme.Background of the InventionModern transformer windings are fabricated using a wide variety of methods. In high power applications, a rectangular shaped ribbon conductor may be wound about a core to form a coil. Adjacent coil sections may be coupled by complicated transposition folds of the ribbon conductor.A typical ribbon conductor comprises parallel strands of insulated wire resulting in a wide, thin cable. The strands themselves may be rectangular for increased strength, and to provide a more compact transformer. For instance, the ribbon conductor may comprise five strands or ribbon conductor elements. The strands may be approximately .045 inches by .250 inches, with a typical range of .030 to .096 inches by .200 to .580 inches. The strands are coated with enamel. The ribbon conductor is then wrapped in an insulating paper.When ribbon conductors are used in core-form transformers, the thinness of the conductors allows more turns to be wound into a coil section, resulting in a winding that has a fraction of the sections of a conventional coil. The greater width of the ribbon 

conductor allows a high series capacitance in the coil. This provides an improved voltage distribution across the coil sections and permits reduced section and turn insulation. The reduced insulation and the fewer coil sections result in a greatly improved space factor for the coil and hence a smaller core with lower winding weights and lower no load and load losses.While ribbon conductors may be successfully employed to manufacture core-form transformers, there are still a number of shortcomings associated with existing devices . One shortcoming is that they are susceptible to mechanical weakness. In addition, it would be highly advantageous to further reduce the size of core-form transformers without reducing their capacity. When core-form transformers are manufactured from ribbon conductors, a number of inefficiencies are associated with the manufacturing process. First, the insulating paper wrapped around the conductor typically forms a bulging and wasteful overlapping paper region on one side of the conductor. In addition, the creation of transpositions between coil sections typically entails a
