<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a carpet 
construction in which the primary components -- tufts, 

backing(s) and adhesive -- are all formed from a 
polyamide. Carpet samples such as used carpet or 

carpet scraps having this construction are easily 
recyclable into a polyamide blend which can function as 

a substitute for virgin polyamides in a variety of 
applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a carpet 
construction. More specifically, the present invention 
is directed to a carpet construction wherein each 
primary component (backing[s], tufts and adhesive) is 
formed of a polyamide. Use of all polyamide materials 
results in a carpet construction which is more easily 
recyclable into a polyamide blend. For many years, disposal of waste materials 
has been conducted in ways detrimental to the 
environment. It has been burned in massive 
incinerators thereby polluting the air. It has been 
dumped in the ocean thereby contaminating the water 
supply. It has been buried in landfills where it 
collects without decomposing for years. In recent times, individuals and corporations 
alike have expended significant effort on identifying 
environmentally responsible methods for disposing of 
waste products from synthetic materials such as man-made 
polymeric materials. One important direction 
taken along this line is the development of programs 
for collecting the synthetic waste materials for 
recycling and re-use in other products or applications. The flooring industry, including commercial 
and residential carpet and tile manufacturers, has 
actively participated in investigating the 
applicability of recycling for their products; however, 
some of these products present particularly difficult 
challenges to recycling efforts since they are 
typically manufactured from components formed from 
different synthetic materials which have different 
physical and chemical characteristics. For example, 
conventional nylon carpeting typically includes a 
plurality of tufts formed from nylon fibers, at least  
 
one backing formed from a polyolefin such as 
polypropylene and a calcium carbonate-filled adhesive 
material of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) originally 
applied as a latex. The success of attempts to recycle such 
multi-component products has been severely limited. 
For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,158,646 and 5,145,617 
disclose methods for reprocessing fiber-containing 
waste materials wherein the process results in a fiber-containing 
final product. These types of processes are 
restricted in utility to the limited application where 
composite (fiber/matrix) materials are useful. Other processes focus on separating out the 
individual components. Specifically, efforts in 
reclaiming or recycling carpet materials, such as those 
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,028,159, and 5,169,870, 
involve separating the individual materials through 
various processing
