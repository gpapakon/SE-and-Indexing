<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a device for protecting 
anode hanger nipples when manufacturing aluminium in a 

Hall-Heroult electrolysis process, made of a composite 
material consisting of carbon residues, hardening 

material, water and a catalyst. The device is 
characterised by two or more prefabricated, 

dimensionally stable parts which are designed to be 
joined in an arrangement in situ.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for the protection of the 
lower part of an anode hanger (hereinafter called a nipple) 
during the production of aluminium in a Hall-Heroult electrolysis 
process, made of a composite material consisting of carbon 
residues, hardening material, water and a catalyst. The anode hanger functions like an electric current conductor and 
fastening device for the anode in an electrolysis cell. The lower 
part of the anode hanger consists of two or more steel bolts 
which are fixed in the anode by casting. Aluminium is generally manufactured from aluminium oxide 
dissolved in a bath consisting mainly of melted cryolite. The 
bath is typically kept at a temperature of 940 - 980Â°C. The 
cathode represents the bottom of an electrolysis cell formed like 
a vessel containing the bath, while the anodes are submerged into 
the bath from above. The current is passed through an 
electrolysis cell from the anode hanger and through the anode and 
the bath/metal layer to the cathode. The anode is oxidised from 
its base surface upwards by the oxygen which is formed in the 
decomposition phase of the aluminium oxide. In order to be able 
to utilise the anode to the maximum, the nipples to which the 
anode is fastened must be protected against the liquid bath which 
is forced in towards the nipples when the anode approaches 
critical consumption level. Without a protective device the bath would attack the nipples 
with erosion of the iron as a result, which is very damaging for 
the quality of the metal.
 
The normal method of protecting the nipples today is to make a 
formwork of aluminium tape or cardboard around the nipple so that 
an annulus is formed between the formwork and the nipple which is 
filled with a granulate consisting of carbon, preferably coke, 
and a binding material consisting of pitch.  This composite is heated up by the temperature transition from 
the anode and is melted and calcinated to form a solid, 
dimensionally stable protective device. The disadvantage of this 
procedure is that during this process the composite gives off PAH 
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) gases which are registered 
today as possible carcinogens. Furthermore, it is an expensive 
procedure as high quality raw materials are used. The aim of the present invention was to improve commonly known 
solutions for protecting nipples beyond the known technology. A 
further aim was to produce a device which is reasonable to 
produce in terms of cost, is simple to join around the nipples 
after

<CLAIMS>
Device (5) for protecting anode hanger nipples (6) when 
manufacturing aluminium in a Hall-Heroult electrolysis process, 

made, for example, of a composite material consisting of carbon 
residues, hardening material, water and catalyst,characterised by two or more prefabricated, 

dimensionally stable parts which are designed to be joined in an 
arrangement (5) around each of the nipples. 
Device in accordance with claim 1,characterised in that the parts of the 
device can be locked together at the ends, which are designed in 

the form of a male/female connection (11). 
Device in accordance with claims 1 and 2,characterised in that the device (5) is 
designed in such a way that an annulus (9) is formed between the 

nipple (6) and the device (5), which can be filled with, for 
example, crushed bath and aluminium oxide so that the expansion 

of the nipples (6) in connection with a rise in temperature does 
not affect the device (5). 
Device in accordance with claim 3,characterised in that the upper part of the 
device is provided with a diagonal part (10) to make it easier to 

pour crushed bath and aluminium oxide into the annulus (9). 
Device in accordance with claims 3 and 4,characterised in that the size of the 
annulus (9) is sufficiently large for the crushed bath and 

aluminium oxide material to cover the whole of the surface of the 
nipple which is enclosed by the device (5). 
Device in accordance with claims 1-5,characterised in that the parts are jointed 
together by means of a binder. 
Device in accordance with claims 1-6,characterised in that the parts are fastened 
to the nipples and/or the anode by means of a binder.
