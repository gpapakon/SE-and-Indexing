<ABSTRACT>
A body care apparatus has a razor part (1) having a razor blade head (4) for shaving and a handle (2) designed as a hair-cutter. The razor part has a holding body (3) for carrying the razor blade head (4) in an exchangeable manner and which can be snapped on the hair-cutter (2) selectively in a use position for shaving, in which it projects at an angle, and in a non-use position. For fastening the razor part the hair-cutter has a traverse (7) upon which the razor part holding body (3) is snapped with a groove-shaped recess (8) in both said positions. When not in use, the holding body is snapped on in an upside down position, so that the razor blade head (4) is located in a recess (11) inside the hair-cutter. The apparatus is thus always ready to be used for cutting hair and for shaving.
