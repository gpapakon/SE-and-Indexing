<ABSTRACT>
Miscella is bleached using a bleaching agent which is in the 
form of granules having an average particle size of ≧ 0.5 mm. 

An advantage embodiment of the process uses the granules as 
the stationary phase of a packed column through which the 

miscella flows. The process lacks a special bleaching agent 
separation step. The granules can be easily regenerated and 

the recovered oil is recycled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for bleaching 
a miscella comprising an edible oil by contacting the miscella 
with a bleaching agent. A miscella is defined as being a mixture of a crude edible 
oil or oil mixture obtained by pressing and/or extracting oil 
containing products and an extracting agent. In caustic neutralization some of the impurities (free 
fatty acids, phospholipids, metals, part of peroxides) are 
removed by neutralization. However, an amount of oxidated 
triglycerides, soaps and particular colour imparting substances 
will still be present in the refined oil. Therefore frequently 
a subsequent bleaching step has to be performed. Bleaching is 
currently done by stirring of about 0.3 - 15% of activated 
bleaching earth during 15- 30 minutes, under vacuum at 
temperatures ranged between 90 - 120 °C. The bleaching earth 
is further removed by filtration. The solid effluent contains 
relatively large amounts of oil (about 25 - 50%). The present invention aims to provide a process in which 
a miscella of an edible oil can be bleached in a convenient 
way without high oil losses and without the involvement of high 
investments in equipment. To this end the present invention is characterised in 
that the bleaching agent used is bleaching earth in granular 
form with an average particle size of at least 0,5 mm. The miscella elution is greatly facilitated if granulated 
bleaching earth is used instead of fine powder bleaching earth. 
As a consequence, bleaching earth packed columns with much lower 
diameter/length ratios can he used. Furthermore the investment-costs 
for equipment are considerably reduced and the oil losses 
appear to be reduced when compared with prior art bleaching 
processes. The bleaching agent can be any granular bleaching earth 
(e.g. aluminium silicate - F-24 Engelhard, Tonsil COG, CO, 
Granosil) suitable as adsorbent in miscella bleaching. The 
granules are preferably used as a stationary phase in a packed  
 
column through which the miscella to be bleached is flown. By 
eluting the miscella through a stationary phase in a packed 
column the miscella can be bleached by the adsorbent without 
the necessity of complex process steps and complex separation 
equipment. The edible oil which is present in the miscella to be 
bleached is advantageously cottonseed oil. It appears that by bleaching this oil in the process 
of the present invention most of the colour bodies of cottonseed 
oil are removed. Furthermore, an effective removal of the 
peroxides takes place.
