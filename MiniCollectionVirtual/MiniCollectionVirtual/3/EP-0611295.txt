<ABSTRACT>
A cryogenic probe comprises a probe body (30) and a tip (10), the body and the tip having co-operating screw threads for releasably securing the tip to the body. The probe tip is largely formed of plastics material, whilst the head portion (14) of the tip as used for surgery is formed from brass. When a cryosurgical operation has been completed the tip (10) may be removed from the probe body and, due to the constructional materials used, the tip is rendered disposable. A new tip (10) can be used for any subsequent operation, thus obviating the risk of cross-contamination without the need for sterilisation procedures.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Iwprovewents in or Relating to Cryogenic ProbesThis invention relates to cryosurgical apparatus, and concerns in particular portable cryogenic probes such as are used by general practitioners and other doctors for out-patient treatment of skin lesions such as warts, moles and the like. Such devices may be contact probes, where a super-cooled tip is applied directly to the surgical site, or may be spray devices where a spray of cryogen is directed on to the relevant site. In this Specification, the term "probe" is to be understood as referring to both types of device.Known probes are attached to a cryogenic supply apparatus and comprise a probe body and tip which are made of brass. The disadvantage of such a probe is that brass is expensive and the tips have to be sterilised before each use.It is an objection of the invention to obviate and/or mitigate these and other disadvantages.According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a probe tip for a cryogenic probe, the tip being adapted to be removably secured to a probe body. 

 According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a cryogenic probe comprising a probe tip and a probe body, the tip being adapted to be removably secured to the probe body.Preferably, the probe tip comprises securing means to secure the probe tip to the probe body. The securing means may comprise cooperating formations provided on the tip and the body adapted to cooperate with each other. Preferably, the securing means comprise screw threads on the tip adapted to engage corresponding screw threads on the probe body. The threads on the probe tip may be internal and the threads on the body may be external.In the preferred embodiment, the probe tip compr¬ ises a main portion and a head portion, the head portion extending from the main portion. The main portion may be formed of a suitable plastics material, for example acetal, and the head portion may be formed of a suitable material for use in contacting the body tissue at super¬ cooled temperatures. The head portion may be formed of a metallic material, for example brass.The probe body may comprise an extending portion upon which the threads are formed. 

 Exhaust means may be provided to exhaust evapora¬ ted cryogen from the probe. Preferably, the exhaust means comprises an exhaust tube projecting from the probe body.An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings:-Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a probe tip;Fig. 2 is a view along the

Claims:-
1. A cryogenic probe comprising a probe tip and a probe body, the tip being adapted to be removably secured to the probe body.
2. A probe according to Claim 1 wherein the tip includes securing means comprising screw threads adapted to engage corresponding screw threads on the probe body.
3. A probe according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the probe tip comprises a main portion and a head por¬ tion, the head portion extending from the main portion.
4. A probe according to Claim 3 wherein the main portion is formed of a plastics material.
5. A probe according to Claim 4 wherein the main portion is formed of acetal and the head portion is formed of brass.
6. A probe according to any of the preceding Claims and further comprising exhaust means to exhaust evaporated cryogen from the probe.
7. A probe substantially as hereinbefore described 


with reference to the accompanying drawings.
8. Any novel subject matter or combination including novel subject matter disclosed, whether or not within the scope of or relating to the same invention as any of the preceding Claims.
