<ABSTRACT>
A method for the mutual displacement of at least two parts of an actuator 
interconnected by a bridge, and such an actuator. The bridge which connects the two 

parts and extends parallel to a main surface is locally heated through and through with a 
temperature gradient which is minimized transverse to the main surface, and is 

subsequently cooled down whereby the length of the bridge between the parts is reduced 
owing to the plastic deformat
ion which occurs, so that the parts are displaced relative to 
one another in a direction parallel to the main surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of mutually displacing at least two parts
of an actuator through local heating and cooling-down of the actuator, whereby the
actuator is plastically deformed locally and the parts are moved relative to one another.The invention also relates to an actuator suitable for use in such a method.In the case of a method and actuator as disclosed in European Patent
Application EP-A2 0488658, two interconnected plate-shaped parts are positioned in
relation to one another in that one of the plate-shaped parts is locally heated by a laser
and is then allowed to cool down, whereby the plate-shaped part is plastically deformed
locally. The laser is aimed transversely at a main surface of the plate-shaped part and
heats the plate-shaped part over part of its thickness. The plastic deformation bends the
plate-shaped part in a direction transverse to the main surface of the plate-shaped part.
Impacts or vibrations in the direction in which the plate-shaped part has been bent will
apply a bending or torsional load to the plate-shaped parts. The stiffness of the plate-shaped
parts against bending and torsion is comparatively low, so that the mutual
positioning accuracy in the direction in which the plate-shaped part has been bent is
comparatively low during an impact load or vibrations.The invention has for its object to provide a method whereby parts of an
actuator are displaced relative to one another in a certain direction, while the actuator
has a comparatively great stiffness and a comparatively high positioning accuracy in this
direction.The method according to the invention is for this purpose characterized in
that a bridge connecting the two parts and extending parallel to a main surface is locally
heated through and through with a temperature gradient which is minimized transversely
to the main surface, and is subsequently cooled down whereby the length of the bridge 
between the parts is reduced owing to the plastic deformation which takes place, so that
the parts interconnected by means of the bridge are displaced relative to one another in
a direction parallel to the main surface. Since the bridge is locally heated uniformly
through its entire thickness transversely to the main surface, the bridge is not bent in a
direction transverse to the main surface but is shortened in the longitudinal direction of
the bridge which is directed parallel to the main surface. The bridge is loaded with a
tension or compression force in the case of impacts or vibrations in the direction in
whic

<CLAIMS>
A method of mutually displacing at least two parts of an actuator through
local heating and cooling-down of the actuator, whereby the actuator is plastically

deformed locally and the parts are moved relative to one another, characterized in that a
bridge connecting the two parts and extending parallel to a main surface is locally

heated through and through with a temperature gradient which is minimized transversely
to the main surface, and is subsequently cooled down whereby the length of the bridge

between the parts is reduced owing to the plastic deformation which takes place, so that
the parts interconnected by means of the bridge are displaced relative to one another in

a direction parallel to the main surface.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that several bridges
interconnecting the parts with one another are heated and cooled down.
A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that at least two bridges
which are situated at a comparatively short distance from one another are alternately

shortened, the one bridge preventing an undesirable displacement of the parts relative to
one another while the other bridge is being locally heated through its full width and

thickness.
An actuator suitable for use in a method as claimed in any one of the
preceding Claims, provided with at least two parts which are displaceable relative to

one another by a plastic deformation of the actuator upon local heating and cooling-down
of the actuator, characterized in that the parts are interconnected by means of a

bridge and are displaceable relative to one another in a direction parallel to a main
surface, which bridge is directed parallel to the main surface and can be heated and

cooled down through its full thickness transversely to the main surface, whereby the
length of the bridge between the two parts can be reduced as a result of the plastic

deformation which takes place.
An actuator as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that several bridges
interconnect the parts.
An actuator as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the actuator 
comprises at least two substantially parallel bridges and a third bridge which is situated

diagonally between the parallel bridges, the third bridge being arranged between ends of
the parallel bridges and enclosing acute angles with the parallel bridges.
An actuator as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that each part is
connected to two guides by means of two hinges, the four hinges forming virtual

vertices of a parallelogram, whereby the parts are displaceable parallel to one another.
An actuator as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the second part is
enclosed by the first part in the main surface and is connected to the first part by means

of a number of bridges which are fastened to mutually opposed sides of the second part.
