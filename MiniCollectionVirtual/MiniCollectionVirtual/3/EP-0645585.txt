<ABSTRACT>
As a rule, water seals are installed in front of excess gas burners or in front of waste gas burners. They are intended to serve as flashback arresters but also as a pressure barrier. Previously known water seals fulfil this double function only partially or unsatisfactorily as, during operation, as a result of fluctuations of the state of the liquid level inside the water seal, there are gas pulses or liquid discharge from the water seal. According to the invention, the liquid is discharged upwards (15) from an inner annular space (4) by the gas flowing through. The discharged liquid is separated by an impact screen (12) with a deflecting collar (13), the liquid striking it being deflected downwards. A liquid film which is created in the process is divided into strands by deflecting sheets (14). In the intermediate spaces between the liquid strands, the gas can escape (17) unhindered upwards from the water seal without significant quantities of liquid being taken along. The liquid (16) running off from the deflecting sheets (14) is collected in an outer annular space (10). The liquid can flow back from the outer annular space (10) via at least one backfilling opening (5) into the inner annular space (4), a constant liquid circulation being achieved.

Method of operating a liquid seal upstream of 
flare systems or of waste-gas combustion systems, a gas 

stream (1) being introduced into the liquid seal via a 
submerged pipe (2) which is submerged in a liquid, in 

which method the gas stream (1) is deflected by the 
accumulated liquid (4), with a reversal of the flow 

direction of from 160 to 200°, preferably 180°, some of 
the liquid being carried along by the gas flow, and gas 

and liquid being vortexed (15), characterized 

a) in that the resulting gas/liquid flow (15) is guided 
against a baffle screen (12) with deflecting collar 

(13) and the flow direction is deflected thereon by 
from 140 to 200°, preferably 180°, 
b) in that the deflection of the flow direction forms 
a liquid film, 
c) in that the liquid film is split up into individual 
liquid streams by inserts (14), and 
d) in that the liquid streams flow off (16) into a 
collecting space (10 + 6) of the liquid seal, while 

the gas, with a renewed reversal of the flow 
direction, flows off (17) upwards through the 

interspaces between the liquid streams. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that circulation of the liquid is maintained within the 

liquid seal via the flow of the liquid which is carried 
along by the gas flow and via a return flow from the 

collecting space (10 + 6) into the accumulated liquid. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the liquid streams flow off into an outer 

annular space (10) of the liquid seal, the liquid  
 

flowing, from there, into a storage space (6) and from 
the storage space (6), via at least one refilling opening 

(5), into an inner annular space (4), where the gas flow 
is guided towards the liquid by way of the submerged pipe 

(2). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that deflecting plates (14) are used as 

liquid-stream-producing inserts. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the liquid streams are produced by a plurality of, 

preferably two, rows of deflecting plates (14). 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the liquid streams produced on a first to 

penultimate row of deflecting plates (14), as seen in the 
flow direction, are guided onto the following row of 

deflecting plates (14), as seen in the flow direction. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the gas stream (1) is directed 

towards the accumulated liquid via a submerged-pipe end 
(3) designed with a saw-tooth profile. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that a swirling flow is produced by the saw 

teeth of the submerged-pipe end (3) being arranged 
obliquely. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the gas/liquid flow (15) has a loading 

ratio, i.e. a ratio of liquid mass to gas mass, of from 
3 to 5. 
Liquid seal having a submerged pipe (2) which is 
arranged centrally and vertically in the liquid seal, 

characterized by an inner annular space (4) which is 
arranged around the bottom submerged-pipe end (3) and is

beyond the bottom submerged-pipe end (3), by a 

baffle screen (12) which is arranged at an angle from 70 
to 110°, preferably perpendicularly, with respect to the

is arranged, at the outer end of said baffle screen, at
