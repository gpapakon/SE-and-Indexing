<ABSTRACT>
An electric iron (10) includes a soleplate 
(18), a soleplate cover (30) connected to the 

soleplate, a housing (12) connected to the 
soleplate, and a water tank (20) associated with 

the housing. The soleplate and soleplate cover 
are spaced to form a surge chamber (42) 

therebetween. The soleplate cover (30) includes a 
first flow opening (40) communicating the water 

tank (20) with the surge chamber. A flow control 
member (50) controls the flow of water from the 

tank (20) to the surge chamber (42). A seal (60) 
overlies the first flow opening (40) and includes 

a first portion (64) in sealing engagement with 
the first flow opening (40). The portion of the 

seal includes a first leg (72) extending through 
the flow opening (40) below the lower surface of 

the cover. The leg (72) includes a nozzle (74) 
for directing water from the tank (20) into the 

surge chamber (42) in a tangential flow path 
relative to the lower surface of the cover (30). 

The nozzle (72) directs the water towards a 
temperature-sensing element (27,54,56) used to 

control the temperature of a soleplate heater 
(19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electric irons and 
in particular to a seal used to seal the surge 
chamber formed in the soleplate. The typical modern steam iron generally 
includes a "surge" function. The surge function 
increases the speed and effectiveness of the steam 
iron in removing wrinkles from certain fabrics by 
enabling the user of the iron to selectively 
generate relatively large quantities of steam at 
intermittent times in the ironing process. Typically, a surge chamber is formed in the 
soleplate between the top surface of the soleplate 
and the bottom surface of the soleplate cover. To generate the relatively large quantities 
of steam at intermittent times, the iron includes 
a separate surge control which allows the user to 
intermittently supply a relatively large quantity 
of water into the surge chamber from the water 
reservoir when the surge of steam is desired. It 
has been found that the temperature sensing 
element controlling the supply of electrical 
energy to the soleplate heater should be located  
 
in relatively close proximity to the portion of 
the surge chamber which directly receives the flow 
of water from the water reservoir. The relatively 
large flow of water from the water reservoir into 
the surge chamber immediately cools the portion of 
the soleplate onto which the water drops. 
However, if the temperature sensing element is 
remote from the soleplate surface cooled by the 
water entering into the surge chamber, the element 
will not sense the decrease in the soleplate 
temperature for some period of time. This results 
in the temperature of the soleplate being lowered 
below the desired working temperature. An electric iron comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-3 711 972. Due to design and space limitations, it is 
not always possible to place the temperature 
sensing element as desired in close proximity to 
the portion of the surge chamber receiving the 
water from the reservoir. Accordingly, it is an 
object of this invention to manufacture an 
electric iron having a surge function including a 
seal member about the surge opening formed in the 
soleplate cover; the member directs the water 
flowing into the surge chamber towards the 
temperature sensing element controlling the supply 
of electric power to the soleplate heater.  
 The foregoing object and other objects of the 
invention are attained in an electric iron having 
a soleplate, a soleplate cover attached to the 
soleplate, a housing connected to the soleplate 
and
