<ABSTRACT>
Azimuth and elevation information relating to ground based weapons equipment is inputted to a north finding system. The system determines angular azimuth and elevation errors and transmits signals to a display arrangement for indicating the direction to rotate the system so as to eliminate the errors. As the system is aimed, a gyro included in the north finding system measures angular rotation about its input axis and accelerometers measure the change in tilt. The computer projects the rotations to the horizontal plane and determines the change in azimuth. This is a continuous procedure until all errors are eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to aiming and
pointing systems for ground based weapons equipment
and, particularly, to a system of the type described
using a north finding system. More particularly,
this invention relates to a system which provides
operating personnel with the pointing angles of a
weapon relative to north and local horizontal and
relative to a target.Prior art systems for the purposes described
feature a gyrocompassing device using a conventional
spinning wheel two axis gyroscope (gyro) to find the
pointing angle of the weapon relative to north. The
angle is then transferred optically to a fixed
standard called an aiming circle. The device is
removed from the weapon before firing. All
corrections for angular errors caused by firing are
subsequently removed by optically re-aligning the
weapon to the aiming circle.Gyrocompassing devices are known which feature a
stabilized reference package. An arrangement of this
type includes a precision gyro that is maintained in
the horizontal position by isolating the gyro from
the weapon on a stabilized platform. This technology
is necessarily cumbersome and expensive because it
requires mechanism including at least three
gyroscopes, two level sensing devices and three
gimbals.Strapped down ring laser gyro packages are also
known. Again, this technology is more cumbersome and
more expensive than otherwise desired because it must
include three ring laser gyros and three 
accelerometers, as will be appreciated by those
skilled in the art.The aforementioned prior art arrangements
present several problems that need to be solved. For
example, the weapon must be leveled to within 0.25
degrees from the horizontal in order to gyrocompass.
Spinning wheel gyroscopes have degraded accuracies
when gyrocompassing at tilts due to mass unbalance
error terms and characteristics. Even when leveled,
such arrangements are only marginally accurate for
long range projectiles. Typical accuracy is five
mils (one sigma).Further, spinning wheel systems cannot be
permanently affixed to the weapon during
transportation or firing because the vibration and
shock which ensues reduces system reliability.
Consequently, these systems only obtain the initial
pointing angle of the weapon and are not usable to
provide continuous pointing data while the weapon is
being aimed or after firing. Also, mounting and
dismounting these systems is, at best, inefficient
and even dangerous during weapon firing conditions.Also, relying on the aforementioned optical
transferring of the pointing
