<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method 
and apparatus for calibrating a bi-metal gauge. A known bi-metal gauge includes a bi-metal 
element fixed to a support member and having a 
cantilevered portion over which an electrical coil is 
wound. When current is passed through the coil, the 
cantilevered portion is heated and deflects from its 
rest position due to the imbalance in the composition 
thereof. The free end of the cantilevered portion 
co-operates with a pointer carrier such that 
deflection of the cantilevered portion causes rotation 
of a pointer carried by the pointer carrier. On assembly of the gauge, the position of 
the bi-metal element must be adjusted relative to the 
pointer carrier to ensure (a) that deflection of the 
bi-metal element will cause rotation of the pointer 
through the whole of its intended range and (b) that 
deflection of the bi-metal element causes the correct 
amount of rotation of the pointer. A known method of calibrating such a gauge 
involves two manual calibration steps, the first of 
which involves rotating the bi-metal element relative 
to the pointer carrier so as to adjust rest position 
of the pointer and thereby the amount of rotation of 
the pointer for any predetermined gauge reading. The 
second stage involves moving the support member in a 
direction towards or away from the pointer carrier so 
as to adjust the range of rotation of the pointer. The first stage of this calibration is 
achieved by mounting the pointer carrier and an end of 
the support member adjacent the pointer carrier to a 
cam in such a manner that rotation of the cam rotates 
the bi-metal element relative to the pointer carrier. 
The pointer carrier is provided with a pointer pin 
which is D-shaped in axial cross-section and fits into  
 
a bore of the pointer shaft, which is also D-shaped in 
axial cross-section, such that rotation of the pointer 
carrier results in adjustment of the rest position of 
the pointer. A problem with this type of gauge is that 
the calibration stage is time consuming and expensive. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved method and apparatus for calibrating a 
bi-metal gauge. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided calibration apparatus for 
calibrating a gauge as specified in claim 1. Such apparatus can provide reliable and 
rapid calibration of gauges, thereby saving 
significant manufacturing costs. Preferably, processing means of the 
calibration apparatus is adapted to determine the 
distance between the
