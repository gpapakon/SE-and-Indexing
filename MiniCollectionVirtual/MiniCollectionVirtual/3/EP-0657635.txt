<ABSTRACT>
In this engine with precombustion chambers, 
precombustion chambers(2) are formed in pistons(3), and an 

air utilization rate in main combustion chambers(1) formed 
in cylinders(8) is improved, whereby the mixing of air with 

flames is promoted with a combustion period reduced. In 
this engine, main communication ports(5) communicating the 

main combustion chambers(1) and precombustion chambers(2) 
with each other are formed in the substantially central 

portions of piston heads(7), while auxiliary communication 
ports(6) are formed around the main communication ports(5) 

so as to extend incliningly toward the circumferences of the 
cylinders. The fuel injection nozzles(10) provided in a 

cylinder head(15) are projected into the main communication 
ports(5) in positions in the vicinity of the top dead 

centers of the pistons to close the same, and fuel is 
injected from multi-bored injection ports(22) of the fuel 

injection nozzles(10) into the precombustion chambers(2). 
The flames ejected from the precombustion chambers(2) into 

the main combustion chambers(1) are guided by the auxiliary 
communication ports(6) and cavities(4) and turnd into 

turning flows of flame jet(IS), which are mixed with suction 
swirls(S) to promote the combustion of gases in the mai
n 
combustion chambers(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine provided with
precombustion chambers on the side of pistons.A swirl chamber type engine provided with swirl
chambers for the purpose of improving the combustion
efficiency of the engine has been developed. The
swirl chamber type engine has swirl chambers formed in
a cylinder head or piston heads, communication ports
via which the swirl chambers and main combustion chambers
formed in cylinders communicate with each other, and
fuel injection nozzles for injecting a fuel into the
swirl chambers. In this engine, a gaseous mixture of
an eddy current and a fuel flowing into the swirl
chambers via the communication ports is formed and
subjected to primary combustion, and gases, such as
flames and an unburnt gaseous mixture are then ejected
from the swirl chambers into main combustion chambers via the
communication ports and subjected to secondary
combustion. There is a combustion chamber structure
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 112613/1990 
which constitutes an example of such a swirl chamber
type engine.Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 93141/1987
discloses a piston consisting of a ceramic crown and
an aluminum skirt. In this piston, a head portion of
a cylindrical aluminum skirt is fitted around the
outer circumferential surface of the ceramic crown in
which a cavity is formed, and the outer
circumferential surface of a combustion chamber and
the head portion of the skirt are fixed by a cast iron
ring.Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 26111/1993
discloses a heat insulating piston. In this heat
insulating piston, the heat insulation between a
piston head and a piston skirt is secured, and the
cracking and scattering of a heat insulating member
provided between joint portions of the two parts are
prevented.In general, the combustion temperature in a
precombustion chamber is high, and, therefore,
carrying out the combustion of a gaseous mixture at a
high fuel-air ratio is effective as measures for
reducing the production of NOx. In order to burn a
gaseous mixture at a high fuel-air ratio in an
advantageously constructed engine therefor when a 
combustion temperature is high, using a precombustion
chamber type engine is effective. In order to
increase a combustion speed in a precombustion chamber
type engine formed by providing a precombustion
chamber in a conventional engine, it is necessary that
a cross-sectional area of a communication port via
which the precombustion chamber and a main combustion chamber
communicate with each other be reduced so as to
increase
