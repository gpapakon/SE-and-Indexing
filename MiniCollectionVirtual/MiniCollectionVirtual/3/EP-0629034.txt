<ABSTRACT>
A stator of a dynamo-electric machine includes 
core pieces (11) obtained by laminating iron plates divided 

in a circumferential direction per pole-tooth unit and 
having projecting and recessed engaging parts (14a,14b) at 

their dividing faces (13), and then welding the iron plates 
by laser at their inner and outer peripheries, and a 

winding part (16) formed around each pole-tooth unit of the 
core pieces, wherein a predetermined number of the core 

pieces are bonded into a shape of a loop with the 
projecting and recessed engaging parts engaged with each 

other and rigidly welded in outer peripheries of bonding 
faces by laser in a laminating direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making a stator, and to 
a stator of a dynamo-electric machine (referred to as a 
motor hereinafter) used mainly in industrial equipment. High-density of windings and space-saving 
at the ends of windings are increasingly important to 
realize compact and highly efficient motors. Particularly, 
in order to catch up with the recent tide of high-speed 
operation, space-saving, and high output characteristics of 
a robot, it is necessary to use magnets of 
high magnetic flux density for a rotor of a servo motor of 
the robot and to increase the winding density of a stator. 
Although inserted windings have conventionally been 
practiced to achieve high density of winding, the 
technique has a demerit that a large space is consumed at 
the endsof the windings. Nowadays, therefore, the stator is 
constructed in most cases in such a manner that a core is 
divided and the winding is wound in alignment outside the 
stator, thereby to achieve windings with high density and 
saving of space at the endsof the windings. The constitution of a conventional stator will be 
described first below.  
 Fig. 3 indicates the constitution of a stator in 
a first conventional example intended for high-density 
winding and saving of space at an end of the winding. In 
Fig. 3, reference numerals respectively represent: 21 a 
first core constituting the outside of a core; 22 a second 
core constituting the inside of the core; 23 a joint part 
connecting pole-tooth units of the second core 22 adjacent 
to each other; 24 an insulator; 25 a winding part; and 26 a 
resin part. In the above constitution, the winding part 25 is 
wound in alignment outside the stator with high density 
orthogonally to the insulator 24. A predetermined number 
of winding parts 25 are inserted into each pole-tooth unit 
of the second core 22. The second core 22 is then inserted 
in the inner periphery of the first core 21, thereby 
constituting a stator core. A stator is hence perfected in 
the integrated structure when the resin part 26 is formed. Figs. 4 and 5 show the constitution of a stator 
in a second conventional example. In the representative 
example of the stator in Figs. 4 and 5, the outer periphery 
of a layered core is divided in the direction of an output 
shaft. In Fig. 4, the layered core 31 is divided half by a 
dividing face 32. Reference numeral 33 denotes a winding 
part, and reference numeral 34 of Fig. 5 denotes a resin 
part.  
 In the constitution as above, the winding part 33
