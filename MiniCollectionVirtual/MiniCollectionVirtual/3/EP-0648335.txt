<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a diagnostic method for detecting susceptibility to delivery, and to a test kit for this purpose. A low, but higher than baseline level concentration of Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1 (IGFBP-1), which is due to leakage from decidual cells, is detected by an immunological assay in a vaginal secretion sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the in vitro use of a 
specific binding substance to a protein in a secretion 
sample taken from the vagina or the uterine cervix of a 
pregnant woman for determining susceptibility to delivery, 
to a diagnostic method for 
determining susceptibility to delivery based on a determination 
or a protein in a secretion sample taken from the 
vagina or the uterine cervix of a pregnant woman, and to a 
test kit designed for this purpose. Determination of 
susceptibility to delivery is particularly important in terms 
of the appropriate timing of induction of delivery when the 
pregnancy is post-term, or when a risk of preterm delivery is 
suspected. Post-term pregnancies are a common yet difficult problem in 
connection with delivery. A pregnancy exceeding 41-42 weeks 
is considered post-term. Post-term pregnancies account for 
about 7-12% of all pregnancies, the duration of the pregnancy 
being calculated from the first day of the last menstrual 
period. About 4% of all pregnancies continue over 43 weeks. 
Diagnosis is difficult, even when the first day of the last 
menstrual period is known. Post-term pregnancy is associated 
with increased foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. 
Perinatal mortality increases after the 42nd week of 
gestation, and doubles after the 43rd week.  
 Monitoring the well-being of the foetus is vital in cases of 
post-term pregnancy; delivery is, of course, immediately 
induced if there are any signs of foetal distress. If, on the 
other hand, the foetus is well, the next step is to decide the 
appropriate time for induction. It is generally accepted that 
labour should be induced as soon as the cervix is "mature" 
(shorter, softer and possibly partly dilated.). Attempts to 
induce labour too early, i.e. when the cervix is not mature, 
lead to an increase in the number of sections. On the other 
hand, if the status of the foetus requires rapid delivery and 
it is known for sure that the cervix is not mature, the 
decision will be to operate right away.  
 The maturity of the cervix is usually determined using the 
so-called Bishop's score (Bishop EH, Obstet. Gynecol. 1964; 
24: 266). The Bishop method involves assessing, by palpation, 
the size of the cervical orifice and the length, softness and 
direction of the cervical canal. The prior art method for 
determining the maturity of the cervix is not always 
sufficient for reliably predicting the time of delivery or for 
the timing of the induction of labour and estimating the 
likelihood of

<CLAIMS>
The in vitro use of an insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 
(IGFBP-1) specific binding substance for assessing the susceptibility 

to delivery and the maturity of the cervix of a pregnant 
woman when the foetal membranes are intact. 
A diagnostic method, characterized in that for the determination 
of susceptibility to delivery the leakage of insulin-like 

growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) from the decidual 
cells is determined by detecting, in an essentially blood-free 

vaginal or cervical secretion sample, 
in which the concentration of IGFBP-1 is below the high IGFBP-1 

level caused by the presence of amniotic fluid resulting from 
rupture of the foetal membranes 

that the concentration 
of IGFBP-1 has increased to a level above the normal 

baseline level typical of pregnancy. 
The method according to claim 2, characterised in that 
IGFBP-1 is determined with the aid of at least one specific 

IGFBP-1 binding substance, preferably a monoclonal antibody 
to IGFBP-1. 
The method according to claim 2 or 3, characterized by detecting, 
in a sample extracted into 0.5 ml of a buffer solution, 

that the concentration or IGFBP-1 has increased to 
above the baseline level of below about 0.5 µg/l, and that the 

concentration or IGFBP-1 does not exceed the value or about 
100 µg/l resulting from rupture of the foetal membranes. 
The method according to claim 4, characterized by detecting 
that the concentration or IGFBP-1 has increased to a value 

above about 1 µg/l, preferably to a value between about 1 and 
about 100 µg/l. 
A method according to claim 2, 3, 4 or 5, wherein the 
concentration of IGFBP-1 is determined by an immunological 

assay quantitatively, semiquantitatively or qualitatively.  
 
A method according to claim 6, wherein the IGFBP-1 resulting 
from the leakage from decidual cells is determined from an 

essentially blood free secretion sample by detecting with a sensitive 
test a low IGFBP-1 concentration exceeding said low baseline level 

which is about the normal baseline level typical of pregnancy 
after ascertaining 

with a less sensitive test that a secretion sample 
does not have said high IGFBP-1 level resulting from rupture 

of the foetal membranes. 
A test kit for the diagnosis of the susceptibility to 
delivery, characterized in that said kit contains at least one 

specific binding substance of insulin-like growth factor 
binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and at least one label signalling 

a binding reaction between said binding substance and IGFBP-1, 
the signal(s) indicating said binding reaction being selected 

so that one positive signal indicating said binding reaction 
appears, when the concentration of IGFBP-1 in an essentially 

blood-free vaginal or cervical secretion sample, not having a 
concentration of IGFBP-1 corresponding to a high IGFBP-1 level 

caused by the presence of amniotic fluid resulting from 
rupture of the foetal membranes, exceeds the normal baseline 

level of pregnancy. 
A test kit for the diagnosis of the susceptibility to 
delivery, characterized in that said kit contains at least one 

specific binding substance of insulin-like growth factor binding 
protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and at least one label signalling a 

binding reaction between said binding substance and IGFBP-1, 
the signal(s) indicating said binding reaction being selected 

so that one positive signal indicating said binding reaction 
appears when the concentration of IGFBP-1 in a vaginal or 

cervical secretion sample exceeds the normal baseline level of 
pregnancy, and another positive signal appears when the concentration 

of IGFBP-1 exceeds a level corresponding to said 
high IGFBP-1 level caused by the presence of amniotic fluid 

resulting from rupture of the foetal membranes.  
 
A test kit according to claim 9, wherein a first positive 
signal appears at an IGFBP-1 concentration exceeding 0.5 µg/l, 

preferably exceeding 1 µg/l, and a second positive signal 
appears at an IGFBP-1 concentration of about 100 µg/l or more. 
A test kit according to claim 9 or 10, wherein said kit 
contains reagents indicating several IGFBP-1 concentrations, 

the positive signals of which appear when the IGFBP-1 concentration 
exceeds different cut-off values such as 0.5 µg/l, 1 

µg/l, 2.5 µg/l, 5 µg/l, 10 µg/l, etc. 
A test kit according to claim 9, 10 or 11 wherein said 
kit contains IGFBP-1 binding substance in two different concentrations 

and/or two labels of different colors or different 
concentrations.
