<ABSTRACT>
A multiplexing arrangement for multiplexing data 
packets from different sources into a continuous flow, i.e. 

without gaps, of serially transmitted data packets. Each 
packet is constituted by several (13) sets of n(=4) digital 

words or bytes and by at least one set of r(=1) digital 
words, with r smaller than n. The arrangement includes 

several input memory units (RAM0-RAM3) each adapted to 
receive and to store at least one packet and comprising 

several memory portions each able to store up to n digital 
words of a packet, two input registers (RGR/RGN) adapted to 

read from the memory portions either one set of r digital 
words, one set of n digital words, or both simultaneously, a 

multiplexing means (MUX) adapted to combined the read sets 
and to transfer at least a portion of the combined sets to an 

output terminal (OUT) of the arrangement. The multiplexing 
means includes buffer means (BUFF),mixing means (MIX1) and 

transfer means (MIX2) for transferring, under the control of 
control means (CNTL), portions of n digital words from the 

combined sets and for re-combining the remaining part of 
these combined sets with other sets received from the input 

registers in order to obtain the above continuous flow data 
packets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiplexing 
arrangement adapted to multiplex data packets each 
constituted by a plurality of sets of n digital words and by 
at least one set of r digital words, with r smaller than n, 
said multiplexing arrangement including an output terminal, 
a plurality of input memory units each adapted to receive and 
to store at least one of said data packets and comprising a 
plurality of memory portions each able to store n digital 
words, and a multiplexing means coupled to said input memory 
units and adapted to transfer the data packets thereof to 
said output terminal. Such a multiplexing arrangement is generally known 
in the art and therein each of the input memory units in turn 
receive a data packet. If r had been equal to n, the number, 
say y, of digital words constituting a data packet would be 
a multiple of n and could thus be stored in a finite number 
of memory portions of an input memory unit. A standard 
multiplexer means could then be used to sequentially read the 
contents of the memory portions of a first input memory unit 
and transfer them to the output terminal until a complete 
data packet is read, and this prior to reading the memory 
portions of, e.g., a second input memory unit. The input 
memory units could thus be handled sequentially and in a 
cyclic way. An optimal output speed of the data packets is 
then obtained because the digital words of the data packets 
are transmitted to the output terminal in a continuous way, 
i.e. without gaps between two consecutive data packets. However if n is not a sub-multiple of y, one of the 
memory portions, generally the last one, contains a set of 
only r digital words instead of n, r being the rest of the 
division of y by n. If the above mentioned standard 
multiplexer means is then used in the multiplexing 
arrangement, the data packets are transmitted to the output 
terminal with gaps of n-r digital words between two  
 
consecutive data packets. As a result, the output speed of 
these data packets is negatively affected. The case where r is smaller than n is however 
possible in telecommunication systems where for instance 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) data packets or cells of 
y=53 digital words of one byte each are transmitted and where 
the input memory units have memory portions of, e.g., n=4 
digital words or bytes. In that case, each data packet 
requires 14 memory portions and the 14th or last memory 
portion contains only r=1 digital word or byte. When using 
the above mentioned
