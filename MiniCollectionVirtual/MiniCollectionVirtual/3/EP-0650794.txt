<ABSTRACT>
The installation includes two broaching lines (14a, 14b) acting in succession, each one including a pulling device (16a, 16b) and an accompanying device (17a, 17b) having axes of movement aligned along a common working axis (15a, 15b). The working axes (15a, 15b) of the two broaching lines (14a, 14b) are separated by a distance at least equal to the diameter of the plate (2). The two pulling devices (16a, 16b) on the one hand, and the two accompanying devices (17a, 17b) on the other hand are located on one and the same side of the plate (2) to be broached. Means for moving the plate (2) on its support (3) are provided for moving the plate (2) between a first position for broaching in a first broaching line (14a) and a second position for broaching in the second broaching line (14b). The broaching on a first broaching line (14a) and the return of the pulling and accompanying devices and of the broach to an initial configuration on the second broaching line (14b) occur simultaneously.
