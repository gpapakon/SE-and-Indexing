<ABSTRACT>
Tumor cells which have  beta -glucuronidase and tyrosinase activity are selectively treated by administration of a conjugate of a cytotoxic compound which is a substrate for tyrosinase and glucuronic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, particularly the triacetylated form of glucuronic acid. Among the cytotoxic phenolic compounds which are substrates for tyrosinase which can be used are tyrosine, 4-hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxyanisole, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine), terbutylcatechol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, 6-hydroxydopa (3,4,6-trihydeoxyphenylalanine) and methyl gallate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to
compositions for treating tumors and other metastatic
diseases exhibiting high tyrosinase and β-glucuronidase
activity. The invention is further directed to
compositions for treating tumors having high
tyrosinase and β-glucuronidase activity in which the
toxicity of the materials used to treat the tumors is
localized at the site of the tumors.There have been many reports in the prior art
relating to the general concept of providing direct transport
of an agent which is toxic to tumor cells directly to
tumors having β-glucuronidase activity by conjugating
the agent with glucuronic acid. Among such reports are
Von Ardenne, M. et al., Agressologie, 1976, 176(5): 261-264;
East German Patent No. 122,386; German
Offenlegungsschrift 22 12 014; Sweeney et al., Cancer
Research31: 477-478, 1971; Baba et al., Gann, 69: 283-284;
and Ball, Biochem. Pharm23: 3171-3177 (1974).Von Ardenne suggest broadly many types of
aglycones which may be conjugated to glucuronic acid and
will be active at the tumor site. There include, broadly,
alkylating groups, antimetabolites, cytotoxins, membrane-active
(lytic) groups, glycolysis stimulators, respiration
inhibitors, inorganic and organic acids and cell cycle
stoppers. The East German patent also suggests many such
combinations, including 5-fluorouracil-glucuronide, aniline
mustard-glucuronide and many others. The
Offenlegungsschrift also mentions a large number of
glucuronides. Sweeney et al. disclose the anti-tumor
activity of mycophenolic acid-β-D-glucuronides. Baba et
al. note the anti-tumor activity of 5-fluorouracil-o-β-D-glucuronide, 
and Ball discloses the anti-tumor activity
of p-hydroxyaniline mustard glucuronide.Kneen in European Patent Application 054,924,
discloses phenyl ether compounds which can be used to make
tumors more sensitive to radio therapy.Rubin, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,337,760 and
4,481,195, discloses methods for treating tumors having
high β-glucuronidase activity with glucuronides with
aglycones toxic to the tumor cells with great safety
toward the rest of the body by first administering an
alkalinizing agent in an amount sufficient to maintain
the pH level of non-tumor tissues at approximately 7.4
during the glucuronide treatment to inactivate β-glucuronidase
activity in the rest of the body. Thus,
the toxic agent is directed only to the cancer cells, as
opposed to all of the healthy cells of the body, since the
aglycone is only released at the cancer site. Tumors
having high glucuronidase activity can be identified
