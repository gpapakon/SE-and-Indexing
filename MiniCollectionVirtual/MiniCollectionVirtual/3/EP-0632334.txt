<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic
photosensitive member, particularly to an
electrophotographic photosensitive member having an
interlayer which contains a resin of a specified
structure.The present invention also relates to a process
cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus
employing the above electrophotographic photosensitive
member.The electrophotographic photosensitive member
has normally a photosensitive layer on an
electroconductive support. Usually the photosensitive
layer is extremely thin, and its thickness is liable to
be irregular at defect points on the surface of the
support: such as scratches and adhering
matter. This liability to irregularities is
particularly significant in the widely used functionseparation
type photosensitive layer constituted of a
charge-generating layer as thin as 0.5 µm and a charge-transporting
layer. The photosensitive layer is required to be
formed as uniformly as possible in thickness since an
irregularity in the thickness thereof will give rise to
irregularity of potential or sensitivity.Another important characteristic property of
the electrophotographic photosensitive member is
stability of light area potential and dark area
potential during repeated use. Without the potential
stability, the formed image density will be unstable or
the formed image will be fogged.To offset such disadvantages, an interlayer is
provided which serves to cover any surface defects of
the support, to improve adhesion of the support with
the photosensitive layer, and to prevent carrier
injection from the support into the photosensitive
layer.The interlayer is conventionally formed from a
resin including polyamide resins (Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 48-47344 and 52-25638),
polyester resins (Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open Nos. 52-20836 and 54-26738), polyurethane
resins (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 53-89435
and 2-115858), quaternary ammonium salt-containing
acrylic polymers (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 51-126149) and casein
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 55-103556).The interlayer formed from any of the above 
materials, however, changes its electric resistance
depending on temperature and humidity. Therefore, an
excellent electrophotographic photosensitive member is
not obtainable which has excellent and stable potential
characteristics throughout all the environmental
conditions from low-temperature and low-humidity to
high-temperature and high-humidity.For example, when the photosensitive
