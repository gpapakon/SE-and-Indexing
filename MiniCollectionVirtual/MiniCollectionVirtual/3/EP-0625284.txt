<ABSTRACT>
The flat fuse for high rated currents is of the type comprising a case wherein is partly housed a conducting member (5, 6, 9, 10) provided with two flat connection strips (5, 6) whose free ends (7) are located outside the casing, said connection strips being connected inside the casing by means of a flat fuse part (8) on at least one face of which and substantially at the centre thereof is deposited a metal droplet (13) with predetermined contact area, and it is characterized in that the fuse part has a central calibrating zone (9) having a width (l1) smaller than the width (l2) of adjacent side aera (21) connecting with the connecting strips, the contact zone of said droplet (13) being at least larger than half the calibrating zone (9). Application particularly to motor vehicle equipment.
