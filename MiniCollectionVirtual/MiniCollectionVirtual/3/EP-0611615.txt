<ABSTRACT>
The toothed quadrant (7) is produced in such a way that, in a first operation, in the region of the toothing an undulating tooth-form part (8) corresponding to the tooth pointing of the toothing is fine-blanked using a fine-blanking machine and, in a second operation, the toothed quadrant (7) is then completely blanked out while fine-blanking the remaining tooth form. By means of this multi-stage fine-blanking, not only is the load along the blanking die very considerably reduced, but at the same time a highly precise toothing meeting every requirement is also achieved, now making production of such gearing highly cost-effective.
