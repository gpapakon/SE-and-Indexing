<ABSTRACT>
In a first starting phase, the weaving machine is run up according to a control program independent of the weaving program, until it has reached the dynamic operating state corresponding to normal weaving operation. In the subsequent second starting phase (II), the selvedge (15) is shifted into a set-aside position (15a), of which the distance x1 from the beating-up edge is selectable. With this set-aside position (15a) being maintained, a number of weft insertions are executed under normal operating conditions and the selvedge (15) is guided into the beating-up position, so that, with the weft thread last inserted, all the weft threads inserted in this phase (II) are beaten up. The formation of run-on points in the fabric is thus avoided.
