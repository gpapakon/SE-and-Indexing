<ABSTRACT>
A wind powered turbine comprises a plurality of vanes (1) 
tangentially angled about the axis (2) of a drum-like frame. 

The frame is arranged to rotate about its longitudinal axis 
(2) and it has a tubular member (5) mounted co-axially with 

the longitudinal axis (2), within the path swept by the 
vanes (1) as they rotate. The tubular member (5) constrains 

the wind to follow an arcuate path between entry and exit 
points where it reacts with the vanes (1) of the turbine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wind powered turbine 
comprising a wheel or drum of vanes to be driven by reaction 
with the wind. The invention may be used to generate 
electricity or to drive other engines, such as ships' 
engines. It is known to use a windmill type of mechanism coupled to 
a generator to provide electrical power as the wind rotates 
the blades, sails, or vanes of the windmill. However such 
conventional axial flow windmill mechanisms are costly. 
They need to be mounted high above the ground on a 
substantial standing structure to allow the blades to 
rotate. Such horizontal axis windmills also require 
constant adjustment so as to maintain their direction into 
the wind. Their speed needs to be governed for safety, but 
they are still vulnerable in storm conditions even when 
stopped. They are subject to fluctuating loading in the 
blades leading to fatigue stresses, caused by the effective 
wind speed being different at the top and bottom of their 
rotative cycle, and interference by the supporting 
structure. A number of attempts have been made to design a more cost-effective 
wind powered generator. Thus, it has been 
proposed to provide two semi-circular vanes, rotationally 
mounted directly on the ground about a vertical axis so that 
each vane overlaps the other at the axis by about one third 
of their diameter so as to create a general letter "S" 
cross-sectional profile. Such a device is generally known 
as a Savonius turbine and, though it is simple to construct, 
support and operate as a self-starting turbine which is  
 
independent of the wind direction it has a relatively low 
output efficiency. Attempts have been made to improve the efficiency by 
increasing the number of semi-circular vanes arranged about 
the vertical axis. However, the addition of a third or 
other blades does not significantly increase the efficiency 
of the arrangement although it remains self-starting. There is an improvement in efficiency with the Darrieus 
rotor, invented by a Frenchman of that name in 1927. This 
turbine consists of three half rings of aerofoil section 
rotatably mounted top and bottom about a vertical axis. The 
principle of operation of the Darrieus rotor is the use of 
vanes each of which forms one half of a Torneau ring which 
has negative drag. Such an arrangement is efficient but is 
not self-starting, and requires running up to a critical 
speed at which it is self sustaining. A Savonius turbine is 
often mounted on the axis of a Darrieus rotor to provide the 
self-st

A wind powered turbine for driving an engine, 
comprising a plurality of aerofoil section vanes (1) 

tangentially angled about a longitudinal axis (2) of a drum-like 
frame arranged to rotate in a path about its 

longitudinal axis (2), and having a tubular member (5) 
mounted co-axially with the longitudinal axis (2) and within 

the path swept by the vanes (1) as they rotate, 
characterised in that the vanes (1) are adjustable between 

a first fixed position at which the vanes (1) form a 
substantially closed cylinder, and a second fixed position 

in which vanes (1) moving into wind add to the rotational 
forces on the turbine by means of an aerofoil effect, and in 

which the leading edge of a vane (1) moving into the wind is 
closer to the tubular member (5) than is the trailing edge 

so that the vanes (1) cooperate with the tubular member (5) 
to constrain the wind to follow an arcuate path between 

entry and exit points where it reacts with the vanes (1) of 
the turbine. 
A turbine as claimed in claim 1, wherein each vane (1) 
is operatively connected to two rings (7, 9) and the angle 

of the vanes is adjustable by rotational movement of one 
ring relative to the other. 
A turbine as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
angle of the vanes (1) is adjustable automatically in 

response to changes in velocity of the wind so as to produce 
a substantially constant power output. 
A turbine as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, which is mounted with the axis (2) substantially 

vertical so that it reacts to the wind regardless of wind 
direction.  

 
A turbine as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the drum-like frame is provided with end-plates 

(4) to prevent end losses of the wind passing through 
the turbine between entry and exit points. 
A turbine as claimed in claim 5, wherein the end-plates 
(4) extend beyond the path swept by the vanes (1) to assist 

wind alignment. 
A turbine as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the number of vanes (1) is in the range 9 to 

17.
