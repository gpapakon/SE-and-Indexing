<ABSTRACT>
A latching system for an electrical connector 
(10) which includes a dielectric housing (12) having a 

plurality of terminal-receiving cavities (14). A plurality 
of female terminals (16) are adapted to be inserted into 

the cavities. Each terminal has a longitudinal axis (18) 
and a mating portion (20) adapted to mate with a male 

terminal also inserted into the cavity. At least one latch 
arm (40) extends generally parallel to the longitudinal 

axis of the terminal with a slight angle of inclination 
convergent at the insertion end to hold the terminal in its 

cavity in the housing. The latch arm has opposite ends 
attached to the mating portion by flexible tabs (44,46). 

Each terminal-receiving cavity (14) has a restricted cross-sectional 
area (50) adapted to engage and bias the latch 

arm of a respective terminal transverse to the longitudinal 
axis of the terminal during insertion of the terminal into 

the cavity. A shoulder (52) is provided adjacent the 
restricted cross-sectional area behind which one end of the 

latch arm snaps when the terminal is fully inserted into 
the cavity to prevent removal of the terminal from the 

cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a latching 
system for holding terminals in cavities of a connector 
housing. A wide variety of mating electrical connectors 
employ pairs of interengaging pin and socket terminals for 
interconnecting a plurality of circuits or wires through 
the mated connectors. The pin and socket terminals often 
are called male and female terminals. The terminals are mounted in a plurality of 
terminal-receiving cavities in a dielectric housing of the 
electrical connector. The terminals generally are 
elongated and are inserted into the cavities along the 
longitudinal axes of the terminals. Some form of latch 
means normally are provided to hold the terminals in the 
cavities against withdrawal therefrom. Generally, there are two types of terminal latch 
means, and both types present various problems. First, the 
terminals often are provided with outwardly projecting, 
cantilevered flexible latch arms which snap behind 
shoulders within the terminal-receiving cavities of the 
connector housing see, for example, US-A-3550067, 
The cantilevered latch arms have a 
tendency to bend, break and/or snag on other parts. For 
instance, the latch arms may be bent or collapsed on a reel 
of interconnected terminals during shipping, prior to 
fabricating the connector. In addition, in order to have  
 
any significant latching capabilities, the latch arms must 
be of a sufficient width which often limits the width of 
the contact portions of the terminals and reduces the cross 
section area through which a current must pass which, in 
turn, causes over-heating. Second, the connector housing may have plastic 
locking tabs which project into the terminal-receiving 
cavities for latching or locking behind more rigid 
shoulders on the terminals see, for example, US-A-4 979 912. 
Such latching systems are 
difficult to manufacture and may cause a myriad of 
problems, including but not limited to potential damages 
when removing a terminal from the connector housing during 
servicing, long term degradation due to temperature and 
humidity cycling, and difficulty in monitoring consistency 
from circuit-to-circuit or cavity-to-cavity. The plastic 
locking projections are weaker than metal latch arms. In 
addition, field servicing requires a stock or inventory of 
connector housings, because one defective locking 
projection results in discarding a complete connector 
housing, and housing replacement opens up the possibility 
of wiring errors.

An electrical connector (10) which includes 

a dielectric housing (12) having a plurality of 
terminal-receiving cavities (14), 
a plurality of female terminals (16) adapted to be 
inserted into the cavities, each terminal having a 

longitudinal axis (18) and a mating portion (20) adapted 
to mate with a male terminal inserted into the cavity,
 
and 
latching means to hold the terminals in the terminal-receiving 
cavities in the housing
,
 
wherein said latching means 

comprises: 
at least one latch arm (40) extending generally 
parallel to the longitudinal axis (18) of each terminal 

(16), the latch arm being adapted to be biased in generally 
one direction and having opposite ends attached to the 

mating portion of the female terminal by flexible tabs 
(44, 46) located in a plane generally perpendicular to 

said one direction; and 
each of said terminal-receiving cavities (14) has a 
restricted cross-sectional area (50) adapted to engage 

and bias the latch arm (40) of a respective terminal 
(16) transverse to the longitudinal axis (18) of the 

terminal in said one direction during insertion of the 
terminal into the cavity (14), and a shoulder (52) 

adjacent the restricted cross-sectional area behind 
which one end of the latch arm snaps when the terminal 

is fully inserted into the cavity to prevent removal of 
the terminal from the end cavity. 
An electrical connector as set forth in claim 1,

relationship extending generally parallel to said 
longitudinal axis (18).

wherein said mating portion (20) includes bottom wall 

means (32), opposite side wall means (34) and top wall 
means (36), and said latch arms (40) and flexible tabs 

(44, 46) are provided at the top wall means. 
An electrical connector as set forth in claim 2, 
wherein the female terminal (16) is fabricated of 

stamped and formed sheet metal material, and the pair of 
latch arms (40) are formed on opposite sides of a 

longitudinal open seam (42) of the mating portion (20) 
of the terminal. 
An electrical terminal (16) for insertion into a
