<ABSTRACT>
Using a Euclidean algorithm for error correction, 
an error correcting circuit corrects bit errors in a 

received codeword by making a difference detecting 
circuit (13) detect a degree difference between a higher 

and a lower degree polynomial. When the difference is 
equal to one, a dividing circuit (11) is supplied in a 

first stage of the algorithm with the higher and the 
lower degree polynomials as a dividend and a divisor 

polynomial. When the difference is greater than one, the 
difference is decremented by one to provide an amount of 

shift, responsive to which a shifting circuit (15) shifts 
coefficients of the lower degree polynomial to higher 

degree terms to provide a shifted polynomial. In the 
first stage, the shifted polynomial is used as the 

divisor polynomial. Preferably, an error number is 
calculated. From an error location polynomial, an error 

location number is detected. Only when the error 
location number coincides with the error number, the bit 

errors are correctable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an error correction
circuit for correcting bit errors in a codeword which is
either received or reproduced from a digital signal as a
received codeword.It is already known on correcting the bit errors
to use a Euclidean algorithm of error correction with
addition, multiplication, and division carried out on a
finite field GF(2m), where m represents an integer equal
to one or greater. Based on results of the Euclidean
algorithm, it is possible to calculate an error location
polynomial and an error value polynomial. An example is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Prepublication (A) No.
101,742 of 1989.In each of successive stages of the Euclidean
algorithm, a dividing circuit is used in dividing a
dividend polynomial by a divisor polynomial, namely, a
higher degree polynomial by a lower degree polynomial to
provide a remainder polynomial of a degree which is
herein referred to as a remainder degree. The higher and
the lower degree polynomials have a degree difference 
which is equal at least to one.Preferably, the dividing circuit is the circuit
disclosed in the specification of JP-Patent
Application Serial No. 11318/93 filed January 27, 1993,
by the present inventor. A corresponding application in the United States of America is now United States Patent No. 5,495,488. The application will herein be
incorporated by reference.The received codeword may include the bit errors
of an error number, or the number of errors, which number
is either less than a maximum number of correctable
errors or not less than the maximum number. When the
remainder degree is less than the maximum number, the
remainder polynomial is said to satisfy a condition for
error correction. Otherwise, the remainder polynomial
does not satisfy the condition. The Euclidean algorithm
is carried out consecutively in next stages until an
eventual remainder polynomial satisfies the condition.The maximum number of correctable errors will now
be denoted by t. A syndrome polynomial S(X) is derived
from the received codeword in the manner known in the
art. In the syndrome polynomial, coefficients of powers
of X are represented by powers of a primitive element Î±.
Merely for convenience and clarity of print, such powers
of the primitive element will herein be denoted by A(a)
with its index treated as if an argument. The index is
variable between zero and (2t - 2), both inclusive.
Incidentally, A(2t - 1) = A(0) = 1. In an initial or
first stage of the Euclidean algorithm, X2t is used as
the dividend or higher degree polynomial
