<ABSTRACT>
A photographic bleaching or bleach/fixing 
composition contains a water-soluble ternary complex of 

an iron ion, a polycarboxylate ligand, and a second 
ligand which has at least one carboxyl group on an 

aromatic nitrogen heterocycle, such as a 
pyridinecarboxylic acid. Preferred materials are 

biodegradable, but all of the ternary complexes can be 
used in a variety of bleach or bleach/fix processes to 

good advantage as bleaching agents. They are 
particularly suitable for use in rehalogenating ferric 

chelate bleaches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
photographic bleaching or bleach/fixing composition,
and to a method for its use to process imagewise
exposed and developed color photographic elements.During processing of silver halide color
photographic elements, the developed silver is oxidized
to a silver salt by a suitable bleaching agent. The
oxidized silver is then removed from the element in a
"fixing" step. In some processes, the two steps can be
combined in a so-called bleach-fix step.Common bleaching agents include ferric
chelate complexes of aminopolycarboxylate ligands, such
as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1,3-propylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (PDTA). These agents
perform acceptably, but are not generally
biodegradable, and environmental concerns are very
prominent in many cultures.Other bleaching agents are known which have
one or more deficiencies. For example, ferric
complexes of β-alaninediacetic acid are known, but they
are relatively slow bleaching agents compared to the
ferric-EDTA complexes. Thus, they must be used in
higher concentrations which is undesirable for cost and
environmental reasons.Japanese Kokai 51-07930 describes the use of
nitrilotriacetic acid or 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid
or both to reduce stains in neutralizing or fixing
solutions. Bleaching solutions containing an
aminocarboxylic acid metal complex salt or a
polycarboxylic acid metal complex salt are also known.
Japanese Kokai 53-048527 describes the use of such
complexes to lower fog. EP-A-0 329 088 describes bidentate complexes
in bleaching solutions which further contain buffers,
one of which is 2-pyridinecarboxylic acid (PCA).
Complexes of PCA with iron are not described.Other biodegradable bleaching agents, such as
ferric citrate, are effective only at very low pH, such
as below pH 3 (see for example, DE 3,919,551A1).
Another example of a biodegradable bleaching agent is
the ferric complex of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid
(PDCA). This complex has been demonstrated as an
efficient catalyst for persulfate bleaching. However,
the ferric complex is insufficiently water-soluble to
be used at the concentrations required for a
commercially viable bleach in which the ferric complex
is the primary oxidant.Bleaching solutions have been developed which
contain more than one ligand and which help provide
rapid bleaching without unwanted dye formation in color
photographic materials. However, such solutions
contain two distinct iron-complex salts. For example,
in KODAK FLEXICOLOR™ Bleach II, one salt is ferric
ammonium-E
