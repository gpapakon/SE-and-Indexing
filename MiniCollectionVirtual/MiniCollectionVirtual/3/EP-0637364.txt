<CLAIMS>
A throttle valve comprising a casing (8), a 
rotatable valve disc (10), a valve shaft (9) extending 

from the valve disc (10) into the shank of the casing, 
and a resilient sleeve (1) for sealing the valve disc 

(10) against the casing (8) and for sealing the valve 
shaft (9) against the casing (8) and for sealing the 

valve disc (10) in order to shut off the flow, the 
casing (8) having a peripheral groove (13) for 

receiving the sleeve (1), and the sleeve (1) having a 
peripheral collar (14) which engages in the groove 

(13), characterised in that the collar (14), in the 
region of the valve axis (9), has an accumulation of 

material (3) produced by continuous increase of the 
collar to a final thickness (6, 6') in the 

neighbourhood of the opening (2) for the valve shaft 
(9). 
A throttle valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the unwound length of the 

resilient sleeve (1) is greater than the unwound length 
of its seat in the casing (8). 
A throttle valve according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the unwound length of the 

resilient aleeve (1) is 0.5 - 1.5% greater than the 
unwound length of its seat in the casing (8).
