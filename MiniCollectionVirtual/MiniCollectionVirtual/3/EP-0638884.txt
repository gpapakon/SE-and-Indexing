<ABSTRACT>
Movement detectors (motion detectors) which are more expensive must have a precise switching behaviour and must be matched correspondingly to the respective place of use by being adjusted. According to the invention, the adjustment times are to be shortened and maladjustments (incorrect adjustments) are to be largely excluded. This is done by connecting upstream of a movement detector (B) a receiver (EM) which selectively receives a control signal (setting signal) (SS), which is assigned to the respective control variable (setting variable) and is teletransmitted (remotely transmitted), and converts it by means of an evaluator (AU) and an actuator (controller) (ST) into a control value (setting value) which can be accepted by the movement detector (E). The control value is preset by the input (EI) of a transmitter (S) which emits the control signal (SS) which corresponds to the control value.
