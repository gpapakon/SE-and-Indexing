<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shaft coupling in which leaf spring 
members 12a through 12d, 14a through 14d, 16a through 16d, 18a 

through 18d are disposed on the rear surfaces of a driving side 
flange portion 2 and a driven side flange portion 4. One end of 

each leaf spring member taken in a circumferential direction is 
mounted to the flange portions 2, 4, and the other end is 

interconnected to the other end of the adjacent leaf spring 
member. At positions of the flange portions 2, 4 which 

correspond to a portion for interconnecting these leaf springs, 
hole portions 7a through 7d and the hole portions 9a through 9d 

being each disposed at the corresponding position. Torque 
transmitting rods 10a through 10d with a clearance through the 

corresponding hole portions, and interconnecting portions of 
the leaf spring members of the driving and driven side are each 

mounted to both ends of the torque transmitting rods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shaft coupling and,
in particular, to a compact flexible shaft coupling which is
easy of assembly and repair.In various mechanisms for transmitting a rotational torque,
end portions of two rotational shafts are connected by
means of a coupling. For example, an output rotational shaft
of an engine or motor and an input rotational shaft of a pump
are interconnected by means of the coupling. In this case, it
calls for a considerable effort to install the engine or motor
and the pump carefully so that the output rotational shaft of
the engine or motor and the input rotational shaft of the pump
may perfectly align with each other. Further, even if in that
installation ample attention is paid to such an alignment, some
eccentricity or angular deviation remains between both rotational
shafts, and further, since vibrations occur in the engine,
motor or pump during operation, in order to absorb these by
means of the coupling portion, a flexible shaft coupling using
flexible members such as springs, rubber pieces or the like
has conventionally been used. A shaft coupling according to the preamble of claim 1
is known from EP-A-0 247 231.An object of the present invention is to provide a shaft
coupling which is easy to assemble and to repair. Another
object of the present invention is to provide a compact shaft
coupling. A further object of the present invention is to
provide a shaft coupling which allows the torque to be
smoothly transmitted without great vibrations being
transmitted. A still further object of the present invention
is to provide a shaft coupling which may effectively cope
with the eccentricity, the angular deviation and the axial
displacement between the driving shaft side and the driven
shaft side.In order to achieve the foregoing, according to the present
invention, a shaft coupling is provided comprising the
features of claim 1. Detailed embodiments of the
invention are described in the dependent claims. According to the present invention, a shaft coupling can
be provided which is easy of assemble and repair, and a compact
coupling can be provided. Further, according to the present
invention, a shaft coupling which is small in vibrations while
torque is being transmitted and which can smoothly transmit
the torque can be provided, and a shaft coupling which can
effectively cope with the eccentricity, angular deviation and
the axial displacement between the driving shaft and the driven
shaft can be provided. Further, according to the present invention, since
