 together are an oxo group.   MA is hydroxylated or oxidised in the lateral lipid chain by microorganisms of the order Cryptococcus and in this form is a starting compound for the preparation of moenomycin analogues which can be employed as medicaments. The moenomycin analogues have the following chemical structure:
