<ABSTRACT>
The electric lamp has a lamp vessel (1) provided with a pinch seal (4) 
which is H-shaped in cross sections. Metal foils (6), to which inner (8) and outer 

conductors (7) are connected to constitute current supply conductors (5), are embedded 
in the pinch seal (4). The metal foils (6) are each located in a respective plane parallel 

to the axis (3) of the lamp vessel (1) in a respective leg (4') of the H. This allows for a 
relatively large distance between the current supply conductors, although the pinch seal 

may have relatively small outer dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric lamp provided with 
a lamp vessel which is made of glass with an SiO2 content of at least 95% 
by weight, in which an electric element is arranged, and which has an axis and a seal, 
and current conductors enclosed in the seal, each comprising a metal foil 
connected to a conductor issuing from the seal to the exterior and to a conductor 
extending to the electric element, which metal foils are each arranged in their own plane parallel to the axis 
of the lamp vessel. Such an electric lamp is known from GB 2 103 872 A. The known lamp has a rotationally symmetrical fused seal. The seal was 
obtained in that a glass tube closed at one end or a glass rod was inserted into a tube 
present at the lamp vessel under construction, together with the current conductors 
which are arranged diametrically opposite one another. The glass tube at the lamp 
vessel is then heated above its softening temperature to cause it to collapse onto the 
metal foils. An important disadvantage of the known lamp is that the glass tube at the 
lamp vessel is heated to above its softening temperature, but the glass tube or rod 
present therein is not. The tube at the lamp vessel in fact screens the glass tube or rod 
from the heat source. As a result, this latter tube or rod does not reach its softening 
temperature and no fusion takes place between the two glass bodies, so there will be no 
or a poor adhesion of the tube or rod to the metal foils. Accordingly, there is a 
considerable risk that the lamp will be leaky. Another disadvantage is the complicated construction which requires much 
glass. The lamp has the advantage, however, that the current conductors issue from the 
seal to the exterior and into the lamp vessel comparatively far removed from one 
another. The risk of flash-over between the current conductors at comparatively high  
 
voltages is counteracted thereby. The risk of flash-over exists, for example, in the electric lamp of GB 1 
102 646 in which the metal foils are in a stacked arrangement in a pinch seal with glass 
interposed. The foils may be comparatively wide, and thus carry a comparatively strong 
current, but they lie close together, as do the conductors connected thereto. Other electric lamps such as, for example, those known from DE 25 44 
134 C2, have diametrically opposed seals through which respective current conductors 
extend. Flash-over outside the lamp is practically impossible as a result, but the lamp 
has the disadvantage that it must be connected to a
