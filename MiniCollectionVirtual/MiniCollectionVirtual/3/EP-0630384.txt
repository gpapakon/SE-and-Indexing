<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of preventing graft rejection by inducing a state of local immunosuppression at the transplant site with expression of recombinant proteins by the allograft. Also disclosed is a protein suppressor factor that is secreted by cloned anergic T-cells, blocks interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulated T-cell proliferation, has an apparent molecular weight of between 10 and 30 kilodaltons, can be inactivated by heating to 65  DEG C for 15 minutes, blocks interleukin 4 (IL-4) stimulated T-cell proliferation in vitro, is non-cytotoxic to T-cells, and does not inhibit the production of IL-2 by T-cells in vitro.

 METHODS AND COMPOUNDS FOR PREVENTION OF GRAFT REJECTION Statement as to Federally Sponsored Research This work was funded in part by National Institutes of Health grants PODK 40839, DK 36149, and P50DK39249 from the U.S. Government, which therefore has certain rights in the invention.Field of the Invention This invention relates to organ transplantation and to compounds useful in inhibiting rejection of transplanted organs.Background of the Invention For many life-threatening diseases, organ transplantation is considered a standard treatment and, in many cases, the only alternative to certain death. The immune response to foreign cell surface antigens on the graft, encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and present on all cells, generally precludes successful transplantation of tissues and organs unless the transplant tissues come from a compatible donor or the normal immune response is suppressed. The best compatibility and thus, longterm rates of engraftment, are achieved using MHC identical sibling donors or MHC identical unrelated cadaver donors (Strom, 1989, In: Organ Transplantation: CurrentClinical and Immunological Concepts: 4:8-19; Strom, 1990, Clinical Aspects of Autoimmunity 4:8-19).The host response to an organ allograft involves a complex series of cellular interactions among T and B lymphocytes as well as macrophages or dendritic cells that recognize and are activated by a foreign antigen (Strom, 1989, In: Organ Transplantation: Current Clinical and Immunological Concepts: 4:8-19; Strom, 1990, Clinical Aspects of Autoimmunity 4:8-19). Co-stimulatory 

Clinical Aspects of Autoimmunity 4:8-19) . Co-stimulatory factors, primarily cytokines, and specific cell-cell interactions, provided by activated accessory cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells are essential for T cell proliferation. These macrophages and dendritic cells either directly adhere to T cells through specific adhesion proteins or secrete cytokines that stimulate T cells, such as IL-1 and IL-6 (Strom, 1989, In: Organ Transplantation: Current Clinical and Immunological Concepts: 4:8-19; Strom, 1990, Clinical Aspects of Autoimmunity 4:8-19) .IL-1 induces expression of the IL-6 gene in accessory cells. Accessory cell-derived co-stimulatory signals stimulate activation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene transcription and expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors in T cells (Pankewycz, et al. , 1989 Transplantation 47:318; Cantrell, et al. , Science 224:1312; Williams, et al., 1984 J. Immunol. 132:2330- 2337) . IL-2,
