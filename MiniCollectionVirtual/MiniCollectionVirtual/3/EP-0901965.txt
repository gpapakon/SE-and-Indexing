<ABSTRACT>
The vehicle can be operated under its own power by a seated driver, and is converted for moving as a trailer by lowering a hinged (20) drawbar (19). The vehicle has a driver's seat (18) and controls (12,13,15), and a single drive wheel (11), which is offset to the side of the longitudinal axis. The drive unit is mounted on a hinged (17) subframe (16), which is connected by a toggle linkage to the drawbar. A gas spring holds the drawbar at the extremities of its travel. With the drawbar hinged down, the drive wheel is raised clear of the ground. The vehicle stands on a pair of fixed wheels (6), a pair of castors (7), and can be connected to a tow vehicle. When a drawbar is hinged up, subframe moves down so that the drive wheel lifts the castors clear of the ground, so that the vehicle can be driven under its own power, at speeds of up to about 8 km/hr.
