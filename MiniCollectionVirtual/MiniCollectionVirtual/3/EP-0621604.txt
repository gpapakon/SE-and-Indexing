<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering flash-EEPROM memory cells (MC) with 
low threshold voltage is described. The method provide for the 

simultaneous application of a first voltage with a first 
prescribed value (V
D
) and of a second voltage with a second 
prescribed value (V
G
) to drain regions (D) of each of said 
memory cells (MC) and to gate regions (G) of the memory cell 

(MC) for a prescribed time interval suitable for submitting 
said memory cells (MC) to a prescribed threshold voltage shift. 

A reference ground voltage (GND) is concurrently applied to 
source regions (S) of said memory cells (MC).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for recovering 
floating-gate memory cells with low threshold voltage in 
flash-EEPROM memory devices. One of the most important problems affecting flash-EEPROM 
memory devices is the threshold voltage statistical 
distribution of the memory cells in consequence of an 
electrical erasing procedure. It is in fact known that said distribution is not a pure 
Gaussian, showing an anomalous tail in the low threshold 
voltage range which may extend to negative values. Since in flash-EEPROM memories the array of memory cells is 
generally arranged in the so-called NOR logic, in which groups 
of memory cells are shunted to a respective bit line, the 
existence of cells with low threshold voltage could lead to 
errors when reading other cells connected to the same bit line. 
If, for example, a bit line contains a depleted memory cell 
having a negative threshold voltage, and a programmed memory 
cell is addressed, this latter one will be erroneously read as 
a non-programmed cell, because the depleted cell will drain 
current even if it is not currently addressed. Such problem is more evident in high density flash EEPROM 
memories, since the higher the number of cells, the higher the 
probability that some of them show low threshold voltage 
values. In such memories therefore, a tight distribution of 
threshold voltages after electrical erasure has to be 
guaranteed in order to achieve good device reliability and 
endurance.  It is therefore desirable to have the possibility, after any 
electrical erasure of the memory array or even of sectors of 
it, to recover those memory cells which show a too low 
threshold voltage or which are depleted. For this purpose a method has been proposed providing a new 
erasing algorithm based on a two-steps procedure: the first 
step consists in an electrical erasure by means of 
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling between floating-gate and source, 
performed by applying a negative voltage to the control gate 
for a fixed amount of time of 100 ms; the second step consists 
in a threshold voltage adjustment by means of a source stress 
carried out by applying a voltage of 5 V to the source with 
grounded drain and control gate for a different fixed amount of 
time of 500 ms (Yamada et al. "A self-convergence erasing 
scheme for a simple stacked gate Flash EEPROM'' IEDM Tech. Dig. 
11.4.1, p. 307, 1991). Said adjustment is achieved thanks to the activation of a 
physical effect, called Channel Electron Induced Avalanche Hot 
Carrier (shortly CEIA-HC
