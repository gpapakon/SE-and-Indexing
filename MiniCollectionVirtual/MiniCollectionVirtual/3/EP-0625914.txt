<ABSTRACT>
A dressing comprising a skin friendly pressure-sensitive continuous or discontinuous adhesive layer (2), which is coated on one side with a non-adhesive flexible polymer film (1a) and which is optionally coated on the other side with a removable release layer (3), said polymer film (1a) consisting of an uppermost layer (4) of a material which is relatively hard, and a lowermost layer (5) of a material which is relatively soft, said lowermost layer (5) being thicker than the uppermost layer (4). The dressing has a low surface friction and a good flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a dressing of the type comprising
a skin friendly pressure-sensitive continuous or
discontinuous adhesive layer, which is coated on one side
with a non-adhesive flexible polymer film, optionally with
a flexible foam layer interposed between the film layer
and the adhesive layer, and which is optionally coated on
the other side with a removable release layer.Dressings of the above-mentioned type are extensively used
for the treatment of wounds, in particular cronic wounds,
burns and surgical wounds. Dressings of the above-mentioned
type are also used for the treatment of
blisters, minor wounds and chafe wounds, as wells as
prophylactically to avoid the same, e.g. in connection
with the practice of sports or manual labour and the like,
where the skin areas, such as heels, elbows, knees and
palms of the hand are subject to particularly severe
stresses which easily give rise to the above-mentioned
minor injures. Dressings of the above-mentioned type continue
to find new fields of application. It may e.g. be
mentioned that such dressings have also been found useful
as a transcutaneous dosing means for the dosing of various
medicaments, such as hormones or nicotine.Thus, a large number of products of the above-mentioned
type are known. The products most used are the so-called
liquid absorbing bandages, e.g. hydrocolloid plasters and
hydrogel plasters.Hydrogel bandages consist of a liquid abosorbing cross-linked
polymer, such as colagen, polyvinyl alcohol and
gelatine, as well as of a non-adhesive watertight film
having a low water vapour permeability arranged on the 
side of the bandage which is not intended to face the skin
of the patient.A hydrogel bandage contains a large amount of water
already prior to use. In the cases where the bandage is
approximately saturated with water, the bandage is frequently
not adhesive and must therefore be secured to the
skin in another manner, e.g. by means of a plaster. An
example of this is the so-called 2ND SKIN® dressing which
is commercially available from Spenco Medical Ltd., U.K.
Other hydrogel bandages having a lower content of water
exhibit excellent adhesive properties. Certain modified
gellable polymers, however, are capable of maintaining a
reasonably good adhesive capability, even when they are
essentially saturated with water.Hydrogel bandages are known e.g. EP Patent Applications
