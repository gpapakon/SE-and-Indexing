<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to a monobloc dental fastener 
formed by two elements, one called the "base" (1) and the 

other one called the "body" (2) conceived to be fixed to the 
dental vestibular surface to correct dental malpositions; 

both parts, the "base" and the "body", are formed by a 
single piece of stainless, biocompatible material. The 

base incorporates a series of cavities (3) to receive a 
liquid product that when it gets solidified constitutes 

the dental cement. It has the peculiarity that this base 
presents two bendings determining the relevant radii 

interpolated towards the bending direction of the body 
for its adaptation the face of the tooth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a monobloc dental fastener 
conceived to correct dental malpositions and which is 
fixed to the dental vestibular surface. Currently, dental fasteners used for the above-mentioned 
purposes are formed by two independent elements which 
have to be clamped or fixed to each other when applied to 
the patient's denture. These elements are commonly called 
"base" and "body". The fixing of these two elements is 
achieved by means of welding. This technique, which is 
based in the use of two pieces, presents a series of 
problems and inconveniences, among which the following 
ones should be mentioned. The base is not designed taking into account all the 
specifications needed for its perfect adaptation to the 
tooth (two perpendicular curvatures towards the 
vestibular side of the tooth). There is also a series of positioning defects of the base 
itself to the body, which are mainly due to imperfections 
arisen during the welding process itself. It should also be noted, as one of the major problems, 
the need to insert an intermediate element during the 
process of joining the above mentioned elements, with the 
peculiarity that such element is not stainless. Since the 
fastener has to remain inside the patient's mouth for a 
period ranging between one and three years, this could 
lead to biocompatibility problems. The fastener which is the object of this invention has 
been conceived to solve such problems satisfactorily,  
 
considering the following novelties it implements: 
The fastener has been manufactured as a monobloc 
item, using a stainless, biocompatible metallic material. The joint between the tooth and the fastener is 
achieved by means of a mechanical fixing system, based on 
a composite made on the item or monobloc element itself. The item which constitutes the base includes a 
series of cavities where the liquid fixing material is 
poured, so that when it gets solidified, the tooth is 
mechanically fixed to the body or fastener. The base is made following a geometry adapted to the 
face of the tooth, by means of two radii interpolated 
towards the bending direction of the part defining the 
so-called body of the fastener. In an effort to better understand the main characteristics 
of the invention, herebelow is presented a 
detailed description based on a set of drawings attached 
to this descriptive report forming an integral part of it 
and where, as an illustration and without limitation, the 
following has been represented: Figure 1 shows a front view of the dental

<CLAIMS>
A monobloc dental fastener formed by two elements, one 
called the "base" and the other one called the "body" 

conceived to be fixed to the dental vestibular surface to 
correct dental malpositions essentially characterized 

because both parts, the "base" and the "body", are formed 
by a single piece of stainless, biocompatible material. 

The base incorporates a series of cavities to receive a 
liquid product that when it gets solidified constitutes 

the dental cement. It has the peculiarity that this base 
presents two bendings determining the relevant radii 

interpolated towards the bending direction of the body 
for its adaptation the face of the tooth.
