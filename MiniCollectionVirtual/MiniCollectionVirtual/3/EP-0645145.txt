<ABSTRACT>
A stabilized pharmaceutical composition containing 
paclitaxel, teniposide, camptothecin or other 

antineoplastic agent susceptible to degradation during 
storage is produced using a solvent system containing a 

low carboxylate anion content. The solvent system is a 
mixture of ethanol and a polyoxyethylated castor oil. 

The polyoxyethylated castor oil is treated with an acid 
or contacted with alumina to reduce the carboxylate anion 

content of the solvent. The low carboxylate anion 
content of the solvent provides extended shelf life and 

lower amounts of degradation by-products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a solvent 
system suitable for preparing a stabilized injection 
concentrate containing a pharmaceutical agent. More 
particularly, the invention is directed to a stabilized 
injection concentrate using a treated solvent system 
having a reduced carboxylate anion content and a method 
for stabilizing a pharmaceutical composition. Pharmaceutical compositions usually require a 
suitable solvent or carrier system to disperse the active 
agent to enable the composition to be administered to a 
patient. The solvent must typically be capable of 
solubilizing or dispersing a therapeutically effective 
amount of the active agent to produce an effective 
injection composition. Moreover, the solvent system must 
be compatible with the active agent and be non-toxic to 
the patient. Numerous pharmaceutical agents are not sufficiently 
soluble in any one solvent to enable the resulting 
composition to be effective. To overcome the 
disadvantages of the limitations of the solvent to 
solubilize the active agent, mixtures of two or more 
solvents are sometimes used. These co-solvent systems 
are suitable for solubilizing many pharmaceutical agents  
 
which cannot otherwise be solubilized or dispersed in a 
carrier system. One example of a co-solvent system incorporates a 
mixture of a polar solvent and a non-ionic solvent, such 
as a mixture of a polyethylene glycol and Cremophor EL. 
Cremophor EL is a condensation product of castor oil and 
ethylene oxide sold by BASF. Another suitable co-solvent 
system for many pharmaceutical agents is a 50:50 mixture 
of ethanol and Cremophor EL. Although these co-solvent 
systems can be effective in solubilizing many compounds, 
they are not without their disadvantages. For example, 
co-solvents of ethanol and Cremophor are known to result 
in particulates forming upon dilution with infusion 
solutions. In addition, fibrous precipitates of unknown 
composition form in some compositions during storage for 
extended periods of time. It is generally believed that 
the precipitates are decomposition byproducts of either 
components in the solvent or the solubilized agent. In WO91/02531, published March 7, 1991, Cremophor is 
disclosed as reversing the multi-drug resistance 
phenotype of a tumor cell without altering the drug 
sensitivity of the parent cell line. Cremophor is also 
disclosed to increase hemopoiesis reconstituting capacity 
and/or maintain hemopoiesis reconstituting capacity 
following perturbation of bone marrow to protect a 
patie
