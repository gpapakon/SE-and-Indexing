<ABSTRACT>
To displace a first liquid (14) through a pipe 
(12) with a second liquid (18), while preventing the first 

(14) and second (18) liquids from mixing, a plug (16) is 
formed in-situ in the pipe between the first (14) and second 

(18) liquids by injecting a self-thickening liquid therein 
and permitting the liquid to thicken. The formed plug (16) 

and the first liquid (14) are then displaced through the 
pipe with the second liquid (18). The technique is 

particularly useful for carrying out subterranean well bore 
cementing operations wherein cement slurries are displaced 

through pipes disposed in well bores.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
cementing pipe, such as casing, in a well bore A fluid of a particular type, composition, viscosity 
and/or other physical properties is frequently displaced 
through a pipe by a second fluid of a different type, 
composition, viscosity or other property. For example, 
underground pipelines for conducting fluids, such as 
hydrocarbons, e.g. oil or gas, aqueous solutions, aqueous 
dispersions and the like from one location to another, are 
commonly utilized throughout the world. Very often, it is 
necessary to displace a first fluid through a pipeline by a 
second fluid without mixing the two fluids. This has 
heretofore been accomplished by physically inserting a 
resilient plug or ball between the two fluids. The plug 
functions to separate the fluids, prevent them from being 
mixed and also to wipe the walls of the pipe and remove 
residue therefrom as the first fluid is displaced through the 
pipe by the second fluid. Fluid-separating plugs are frequently utilized in 
pipelines and in the construction and repair of oil and gas 
wells. For example, primary cementing, a principal well 
construction technique, involves the placement of a hydraulic  
 
cement slurry in the annulus between the walls of a 
subterranean well bore and a pipe, e.g., casing, disposed 
therein. The cement slurry is allowed to set in the annulus 
whereby the exterior surfaces of the pipe are bonded to the 
walls of the well bore. This bonding of the pipe within the 
well bore serves to maintain the pipe in place and to prevent 
formation fluids from communicating between subterranean 
formations or zones or to the surface by way of the annulus. The performance of a primary cementing operation is 
generally conducted after a well bore has been drilled to the 
depth to which casing is to be set. The pipe to be cemented 
in the well bore is suspended in the well bore which is filled 
with liquid drilling fluid used in the drilling operation, 
whereby both the pipe and the well bore contain liquid 
drilling fluid. A hydraulic cement slurry is pumped 
downwardly within the pipe whereby the cement slurry displaces 
the drilling fluid within the pipe into the annulus and 
drilling fluid in the annulus out of the well bore at the 
surface. When the required volume of cement slurry has been 
pumped into the pipe, a displacement fluid such as an aqueous 
solution is utilized to displace the cement slurry into the 
annulus. That is, the displacement fluid is pumped downwardly 
within the

A method of cementing a pipe (12) suspended in a 
subterranean well bore (10) filled with drilling fluid (14),

fluid (14) in the pipe (12) from a cement slurry (18) to be 

pumped therein and for wiping the walls of the pipe is 
placed in the pipe, a cement slurry (18) is pumped into the 

pipe to displace the first plug (16) to the bottom of the 
pipe and to displace the drilling fluid (14) from the pipe 

into the annulus between the exterior of the pipe and the
