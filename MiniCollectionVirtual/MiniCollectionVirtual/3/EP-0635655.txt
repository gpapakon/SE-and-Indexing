<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic vibration damper for motor vehicles, consisting of a damper cylinder filled with damping fluid in which there slides a damping piston (3) connected to a piston rod (2) and provided with pressure-dependent throttle valves, the said damping piston dividing the damping cylinder into two working spaces (21,22), and in which a bypass passage (15), the cross-section of flow of which can be controlled by a bypass valve system(s) arranged on the vibration damper and accommodated in a tubular valve housing (6), is provided for the purpose of adjusting the damping force. According to the invention, the valve housing (6) of the bypass valve system (5) is secured on the casing tube (14) of the vibration damper by means of a distance piece (10) having at least one passage (7,8) for at least one flow connection between the vibration damper (9) and the bypass valve system (5), the distance piece being concave on both sides.

A hydraulic vibration damper for motor vehicles consisting of a damper 
cylinder filled with a damping fluid, in which damper cylinder slides a damping 

piston connected to a piston rod and provided with pressure-dependent throttle 
valves, which damping piston subdivides the damper cylinder into two working 

chambers and wherein for the purpose of adjusting the damping force a bypass 
passage is provided, the flow cross-section of which can be controlled by a bypass 

valve system which is disposed outside the vibration damper and is accommodated 
in a tubular valve housing, characterised in that the valve housing (6) of the bypass 

valve system (5) is attached to the peripheral tube (14) of the vibration damper (9) 
by means of a distance piece (10) which is formed concavely on both sides and 

comprises at least one through passage (7, 8) for at least one flow connection 
between the vibration damper (9) and the bypass valve system (5). 
A vibration damper according to claim 1, characterised in that the distance 
piece (10) is connected by way of a weld, solder or adhesive connection to the 

peripheral tube of the vibration damper (9) and the valve housing (6) of the bypass 
valve system (5). 
A vibration damper according to claim 2, characterised in that the distance 
piece (10) is attached at several weld points (18) to the peripheral tube of the 

vibration damper (9) and/or to the valve housing (6). 
A vibration damper according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that a sleeve (13) which forms the flow connection between the vibration damper 

(9) and the bypass valve system (5) is provided in the through passage (7, 8) of the 
distance piece (10). 
A vibration damper according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the flow connection between the vibration damper (9) and the bypass valve 

system (5) is sealed by means of a prestressed sealing ring (12).  
 
A vibration damper according to claim 5, characterised in that the sealing ring 
(12) is prestressed by virtue of the sleeve (13) which defines the distance between 

the peripheral tube (14) of the vibration damper (9) and the valve housing (6) of the 
bypass valve system (5).
