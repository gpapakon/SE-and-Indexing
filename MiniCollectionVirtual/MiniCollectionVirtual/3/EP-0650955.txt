<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel amine compounds
useful as hole-transporting materials to be incorporated in
organic electro-luminescence devices. Furthermore, the present
invention relates to an organic electro-luminescence device
(organic EL device) which can find wide application in various
display units, requires a low applied voltage and exhibits a
high luminance and an excellent stability.Since an electro-luminescence device can emit light
itself, it is capable of providing a brighter and sharper
display than liquid crystal device. Thus, the electro-luminescence
device has long been studied by many scholars.
Hitherto, an electro-luminescence device comprising an
inorganic material ZnS has been made practicable. However,
such an inorganic electro-luminescence device requires an
applied voltage of not lower than 200 V to emit light and thus
cannot find wide application.On the other hand, the organic electro-luminescence
device comprising an organic material, though having heretofore
been far from practicable, can enjoy rapid progress in its
properties made by a laminated structure developed by C. W.
Tang et al. of Kodak Corporation in 1987. They developed a 
laminate of an organic fluorescent substance, an organic
material capable of transporting carriers (carrier transporting
layer) and an electrode. Both holes and electrons injected
from the respective electrodes were injected into the
fluorescent substance, resulting in a successful emission of
light. Thus, the light emission efficiency of the organic EL
device was enhanced. Many scholars have made studies to
enhance the properties of organic EL device, and at present, a
luminescence of not lower than 10,000 cd/m2 can be obtained.As the organic fluorescent substance which can be used
for an organic EL device having a laminate structure there has
been used a fluorescent organic dye such as tris-8-quinolinol
aluminum complex (Alq) and coumarin. As the carrier-transporting
material there have been studied various compounds
well known as organic materials for electrophotographic
photoreceptor. Examples of such compounds include diamine
compounds such as N,N'-di(m-tolyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (TPD)
and 1,1-bis[N,N-di(p-tolyl)aminophenyl]cyclohexane (TPAC), and
hydrazone compounds such as 4-(N,N-diphenyl)aminobenzaldehyde-N,N-diphenylhydrazone.
Further, porphyrin compounds such as
copper phthalocyanine may be used.The basic luminescence of such an organic EL device is
high enough to make the product practicable. The
