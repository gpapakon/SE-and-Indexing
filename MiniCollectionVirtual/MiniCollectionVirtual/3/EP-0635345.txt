<ABSTRACT>
System including a press designed to compact products in 
expanded polystyrene and similar material, thereby 

permitting ecological recovery and regeneration for 
reutilisation. After crushing the polystyrene scrap, the 

press conveys the products mechanically under the action of 
screw feeders into a pressure cylinder in which a mobile 

piston with an appropriately shaped head and an alternating 
action transforms the loose scrap into a uniform and compact 

mass with a regular rectangular shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an apparatus for compacting material like
expanded polystyrene, reducing protective product packaging waste
to a compact and homogeneous mass which is easy to manage and
store, for later utilisation and recovery.It is known that expanded polystyrene is widely used to make
protective packing for many household appliances and products,
because of the ease with which shaped and sectional pieces can be
made and because of the considerable lightness of the product and its
ability to absorb knocks.Also well known is the difficulty of eliminating used packaging or
scrap because of their bulkiness and the need to crush them in order
to reduce their volume. There exist relatively complex machines for
large sizes and bulks, both purpose-built, but not for compressing
waste polystyrene material as a non-exclusive and non-specialized
function of their specific activity.The difficulty of compressing consists in not heating the material so
as to prevent its liquefying; this is hard to avoid when traditional
presses or machines not designed and built for this specific purpose
are employed.DE-A-3214907 discloses a complex installation for
compacting expanded polystyrene in which the apparatus utilizes a
steam introduction for heating the material and several steps of
cutting of the compacted products.The aim of this invention is to permit the construction of a apparatus 
based on an extremely simple machine of limited dimension which
quickly and efficiently transforms the shapeless material into an
extremely compact bar with a square or similar cross-section which
is easy to transport and stow by virtue of its minimal storage bulk.The direct and indirect advantages of the system after treatment are:
the much reduced volume (approximately 1/40th) of the material and
the very high hourly productivity, reduced complexity and size, ease
of movement and enhanced performance compared with other
traditional crushing solutions.Another aim of this invention is to develop an ecologically viable
system for the recovery of used material, like expanded polystyrene,
with minimum costs and space problems connected with the
accumulation of waste material. These and other aims that will be
detailed below are all achieved by the apparatus forming the object
of this invention which provides a
complete cycle for the transformation of protective packaging or
other disposable scrap into a homogeneous and pressed bar which is
easy to transport and store in a very small space compared with the
material prior to

APPARATUS FOR COMPACTING EXPANDED
POLYSTYRENE AND SIMILAR MATERIAL,

which comprises a complex machine comprising crushing means
for the preliminary crushing of the polystyrene scrap, and

comprising screw feeders to convey said crushed polystyrene scrap
mechanically to a pressure cylinder (6) in which a moving piston

with a suitably shaped head transforms the loose scrap, by repeated
alternating motion, into a compact mass of homogeneous rectangular

shape.
APPARATUS, as described in claim 1, characterized by the fact
that the crushing means are consisting of two counter-rotating bars

(11 and 12) arranged beneath the loading hopper and fitted with
shaped and bent radial elements for crushing the polystyrene into

small pieces or scrap.
APPARATUS, as described in claim 2, characterized by the fact
that a longitudinal screw feeder (8) is arranged in parallel

relationship with the counter-rotating crushing bars at the bottom of
the chamber in which said bars operate; the said feeder conveying

the finely crushed product axially to the end of the machine along a
second transverse feeder screw (5).
APPARATUS, as described in claim 3, characterized by the fact
that the said second feeder screw is cone-shaped with a variable

pitch and diameter for conveying the crushed product into the
compression chamber of a pressure cylinder, in which a double-acting 

piston, moving backwards and forwards presses and compacts
the material in a chamber arranged along the bottom of the machine,

said chamber having an outlet end for the issuing of the compacted
product.
APPARATUS, as described in the preceding claims,
characterized by means for making the rotation of the transverse

screw and the alternating motion of the piston synchronized and
sequential to ensure regular pressing.
APPARATUS, as described in the preceding claims,
characterized by the fact that the head of the compression piston is

shaped so as to facilitate the expulsion of air during pressing and
thus obtain a perfectly homogeneous and compact product.
