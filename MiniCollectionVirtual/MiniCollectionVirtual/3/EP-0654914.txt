<ABSTRACT>
A spread spectrum modulating apparatus includes an oscillator 
outputting a carrier. A frequency multiplier multiplies a frequency 

of the carrier by a predetermined integer N1. A frequency divider 
divides the frequency of the carrier by a predetermined integer N2. 

A spread code generator uses an output signal of the frequency 
divider as a clock signal, and generates a spread code in response to 

the clock signal. A power supply feeds a dc bias. An operation 
device executes predetermined logic operation between the spread 

code and a signal coming from a side of the power supply. A switch 
selectively feeds an input information signal to either the oscillator 

or the side of the power supply. An output signal of the operation 
device and an output signal of the frequency multiplier are 

multiplied to execute a spectrum spreading process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spread
spectrum
demodulating apparatus.In some spread spectrum communication
systems, a transmitter includes primary and secondary modulators.
The primary modulator modulates a carrier with an information
signal and thereby derives a primary modulation signal. In general,
the modulation executed by the primary modulator is of the FM
(frequency modulation) type, the FSK (frequency shift keying) type,
or the PSK (phase shift keying) type. The secondary modulator
modulates the primary modulation signal with a spread code and
thereby derives a secondary modulation signal (a spread spectrum
signal). The spread spectrum signal is transmitted from the
transmitter to a receiver of the conventional communication
systems. The receiver includes a spread code generator producing
a spread code which corresponds to the spread code used in the
transmitter. The receiver also includes a despreading circuit which
despreads the spread spectrum signal with the spread code to
recover a primary modulation signal from the spread spectrum
signal. The despreading circuit is a demodulator having a function 
inverse with respect to the function of the secondary
modulator in the transmitter. The receiver further
includes a second demodulator which recovers an
information signal from the primary modulation signal.
The second demodulator has a function inverse with
respect to the function of the primary modulator in the
transmitter. EP-A-0 555 089, upon which the pre-characterising
portion of claim 1 is based, describes a spread spectrum
communication system. The receiver of the system
comprises a despreading circuit, an angle demodulator, a
sync detection circuit and a clock signal generating
circuit.It is an object of the invention to provide an
improved spread spectrum demodulating apparatus. A first aspect of this invention provides a spread
spectrum demodulating apparatus comprising:
a spread code generator for generating a spread
code;despreading demodulation means for multiplying an
incoming spread spectrum modulation signal and the spread
code;a carrier reproducing circuit for reproducing a
carrierprimary demodulating means for demodulating an
output signal of the despreading modulation means into a
recovered original information signal; andsynchronization detecting means for discriminating a
noise level of a signal from the carrier reproducing
circuit and outputting, in response to the discriminated
noise level, a signal for synchronisation of the
despreading demodulation means; characterised in
