<ABSTRACT>
Hinge for a window sash or shutter or a door leaf or shutter, which comprises a first hinge part (1) with two spaced-apart lugs (2) which have rolls (3, 4) provided at their end and forming cylindrical bearing sleeves, and further comprises a second hinge part (6) with a lug (7) which fits between the lugs (2) of the first hinge part (1) and has a cylindrical roll provided at its end and forming a bearing sleeve (8), and also comprises a bolt which passes through the bearing sleeve (3, 4; 8). The longitudinal end surfaces of the cylindrical rolls of the hinge part (1) with two lugs (2) terminate at a distance from the first hinge part (1) itself, forming a longitudinal slit (5) in the process. Provided on the border of the cylindrical roll of the second hinge part (6) with ong lug (7) is a recess (9) which is located outside the region of the longitudinal slit (5) in the hinge position for the closed shutter or sash/leaf. The bolt (10) which passes through the bearing sleeves (3, 4; 8) is provided, on its circumference, with a pin (11) which engages into the recess (9) in the cylindrical roll of the second hinge part (6) which exhibits one lug (7).

provided spaced apart, with rollers provided at their end,

forming cylindrical bearing sleeves (3, 4), with elongated
slots (5) and of a second strap part (6) with a tongue (7)

fitting between the tongues (2) of the other strap part (1),
with a cylindrical roller provided at its end, forming a

characterised
in that
 the end faces of the cylindrical rollers of the
first strap part (1), on the longitudinal side, terminate at

a distance from the first strap part (1) with the formation
of the elongated slot (5), that on the edge of the

cylindrical roller of the second strap part (6) a recess (9)
is provided, which lies in the strap hinge position for the

closed shutter or flap outside the region of the elongated
slot (5), and that the bolt (10) engages with its pin (11)

or its nose into the recess (9) on the edge side.
Strap hinge according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the cylindrical roller of the second strap part (6) at its
two edges lying axially opposed to each other in each case

has a recess (9) for the engagement of the pin (11) or nose
provided on bolt (10) penetrating the bearing sleeves (3, 4;

8).
