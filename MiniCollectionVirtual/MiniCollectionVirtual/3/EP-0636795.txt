<ABSTRACT>
A releasable piston (3) and piston rod (4) assembly is 
provided to permit ready removal and replacement of a 

hydraulic plunger and seal in a hydraulic intensifier 
device or the like. 
The releasing means is provided by a removable cartridge 
seal (10) and expandable collet retainer (15) for the 

hydraulic plunger.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a piston rod and piston assembly
with means to releasably secure the piston to the piston
rod and more particularly to an intensifier hydraulic
system that has a hydraulic plunger seal that interfaces
against a water plunger. In such systems, replacement of
the hydraulic plunger seals or the water plunger requires
removal of a cylinder end cap. This operation requires
time and penetration of the hydraulic system which
generally results in loss of hydraulic fluid and time-consuming
cleanup.DE-A-3 033 739 discloses a hydraulic arrangement with a
piston and piston rod assembly in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1.According to the present invention, there is provided a
piston rod and piston assembly with means for releasably
securing the piston rod to the piston, said piston having
a socket formed therein for receiving said piston rod; said
piston rod being provided with an expanded head for
co-operative insertion in said socket, and said socket is
provided with retention means selectively releasable by a
release means axially deployed along said piston rod,
characterised in that said retention means is a radially
expanding retention means.For a better understanding of the invention, and to show
how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now
be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings,
in which:-
Figure 1 is a cross-section of an intensifier hydraulic
system according to the prior art; Figure 2 is a cross-section of an intensifier hydraulic
system incorporating the present releasable piston rod and
piston assembly;Figure 3 is a cross-section of an intensifier hydraulic
system showing insertion of a water plunger removal tool to
dilate a release collet;Figure 4 is a cross-section of the intensifier hydraulic
system showing removal of the water plunger in progress;Figure 5 is a cross-section of the intensifier hydraulic
system showing the water plunger in position for
reinsertion within the hydraulic piston;Figure 6 is a cross section of the release collet taken at
Section A-A of Figure 2;Figure 7 is a partial cross-section of a plunger removal
tool which dilates the collet by axial insertion;Figure 8 is a cross-section of part of a plunger removal
tool which dilates the collet by axial insertion and
rotation; andFigure 9 is a cross-section taken at Section B-B of Figure
8.Referring to Figure 1, a known intensifier hydraulic system
is shown and generally indicated by the reference numeral
1. The intensifier includes a hydraulic cylinder 2 having
a

<CLAIMS>
A piston rod (4) and piston (3) assembly with means
for releasably securing the piston rod to the piston, said

piston having a socket (12) formed therein for receiving
said piston rod; said piston rod being provided with an

expanded head (8) for co-operative insertion in said
socket, and said socket (12) is provided with retention

means (15) selectively releasable by a release means (20)
axially deployed along said piston rod (4); characterised

in that said retention means (15) is a radially expanding
retention means.
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said
expanded head of said piston rod is provided with a means

for displacing said retention means in one insertion
direction and a means for abutting said retention means in

a second removal direction.
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
release means comprises a cylindrical removal tool (20)

axially deployable concentrically about said piston rod and
being provided with a bevelled external end (25) for

radially displacing said retention means upon axial
deployment of said cylindrical removal tool into engagement

with said piston and thereupon permit release of said
piston rod from said piston.
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
release means comprises a cylindrical removal tool (20')

axially deployable concentrically about said piston rod and 
being provided with a castle headed end (25') for radially

displacing said retention means upon axial deployment of
said cylindrical removal tool into engagement with said

piston and rotation thereof relative to said piston and
thereupon permit release of said piston rod from said

piston.
An assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said piston and piston rod is a hydraulic

plunger.
An intensifier hydraulic system incorporating an
assembly according to claim 5.
