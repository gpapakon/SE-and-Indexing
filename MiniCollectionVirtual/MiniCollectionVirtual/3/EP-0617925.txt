<ABSTRACT>
A monitor 6 for the return electrode 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 of electrosurgery apparatus has 
three contacts P1, P2, EN in a socket 60 that connect with two or three contacts on a plug 13, 

23, 33, 45, 55 connected to the return electrode. One pair of contacts P2 and EN in the socket 
60 is connected across an oscillator 103 that provides an output to a first primary winding 104 

of the transformer 105 when there is a low impedance between the contacts. Another pair of 
contacts P1 are P2 is connected across a second primary winding 108 and produces a loading 

on the transformer when short circuited by the return electrode. A detector 113 is connected to 
the secondary winding 112 of the transformer and produces an alarm and disable signal if the 

signal on the secondary winding falls below an upper limit or exceeds a lower limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrosurgery monitor assemblies of the kind including a 
monitor unit, a large area return electrode, and a cable connected at one end to the electrode 
and at its other end to a connector, the monitor unit including two input contacts that make 
electrical connection with different parts of the connector, an oscillator having an input 
coupled with the two input contacts such that the output of the oscillator is dependent on a 
connection being established between the two input connections and a detector responsive to 
the output of the oscillator to provide an alarm signal in the event of the absence of a correct 
connection at the input connections. Electrosurgery apparatus, such as diathermy apparatus, employs high frequency RF 
energy to produce a surgical cutting or coagulation effect, or a combination of these effects. 
The energy is applied to the patient via a hand-held, patient electrode, which concentrates the 
energy in a small region so that the current density in that region is sufficiently high to produce 
the desired effect. Energy is returned to the electrosurgery unit via a large area, return electrode 
in the form of a flexible plate attached to the body. The large area of contact of the return 
electrode with the patient's skin ensures that the electrosurgery energy at the underlying skin 
surface has a much lower current density; in this way, no electrosurgery effect is produced at 
the return electrode. A problem occurs with electrosurgery apparatus if the return electrode is not connected 
to the apparatus, since there will be no return path via the apparatus; this can lead to RF energy 
returning to earth via an alternative route. There is also a problem if the return electrode 
becomes loose, or if contact with the skin is reduced for some other reason, such as drying of 
the conductive gel used between the electrode and the skin; this can result in a more localized 
contact of the return plate with the skin. In both cases, a higher return current density may 
result, which in turn can produce burning of the skin.  
 In order to reduce the risk of burn injury to the patient, it is common practice for the 
electrosurgery apparatus to include some form of monitor to detect incorrect connection of the 
return electrode to the apparatus and separation of the return electrode from the skin. 
Separation of the return electrode can be detected by using a spilt plate electrode and 
monitoring the resistance between the two parts of the electrode, in the

connection with different parts of the connector, an oscillator (103) having an 
input coupled with the two input contacts (P2, EN) such that the output of the oscillator
