<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the general field
of surgical instruments and relates specifically to an
apparatus for delivering a vasoocclusion coil to a
selected site within a vessel (e.g., an aneurysm) via a
catheter.Vasoocclusion coils or wires are used to
occlude a site, such as an aneurysm, within a vessel.
The coils may be of a regular (e.g., helical)
configuration or assume a random convoluted configuration
at the site. Vasoocclusion coils are described in
US-A-4,994,069. The coils are normally made of a
radioopaque, biocompatible metal such as platinum, gold,
or tungsten. In treating aneurysms it is common to place
a plurality, typically 4 to 12, coils within the
aneurysm. The coils occlude the site by posing a
physical barrier to blood flow and by promoting thrombus
formation at the site.The coil(s) have typically been placed at the
desired site using a catheter and a pusher. The site is
first accessed by the catheter. In treating peripheral
or neural conditions requiring occlusion, the sites are
accessed with flexible, small diameter catheters such as
the catheters described in US-A 4,739,768
and US-A-4,813,934. The catheter may be guided to the site
through the use of guidewires (see US-A-4,884,579) 
and/or flow-directed means such as balloons at
the distal end of the catheter. Once the site has been
accessed, the catheter lumen is cleared (i.e., the
guidewire is removed if a guidewire has been used), the
coil is placed in the proximal end of the catheter and is
advanced through the catheter with a pusher. Pushers are
wires having a distal end that is adapted to engage and
push the coil distally as the pusher is advanced through
the catheter. When the coil reaches the distal end of
the catheter it is plunged therefrom by the pusher into
the vessel. This technique of plunging the coil from the
distal end of the catheter has undesirable limitations.
First, because of the plunging action, the positioning of
the coil at the site cannot be controlled to a fine
degree of accuracy. Second, once plunged from the
catheter, it is difficult to reposition or retrieve the
coil if desired. Indeed, another device, called a
retriever, must be threaded through the catheter to snare
the coil to reposition or retrieve it.In view of these limitations, techniques have
recently been developed to enable more accurate placement
of coils within a vessel. In one technique (described in
WO 91/13592)
the coil is bonded via a metal-to-metal joint
to the distal end of a pusher made of a different metal
than the coil. The

<CLAIMS>
A detachable pusher-vasoocclusive coil assembly
(11) for use in occluding a vessel at a selected site

within the vessel, the assembly comprising in combination:

(a) a vasoocclusive coil (13) having a proximal end
that defines a helical coil; and
(b) a pusher (12) having a distal end (17) that is
threaded into said helical coil to couple the vasoocclusive

coil to the pusher and which is adapted to be unthreaded
from said helical coil by twisting whereby to uncouple the

vasoocclusive coil from the pusher, characterised in that
the assembly further comprises:
(c) means (14) for holding the proximal end of the
vasoocclusive coil (13) in place while the distal end (17)

of the pusher (12) is unthreaded from said helical coil.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein said means is
a sleeve (14) that:


(i) is received coaxially about the pusher (12);
(ii) has a smaller inner diameter than the outer
diameter of the helical coil; and
(iii) has a distal edge (22) which abuts the proximal
end of the helical coil.
The assembly of claim 2, wherein said sleeve
distal edge (22) has a step (23) that interlocks with the

proximal end of the helical coil to prevent the helical
coil from rotating during said unthreading.
The assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the distal end (17) of the pusher (12) is

within and in a coaxial relationship with the helical coil.
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the distal end (17) of the pusher (12) is a coil

interfitting substantially with the helical coil.
The assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the distal end (17) of the pusher (12)

defines a tapered coil (20, 21).
The assembly of claim 6, wherein the tapered 
coil (20) has a circular cross-section.
The assembly of claim 6, wherein the tapered
coil (21) has a rectangular cross-section.
