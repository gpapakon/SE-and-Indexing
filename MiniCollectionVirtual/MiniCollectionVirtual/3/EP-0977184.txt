<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adaptive writing
method for a high-density optical recording apparatus and
a circuit thereof, and more particularly, to an adaptive
writing method for optimizing light power of a light
source, e.g., a laser diode, to be suitable to
characteristics of a recording apparatus, and a circuit
thereof.With the multi-media era requiring high-capacity
recording media, optical recording systems employing high-capacity
recording media, such as a magnetic optical disc
drive (MODD) or a digital versatile disc random access
memory (DVD-RAM) drive, have been widely used.As the recoding density increases, such optical
recording systems require optimal and high-precision
states. In general, with an increase in recording
density, temporal fluctuation (to be referred to as
jitter, hereinafter) in a data domain increases. Thus, in
order to attain high-density recording, it is very
important to minimize the jitter.Conventionally, a write pulse is formed as specified
in the DVD-RAM format shown in Figure 1B, with respect to
input NRZI (Non-Return to Zero Inversion) data having
marks of 3T, 5T and 11T (T being the channel clock
duration), as shown in Figure 1A. Here, the NRZI data is
divided into mark and space. The spaces are in an erase
power level for overwriting. The waveform of a write 
pulse for marks equal to or longer than 3T mark, that is,
3T, 4T,...11T and 14T is comprised of a first pulse, a
last pulse and a multi-pulse train. Here, only the number
of pulses in the multi-pulse train is varied depending on
the magnitude of a mark.In other words, the waveform of the write pulse
comprises a combination of read power (Figure 1C), peak
power or write power (Figure 1D) and bias power or erase
power (Figure 1E). Here, the respective power signals
shown in Figures 1C, 1D and 1E are all low-active signals.The waveform of the write pulse is the same as that in
accordance with the first generation 2.6 GB DVD-RAM
standard. In other words, in accordance with the 2.6 GB
DVD-RAM standard, the waveform of the write pulse is
comprised of a first pulse, a multi-pulse train and a last
pulse. Although the rising edge of the first pulse or the
falling edge of the last pulse can be read from a lead-in
area to be used, adaptive writing is not possible since
the write pulse is fixed to be constant.Therefore, when a write operation is performed by
forming such a write pulse as shown in Figure 1B, severe
thermal interference may occur back and forth with respect
to a mark in accordance with input NRZI
