<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for the intermittent straightening of wire, separate drives are provided for the wire feed and the straightening rotor. The speed of rotation (v2) of the straightening rotor varies essentially in synchronism with the feeding speed (v1) of the wire. To cut the wire (t4), the wire and the rotor are halted. According to the invention, the direction of rotation of the rotor is reversed between successive working cycles.

Process for the intermittent straightening 
of wire (1), in the case of which, during an 

operating cycle (t
1
, ..., t
4
) 

a) the wire (1) is accelerated to a predetermined 
feed speed (t
1
), 
b) is radially deflected by means of a group of 
guide blocks (22.1, 22.2, 22.3) of a guide rotor 

(2) which is mounted so as not to travel and which 
rotates at a given angular speed, and 
c) is decelerated (t
3
) for a subsequent wire 
processing (3)
 
characterised in that 
d) the guide rotor (2) has a direction of rotation 
which alternates repeatedly between the operating 

cycles (t
1
, ..., t
4
 and t
5
, ..., t
8
). 
Process according to Claim 1,
  
 

characterised in that the direction of rotation is 
selected periodically. 
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the guide rotor (2) is 

brought, at the end of an operating cycle (t
41
), 
into an angular position in which the rotational 

torque which is caused by a resilient twisting of 
the wire (1) in the guide rotor (2) is 

substantially nil. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the wire (1) and the guide 

rotor (2) are synchronously accelerated (t
1
) and 
decelerated (t
3
). 
Device for performing the process 
according to Claim 1, comprising feed means for 

transporting the wire and a rotatable guide rotor 
for the radial deflection of the wire, 

characterised in that the feed means (4.1, 4.2, 
4.3) and the guide rotor (2) are driven and are 

controlled by a common control device (15). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the control circuit (15) is formed such 

that the direction of rotation alters 
periodically.  

 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the control circuit (15) is 

programmable (14) for the purpose of setting the 
ratio of the feed speed of the wire (1) to the 

angle speed of the directional rotor (2). 
Device according to one of Claims 5 or 7, 
characterised in that the control circuit (15) is 

formed in such a manner that, for the purpose of 
minimising the rotational torque exerted by the 

wire (1) at the end of an operating cycle, the 
guide rotor (2) is turned briefly in the opposite 

direction to that which is used in the operating 
cycle.
