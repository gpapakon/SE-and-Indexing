<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to two phase pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient an MAO inhibitor and an uptake inhibitor together with usual pharmaceutical auxiliaries. The compositions can be used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. As active ingredient optionally N-(1-phenyl-isopropyl)-N-methyl-propinylamine or N-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-isoprop-1-yl-N-methyl-propinylamine or their salts, optically active isomers or metabolites are used both as MAO inhibitor and as uptake inhibitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Pharmaceutical composition and process for the preparation thereofThe invention relates to a pharmaceutical composi¬ tion, suitable for the treatment of neurodegenerative di- seases, containing active ingredients, resulting adequate concentrations in time and level, both in the blood and the brain, and to a process for the preparation thereof.It is known, that monoamine oxidase (MAO) is one of the main metabolizing enzyme [Blaschko H. Pharmacol. Rev. 4, 415, (1951)] of biogenic amines occurring in the human nerve cells. Due to its activity the biogenic amines, playing an essential role in the neurotransmission, are decomposed into ineffective metabolites. It was recognised that in certain diseases the level of the brain biogenic amines was decreased.Agents, which inhibit the metabolizing enzyme (en¬ zymes) can restore the normal level of these amines. This is the reason why MAO inhibitors were introduced in the human therapy. There are observations that MAO-inhibitions may lead to a serious side effect which is connected to tyramine (structurally a biogenic amine) potentiation ("cheese reaction") which is derived from foods and may induce blood pressure increase, and can be lethal. [Piackar and co-workers, Psychopharmacology 72., 3087, (1981)].MAO exists in two forms, termed MAO-A and MAO-B. Inhibiting the B form selectively, the A form is able to decompose tyramine, which is a mixed type of substrate and the dangerous side effect can be avoided. This can be re- gistered in the case of (-)-deprenyl, [ (-)N-(-l-phenyl- -isopropyl)-N-methyl-propinylamine-hydrochloride) ] which selectively and irreversibly inhibits the MAO-B enzyme [Elsworth et al., Psychopharmacology 5_7, 33, (1978)]. Be¬ cause of the irreversible inhibition, the recovery of the enzyme activity can be due to new enzyme resynthesis.The development of the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme involves two steps. The first one is reversible 

" and only the formation of the second enzyme-inhibitor complex becomes irreversible. The half life of enzyme re¬ generation is 7-8 days. [Oreland et al. , J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 32., 55-59 (1990)]. The substrate specificities of the enzymes and the selectivity of the mostly known inhibitors are reviewed by Dostert and his co-workers. [Medicinal Research Reviews, Vol 9, No. 1. 45-89, (1989)].Balard [Science 219, 979-980, (1980)] and Burns (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 8 / 4546-4550 (1983)] described that MPTP (l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) due to its neurotoxic activity evokes parkinsonian
