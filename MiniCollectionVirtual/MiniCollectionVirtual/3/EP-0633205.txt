<ABSTRACT>
A method of collecting a plurality of commodities 
comprises the steps of densifying each of the pluralities of 

commodities into a plurality of densified materials, 
collecting the plurality of densified materials into at least 

one of a plurality of segregated temporary storage bins (30,31,32), and 
transferring at least one of the plurality of densified 

materials to at least one of a plurality of segregated 
storage compartments (93) on a mobile multi-compartment storage 

vehicle (90).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the collection and storage of 
recyclable commodities. More particularly, the invention 
relates to systems for collecting, densifying and storing 
used beverage containers of various types. Even more 
particularly, the invention relates to a method for 
collecting a plurality of commodities wherein the densified 
commodities are transferred to a mobile multi-compartment 
storage vehicle. In recent years, with increasing emphasis on energy 
conservation, the recycling of used beverage containers and 
other similar commodities has become an important factor in 
the conservation effort. More specifically, the recycling of 
aluminum, glass and plastic containers has proven to be 
energy efficient, and environmentally beneficial. In addition, numerous jurisdictions have enacted 
mandatory deposit laws which require deposits on all beverage 
containers. Such laws create additional problems for the 
grocery industry, and burdens for those tasked with 
collecting the containers, paying the refunds, and storing 
the returned commodities. A number of machines have been 
developed in the prior art for encouraging the recovery and 
recycling of beverage containers. For example, Applicant's 
assignee is the owner of the U.S. Patent Numbers 4,440,284; 
4,573,641; 4,492,295; and 4,784,251. All of these patents 
relate to machines and systems for automated redemption of  
 
used beverage containers. While much progress has been made 
in the development of efficient systems for encouraging and 
effecting recycling of containers, a number of problems still 
remain in the prior art. In particular, in those areas where 
reverse vending machines are used to collect and store such 
containers, retail store operators typically must remove the 
crushed or densified commodities from the machine and store 
them for later pickup. This creates storage problems for the 
retailer and uses up otherwise valuable retail or storage 
space. In addition, in some jurisdictions, retailers are 
obligated to accept returned containers. Thus, if a reverse 
vending machine is inoperable, repairs must be made rapidly 
in order to avoid disruption of the retailer's operation to 
manually sort and store containers. Another problem experienced with prior art systems is 
the requirement for the retailer or other service agency to 
frequently add money to machines which pay deposit refunds or 
other monetary compensation for returned containers. Another problem has been experienced with removal of the 
recycled containers

<CLAIMS>
A method of collecting a plurality of commodities 
comprising the steps of: 

   densifying each of the plurality of commodities into a 
plurality of densified materials; 

   collecting the plurality of densified materials into at 
least one of a plurality of segregated temporary storage 

bins; and 
   transferring at least one of the plurality of densified 

materials to at least one of a plurality of segregated 
storage compartments on a mobile multi-compartment storage 

vehicle. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of 
densifying the commodities is performed in a reverse vending 

machine. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of 
densifying the plurality of commodities includes densifying a 

plurality of commodities composed of different materials into 
a plurality of different densified materials. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the step of 
collecting includes collecting each of the plurality of 

different densified materials in a respective segregated 
temporary storage bin. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the step of 
transferring includes transferring each of the plurality of 

different densified materials into a respective segregated 
storage compartment on the mobile storage vehicle. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of 
transferring includes using a vacuum source on the mobile 

storage vehicle to draw vacuum on the at least one segregated 
storage compartment on the mobile storage vehicle, and 

transferring the densified material into the at least one 
storage compartment under vacuum via a hose. 
The method of claim 6, wherein the step of using a 
vacuum source includes controlling a plurality of vacuum 

valves to place the at least one segregated storage 
 

compartment under vacuum, while other storage compartments are 
not under vacuum. 
The method of claim 6, wherein the step of transferring 
further includes using a vacuum source which can be disconnected 

from the storage compartment. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of densifying 
the plurality of commodities includes densifying recyclable 

beverage containers. 
The method of claim 9, wherein said beverage 
containers include containers composed of glass, of aluminum 

and/or of plastic. 
The method of claim 1, further including a step of 
transporting the densified materials on the mobile storage 

vehicle to another storage location. 
A method of collecting and transporting a plurality of 
densified recyclable commodities including the steps of: 

   temporarily storing the densified recyclable commodities in 
a plurality of respective segregated storage bins, maintaining 

a segregation of the densified recyclable commodities; 
   transferring the densified recyclable commodities from the 

segregated storage bins to respective segregated storage 
compartments on a mobile multi-compartment storage vehicle while 

maintaining the segregation of the densified recyclable 
commodities; and 

   transporting the segregated densified recyclable 
commodities to another storage location. 
The method of claim 12, wherein the steps of 
temporarily storing includes storing densified beverage 

containers composed of glass, of aluminum and/or plastic. 
The method of claim 12, wherein the step of 
temporarily storing includes storing several different densified 

recyclable commodities in the respective segregated storage 
bins. 
The method of claim 12, wherein the step of 
transferring includes using a vacuum means for placing each 

respective segregated storage compartment under vacuum, and 
transferring the respective densified recyclable commodity into 

 
the segregated storage compartment under vacuum using a hose. 
A method of collecting and transporting a plurality of 
segregated densified materials stored in respective segregated 

temporary storage bins, including the steps of: 

(a) drawing vacuum in a first segregated storage 
compartment on a multi-compartment storage vehicle; 
(b) placing a first end of a transfer hose in 
communication with a first of the plurality of segregated 

densified materials; 
(c) connecting a second end of the transfer hose to a 
first transfer valve communicating with the first segregated 

storage compartment; 
(d) opening the first valve to transfer the first 
segregated densified material into the first segregated storage 

compartment; 
(e) repeating steps (a) - (d) for a second segregated 
storage compartment to transfer at least a second segregated 

densified material into the second segregated storage 
compartment; and 
(f) transporting the first and second segregated densified 
materials to another storage location.
