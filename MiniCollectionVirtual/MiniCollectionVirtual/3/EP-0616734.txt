<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aerial arrangement, especially for communications terminals. The need for compact construction of the communications terminals makes it difficult to integrate aerials into their casings. The aerial arrangement of the invention is notably shorter than prior art aerials and can thus be particularly easily integrated. This is achieved by the approximately zig-zag folding of the long section of an "inverted F aerial".

Cordless telecommunication terminal, in particular 
cordless telephone, having an antenna arrangement 

which has an approximately L-shaped antenna conductor, 
whose short section (E) is connected at its free end to 

a baseplate arranged in the communication terminal, and 
whose long section (F) is provided, at a specific spacing 

from the bend of the antenna conductor, with a feed point 
(S), characterized in that 


a) the antenna arrangement is integrated into the 
cordless telecommunication device, 
b) the antenna arrangement is of flat design, 
c) the long section (F) of the antenna conductor, 
between the feed point (S) and the free end, is 

folded in an at least approximately serpentine shape 
and 
d) the plane, in which the serpentine part of the 
antenna conductor runs, runs at least approximately 

parallel to the baseplate.
