A method of fabricating a semiconductor thin film (4) is 
initiated with preparing a substrate (1) having a surface 

consisting of a single crystal of Si. The surface has an 
oxide film. Then, the oxide film is removed. The dangling 

bonds of the Si atoms on the surface are terminated with 
hydrogen atoms. An initial layer (2) is formed on the substrate 

of the single crystal of Si terminated with the hydrogen 
atoms, of at least one selected from the group consisting 

of Al, Ga, and In. A buffer layer (3) containing at least In 
and Sb is formed on the initial layer. A semiconductor thin 

film (4) containing at least In and Sb is formed on the buffer 
layer (3) at a temperature higher than the temperature at which 

the buffer layer (3) is started to be formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of fabricating
a semiconductor thin film adapted to be used as a Hall-effect
device which is used to detect rotations,
displacements, and other motions.Hall-effect devices using semiconductors have several
advantages. For example, they have excellent frequency
characteristics, are capable of noncontacting-type
detection, and are insusceptible to noise. They have been
used principally as noncontacting-type rotational number-detecting
sensors and have found wide application. Among
them, a Hall-effect device using indium antimonide (InSb)
which is a semiconductor having the greatest electron
mobility produces a large output signal. Moreover, a wide
gap can be secured between this Hall-effect device and a
sample to be investigated. Hence, this device is most
suited for a rotational number-detecting and displacement-detecting
sensor. Hall-effect devices using InSb include
magneto-resistors and Hall generators. The prior art 
techniques are described below in further detail, using the
magneto-resistors.Conventional InSb magneto-resistors are classified into
the bulk type and the thin-film type, according to the
fabrication process. The bulk type is fabricated by bonding
a single bulk crystal to the top surface of a support
substrate with adhesive, polishing the crystal into a thin
leaf, and machining or processing the leaf. In this
structure, the electron mobility has the greatest values of
5 to 8 m2/V s at room temperature because of the use of a
single bulk crystal. Also, this bulk-type structure
produces a large output signal. However, it is not easy to
handle this device because the electron mobility depends
heavily on temperature. Another problem is that the InSb
thin film cracks due to a difference in coefficient of
thermal expansion between the adhesive layer and the InSb at
elevated temperatures. Therefore, the operating temperature
of the device is restricted to the range from approximately
-20°C to +80°C. In high-temperature applications, for
example in automobile applications where the used
temperature range is between -50°C and +150°C, the device
lacks reliability and hence is not used.On the other hand, the latter thin-film type is 
fabricated by a vacuum process such as vacuum evaporation
techniques. In particular, a thin film of InSb is formed on
a substrate by a vacuum process and then the film is
machined or processed. The device fabricated by this method
is inferior in electron mobility to a single bulk crystal
because of grain boundaries and
