<ABSTRACT>
1. An implement for milking animals, such as cows, 
comprises a milking parlour and a robot arm (7) capable of 

carrying teat cups (80) which can automatically be connected 
to the teats of an animal. Further, a blocking mechanism (98, 

100) is provided by means of which the milk hose (101) of a 
teat cup (80) can be shut off. Particularly the milk hose is 

shut off when the teat cup rests against a robot arm end 
portion (62) in a lowermost position, while said shutting off 

of the milk hose (101) is terminated as soon as the teat cup 
(80) is moved upwardly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement
according to the preamble of claim 1.Document EP-0 091 892 relates to an implement for
milking animals comprising a robot arm capable of carrying
teat cups and automatically connecting and re-applying teat
cups to the teats of an animal. However, particularly during
separately decoupling of the teat cups from the teats
relatively strong fluctuations of the underpressure level in
the milk conduct system will occur. In US-A-4,263,874 a shutoff
valve assembly is described which shuts off the vacuum
when milking is finished or when a premature disengagement of
the teat cup assembly occurs. This device requires a magnet
and an anvil to block the vacuum inside the milk line, which
is intrusive to the milk flow and unhygienic. Also, the
device has the disadvantage that it operates on all four teat
cups at the same time. US-A-3,726,252 relates to a teat cup
assembly which comprises an inflation connected to an inlet
nipple. When the teat cup assembly is retracted, the
inflation kinks over the inlet aperture of the nipple and
shuts off vacuum to the inflation. This device has the
disadvantage that the teat cups must be retracted completely
in order to shut off the vacuum.The object of the invention is to provide for an
improved and efficient solution of these problems. Therefore,
according to the invention, the implement as described in the
opening paragraph is characterized by the features as defined
in the characterizing part of claim 1. In said embodiment the
lifting mechanism may comprise an operating cylinder which
provides for the upward movement of a teat cup and the
shutting off of the milk hose.In order to exert the pressure to block the milking
hose, a milk hose holder may be provided, mounted in the
robot arm end position, through which milk hose holder a milk 
hose is passed, while the milk hose holder grips the milk
hose at either side of the region whereover it is flattened.In a further embodiment the robot arm end portion
is slidable relative to the further part of the robot arm,
while the blocking mechanism and the milk hose holder mounted
in the robot arm end portion are located in the further part
of the robot arm, at least when the robot arm parts, slidable
relative to each other, are in the pushed-in-position.For a better understanding of the invention and to
show how the same may be carried into effect, an embodiment
thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
Implement for milking animals, such as cows,
comprising a milking parlour and a robot arm (7) capable of

carrying teat cups (80) which can automatically be connected
to the teats of an animal, and which robot arm can be turned

from outside the milking parlour to under the animal's udder
and be positioned therebelow by means of a sensor for

establishing the position of the teats, characterized in that
the implement is provided with means (87 - 97) for

individually moving upwardly said teat cups (80) relative to
the robot arm (7), the teat cups (80) being releasable from

the robot arm (7), so that, when a vacuum is produced in a
teat cup (80), the said teat cup (80) can suck to a relevant

teat and be released from the robot arm (7), the implement
further comprising a flexible connecting member (81), forming

a flexible connection between the robot arm (7) and a teat
cup (80) during milking and being capable of pulling said

teat cup (80) towards and against the robot arm (7) when the
milking flow through said teat cup (80) has ended, while

furthermore a blocking mechanism (98, 100) is provided with a
pressure member (100) by means of which the milk hose (101)

of a teat cup (80) can be shut off, the pressure member (100)
being operated by a lever (98) coupled to a lifting mechanism

(87, 92 - 94) of a teat cup (80).
Implement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the lifting mechanism (87, 92 - 94) comprises an

operating cylinder (92) which provides for the upward
movement of a teat cup (80) and the shutting off of the milk

hose (101).
Implement as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a milk hose holder (73, 74) is

provided, mounted in the robot arm end portion (62), through
which milk hose holder (73, 74) a milk hose (101) is passed,

and the milk hose holder (73, 74) grips the milk hose at 
either side of the region whereover it is flattened.
Implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the robot arm end portion (62)

is slidable relative to the further part of the robot arm
(7), while the blocking mechanism (98, 100) and the milk hose

holder (73, 74), mounted in the robot arm end portion (62)
are located in the further part of the robot arm (7), at

least when the robot arm parts, slidable relative to each
other, are in the pushed-in-position.
