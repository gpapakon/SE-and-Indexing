<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for implementing time switching, and to a time switch. In the method, the contents of the time slots of an incoming signal are written into a memory (61) at a memory location determined by a write address (WA) and read from said memory (61) at the memory locations indicated by the switching data contained in an address control memory (66). With the aim of simplifying known solutions, the switching data of each time slot is given as a relative address which indicates the location difference within the frame structure between an outgoing time slot and an incoming time slot to be connected thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method for implementing time switching and a time switchThe invention relates to a method according to the preamble of the accompanying claim 1 for implement- ing time switching, and to a time switch according to the preamble of the accompanying claim 4.In this connection, time switch refers to a device capable of switching the contents of any time slot in the frame structure of an incoming signal to any time slot in an outgoing frame structure. In addition to a time switch, this device can also be called a time slot interchanger.Cross-connection of a TDM (Time Division Multi¬ plex) signal is effected in a time switch comprising a connection memory into which the contents of incoming time slots are written, and on the one hand, means for controlling writing into the memory, and on the other other hand, means for controlling reading from the memory. Switching data is stored in an address control memory of the time switch, the memory locations of which are read cyclically - one memory location per each out¬ going time slot. The contents of a memory location indicate that memory location of the connection memory from which the information is read. In known solutions switching data consists of the absolute address of a time slot, i.e. that time slot of an outgoing signal which is outgoing at that particu¬ lar moment is given the number of the incoming time slot the contents of which are to be switched to said out- going time slot.The known solutions have the drawback of making the equipment fairly complicated.The object of the present invention is to remedy the above-mentioned drawback. This is achieved with a method of the invention, which is characterized 

by what is disclosed in the characterizing part of the accompanying claim 1. The time switch of the invention is characterized by what is disclosed in the character¬ izing part of the accompanying claim 4. The idea of the invention is to indicate the read address necessary for reading from the memory as a relative transition occurring within the frame struc¬ ture.The solution of the invention renders it possible to implement a time switch in a more simplified manner than before. As. a result of the simplification of hardware, the delay caused by it is shorter, which leads to improved reliability of operation.In the following the invention will be described in more detail with reference to the examples based on the STM-1 signal and set forth in the accom¬ panying drawings, in whichFigure 1 shows the basic structure of a single STM-N frame, Figure 2

Claims :
1. A method for implementing time switching, in which method the contents of the time slots of an in- coming signal are written into a memory (61) at a memory location determined by a write address (WA) and read from said memory (61) at the memory locations indicated by switching data contained in an address control memory (66), c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the switching data of each time slot is given as a relative address which indicates the location difference within the frame structure between an outgoing time slot and an incoming time slot to be switched thereto.
2. A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c - t e r i z e d in that the read address relating to said memory location is formed by adding said relative read address to the write address (WA) from which a fixed delay is subtracted.
3. A method according to claim 2, c h a r a c - t e r i z e d in that the relative read address is forced to become zero during the time slots which are not cross-connected.
4. A time switch for switching the contents of any time slot in the frame structure of an incoming signal to any time slot in the outgoing frame structure, said time switch comprising
- a memory (61) into which the contents of in¬ coming time slots are written,
- first means (62), which control writing into the memory (61), and
- second means (63), which control reading from the memory (61), said second means comprising an address control memory (66), the switching data of which indicates the memory locations from which data is read, 


c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said second means further comprise an adder circuit (65), a write address (WA) from which a fixed delay has been subtracted and an output of the address control memory (66) being connected to the inputs of said adder circuit (65).
