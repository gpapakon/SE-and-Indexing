<ABSTRACT>
A system for measuring the absolute position of the moving periodic scale of an incremental encoder or synchro-generator/resolver within and/or with respect to one of its scale segments which are periodically formed and/or bounded by the scale marks on the carrier, with two scanning elements arranged to be stationary with respect to the carrier and responding to the scale marks, which scanning elements are arranged at such a distance, referred to the length or to the circumference of the segment, respectively, from one another, that they output two sinusoidal and cosinusoidal measurement signals which are analysed for position determination on the basis of the arc tangent function by using for the correction of the analysis with respect to disturbances and inaccuracies in the encoder, the values or components of a parameter vector which is continuously redetermined in accordance with predetermined optimisation criteria during the continuing measuring operation and which identifies the measuring process.
