<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric
filter for selectively filtering a high-frequency
signal having a desired frequency mainly used in a base
station for a mobile communication system such as car
telephones and portable telephones. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a dielectric notch
filter. The present invention also relates to a dielectric
resonator constituting the dielectric filter.In recent years, as the development of the
mobile communication system such as car telephones, a
notch filter using a dielectric resonator is increasingly
demanded.Hereinafter, an exemplary conventional dielectric
notch filter will be described with reference
to figures. Figures 24A and 24B are external views of
a conventional dielectric notch filter. Figure 24A is
a top view and Figure 24B is a side view. In these
figures, the dielectric notch filter includes cylindrical
metal cavities 2401, a base member 2402, tuning
members 2403, and input/output terminals 2404. The
notch filter shown in Figure 24 has five resonators. A
transmission line is formed in the base member 2402 and
electromagnetically coupled with the respective dielectric
resonators, so as to constitute the notch filter.
Figure 25 shows the inside of a dielectric resonator
used in the conventional dielectric notch filter shown
in Figure 24 in a simplified manner. In the metal 
cavity 2401, a dielectric block 2501 and a coupling
loop 2502 for electromagnetic coupling are provided.
Figure 26 is a cross-sectional view showing an adjusting
mechanism for adjusting the degree of electromagnetic
coupling in the conventional dielectric resonator.
As shown in Figure 26, the adjusting mechanism
includes a supporting member 2 for supporting the
dielectric block 2501, a loop 4a of the coupling
loop 2502, a ground part 4b of the coupling loop 2502,
a handle 4c for rotating the whole coupling loop 2502,
and a pole 5 of the coupling loop 2502. The pole 5 is
composed of a center conductor 5a and an insulator 5b.
The base member 2402 includes a transmission line 7
serving as an inner conductor and outer conductors 8.
The transmission line 7 is supported by a supporting
member 9 which is an insulator. In general, the dielectric
block 2501 is formed integrally with and
supported by the supporting member 2 using glass with a
low melting point. The operation principle of the
conventional dielectric resonator having the above-described
construction will be described below. When
the dielectric block 2501 and the coupling loop 2502
are held in the metal
