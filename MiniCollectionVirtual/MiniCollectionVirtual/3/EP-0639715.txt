<ABSTRACT>
The device to supply (deliver) liquid contains a centrifugal pump (1), a hydraulic accumulator (3) secured to the pump casing (7), the accumulator and the pump having a common wall, and a controller (27, 29), which operates as a function of the water pressure, for the motor. In order to achieve essentially a very compact and self-priming design for the device, the common wall (5a, 5b) is provided between the water chamber (33) of the accumulator (3) and the impeller (6) of the centrifugal pump (1) and has at least two passage holes (36, 37) for the water, the casing construction of the centrifugal pump comprises an inner casing (5) for the pump impeller (6) and an outer casing (7) which surrounds the inner casing and has an intake port (9) and a discharge port (10), so as to form an annular cavity (14) around the inner casing, and there is disposed, upstream of the discharge port (10), a separation chamber (11) which is open towards the discharge port and has a bypass orifice (15) opening into the annular cavity (14), the chamber partly projecting into the annular cavity and there being provided, in the annular cavity (14), an offtake duct (12) running from the outlet (13) of the inner casing (5) to the separation chamber (11).

A device for the supply of fluid, comprising a centrifugal 
pump (1) with an impeller (6) and a housing construction (7) 

receiving said impeller, an electric motor (2) for the drive of the 
pump (1), a hydraulic reservoir (3) fastened to the housing construction 

(7) and having an inner membrane (32); the water space 
of the reservoir facing the impeller (6) of the pump (1) and a 

common wall being provided for the reservoir and the pump, and 
a control device (27) for the electric motor comprising a pressure 

sensor (29) and operating dependent on water pressure, characterised 
in that 


the common wall (5a, 5b) is provided between the water 
space (33) of the reservoir (3) and the impeller (6) of the centrifugal 

pump (1) and comprises at least one water passage opening 
(36), 
that the housing construction of the centrifugal pump (1), 
for forming its self-priming ability, comprises an inner housing (5) 

for the pump impeller (6) and an outer housing (7) surrounding 
the inner housing and with a suction connection piece (9) and a 

pressure connection piece (10), for forming an annular space (14) 
about the inner housing, 
that there is provided a separating chamber (11) in front of 
the pressure connection piece (10) and open to said pressure 

connection piece, having an auxiliary opening (15) exiting into the 
annular space (14), the chamber partly protruding into the annular  

 
space, and a lead-off channel (12) in the annular space, said lead-off 

channel (12) leading from the outlet (13) of the inner housing 
(5) to the separating chamber (11), 
and that the common wall (5a, 5b) partly forms a lateral 
wall part (5b) for the annular space (14) and comprises at least 

one further water passage opening (37) in order form a flow path 
leading back from the annular space (14) to the pressure side of 

the inner housing (15) via the water space (33) of the hydraulic 
reservoir (3) including the first water passage opening (36). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that an 
insert component (41) is provided for the separating chamber (11) 

for improving the efficiency of the centrifugal pump (1), said 
insert component partly preventing the inflow to the auxiliary 

opening (15) of the separating chamber and keeping open the 
passage to the pressure connection piece (10) of the centrifugal 

pump. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
separating chamber (11) is formed a cyclone. 
A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the common wall (5a, 5b) also partly forms a wall part of the 

lead-off channel (12) and that this wall part comprises, in the 
entry region to the separating chamber (11), an inwardly inclined 

flow steering surface (40). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that a reservoir-side support construction (38) for the bearing of 

the membrane (32) of the hydraulic reservoir is provided on the  
 

common wall (5a, 5b) of the centrifugal pump (1) and the hydraulic 
reservoir (3). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the control device comprises a frequency converter (27) 

fastened to the drive motor (2) and that the pressure sensor (29), 
associated with the frequency converter (27) in a technical control 

manner, is arranged on the separating chamber (11) and can be 
impinged upon, from the inner space of said separating chamber, 

by the pressure of the outgoing delivery medium. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the impeller (6) of the centrifugal pump (1), with its suction 

mouth (6a), faces the drive motor (2) and that the spacial region 
between the centrifugal pump (5, 6) and the motor (2) is divided
