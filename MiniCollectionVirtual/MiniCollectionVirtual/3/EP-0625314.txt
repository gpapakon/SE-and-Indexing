<ABSTRACT>
The procedure uses the osmotic dehydration of food 
by means of a controlled alternating change of pressures 

in order to improve the exchanges of water and solutes 
between the food and a surrounding liquid medium. Vacuum 

is used to drive the air out of the pores and refill them 
at the end of the process; the changes in pressure are 

used as a means of pumping the solution inside the pores, 
it being possible to carry out said pumping once (in 

general in the case of preserves) or repeatedly (in the 
case of salting food); the duration of each vacuum pulse 

is 1/2 or less than the duration of the process, which is 
between 1 and 10 hours, with working temperatures of 

between 8 and 20°C lower than in the case of conventional 
processes as well as times which are 2 to 4 times 

shorter, thereby providing a considerable improvement in 
terms of maintaining the taste, aroma and nutritional 

components. Equipment for carrying out the process is 
also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
Preservation of fruit and vegetables by dehydration 
(A23B7/02) Dehydration of meat and fish products (CO1G7/04.. 
A23C19/06) Acceleration of the processes of salting and obtaining 
preserves (A23B7/08..A23C19/06) Apparatus for the tinned-food industry (A23B4/00../02) The safe preservation of food from a health point of 
view, whilst maintaining its nutritional and organoleptic 
characteristics, is one of the basic objectives of food 
processing. Suitable control of the "water activity",  
 
denoted aW, constitutes one of the alternatives for 
preserving these products. Dehydration, and in particular 
osmotic dehydration, constitutes a preservation technique 
which, compared with the techniques based on heat treatment, 
does not cause the destruction of the principle 
thermolabiles, does not have the same energy costs as low 
temperature conservation systems and does not require 
preserving additives. Improved knowledge regarding the behaviour of water 
in food is helping to identify the best conditions for 
carrying out water activity reduction processes. In 
recent years various authors [Le Maguer, M. "Osmotic 
Dehydration: Review and Future Directions". Proc. Symposium 
on progress in Food Preservation Processes (1):183-309 
(1988); Raoult-Wack, A. "Les procédés de deshydration 
- Impregnation par immersion dans des solutions concentrées 
(DII). Etude experimentale et modelisation des 
transferts d'eau et de solute sur gel modèle". Ph.D. 
Université Montpellier II, France (1991)] have studied 
the osmotic dehydration of food, in particular that of 
fruit and vegetables, demonstrating its advantages and 
drawbacks. Attempts have also been made to model the transport 
phenomena which take place during this operation. It is 
therefore worth mentioning the works of Tyree [Tyree, 
M.T. "The symplast concept. A general theory of symplastic 
transport according to the thermodynamics of irreversible 
process. J.Theor.Biol. 26:181-189 (1970)],

An alternating flow procedure for improving 
liquid exchanges in food products which employs the 

osmotic dehydration of the food making use of a vacuum 
and giving rise to the exchange of water and solutes 

between the food and a surrounding liquid medium, characterized 
in that the exchange of water and solutes between 

the food and a surrounding liquid medium are produced by 
means of a controlled alternating change of pressures; 

vacuum is used to drive the air out of the pores and 
refill them at the end of the process and the changes in 

pressure are used as a means of pumping the solution to 
or from the interior of the pores, it being possible to 

carry out said pumping once (in general in the case of 
preserves) or repeatedly (in the case of salting food). 
An alternating flow procedure for improving 
liquid exchanges in food products according to claim 1, 

characterized in that the duration of each vacuum pulse 
is 1/2 or less than the duration of the process, which is 

between 1 and 10 hours. 
An alternating flow procedure for improving 
liquid exchanges in food products a
ccording to claims one 
and two, characterized in that the working temperatures 

are preferably between 8 and 20°C lower than in the case 
of conventional processes, thereby providing a considerable 

improvement in terms of maintaining the taste, aroma 
and nutritional components. 
An alternating flow procedure for improving 
liquid exchanges in food products according to claims one 

to three, characterized in that the vacuum the intermittently 
applied vacuum (vacuum pulses) corresponds preferably 

to a absolute pressure of between 50 and 150 mbar. 
Equipment for the exchanges of water and solute 
in food products according to claims one to four, consisting 

 
of one or several hermetic tanks into which the 

product to be treated is loaded, characterized in that 
the liquid with the solute which is to be exchanged is 

made to flow through the tank pre-heated to the pre-determined 
temperature and wherein the water which has 

been extracted from the food is eliminated by conventional 
processes (for example by flash evaporation), 

maintaining the concentration of the solute constant. 
Equipment for the exchanges of water and solute 
in food products according to claim 5, characterized in 

that when the process is carried out semi-continuously 
said equipment consists of one tank for loading, another 

tank for unloading, one or several tanks in which the 
conditions of vacuum are produced and at least two tanks 

(which operate at atmospheric pressure) for each one that 
operates at a vacuum. These tanks are rotated by means of 

a conventional drive system such that the corresponding 
operations can be carried out in each one.

in food products according to claims 5 and 6, characterized 

in that, as an option, a continuous sterilization 
system is included in the circuit for recirculating the
