<ABSTRACT>
In order to equip an auxiliary or signal switch (which is structurally combined with the line protection circuit breaker or residual current device and is coupled to the same for operation and release) with a switching mechanism which can be influenced indirectly thereby, said switching mechanism is based on a switching lever (1) which latches over a knuckle joint on the operating side within the built-on housing (4) having the same contour, acts on the rocker contact arrangements (2, 2') and can be unlatched by an unlatching lever (8) which is operated from the side of the protective switching device, it being possible to select the auxiliary function or signal function of the built-on switch using its manually adjustable deflection with respect to the switching lever (1).

An add-on switch for coupling on the operating and 
actuation side on protective switch gear, such as automatic 

cutouts and fault current switches, designed for selective 
function as an auxiliary switch for indication of a contact 

setting of such protective switch gear or as a signal switch 
for indication of a fault current operation in the protective 

switch gear, comprising a housing (4) having an outer form 
corresponding to the housing of protective switch gear, said 

housing [having] a contact arrangement for a plurality of 

auxiliary or signal current circuits and a switching mechanism 
for actuation of the contact arrangement manually in common 

with the protective switch gear and furthermore is able to be 
triggered by same in the event of there being a fault current,
 
characterized by 


a switching lever (1), 
rocker contact arrangements (2 and 2') provided on either side 
of the switching lever (1) and able to be actuated by same 

into a switched-on and a switched-off setting, 
a return spring (3), which urges the switching lever (1) into 
the starting setting, 
a spring-loaded control handle (6), by which the switching 
lever (1) is able to be moved, using a loose bow-shaped 

latching member (7) with a toggle action into the switched-on 
position, 
an unlatching lever (8), which acts on a latching point of the 
switching lever (8) with the bow-shaped latching member (7) 

and is able to be actuated from the protective switch gear and 
by an externally operable pivot part (11), which has a first 

abutment, remote from the pivot axis, for limiting the 
movement out of position in the auxiliary switch function and 

a second abutment adjacent to the pivot axis for the 
comparatively small limitation of the unlatching lever (8) in 

the signal switch function 
and in the signal switch function with a manually set switched  
 

off position without opening the rocker contact arrangement 
the switching lever (1) abuts a guide limb (12) of the 

unlatching lever (8). 
The add-on switch as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the switching lever (1) is pivoted generally in the 

middle of the housing (4) and possesses an intersecting two-armed 
setting element, whose one arm bears by way of the 

return spring (3) on the housing (4) and whose other arm 
possesses a detent spur (5) for the bow-shaped latching member 

(7) on a slide flank which projects in the form of a letter T 
and is limited at one side. 
The add-on switch as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2, 
characterized in that the unlatching lever (8), which is 

pivotally mounted directly adjacent to the control handle (6) 
in the housing (4), for this purpose placed in the triangle, 

possesses at one limb end a coupling pin (9) extending through 
the housing walls into the switch mechanism of the protective 

switch gear, whereas the other limb end of the unlatching 
lever (8) is designed in the form of a draw limb fitting 

around, in the switched on state, the latching point between 
the switching lever (1) and the bow-shaped latching member 

(7), a guide limb (12) being provided between the limb ends of 
the unlatching lever (8), such limb (12) corresponding to the 

upwardly extending end of the slide flank of the switching 
lever (1). 
The add-on switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a leg spring (10), 

which is wound around a pivot pin, on the housing, of the 
control lever (6), thrusts, by means of a short leg thereof, 

the unlatching lever (8) near its pivot point into the 
switched on position, and by means of a longer leg thereof 

tensions the control handle (6) and thrusts the bow-shaped 
latching member (7) against the slide flank of the switching 

lever (1). 
The add-on switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a check lever (13) 

pivotally mounted on the control handle (6) within the housing 
(4) has its lever arm extending underneath an opening in the  

 
housing for the insertion of a tool and has its actuated lever 

arm extending underneath the coupling pin (9) of the 
unlatching lever (8). 
The add-on switch as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the control handle (6) 

of the add-on switch are detachably coupled together by a 
connecting pin guided in it and able to
 be inserted in a 
corresponding hole on sides of the control handle of the 

protective switch gear.
