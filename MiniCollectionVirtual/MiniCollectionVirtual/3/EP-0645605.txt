<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sensor for
contactless determination of an angle of rotation of a
rotatable structural element according to the preamble of
claim 1.Sensors are classified into two basic types,
i.e., contact-type ones and contactless-type ones.
A typical one of the contact-type is constructed of a
resistor element and a rotating brush kept in contact
with the resistor element. The contact-type sensors
are simple in construction and low in manufacturing
cost. However, any of the contact-type sensors has the
disadvantage in being shortened in service life due to
wear on contact areas of its components. On the other
hand, the contactless-type sensors are free from the
above disadvantage. A typical one of the contactless-type
sensors is constructed of: a stator provided with
a pair of coils; and, a rotor provided with at least
one magnetic-substance portion which is so arranged as
to vary a distance between the magnetic-substance
portion and each of the coils when the rotor rotates 
to vary its angle of rotation relative to the stator.
In the typical one of the contact-less type sensors,
the angle of rotation, i.e., angular displacement of
the rotor is determined through detection of
variations in voltage in a circuit caused by
variations in inductance in the pair of the coils
forming the circuit.As for the contactless-type sensors, Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 59-174702 discloses an
concrete example of the sensors, in which a stator is
constructed of: a cylindrical yoke member; and, a pair
of coils oppositely disposed from each other in a
diametrical direction on a line perpendicular to a
central axis of the cylindrical yoke member.
In the above example, a rotor of the sensor is constructed
of a semicylindrical magnetic-substance element
which is rotatable on the central axis of the cylindrical
yoke member. In operation, the rotor assuming the
semicylindrical shape is detected in angular
displacement by the pair of the coils in which the
angular displacement of the rotor is converted into
variations in conductances of the coils, i.e.,
variations in voltage in a circuit comprising the
coils, which permits the example of the sensor to
determine the angular displacement of the rotor 
through detection of the variations in voltage.This example, i.e., the conventional sensor
for the contactless determination of the angular
displacement of the rotor has the disadvantage that
the stator is too complex in manufacturing. In other
words, in the stator of the conventional sensor, the
pair of
