<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cellular protein which is specific and has high affinity for nucleic acid sequences characteristic of an intact TAR RNA loop sequence of the HIV LTR TAR region. The invention also relates to a between 1,000-10,000-fold purified, about 185 kD protein preparation isolated from a mammalian cell nuclear extract preparation, most specifically a HeLa cell extract. The about 185 kD protein is shown to regulate HIV viral gene expression by binding a TAR RNA region of an HIV LTR template, in the presence of a cofactor fraction (including at least a SIMILAR 100 kD cofactor), and a tat protein. The TRP-185, having a molecular weight of about 185 kD protein may also provide a research tool in the study of viral and cellular gene expression. A route for the development of immunodiagnostics for AIDS and related disorders may also be provided given the specific and high affinity of TRP-185 for HIV RNA. The 185 kD protein and related encoding amino acid and DNA sequences may also be used in therapeutic agents for AIDS and related disorders and, for the generation of specific antibodies for use in the diagnosis and study of the epidemiology of AIDS.

Methods and reagents (including monoclonal antibodies) for screening/detecting viral infection in a biological sample are also within the field of the present invention.2. Background of the Related ArtGene expression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is regulated by a variety of mechanisms. The long terminal repeat (LTR) is the site of multiple regulatory regions involved in both general and tissue specific gene 

 expression. -^ Two regions, including the NFAT17'1** and NF-kappa B motifs4,19'20 are involved in the regulation of the HIV LTR in activated T-lymphocytes. Other elements such as SPI2'11 and TATA3'7'10 are involved in regulating gene expression in a variety of both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines.HIV contains an additional regulatory element known as the transactivating region, TAR, which extends from - 17 to +80 in the HIV LTR.1'3'5"7The TAR element is required for activation of gene expression by the 'viral transactivator protein, tat.9'12'20" 5 The structural integrity of TAR RNA is a key element for tat activation.5'12'^'9 TAR RNA is capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure and disruption of stem base pairing results in a marked decrease in tat activation.
