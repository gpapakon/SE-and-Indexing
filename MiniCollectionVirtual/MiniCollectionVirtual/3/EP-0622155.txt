<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a polishing pad (81, 101, 71, 
121) to improve polishing uniformity across a substrate (13) and 

a method using the polishing pad (81, 101, 71, 121). The polishing 
pad has a first region (83, 104, 74, 123) that lies closer to the 

edge of the polishing pad and a second region (82, 102, 72, 122) 
that lies further from the edge of the polishing pad. The second 

region (82, 102, 72, 122) has a plurality of openings or a larger 
average pore size compared to the first region (83, 104, 74, 123). 

Each opening or the average pore size of the second region (82, 
102, 72, 122) may be 1) between about 250-1000 microns or 2) in 

a range of about 25-1000 percent larger than the average pore 
size of the first region (83, 104, 74, 123). The polishing pad (81, 

101, 71, 121) may be used in a chemical-mechanical polishing 
without having to substantially change the polisher or the 

operational parameters of the polisher other than the oscillating 
range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor 
devices, and in particular, to polishing pads used in chemical-mechanical 
polishing semiconductor substrates. Planarization of semiconductor substrates is becoming 
more important as the number of layers used to form a 
semiconductor device increases. Nonplanar semiconductor 
substrates have many problems including difficulty in patterning 
a photoresist layer, formation of a void within a film during the 
film deposition, and incomplete removal of a layer during an etch 
process leaving residual portions of the layer, which are 
sometimes called "stringers." A number of planarization 
processes have been developed and include chemical-mechanical 
polishing. FIG. 1 and 2 include illustrations of a part of one type of a 
chemical-mechanical polisher that is used to polish 
semiconductor substrates. FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a 
chemical-mechanical polisher 10. The polisher 10 has a platen 14 
and a polishing pad 11 attached to the platen 14 with an adhesive 
compound (not shown). Above the polishing pad 11 are substrate 
holders 12, and each substrate holder 12 has a semiconductor 
substrate 13. The polisher 10 also includes a polishing slurry and 
a slurry feed, both of which are not shown. The polishing pad 11 
may be made of a porous polyurethane material that has a 
relatively uniform thickness of about 1-2 millimeters. FIG. 2 
includes a top view illustrating the relationships of motion 
between the polishing pad 11 and the substrates 13. During 
polishing, the polishing pad 11 rotates counterclockwise or 
clockwise, but the substrates 13 typically rotate in the same 
direction as the polishing pad 11. While the substrates 13 and 
polishing pad 11 are rotating, the substrates 13 are being 
oscillated back and forth across the polishing pad. The  
 
oscillating motion covers a distance called an oscillating range 
and is performed at an oscillating velocity. While the polishing is 
being performed, the polishing slurry may be recycled. In actual use, chemical-mechanical polishing typically has 
nonuniform polishing rates across a substrate surface. In many 
cases, the polishing rate near the edge of the substrate is higher 
than the polishing rate near the center of the substrate because 
the relative velocity between polishing pad and the substrate is 
higher near the edge of the substrate compared to the center of 
the substrate. Therefore, some area of the substrate near the 
center may be underpolished, some area of the
