<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for selectively supplying one of 
photosensitive materials having different widths to an 

exposure unit. 
The width (PH₁,PH₂,PH₃,PH₄) 
of the photosensitive material and the 

width of the image frame (6c) are detected. By comparing the 
detected widths with each other, the control circuit (70) will 

select the magazine (2a,2b) accommodating the photosensitive 
material having a width corresponding to that of the image 

frame. If the selected magazine is now supplying the 
photosensitive material, it continues to feed it. If not, 

the control circuit (70) will command to cut off the exposed 
portion of the photosensitive material, rewind its non-exposed 

portion by the transfer means, and deliver only the 
printed photosensitive material remained in the exposure 

unit. Then, the control circuit (70) selects the photosensitive 
material whose width corresponds to that of the image 

frame. Thus, the photosensitive material is changed over 
automatically according to the width of the image frame of 

the negative film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
selectively supplying one of photosensitive materials
having different widths to an exposure unit.US 5 187 531 A discloses an apparatus 10 for supplying the photosensitive material
15 to an exposure unit, said apparatus having a magazine 12 accommodating a roll
15b of photosensitive material having a width, said photosensitive material drawn from
said magazine being fed to the exposure unit 17; wherein said apparatus further comprises
transfer means 13, 14, 19 to 21 for feeding said photosensitive material accommodated
in the magazines to said exposure unit; and width detecting unit SU for
detecting width of said photosensitive material accommodated in said magazine.JP 62118333 A discloses a copying device comprising a plurality of magazines
2a,2b,2c, accommodating photosensitive material rolls 4a,4b,4c of different widths,
wherein a specified photosensitive material is conveyed with a conveying means from
the respective magazine to an exposure unit 20, and wherein a cutter mechanism 13
is provided half way on the conveyance path to cut a sheet to be printed with a magnified
image of an original, the size of which is automatically detected.JP 4289839 A discloses printing from a mixed image format negative film. In a conventional film printing apparatus in which
images on a negative film are continuously printed on a web
of photosensitive material, if the print size is changed,
it is an ordinary practice to replace the photosensitive
material with the one having a width corresponding to a new
print size.In order to simplify the replacement of the
photosensitive materials, a film printing apparatus is
proposed in which two rolls of the photosensitive materials
having different widths are separately accommodated in two
magazines detachably mounted to the apparatus body, so that
the photosensitive materials can be replaced and fed from
each magazine to an exposure unit.However, in such a film printing apparatus, during
replacement of the photosensitive materials, a driving
roller was rotated in a reverse direction to feed the
photosensitive material remained in the transfer path
toward the magazine and the photosensitive material is
taken up by manually rotating the roll in the magazine.
Thus, it was troublesome to replace the photosensitive 
materials. Further, since the photosensitive material was
taken up by manually rotating the roll, the tip portion of
the photosensitive material often got caught in the
magazine because the take-up speed of the photosensitive

An apparatus for supplying a photosensitive material (A1,A2) to an exposure unit
(5) for exposure to an image frame of a negative film (F1), said apparatus comprising:


a plurality of magazines (2a,2b) each accommodating a roll (R1,R2) of photosensitive
material (A1,A2) having a different width from each other, one of said

magazines (2a,2b) accommodating a desired photosensitive material (R1,R2)
being selected, said photosensitive material (R1,R2) drawn from said magazine

(2a,2b) being arranged to be fed to the exposure unit (5);
transfer means (4,7,15a,15b,16a,16b,17a,17b) for feeding said
photosensitive materials (A1,A2) accommodated in the magazines (2a,2b) to

said exposure unit (5);
cutter means (9) provided downstream of said exposure unit (5) for cutting off the printed portion
of said photosensitive material (A1,A2) that has been fed to said exposure unit (5);
width detecting means (PH1,PH2,PH3) for detecting widths of said photosensitive
materials (A1,A2) accommodated in said magazines(2a,2b); characterized in that:
said apparatus also comprises
image width detecting means (6e) for detecting the width perpendicular to the film-feeding

direction of an image frame of a negative film (F1) fed to said exposure unit (5); and
control means (70) for comparing the output of said width detecting means
(PH1,PH2,PH3) with the output of said image width detecting means (6e), selecting

the magazine (2a,2b) accommodating a photosensitive material (A1,A2) having
a width corresponding to that of the image frame based on the result of comparison, 

feeding the photosensitive material (A1,A2) accommodated in said selected
magazine (2a,2b) toward said exposure unit (5) by means of said transfer

means (4,7,15a,15b,16a,16b,17a,17b), and cutting and rewinding the photosensitive
material (A1,A2) from the exposure unit (5) to the magazine
