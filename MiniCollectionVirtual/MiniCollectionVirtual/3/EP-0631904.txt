<ABSTRACT>
A roof rail is described having a beam (1) which is supported at each end via a supporting foot (2) on the associated vehicle roof, each supporting foot (2) being provided with a fastening pin (4) for connection to the vehicle roof and a socket pin (5) for connection to the beam (1). In order to make production simpler and to reduce the weight while achieving high strength, provision is made in the case of the roof rail according to the invention for each supporting foot (2) to take the form of an injection moulded plastic body (3) in areas of which the metal pins (4) and (5) and a reinforcement element (6) connecting the latter to one another are embedded.

Roof rail for vehicles, having 

a beam (1), 
a supporting foot (2), designed as an injection-moulded 

plastic body (3), arranged at each end of the beam, for 
supporting the beam (1) on the associated vehicle roof, 
a reinforcing element (6) which is embedded in the 
injection-moulded plastic body (3), 
a fastening pin (4) which emerges from the injection-moulded 
plastic body (3) at one end, is connected rigidly 

to the reinforcing element (6) and is intended for 
producing a connection between the supporting foot (2) 

and the vehicle roof, and 
a socket pin (5) which emerges from the injection-moulded 
plastic body (3) at the other end, is connected 

rigidly to the reinforcing element (6) and is intended 
for producing a connection between the supporting foot 

(2) and the beam (1),
 
characterized in that 
the reinforcing element (6) is composed of flat sheet-metal 
part which is matched on a reduced scale to the 

contour of the injection-moulded plastic body (3), 
the fastening pin (4) has a slot opening (11) and also 
the socket pin (5) has a slot opening (10) as a plug-in 

retainer for the reinforcing element (6), 
the reinforcing element (6) is bonded, welded, soldered 
or riveted to the fastening pin (4) and the socket pin 

(5), and 
the broad sides of the reinforcing element (6) are 
aligned parallel to the broad sides of the supporting 

foot (2). 
Roof rail according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the supporting foot (2) at one end of the beam is 

designed such that it is integral with the supporting 
foot (2) at the other end of the beam, a tubular body 

(12) which is extrusion-coated with plastic material and 
is held by the socket pins (5) being located within the 

beam (1).
