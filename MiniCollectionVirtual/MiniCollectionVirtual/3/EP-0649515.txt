<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flowmeter which comprises a constriction (83) mounted in a section (2a) of the main conduit, a measuring conduit (4) which is connected in parallel across the constriction and in which a subflow (dQ) is caused to pass in response to a pressure difference across the constriction (3) in the main conduit section, a subflow meter (5) incorporated in the measuring conduit (4), and an electronic signal converter (6'') which functions to convert a signal delivered by the subflow meter (5) to a signal which corresponds to the total flow through the main conduit (2). The constriction (3) comprises a conical body (11) which is movable in the main conduit section (2a) and which functions to produce an increasing throughflow area (3a) in response to an increasing pressure difference across the constriction (3). A compensating means (6'') functions to compensate instant output signals in accordance with an occurrent discrepancy to proportionality to the total flow through the main conduit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flowmeter which is
adapted to enable the total fluid flow through a
conduit to be measured, this conduit being referred to
hereinafter as the main conduit.The invention can also be applied to measure the prevailing
rate of flow, although for the sake of simplicity,
the flowmeter will be described herebelow
with reference solely to its alternative function of
measuring the total fluid flow.The invention is a further development of a flowmeter
which utilizes a flowmeter constriction arranged or
inserted in a section of the main conduit, a measuring
conduit which extends parallel with the main conduit
section and is connected across the constriction,
wherein a subflow is caused to pass through the measuring
conduit in response to the pressure difference
across the constriction caused by the rate of flow in
the main conduit section, a subflow meter connected in
the measuring conduit, and an electric signal converter
with associated correction unit constructed to
convert a signal delivered by the subflow meter to a
proportional signal which corresponds to the total
flow through the main conduit and which is applied to
a flow registering or flow presenting means.It will be understood that with flowmeters of this
kind, the flow measured in a measuring conduit will
always have a given primary relationship with the
total flow through the main conduit and a given secondary
relationship with the flow passing through the
flowmeter of which said conduit section forms part.
This first, primary relationship is the relationship
significant to the present invention. Flowmeters of the aforedescribed kind are known to the
art and can be referred to as "by-pass flowmeters",
since a determined part of the instant, total flow
through the main conduit is caused to pass through the
measuring conduit and the volume of this flow is
determined and is proportional to the total flow
through the main conduit. These known flowmeters
include a larger or smaller fixed throttling orifice
in the main conduit section, and the measuring
conduit, or branch pipe, connected in parallel across
the constriction includes a flowmeter which delivers a
signal corresponding to the flow (or rate of flow)
through the measuring conduit.For the sake of simplification, this signal is exemplified
in the following description as one pulse per
unit of volume passing through the measuring conduit.A measured frequency multiplied by the volume unit can
then be considered proportional to the by-pass flow or
the percentage of

<CLAIMS>
A flowmeter which utilizes a constriction (3)
mounted in a main-conduit section (2a) of a main conduit, a

measuring conduit (4) which is connected in parallel across
the constriction and through which a by-pass flow (dQ) is

caused to pass from the main flow in the main-conduit
section by the pressure difference across the constriction

(3), a by-pass flowmeter (5) connected to the measuring
conduit (4), and an electronic signal converter (6") which

is adapted to convert a signal delivered from the by-pass Flowmeter
(5) to a signal which corresponds to the total flow

through the main conduit, 
characterized
 in that the
constriction (3) also comprises a movable conical body (11)

in the main-conduit section (2a) which is arranged to
produce an increasing throughflow area (3) in response

to an increasing pressure difference across the constriction
(3), whereby, in the case of a large flow, an increasing

instant flow through the main conduit (2) will result
in a smaller increase in the instant by-pass flow through

the measuring conduit than a proportional increase corresponding
to said instant main-flow; and in that the flowmeter

includes a compensating device (6") in the form of an
electronic signal converter which functions to compensate

the obtained instant output signal in response to an occurrent
discrepancy in the proportionality to the total flow

through the main conduit (2).
A flowmeter according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the conical body (11) has, or essentially has, a
truncated conical configuration, with the cone apex facing

in a direction towards the flow direction in the main
conduit (2) and in which the conical body is movable in

relation to a fixed constriction (3).
A flowmeter according to claim 1, 
characteterized
 
by a spring device (12) which functions

to urge the conical body (11) in a direction towards
the constriction (3).
A flowmeter according to Claim 3, 
characterized

in that the force exerted by the spring
device is adapted to a selected maximum flow through

the main conduit.
A flowmeter according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the electronic signal converter
(6') is intended, via a calibration, to assign a

value to each flow through the measuring conduit which
corresponds to the instant total flow through the main

conduit.
A flowmeter according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that the flowmeter has a selected
dynamic of above 1000:1.
