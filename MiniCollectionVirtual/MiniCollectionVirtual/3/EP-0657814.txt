<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a redundancy circuitry for
a semiconductor memory device.In the manufacture of semiconductor memories defects are
frequently encountered that afflict a limited number of memory
elements in the memory matrix. The reason for the high
probability of defects of this type resides in that in a
semiconductor memory device the greatest part of the chip area
is occupied by the memory matrix; moreover, it is in the memory
matrix, and not in the peripheral circuitry, that the
manufacturing process characteristics are usually pushed to
limits.In order to avoid that the presence of a limited number of
defective memory elements on many millions forces the rejection
of the entire chip, and therefore to increase the manufacturing
process yield, the technique is known of providing for the
manufacture of a certain number of additional memory elements,
commonly called "redundancy memory elements", to be used as a
replacement of those elements that, during testing of the
memory device, prove defective; the selection circuits, with
which the integrated component must necessarily be provided,
and which allow the abovementioned functional replacement of a
defective memory element with a redundancy memory element are
indicated as a whole with the name of "redundancy circuitry",
while the set of redundancy memory elements and circuitry is
defined for short as "redundancy".The redundancy circuitry comprises programmable
non-volatile memory registers suitable to store those address
configurations corresponding to the defective memory elements 
such registers are programmed once and for all during the
memory device testing, and must retain the information stored
therein even in absence of the power supply.In practical implementations of redundancy, both rows
("word lines") and columns ("bit lines") of redundancy memory
elements are provided in the memory matrix; each redundancy
word line or bit line is associated to a respective
non-volatile memory register, wherein the address of a
defective word line or bit line is stored so that, whenever the
defective word line or bit line is addressed, the corresponding
redundancy word line or bit line is selected. This implies that
each non-volatile memory register must be made up of a number
of programmable memory cells at least equal to the number of
bits in the row address bus, if the register is associated to a
redundancy word line, or in the column address bus, if the
register is instead associated to a redundancy bit line. Each
