<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a copolymer useful as a pour point depressant for 
hydrocarbon lubricating oils, and a method of making such copolymer. The 

copolymer comprises from about 15 mole percent to about 67 mole percent 
comonomeric units derived from one or more (C₈-C₁₅) alkyl (meth)acrylate 

monomer, from about 3 mole percent to about 40 mole percent comonomeric 
units derived from one or more (C₁₆-C₂₄) alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer, and 

from greater than 30 mole percent to about 65 mole percent comonomeric units 
derived from one or more (C₁-C₄)alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with certain alkyl (meth)acrylate
copolymers and their use as additives for lowering the pour point of hydrocarbon
lubricating oils.Lubricating base oils, e.g., commercial petroleum distillate oils,
commonly contain paraffinic hydrocarbons that crystallize upon cooling thereby
significantly increasing the viscosity of the oil. At a sufficiently low temperature, the
crystalline wax structure ultimately causes gelation of the base oil. The low
temperature fluidity of petroleum distillate oils can be improved by dewaxing and
such oils are typically dewaxed to a pour point, i.e., the lowest temperature at which
the oil remains fluid, of about -15°C. Further lowering of the pour point is typically
achieved by the use of a pour point lowering additive, i.e., a "pour point depressant",
that further lowers the pour point of the dewaxed oil, typically down to about -30°C.The composition of petroleum distillate oils is variable and the relationship
between base oil composition and the composition of those additives effective in
lowering the pour point of any particular base oil is often poorly characterized. It is,
therefore, not always possible to reliably prescribe a particular pour point depressant
composition for effectively treating a particular base oil, i.e., treatment of any
particular oil with pour point depressant remains, to a large extent, an empirical
undertaking.Poly(alkyl methacrylate) pour point depressants comprising higher alkyl esters,
e.g., those including 12 or more carbon atoms per alkyl group, are known. It is
believed that the elongated paraffin-like alkyl portions of such pour point depressants
are incorporated into the growing paraffin crystals, thereby inhibiting further crystal
growth and preventing formation of an extensive interlocking paraffin crystal
structure. In US-A-4,867,894, Pennewiss et al disclose a poly(alkyl methacrylate) pour
point depressant wherein from 10 to 30, preferably 10 to 20, mole percent methyl
methacrylate is copolymerized with alkylmethacrylate monomers having relatively
long, i.e., C16 and higher, alkyl groups to form a pour point depressant additive.
Pennewiss et al teach that such an additive has a lower cost due to substitution of
relatively low cost methyl methacrylate for a portion of relatively high cost higher
alkyl esters and that, within the disclosed ranges of methyl methacrylate mole percent,
such a substitution does not diminish the effectiveness of the additive as a pour point
depressant.WO 89/01507 discloses
