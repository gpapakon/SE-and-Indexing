<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an angular velocity 
sensor comprising a tuning fork vibrator which exerts 

tuning fork vibration by receiving a driving input and 
which generates a torque around the axis of a tuning fork 

owing to Coriolis force by undergoing a rotational action 
around the center of the tuning fork, and a detection 

torsional vibrator which exerts torsional vibration owing 
to the torque generated by the tuning fork vibrator, 

whereby the angular velocity sensor detects a rotational 
angular velocity around the axis of the tuning fork based 

upon the magnitude of the vibration of the detection 
torsional vibrator, said angular velocity sensor further 

comprising a buffer torsional vibrator provided at least 
singly
 outside said detection torsional vibrator for 
moderating external transmission energy loss of the 

torsional vibrator of said detection torsional vibrator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an angular velocity 
sensor for detecting the angular velocity of a rotator. Referring to FIGs.1 and 2, there are illustrated 
general arrangements of the prior art velocity sensors. A first prior art example illustrated in FIG.1 
includes driving piezoelectric elements 2a, 2b disposed on 
outer side surfaces of plate vibrators 1a, 1b of a tuning 
fork vibrator 1, a detector 3 protruded on the bottom lc 
of the tuning fork vibrator 1, and angular velocity 
detector means (not shown), each comprising a magnet and an 
electrode, etc., disposed on opposite side surfaces of the 
detetor 3. The bottom lc is coupled with a fixed plate 1e 
through a column (tuning fork shaft) 1d. With such an angular velocity sensor an excitation 
signal is applied to the driving piezoelectric elements 2a, 
2b to cause the plate vibrators 1a, 1b to vibrate with the 
same magnitude oppositely to each other as indicated by 
arrows V1, V2 in the figure. In this situation, once the 
tuning fork vibrator 1 is rotated counterclockwise around 
an axis Z, oppositely directed inertia forces (Coriolis  
 
forces) F1, F2 are generated perpendicularly to the 
direction of the vibration and perpendicularly to a 
rotation axis (Z axis). A torque due to the oppositely 
directed Coriolis forces F1, F2 is applied on the tuning 
fork vibrator 1 whereby the vibrator 1 exerts torsional 
vibration, the magnitude of the amplitude of which 
torsional vibration is detected by detector means (not 
shown) and is outputted as an angular velocity signal. A 
change in the amplitude of the torsional vibration of the 
tuning fork vibrator 1 is detected as a change in 
electrostatic capacity between a detector electrode 
provided in the detector means and another electrode 
disposed oppositely to the former. The first prior art example described above has, 
however, difficulties that microprocessing is unlikely to 
be done followed by unsatisfactory detection accuracy and 
that it is large-sized. In contrast, another prior art 
example illustrated in FIG. 2 is contemplated to solve the 
difficulties with the first prior art example and is 
described in a reference (PROCEEDINGS FOR MICROELECTRO 
MECHANICAL SYSTEMS Feb. 7-10, 1993), etc. An angular 
velocity sensor in the same figure is formed using a 
semiconductor substrate such as a silicon substrate with 
the aid of a semiconductor microprocessing technique. A 
fixed electrode 5 is formed at the center on a substrate  
 
25, and vibration plates 7, 8 of a tuning fork
