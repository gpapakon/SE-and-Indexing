<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and
method for automatically measuring the weights and/or
relative proportions of the size ranges of particles
in particulate mixtures.Particle size analyses, that is, measurements
of the relative proportions by weight of particles
of a given sample in different size (diameter)
ranges, are widely used in process control and optimization.
The size range of a given fraction may be
characterized, for example, as being between 2.54 and 12.7 mm (0.01
and 0.05 inch), which means that the particles in that
range are retained on a screen having openings smaller
than 2.54 mm (0.01 inch) but pass through a sieve having openings
larger than 12.7 mm (0.05 inch). Such analyses are frequently
performed with sieves (screens) of progressively
finer mesh sizes, such as the well-known U.S.
Standard testing sieves. The sample to be analyzed is
placed on the coarsest sieve at the top of a stack of
sieves and the entire stack is shaken, particles of 
different size ranges being retained on different
sieves. The sieves are then removed one by one from
the stack and the fractions on them are emptied onto a
scale and weighed to determine the proportion of the
fraction relative to the total sample weight. If the
analysis is carried out manually, as is often done,
the procedure is slow and labor intensive. A mechanical
shaking device such as the "Ro-tap" shaker made
by W.S. Tyler, Inc., of Mentor, Ohio, can be used to
apply standardized shaking schedules to the stack of
sieves, but nevertheless each sieve must be taken
manually from the stack, the retained fraction emptied
from it and weighed, and the emptied sieves restacked
in proper sequence for the next analysis.In many laboratories and manufacturing
processes it is necessary to make particle size range
analyses frequently and routinely. It may, for
example, be desirable to monitor the proportion of
"fines" (particles below some predetermined minimum
size), or the proportion of coarse "overs"; or the
relative distribution among size ranges may be important
for process control. Because manual particle
size range analyses are time consuming, in those
applications where they must be performed frequently
and routinely there exists a need for an automatic
particle size analyzer which will separate the various
size range fractions, and empty and weigh them 
individually with no or minimal manual control and
manipulation.Any automatic particle size analysis using a
graduated set of sieves necessarily requires separately
weighing the particles
