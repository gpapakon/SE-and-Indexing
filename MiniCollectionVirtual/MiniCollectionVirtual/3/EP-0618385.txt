<CLAIMS>
A connection element (1) for two parts (27, 28) for decoupling 
of sound, with a gasket (29) inserted in between, especially 

for the fastening of a cylinder head cover to a cylinder 
head, with a screw (2) having a head (4) or a center collar 

(37), which has a non-circular surface (5) for the fitting of a 
spanner, a shaft (8) with a threaded section (10, 11), and a 

support area (14) which extends radially and rests upon a 
counter area, especially on the cylinder head, in the end-mounted 

position, and with a sound insulating sleeve-like formed 
body (3) made of an elastomer material, where the formed body 

(3) is held to the screw (2) in the premounted state of the 
connection element (1) preferably by a stop (24) and a counter-stop 

(25) with limited axial movement, but so that it cannot be 
lost, 
wherein
 the formed body (3) has such an axial length that 
it protrudes the first part (27) in the direction of the gasket 

(29) with a continuation (19) provided thereon in the state in 
which it is mounted in the first part (27), that the continuation 

(19) of the formed body (3) has a recess (20) for mounting 
the gasket (29) so that it cannot be lost, and that at least one 

friction area pairing (22) is provided between the formed body 
(3) and the screw (2), which holds and aligns the screw (2) in 

every position by the lift (26) of the limited axial movement. 
The connection element of claim 1, 
wherein
 the friction area 
pairing (22) has a certain axial extension for the compliant 

alignment of the axis (33) of the screw (2) and for holding it 
in every position.  

 
The connection element of claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 a second 
friction area pairing (40
) is provided between the formed body 
(3) and the screw (2). 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 
the screw (2) has an upset swelling (13), which on the one hand 

is a part of the friction area pairing (22 or 40) and which on 
the other hand forms the support area (14) for the reproducible 

end-mounted position, approximately in the middle region of its 
shaft (8). 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 
the screw (2) has shoulder forming a step, which forms the 

support area (14), approximately in the middle region of its 
shaft (8). 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 5, 
wherein
 
the lift (26) of the limited axial movement between the screw 

(2) and the formed body (3) is formed to be larger than the 
screw-in length of the screw (2). 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 
the recess (20) on the formed body (3) is a surrounding groove 

radially open towards the outside on the outer perimeter of the 
continuation (19), into which the gasket (29), preferably by a 

metal ring (32) integrated therein, can be inserted. 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 
the head (4) or the center collar (37) of the screw (2) has an 

enlarged outer diameter as compared to the diameter of the shaft 
(8) and therefore an enlarged bearing area (6) for the compression 

of the formed body (3).  
 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 
the friction area pairing (22) or the friction area pairings 

(22, 40) have a coating (41), which is provided on the inner 
circumference of the formed body (3) and/or on the outer 

circumference of the shaft (8) of the screw (2). 
The connection element of one of the claims 1 to 9, 
wherein
 
a turned groove (15) is provided between the part (10) of the 

shaft (8) having the thread (11) and the threadless part (9) of 
the shaft (8) of the screw (2).
