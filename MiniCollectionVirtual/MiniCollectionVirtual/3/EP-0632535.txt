<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector includes a connector housing 
(21) having a drain hole (21b) formed deep in it. A vacuum 

pump (32) is connected to the drain hole (21b) through a 
suction pipe (31). The suction pipe (31) is connected to a 

water trap (33). A control unit (41) controls the vacuum 
pump (32) on the basis of the state of a mode selecting 

switch (42) and the result of detection by a reed switch 
(25) detecting the state of a lid (23) closing and opening 

an opening (21a) of the connector housing (21). In mode A, 
the vacuum pump (32) is actuated to suck in water in the 

connector housing (21) with air while the lid (23) is open. 
In mode B, the vacuum pump (32) is actuated both when the 

lid (23) is opened and when the lid (23) is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combination of an electrical
connector of the type wherein terminals are enclosed
deep in a connector housing having a depressed portion and
a counterpart connector to be inserted into the depressed
portion so that the terminals are mated with those of the
counterpart connector respectively, and more particularly
to such a combination of electrical connector and counterpart
connector suitable for use in places, such as the outdoors,
where the connector is subjected to rain or other
water drops.The prior art has provided various types of electrical
connectors suitable for use in places, such as the outdoors,
where the connectors are subjected to rain drops.
One of such connectors includes a waterproof cap mounted to
close and open an opening of a connector housing. The waterproof
cap is attached to the connector housing to close
its opening when the connector is not used while the cap is
detached from the connector housing so that the connector
is mated with a counterpart connector when the connector is
used. In the case where the rain drops have invaded the
connector housing when the connectors are intermated, the
rain drops are wiped away with cloth or the like and then
the connectors are intermated.In the above-described conventional connector, the rain
drops needs to be wiped away with the cloth when invading
the connector housing in the case where the waterproof cap
is detached from the connector housing. However, since terminals
are provided in the connector housing, it is difficult
to wipe the rain drops away with the cloth. Furthermore,
there is a possibility that other rain drops may invade
the connector housing while the rain drops are being
wiped away. The wiping work is thus inefficient. JP-U-4-124 774, from which the present invention starts
from, shows an electrical connector suitable for use in
e.g. outdoors. There is also provided a waterproof cap
mounted to close and open an opening of a connector housing.
The waterproof cap is attached to the connector housing
to close its opening when the connector is not used
while the cap is detached from the connector housing so
that the connector is mated with a counterpart connector
when the connector is used. In addition, there is provided
a drain hole deep inside the connector housing, so that
water drops which have invaded the connector housing can
flow to the outside.An object of the present invention is to
provide an electrical connector wherein the water having
invaded the connector housing can be efficiently

<CLAIMS>
A combination of an electrical connector (20) which
is to be mated with a counterpart connector (50), said connector

(20) comprising:

a connector housing (21) having a depressed portion
into which said counterpart connector (50) is inserted

through an opening (21a);
terminals disposed deep in said connector housing (21)
so as to be connected to terminals of said counterpart connector

(50) respectively; and
a lid (23) provided to close and open said opening
(21a) of said connector housing (21), wherein
means are provided for directing water from the inside
of said connector housing (21) to the outside thereof,

   
characterized by
:

a suction mechanism (30) communicating with the interior
of said connector housing (21) and constituting said

water directing means;
timer means operated at least for a predetermined period
of time when said suction mechanism (30) is actuated;
a sensor (25) for detecting closure and opening of
said lid (23); and
control means (41) for controlling said suction mechanism
(30) on the basis of the result of detection by said

sensor (25).
The combination according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 said control means (41) actuates said suction
mechanism (41) on the basis of the result of detection by

said sensor (25) when said lid (23) has been opened and
stops said suction mechanism (30) when said lid (23) has

been closed. 
The combination according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 said control means (41) controls said suction
mechanism (30) so that said suction mechanism (30) is further

actuated for a predetermined period of time after said
lid (23) has been closed and so that said suction mechanism

(30) is stopped upon lapse of the predetermined time period.
The combination according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 said control means (41) actuates said suction
mechanism (30) for a predetermined period of time on the

basis of the results of detection by said sensor (25) both
