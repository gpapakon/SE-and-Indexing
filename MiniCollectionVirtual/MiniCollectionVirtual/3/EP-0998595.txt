<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved electrolytic cell for the production of chlorine and sodium or lithium from fused chloride electrolytes. In one embodiment, the cell contains a product collector with a compartment (9) for collecting the chlorine from each anode and a compartment (8) for collecting the sodium or lithium from the cathode(s), the collector comprising a hydraulically permeable collection assembly extending below the top level of the cathode and containing impact surfaces which coalesce a portion of the sodium or lithium droplets in the electrolyte. In a second embodiment, the cell contains a diaphragm assembly between the anode and cathode comprising two adjacent hydraulically permeable structures, each hydraulically permeable structure containing a plurality of impact surfaces and openings angled upwards away from the nearest section of the adjacent hydraulically permeable structure. In a third embodiment, the cell contains graphite anode(s) wherein at least 10 % of the average anode cross-sectional area is replaced with a material with lower heat conductivity than graphite in that portion of the anode where it enters the cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrolytic cell for the electrolysis of
fused alkali chloride salts for the production of alkali metals such as sodium and
lithium.Electrolytic cells for the electrolysis of fused alkali chloride salts
are used widely in industry to produce alkali metals such as sodium and lithium
that are difficult to reduce from their compounds to a metallic state. A major cost
for operating these cells is the cost of electric power. Since the early 1970s
energy costs, including electric energy, have increased sharply. Development of
more energy-efficient electrolysis processes, therefore, has become increasingly
important during recent years.The overall electric power requirements of the electrolytic
processes are the total of the power requirements for the key operating elements in
an electrolytic cell and the requirements for the ancillary operations. Although
these ancillary operations are significant, the discussion below will focus only on
the key elements involved in the electrolysis step, and in particular, the
electrolysis of sodium and lithium.The electrolytic recovery of sodium or lithium metals is typically
carried out via non-aqueous molten chloride salt electrolysis. Except for the
electrolyte composition and operating temperature, the electrolysis of sodium and
lithium is very similar, and both processes are carried out in very similar
equipment. While the discussion below will concentrate on sodium manufacture,
it is to be understood that the features relating to cell design and operation also
apply to lithium manufacture.Most industrial installations for molten salt electrolysis of sodium
have chosen the Downs cell design to carry out the process, originally disclosed in
U.S. Pat. No. 1,501,756. A detailed description of this cell is given in Ullmann's 
Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. A24, VCH
Verlagsgesellschaft, Germany, pp. 284-288 (1993). A typical industrial cell of
this type is shown in FIGURE 1. The electrolyte typically used is a mixture of
sodium and calcium chlorides, or a mixture of sodium, calcium and barium
chlorides, a mixture of salts being used to lower the melt temperature. An
operating temperature of about 600 degrees C is ordinarily employed.A modem Downs cell typically contains four graphite carbon
anodes and, concentrically surrounding each of them, cylindrical steel cathodes.
In operation, sodium is deposited on the inside surface of the steel cathodes and
chlorine gas is liberated at the graphite anodes. Typically, in a cell
