Air is separated in a cryogenic air separation process 
in which (i) at least a portion of a nitrogen-rich liquid 

(410) from a column system having high and low pressure 
columns (5,6) is boosted in pressure (13) before being 

vaporized (2) and delivered as a product (400); (ii) at 
least a portion (120) of the feed air (100) is at least 

partially condensed in indirect heat exchange (2) with the 
boosted pressure, nitrogen-rich stream; and (iii) a p
ortion 
of the liquid nitrogen condensed from the vapor nitrogen

<DESCRIPTION>
The process of the present invention relates to a process and an apparatus for the production of pressurized
oxygen and nitrogen products by the cryogenic distillation of air.There are numerous situations for which both pressurized oxygen and pressurized nitrogen are required. Since
equipment cost and power cost are the important aspects of the cost of production, an objective of the present invention
is to reduce the equipment or power cost, or both, for a process to produce both pressurized oxygen and nitrogen
products.US-A-5148680 (published 22nd September 1992; corresponding to EP-A-0464630 published 8th January 1992)
discloses a process and apparatus for cryogenic air separation using a double column distillation system in which liquid
oxygen produced in the low pressure column is pressurized and then used to condense a feed air portion. The condensed
feed air portion and all other feed air portions are fed to the high pressure column. Liquified nitrogen product
from the high pressure column also is pressurized and then used to condense the feed air portion. Top reflux to the
low pressure column is provided by an impure liquid nitrogen stream from an intermediate location of the high pressure
column or by liquified nitrogen product from the high pressure column. The preambles of the independent claims are
based on US-A-5148680.GB-A-2251931 (published 22nd July 1992) also discloses a process and apparatus for cryogenic air separation
using a double column distillation system in which liquid oxygen produced in the low pressure column is pressurized
and then used to condense a pressurized feed air portion. At least part of the condensed feed air portion is fed to an
intermediate location of the low pressure column. Top reflux to the low pressure column is provided by liquified nitrogen
product from the high pressure column.In the only exemplified embodiment (Figure 2) of GB-A-2251931, all the nitrogen product from the high pressure
column is fed to the low pressure column as top reflux.EP-A-0504029 (published 16th September 1992) also discloses a process and apparatus for cryogenic air separation
using a double column distillation system in which liquid oxygen produced in the low pressure column is pressurized
and then used to condense a pressurized feed air portion. At least part of the condensed feed air portion is
fed to an intermediate location of the low pressure column. Top reflux to the low pressure column is provided by liquid
nitrogen product from the high pressure column.In one exemplified
