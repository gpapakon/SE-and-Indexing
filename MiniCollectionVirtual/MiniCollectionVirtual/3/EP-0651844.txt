<ABSTRACT>
A mounting device (12) for a building surface (14). The mounting device (12) includes a mounting body (24) having a slot (26) extending therethrough. This slot (26) may be positioned over/about a standing seam (14) on a metal roof/sidewall (20) and be appropriately secured thereto, such as by the use of blunt-nosed screws which engage the seam material. The mounting device (12) also includes at least one mounting cavity (36) which is adapted to receive an attachment (18), such as a snow retention device (18) or an interconnector which then engages the attachment (e.g., a frame structure, sign).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
an apparatus for controlling movement of ice and/or
snow along a predetermined area of a sloping surface.With the increased use of sheet metal panels in
building construction, there has been an increased need to
address ways in which various building attachments can be
interconnected with a metal panel surface.
In various climates it may be desirable to position a snow
retention device on a metal roof to control/inhibit/impede
the movement of snow and/or ice down the pitch of the roof. Sliding snow and/or ice from roofs can be hazardous to
people, the surrounding landscape, property, and building
components. For example, snow or ice sliding from a roof
above an entryway may injure passers-by. Similarly,
falling snow or ice can do damage to landscape features,
such as shrubs, and property or building components,
including automobiles or lower roofing portions. In
addition, sliding snow or ice can shear off antennas,
gutters or other components attached to a building roof or
wall, thereby potentially causing a leak. The problem of
sliding snow or ice is particularly experienced in
connection with metal roofs, including raised seam roofs
(e.g., standing seam), where there is relatively little
friction between the roof and the snow or ice. As used
herein, the term "raised seam roofs" includes roofs formed
by a series of panels interconnected to define
longitudinal, raised portions. It may therefore be
desirable to provide a guard suitable for controlling
movement of snow and/or ice across/along selected areas of
such metal roofs.Snow guard devices were initially developed for use on
tile and shingle roofs. In one type of configuration for
use on such roofs, an L-shaped brace has one leg which is
fastened to the roof and another leg which projects
upwardly from the roof. The fastening leg is typically
nailed or screwed into the roof beneath a shingle or tile.
By positioning and attaching a plurality of these braces to
the roof in substantially linear fashion, linear bars may 
be positioned within/through one or more receiving areas of
the respective upwardly projecting legs to provide a fence-like
configuration for snow and/or ice retention. U.S.
Patent Nos. 97,316 to Rogers, issued November 30, 1869,
106,580 to Hathorn, issued August 23, 1870, 250,580 to
Rogers, issued December 6, 1881, and 756,884 to Parry,
issued April 12, 1904, are generally representative of this
type of device.A device which employs a similar structure to the
