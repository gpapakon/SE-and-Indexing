<ABSTRACT>
A seal (1) for the seat of a rotary shaft (3), 
including a metal support (10); an elastomeric element 

(11) cured on to the support and having at least one 
annular sealing lip (12); and a sealing lip protection 

and centering element consisting of a dust ring (16) 
interference fittable to the shaft (3) so as to rotate, 

in use, angularly integral with it, and housed idly 
inside an annular channel seat (20) formed integral with 

the support (10) and radially and axially outwards of 
the seat in relation to the sealing lip (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seal for rotary 
shaft seats, fittable to rotary shafts for effecting a 
low-friction sliding seal, and featuring, for the 
sealing portion, a centering and protection element 
forming an integral part of the seal itself. Rotary shaft seals generally comprise a metal 
support for fitment inside the shaft seat; and an 
elastomeric element cured on to the support and having 
one or more annular sealing lips designed, with a small 
amount of interference, to mate with and effect a 
sliding seal on the outer lateral surface of the shaft, 
for which purpose the lip may present pressure elements 
such as garter springs or similar. When seating the seal and/or shaft, relative axial 
slide is incurred between the seal and shaft, which, 
particularly if they are not perfectly centered, may 
cause irreparable damage to the sealing lip, thus 
impairing the efficiency or, at any rate, reducing the 
working life of the seal. Moreover, any off-centering  
 
between the seal and shaft may result in severe in-service 
friction and localized leakage. To overcome the 
above drawbacks, seals are known to be fitted with 
protection and centering elements consisting of 
disposable rigid sleeves, which are fitted to the sealing 
lip/s and eliminated using special tools during assembly. The above solution, however, presents several 
drawbacks. By virtue of not forming part of the seal, the 
protective sleeve must be preassembled, thus increasing 
assembly cost; being a disposable element, the sleeve not 
only increases the unit cost of the seal, but also 
creates disposal problems at the seal-shaft assembly 
stage; the assembly operation itself requires the use of 
special tools; and, last but not least, the solution 
itself is not always feasible, particularly when space is 
limited. An alternative solution is known from EP-A-0289148, 
which shows a seal according to the features of the preamble of claim 1. This known arrangement appears however to be bulky and difficult to assemble. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a rotary shaft seal featuring a sealing lip protection 
element designed to overcome the aforementioned 
drawbacks, and which in particular, by virtue of forming 
an integral part of the seal, may be applied cheaply and 
effectively in all cases. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a seal for the seat of a rotary shaft, the seal 
comprising a metal support; an elastomeric element cured  
 
on to the support and having at least one annular

<CLAIMS>
A seal (1) for the seat (2) of a rotary shaft 
(3), the seal comprising a metal support (10); an 

elastomeric element (11) cured on to the support (10) and 
having at least one annular sealing lip (12); and an 

element (16) for protecting and centering the sealing lip 
(12); said protection and centering element consisting of 

a dust ring (16) forming an integral part of the seal 
and interference fittable to the shaft (3) so as to 

rotate, in use, angularly integral therewith; said ring 
(16) being housed idly and in axially slack manner inside 

an annular channel seat (20) formed integral with the 
support (10) and engaged by the peripherally outer edge 

(21) of the ring (16); said channel seat (20) being 
located axially outwards in relation to the sealing lip 

(12) in the insertion direction of the seal (1) inside 
the shaft seat (2);
characterized in that
 said support (10) is in the form 
of a one-piece cup-shaped body (31), and comprises a 

radially extending first flange portion (32) defining the 
end wall of the cup-shaped body and provided with said 

elastomeric element (11) axially inwards in the insertion 
direction inside the shaft seat (2); a sleeve portion 

(33) projecting axially in the insertion direction inside 
the shaft seat (2), and perpendicular to said first 

flange portion (32); and an axially extending second  
 

flange portion (34) located radially outwards in relation 
to the sleeve portion (33), and bent 180Â° on to the 

sleeve portion (33) so as to define with it a lateral 
wall (38) of the cup-shaped body (31), for fitment to the 

shaft seat (2); and
in that
 said channel seat (20) for the dust ring (16) 
is defined by the free edge (35) of said second flange 

portion (34), wherein said free edge is L-shaped and 
located axially outwrds in relation to the said first 

flange portion (32) in the insertion direction of the 
seal. 
A seal (1) as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that said sealing lip (12) defines a shaft 

mating and insertion hole (14) larger in diameter than a 
corresponding shaft mating and insertion hole (18) 

defined radially inwards by said dust ring (16). 
A seal (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that said elastomeric element 

(11) extends over the same side of all three said 
portions (32, 33, 34) of the support (10), so that the 

lateral wall (38) of the cup-shaped body (31) defined by 
the support (10) is covered with the elastomeric element 

(11) on both the inside and outside of the cup-shaped 
body (31). 
A seal (1) as claimed in one of the foregoing 
Claims, characterized by the fact that said dust ring 

(16) comprises a first radially-inner annular portion  
 

(41) made of elastomeric material for mating with the 
shaft (3); and a second radially-outer portion (42; 50) 

made of relatively rigid material, preferably synthetic 
plastic. 
A seal (1) as claimed in Claim 4, characterized 
by the fact that the face (44; 54) of the dust ring (16) 

facing the opposite way to the insertion direction of the 
seal inside the shaft seat (2) presents coils (45) for 

spinning off, in use, any pollutant substances.
