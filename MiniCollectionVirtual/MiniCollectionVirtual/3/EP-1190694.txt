<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is described for the coating of a human body with a tanning
composition, such as a sunless tanning composition, wherein an arm with a plurality of

nozzles thereon traverses within a booth to spray coat a body in the booth. The spray
nozzles are oriented to avoid opposing air flows and excessive air flows which cause

inefficient and uneven, dripping or streaking in the deposition of tanning composition
on the skin. In another aspect, the apparatus provides for a foot rinser to rinse the feet

of a user while the apparatus applies a sunless tanning composition to the user to avoid
overly darkening the user's feet. In yet another aspect, the apparatus provides for a

sanitation system to wash-down the spray booth between successive uses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the application of compositions to a
person's skin, and more particularly, for example, to an apparatus adapted for use in a
booth for the uniform spray application of artificial tanning compositions to the human
body.The cosmetic effect of tanned skin has long been a desired goal for many
people. This desire has led to the development of a large and varied industry
supplying compositions and devices to facilitate natural or UV radiation induced
tanning of the skin. Another market has developed for compositions to more rapidly
provide the visual effect of tanned skin without sun exposure. In addition to the
development of the multitude of sun tanning, sun screening and artificial tanning and
bronzing lotions, creams and oils now available, various applicator devices for the
different compositions have been devised, ranging from simple squeeze bottles and
pump sprays, to hand-held spray canisters similar to pump-style pesticide spray
canisters, to elaborate spray rooms that generate mists of suntan lotions or artificial
tanning compositions for application to a user standing in the room.These various applicator devices include U.S. Patent No. 1,982,509 to Frank
showing a belt-driven carriage apparatus in a vertically oriented cabinet designed to
carry, among several alternatives, a compressed air sprayer head and one or more
reservoirs for liquid or powder compositions to be spray applied through the sprayer
head to all or part of the body of a user standing in front of the apparatus. The '509
patent does not disclose the spray application of tanning compositions, and the single
spray nozzle would necessarily result in an uneven application in overlap areas as the
user turns for sequential sprayer passes, and/or missed areas under the arms or on the
insides of the arms and legs. The belt driven carriage of the '509 patent is raised and
lowered along a guide pole in the cabinet with the start and stop positions for the 
carriage and the activation of the sprayer apparatus being coordinated by a
complicated set of electromechanical linkages and trip-switches.U.S. Patents 5,460,192 and 5,664,593, both to McClain, describe variations of
an apparatus to coat a user's body up to the neck with suntan lotion or sunscreen. Both
variations provide for a cylindrical enclosure in which the user stands with head and
neck protruding through a hole in the top of the enclosure. The apparatus of the '192
patent provides for three liquid spray nozzles directed at the shoulder
