<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a floating calliper (20) for a disc brake, the disc brake having a pad pressure surface (21) which lies opposite the application device (3) of the disc brake and, during braking, acts on the rear side of the brake shoe (11) situated on this side in such a way that it is pressed against the brake disc. In order to be able to lower the production costs for the pad pressure surface (21) the proposal is to provide the pad pressure surface with a surface profile, the effective contact area of which with the rear side of the brake shoe is such that, at the maximum brake pressure, the unit surface pressure which arises leads to essentially complete contact of the pad pressure surface with the rear side of the brake shoe (11). A suitable method for the production of a profile of this kind is an embossing process but the profile can also be formed during the casting of the floating calliper (20).
