<ABSTRACT>
The packaging for a catheter (1, 2, 3) comprises a 
flat air tight support member (4) and a cover member 

(5) formed of an air tight and flexible sheet adhered 
by its periphery (6) on the support member (4). A vacuum 

is exerted between the support member (4) and the cover 
member (5) by connection of a duct (7) to a vacuum 

pump, and the duct (7) is then sealed. The cover member 
thus takes the relief of the shapes of the catheter 

whatever they are.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging holding a product
during storage and transit under controlled
environmental conditions, comprising a support member
having a rigid portion, the product located on said
rigid portion, and a cover member sealed on the support
member to maintain the controlled environmental
conditions, said cover member being applied by pressure
on the product and against the support member for
housing the product and for securing it to the support
member.Packagings are known that are made for example to
protect sterile medical appliances against the risk of
becoming unsterile and contaminated and to maintain the
shapes of the appliance during storage and transit. They
are generally made to whenever possible facilitate the
packaging procedure as well as the unpacking of the
medical appliance.In some known packagings of this kind, the cover member
is a moulded plastic blister, the pressed-out or
outwardly projecting portion of which corresponds to the
shapes of the relief of the packaged product located on
the support member. Upon its enclosing into the
packaging, the medical appliance must be precisely and
carefully introduced into the moulding of the blister
before sealing thereof onto the support member, and
there is therefore some risk to damage delicate portions
of the medical appliance, such as for instance preshaped
tips of stems of catheters. Upon extraction of the
medical appliance from the packaging, the blister must
he unsealed and separated from the support member up to
the level of a portion of the medical appliance which
can be grasped by the doctor, and the blister can be
then completely separated from the support member so
that the doctor may fully extract the medical appliance. This is delicate a job because due to the hollow shape
of the blister moulding there can be some creasing or
cuts of the blister or even some retention in the
blister which can damage the medical appliance at the
place where it is still in the blister. Apart of this
problem, that kind of packaging is by no means
universally usable because any blister moulding is
specific to one shape and there is needed as many
blister mouldings as there may be different shapes for
the medical appliance.US Patent NÂ° 5,105,942 describes a blister packaging
which comprises, in the pressed-out portion
corresponding to the delicate pre-shaped stem of the
medical appliance, a corrugated profile the purpose of
which is to create some flexibility in the blister to
avoid the risk of having that package portion creasing
or

A packaging holding a product (1-3)
during storage and transit under controlled environmental

conditions, comprising a support member (4, 9-10,
90-10, 130) having a rigid portion (4, 9, 40, 90) supporting

the product and a cover member (5, 50, 12,
121) sealed on the support member to maintain the controlled

conditions, said cover member being applied
on the product and against the support member

for housing the product and for securing
it to the support member, whereby the

cover member (5, 50, 12, 121) comprises a flexible
wall (5, 50, 120, 122) that can be put out of shape,

said wall securing the (1-3) to the
rigid portion (4, 9, 40, 90) of the support member

(4, 9-10, 90-10, 130) by means of the immediate application
of a pressure medium, and wherein the pressure of

the said pressure medium on the is
maintained by the sealing of the cover member on the

support member which maintains the controlled conditions,
whereby

sole breaking of the sealing that holds the pressure
medium releases the forces which are securing and maintaining

the in the packaging characterized in that the product
is a medical appliance and that

spring means (14) are located between the flexible wall (50) and the support member (9).
A packaging according to claim 1, wherein the pressure
medium that secures the medical appliance (1-3)

to the support member (4, 9, 90, 130) is isolated in
one single room of the packaging, whereby the cover

member (5, 50, 12, 121) and the support member (4,
9, 90, 130) form a pouch.
A packaging according to any of claims 1 and 2,
wherein the cover member is an inflated bag (12, 121)

a portion of which forms the flexible wall (120, 122)
that can be put out of shape. 
A packaging according to claim 3, wherein the bag
is made of a plurality of juxtaposed communicating

chambers.
A packaging according to any of claims 1 and 2, 
wherein the cover member (5, 50) and the support member

(4, 9) are air tight, wherein the cover member (5,
50) is a sheet forming the flexible wall that can be

put out of shape, and wherein the pressure medium
is a vacuum

exerted between said sheet and support member.
A packaging according to any preceding claim, wherein the spring
means (14) are compressed by the flexible wall

(50) as a result of the pressure medium.
A packaging according to any preceding claim,
wherein the spring means are made of folded tongues

(14).
A packaging according to claim 7, wherein the tongues
(14) are made of folded cardboard.
A packaging according to any preceding claim,
wherein the spring means (14) are held in place on

the support member (9) by the pressure of
the pressure medium.
A packaging according to any preceeding claim,
wherein the support member (9, 90) has a peripheral

rim (10) to facilitate stacking of the packaging.
A packaging according to any preceeding claim,
wherein the support member (130) is a gutter like U

shaped structure to facilitate stacking of the packaging.
A packaging according to any preceeding claim, 
wherein the elements isolating the pressure medium are

made of a metal foil.
