<ABSTRACT>
A silencer has a housing (1) and a silencer chamber (4) arranged inside the former and surrounded with sound-insulating material (5), and an exhaust inlet pipe (7) and exhaust outlet pipe (8), both passing through the housing (1) and extending into the interior of the silencer chamber (4). Their ends fix the position of the silencer chamber (4) relative to the housing (1). An additional fixing element (10) is also provided for the silencer chamber (4), which element at one end engages on an outer side of the silencer chamber and at the other on an inner side of the housing (1).

<CLAIMS>
A silencer, preferably for gaseous media, comprising a casing 
(1), a sound-absorption chamber (4) which is arranged in the interior of 

the casing (1) and which is surrounded by sound-absorption material (5), 
and an exhaust gas outlet pipe (8) and an exhaust gas intake pipe (7) 

respectively passing through the casing (1) and projecting into the 
interior of the sound-absorption chamber (4), and a fixing element (10) 

for determining the relative position of the sound-absorption chamber (4) 
relative to the casing (1), characterised in that the fixing element (10) 

is in the form of a plate with longitudinal sides (9, 11) of unequal 
lengths, wherein the longer longitudinal side (9) is fixedly connected to 

an end wall of the sound-absorption chamber (4) and the shorter 
longitudinal side (11) is fixedly connected to the inside of the casing 

(1). 
A silencer according to claim 1 characterised in that the plate 
(10) is provided integrally with the end wall of the sound-absorption 

chamber (4). 
A silencer according to claim 1 having a casing (1) which is 
formed by two half-shell portions (2, 3) which are connected together by 

folding along at least one of their longitudinal sides characterised in 
that the plate (10) extends between the two folded ends (12, 13) of the 

half-shell portions (2, 3). 
A silencer according to claim 1 characterised in that both the 
end wall of the sound-absorption chamber (4) and also the wall of the 

casing (1), which is opposite thereto, each have a respective groove 
whose width corresponds to the thickness of the plate (10) and whose 

lengths substantially correspond to the length of the longitudinal sides 
(9, 11) of the plate (10).
