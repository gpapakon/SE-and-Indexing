<ABSTRACT>
A K-filter (1) is the one attached to an apparatus for serial high-speed rotatography for photographing a specimen by use 
of X rays. The filter comprises two K-containers (5a and 5b) in which a space is defined for fluidly containing a fluid substance 

transmitting no radiation, and a radiation permeable region (2) formed between the two K-containers (5a and 5b). The K-containers 
(5a and 5b) are pivotally supported by a supporting member (1a) and are of an inversion type which allows the radiation 

permeable region sides of the K-containers to move. Therefore, when this apparatus is rotated at a high speed to more than 180°, 
it is possible to conduct filtering under any conditions such as an inclined posture, not the horizontal posture, under which potographing 

is started.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to filters
(which in the following description will be
often referred to as K-filters, the letter K having no
technical significance) for
serial high-speed rotatography and apparatus for the
serial high-speed rotatography. More particularly, this
invention relates to a filter and an apparatus for the
serial high-speed rotatography which are capable of
photographing radiographic images of an object speedily,
accurately and with high quality from every possible
angle without forming a dead angle, and hence are
suitable for providing useful and detailed information to
make a precision diagnosis immediately and determine a
therapeutic treatment plan without delay.Various photographic techniques using radiopaque or
radiation-impermeable contrast media have been proposed.
For instance, in the field of angiography using X-rays,
the direct-film method, X-ray cinefilm method, and
digital subtraction method are known.The proposed techniques are all based on a system in
which two-dimensional serial photographing from a fixed
angle is achieved with injection of an intravascular 
radiopaque contrast medium. Due to the fixed
photographing angle, this system is in many case unable
to make a correct diagnosis, e.g. of the extent and site
of a coronary stricture (focus responsible for the
disease) of the acute myocardial infarction based on a
single run of the serial photographing, and subsequently
take an appropriate therapeutic treatment, such as PTCA
(Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) without
delay. Particularly when the object to be examined is in
the dynamic state or in motion, such a fixed-position
photographing is almost unable to detect the condition of
a portion of the object opposite the view site.In order to obtain correct information about the
object, observation of additional images taken from many
different angles is inevitable. Such a multi-angle
observation, however, requires repeated photographing
entailing synchronous repeated injection of the contrast
medium with the resultant prolonged examination time and
increased medical radiation exposure.There have been proposed techniques related to the
serial rotation stereography in which a stereoscope is
used to observe an image as a stereograph from a desired
position. The proposed techniques include special two
trains of electronic circuits additionally provided to
display analog images or digital subtraction images with 
predetermined angular phases on two display units, e.g.,
television monitors (see,

be examined by use of X-rays, said filter (1) comprising two

containers (5a,5b) made of a material which is transparent to
the radiation for which the filter is used, each container

defining a space fluidly containing therein a radiopaque fluid
substance (4), and a radiotransparent region (2) formed between

said two containers, said containers being pivotally supported
by a supporting member such that

the radiotransparent-region sides of the containers are
allowed to move.
