<ABSTRACT>
A charging cord box (76) has a first opening (144) 

directed to a cord outlet lid (94) and a second opening 
(145) directed at substantially right angles to the first 

opening (144), and a charging cord (73) is passed through 
the first opening (144) and the second opening (145). 
In storing the charging cord into the box, the 
charging cord can be lowered spontaneously by its own 

weight. Further, in drawing the charging cord from the 
box, a base portion of the charging cord is merely bent 

and no undue external force is applied to the charging 
cord. Accordingly, damage to the charging cord can be 

suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in
a charging cord storing structure for an electric
vehicle.The present applicant has already proposed a
battery supporting device for an electric vehicle in
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-112270, in which a
battery 15 is charged by a charger 29 after opening a 
lid 30 and drawing a cord 31 stored in the vehicle as
shown in Fig. 2 in this reference cited.Further, a charging cord storing structure according to the
preamble of claim 1 is known from Document EP-A-0 539 269.
In this prior art structure, a cord 131 for battery charging
can be drawn out from the interior of a rear cover 119 of
the vehicle through a lid 130 provided rearwardly of a seat
120 of the vehicle. This cord 131 is connected to a charger
129 within the rear cover 119.In washing the above vehicles, high-pressure water is
sprayed against an outer surface of a vehicular body, so
that the water easily enters the inside of the vehicle
from a gap around the lid . Accordingly, it is
necessary to improve air tightness of the lid ,
causing a complexity in structure around the lid and
an increase in cost. Furthermore, it is also necessary
to periodically check a degree of air tightness of the
lid , causing an increase in burden on a person for
maintaining the vehicle. In the above prior art structure , the storing of the cord
is not effected in a controlled manner. This results in
inconvenience because the cord is stored in a non-reproduceable
special arrangement within the vehicle, and therefore
it is possible that the cord gets caught, thus hindering an
easy charging operation.Further, a direction of drawing the cord is
substantially identical with a direction of mounting a
base portion of the cord (concretely, a direction of
projecting the cord from the charger ). Therefore,
a tension is frequently applied to the base portion of
the cord . Accordingly, it is necessary to improve
the rigidity of the base portion of the cord , causing
an increase in cost.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a charging cord storing structure which permits
the charging operation to be carried out easily and which has an
improved resistance to the
tension applied to the cord.According to the present invention, there is
provided a charging cord storing structure for an
electric vehicle according to claim 1. The charging cord box for storing the
charging cord is formed with a first opening and a
second opening directed at substantially right angles to
the first opening.The charging cord is
