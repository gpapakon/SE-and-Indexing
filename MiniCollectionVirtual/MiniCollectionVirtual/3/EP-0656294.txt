<ABSTRACT>
The punched cardboard box is of the type which is delivered to the 
customers in a flattened condition with a pair of opposite walls (A) 

already formed and a pair of opposite walls (B) to be formed. This 
pairs of walls are connected by bellows tabs (29) foldable along an 

oblique folding line (12) and the purpose of which is to produce the 
erection of the formed walls (A) during the box assembly for obtaining 

the use conformation thereof. Each bellows tab (29) has a projecting 
tongue (30) to be folded and glued to the inner surface of the 

adjacent wall (B) to be formed. The oblique folding line (12) of the 
bellows tabs (29) is interrupted by a slot (13, 13') extending 

parallel to the folding lines of the walls (B) to be formed. The slot 
(13,13') in the bellows tabs (29) can terminate in an arcuate segment 

(S) or have a triangular shape with rounded apex (S) to minimize the 
tearing danger of the bellows tabs (29) during the box assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to punched cardboard boxes, of the 
type which is delivered to the customers in a flattened condition and 
having a pair of opposite walls already formed and a pair of opposite 
walls to be formed, these walls being attached to each other by means 
of bellows tabs permitting the assembly of the box by exerting a force 
on the opposite walls to be formed and, more particularly, to an 
improved box of this type. In this context under the term "wall" both 
simple walls and cavity walls (hollow walls) are intended. As known, the boxes of this type are delivered in a flattened condition 
in order to occupy a very small space during the transport. 
Since they have a pair of opposite walls already formed, it is 
necessary to form only the other pair of opposite walls to obtain the 
box in the use condition, thereby offering the further advantage of 
requiring a lower number of assembly operations. For example, for forming the box a single cardboard blanc is used and 
by starting therefrom a pair of opposite walls are first formed which 
then are folded in a flattened condition to be delivered to the 
customers. The pair of already formed walls are connected to the other 
pair of opposite walls to be formed by means of suitable bellows tabs 
which have the function to produce the erection of the formed opposite 
walls when the opposite walls to be formed are mounted in order to 
obtain the use condition of the box. The assembly of the box can be carried out by hand or by means of 
machines suitable for this operation, the latter solution being of 
course preferred because of the high assembly speed which can be 
obtained thereby.  The walls to be formed are possibly provided with means for locking 
them in the assembled condition. This feature offers the great 
advantage of permitting the assembly of the box by means of machines. However, the boxes of this type are again affected by disadvantages 
both from the assembly technology standpoint and from a merely 
aesthetic standpoint. From the standpoint of the assembly technlogy it can be said that when 
the box is assembled by means of machines suitable for this operation, 
the bellows tabs glued to the inner surfaces of the walls to be formed 
undergo a tearing action, principally at their oblique folding line, 
what can lead to a breakage thereof. Furthermore, always from this standpoint, it can be said that, 
particularly in boxes having cavity sidewalls, the bellows tabs ca 
cause glueing disadvantages because the box

<CLAIMS>
Punched cardboard box of the type delivered to the customers in 
a flattened condition and having a pair of opposite walls (A) already 

formed and a pair of opposite walls (B) to be formed connected to the 
walls (A) already formed by means of bellows tabs (29) foldable along 

an oblique folding line (12) and having the function to produce the 
erection of the walls (A) already formed during the assembly of the 

box for obtaining a use configuration thereof, characterized in that: 

said bellows tabs (29) have a projecting tongue (30) intended to be 
inwardly folded and to be glued against the inner surface of the 

adjacent wall (B) to be formed, and 
said oblique folding line (12) of the bellows tabs (29) is 
interrupted by a slot (13, 13') extending substantially perpendicular 

to the folding lines of the walls (A) already formed and which is 
intended to minimize the tearing danger of the bellows tabs (29) 

during the box assembly. 
Box according to claim 1, characterized in that said slot (13) 
terminates in an arcuate segment (S) intended to resolve the tearing 

forces acting on the bellows tabs (29). 
Box according to claim 1, characterized in that said slot (13') 
is triangular in shape with rounded apex (S) which is intended to 

resolve the tearing forces acting on the bellows tabs (29). 
Box according to claims 1-3, characterized in that the outer 
visible surface of the projecting tongue (30) is the same as that of 

the outside of the box, so that visible contrasts in the corners of 
the boxes cannot be remarked. 
Box according to claims 1-3, characterized in that said folding 
of the projecting tongue (30) eliminates the so called "bag-effect" 

occurring in the case of boxes having higher sidewalls.
