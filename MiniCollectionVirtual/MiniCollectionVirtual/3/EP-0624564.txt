<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing ethyl t-butyl ether in one step 
which comprises reacting tertiary butanol and ethanol in 

the presence of a catalyst selected from β-zeolite and β-zeolite 
modified with multimetals selected from the group 

consisting of Groups IB, VB, VIB, VIIB or VIII of the 
Periodic Table at a temperature of 20°C to 250°C and 0.1 to 

7.0 MPa. The product comprises a two-phase mix of an 
ETBE-isobutylene and, optionally, diisobutylene product-rich 

phase and a heavier aqueous ethanol-rich phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for 
preparing ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) in one step 
by the reaction of tertiary butanol and ethanol in the 
presence of a catalyst comprising a β-zeolite alone or 
modified with one or more metals selected from the group 
consisting of Groups IB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the 
Periodic Table as defined in the Condensed Chemical 
Dictionary, page 789. Metals which work well include 
transition metals found in Row 1 of Groups IB, VIB, 
VIIB, and VIII, particularly iron, copper, chromium, 
manganese, and nickel. The invention is especially 
advantageous in that the multimetal-modified zeolites 
exhibit both high activity during ethyl t-butyl ether 
synthesis from ethanol plus t-butanol and, additionally, 
allow for the cosynthesis of isobutylene and 
diisobutylene. Generally, it is known that asymmetrical C4-C7 
alkyl tertiary alkyl ethers are particularly useful as 
octane improvers for liquid fuels, especially gasoline. 
Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl t-butyl ether 
(ETBE), isopropyl t-butyl ether (IPTBE) and tertiary 
amyl methyl ether (TAME) are known to exhibit high 
octane properties. Much attention has been focused on  
 
production of these ethers due to the rapidly increasing 
demand for lead-free octane boosters for gasoline. It is known in the art to produce ETBE or MTBE 
by reacting isobutylene with either ethanol or methanol, 
resulting in the formation of ETBE of MTBE, 
respectively. The reaction normally is conducted in 
liquid phase with relatively mild conditions. The 
isobutylene can be obtained from various sources, such 
as naphtha cracking and catalytic cracking. The 
resulting reaction product stream contains the desired 
MTBE or ETBE, as well as unreacted isobutene and other C4 
hydrocarbons and methanol or ethanol. Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether has long been 
recognized as a suitable blending cosolvent for hydrous 
ethanol in gasoline stocks. ETBE can be blended into a 
fuel gasoline at about a 10 to 20 volume percent level, 
usually nearer 9 to 12%, in which the fuel comprises 
about 70 to 84% gasoline and 5 to 20% of 95% ethanol, 
i.e. grain alcohol. ETBE solubilizes grain alcohol in 
gasoline in all proportions thereby allowing a wide 
latitude in the precise amount of ethanol which can be 
blended with gasoline. There has previously been some interest in the 
use of ethyl-tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE) as a lead free 
octane booster for gasoline. Note, for example, the 
following publications: Iburra et al.,
