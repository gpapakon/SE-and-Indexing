<DESCRIPTION>
 FREE RADICAL-CATALYZEDSYNTHESIS OF BENZOPROSTACYCLINSBackground of the InventionProstacyclin (I_, PGI2) , first discovered in 1976, is one of the most potent natural inhibitors of blood platelet aggregation. (See S. Moncado et al., Nature, 263, 663 (1976) and R. Johnson et al.,Prostaqlandins, 12, 915 (1976)). Unfortunately, its low metabolic stability due to enol ether hydrolysis greatly diminishes its pharmacological utility. Major interest of late has focused on the synthesis of more stable analogs, such as the benzoprostacyclins Ia-c, described by K. Ohno et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,301,164.
 n R la 1 • n-C5Hu lb 1 CH(__e)CH2C≡CCH3Ic 0 -i-C5HnThese compounds similarly exhibit substantial inhibition of platelet aggregation.Present synthetic approaches to the benzopro¬ stacyclins are very lengthy and rather inefficient. For example, the synthesis of compound la. as reported by H. Nagase et al., Tetrahedron Lett. , 31, 4493 (1990) • requires 23 steps. As reported by . Ohno et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,474,802, the synthesis of the Ci-methyl ester of lb requires at least 17 steps.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 Therefore, a need exists for efficient methods to synthesize benzoprostacyclins.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a method for the synthesis of benzoprostacyclins of general formula II.
 wherein R1 is a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, H or (Cι-C12)alkyl, preferably 

 - al yl, (Cι-C10) acγl or (C7-C13)aroyl; R8 is H or (Cj- C12)alkyl, and R9 is OR3 wherein R3 is H, (C1-C12)alkyl,(Ci-CioJacyl, or (C7-C13)aroyl; or R8 and R9 taken together are keto; R4 is H, F, methyl or ethyl; R5 is C^Cs)alkyl? A is -CH2-, -0-CH2-, -CH2-CH2- or -CH=CH-, and B is - (CH2)n-Z- wherein n is 0-4 and Z is -CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH- or -C≡C-.In compound II, the bonds at cyclopentane ring positions 8, 9, 11 and 12, individually are in either the alpha (extending below the plane of the cyclopentane ring, indicated by a broken line) or beta (extending above the plane of the cyclopentane ring, indicated by a wedged line) configuration, with the "natural" configuration shown for I.. The natural or corresponding inverted configurations are readily prepared by the present method. The configuration at Cx5 may be either (R) or (S) . Preferably, the C8 and C9 cyclopentane ring bonds are both alpha (the "natural" configuration) or both beta.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 Two novel compounds which can be prepared in accord with the present method wherein R1, A," R2, R3, R4, B and R5 are as described hereinabove, are depicted below (Ila,
