<ABSTRACT>
A personal date/time notary device is embodied in 
a token device such as a "smart card" (1). The 

portable notary device includes an input/output (I/O) 
port (2), which is coupled to a single integrated 

circuit chip (3). The I/O port may be coupled to a 
conventional smart card reading device which in turn 

is coupled to a PC, lap-top computer or the like. A 
tamper resistant secret private key storage (6) is 

embodied on the chip. The private key storage is 
cou
pled to a processor (4) which, in turn, is coupled 
to a permanent memory (8) that stores the program 

executed by the processor. At least one clock (12) is 
embodied on the card. A second clock 14 and a random 

value generator 10 are also preferably coupled to the 
processor. The device combines digital time 

notarization into a digital signature operation to 
ensure that a time stamp is always automatically 

present. The user does not need to be involved in any 
additional decision making as to whether time stamping 

is necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
Since the advent of digital signatures, the potential
exists for more transactions to be accomplished
electronically. Using digital signatures, it is possible
to undeniably determine that the party performing the
signature operation is properly authorized to do so.Digital signatures having a "historic" value, such as
those associated with an electronic contract are becoming
increasingly common. In such an electronic contract, it
may be important to be able to prove when a particular
digital signature was performed (e.g., before or after the
time of a possible public key revocation). With many
electronic documents, such as contracts, journals, etc.,
signatures of historical significance become part of
archived records. Without being able to confirm exactly
when such signature was performed, revocation of a public
key as of a particular point in time may cast doubt on any
future verification of signatures which may have been
performed months or years ago.Accordingly, it is useful to know with certainty the
date and time of a digital signature, particularly in the
context of electronically maintained diaries, inventor's
scientific logs, journals, electronic bids, contracts or
the like. It is also useful to convincingly demonstrate
to a third party the signature time and signature
ownership.One way to solve this problem is to "notarize" all
signatures having possible historic importance such as,
for example, by using the applicant's time/date notary
facility such as is described in U.S. Patents Nos.
5,001,752 and 5,163,643. 
These patents describe an effective
manner for performing such notarization using a secure
device embodying a trusted clock to countersign important
digital signatures by signing them in conjunction with the
notarization time taken from the device's trusted time
source.To effectively use known digital notaries requires
that someone recognize in advance that the signature will
have historic importance and remember to apply a time
notarization to the digital signature. The user also must
route the signed material (or some hash thereof) through
the time notary device. Thus, the user must have access
to the trusted time notary facility some time soon after
the creation of the digital signature.Practically speaking the digital notary device may
not be available at the time the digital signature is
constructed. The signer may fail to remember to have his
or her signature notarized in a timely fashion. This is
particularly likely to occur when digital signatures are
made with portable devices

<CLAIMS>
A portable trusted token device comprising:

a token device medium (1) having fabricated therein:
a secure storage device (6) for storing at least one private key and one
user's private key not necessarily distinct, wherein said at least one private key

is used to perform digital signatures associated with a user, said at least one
private key has an associated public key certified as operating from within a

secure time-notary device;
a clock (12) for providing an indication of date and time;
a communication port (2) for receiving a value to be digitally signed
and for emitting an output; and
a processor device (4) coupled to said communication port (2),
characterised in that
 said trusted token device is fabricated on a portable
medium and sized so as to be readily carried or worn by a user, and said user's

private key has an associated public key certified as belonging to said user, and
wherein said processor is coupled to said clock (12), said processor receiving

said value to be digitally signed and said indication of date and time and said
processor performing at least one digital signature with said at least one private

key for output to said communication port (2), whereby a digital signature
produced by said user with said device can be verified by a third party as being

created by the trusted device by the indicated user at the indicated time.
A device according to claim 1, further comprising a random number
generator (10) coupled to said processor device.
A device according to claim 1, further including an additional clock
(14) coupled to said processor device.
A device according to claim 1, wherein said processor device (4)
includes means for validating a user's personal identification password (PIN) as 

a prerequisite to providing the digital signature.
A device according to claim 1, wherein said processor (4) is prevented
from performing digital signatures in response to attempted tampering.
A device according to claim 1, wherein said secure storage device (6)
stores a plurality of private keys, and said processor devices (4) performs at

least one digital signature operation using said plurality of private keys.
A method of operating the user's trusted portable token device of claim
1, comprising the steps of:


a) receiving a digital value to be digitally signed by the medium
carried by a user;
b) determining the current time from the clock embodied within said
medium;
c) creating a digital data structure including the current time, and a
value derived from information to be signed;
d) digitally signing said digital data structure; and
e) accessing a stored private key which has an associated public key
certified as operating from within a secure time-notary device,

said method being characterised by
f) accessing a not necessarily distinct user's stored private key which
has an associated public key certified as belonging to said user.
A method according to claim 7, wherein at least one certificate
associated with said at least one stored private key is stored in the device.
A method according to claim 7, wherein one of the certificates
associated with said at least one stored private key are stored outside of the

device. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein said clock is permanently
initialized at the time of manufacture.
A method according to claim 7, wherein at least one of said private
keys is created at the time of manufacture.
