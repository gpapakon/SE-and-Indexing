<ABSTRACT>
Packets or cells received from different input ports (101₁, 
101
n
) of a switch (102) and destined for a common output port 
(103₁ - 103
n
) of that switch, are analyzed to determine their 
priority level. Lower-priority packets or cells are buffered in 

recirculation delay lines (105₁ - 105
m
) of 
appropriately-selected lengths, and thereafter scheduled for 

transmission to the output port based on their level of priority.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packet switches, and to
methods of routing packets in a switch.Because of the unscheduled nature of arrivals of packets or ATM cells
to a packet switching system, two or more packets may simultaneously arrive on
different inputs destined for the same output. The switch architecture may allow one
of these packets to pass through to the output, but the others must be queued for later
transmissions. This temporary congestion caused by simultaneous arrival of packets
or cells is typically handled by temporarily storing the packets or cells in buffers. For
traffic distributions that are random or more or less uniform, buffering requirements
are rather lenient. However, for high performance packet switching systems
designed to handle bursty traffic, the buffering requirements are more stringent.For electronic packet switches, buffering is ordinarily implemented in a
random access memory (RAM) that is typically shared by all the inputs and outputs
of the switch in order to reduce memory storage requirements. In optical packet
switches, the present lack of an optical random access memory significantly
complicates buffering in those optical switches. Approaches that have been
considered for buffering in optical switches include an implementation that involves
the routing of queued packets to trap lines that retard the transmission of the queued
input packets to the desired output, thereby allowing other input packets destined for
the same output to be transmitted during the delay period. However, this approach
presents certain drawbacks that prevent its use in optical and optoelectronic packet
switches. Specifically, certain scheduling functions needed for the orderly and timely
switching and transmission of packets are not performed in the trap line approach.
For example, the trap line approach (unlike the RAM approach) does not permit
changes to the "scheduled" transmission time of lower-priority packets when
higher-priority packets arrive later.Another approach that has been advocated for buffering packets in
optical switches is the so-called "feed-forward" technique in which packets
contending for an output port are delayed by different numbers of time slots to avoid
collision with previously scheduled packets. In that approach, packets are dropped if
they cannot be scheduled in a collision-free manner. This approach, however, does
not allow transmission time to be updated on a slot-by-slot basis and does not 
adequately support priority traffic.Thus, there is a need for an

A packet switch comprising:

at least one switching block (102) having a plurality of input and output ports
(101, 103); and 
CHARACTERIZED BY

   a control circuit (104) for determining a) priority levels of packets received by the
input ports and b) delivery time of packets to the output ports; and

   a plurality of recirculatlon delay elements (105), each one of which is connected
to a dedicated one of said input ports and a dedicated one of said ou
tput ports, at least
one of said delay elements providing a delay that is different from the delay provided by

a different one of said delay elements, said switch arranged for buffering in a selected
one of the recirculation delay elements a lower-priority packet which is contending for

an output port with one or more higher-priority packets, wherein said contending is
based on the priority level of the lower-priority packet and the delivery time of the

packets to the output ports as determined by the control circuit.
A packet switch as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control circuit is arranged to

   route the lower-priority packet to one of said recirculation delay elements
until the lower-priority packet is no longer in contention for the output port with at least

one higher-priority packet; and

   keep track of all packets routed to all recirculation delay elements.
A packet switch as claimed In claim 2 wherein said control circuit is arranged to
limit the number of times a lower-priority packet is routed to said one of said

recirculation delay elements. 
A packet switch as claimed in claim 1 wherein the recirculation delay elements
are delay lines that have different lengths and wherein a particular recirculation delay

element is selected to buffer a packet based on the priority level of the packet and the
length of the recirculation delay element.
A packet switch as claimed in claim 4 wherein lower-priority packets are buffered
in longer recirculation delay elements and higher-priority packets are buffered in

shorter recirculation delay elements.
A packet switch as claimed in claim 1 wherein said control circuit is arranged to
keep all packets routed to an output port of the switching block in a first-in-first-out

sequence.
A method of routing packets in a switch comprising:

determining levels of priority of incoming packets received from different input
ports of the switch and destined for a common output port of the switch;
routing the highest priority packet to the output port; and

delay lines arranged to provide different delay intervals based upon the (a) determined

level of priority and (b) the delay interval provided by buffering said lower priority
packet in said selected recirculation delay line, such that lower-priority packets are

scheduled for delivery to the output port after higher-priority packets.
