<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stapler with a staple magazine (22) fitted on a bearing bracket (12) on the base (14) so as to pivot to a limited extent, and a cap section (34) pivotable through about 180  between a closed position and an open loading position and bearing an ejector (32) engaging in the staple magazine (22). According to the invention, the base (14) is bounded at the rear of the bearing bracket (12) by a rear wall (42), while the pivot of the staple magazine (22) and the cap section (34) run substantially in the plane limited by the outside of the rear wall (42). The rear end (48) of the cap section (34) has a partially cylindrical bearing cover (44) surrounding the pivot in sections in a hinged manner and coaxial with the pivot (16) which extends through a narrow slot (46) between the wall (42) and the cap section (34), the width of said slot being constant when the cap section (34) is pivoted. At a point on the partially cylindrical bearing cover (44) there may be a catch (50) which can engage with a notch (52) inside the bearing bracket with the cap section (34) open.

<CLAIMS>
Stapler, having an elongated base part (14) carrying an 
anvil plate (10) in its front region, having a top-loading 

staple magazine (22) capable of swivelling to a 
limited extent about a transverse axis (16) on a bearing 

block (12) in the rear region of the base part (14), 
having a staple pusher (28) guided in a push guideway 

(24) of the staple magazine (22) and spring-loaded 
towards the head part (20) of said magazine, having a cap 

part (34), which is capable of swivelling relative to the 
staple magazine (22) and the base part (14) through 

approximately 180° about the transverse axis (16) out of 
a closed position into a hinged-open loading position, 

simultaneously driving the staple pusher (28), and 
carries a spring-loaded magazine cover (31) and a driver 

(32), which engages into the head part (20) of the staple 
magazine (22), and in its hinged-open position is subject 

to the action of a tension spring or towing eye acting 
upon the staple pusher, and having a detent mechanism 

(50, 52; 40, 56) for releasably locking the cap part (34) 
in its loading position, 
characterized in that
 the base 
part (14) to the rear of the bearing block (12) is 

delimited by a rear boundary wall (42), that the 
transverse axis (16) extends substantially in the plane 

defined by the outer surface of the rear boundary wall 
(42), that the cap part (34) at its rear end (48) has a 

part-cylindrical bearing cover (44) which is coaxial to 
the transverse axis (16), engages in sections like a 

hinge around the transverse axis (16) and projects beyond 
the plane of the rear boundary wall (42), and that 

disposed between the rear boundary wall (42) of the base 
part and the cap part (34) is a narrow gap (46) through 

which the part-cylindrical bearing cover (44) may pass. 
Stapler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
gap (46) has a gap width which remains constant during 

swivelling of the cap part (34).  
 
Stapler according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
the gap over the entire swivelling range of the cap part 

(34) has a gap width of less than 4 mm. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the detent mechanism comprises a detent cam (50), 
which is formed on the outer surface of a part-cylindrical 

bearing cover portion (44) and during 
swivelling may swivel through the gap (46), and a detent 

shoulder or recess, which is disposed on the base part 
(14) or bearing block (12) and receives the detent cam 

(50) in the hinged-open loading position of the cap part 
(34). 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 4, having a 
towing eye (36) which is coupled at one end (38) to the 

magazine cover (31) and engages with its other end (40) 
into the staple magazine (22) delimited by two side walls 

(58), is guided in a push guideway of the staple magazine 
(22) and, when the cap part (34) is hinged open, strike 

against the staple pusher (28) and drives it counter to 
the action of a spring (26) into its end position, in 

which it is lifted off the staples (43), 
characterized by
 
detent members (56) which engage in the rear region, 

close to the top edge, of the side walls (58) into the
