<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for spray drying is provided 
for the acid type of cheese whey or casein whey, 

partially delactosed acid whey or a permeate obtained by 
ultrafiltration of acid cheese milk and/or acid whey. 

A dry neutralizing salt selected from calcium and/or magnesium is 
injected into the acid whey in the spray-dryer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
process for drying of acid whey and/or acid whey 
permeate. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a process for spray drying the acid type of 
cheese whey or casein, partially delactosed acid whey or 
an acid permeate obtained by ultrafiltration of acid 
whey and/or acid cheese milk. This is accomplished by 
injecting a dry neutralizing edible calcium or magnesium 
salt during the spray drying of the acid whey and/or 
permeate products and drying the resulting product. It is well known that the spray drying technology 
leads to severe clogging of the spray tower and the 
associated cyclone if acid whey and/or acid permeate are 
spray dried. This situation results in very short 
running times and therefore, makes it impossible to 
handle the increasing amount of acid whey and/or acid 
permeate resulting from fresh cheese production. The 
fouling and clogging within the spray tower can be 
partly reduced by adding approximately 30 to 40% by 
weight of sweet whey to the acid mix or adding a lesser  
 
amount of sweet whey with an inert anti-caking agent. US-A-3840996 suggests adding a drying agent, such 
as tricalcium phosphate or dicalcium phosphate, to the main 
drying chamber, such as a spray dryer, during drying of a 
mineral containing aqueous protein solution, such as acid or 
sweet cheese whey or a modified cheese whey. When using a 
low molecular weight fraction obtained from the molecular 
sieve resin separation of cheese whey, it is taught to use a 
solids content between about 25 percent to about 35 percent 
weight basis. It is further described how the drying agent 
is added at a solids feed rate equivalent to between about 1 
percent to about 10 percent by weight of modified cheese 
whey solids as feed into the dryer. FR-A-2212101 describes a treatment agent which can 
be added as a powder in the atomization tower during spray-drying 
of whey. This treatment agent contains 1 to 25% 
finely divided silica, 5 to 60% of at least one alkaline 
earth metal salt of a natural fatty acid, and 30 to 80% of 
magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide. In an article entitled "Calcium as an Adjuvant for 
Spray-Drying Acid Whey" by H.W. Modler and D.B. Emmons, J. 
Dairy Sci 61:294-299, there is described a series of 
experiments in which acid whey with a solids content 
maintained at approximately 22 to 24% was subjected to 
spray-drying in a pilot plant dryer. In these experiments 
CaO and/or CaCl2 were added to the whey before spray-drying.

<CLAIMS>
A process for spray drying a dairy product selected 
from acid whey and products derived from acid whey 

comprising concentrating said product by evaporation, 
feeding said dairy product into a spray dryer and injecting 

into said spray dryer up to 10% by weight of the finished 
product of a dry edible salt and drying the resulting 

product, characterized in that the dairy product contains 
crystallized lactose, is selected from acid whey, acid whey 

permeate and acid cheese milk permeate, and has been 
concentrated to a concentration in the range of 45% to 60% 

by weight solids without prior neutralization, and that the 
dry edible salt is a dry neutralizing edible salt selected 

from calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, 
magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide 

and mixtures thereof and is injected in an amount of from 
0.5% to 10% by weight of the finished product. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that 0.5% to 5% by weight of said dry neutralizing edible 

salt is injected into said spray dryer. 
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that 
said dry edible neutralizing calcium 
salt is calcium hydroxide.
