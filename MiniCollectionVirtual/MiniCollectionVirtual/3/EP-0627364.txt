<ABSTRACT>
An impact-resistant wrapping system includes a 
sheetlike wrapping body (1) having a cavity (13) 

surrounded by a flexible wall member (11) with gas-barrier 
properties and a gas-generating capsule (2) in 

which at least two types of materials for generating a 
gas to expand the cavity (13) of the sheetlike wrapping 

body (1). The materials are separately sealed by a film 
and can be mixed with each other upon being depressed, 

wherein a portion permeable only to the gas is formed in 
at least a part of the gas-generating capsule (2), while 

the gas-generating capsule (2) is accommodated in the 
cavity (13) of the sheetlike wrapping body (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact resistant
wrapping system and, more particularly, to improvements
in versatility and handling properties of an impact
resistant wrapping system in which an impact resistant
space capable of expanding or being inflated with a gas is
formed around an article to be wrapped.For example, a conventional impact resistant wrapping
system described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application
Public Disclosure No. SHO 54-136985 is known as an impact
resistant wrapping system for forming an impact resistant
space expanding with a gas. In this prior art system, a
sealed annular chamber of a double structure is made of a
synthetic resin film having gas barrier properties inside
a cylindrical shape. In this impact resistant wrapping
system, after an article to be wrapped is inserted into
the sealed annular chamber, air is injected into the
sealed annular chamber to form an impact resistant space
constituted by the expanded and sealed annular chamber
around the article.In this prior art system, the article must be inserted
inside the sealed annular chamber. For this reason, this
wrapping system can be applied only to articles having
cylindrical (e.g., a circular cylinder) or columnar shape
or a shape equivalent thereto and it lacks versatility.Also in Japanese Patent-Application publication No. SHO
63-502099 (corresp. to International Application No.
WO87/02012
(PCT/US86/01989)), a protective envelope for containing a
fragile article is proposed, in which elastic cushion
material is stuffed in the compressed flat state in
between airtight membranes which are folded double and
which constituite protective envelope. This prior art protective envelope cannot cope with a
variety of articles that are different in shape. This is
because the envelope has a definite shape which is defined by
basically sealing the envelope along the lateral edges and
bottom edges of the membranes so as to form an upper opening.
Thus, this protective envelope cannot be reused nor applied to
articles having various shapes, and it has limitations due to
its capacity for wrapping an article.Furthermore, under US Patent 5,402,892 (US Serial No.
08/113660), a wrapping system is proposed for protecting
various fragile articles from a shock, in which inflatable
cushion material is stuffed in the flat state and it expands
to enhance the cushioning effect when wrapping an article.This prior art wrapping system cannot have adequate
handling properties. This is because the system has a
structure for effective air

<CLAIMS>
Impact-resistant protective device comprising a
sheet-like wrapping body (1) having a cavity (13) surrounded

by a flexible wall member (11) with gas barrier properties and
a gas-generating member (2) in which at least two types of

materials which are mixed to generate a gas for inflating the
cavity (13) of the sheet-like wrapping body (1), characterized

in that said gas-generating member (2) is formed in a capsule
in which said materials are separately sealed so as to be

mixed with each by depressing said capsule, said capsule being
provided in at least one part thereof with a portion permeable

only to a gas and accommodated in the cavity (13) of said
sheet-like wrapping body (1).
A system according to Claim 1, wherein the inner
surfaces of the said flexible wall member (11) of the said

sheet-like wrapping body (1) and on which inner surfaces
opposing each other via the cavity (13), are partially adhered

to.
A system according to Claim 1, wherein the cavity
(13) of the said sheet-like wrapping body (1) is partitioned

into a plurality of compartments, and the said gas-generating
capsule (2) is accommodated in each of th
e said compartments.
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein
the cavity (13) of the said sheet-like wrapping body (1) is

defined by a plurality of cavity layers stacked on each other,
and the said gas-generating capsule (2) is accommodated in

each one of the stacked layers. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
further comprising connecting means (8) mounted on an 

outer surface of a flexible wall member (11) to hold the
said sheetlike wrapping body (1) in an appropriate shape.
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
further comprising an elastic impact resistant material

(9) which is compressed and accommodated in the cavity
(13) of the said sheetlike wrapping body (1).
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein an exhaust-air valve (5) is mounted to communicate

with the cavity (13) of the said sheetlike wrapping body
(1) in order to exhaust the gas outside the cavity (13).
A system according to claim 7, wherein the said
exhaust-air valve (5) has a structure capable of

reinjecting a gas, air or the like again into the cavity
(13) of the said sheetlike wrapping body (1) and of

sealing the cavity (13).
