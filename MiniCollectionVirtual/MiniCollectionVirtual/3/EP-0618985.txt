<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymeric 
monofilament and to a felt fabricated therefrom. Polymeric monofilaments, in general, are produced by 
melt-extrusion processes as is well known in the art. A 
polymeric resin is melt-extruded into continuous strands 
monofilaments by an extruder equipped with a monofilament 
die, and then the resulting monofilaments are quenched to 
form solid monofilaments. Thereafter, the solid 
monofilaments are subjected to a stretch drawing process, 
also known as an orientation process, which includes one or 
more steps of alternatingly heat stretching and quenching 
procedures, to impart physical strength. Woven endless belts for conveying and guiding products 
under manufacture are widely utilized in various industrial 
processes and are one group of numerous applications where 
polymeric monofilaments are used extensively. Many of such 
conveyer belt applications involve harsh chemical and 
temperature environments in which ordinary polymeric 
materials cannot withstand. As an illustration of conveyer belt applications in 
which conveyer belts are exposed to harsh environments, the 
felts for papermaking machines are described below. A 
papermaking machine, in essence, is a device for  
 
sequentially removing water from paper furnish. A typical 
papermaking machine is divided into three sections: 
forming, wet-press, and dryer sections. In the forming 
section, the slurry of paper furnish and water is deposited 
on a forming grid and water is drained, leaving a paper web 
of about 75 weight percent water content. The resulting 
web is carried into the wet-press section on a felt (wet-press 
felt) and passed through one or more of nip presses 
to reduce the water content of the web to below about 65 
weight percent. The web is then carried to the dryer 
section and dried by contacting hot dryer cylinders on a 
felt (dryer felt) to reduce the water content of the web to 
below about 8 weight percent. Although the felts for different sections of 
papermaking machine must be designed and fabricated to meet 
specific needs essential to each section, the felts must 
possess the general characteristics of dimensional 
stability, resistance to chemical and thermal degradations, 
resistance to abrasion, resiliency and tenacity. Both 
metal and synthetic polymers have been used to fabricate 
the felts with varying degree of success. Metal fabric 
felts provide superior thermal characteristics, but are 
difficult to handle, have poor flexural resistance and are 
prone to
