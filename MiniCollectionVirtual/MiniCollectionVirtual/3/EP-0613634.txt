Method of producing sticks, in particular
cosmetic sticks, having a refill, a thin-walled tube (10)

made of an injection-mouldable plastic material being
arranged in a shank (28) of the stick in a first method

step, and then a refill substance (22) being introduced
into the tube (10) from one end (16) of the same, characterized

in that the tube (10) is arranged in a shank (28)
which is formed with a blind hole (36), the tube (10)

being introduced into the shank (28) to the extent where
the end surface (40) of the tube (10) which is directed

towards the base (38) of the blind hole (36) is at a
distance from the base (38) of the blind hole (36), with

the result that said end surface (40) of the tube (10)
forms a retaining shoulder for the refill substance (22).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that use is made of a tube (10) which, on at least one

section (42) of its longitudinal extent, is designed with
a reduced cross-section which is not circular.
