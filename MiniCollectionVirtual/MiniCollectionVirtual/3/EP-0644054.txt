<ABSTRACT>
A printer (100) for individually or continuously fed 
sheets comprises control means which is responsive to a 

paper sensor (700) and which controls a carriage drive 
(132, 137) a platen drive (125) and a lifting device 

(139) for a bail (140) and/or a clutch (820, 860) for a 
sprocket drive (320, 840) for continuously-fed stock, 

and/or a clutch (156, 150) for a feeder (151, 154) of 
individual sheets. The carriage (131) at one end 

carries a first actuator (139), which initially actuates 
a bail lift mechanism and then connects the feeder (151, 

154) of individual sheets, and at the other end carries 
a second actuator (128), which connects the drive for 

continuously-fed stock and, upon further movement of the 
carriage, disconnects the drive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of printing and more 
particularly to a simplified mechanism for positioning 
and moving paper through a serial character printer. In 
particular, this mechanism is capable of accepting 
continuous forms and hand and paper tray fed cut sheets 
of paper alternatively without having to unload and 
reload the printer. Printers may be classified by the rate and technique 
used to print on the paper. Of particular interest due 
to their low cost to both acquire and operate are serial 
character printers. These printers typically print a 
single character at a time using an impact, usually a 
dot matrix impact, ink jet or thermal technique. These printers have two key subsystems, the paper feed 
subsystem and the printing mechanism. The essential 
aspect of such printers being their low cost, attention 
must be paid to the cost of each subsystem. Low cost paper feed systems have been developed in the 
past. However, these prior art systems tend to be 
optimized for one type of paper, either hand fed sheet 
or continuous forms. Although these systems may be 
adapted to accept another type of paper, the adapted 
paper feed system operates with less than optimum 
performance. These prior art paper feed systems add motors and 
solenoids to perform the movement required to handle the 
new type of paper. Additional motors and solenoids 
drive up the cost of the printer. Also, they usually 
require the user to remove and reload the paper each 
time the type of paper is changed. They also increase  
 
the maintenance required to keep the printer operating. JP-A-61-83074 discloses a printer capable of accepting 
printing media from a plurality of different media 
paths, comprising: a frame; platen means, attached to 
the frame, for positioning printing media during 
printing; carriage assembly means, connected to the 
frame, for printing on the paper, wherein the carriage 
assembly means includes a movable carriage, a print head 
attached to the carriage, an actuator attached to the 
carriage, and a carriage drive means for moving the 
carriage substantially parallel to the platen through a 
printing zone defined by a starting print position and 
an ending print position; and feeder means for holding 
printing media along different media paths, the feeder 
means including media drive means for moving media past 
the platen means and supply means connected to the media 
drive means for providing media to the media drive 
means. The printer has a clutch device for selecting 
different

A printer capable of accepting printing media 
from a plurality of different media paths, comprising: a 

frame (110); platen means (120), attached to the frame, 
for positioning printing media during printing; carriage 

assembly means (104), connected to the frame, for 
printing on the paper, wherein the carriage assembly 

means includes a movable carriage (131), a print head 
(130) attached to the carriage, an actuator (139;128) 

attached to the carriage, and a carriage drive means 
(133, 135) for moving the carriage substantially 

parallel to the platen through a printing zone defined 
by a starting print position and an ending print 

position; and feeder means for simultaneously holding a 
plurality of printing media along different media paths 

and for providing printing media from a selected one of 
the media paths to the platen means, the feeder means 

including platen drive means (125) for moving media 
past the platen means and supply means (320, 154) 

connected to the platen drive means for providing media 
to the platen drive means, said supply
 means including 
paper drive means (320), characterised in that the 

feeder means comprises clutch means (150: 820, 860) 
responsive to said actuator (139; 128) when the carriage 

drive means moves the carriage (131) outside of the 
printing zone, for connecting the paper drive means (154; 

320) associated with a respective media path to the platen 
drive means (125).  

 
A printer according to claim 1, and further 
comprising a sheet sensor (700) attached to the frame, 

with control means responsive to the sheet sensor. 
A printer according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
further movement of the carriage (131) away from the 

printing zone causes disconnection of the paper drive 
means (320) from the platen drive means (125). 
A printer according to claims 2 and 3, wherein one 
of the different media paths feeds a continuous medium, 

and when another medium is selected the paper drive 
means (320) is engaged and retracts the continuous 

medium which is then disengaged by said further movement 
of the carriage (131), and when the continuous medium 

is selected the paper drive means is re-engaged and 
feeds in the continuous medium until said sheet sensor 

(700) is tripped. 
A printer according to claim 1 or 2, wherein prior 
to the connection of the paper drive means (154) to the 

platen drive means (125), the actuator (139) actuates a 
bail lift mechanism. 
A printer according to claim 1 or 2, comprising 
first (139) and second (128) actuators, the first of 

which operates when the carriage (131) leaves one end of 
the printing zone, and the second of which operates when 

the carriage leaves the other end of the printing zone. 
A printer according to claim 6, comprising first 
(154) and second (320) paper drive means wherein at one 

end of the printing zone, prior to the connection of the 
first paper drive means (154) to the platen drive means 

(125), the first actuator (139) actuates a bail lift  
 

mechanism, and at the other end of the printing zone 
further movement of the carriage (131) away from the 

printing zone causes disconnection of the second paper 
drive means (320) from the platen drive means. 
A printer according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the feeder means comprises sheet feeder means 

(151, 154), attached to the frame (110) for providing 
sheet media from a tray to the platen means (120). 
The printer according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the supply means comprises a sprocket drive 

(320, 840) mounted on the frame (110).
