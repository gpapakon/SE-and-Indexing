<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of forming complex 
shapes from soft solvent-c
ontaining batches and 
maintaining the integrity of such formed bodies. The 

formed bodies are made self-supporting immediately after 
forming or soon thereafter by contacting the shaped body (60) 

with a drying or hardening liquid (97) in which the solvent is 
soluble. A method is also disclosed for simultaneously 

drying a formed body and creating or increasing the 
porosity of the body by adding solid particles which are 

soluble in the drying liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to method and apparatus for 
making self-supporting cellular bodies with improved 
surface integrity and safer handling during subsequent 
processing. Extruded complex structures from soft batches are 
generally soft and fragile, and easily damaged or 
distorted. This could be avoided by stiffer batches, 
which will not flow unless large pressures are applied, 
typically 900 psi (6,000 Kpa) requiring special extrusion 
hardware which can withstand the high pressure and 
maintain close tolerances in the final ware, such as 
hardened steels, with wear resistant coatings, expensive 
to make and needing frequent replacement. Easier extrusion at lower pressures may be possible 
by heating die and extruder, but requires thermal-plastic 
binder materials which constitute a large volume fraction 
of the batch, for example, as much as 30 weight percent. 
Because of this, the cost of thermal-plastic extrusion is 
higher and any removal of the plastic or binder becomes 
more difficult and expensive. As the complexity and size (frontal area) of the 
extrudate increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
maintain uniform extrusion pressure and therefore, flow 
uniformity of the stiff batches, and the high pressures 
exert high bending stresses on the die center, so that  
 
large frontal area dies tend to bow, yielding inconsistent 
products. A softer batch would reduce the pressure 
required for extrusion, but softer batches to sag more 
easily. Various methods have been proposed for processing 
green bodies from raw material slurries, for example, by 
contacting a sheet or fiber with a solidifying liquid to 
dissolve and remove the solvent, to use gelation methods; 
or to contact extrudates with electromagnetic radiation 
while the bodies are in the die, or as the extrudates exit 
the die. There have been no suggestions to overcome the above-mentioned 
difficulties by extruding complex 
shaped articles such as honeycombs from solvent-containing, 
soft batches by contacting the articles with a 
drying liquid in which the solvent and optionally, 
portions of the solid particles are soluble. We thus propose a method of making self-supporting 
cellular green bodies by a) mixing solid particles with a 
binder and a solvent to form a viscous mixture or soft 
batch; b) forming the soft batch into a cellular green 
body; c) the formed green body into contact with a drying 
or hardening medium comprising a liquid in which the 
solvent is soluble and the solid particles and the binder 
are
