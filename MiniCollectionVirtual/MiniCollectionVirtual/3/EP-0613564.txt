<ABSTRACT>
In this method, a restrictor plate (4) comprising several discrete restrictors (2, 3) disposed in the measurement-beam path (M) and a masking plate (11) comprising several discrete masks (12, 13) disposed in the imaging-beam path (E) in the vicinity of a graticule (7) are moved synchronously so that the restrictor (2 or 3) positioned in the measurement-beam path (M) is simultaneously imaged in the ocular intermediate-image plane (19) in the viewing-beam path (B) via the imaging-beam path (E) by means of the associated mask (12 or 13) and the graticule (7) which has the same outline as the restrictors (2, 3). The device is designed in such a way that the graticule (7) contains the inverse outline, or inverse-outline fragments, of the restrictors (2, 3) on the restrictor plate (4), e.g. in the form of lines, dotted lines, dots or crosses. These outlines are present on the opaque graticule (7) as transparent recesses so that the viewer sees the images of the corresponding outlines brightly lit in the ocular intermediate-image plane (19). Instead of a restrictor plate (4) or masking plate (11), the device may have a pair of restrictor plates (20, 21) or an analogous pair of masking plates. This makes it possible for the restrictor or masking plate to have a large number of different shapes.
