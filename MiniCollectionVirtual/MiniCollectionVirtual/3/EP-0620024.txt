<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrode device for intracorporal stimulation of body tissue, in particular for intracardiac stimulation of cardiac tissue, having an electrode cable which comprises at least one elongated insulated conductor and an electrode head which is mounted on the distal end of the electrode cable. The surface of the electrode head consists in part of insulating material and in part of an electrically conductive material which is connected to the conductor and forms at least one stimulation surface. In order to obtain an electrode device with an abovementioned electrode head which is of simple construction and therefore relatively inexpensive and in the case of which it is guaranteed that its stimulation surfaces make very good contact with the cardiac tissue to be stimulated in the case of an implanted electrode device, and in the case of which the insulating material is extremely biocompatible, it is proposed according to the invention that at least the entire surface layer of the electrode head (2) consists of a conductive material, and that this surface layer defines the desired shape of the electrode head, and in that the conductive material is partly covered by a layer which is made from a highly resistant insulating material (6) and is so thin that the difference between the distance from the stimulation surface to the cardiac tissue and from the insulating layer (6) to the cardiac tissue does not influence the threshold value with the electrode device applied.

Electrode device for inter-body stimulation of 
the body tissue, in particular for intracardial 

stimulation of heart tissue, with an electrode cable (1) 
which comprises at least one extended insulated 

conductor (3) and an electrode head (2) which is fitted 
to the distal end of the electrode cable (1), whereby 

the surface of the electrode head (2) consists in part 
of insulating material (6) and in part of an 

electroconductive material connected to the conductor, 
which material forms at least one stimulation surface 

(5), characterized in that at least the entire surface 
layer of the electrode head (2) consists of a 

conductive material and in that this surface layer 
defines the desired form of the electrode head and in 

that the conductive material is partially covered with 
a layer of a high-resistance insulating material (6) 

which is of such a thinness that the difference between 
the spacing between the stimulation surface and the 

heart tissue, and the insulating layer (6) and the 
heart tissue with an applied electrode device does not 

influence the threshold value. 
Electrode device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the thickness of the insulating 

material (6) is between 0.1 and 10 Âµm. 
Electrode device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the insulating material (6) 

consists of an extremely hard carbon, also called 
"diamond-like carbon".
