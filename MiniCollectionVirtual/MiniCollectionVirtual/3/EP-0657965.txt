<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) has a housing (14) 
with at least one terminal receiving cavity (24) 

provided therein. A terminal (18) is positioned in the 
terminal receiving cavity (24) and at least one terminal 

retention member (16) is secured in the terminal 
receiving cavity (24). The terminal retention member 

(16) is a separate resilient member which is not 
integrally molded with the housing (14). A rib (68) may 

be provided in the terminal receiving cavity (24) to 
cooperate with the terminal retention member (16) to 

prevent the overstress of the terminal retention member 
(16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector according
to the preamble of claim 1.An example of the type of connector described above (US-A-5,071,369)
has a housing assembly which is intended to receive at
least one terminal therein. The housing assembly has a
housing body with a terminal locking member. A terminal
position assurance member is also provided. The housing
body has a mating face and a rear terminal receiving
face which is directed oppositely with respect to the
mating face. A terminal receiving passage way extends
through the housing body from the rear face towards the
mating face and the terminal locking member is
insertable into the housing body from the mating face.
The housing assembly is characterized in that the
passage way has internal wall portions which have a
fixed shoulder thereon which is directed towards the
mating face. A cantilever beam is provided in the
passage way, the beam has a fixed shoulder. The beam
has a moveable shoulder thereon adjacent to its free end
which is directed towards the mating face. The beam is
flexible laterally of its length away from the fixed
shoulder. The terminal locking member has a beam
engaging portion which is positioned adjacent to the
free end of the beam when the locking member is inserted
into the body portion. The locking member is insertable 
only when the beam is in its unflexed position. A
terminal with retaining portions thereon is inserted
into the passageway from the rear face until the
retaining portions are beyond the shoulders. The
cantilever beam is temporarily flexed during movement of
the terminal past the shoulders. After insertion of the
terminal, the locking member can be inserted into the
mating face. The fixed shoulder is preferably on an ear
which is integral with, and extends from, the internal
wall portions of the passage way. The beam engaging
portion of the locking member is moveable against the
beam when the beam is in its flexed condition. This
configuration ensures that the locking member can be
inserted into the housing body only if the terminal is
fully inserted. The locking member cannot be inserted
into the housing body if the terminal is only partially
inserted. The beam engaging portion is positioned
beside, or adjacent to, the cantilever beam after
insertion and serves to prevent flexure of the beam when
the locking member is inserted. The terminal is now
locked in the housing assembly.These prior art connectors are adequate in
applications in which the terminal receiving cavities
are spaced

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector,

having a housing (14) with at least one terminal receiving cavity
(24) provided therein; at least one terminal (18) positioned in the at

least one terminal cavity (24) and secured therein by at least one
flexible terminal retention member (16, 16') secured in the at least

one terminal receiving cavity (24) and having a terminal locking
section (42, 42') and

a terminal position assurance member (12) insertable beneath the
terminal retention member (16, 16') to prevent deflection of a

properly positioned terminal retention member,
characterized in that

the at least one terminal retention member (16, 16') is a separate
resilient member which is not integrally molded with the housing,

overstress means (48, 48') project from said terminal locking section
(42, 42') to prevent overstressing the terminal locking section (42,

42') and that there is provided a slot (82) in the terminal position
assurance member (12) into which the overstress means (48, 48')

project.
An electrical connector as recited in claim 1 wherein the at least one
retention member (16) has also a mounting section (40, 40'), the

mounting section (40, 40') cooperates with the housing (14) to
secure the at least one retention member (16, 16') in the at least one

terminal receiving cavity (24), the terminal locking section (42, 42')
is resiliently deformable and engages the at least one terminal (18)

to lock the at least one terminal in the at least one terminal receiving
cavity (24). 
An electrical connector as recited in claim 2 wherein the terminal
locking section (42, 42') has a base (46, 46') and walls (44, 44')

extending therefrom, the walls (44, 44') have lead-in surfaces (45,
45') which cooperate with at least one terminal (18) to resiliently

deform the terminal locking section (42, 42') as the at least one
terminal (18) is inserted into the at least one terminal receiving

cavity (24).
An electrical connector as recited in claim 3 wherein the walls (44,
44') of the terminal locking section (42, 42') are perpendicular to

the base (46, 46') such that the terminal locking section (42, 42')
has a generally U-shaped configuration.
An electrical connector as recited in any of claims 2 to 4 wherein
said overstress means is an overstress tab (48, 48') having a

generally arcuate configuration and cooperates with a wall of the at
least one terminal receiving cavity (24) to prevent the overstress of

the terminal locking section (42, 42').
An electrical connector as recited in claim 5, wherein there is
provided an overstress rib (68) in said terminal receiving cavity (24)

in alignement with said slot (82) in the terminal position assurance
member (12).
An electrical connector as recited in any of claims 2 to 6 wherein a
locking tab (54, 54') is provided in the mounting section (40, 40')

of the at least one terminal retention member (16, 16'), the locking
tab (54, 54') cooperates with the housing to maintain the at least one 

terminal retention member (16, 16') in the at least one terminal
receiving cavity (24.)
An electrical connector as recited in any of claims 2 to 7 wherein a
dimple (56') is provided on the at least one terminal retention

member (16'), the dimple (56') cooperates with a wall of the at least
one terminal receiving cavity (24) to place the terminal locking

section (42') in a prestressed position.
An electrical connector as recited in any of claims 1 to 8 wherein
the at least one terminal retention member (16, 16') is stamped and
