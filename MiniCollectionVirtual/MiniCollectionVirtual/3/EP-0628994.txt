<ABSTRACT>
In the heat treatment method of a semiconductor 
substrate, a semiconductor substrate is placed in a furnace 

and heat treated in a reducing or inert atmosphere at 
temperature higher than 1100°C for a predetermined time; 

the reducing or inert atmosphere is replaced with nitrogen 
gas, after the atmosphere has been lowered to or when being 

lowered to a predetermined temperature; and thereafter the 
heat treated semiconductor substrate is taken out from the 

furnace. In particular, the predetermined temperature lies 
between 600°C and 850°C. In the above heat treatm
ent 
method, although the substrate is heat treated in the 

reducing or inert atmosphere at 1100°C or higher, since the 
atmosphere is replaced with the nitrogen gas at enough low 

temperature that a nitride film which increases the surface 
roughness of the substrate is not formed on the substrate 

surface, thus eliminating gate oxide deterioration caused 
by the nitridation itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat treatment 
method for a semiconductor substrate, and more specifically 
to a method of heat treating a semiconductor substrate in 
such a way that after the semiconductor substrate placed 
in a furnace has been heat treated within a reducing or 
inert atmosphere for a predetermined time, the heat treated 
semiconductor substrate is taken out of the furnace. With the advance of microminiaturization and higher 
integration of MOS type ULSI, the dimension of MOS 
transistors have been decreased in accordance with scaling 
rule, and further the gate oxide thickness of MOS transistor 
has been reduced more and more. On the other hand, the supply voltage is not decreased 
in accordance to the scaling rule. As a result, the 
electric field applied to the gate oxide of MOS transistor 
has been increased more and more in the operation of MOS 
device. In the gate oxide film, there are some defects, which 
cause to break down by the electric field between 2 and 8 
MV/cm, introduced during crystal growth. These defects in 
gate oxide causes some part of reliability failure of MOS 
devices. Accordingly, it is necessary to perfectly eliminate the 
defects of gate oxide , in particular in the case of micro-devices 
on the order of less than half micrometers. As an effective method of eliminating the defect of the 
oxide film caused by the substrate, such a heat treatment 
method has been noticed that the semiconductor substrate 
placed in a furnace is heat treated within a reducing 
(e.g., H₂, CO, etc.) or inert (e.g., He, Ar, Ne, Xe, Kr, 
etc.) atmosphere at the temperature of higher than 1100°C.  In this method, however, when the reducing atmosphere 
such as H₂ is used, since there exists a danger of explosion, 
the atmosphere in furnace is replaced with nitrogen 
gas after the temperature has been lowered to about 900°C, 
and the semiconductor substrate is taken out of the 
furnace, as shown in Fig. 2. By this conventional heat 
treatment method, it is possible to eliminate the defect 
of the oxide film caused by the substrate. In the conventional heat treatment method, however, 
there exists another problem of the oxide film due to the 
reasons as follows:
 
   Within the reducing or inert atmosphere heated up to 
the temperature higher than 1100 °C, since the natural oxide 
film formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate 
is perfectly removed, the substrate surface becomes very 
active. Therefore, when the reducing or inert atmosphere 
is replaced with nitrogen
