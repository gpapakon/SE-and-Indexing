<ABSTRACT>
In a device for changing the spatial distribution of a quantity of powdery or granular solid in order to enlarge the surface of attack of the solid quantity offered to a treatment medium, the said solid quantity being supplied in jet form (102) via a metering device (101), means for loading the solid with at least one fluid are provided. A velocity component (Vs, Ve) of the fluid is in this case directed perpendicularly to the jet direction (7) of the solid or opposite to this. The concentration distribution of the solid is uniform over a region corresponding to the enlarged surface of attack, in each case at least for part regions which are defined by planes (4a,4b,4c) essentially perpendicular to the jet direction (7). The means comprise an essentially cylindrical nozzle (103) which has at least one fluid-carrying channel (104, 104a). A fluid outlet essentially centrally symmetrical to the solid jet direction (7) is brought about via at least one orifice (105, 105a) assigned to the free end.
