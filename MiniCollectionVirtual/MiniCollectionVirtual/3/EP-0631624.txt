<ABSTRACT>
Antigen receptors on B-lymphocytes are transfected or reconstructed in cells, such as T-lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophage cells and the like. When the gene coding the immunoglobulin molecule is transfected into any of these host cells with the gene coding the polypeptide B29, such host cells do not require antigen reaction with APCs in the context of MHC to effect an immune response. The cells can also be transfected with an antibody to a particular antigen to modify antigen recognition. Constructs containing the sequences which code for the immunoglobulin and related proteins, therapeutic and diagnostic methods, compositions and kits for performing such methods are also included.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RECEPTOR COMPLEXES WITH B29 (IG-BETA OR IG-GAMMA) AND THEIR USES.The invention described herein relates generally to cellular immunity and the recognition of antigen by cellular immune system components. Such cellular components contain antigen-recognizing receptors which fall generally within the Ig supergene family. The differences between such cellular components, e.g., T- and B-lymphocytes can be utilized in accordance with the teachings contained herein.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHumoral immune responses are generally initiated by the binding of antigen to the immunoglobulins present on the membranes of cells. On the cell surface, the antigen and immunoglobulin proteins may react in the presence of one or more non-immunoglobulin proteins, e.g., MB1, and B29, which are implicated in receptor assembly.The antigen receptors of B- and T-lymphocytes are members of the Ig supergene family whose specificity is determined by a series of genomic rearrangements. In both cases, the ligand binding domains of the receptors present on these cells are defined by the combination of independently encoded polypeptides that are linked together by disulfide bonds. In addition, both receptors are associated with a number of other proteins on the cell surface.It has long been recognized that T-lymphocytes are reactive to compounds which are complexed or presented by Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) and/or Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) . Normally T-lymphocytes recognize antigen which is presented on the surface of APCs in the context of MHC. As such, MHC may trigger antigen recognition by the T-lymphocytes. 

MHC is comprised of numerous molecules which tag and "activate" the antigen, causing recognition by the T-cell receptors, binding and ultimately internalization of the antigen by the cell.The T cell receptor (TCR) is comprised of at least seven different polypeptides that include the antigen specific alpha and beta chains, the zeta chain, which is a signaling molecule, and the gamma, delta and epsilon chains, which form a second signaling component. All are required for efficient assembly and surface transport (Weiss and Stobo, 1984; Ohashi et al., 1985; Berkhout et al. , 1988; Suss an et al. , 1988). Comparable proteins to the T-cell receptor associated proteins in B-cells include MB1 and B29, also known as IgMa and IgMb respectively (Hermanson et al., 1988; Hombach et al., 1988; Sakaguchi et al., 1988; Hombach et al. , 1990; Campbell et al., 1991). MB1 and B29 form a disulfide linked heterodimer that is
