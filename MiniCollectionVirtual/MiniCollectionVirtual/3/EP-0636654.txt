<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a block copolymer composition, 
a process for preparation thereof and an adhesive comprising said 
composition. More in particular, the present invention relates to a 
linear block copolymer composition, which can be suitably applied in 
hot melt adhesive compositions and which is colour stable and heat 
resistant during preparation of the adhesive composition and the 
processing thereof. Styrene-conjugated diene block copolymers presently form a 
predominant key building block for hot melt pressure sensitive 
adhesive compositions. As was known from e.g. "New Styrene Block Copolymers for Tape 
and Label use", F.C. Jagisch and J.M. Tancrede, PSCT Seminar 
Proceedings, May 1990, it has been generally accepted that a majority of styrene-conjugated diene block copolymers (further to be 
mentioned SBC's) to be used in hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive 
compositions are formed by block copolymers of the structures ABA or 
(AB)nX, wherein A represents a polystyrene block and B represents a 
poly(conjugated diene) and more preferably poly(butadiene), 
poly(isoprene), poly(butadiene/isoprene) or ethylene/butylene random 
copolymer. Three dominant commercial preparation methods for such 
SBC's have been developed: 
(a) the traditional coupling method, involving the steps of 
synthesis of relatively low molecular weight poly(styrene) 
polymer blocks by monofunctional anionic initiation of styrene, 
addition of one or more conjugated dienes to form "living" 
poly(styrene-conjugated diene) segments or diblocks, and 
coupling these anionic living diblocks to yield linear styrene-conjugated 
diene-styrene copolymer or - by using multifunctional 
coupling agents - multiarmed or radial copolymers, or  
 (b) sequential synthesis of a linear triblock copolymer ABA by 
initial synthesis of a diene midblock using a difunctional 
initiator, wherein the chain is growing from the center outward 
in both directions, addition of styrene which reacts with the 
dienyl anion chain ends to form polystyrene endblocks, and 
termination with a suitable proton donor, and (c) sequential synthesis of a linear triblock copolymer ABA by 
initial synthesis of a living polystyrene block through a 
monofunctional initiator, addition of conjugated diene and 
completing its polymerization, addition of a second portion of 
styrene and completing its polymerization, and termination with 
a suitable proton donor. It will be appreciated that an inherent consequence of 
preparation method (a) is the presence of a
