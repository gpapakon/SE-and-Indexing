<ABSTRACT>
Production of biodegradable polymers with succinyl repeating units is effected by polycondensing an optionally substituted 1,4-butane-dicarboxylic acid (or derivative) with an acid anhydride under heating conditions to distil off acetic acid and yield a polysuccinimide or polyaspartic acid.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing biodegradable polymers
having repeating succinyl units, 
characterized in
that
 an optionally substituted
1,4-butanedicarboxylic acid or a derivative of

1,4-butanedicarboxylic acid is mixed with acetic
anhydride and the mixture is then reacted by

polycondensation, which is brought about by
raising the temperature, to form polysuccinimide

or polyaspartic acid, with acetic anhydride being
converted to acetic acid by the water of

condensation that is liberated, and being removed
by distillation.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 aspartic acid is employed as the substituted
1,4-butanedicarboxylic acid.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 where aspartic acid and acetic anhydride are
employed the ratio of the reactants to one another

is 1:1.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 acetic anhydride is employed in an excess of
up to 50 mol%. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the thermal polycondensation is conducted at
temperatures between 100°C and 300°C.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 toward the end of the polycondensation maleic
anhydride or further maleic acid and a base are

metered in.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the starting materials are reacted
adiabatically.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the reaction is conducted in thermal
polymerization apparatus such as delay tubes,

high-viscosity reactors, dryers, cascades of
stirred vessels, thin-film evaporators or multi-phase

helical-tube reactors.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 one starting component is metered in at two
or more points along a tube reactor or multi-phase

helical-tube reactor.
