<ABSTRACT>
Electrical connection system employed when loading or unloading storage cells (1) onto or from a transporting platform (2), comprising electrical connection means (3) consisting of at least one male-type character (4) and of at least one female-type connector (5), one being fixed to the transporting platform (2) or to the storage cell (1) and the other being moved by a positioning element (6) fixed to the storage cell (1) or to the transporting platform (2), respectively, as well as control means (7), fixed to the storage cell (1) or to the transporting platform (2), making it possible to control the positioning element (6).

An electrical connection system implemented while storage units 
(1) are being loaded onto a transportation bed (2) or while they are 

being unloaded therefrom, the system comprising: 

electrical connection means (3) constituted by at least one 
male-type connector (4) and by at least one female-type connector 

(5), one of the connectors being fixed to the transportation bed (2) 
or to the storage unit (1), the other connector being driven by a 

positioning element (6) fixed to the storage unit (1) or to the 
transportation bed (2), respectively; and characterized by 
control means (7) fixed to the storage unit (1) or to the 
transportation bed (2), the control means enabling the positioning 

element (6) to be hydraulically actuated so as to establish 
electrical connection between said connectors (4 and 5) and including 

delay-type elements so that, during loading of the storage unit (1), 
the positioning element (6) for positioning the moving electrical 

connector (4 or 5) is actuated only after said storage unit (1) has 
been positioned on the transportation bed in a pre-established 

position; 
the positioning element (6) being connected to said control 
means (7) by means of connection elements (9). 
An electrical connection system according to claim 1, in which: 

the control means (7) are of the hydraulic type, and they 
comprise a spring (10), a floating piston (11), a chamber (12) 

containing a fluid (13), a time-delay piston (8) constituting the 
delay element, the resulting assembly being disposed inside the body 

of a distributor cylinder (15) so as to form hydraulic distributor 
apparatus, and a return spring (14) disposed along the external rod 

of the time-delay piston (8); and 
the positioning element (6) is constituted by a single-chamber 
hydraulic actuator having its piston (19) secured to the male 

connector (4) or to the female connector (5), said chamber being 
connected to the control means (7) by means of hydraulic connectors 

(9) constituting said connection elements, and by means of an inlet 
nozzle (16) and an outlet nozzle (17) for the fluid (13), the nozzles 

being provided in the body of the distributor cylinder (15), said  
 

inlet nozzle (16) being connected to the connection elements via a 
non-return valve (20). 
Storage units, in particular used for transporting or storing 
perishables, the units being provided with electrical connection 

systems according to any preceding claim. 
A transportation bed or a stationary bed for storing storage 
units, the bed being provided with the electrical connection system 

according to claim 1 or 2.
