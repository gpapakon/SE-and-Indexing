<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of detecting malignant tumours and determining their mass. The method calls for fresh blood or serum samples from the patient to be stabilized and the shift in the ratio of at least one of the IgG subclasses to the sum of the IgG subclasses, relative to the normal ratio, to be determined in the serum in samples.

<CLAIMS>
A method for diagnosing malignant tumours or 
determining their mass with the aid of properties of the 

patient's serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), characterized in that 
the patient's fresh blood or serum samples are stabilised 

with radical traps, preferably with superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) and in the sample serum the shift in the ratio of at 

least one of the IgG subclasses to the sum of the IgG 
subclasses is determined in comparison with the normal ratio. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
in the serum of the stabilised samples the shift in the ratio 

of the subclass IgG1 and/or the subclass IgG2 to the sum of 
the IgG subclasses is determined in comparison with the 

normal ratio. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the above-mentioned shift in ratio is 

determined by determination of the ÃµS value. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the above-mentioned shift in the ratio 

is calculated from the results of analysis methods for IgG 
known per se, especially chromatographic or immunological 

methods. 
A method according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the above-mentioned shift in the ratio is determined by an 

immunodiffusion assay. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that stabilisation of the serum is effected  

 
with SOD in a quantity ratio of from 100 to 1000, preferably 

300 to 400, IU SOD/ml serum. 
Use of the method according to any one of claims 1 to 
6 for extracorporeal detection of the occurrence of a tumour 

in a patient. 
A kit for carrying out the method according to any one 
of claims 1 to 7, characterized by a stabilising reagent, 

preferably SOD, and an arrangement for determining the 
relaionship of at least one IgG subclass to the sum of the 

IgG subclasses.
