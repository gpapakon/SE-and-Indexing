<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMOSETTING COATING COMPOSITIONSThis invention belongs to the field of polymer chemistry. More particularly, this invention relates to acid resistant polyester coatings containingThere is a need in the coatings industry for high strength, high modulus, chemically—resistant coatings. For high modulus, the coatings must exhibit exceptional hardness, while for high strength, they must have good resistance to impact. As to chemical resistance, it is particularly desirable for automotive coatings to have excellent acid—etch resistance. This invention is directed toward the above objective. Crosslin able polyester coatings resins are synthesized and formulated into industrial baking enamels from which surface coatings can be obtained, the cured films exhibiting a unique combination of hardness ( pencil hardness > 4H) and impact resistance (160 lb—in) as well as exceptionally high acid—etch resistance. It has been demonstrated that thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) possess many advantages over conventional thermoplastics. The self—reinforcement of the ordered polymeric molecules in the liquid crystalline (LC) state generally yield thermoplastics with exceptionally high strength and high modulus. In addition, LCPs have also been shown to have excellent solvent resistance, chemical resistance (e.g., acid, base, detergent) , and weatherability. As described above, these properties are highly desirable in surface coatings. Recently coating scientists have attempted to apply the LCP technology to the coatings art.U.S. Patent No. 5,043,192 (Jones) discloses the application of liquid crystalline polyesters to the coatings industry, while displaying high hardness and high impact resistance. In one of the examples, linear 

 oligoester diols were prepared and modified with p— hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) to yield LC oligoesters. The PHBANdiol mole ratio varied from 2.1/1 to 13/1. It was suggested that the excess of PHBA formed repeating p— oxybenzoyl LC segments in the oligoester chain ends. The resulting resins, however, were highly colored (i.e., brownish). The use of large quantities of the expensive raw material, PHBA, also made the resins commercially impractical. European Patent Application No. 419088 discloses non liquid crystalline esterphenol—capped liquid polymer and polyol compositions in combination with an amino crosslinking agent which provided films having superior properties. The resins were prepared by following a procedure similar to that of Jones at a lower reaction temperature (i.e.,
