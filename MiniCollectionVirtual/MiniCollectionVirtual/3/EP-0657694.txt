<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for burning contaminated adsorbents from flue gas purification, the extracted and contaminated adsorbent, such as, for example, activated coke (charcoal), is ground after intermediate storage to a particle-size distribution of 90% less than 90  mu m and subsequently introduced into the combustion chamber and burnt. In order to achieve this purpose, the burner is aligned with a main furnace, in particular a refuse-incineration grate, or the ground coke is burnt by means of an auxiliary furnace, the adsorbent being burnt approximately in the calorific-value ratio 1:100, optionally with preheated air, before it comes into contact with the grate ash or the grate.

Method for incineration of contaminated adsorbents, particularly
carbonaceous absorbents, such as activated coke,

from flue gas purification of a disposal plant for domestic
or domestic-like garbage, comprising pre- and after-separation

of contaminations liberated during incineration,
using an adsorbent, particularly brown coal coke,

for separating organic contaminants and/or anorganic residuals
in the after-separation, the adsorbent contaminated

in the adsorber is ground, particularly to a grain
size distribution of 90% smaller than 90Âµm, prior to incineration,

and is already completely incinerated prior to
any contact with the grate ashes by a burner directed to

the main firing of the disposal plant which is formed as a
garbage incineration grate.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
ground adsorbent is incinerated by a burner including a

supporting firing.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
ground adsorbent is incinerated in a ratio of heating-value

of about 1 : 100 with respect to the main firing.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
ground adsorbent is incinerated by pre-heated air without

any supply of additional energy.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
contaminated adsorbent is intermediately stored, as known


per se,
 prior to and after grinding. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
contaminated adsorbent is continuously incinerated within

the combustion chamber of the own plant after grinding.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that in the
garbage disposal plant 1 - 10 kg of the contaminated adsorbent

ground into powder per ton of garbage burnt on the
grate is incinerated in a burner inclined in the direction

towards the grate.
