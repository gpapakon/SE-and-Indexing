<ABSTRACT>
In this method, the electric apparatus is switched on and off at a low cyclic rate within the range of 20 Hz to 10 kHz. Each low-frequency cycle signal (a) is followed by a number of high-frequency cycle signals (b) in the range of 10 kHz to 100 kHz which delay the current drop. Due to the preferably sinusoidal current drop at the end of the low-frequency cycle signal, interfering low-frequency noise is prevented and even motor running is achieved with a small duty ratio. At the same time, the advantages of low-frequency cycling are retained and the disadvantages of pure high-frequency cycling, namely high hardware complexity and the requirement for large capacitors and large cooling surfaces for the switching losses of the output stage transistors are avoided.

device being switched on and off at a low clock frequency
in the range between 20 Hz to 10 kHz characterized in

that each low-frequency clock signal (a) is followed by
