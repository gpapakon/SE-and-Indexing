<ABSTRACT>
Inorganic material particles such as titanium dioxide (10) pigment particles (12) are dispersed in an aqueous medium with a polyelectrolyte pigment dispersant (20). A selected, relatively hard, polymeric latex (40), which adsorbs onto the surface of the inorganic material particles in the presence of the pigment dispersant, is added, as well as a film-forming binder (64) to give a formulated coating composition. The strongly adsorbing polymeric latex can include residues of polymerized itaconic acid or dihydrogen phosphate functional groups, or have a high level of acid functional groups or acid functional groups distributed preferentially at the surface of the latex. The adsorbed latex particles space the inorganic particles apart in the coating film (60), improving performance properties. Alternatively, a single selected polymeric latex is used to both strongly adsorb to the pigment particles and to serve as binder, or a mixture of a selected, strongly adsorbing polymeric latex having a low effective glass transition temperature and a conventional binder latex is employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a process for 
preparing aqueous compositions including inorganic material 
particles, such as aqueous compositions including titanium 
dioxide pigment, and more particularly to the distribution 
of inorganic material particles in products formed by the 
loss of water from such aqueous compositions. Aqueous dispersions of polymeric latex are used to 
prepare a tremendous variety of commercially important 
products, including paints, coatings, primers, mastics, 
caulks, binders for non-woven materials, and adhesives. 
Frequently, the polymeric latex is included to form a 
continuous phase as the water is lost in order to bind the 
product together, and to contribute important physical 
properties. In addition to the polymeric latex, most 
products include particles of one or more inorganic 
materials. Some inorganic materials contribute an important 
functional property to the product, such as fire resistance, 
sheen, flatting, hardness, color, texture, opacity, or 
toughness. Often these inorganic materials are relatively 
expensive, and it is desirable to employ them in the 
formulated product as efficiently as possible. In other 
instances, the inorganic materials, for example, fillers, 
may be less expensive than the latex and it may be desired 
to incorporate the maximum amounts possible without 
compromising the desirable properties attributable to the 
latex, such as, for example, binding and tensile properties,  
 
such as elongation and, in the case of adhesives, minimum 
loss of tackiness. Since the polymeric latex is typically 
the most expensive component of the formulated product, 
inexpensive inorganic materials are frequently included to 
reduce product cost. In this case, it is desirable to use 
the greatest possible volume of the inexpensive inorganic 
material, while still retaining the desired performance 
properties of the product, since these properties typically 
decline when too much of the inexpensive inorganic material 
is included. A good example is a paint formulated with so 
much of an inexpensive filler pigment, such as calcium 
carbonate, that the critical pigment volume concentration is 
exceeded. Such a paint will provide a much less protective 
coating for a surface on which it is applied than a similar 
paint formulated with slightly less filler, and having a 
pigment volume concentration below the critical level. One way of making efficient use of the inorganic 
material employed is by dispersing this pigment as well as 
possible.
