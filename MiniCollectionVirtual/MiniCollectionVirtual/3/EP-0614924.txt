<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an aqueous emulsion of a silicone graft copolymer by forming an emulsion of particles having a 
diameter of 0.5 µm or less from a silicone (macromonomer) having a radical-polymerizable functional group and another vinyl 

monomer by dispersing the monomers in water in the presence of a surfactant having a radical-polymerizable functional group 
and copolymerizing the monomers by heating, wherein the macromonomer contains 5-80 wt. % of a macromonomer having less 

than 20 repeating silicone structure units. The process can provide an aqueous emulsion excellent in stability, water repellency 
and mold release characteristics, because the features of the silicone component can be fully exhibited while retaining a high reactivity. 

The obtained emulsion can be widely used in the fields of coating resin, paper converting agent, textile finishing agent, film 
converting agent, civ
il engineering resin, adhesive, pressure-sensitive adhesive, mortar binder, concrete binder, and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
water-based silicone-type graft copolymer emulsion, and more 
particularly to a water-based emulsion for use in a variety of 
fields, such as paint resins, agents for processing paper, fiber 
and film, civil engineering resins, adhesives and tackifiers. Hitherto, methods of manufacturing a silicone-type 
graft copolymer have been categorized into methods in which 
active groups are formed by drawing hydrogen from lower alkyl 
groups bonded to silicon atoms of the silicone and then organic 
polymers are grafted to the active groups, and a method in which 
silicone having the active groups is previously manufactured and 
then the organic polymers are grafted to the active groups. In the former case, hydrogen must be drawn from 
silicone, and therefore suitable methods and conditions must be 
employed. For example, the ability for drawing hydrogen, the 
grafting efficiency and the molecular weight of the organic 
polymer grafted to the organic peroxide are affected by the type 
and the quantity of the organic peroxide and the reaction 
temperature. However, it is difficult to adequately control the 
foregoing factors. In the latter case, silicone having active groups and 
living polymers obtainable from anion polymerization are allowed 
to react with each other so that the silicone type graft 
copolymer can be obtained. However, due to excessive 
complication of the structure using the anion polymerization, 
unsatisfactory range in selecting the polymerizable monomer for 
use in the anion polymerization, high manufacturing cost and  
 
difficulty involved in the operation the latter method has been 
unsatisfactory as a commercial manufacturing method. On the other hand, a method (hereinafter referred to 
as a "macromonomer method"), in which high-molecular monomers 
each having polymerizable functional groups, such as double 
bonds, are copolymerized with other copolymer monomers and which 
is able to manufacture the graft polymers, has attracted 
attention. In this case, the foregoing method has generally 
been performed by means of solution polymerization in which both 
high-molecular monomers and monomers to be copolymerized with 
the high-molecular monomers are dissolved in an organic solvent 
and they are polymerized or by means of suspension 
polymerization caused to proceed in a water-based solvent. 
However, the solution-type graft polymer cannot satisfy the 
needs of the times to prevent pollution and save resources, 
while the graft polymer
