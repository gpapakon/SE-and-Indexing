<ABSTRACT>
A computer 31 comprises a keyboard 28, and a base 22 
with a housing 201 for accommodating either a floppy disk drive 

52 or part of an external power supply 75 which can be connected 
to the mains. When the power supply 75 is fitted in the housing 

201, a sensor 205 prepares a reduced output power state. The 
keyboard is mobile, and there is a hard disk drive 49 which can 

be removed by raising the keyboard from its operating position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a portable electronic computer 
comprising a base with an electronic unit for controlling and 
managing the computer's functions, a housing for accommodating a 
disk drive for reading and writing disk memory, and which can be 
supplied by an external power supply. From European Patent Application No. EP-A-O 426 414, a 
portable computer of this type is known in which another unit, 
for example a modem, can be inserted instead of the disk drive. 
This computer can be supplied from the mains through an external 
power supply which requires appropriate means of transport. It 
is therefore not easy to handle and it is cumbersome during 
transport, or of limited range, in which case the operator 
renounces the external power supply. From patent US-A-4,926,365, a portable computer is known 
in which the disk drive housing is located at the top of the 
base, behind the area occupied by the keyboard. This is possible 
because it is of the "Laptop" type (390 x 300 mm), but cannot be 
adopted when the computer is of the "Notebook" or "Ultra 
portable" type. A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides 
a portable computer of very small dimensions which can be 
supplied from the mains, and/or which can accommodate a 
removable disk drive. The invention is defined in the appended claims to which 
reference should now be made. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be 
described in detail, by way of example, with reference to the 
attached drawings in which: 
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of the rear right of a portable 
computer embodying the invention; Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the rear right of another 
configuration of a computer embodying the invention; Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the base of the computer of Fig.  
 
1; Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of the base of the computer of 
Fig. 2, in a particular stage of operation; Fig. 5 is a block diagram of the computer of Fig. 1; Fig. 6 shows a block diagram of the detail in Fig. 5; Fig. 7 is a functional diagram of the detail in Fig. 6; Fig. 8 shows a partial frontal view of a detail in Figures 1 and 
2; Fig. 9 is a perspective view of another detail of Fig. 2; Fig. 10 is a partial plan view of the details in Fig. 4; Fig. 11 represents a partial front view of the computer of Fig. 
1 in a certain stage of operation; and Fig. 12 shows a cutaway view of details of Fig. 11. With reference to Figures 1-12, the portable computer, 
indicated generally as 21, comprises a base 22 on which a cover

<CLAIMS>
A portable electronic computer comprising a base (22) 
with an electronic unit (23) for managing the computer's 

functions, a housing (201) for accommodating a disk drive (52) 
for reading/writing disk storage and which can be supplied from 

an external power supply (75), characterized in that the housing 
can accommodate at least part of the above-mentioned power 

supply instead of the disk drive. 
A portable electronic computer according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the housing (201) is located on the bottom 

of the base (22), at the rear. 
A portable electronic computer according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the power supply comprises a part which 

projects in relation to an insertable part (202) and in that the 
projecting part is substantially trapezoidal in section, so that 

the computer assumes an angled position in relation to the plane 
of support. 
A portable electronic computer according to claim 3, 
characterized by an extension (204) which can be extracted from 

the projecting part (203) and which, together with the bottom of 
the computer in an area adjacent to the housing, improves the 

stability of the computer on the plane of support. 
A portable electronic computer according to any 
preceding claim, characterized by a disk connector located on 

the bottom of the above-mentioned housing, which is coupled to a 
connector of the disk drive to form an operative connection 

between the disk drive and the electronic unit. 
A portable electronic computer according to any 
preceding claim, characterized by guides (216, 217, 23
1/2) for 
unambiguously guiding the disk drive or power supply to its 

operative position. 
A portable electronic computer according to any 
preceding claim, characterized by means of attachment (208) 

adjacent to the said housing, for matching means of attachment 
 

(209,236) of either the disk drive or the external power supply. 
A portable electronic computer according to claim 7, 
characterized in that the guides and means of attachment 

comprise a pin-slot connection between the disk drive or power 
supply and the parts of the said housing and corresponding means 

in the disk drive or power supply and in the housing. 
A portable electronic computer according to any 
preceding claim, characterized by a supply socket (239) on the 

base and by the fact that the said power socket can accommodate 
a plug (238) of the external power supply, when the power supply 

is inserted in the housing. 
A portable electronic computer according to any 
preceding claim, wherein the power supply can supply the 

computer with a standard output power, characterized by 
switching means (210) which can be enabled in order to provide a 

condition of reduced output power in comparison to the standard 
power, and by means (274) sensitive to the insertion of the 

power supply in the housing for enabling the means for the 
reduced output power condition. 
A portable electronic computer according to any 
preceding claims, which can receive an independent power supply 

by means of rechargeable batteries (58), characterized by a 
recharging circuit (61), which can be supplied by the external 

power supply (75) connected to the computer either when it is 
inserted in the housing or when it is removed from it, and in
