<ABSTRACT>
Mass flow or velocity flow of a fluid is measured 
when passing through a smooth bore pipe (1) by 

transmitting sound at an angle (Î±) to the direction of 
fluid flow through and across the fluid flow as a 

continuous wave alternately in one direction and in the 
reverse direction. The phase relationship between 

transmitted and received sound signals in one of said 
directions is substantially minimised by adjustment of the 

transmission frequency and the phase relationship between 
the transmitted and received sound signals in the other 

direction is measured. The magnitude of the transmission 
frequency adjustment is combined algebraically with the 

measured phase relationship in the other direction to 
produce a mass flow rate or velocity flow rate value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for measuring mass 
flow or velocity flow of a fluid and to a fluid flow meter 
assembly. Fluid flow meter assemblies and methods for measuring 
velocity flow of a fluid are known which employ 
transducers which project at least partially into the flow 
path of the fluid giving rise to undesirable interruption 
and disturbance of the flow path with consequent reduction 
in accuracy of the fluid flow velocity measurement. Such 
conventional fluid flow meter assemblies generally utilise 
a pair of transducers which project at least partially 
into the fluid flow path and through which different 
frequency sound waves are sent alternately in opposite 
directions. Apart from the problems produced by the 
interference of the fluid flow path the use of at least 
two different frequency sound waves undesirably increases 
the complexity of the circuitry required to produce a 
velocity flow rate measurement and prevents the use of 
such conventional assemblies for producing mass flow 
values. There is therefore a need for a generally improved 
method for measuring mass flow or velocity flow of a fluid 
and for a generally improved fluid flow meter assembly 
utilising such a method which at least reduces or  
 
minimises the foregoing disadvantages associated with the 
conventional methods and assemblies. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a method for measuring mass flow or 
velocity flow of a fluid flowing in a substantially smooth 
bore pipe, characterised in that sound of the same 
frequency is transmitted at an angle to the direction of 
the fluid flow across and through the fluid flow as a 
continuous wave alternately in one direction and in the 
reverse direction, the phase relationship between 
transmitted and received sound signals in one of said one 
and reverse directions is substantially minimised by 
adjustment of the transmission frequency, the phase 
relationship between the transmitter and received sound 
signals in the other of said one and reverse directions is 
measured, and the magnitude of said transmitted frequency 
adjustment is combined algebraically with said measured 
phase relationship in said other direction to produce a 
mass flow rate or velocity flow rate value for the fluid 
flow. Preferably the fluid whose mass flow or velocity flow 
is measured is a liquid. Advantageously the frequency of the sound transmitted 
is in the range of from 1 to 5 megahertz (MHz). Preferably the fluid flow is continuous or pulsed.
