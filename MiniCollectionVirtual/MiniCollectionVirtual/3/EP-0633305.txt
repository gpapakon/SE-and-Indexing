<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the 2(1-vinyl-5-hexenyl)cyclopentanone 
having the structure: 
and the process for preparing same by reacting the ketal having 
the structure: 
with the unsaturated alcohol having the structure: 
and then heating the resulting intermediate and uses thereof in 
augmenting or enhancing the aroma of perfume compositions, 
perfumed articles and colognes. This invention also relates to 
the novel intermediates having the structures: 
Inexpensive minty, peppery, pineapple and jasmine aromas 
with natural oily and waxy undertones are highly desirable in 
the art of perfumery. Many of the natural materials (e.g., 
natural jasmine oil) which provide such fragrances and 
contribute such desired nuances are high in cost, vary in 
quality from one batch to another and/or are generally subject 
to the usual variations of natural products. Indeed, at times, 
jasmine oil itself has been impossible to obtain at any 
reasonable price. In the course of the last five years, particularly, an increasing 
amount of attention has been devoted to the preparation 
and utilization of artificial perfumes and odor 
modifying agents possessing the aroma attributes of jasmine oil. Cyclopentanone derivatives having jasmine undertones are 
known in the perfumery trade. Thus, "APRITONE®" 
manufactured by Bedoukian Research Inc. of 21 Finane Drive, 
Danbury, Connecticut 06810-4192 has the structure:  and is described as having a "peach-apricot aroma with jasmine 
undertones". Bortolin and Musco, Journal of Molecular Catalysis, Volume 
22 (1984) pages 319-326 shows a synthesis which yields a very 
small amount of the compound having the structure: 
according to the reaction: 
whereby the major material produced in this reaction has the 
structure: 
Nothing in the prior art, however, discloses an efficient 
process for producing the compound having the structure: 
or discloses the use in perfumery particularly as a jasmine 
substitute of the compound having the structure:
