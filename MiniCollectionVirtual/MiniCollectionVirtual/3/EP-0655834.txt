<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a delay circuit and, more
particularly, to such a circuit for delaying a signal
applied thereto by utilizing charging and discharging
a capacitor.In an electronic circuit, a delay circuit utilizing
charging and discharging a capacitor is called an analog
delay circuit and is widely used to get a desired delayed
signal.Referring to Fig. 1, a typical analog delay circuit,
includes an inverter 403 having an input node supplied
with an input signal 401 and an output node connected a
line 411 and further to one electrode of a capacitor 409.
The line 411 is connected to the input of an inverter 404.
The other electrode of capacitor 409 is grounded. The
inverter 404 outputs a delayed signal 402. The inverter
403 consists of a P-channel MOS (referred to as PMOS
hereinafter) transistor 412 and a N-channel MOS (referred
to as NMOS) transistor 413 connected in series with their
common gates receiving common input signal 401 and with
their drains connected to the line 411. The source of
PMOS transistor 412 is connected to a power supply Vdd
and the source of NMOS transistor 413 to ground. In this circuit, when the input signal 401 is at
the low level, the PMOS transistor 412 of an inverter
gate 403 is in on-state and an NMOS transistor 413 is
in off-state. The capacitor 409 is thereby charged
through the PMOS transistor 412 and the line 411 to a
potential near to supply voltage VDD. The output signal
402 goes to the low level.When the input signal 401 changes to the high level,
the PMOS transistor 412 is turned off, and NMOS transistor
413 is turned on. Consequently, the capacitor 409 is
discharged through the NMOS transistor 413 and the line
411 to a potential nearby equal to the ground potential.
The output signal 402 thus goes to the high level.In discharging the capacitor 409, there is a time
constant RC determined by the on-resistance R of the
NMOS transistor 413 and the capacitance C of the
capacitor 409. Thus, the output signal 402 responds
to the change of input signal 401 from the low level
to the high level and moves to the high level with delay
time depending on the time constant RC. The on-resistance
R of the NMOS transistor 413 depends on temperature and
other parameters for transistor manufacture, and further
varies with the voltage applied to the gate thereof.
The voltage applied to the gate of the transistor 413
is determined by the power voltage Vcc. That is, depends
on a voltage applied to the gate, and the delay time 
is also dependent on the power voltage and thus
