<ABSTRACT>
Melt extrusion processes involving phosphite 
stabilized polyolefin compositions subject to solid 

by-product formation during melt extrusion are 
improved by the addition of an epoxidized ester of a 

fatty acid to the composition. The processes 
involving the improved compositions exhibit reduced 

levels of screen pack plugging during fiber and film 
extrusion processes than that achieved with fatty 

acid salts, such as calcium stearate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to melt
extrusion processes, and more particularly relates to
melt extrusion processes for making polypropylene
fibers or films.Processes for making polymeric fibers and films
are known, see U.S. Patent Nos. Knox, U.S. 4156071,
issued May 22, 1979, Frankfort et al, U.S. 4134882,

1487843, published October 5, 1977 and 1574305,
published September 3, 1986.
Phosphites are
known stabilization additives for polyolefins, see
York, U.S. Patent 4305866, Lewis, U.S. Patent
4403053, issued September 6, 1983 and Valdiserri et
al, U.S. Patent 4302383, issued November 24, 1981.Polyolefin processors are attempting to process
polymer at increasing temperatures and with increased
shear and work on the polymer. They are also
processing polymer which may contain polymerization
catalyst residues. The total residual metal content 
has been decreasing in recent years but the catalyst
residue may still be active.This combination of more abusive processing
conditions and the possibility of catalyst residue
still being active may lead to difficulties when
trying to process the polymers.Catalyst "neutralizers" are well known in the
art and are generally used in most formulations to
inhibit corrosion of processing equipment resulting
from catalyst residues. Typical examples would be:
Ca, Zn, or Mg Stearates, Ca, Zn, or Mg oxides and
synthetic hydrotalcite compositions such as a
product manufactured and sold by Kyowa as DHT4A.In many of the high temperature melt processes
such as fiber spinning and film manufacture, screen
packs are utilized to remove small particles which
may be in the polymer prior to the polymer passing
through the small orifices used in fiber and film
processes. With the higher processing
temperature/high shear applications there is a
tendency for some combinations of polymers and
additive formulations to be prone to screen pack
plugging.Specifically, it has been discovered, however,
that stabilized polyolefin compositions containing
residual catalysts, can generate solid byproducts
during melt extrusion processes. These solids must
be filtered out from the melt stream.For example, melt stream-fiber forming processes
and film forming
