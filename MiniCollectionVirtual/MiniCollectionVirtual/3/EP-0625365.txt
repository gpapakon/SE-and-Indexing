<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a separator for fluids, in particular petrol, oil and waste waters, having a collection tank (2), a separation chamber and a take-off orifice (12) for a suction tube (14) or the like fed from outside. In the take-off orifice (12) is arranged a delimiting device (15) for the depth of submersion of the suction tube (14), which delimiting device responds to the separating line (7) of the fluids (8, 9). The delimiting device has a stop (16) for the suction tube (14), which stop floats in the region of the separation line (7). The stop (16) can be constructed as a physical stop and can be mechanically fixed in the take-off orifice (12).

<CLAIMS>
A separator for fluids, in particular for petrol, oil and 
waste water, having a collecting tank (2), a dividing chamber 

arranged therein for draining off the heavy fluid, and a drawing-off 
opening (12) located on the upper side of the collecting tank 

for introducing an element for drawing off the light fluid, 
characterized in that th
ere is arranged in the drawing-off 
opening (12) a means (15) for delimiting the depth of immersion 

of the drawing-off element (14), responding to the dividing line 
(7) between the fluids (8, 9). 
A separator according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
delimiting means (15) has, floating in the region of the dividing 

line (7), a stop (16) for the drawing-off element (14). 
A separator according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
stop (16) is constructed as a signal-emitting, deflectable stop 

which transmits a signal on coming into contact with the drawing-off 
element (14). 
A separator according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
stop (16) is constructed as a fixable, physical stop for the 

drawing-off element (14). 
A separator according to Claim 1, 2 or 4, characterized in 
that the delimiting means (15) has for the drawing-off element 

(14) a fluid-permeable guide means (17) which reaches into the 
collecting tank (2) and which has a float (18) floating in the 

region of the dividing line (7) and a device (21) for fixing the 
float (18). 
A separator according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
fixing device (21) has an actuating device (22) which responds 

to closure of the guide means (17).  
 
A separator according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
guide means (17) has on the entry side a sealing means (20) which 

is linked to the actuating device (22). 
A separator according to Claim 5 or one of the following 
claims, characterized in that the guide means (17) is constructed 

as a tubular cage or basket. 
A separator according to Claim 5 or one of the following 
claims, characterized in that the fixing device (21) has at least 

one tensioning bar (23) arranged in the walls of the guide means 
for clamping the float (18). 
A separator according to Claim 7 or one of the following 
claims, characterized in that the actuating device (22) has an 

operating lever (24) which is connected on the one side to the 
fixing device (21) and on the other side to the sealing means 

(20).
