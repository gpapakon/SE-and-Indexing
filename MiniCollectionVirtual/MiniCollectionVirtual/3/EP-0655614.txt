<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit implements an on chip thermal circuit 
(12) for measuring temperature of an operating integrated circuit 

die (10) by requiring only one dedicated integrated circuit pin 
(16). A second integrated circuit pin (18) is utilized but is also 

connected directly connected to other circuitry (14) on the 
integrated circuit and is used by the other circuitry at the same 

time that the integrated circuit die temperature is being 
measured. In one form, the second integrated circuit pin is a 

ground terminal. Error voltages coupled to the ground terminal 
may be removed from the temperature calculation by an external 

differential amplifier (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to integrated 
circuits, and more particularly, to the monitoring of thermal 
characteristics of an operating integrated circuit. An important operating characteristic of an integrated 
circuit is the temperature of the integrated circuit's die when the 
integrated circuit is fully powered and in a normal operating mode 
of operation. Such a temperature measurement is often desired at 
a final package test when the integrated circuit is in the same 
form as will be used by an end user. To satisfy this need, others 
have used an on-chip resistor connected to two dedicated external 
pins of the integrated circuit. The external pins have no other 
function than to implement the temperature measurement 
function. An example of an integrated circuit having two 
dedicated pins for temperature measurement of the integrated 
circuit die is the MC88110 reduced instruction set 
microprocessor. The temperature of the integrated circuit having an on-chip 
resistor is measured by using a current source reference and 
forcing a known current thru the known resistance of the on-chip 
resistor. A resulting voltage across the two dedicated integrated 
circuit pins is then measured. The resulting voltage is 
proportional to the temperature of the operating integrated 
circuit. In other words, as the temperature of the operating 
integrated circuit die varies, the resistance varies 
proportionately which results in a proportional change in voltage 
measured across the two dedicated integrated circuit pins. The 
two dedicated integrated circuit pins are required in order to 
isolate internally generated noise and other circuit parameters  
 
from the two integrated circuit pins. Any voltage, current, 
resistance or impedance which is coupled to the two integrated 
circuit pins from internal to the integrated circuit will modify 
the voltage potential between the two integrated circuit pins and 
result in an incorrect temperature measurement. However, the 
price of two dedicated integrated circuit pins to implement a 
measurement function is costly, even in the most advanced very 
large scale integrated circuits. Another type of integrated circuit which uses a plurality of 
resistors connected between the integrated circuit's external pins 
is a resistor network integrated circuit. However, this type of 
integrated circuit functions only to provide a user with a plurality 
of possible resistance values depending upon which pins of the 
integrated circuit are connected. No other
