<ABSTRACT>
A reference current source for generating a reference current (Irf), comprising: 

a bipolar first transistor (2) and a bipolar second transistor (4), the base of 
the first transistor (2) being coupled to the base of the second transistor (4); 
a first resistor (6) connected between the emitter of the first transistor (2) 
and the emitter of the second transistor (4); 
a second resistor (8) connected between the emitter of the second 
transistor (4) and a supply terminal (10); 
measurement means (16) having inputs (12, 14) coupled to the collector of 
the first transistor (2) and the collector of the second transistor (4), and having a 

measurement output (18) for supplying a measurement signal in response to a difference 
in the collector current of the first transistor (2) and the second transistor (4); 
a bipolar third transistor (28) having its base coupled to the measurement 
output (18), having its emitter coupled to the bases of the first (2) and the second 

transistor, and having a collector supplying the reference current (Irf), 
a bipolar fourth transistor (34) having its base coupled to the base of the 
third transistor (28), and having its emitter connected to the emitter of the third 

transistor (28
) via
 a base pinch resistor (36). The base pinch resistor (36) provides 
compensation for variations in the reference current (Irf) caused by spread in the 

saturation current of the bipolar transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reference current source for generating a
reference current, comprising:
a bipolar first transistor and a bipolar second transistor, each having a
base, an emitter and a collector, the base of the first transistor being coupled to the base
of the second transistor; a first resistor connected between the emitter of the first transistor and the
emitter of the second transistor; a supply terminal; a second resistor connected between the emitter of the second transistor
and the supply terminal;measurement means having inputs coupled to the collector of the first
transistor and the collector of the second transistor, and having a measurement output
for supplying a measurement signal in response to a difference in the collector current
of the first transistor and the second transistor; anda bipolar third transistor having a base coupled to the measurement
output, having an emitter coupled to the bases of the first and the second transistor, and
having a collector for supplying the reference current.Such a reference current source is known from the IEEE Journal of Solid-State
Circuits, Vol. SC-9, No. 6, December 1974, A.P. Brokaw "A Simple Three-Terminal
IC Bandgap Reference", pp 388-393, in particular Figures 2 and 3. In this
known reference current source the first and the second transistor operate at different
current densities, which is maintained with the aid of the measurement means. The
difference between the base-emitter voltages of the first and the second transistor
appears across the first resistor as a voltage which is directly proportional to the
absolute temperature. As a consequence, the collector currents of the first and the
second transistor are also directly proportional to the absolute temperature. The sum of 
the collector currents flows through the second resistor and generates across this second
resistor a voltage which is also directly proportional to the absolute temperature. The
voltage on the base of the second transistor is the sum of the base-emitter voltage of the
second transistor, which has a negative temperature coefficient and the voltage across
the second resistor, which has a positive temperature coefficient. This yields a sum
voltage, referred to as the band-gap voltage, whose value is substantially temperature
independent over a wide temperature range.The base-emitter voltage of the second transistor decreases as the
saturation current of the second transistor increases. This follows from the well-known
relationship between the base-emitter
