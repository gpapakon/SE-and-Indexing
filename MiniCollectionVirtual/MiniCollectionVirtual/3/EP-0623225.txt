<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the
interconnection of telecommunications lines, and more
particularly to an apparatus for the management of an
interconnecting and cross-connecting system for optical
fibers.In recent years, fiber optic cables have
replaced traditional copper wire as the preferred medium
for telecommunications. As with copper wires, it is
necessary to provide cross-connections and
interconnections between optical fibers at various
locations in the distribution system. The present
invention relates to a system and apparatus for
simplifying such cross-connections and interconnections.The prior art is replete with inventions on
fiber optic organizers, junction boxes, etc. Several of
these inventions utilize splice trays which slide out of
a housing or cabinet like drawers. In many other units,
the splice trays are pivotally attached to the housing.
Pivotal attachment facilitates access to and manipulation
of the splice trays, as well as minimizing space
requirements. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,266,853 and
4,792,203, and French Patent App. No. 2,559,916. Some
trays are pivotally attached in such a manner that they
can be flipped back and forth like pages in a book. See,
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,373,776, European Patent App. No.
159,857, and PCT App. No. GB88/01120.Common features of a conventional splice tray
include: a spool or reel for storing excess fiber slack
and maintaining a minimum bend radius in the fibers to
prevent undue stress or kinks; tabs or lugs which keep
the fibers from slipping off the reel; a splice area
having retaining clips or other means for attaching 
splice elements or connectors to the tray; and a cover
for protecting selected portions of the fibers. The
cabinets used with these trays often have a movable shelf
for providing a work surface for, e.g., making the splice
connections, and also often include a special panel cover
or other means for preventing access to certain portions
of the cabinet.One limitation in the prior art splice trays
relates to interconnection versus cross-connection of
fibers.
An example of such splice trays is disclosed in DE-A-3 530 162,
which describes a splice tray according to the preamble of the
appended claim 1.
As used herein, "interconnection" refers to the
direct connection of two fiber ends using a single splice
element or connector, while "cross-connection" refers to
the indirect connection of two fiber ends using at least
one intermediate section of fiber such as a jumper,
pigtail or patch cord, there being at least

<CLAIMS>
A device (82) for holding a plurality of optical
fiber splices formed by respective pairs of optical fibers,

comprising an upper tray member (84) having means (99) for
storing excess slack in a first group of the fibers and

means (98) for retaining a plurality of splice elements
(136), and


a lower tray member (86, 88);

the device characterized by:
means (90) for removably attaching said lower tray
member (86, 88)

by its upper edge to the lower edge of
said upper tray member (84)

in such a manner that the two tray members lie in the same
plane.
The device (82) of Claim 1 wherein said lower tray
member (86, 88) is selected from the group consisting of a

cross-connect card (86) and an interconnect card (88).
The device (82) of Claim 2 wherein said lower tray
member (86) comprises said cross-connect card (86) and is

further characterized by wall means (120, 122) for guiding a
second group of the fibers to a common exit point (123) on

said cross-connect card (86).
The device (82) of Claim 2 wherein said lower tray
member (88) comprises said interconnect card (88) and is

further characterized by means for storing excess slack in a
second group of the fibers.
A device for organizing optical fibers, comprising a
housing (10), a plurality of splice trays (82), and means

(72) for pivotally attaching each of said splice trays 182)
to said housing (10) in a page-type array whereby each of

said splice trays (82) may be moved between a first position
and a second position, the device characterized by:


each of said splice trays (82) comprising an upper tray
member (84) having means (99) for storing excess slack in a

first group of the fibers and means(98) for retaining a
plurality of splice elements (136), a lower tray member (86,

88), and means for removably attaching said lower tray
member (86, 88)

by its upper edge to the lower edge of
said upper tray member (84)

in such a manner that the two tray members lie in the same plane;
and 
means (152, 154) for releasably securing each of said
splice trays (82) in said first and second positions.
The device of claim 5 wherein each of said splice
trays (82) pivots along an edge thereof, and said releasable

securing means (152, 154) comprises:

a plurality of resilient tab members (152) attached to
said housing proximate said splice trays (82), adjacent

pairs of said tab members (152) being separated by a space;
and
a plurality of prong means (154), one attached to each
of said splice trays (82), for providing an interference fit

with said spaces between said tab members (152).
The device of Claim 5 or 6 wherein said pivotal
attaching means (12) comprises:


first and second generally parallel, spaced rails (72)
each having holes therein, said holes in said first rail.

being generally aligned with said holes in said second rail;
and
at least two pivot pins (140, 142) attached to each of
said splice trays (82), said pivot pins (140, 142) having a

common axis, extending in opposite directions, and being
separated by a distance approximately equal to the distance

between said first and second rails (72).
The device of any of Claims 5 to 7 wherein said
releasable securing means (152, 154) may further releasably

secure each of said splice trays (82) in a third position
which is approximately halfway between said first and second
