<ABSTRACT>
A machine for seam welding overlapping heat weldable lengths 
of covering, comprising a wheel-borne frame (1) having a 

heating element (33,34) suspended on one side designed for 
insertion between an underlying and an overlying length of 

covering. The machine has pressing means (18,19) and driving 
wheels (11,12) for compressive stress of the upper side of the 

overlying length of covering and for movement of the machine 
in the longitudinal direction of the overlapping seam or lap. 
To make possible wheel transport of the machine, with the 
heating element raised from the underlying surface, and to 

make possible an easier guiding of the heating element between 
the two lengths of covering in the lap, the machine has 

especially positioned transport wheels (26,27) which in the 
welding position will be lifted clear of the underlying 

surface, but by tilting the machine can be brought into 
contact with the underlying surface, so that the machine can 

be wheeled by means of the transport wheels. 
The heating element is suspended such that its leading edge 
will have the initial contact with the underlying surface, 

whereby the guiding and insertion of the heating element 
between the lengths of covering are facilitated and any damage 

to the lengths of covering as a consequence of premature 
and/or undesired contact between a hot heating element and the 

underlying surface is avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a machine for seam welding laps of 
weldable lengths of covering comprising a wheel-borne frame 
having a heating element suspended on one side designed to be 
inserted between an underlying and an overlying length of 
covering, and having a pressing means and driving wheel for 
compressive stress of the upper side of the overlying length 
of covering in the seam area above the inserted heating 
element and for movement of the frame in the longitudinal 
direction of the overlapping seam. The invention has been developed in connection with the 
methodology which is used today for the laying of a roof 
covering on an underlying surface, where the covering is 
unrolled in lengths on the underroof and is laid with a 
certain amount of reciprocal overlapping. The overlap or lap 
is heated so that the lap fuses. A seam welding machine as mentioned by way of introduction 
functions extremely well and is highly conducive to reducing 
the costs incurred when laying roof covering. The transport 
of the machine on the underlying surface when conveying it to 
the lap that is to be welded, and on moving the machine from 
one welded lap seam to the next, parallel lap, presents 
problems. When the heating element is cold the machine can, 
of course, be moved or transported by using the existing 
driving wheels, but when moving the machine from one welded 
lap to the next, the machine cannot simply be wheeled on the 
driving wheels, because these are connected via the 
transmission to the motor and cannot therefore be wheeled 
faster than the driving motor allows. Moreover, the heating 
element will often be hot and could damage the underlying roof 
covering. The seam welding machine is therefore often lifted 
manually and carried to the point at which the next seam weld 
is to be started. This is heavy and load-intensive. The  
 
positioning of the machine with the heating element inserted 
between an overlying and underlying length of covering also 
presents problems. Thus, there is a need for a machine that can be moved easily 
and can be positioned easily in an initial welding position. According to the invention, a machine is therefore proposed 
as mentioned by way of introduction, characterised in that the 
frame has transport wheels positioned transverse to the 
welding direction and outside the heating element, said 
transport wheels being lifted clear of the underlying surface 
in the welding position. When the machine is in use, i.e., when seam welding is taking 
place, the transport
