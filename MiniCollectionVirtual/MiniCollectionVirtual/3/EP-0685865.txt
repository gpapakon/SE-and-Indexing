<ABSTRACT>
The switch system (1) has a number of individual switches (2). the top and bottom face (6,7) of the switch system have slots for electrical connections. The bottom face has connection pins inserted (N,P) for the neutral and power input lines. The top face has an interconnection piece for the neutral phase (15) and a second electrical switch interconnection piece for the voltage phase (16). the connector pins and interconnection pieces can be swapped over to change from the french to a foreign standard.

<CLAIMS>
Bipolar protection device, such as in particular a switch or a
differential switch intended to be supplied by live and neutral wires and to

supply one or more dependent devices, for example dividing switches, the
said device comprising, in a casing (1) presenting a face (4) at the front

or on top, a face (5) at the rear or base for fixing to a support, and two
faces (6, 7) respectively for input and output, two circuits, respectively

for live and neutral, having substantially similar electrical characteristics,
with, for each circuit, two connecting terminals (10, 11 - 12, 13) arranged

respectively on the input and output faces of the casing, the terminals of
the circuits, which appear on the same face, being displaced one towards

the front and the other towards the rear, to permit bridging by rigid
conductors with the respective terminals of the same polarity of the said

dependent devices, characterised in that to be compatible with dependent

devices with neutral to the right as well as neutral to the left, the
terminals of the same circuit, arranged one on the input face and the other

on the output face, are equally displaced towards the front/rear one in
relation to the other, such that, viewed from the side, the geometric lines

joining the input and output terminals of each of the live and neutral
circuits are crossed.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that it
comprises, on each of the input and output faces (5, 6) two terminals of

different types, that is one terminal of a direct clamping type considered
as a terminal displaced to the rear and one terminal of an indirect

clamping type considered as a terminal displaced to the front. 
Device according to one of claims 1 and 2, presenting a
marking distinguishing the live circuit and the neutral circuit,

characterised in that a marking is of the type to be applied onto the
casing, for example by ink jet or by label, of the sort which the

manufacturer can mark neutral to the rigbt or neutral to the left as a
function of the geographical destination of the device.
