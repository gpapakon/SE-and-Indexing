<ABSTRACT>
A device for humidifying and ionizing air comprises a 
first chamber (13,27,4) for humidifying the air, a second 

chamber (14), which is separate from the first chamber, for 
ionizing the air, and means (12,11,15) for aspirating and 

expelling the air through the two chambers, keeping the 
streams of ionized air and of water vapor separate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
humidifying and ionizing air, particularly for domestic 
use. As is known, various types of air humidifiers for 
domestic use are commercially available; one of them is the 
ultrasonic humidifier. This humidifier exploits the natural 
phenomenon of forced evaporation of water when it is forced 
to resonate at a certain frequency (approximately 1.7 MHz). 
In known devices, the water is in contact with an 
ultrasound source, usually a piezoelectric transducer 
driven by an electronic oscillator, so as to make the 
transducer vibrate at the intended frequency. When this 
frequency is brought to approximately 1.7 MHz, the 
transducer causes the water molecules to vibrate, 
increasing their kinetic energy and allowing them to pass 
beyond the surface of the water, thus creating an 
evaporation effect. A drawback of known humidifiers, and of electronic 
devices in general, is that, during the operation of the 
transducer driven by the oscillator, said oscillator is 
heated due to its internal resistance. To allow normal 
operation of the oscillator (and of the other electronic 
components) and prevent damage thereof due to excessive 
temperature, the oscillator has a heat sink made of metal 
(usually aluminum). Since heat dissipation is proportional 
to the surface of the heat sink, the device requires a 
rather large heat sink, thus increasing the bulk of the 
humidifier. The same drawback is found in the electronic 
circuits of known ionizers.  
 Furthermore, as is known, ionizers of different kinds 
are available on the household-appliance market. Ionizers 
use another natural phenomenon, which is the ionization of 
air molecules when they are in contact with an electrode 
which has a high negative-polarity electrical potential 
(5000-6000 V). The amount of air ionization is a function 
of the potential of the electrode. If the potential exceeds 
a certain value, one obtains the unwanted effect (Corona 
effect) of producing ozone. Ozone production is undesirable 
because less ions are produced if ozone is formed and 
because ozone has recently been considered harmful to the 
health. The efficiency of ionization, i.e. the number of ions 
produced in a given time interval, is lower in a humid 
environment, since the water molecules are ionized, causing 
a drop of voltage at the ionization electrode due to the 
conductance of the water vapor in the air. Furthermore, 
very humid air is more suitable for ozone forming due to 
the Corona effect, which produces
