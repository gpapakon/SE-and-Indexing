<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phenethyl alcohol derivative and a 
recording material comprising the compound, which is superior in long term 
stabilizing property for the colored images. Recording materials to which the principle of color development resulting 
from a reaction between a leuco chromogen and a color developer is applied have 
been widely used for thermal sensitive recording papers for output recordings 
by facsimiles. printers or the like or pressure sensitive copy papers for slip 
books simultaneously transcribing multiple sheets, because such recording 
materials can be recorded by using a simpler recording apparatus in a short time 
without undergoing any troublesome procedures such as development, fixing, etc. It is desired for the recording materials described above, the one which 
can develop color faster, retain clear whiteness of the uncolored area 
(hereinafter represented as "background"), and provide high toughness in the 
developed images and the background. Recently, a great amount of recording 
materials have been consumed particularly in a field such as labeling where the 
reliability of recorded images is critically demanded. Accordingly, the 
recording materials capable of providing colored images being stable in long 
term to plasticizers and fat and oils those are contained in the organic 
macromolecules used as packaging materials has been intensively desired. Many 
efforts have been made to provide such recording material from various points of 
view, such as leuco chromogen, color developing agent, addition of stabilizer, 
etc. Nevertheless, the material with desired properties mentioned above has not 
been developed. Diphenyl sulfone derivatives are known as useful as a recording material 
similar to the compound of the present invention. They are well known as a 
color developer used for recording materials. Diphenyl sulfone derivatives one 
of which phenyl is substituted with alkoxy or aralkyloxy and the other phenyl is 
substituted with hydroxyl are proposed as a color developer in Japanese Patent 
Laid-opened No. Sho 57-210886, No. Sho 58-20493, No. Sho 58-82788, No. Sho 58-132593, 
and No. Sho 60-13852, and World Open WO 84/02882. However, any of them 
are not sufficient in the stabilizing property for the developed images. For improving the long term stability of the colored images described above,  
 
many patent applications covering the recording materials comprising a epoxy 
group such as novolac epoxy resin or glycydyl compound have been filed. The
