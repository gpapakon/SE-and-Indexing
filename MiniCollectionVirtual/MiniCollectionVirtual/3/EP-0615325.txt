<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a plug cap device (11) for an internal combustion engine 
wherein an opening (15) receiving a corrugation portion and a cylindrical portion 

of an insulator of a spark plug has a first portion (15a) corresponding to the 
insertion position of the corrugation portion and a second portion (15b) 

corresponding to the insertion position of the cylindrical portion such that the 
inner diameter (P) of the first portion (15a) corresponding to the insertion 

position of the corrugation portion of the insulator is slightly smaller than the 
outer diameter of a major diameter portion of the corrugation portion and such 

that the inner diameter (Q) of the second portion (15b) corresponding to the 
insertion position of the cylindrical portion of the insulator gradually decreases 

from the inner diameter (P) of the first portion (15a) toward an insertion end 
at which the spark plug is inserted to provide a tapered configuration, whereby 

the plug cap device (11) insures an improved electrical sealing property and 
provides high operating efficiency when fitted over and removed from the spark 

plug.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plug cap device for 
an internal combustion engine for connection to a spark 
plug used in the internal combustion engine. A known plug cap device the present invention starts 
from is known from US-A-3,995,929. Other known plug cap devices for carrying high voltage 
to a spark plug in an internal combustion engine are disclosed 
in e.g. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open 
No. 64-8580 (1989) and Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open No. 3-264776 (1991). As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, for example, a known plug 
cap device 1 comprises a tubular plug cap body 2, an ignition 
cable 3 introduced into the plug cap body 2 at its one 
end, and an electric conductor 4 housed and held in the 
plug cap body 2 and connected to the ignition cable 3. The plug cap body 2 is a flexible insulator formed of 
an elastic material such as silicone rubber. The plug cap body 2 is press fitted at its second end 
over a spark plug 6 to connect a terminal portion of the 
spark plug 6 to the electric conductor 4. To avoid leaks between the inner peripheral surface of 
the plug cap body 2 and the outer peripheral surface of an 
insulator 7 of the spark plug 6, the inner diameter of the 
plug cap body 2 receiving the insulator 7 of the spark plug 
6 is smaller than the outer diameter of the insulator 7 so 
that the outer peripheral surface of the insulator 7 
closely contacts the inner peripheral surface of the plug 
cap body 2 for exhibition of an electrical sealing property.  
 For example, when the outer diameter D1 of a major diameter 
portion of a corrugated portion 7a of the insulator 
7 is 10.2 mm and the outer diameter D2 of a cylindrical 
portion 7b of the insulator 7 is 10.5 mm, the inner peripheral 
surface diameter A of the plug cap body 2 receiving 
the spark plug 6 is 9.5 mm which is smaller than the outer 
diameter D1 of the major diameter portion of the corrugated 
portion 7a. The inner diameter of the plug cap body 2 
is of the same size or slightly increases gradually in a 
tapered configuration in a portion corresponding to the insertion 
position of the cylindrical portion 7b toward an 
insertion end at which the spark plug 6 is relatively inserted 
into the plug cap body 2. The inner diameter B of 
the plug cap body 2 at the insertion end is 9.9 mm. Recently, a need has arisen to improve the electrical 
sealing property with increasing voltage required for the 
spark plug 6. For improvement in the electrical sealing property, the 
plug cap body 2 has been designed
