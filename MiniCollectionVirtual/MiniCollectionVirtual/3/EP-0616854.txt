<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gluing device for covering sheets for connecting filter plugs and cigarettes, use being made of a transfer roller which is provided with an impression and intended for transferring a corresponding glue pattern onto the covering-paper web. The aim is to improve the glue transfer. This is achieved by a supply chamber (3) which is kept under superatmospheric pressure with the glue and through which the transfer roller (2) runs. In this arrangement, use is made of a glue pump (22) which is controlled, in terms of its delivery capacity, in dependence on the speed of rotation of the transfer roller. The impression is thus more or less overfilled, in dependence on the speed of rotation, with glue such that the latter, after the passage of a doctor blade (8), expands up to an application zone (13), and extends out of the impression, to such an extent that reliable contact with the paper web (19) is ensured.
