<ABSTRACT>
Air is separated by a cryogenic distillation process 
using a distillation column system which comprises at least 

two distillation columns (920,921) wherein the top of the 
higher pressure column (920) is in thermal communication 

(915) with the lower pressure column (921). A portion 
(120) of the compressed, contaminant-free, feed air (100) 

is condensed by appropriate means, such as against 
vaporization of liquid oxygen (22) or other source of 

refrigeration (910,911) and at least a portion (132,144) of 
this liquid air is used as impure reflux in one of the 

distillation columns (921). A waste vapor stream (40) is 
removed from a location situated no more than four 

theoretical stages above the location where the liquid air 
is fed to the column, such that this waste vapor stream has 

a nitrogen mole fraction of less than 0.95.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of nitrogen and oxygen by the cryogenic 
distillation of air. The most commonly used and most well known air 
separation process for oxygen production is the Linde 
double column cycle invented in the first half of the 
century. The basic concept of the Linde double column 
cycle is to have thermal communication between the top of 
the higher pressure column and the bottom of the lower 
pressure column to condense the vapor nitrogen from the 
higher pressure column and reboil the liquid oxygen in the 
bottom of the lower pressure column. A portion of the 
liquid nitrogen that is taken out of the higher pressure 
column is then sent to the top of the lower pressure column 
as the reflux. Such an air separation plant can recover 
more than 90% of the oxygen in the feed air, so that vapor 
coming out of the lower pressure contains more than 97% 
nitrogen. In cases in which large quantities of nitrogen 
is demanded as coproduct, and the nitrogen has to meet a 
certain purity requirement, a waste stream is taken out a 
few trays below the top of the lower pressure column in 
order to control the nitrogen product purity. Such waste 
streams, however, are still designed to contain more than 
95% nitrogen so that the recovery of oxygen, and that of 
argon, can be kept high. Flow of such a waste stream is 
also usually limited to below 15%, which is enough for 
regeneration of the mole sieve adsorption bed using thermal 
swing adsorption-desorption technique. When liquid is also produced in substantial 
quantities, the conventional method is to introduce a  
 
refrigeration system in which nitrogen is used as the 
working fluid. This system produces liquid nitrogen which 
is used as product and/or additional reflux for the air 
separation unit which, still keeps the Linde double column 
with characteristics described above, such as can be seen 
in US-A-3,605,422. When the liquid/feed ratio is 
relatively small, a refrigeration system in which air is 
used as the working fluid can be used. Such a liquefier 
uses the refrigeration from expansion of a portion of the 
high pressure air to condense another portion of high 
pressure air. The air separation unit, however, is still 
the Linde double column cycle with characteristics 
described before, such as is shown by US-A-4,152,130. Since the above mentioned processes all use the 
conventional Linde double column cycle, which achieves an 
essentially complete separation of air into oxygen and 
nitrogen
