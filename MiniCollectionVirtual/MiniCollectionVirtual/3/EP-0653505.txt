<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a nipper apparatus for use in a comber 
comprising a nipper frame (1) having a cushion plate (2) fixed 

to its lower portion, said nipper frame being 
suspended as a whole by a nipper pivot (6) and a nipper 

shaft (4) and being arranged to swing toward and away from 
a detaching roller (10) by a reciprocating turn of said 

nipper shaft, said nipper apparatus being arranged to 
repeat gripping and releasing of a fleece (17) on said 

cushion plate by means of a nipper knife (12) by causing a 
nipper arm (11) having said nipper knife at its front end 

and a spring rod (14) at its rear end to turn according to 
a swing of said nipper frame (1),

 
   in which a spring end portion (14a) of said spring 

rod (14) which serves as a point for providing pressure 
support for said nipper arm is supported movable with 

respect to a machine frame, said spring end portion 
being moved to a predetermined position according to a 

change in a nipper gauge and refixed in that position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nipper 
apparatus for use in a comber which is arranged so 
that the timing of the opening and closing of a nipper 
knife and the swing of a nipper frame can be readily 
adjusted according to a change of a nipper gauge. First of all, the outline of the construction of 
a nipper apparatus for a comber will be described 
below with reference to Figs. 1 and 4 which are based 
on the present invention. A nipper frame 1 is provided with a cushion plate 
2 at its bottom and a top comb 3 at its extending end. 
The front end portion of the nipper frame 1 is 
suspended from a nipper pivot 6 via a support shaft 4 
and a hinge ring 5. The rear end portion of the 
nipper frame 1 is suspended from a nipper shaft 9 via 
a support shaft 7 and a nipper lever 8. The nipper 
frame 1 is arranged to swing, as a whole, toward and 
away from detaching rollers 10 disposed in the front 
of the nipper frame 1, in accordance with a 
reciprocating turn of the nipper shaft 9.  
 A nipper knife 12 is mounted on the extending end 
of a nipper arm 11, while spring rods 14 are 
respectively connected via a support shaft 13 to both 
end portions of the rear end of the nipper arm 11. 
The central portion of the nipper arm 11 is turnably 
supported on the nipper frame 1 via a support shaft 
15. In a prior art nipper apparatus, a spring end 
portion 14a of each of the spring rods 14 is turnably 
supported directly on a machine frame 16. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, as the nipper frame 1 
moves rearward, the nipper knife 12 which is lifted 
from the cushion plate 2 moves downward. Then, the 
nipper frame 1 comes into contact with the cushion 
plate 2 to grip a fleece 17 which is delivered from 
the extending end of the cushion plate 2 (refer to 
Fig. 5). The fleece 17 is combed by cylinder needles 
18a projectively provided on a combing cylinder 18, 
owing to a rotation of the combing cylinder 18. After the nipper knife 12 has moved down into 
contact with the cushion plate 2 to grip the fleece 17 
therebetween as shown in Fig. 5, the nipper arm 11 is 
unable to turn with respect to the nipper frame 1. 
Therefore, a compression spring 19 which is 
compressively fitted on each of the spring rods 14 is  
 
compressed, and the spring rods 14 which serve as a 
link are reduced in length (i.e., a gap occurs between 
an adjustment nut 21 which will be described later and 
a head 28a of a support rod 28 which supports the 
spring end portion 14a of the spring rods 14). In combining the fleece 17 in the

A nipper apparatus for use in a comber 
comprising a nipper frame (1) having a cushion plate (2) 

fixed to a lower portion of the frame, said nipper frame being 
suspended as a whole by a nipper pivot (6) and a nipper 

shaft (9) and being arranged to swing toward and away from 
a detaching roller (10) by a reciprocating turn of said 

nipper shaft, said nipper apparatus being arranged to 
repeat gripping and releasing of a fleece (17) on said 

cushion plate by means of a nipper knife (12) through motion of a 
nipper arm (11) having said nipper knife at its front end 

and a spring rod (14) at its rear end which turn according to 
a swing of said nipper frame (1),
 
in which a spring end portion (14a) of said spring rod 

(14) which serves as a point for providing pressure 
support for said nipper arm (11) is turnably movable supported with 

respect to a machine frame, said 
spring end portion of the spring rod (14) is adjustable 

with respect to a change in a nipper gauge,
characterized
 in that
 
a spring end bracket (22) is turnably and fixably 

supported on said machine frame (16) and said spring end 
portion (14a) of said spring rod (14) is turnably 

supported on said spring end bracket (22), a fixing 
position of said spring end bracket being changed  

 
with respect to said machine 

frame (16) according to a change in the nipper gauge 
whereby the spring end portion (14a) of the spring rod
