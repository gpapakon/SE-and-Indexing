<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses an improved measuring/dispensing device for granular of powder products comprising: a first element (2; 200; 310), fastened on the container (3; 315) of the product (8; 314) and foreseen with at least one first opening (26); a second element (4) innerly matching said first element (2; 200; 310), wherein it defines at least one dispensing duct and complete with at least one second opening (44) communicating with said at least one first opening (26) of said first element; a lid (6; 203; 323) applied on the first element (2) and complete with an opening (7; 204; 322) permitting the dispensing of the product, each of the mentioned elements presenting slanted walls (29, 28; 47, 46) converging toward the bottom (23; 43) of the element to which they belong and matching each other in correspondence with the top and in correspondence with the bottom of a same essentially cylindrical central zone (21; 41).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a measuring/dispensing device for
granular or powder products.A number of measuring/dispensing devices for powder or
granular substances find an increasingly wider use on the
market. Said devices are applied on containers and make it
possible to dispense their contents in pre-determined
quantities. Special reference is made to measuring/dispensing
devices for detergents and for products for personal
and room hygiene and for pharmaceutical purposes.Some measuring devices belonging to the known technique
consist of a measuring chamber, into which the product to
be dispensed enters when the container is capsized, and of
a collecting chamber, into which the product is transferred
from the previously filled up measuring chamber, when the
container is brought back to its upright position.The dispensing of the product occurs when the container is
capsized again, when the pre-measured product flows out of
the dispensing chamber, while a new quantity of product is
transferred from the container into the measuring chamber.
The patent for industrial invention which makes the object
of the
Italian
patent application No. VI92A000021 in the name of
the same inventor of the present invention, describes a
measuring/dispensing device, wherein the measuring chamber
and the collecting chamber are obtained through fixed
surfaces which intersect each other at an angle.The presence of surfaces intersecting each other at an
angle does not allow a very precise measuring, particularly
when the container on which the measuring device is applied
is handled too abruptly or too slowly or when only a limited
amount of product is left in the container.The US 4,015,758 discloses a device for dispensing a measured
quantity of the fluids or powders from a container.
Said device comprises an outer tubular element with an 
inclined bottom and an inner hollow unit. Said device is
not capable of dispensing different quantities of product.
In order to eliminate the mentioned inconveniences the
present invention has the main purpose of disclosing a
measuring/dispensing device allowing the dispensing of 
strictly constant quantities of product, with very limited
weight tolerances, even though the measuring and dispensing
operations are performed abruptly or too slowly.
Another purpose of the invention is for the
measuring/dispensing device to allow the dispensing of
strictly constant quantities of product even when the
container only holds a limited quantity thereof.The described purposes and advantages are reached by

<CLAIMS>
A measuring/dispensing device for granular or
powder products comprising:


a first element (200; 310), applied on a container (3;
315) of said product (8; 314) which comprises a chamber

(122, 123; 312) holding the measured volume of product,
closed by a bottom (23) and connected with an overlying

collecting chamber (24) through a joining wall (25) having
at least one first opening (26) which provides the access

to said container;
a second element (4) off center inserted inside the holding
chamber (22) of the said first element (200; 310),

wherein it delimits a dispensing duct (151; 154; 320; 321),
said second element (4) comprising a dosing chamber (42),

presenting an open bottom (43) opened to the holding chamber
(22) and a second opening (44) at least partially

coinciding with said at least one first opening (26) of the
mentioned first element;
a lid (203; 323) applied on the annular rim (27) of the
first element and presenting at least one opening (204;

322), communicating with the dispensing duct of said first
element, suited to allow the dispensing of the product,

said first and second elements presenting slanted walls
(29, 28; 47, 46), converging toward the bottom (23; 43) of

the element to which they belong and matching at the top
and at the bottom of an essentially cylindrical zone (21;

41),

characterized in that the first element (200; 310) presents
a vertical partition (201, 311) with its lateral edges

fixed both to the inner wall of said first element (200;
310) and to the outer wall of the second element, said

partition dividing the holding chamber and the dispensing
duct of said first element into two zones (122, 123; 151,

154; 312; 321, 320) separated from each other.
A measuring/dispensing device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said vertical partition (201) is

arranged parallel in respect of the mid plane (202) of said
first element (200) to define two different volumes of the

two zones into which both the holding chamber and the
dispensing duct are divided in order to contain and to

dispense two different quantities of the product.
A measuring/dispensing device according to claim 1
or 2, characterized in that the first element (310) presents

an opening (316) suited to set into communication the
inner volume (314) of the container (315) on which the

measuring device is applied directly with one of the parts
(321) into which said vertical partition (311) divides the

dispensing duct of the measuring device itself.
