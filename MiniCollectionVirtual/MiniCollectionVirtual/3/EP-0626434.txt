<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerant.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, azeotropic
compositions thereof and like compositions are known as
working fluids or refrigerants. Among them, R-11
(trichlorofluoromethane), R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), R-22
(chlorodifluoromethane), etc. have been conventionally
used as working fluids for refrigerators. In recent years,
however, it has been suggested that some hydrogen-free
chlorofluorocarbons, when released into the atmosphere,
would deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, thereby
inflicting a serious adverse influence on the ecosystem
including humans on the earth. In view of the problem, a
worldwide agreement calls for the restriction of use and
production of major ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons.
Among the chlorofluorocarbons to be controlled for the
restriction are R-11, R-12 and the like all of which are
widely used as mentioned above. With the spread of refrigerators
and air-conditioning systems, the use and production
of these refrigerants are enjoying an annually increasing
demand. However, the control over these refrigerants will
greatly affect our residential environments and the current
social framework as a whole. Consequently, there is an 
urgent demand for development of a novel refrigerant which has
no or little potential to cause the problem of depleting the
stratospheric ozone layer.From EP-A-299 614 there is already known the use of
a refrigerant comprising a mixture of three compounds
consisting essentially of hydrofluor carbons.Unfortunately the coefficient of performance as well
as the refrigerating capacity is unsufficient with this mixture
so that this mixture of three components gives no solution for
the above described problem.An object of the present invention is to provide a
novel refrigerant which has excellent properties for use in
refrigerators, and which would exert little or no influence
on the stratospheric ozone layer, when released into the
atmosphere.During the research of the present inventors there
was found a mixture of three components selected from the group
consisting of specific hydrofluorocarbons (hereinafter simply
referred to as "HFC") with which the contemplated object can be
achieved.Accordingly, the invention is directed to a
refrigerant comprising a mixture of three compounds which
consist essentially of pentafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane.The Figure attached hereto is a triangular diagram 
showing the relationship between the composition of the
present
