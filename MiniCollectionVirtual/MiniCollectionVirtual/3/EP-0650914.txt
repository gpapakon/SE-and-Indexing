<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to obtain a 
package capable of reliably effecting collection 

of filament, bunch winding and tail winding by 
using a tube not having filament catch groove, 

and having a small filament length extending from 
a bunch winding portion. A filament support 

guide (24) for guiding a travelling filament to 

a bunch winding position is disposed upstream 
of a contact pressure roller (7), and a filament 

search guide (29) for guiding the filament to the 
filament collection portion or a filament hanging 

guide (33) is disposed downstream of an empty 
tube (70). Further, a filament winding guide (37) 

is so disposed as to move toward a recess (A) 
defined by the contact pressure roller (7) and the 

empty tube (70) fastened tightly to a spindle (4). 
This guide (37) guides the filament (80) travelling 

towards a full wound tube (70'), etc, to a filament 
collection portion (B) at which the end surfaces 

of the empty tubes (70) fastened tightly to the 
spindle (4) come into mutual contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a yarn winder for
taking up a yarn on a bobbin formed of any kind of
material, with an appropriate initial winding, bunch
winding and tail winding.In general, synthetic fiber yarns spun from a
spinning machine are taken up by a turret type winder
such as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 62-280172.The abovesaid turret type winder rotatably carries a
plurality of spindles, and comprises a turret member
rotatably secured on a machine frame, a traverse
mechanism provided above the spindle, a contact roller
for applying a predetermined pressure in a contacting
manner to a bobbin fixedly carried on the spindle or a
yarn layer section wound on the bobbin, an upper yarn-switching
mechanism provided above the traverse mechanism
or the contact roller, a lower yarn-switching mechanism
provided between a full bobbin and an empty bobbin, for
restricting a yarn path when switching the yarn from the
full bobbin to the empty bobbin, a threading mechanism
provided beneath the lower yarn-switching mechanism, for
restricting a yarn path when the yarn is wound on the
empty bobbin, and an initial-winding forming mechanism
movable between the empty bobbin and the lower yarn-switching
mechanism or between the empty bobbin and the
threading mechanism, for forming the initial winding on
the empty bobbin.When a yarn is taken up by the abovesaid turret type
winder, a bobbin 75 made of paper is used, having a yarn-catching
groove 75A at one end thereof, consisting of a 
yarn introduction part 75a having a V-shaped cross
section and a yarn-catching part 75b having a thinner
cross section, as shown in Figs. 44 and 45.In order to prevent the yarn caught by the yarn-catching
groove from escaping, the opposite side walls of
the yarn-catching part 75b are brought into tight contact
with each other by collapsing the outer periphery of the
bobbin 75, as shown in Fig. 46.When initiating the yarn take-up operation while
using such a bobbin 75, a plurality of yarns spun from a
spinning machine (not shown) are sucked into a suction
gun (not shown), each of which is inserted to a first
yarn path restricting guide of the threading mechanism,
after a yarn-removing guide of the upper yarn-switching
mechanism has come out to move the first yarn path
restricting guide to a position at which the initial-yarn
winding operation is conducted. Then a yarn-pushing
guide of the first yarn-switching mechanism moves toward
one end of an empty bobbin to convey the respective yarn
thereby onto a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A yarn winder comprising a spindle (3) on which a
bobbin (70) is fixedly connected, a contact roller (7)

which is in contact with the bobbin (70), a traverse guide
(6a) located for causing the yarn to be reciprocated, an

upper yarn path restricting guide (22,24) upstream of the
contact roller (7) for guiding a running yarn (80) in the

direction of the length of the bobbin (70) and a yarn
winding guide (37) arranged to face a concave space (A)

formed between the contact roller (7) and the bobbin (70),
the upper yarn path restricting guide (22,24) being

arranged to be first located at a position which allows
the yarn (80) to be engaged with a yarn-catching part (B),

then moved to a bunch winding position of the bobbin (70)
spaced from its adjacent edge immediately after the yarn

(80) is caught by the yarn catching part (B), and finally
moved in the direction of the length of the bobbin (70)

while a tail winding (D) is formed on the bobbin (70), the
yarn being taken by the traverse guide (6a) thereby

initiating the normal yarn winding operation while the
yarn (80) is reciprocated by the traverse guide (6a)

characterized in that said yarn-catching part (B) is
formed by a boundary part between ends of adjacent bobbins

(70) fixedly carried on a spindle (3) or a boundary part
between one end of a bobbin (70) and a side wall (13c) of

a stepped portion of the spindle (3) for positioning the
bobbin (70), the said yarn winding guide (37) is movable

towards said concave space (A) causing the yarn (80) to be
caught by the yarn-catching part (B) and the yarn (80) to

be wound on the bobbin (70) after a fraction (Óúç) of one 
complete rotation of the bobbin, thereby intitiating the

bunch winding operation, and there is provided a yarn
searching guide (29) movable in a direction parallel to

the length of the bobbin (70) to align the yarn (80) with
the yarn winding guide (37).
