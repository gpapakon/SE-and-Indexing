<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous preparation of a granular detergent composition or component having a bulk density greater than 650 g/l which comprises the steps of: i) dispersing a detergent active paste throughout a powder stream in a high speed mixer with a residence time of from 2 seconds to 30 seconds, ii) forming an agglomerate in a moderate speed mixer/agglomerator with a residence time of less than 2 minutes, in which, optionally, a finely divided powder may be added, iii) drying and/or cooling. Granular detergent compositions which are made by this process, and which have excellent solubility properties especially with respect to dispensing and rate of dissolution are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is a trend amongst commercially available granular detergents towards higher bulk densities and towards
granular detergent components which have a higher content of detergent active ingredients.Many of the prior art attempts to move in this direction have met with problems of poor solubility properties
arising from low rate of dissolution or the formation of gels. A consequence of this in a typical washing process can be
poor dispensing of the product, either from the dispensing drawer of a washing machine, or from a dosing device placed
with the laundry inside the machine. This poor dispensing is often caused by gelling of particles which have high levels
of surfactant upon contact with water. The gel prevents a proportion of the detergent powder from being solubilised in
the wash water which reduces the effectiveness of the powder. Another adverse consequence arises even if the powder
is well dispensed and dispersed in the washing water if it does not dissolve rapidly. The wash cycle has a limited
duration during which the detergent can act upon the laundry. If the cleaning action is delayed because the powder is
slow to dissolve, this, too, will limit the effectiveness of the powder.The process engineer and formulator have frequently found that the need for good dispensing and the need
for good dissolution rate have placed conflicting demands upon them. The solution has generally been to find a compromise
which gives adequate dispensing and adequate dissolution rate. For example, poor dispensing of high bulk
density granular detergents is often associated with surfactant rich particles having a high specific surface area, either
due to high porosity or a small particle size (especially "fines"). However, decreasing the porosity and/or increasing
the average particle size cause the dissolution rate to decrease.Prior art has dealt with the problems of processing granules in a number of different ways which are intended
to optimise the physical properties of the resulting powders.One processing route is described in GB 2 166 452, published on May 8th, 1986. This patent proposes a
process for making a detergent composition with a high bulk density and good solubility properties. This process is
based on agglomeration in a kneader forming pellets, followed by granulation to the required particle size distribution
in, for example, a hammer mill.Other processes in the prior art have sought to avoid the step of granulating pellets which is capital-intensive
and expensive. One such process is a high

A process for the continuous preparation of a granular detergent composition or component having a bulk density
greater than 650 g/l which comprises the steps of:


i) dispersing a liquid binder throughout a powder stream in a high speed mixer with a residence time of from
2 seconds to 30 seconds, whereby the liquid binder is a paste which comprises at least 10% by weight of

neutralised anionic surfactant;
ii) forming agglomerated granules in a moderate speed mixer/agglomerator in which, optionally, a finely divided
powder may be added, whereb
y the residence time through the moderate speed mixer/agglomerator is less
than 2 minutes ;
iii) drying and/or cooling.
Process according to claim 1 in which the residence time in the moderate speed mixer/agglomerator is less than
1 minute, and the speed of said mixer/agglomerator is from 60 to 150 rpm.
Process according to either claim 1 or 2 in which the speed of the high speed mixer is from 600 to 2000 rpm.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3 in which sodium aluminosilicate with an average particle size of less
than 10Âµm is added as the finely divided powder into the moderate speed mixer/agglomerator.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 4 in which the porosity of the finished particles is greater than 10%,
preferably greater than 15%.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 5 in which the liquid binder in step (i) is a paste which comprises from 40%
to 95% by weight of a neutralised anionic surfactant.

than 15% and comprising 1 to 8% by weight of free water and having a bulkdensity greater than 650g/l and

wherein said composition further comprises one or more additional granular detergent components and wherein
less than 20 % by weight of the total level of surfactant(s) present in said composition is present in said additional

granular detergent components.
