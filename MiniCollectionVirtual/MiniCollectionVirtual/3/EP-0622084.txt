<DESCRIPTION>
The science of pharmaceutical chemistry has 
progressively provided more and more specific and potent 
drugs for the treatment and prevention of illnesses. 
However, until quite recently, there has been no means to 
direct a drug to the specific part of the body where it is 
needed. Thus, although it is often possible to treat a 
patient with a drug which has the specific effect which is 
needed, and no other effect on the body, it is still 
necessary to administer a whole-body dose. On the other 
hand, if it were possible to direct a drug to the organ, 
tissue or even cell in need of the treatment, it would 
often be possible to administer an extremely small total 
dose, since the drug would concentrate itself where it is 
needed. The advantage in safety to the patient and economy 
of the drug is obvious. For some years now, the science of immunology 
has been attempting to provide such targeted treatments, by 
conjugating drugs with antibodies which are directed to 
specific antigens associated with the locations where the 
drug is needed. Patents and scientific articles concerning 
such antibody-drug conjugates are now numerous. However, 
up to the present time, no antibody-drug conjugate is 
approved for therapeutic use. The present invention provides a physiologically 
acceptable drug conjugate of Formula I  wherein:
 
   Ab is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment 
thereof, which recognizes an antigen associated with a cell 
or tissue to which delivery of the drug is desirable;
 
   R is a drug having a reactively available 
carbonyl functionality;
 
   R¹ is C₁ to C₄ alkyl or a carboxylic acid 
protecting group;
 
   Q is C₁ to C₄ alkylene or arylene;
 
   Y is -O-,-NH-, or -N(alkyl)-;
 
   A is 
      where Z is C₁ to C₄ alkylene or arylene, and 
n is an integer from 1 to 10. The present invention also provides 
intermediates of Formula II:  wherein:
 
   R¹ is C₁ to C₄ alkyl or a carboxylic acid 
protecting group;
 
   R3' is a carboxylic acid activating group, -OH, 
or a salt thereof;
 
   Q is C₁ to C₄ alkylene or arylene;
 
   P is an amino protecting group; and
 
   Y is -O-, -NH-, or -N(alkyl)-
 
   A is 
      where Z is C₁ to C₄ alkylene or arylene. The invention further provides a modified 
antibody or antibody fragment of Formula III 
wherein:
 
   Ab is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment 
thereof, which recognizes an antigen associated with a cell 
or tissue to which delivery of the drug is desirable;
 
 
   R¹ is C₁ to C₄ alkyl or a carboxylic acid 
protecting group;
 
   Q is
