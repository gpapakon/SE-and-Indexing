<ABSTRACT>
In a cover (10) for heating or cooling patients, in particular for protecting patients from becoming cold or for once again heating patients who have already become cold during or after surgical interventions, an inner cavity is delimited by an air-tight upper side and by an air-permeable lower side. An air hose can be arranged on a hose connection piece (14). In order to allow the cover (10) to be used repeatedly, and thereby reduce the disposal costs, it is intended that the upper side and the lower side of the heating cover be made of a fabric which can be washed and disinfected and therefore re-used. The upper side is provided with an air-tight coating. A good distribution of the heated air supplied is achieved by means of the fact that the lower side is produced using a fabric which permits diffuse air permeability.

A blanket for warming or cooling a patient, more
particularly for protecting against loss of body heat or

to compensate loss of body heat during or after an
operation, including an inner cavity (11) defined by an

air-impermeable top side (12) and an air-permeable
underside (13), said inner cavity (11) comprising at

least one hose inlet (14) for connecting an air hose,
characterized in that said top side (12) and said

underside (13) of said blanket (10) are made of a fabric
suitable for repeated washing and disinfection, said top

side (12) being made of an air-impermeable fabric, more
particularly of a synthetic fiber fabric, coated with a

polyurethane and/or silicone coating, and said underside
(13) being made of a diffused air-permeable fabric, said

blanket being intended for repeated use on patients
especially in an operating room environment.
The blanket as set forth in claim 1, characterized in

that said top side (12) is made of a polyamide fabric
provided with said coating.
The blanket as set forth in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that said underside (13) is made of a

diffused air-permeable polyamide fabric.
The blanket as set forth in any of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that said underside (13) features an air

permeability of 78 to 107 liters/dm
2
 per minute.
The blanket as set forth in any of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that said top side (12) comprises a

coating, more particularly an aluminum coating,
reflecting thermal radiation. 
The blanket as set forth in any of the claims 1 to 5
characterized in that said hose inlet (14) consists of an

air-tight material suitable for washing and disinfection.
The blanket as set forth in any of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that said hose inlet (14) comprises a

connecting port (17) the throat of which is variable.
The blanket as set forth in claim 7, characterized in

characterized in that a reinforcement ply is provided at

the inner side of said inner cavity (11) opposite said
hose inlet (14).
The blanket as set forth in any of the claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that said outer edge (22) of said

blanket (10) is provided with a plurality of retaining
tapes (23a, 23b, 23c) spaced away from each other.
