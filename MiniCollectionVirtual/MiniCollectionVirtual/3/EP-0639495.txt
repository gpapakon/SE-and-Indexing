<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle brake lever mechanism having a bracket (14) 
mountable to a bicycle handlebar (15), a lever (13) mounted for pivotal 

movement to the bracket (14) and a brake cable connector (17) connected 
to 

the lever (13). The cable connector (17) is connected to the lever (13) 
via an 

adjusting mechanism (18) for so that the return position (R) of the brake 
lever relative to a lever bracket (14) may be adjusted to accommodate 

various sized hands. Further, the adjusting mechanism allows for 
adjustment of a lever ratio A which is defined mathematically by 

the distance between the pivot point (X) of the lever and the pivot 
point (F) of the cable connector on the lever divided by the distance 

from a set point (P) on the brake lever to the pivot point of the 
lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bicycle brake lever
mechanism, and more particularly to a brake lever mechanism with
adjusting means for changing the return or at rest position of a
brake lever relative to a lever mounting bracket or bicycle
handlebar, and the lever ratio of the brake lever relative to a
brake cable.The current bicycle market is such that for any one
bicycle model, there may be dozens of different types of people
who may purchase that model bicycle. For instance, there may be
amateur bicycle riders, professional riders, young adults, heavy
set men, petite women, all interested in the same model bicycle.
It is therefore desirable to provide ways to adjust a bicycle to
fit almost any type of rider to minimize the likelihood of
refitting specialized equipment on a standard bicycle. One such
adjustment relates to the brake mechanism on a bicycle. For
instance, a young teenager would not want a brake lever response
that requires an excessive amount of force in order to engage the
brakes on the bicycle, nor would a child want the return position
of the brake lever to be five inches away from the handlebar,
making in impossible to reach with small fingers. Similarly, an
adult with large strong hands would not want to have a brake 
lever with feather like action where the brakes lock up by the
mere touch of the brake lever. Nor would that same adult want
the brake lever to be so close to the handlebar that his or her
fingers would not fit between the lever and the handlebar.Adjustable bicycle brake lever mechanisms are well known,
such as that disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility Model
Law Application Publication SHO 62-28547. In this particular
reference, a bracket is mountable to the handlebar of a bicycle.
The lever bracket has a lever mounted to it via a pivot pin. The
pivot pin allows the lever to pivot with respect to the lever
bracket. The lever has wire locking means in the form of a u-shaped
bracket pivotally mounted to a portion of the lever but
spaced apart from the lever pivot pin. A brake cable is
connected at its first end to the u-shaped bracket on the lever.
The second end of the cable is connected to brake shoes which,
when engaged, stop the rotation of the bicycle wheels in a manner
known in the art.The wire locking means is mounted to the lever by a
second pivot pin, the second pin passing through an elongated
opening in the lever. The elongated opening allows for
adjustment of the position of the wire locking means with respect
to the pivot pin of the lever and
