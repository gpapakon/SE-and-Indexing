<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of sequencing two or more regions of target DNA wherein each of said regions is annealed to a different sequencing primer followed by DNA synthesis using a sequencing polymerase and sequencing nucleotides with subsequent size grading of the DNA so synthesised, each of said sequencing primers being provided with separate distinguishing and/or immobilisation means except that one of said sequencing primers may lack such means, whereby the populations of DNA synthesised from each DNA region may be distinguished and/or separated and a kit for carrying out such a method.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of sequencingThis invention relates to a method of simultaneous sequencing of two or more regions of DNA.There is an increasing demand for reliable sequencing of DNA, particularly in relation to the human genome project and the identification of DNA associated with pathological conditions. It is particularly desirable that such sequencing methods lend themselves to automation.Recently, many technical improvements have been reported, although the major contributions concern the data evaluation, i.e. computer software. A filter method to prepare single stranded phage DNA has been described (Kristnesen et al (1987)), which may be developed into an automated procedure. Attempts to develop automated sequencing reactions by a centrifugal reagent handling device have also been described (Martin et al (1985) ) as well as image processing programs for the detection of the bands on the radiograms (Elder et al (1985)). However, the most common approach has been to automate techniques with the aid of robots. Using such a strategy, systems for high-speed sequencing ( ada et al 1983)) and DNA template preparations (De Bonville et al 1987)) have been introduced.A novel approach to automize the electrophoresis step has been described by several groups (Smith et al (1986), Ansorge et al (1987) and Prober et al (1987)) taking advantage of fluorescence instead of isotopes for labelling the DNA fragments. With these systems on-line detection can be achieved, which makes it possible to combine the three operations electrophoresis, detection and data handling into a single automated station. Such systems are therefore being included in megabase sequencing strategies. 

 To obtain a completely automated sequencing protocol, it is therefore essential to also develop suitable automated methods for the first two operations (template preparation and sequencing reactions) .Solid phase methods have proven to be very useful in molecular biology, in areas such as peptide synthesis, peptide sequencing and DNA synthesis. A large number of instruments are commercially available utilizing this technique. The advantage with a solid phase approach is usually a combination of good yields, reproducible reactions and easy automation.At present there are, however, few reports on solid phase approaches to handling manipulatations of cloned DNA sequences for applications such as DNA sequencing reactions, site-directed manipulations of cDNA synthesis.

Claims
1. A method of sequencing two or more regions of target DNA wherein each of said regions is annealed to a different sequencing primer followed by DNA synthesis using a sequencing polymerase and sequencing nucleotides with subsequent size grading of the DNA so synthesised, each of said sequencing primers being provided with separate distinguishing and/or immobilisation means except that one of said sequencing primers may lack such means, whereby the populations of DNA synthesised from each DNA region may be distinguished and/or separated.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 for sequencing both strands of double stranded target DNA, in which said DNA is separated in solution into its two single strands and each strand is annealed to a different sequencing primer followed by DNA synthesis using a sequencing polymerase and sequencing nucleotides with subsequent size grading of the DNA so synthesised, one of said primers being provided with distinguishing or immobilisation means and the other primer lacking such means, or being provided with different distinguishing or immobilisation means, whereby the populations of DNA synthesised from each DNA strand may be distinguished and/or separated.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 in which said regions occur separately on the same DNA strand.
4. A method as claimed in claim 2 in which the strand separation is effected by heating and the sequencing polymerase is a thermostable polymerase.
5. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 in which said means for distinguishing comprise a fluorescent dye or a radionucleide. 


6. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 in which said means for immobilisation is biotin, a hapten or a protein-binding DNA sequence.
7. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6 in which both dideoxynucleotides and deoxynucleotides are present to produce said populations of DNA by chain stopping at different chain lengths.
8. A method as claimed in claim 7 in which the dideoxybases are labelled with different fluorescent dyes and the sequencing primers are provided with different immobilising means whereby DNA populations containing different primers may be separated and size- graded.
9. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which one or more of said primers carries both means for immobilisation and means providing a visual signal.
10. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the initial target DNA is subjected to amplification.
11. A method as claimed in claim 10 in which amplification and sequencing are effected simultaneously by carrying out PCR amplification using primers as defined in claim 1 in the presence of dideoxy nucleotides and deoxynucleotides.
12. A kit for carrying out the method as claimed in claim 1 comprising a first sequencing primer provided with distinguishing and/or immobilisation means, a second sequencing primer lacking such means or being provided with different distinguishing or immobilisation means, and optionally at least one of the following: 


one or more further sequencing primers provided with immobilisation or distinguishing means different from those of said first and second primers; a polymerase; deoxynucleotide triphosphates; dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (optionally labelled) ; sequencing buffer.
