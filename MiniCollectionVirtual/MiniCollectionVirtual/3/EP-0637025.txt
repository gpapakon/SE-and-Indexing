<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
for recording and reproducing digital data and a method 
for the same, and more particularly to an apparatus for 
recording blocked digital data on a magnetic tape and a 
method for the same. In recent years, various kinds of apparatuses 
for recording and reproducing digital data have been 
widely applied with the advancement of the technology 
for recording and reproducing digital data. As a 
record medium, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magnetic 
tape, and the like are used. Among them, the magnetic 
tape is more practical and superior in storage capacity, 
changeability, and price (in a unit cost of capacity), 
compared with other record media. Data to be recorded on a magnetic tape is 
mainly classified into two kinds of data: data transferred 
and recorded by a host such as a computer and 
data automatically added (additional data) by an apparatus 
for recording and reproducing. The additional 
data includes information concerning a leading edge and 
a trailing edge of a recording region on a magnetic 
tape, information concerning the delimitation of blocks 
formed therein, an address indicating the position 
therein, information for error detection or error 
correction, etc. It is convenient for the host to 
utilize information concerning a name, an attribute, a 
size, and the like of data during recording, reading,  
 
or searching for the data. Such information is referred 
to as management data in the present specification. The data transferred by the host is recorded 
after being divided into blocks having a predetermined 
size. For example, in the case of a usual computer, 
the data is divided so as to have 512 bytes per block. 
Each block is the minimum unit of the magnetic tape in 
which data can be recorded. Data divided into a predetermined 
size by the host is referred to as blocked 
data (herein, blocked data means a "blocked data" unit 
or "data block"). Thus, the blocked data becomes the 
minimum unit for recording on the magnetic tape. 
Furthermore, instructions (marks) for searching data 
can be recorded on the magnetic tape. The blocked data 
and marks can be recorded with respective numbers 
assigned thereto. Some blocked data can be combined to be 
recorded as grouped data (herein, grouped data means a 
"grouped data" unit or "data group"). Figure 34 shows 
an example of grouped data recorded by a conventional 
apparatus for recording and reproducing digital data. 
This example shows a DDS format using a digital audio 
tape-recorder
