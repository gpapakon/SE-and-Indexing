Method for the colorimetric determination of 
NAD(P)H or of an analyte which is a substrate of an 

enzyme which reacts to form NAD(P)H, by means of 
oxidation with a NAD(P)H-oxidizing enzyme in the 

presence of a direct chromogenic electron acceptor 
and determination of the reduced electron acceptor 

as a measure of the amount of NAD(P)H, wherein 
NAD(P)H is reacted with the enzyme benzyl alcohol 

dehydrogenase in the presence of a nitrosoaniline 
compound of the general formula I
