<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motorized, hand-held 
massaging apparatus having a rotating massage head. 
In order to maximize user comfort, the invention reduces 
the vibrations that are felt through the handle of the 
apparatus, on massagers having either rotating and non-rotating 
massage heads. It is known in the art to construct non-motorized, 
hand-held massagers with rotating massage heads. See 
United States Patents No. 2,213,356 (S. D. Dunlap), 
4,622,956 (Nesheim), 4,989,585 (Auker), Des. 182,123 
(Kaliski), Des. 276,652 (O'Brien et al.), Des. 285,724 
(Grundler et al.), and Des. 293,471 (Sato). These 
references disclose devices having various types of 
rotating massage heads, such as those having one or more 
rotatable or non-rotatable balls mounted on a shaft, a 
rotatable hub with a plurality of teeth located on the 
periphery of the hub and extending from the hub in a radial 
direction, and an ellipsoid with raised longitudinal 
fingers extending from end to end of the ellipsoid. It is also known to construct massagers containing 
motors. These motors are used to create vibratory or other 
motions in order to aid in the massage. Some massagers 
provide a massage from a non-rotating massage head. See 
United States Patent No. 4,722,326 (Ruderian). These  
 
devices may generate friction and discomfort when moved 
across the skin because the massage head must be dragged 
across the skin instead of rolled over it. Also, the 
constant vibration, at the same frequency, tends to produce 
an undesirable numbing effect on the hand holding the 
device. Other massagers provide a motorized massage with a 
rotating massage head in order to eliminate the need for 
lotions or oils to reduce friction. See United States 
Patents No. 1,958,936 (R. Bajette et al.), 2,988,084 (W. A. 
Douglas), 3,845,758 (Anderson), 3,994,290 (Springer et 
al.), 4116,233 (Scaduto), 4,565,189 (Mabuchi), and 
5,123,406 (Masuda). These devices generally comprise 
massagers with the motor located either in the handle, or 
in a massage head which is rigidly attached to the handle. 
This design also subjects the holder of such a device to 
continuous vibrations which may cause fatigue and 
discomfort. It is known in the art to use coil springs as 
a means of isolating the massage head from the handle. The art teaches the use of a heating element in a 
massager. See United States Patent No. 2,809,630 (W. 
Volker). The art, however, places the heating element 
within the massage head but not in contact with it. This 
design of a
