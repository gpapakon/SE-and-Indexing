<ABSTRACT>
In a line printer, a rotation shaft (9) of a platen (2) is utilized as a fulcrum 
of a head-up lever (4). The head-up lever (4) and a bearingof the platen (2) are made in 

an integral form. As a result, the total number of parts of the line printer can be reduced 
and total number of assembling steps can also be reduced. Positioning of a print head 

(3) with respect to the platen (2) is achieved by establishing a precise engagement 
between a first pin (20) integrally formed on the edge portion of the print head (3) and a 

first guide groove (18) formed on a side wall (7,8) of a frame. As a consequence, the 
correct positioning of the print head can be performed with respect to the platen (2). On 

the other hand, a second pin (21) of the print head is journalled under a floating 
condition by a scond guide groove (19) of the side (7,8) wall of the frame (1). This 

second pin (21) functions as a free fulcrum when the pressure contact of the print head 
(3) is released. As described above, play is formed at the free fulcrum of the head-up 

lever, so that distortion of parts and machining tolerance can be accommodated. Since 
the energizing force given to the print head (3) is performed by employing only one 

elastic member (14) around a centre of the platen (2) in the lengthwise direction, a so-called 
floating effect may be produced and eccentric abutting of the print head (3) and 

platen (2) can be avoided. The print head (3) is detachably assembled to the frame (1). 
The assembled print head (3) is held by a rear plate (12) which is similarly detachably 

engaged with the frame (1). The elastic member (14) is integrally assembled into the 
print head (2) together with the lock lever (17). As a result, the print head (3) can be 

simply assembled and can be easily replaced. Since the lock lever (17) is provided in 

order that the rear plate (12) is not easily accidentally removed, it is more possible that 
the print head is prevented from being dismounted when this is not desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a printer. More particularly, but not
exclusively, the present invention is directed to an easily assembled/replaceable print
head employed in a printer such as a line printer, and to an improved means for
moving the print head relative to a platen in the printer.Document EP-A-463595 discloses a printer comprising a frame having two
spaced apart side walls; a platen pivotally journalled between said both side walls in
which are provide guide grooves; and a print head assembled between both of said
side walls and positionable in pressure contact with said platen.Conventionally, a compact line printer is assembled by employing a frame
having a pair of side walls which are spaced apart from each other. The platen is
pivotally journalled on both the side walls. The print head, such as a thermal head or
the like, used to print out recording data received from an external source on
recording paper is provided in pressure contact with the platen in between both the
side walls. Further, the head-up lever is mounted on one of side walls to move the 
print head in order to release the pressure contact with the platen. Printing is
performed on the recording paper which is supplied between the platen and the print
head under the pressure contact condition. The recording paper may be replaced after
printing by releasing the pressure contact.The head-up lever is pivotally operated so as to release the pressure contact of
the print head against the platen. A conventional head-up lever is journalled to the pin
extending from one of the side walls of the frame. The pin must be fixed to the side
wall of the frame in order to mount the head-up lever. As a result, there is a
drawback in that the total number of parts or components of the printer and also the
number of assembling steps of the printer are increased.Further, conventionally, the print head is constructed so that it is mounted on a
shaft extending between the pair of side walls of the frame. As a consequence,
assembling the printer is complex and the replacement of the print head cannot be
easily performed during a repair operation.Moreover, it is technically difficult to precisely maintain the parallel
relationship between the platen and the print head. Therefore, there is another
problem in that coasting and the like of the recording paper may occur during the
printing operation. The present invention has been made in an attempt to solve the above-described
drawbacks of the conventional line printer, and in one
