<ABSTRACT>
The adjustment screw (2) which is displaced in translation by rotating a nut (9) with which it is engaged, is solidly attached to a part (3) comprising tongues (31-32, 31'-32') which are elastically deformable in the radial direction with respect to the axis (XX') of the screw, the wall (1) of the casing of the headlight being provided with bearing means such as longitudinal ribs (110-120, 111-121) designed to immobilise the part (3) in rotation while stressing the tongues in flexion so as to prevent play. Headlight equipment, in particular for a motor vehicle.

A device for immobilising in rotation, and without play, a 
screw (2 ; 5) for adjusting a headlamp reflector, the said screw 

(2 ; 5) being axially movable in translation relative to the wall 
(1 ; 7) of the headlamp casing, characterized in that it 

comprises at least one element (31, 32 : 60), permanently fixed 
to the screw (2 ; 5), which is resiliently deformable in the 

radial direction relative to the axis (XX') of the screw (2 ; 5), 
and in that the wall (1 ; 7) of the casing is equipped with means 

(110-111, 120-121 ; 125 ; 72) for bearing against and 
constraining the said element the means being shaped so that 

their engagement with the said resiliently deformable element 
(31, 32 ; 60) ensures the immobilisation in rotation, without 

play, of the said screw (2 ; 5). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
said resiliently deformable element is a flexible tongue (31, 32) 

or lug (60). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
wall (1 ; 7) of the casing comprises a tubular part (12 ; 7) the 

internal surface of which carries the said bearing means (120-121, 
125 ; 72). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
said bearing means consist of one or several protuberances such 

as ribs (120-121) or curved ridges (72). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
said bearing means consist of a fold in the wall (125) of the 

tubular part. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
screw (2) is equipped with at least one pair of flexible tongues 

(31, 32) extending like prongs of a fork parallel to - or almost 
parallel to - the axis (XX') of the screw and contained 

approximately in a plane (V) through which the said axis (XX') 
passes, whilst the wall (1) of the casing comprises two  

 
substantially coaxial tubular parts (11, 12) each of which 

comprises means (110, 120) for bearing against and constraining 
by flexion one of the tongues (31, 32). 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that, seen 
in the said plane (V) containing the tongues (31, 32), the latter 

converge slightly in the direction towards their free ends. 
A device according to claim 6 or claim 7, characterized in 
that, seen in projection in a plane (H), which is orthogonal to 

the said plane (V) containing the tongues (31, 32) and parallel 
to the axis (XX') of the screw, the said tongues diverge slightly 

in the direction towards their free ends. 
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that their free ends are tapered. 
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that the external tongue (32) is adapted to come 

to bear by one of its lateral surfaces against a bearing element 
(120, 125) carried by the external tubular part (12) whereas the 

internal tongue (31) is adapted to come to bear by its lateral 
surface situated on the opposite side against a bearing element 

(110) carried by the internal tubular part (11). 
A device according to claims 8 and 10 taken together, 

characterized in that the mutual separation (e) in a 
circumferential direction of the external (120) and internal 

(110) bearing elements corresponds substantially to the thickness 
of the tongues (31, 32) in such a manner that after assembly they 

are positioned in the same radial plane (V). 
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterized in that the said external tongue (32) and internal 

tongue (31) come to bear, respectively, the one (32), by its 
external edge, against the internal wall of the external tubular  

 
part (12) and the other, by its internal edge, against the 

external wall of the internal tubular part (11), and this causes 
them to come closer together on assembly as a result of a 

squeezing effect. 
A device according to claim 12, characterized in that at 
least one (31) of the tongues is equipped at its free end with 

a boss (34) by means of which it comes to bear against the wall 
of the tubular part (11) associated with it. 
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 13, 
characterized in that the screw (2) is equipped with two 

identical pairs of flexible tongues (31-32, 31'-32') arranged 
symmetrically on either side of its axis (XX'). 
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 14, 
characterized in that the internal tubular part (11) of the 

casing constitutes a sleeve inside which a control nut (9) is 
guided in rotation and immobilised in translation and the 

adjustment screw (2) engages in the said nut. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the said resiliently deformable elements 

consist of a set (6) of four identical flexible lugs (60), having 
a square cross-section, which prolong the free end of the screw 

(5) substantially parallel to its axis (XX'), and symmetrically 
relative to the latter, the internal faces of these lugs (60) 

being separated by gaps (64) which allow them to come towards one 
another by resilient flexion. 
A device according to claim 16, characterized in that the 
wall (7) of the casing comprises a tubular portion (70) having 

an approximately square cross-section in which the set (6) of 
lugs (60) engage and are constrained by flexion. 
A device according to claim 17, characterized in that the  
 

internal surface of the tubular portion (70) is equipped with a 
series of longitudinal curved ridges (72) which come to bear 

against the said lugs (60). 
A device according to claim 18, characterized in that a pair 
of curved ridges (72) is provided at each angle of the tubular 

portion, each ridge being located on one of the faces of the 
angle, at equal distances from the latter, and adapted to come 

to bear against the two external faces of the same lug (60). 
A device according to any one of claims 16 to 19, 
characterized in that the four lugs (60) diverge slightly towards 

their free ends in a symmetrical manner relative to the axis

nut (8), in which the adjustment screw (5) engages, is guided in 

rotation and immobilised in translation.
