<ABSTRACT>
Process and device for the analysis of eye movement in animals or humans. The device comprises first (3) and second (5) video cameras mounted on a spectacle frame (9) and rigidly linked to one another, and form part of a removable unit (16). Said first and second cameras are aimed at points in their respective scenes which are close. The technical field for the invention is that of the manufacture of a device for the measurement of eye movement.

Device for analysing the movement of the eye (2), 
comprising a first video camera (3) capable of delivering 

a first video signal (4) representative of an image (14) 
of the said eye, which device further comprises a second 

video camera (5) capable of delivering at least one 
second video signal (6) representative of an image (19) 

of a scene (7), which first camera (3) and second camera 
(5) are mounted on a spectacle frame (9), characterized 

in that the said first camera (3) and second camera (5) 
are mechanically rigidly connected together and form part 

of a removable module (16), and in that the said first 
camera (3) and second camera (5) have points of sight of 

their respective scenes which are close. 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the said 
first video camera (3) and second video camera (5) of the 

said module (16) have substantially merged, respective 
optical axes (XX1, XX2) and are mounted "head to tail". 
Device according to either one of Claims 1 and 2, 
in which the said spectacle frame (9) is provided, by 

fitting, with a second removable module for observation 
and/or analysis of the eye, comprising a single camera, 

and in which the said modules comprise means for lighting 
the eye with infrared light. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, in 

which the said spectacle frame (9) is provided with 
light-tight means so that the fitting of two modules on 

the said frame makes it possible to form in front of the 
patient's eyes a chamber which is tight to the outside 

visible light, which device comprises a module composed 
of a mask.  

 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, in 
which a removable module comprises a camera for observing 

and/or analysing the eye, comprises means for lighting 
the eye with infrared light, and comprises means for 

measuring the light intensity reflected by the eyeball. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
comprising means for digitalizing the said second video 

signal (6) and means for analysing digitalized scene 
images obtained, which analysing means comprise contour 

extraction means and comprise means for identifying at 
least one object appearing in the said scene image and 

comprise means for calculating coordinates of the said 
object. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, in 
which the said module (16) comprises a first matrix CCD 

sensor (10) and a second matrix CCD sensor (11), which 
first and second CCD sensors are identical and are 

located in two planes (17, 18) substantially parallel to 
each other, perpendicular to the said substantially 

merged optical axes of the said cameras, and symmetrical 
with respect to the said plane of symmetry (15), which 

planes (17, 18) and/or which CCD sensors are very close 
to one another. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
comprising means for synchronizing the said first and 

second video signals (4, 6) and means for multiplexing 
the said first and second video signals to form a first 

multiplexed video signal composed of an even frame and an 
odd frame, the said even frame being identical to the 

simultaneous frame of the said first video signal (or of 
the said second video signal), and the said odd frame 

being identical to the simultaneous frame of the said 
second video signal (or of the said first video signal, 

respectively). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, in 
which the said scene comprises at least one fixed or 

mobile contrasted mark, and the said device comprises 
means for projecting at least one light spot constituting 

the said mark.  
 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
comprising a portable emitter of radioelectric signals 

obtained from the said first and second video signals.
