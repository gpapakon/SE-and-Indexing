<ABSTRACT>
A multi-speed step-change transmission has an input shaft (11), a first and a second layshaft (13, 14) and an output shaft (15). The shafts (11, 13, 14, 15) are parallel to one another but are arranged so that only pairs are in a common plane. Arranged on the shafts 11, 13, 14 are gearwheels (20 to 24, 30 to 32, 40 to 44), which mesh with one another to form pairs. Selector sleeves (25, 33, 45) serve to rotationally connect one of the gearwheels (designed as freely revolving gears) of the pairs to the respective shaft (11, 13, 14) supporting it. The other gears of the pairs are designed as fixed gears. The input shaft (11) and the second layshaft (14), which is connected to the output shaft (15) by way of a gearwheel pair (40/50), each carry a selector sleeve (25, 45) which can be displaced in two selection directions for the engagement of either of two gears of the transmission (10). The first layshaft (13) carries a third selector sleeve (33). The third selector sleeve (33) can likewise be displaced in two selection directions and serves to engage either of two forward gears.

<CLAIMS>
A multiple gear stepped transmission comprising an 
input shaft (11), a first and a second intermediate shaft (13, 

14) and an output shaft (15), the shafts (11, 13, 14, 15) being 
arranged parallel to each other but are only in pairs arranged 

in common planes, wherein toothed wheels (20 through 24, 30 
through 32, 40 through 44) are arranged on the shafts (11, 13, 

14) and mesh with each other in pairs (20/30, 21/31, 22/42, 
23/43, 24/44, 30/41, 32/43), gearshift sleeves (25, 33, 45) 

being provided for individually connecting one each of the 
toothed wheels designed as loose wheels (23, 24, 30, 31, 41, 

42) within said pairs (20/30, 21/31, 22/42, 23/43, 24/44, 30/41, 
32/43) of toothed wheels with its respective supporting shaft 

(11, 13, 14) for establishing joint rotation therewith, whereas 
the respective other each of the toothed wheels within said 

pairs (20/30, 21/31, 22/42, 23/43, 24/44, 30/41, 32/43) are 
designed as fixed toothed wheels (20, 21, 22, 32, 43, 44), 

wherein, further, the input shaft (11) carries a first gearshift 
sleeve (25) being displaceable in two shift directions for 

alternatively engaging two forward gears, whereas the second 
intermediate shaft (14) being connected to the output shaft 

(15) via a pair (40, 50) of toothed wheels carries a second 
gearshift sleeve (45) being displaceable in two shift directions 

for alternatively engaging two further gears of the transmission 
(10), and whereas the first intermediate shaft ((13) carries 

a third gearshift sleeve (33), characterized in that the third 
gearshift sleeve (33) is displaceable in two shift directions 

and is adapted to alternatively engage two further forward gears.  
 
The transmission of claim 1, being designed as a five 
gear transmission having a synchronized reverse gear, characterized 

in that the first gearshift sleeve (25) is adapted to 
alternatively engage the third or the fourth gear, the second 

gearshift sleeve is adapted to alternatively engage the fifth 
gear or the reverse gear and the third gearshift sleeve (33) 

is adapted to alternatively engage the first or the second 
gear. 
The transmission of claim 2, characterized in that 
the loose toothed wheel (30) of the first gear meshes with the 

loose toothed gear (41) of the reverse gear.
