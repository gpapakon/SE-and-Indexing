<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides rapid, reproducible procedures for generating chromosome region-specific probes (CRSPs) for diagnostic and research applications. Region-specific probes are provided by direct in vitro enzymatic amplification (PCR) of microdissected chromosomal or hyridized DNA from the chromosomal region of interest, followed by labelling for in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. CRSP specificity can be further enhanced using a linker-based strategy, wherein linkered DNA (LDNA) sequences prepared from DNA libraries are hybridized to chromosomal DNA in situ, microdissected from the chromosomal region of interest and then directly amplified using the linker as primer. These procedures make it possible to generate a vast number of chromosome region-specific probes without microchemical manipulation after dissection and provide means for identifying cryptic chromosomal alterations previously not amenable to routine cytogenetic analysis. Probes generated by the methods of the present invention can also be used for screening any DNA library of interest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to chromosome region-specific probes
(CRSPs) and their preparation and use. More specifically the present invention relates
to a rapid, reproducible method of generating chromosome region-specific probes
through direct amplification of microdissected chromosomal DNA and DNA hybridized
thereto, the probes generated thereby and methods of their use.The identification and analysis of chromosome abnormalities is of great clinical
and research importance. Chromosome abnormalities are a significant cause of
congenital malformation and are responsible for at least half of spontaneous abortions
or miscarriages. Hassold, T., Trends Genet. 2:105 (1986); deGrouchy, J. et al.,
Clinical Atlas of Human Chromosomes (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2d ed, 1984);
Gardner, R. et al., Chromosome Abnormalities and Genetic Counseling (Oxford Univ.
Press, New York, 1989); Gelehrter, T. et al. Principals of Medical Genetics (Williams
& Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 1990) pp. 159-189. The analysis of recurring chromosome
abnormalities in malignant cells has also become an integral part of the diagnostic
and prognostic workup of many human cancers. Heim, S. et al., Cancer Cytogenetics
(A. Uss, New York, 1987); Sandberg, A., The Chromosomes in Human Cancer and
Leukemia (Elsevier, New York, 1990); Trent, J. et al., NEJM 322:1508 (1990). In
addition to these clinical applications, the molecular examination of chromosome
abnormalities has facilitated the identification of genes related to the pathogenesis of
both hereditary diseases and cancer. Haluska, F. et al., Ann. Rev. Genet 21:321
(1987); Weinberg, R., J. NIH Res. 3:45 (1991); Nowell, P. et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol.,
94:229 (1990); Rowley, J., Cancer Res. 50:3816 (1990); Fearon, E. et al., Cell 61:759
(1990); Fountain, J., Science 244:1085 (1989). Current cytogenetic techniques for chromosome analysis are not, however,
entirely satisfactory. One major technical limitation is their inability to unequivocally
characterize all cytologically recognizable chromosome rearrangements. For example,
amniocentesis may reveal unidentifiable de novo unbalanced translocations or
unknown supernumerary marker chromosomes. Warburton, D., J. Hum. Genet. 49:995
(1991); Callen, D. et al., Am J. Hum. Genet. 48:769 (1991). Likewise, in many human
cancers, particularly solid tumors, the presence of unidentifiable marker chromosomes
or unidentifiable unbalanced translocations frequently prevents complete karyotypic
analysis. Mitelman, F., Catalog of Chromosome

hybridized LDNA; and
(e) directly amplifying LDNA from the isolated region, the step of
amplifying further comprising the step of:
