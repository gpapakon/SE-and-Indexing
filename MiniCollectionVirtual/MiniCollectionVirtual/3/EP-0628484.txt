<ABSTRACT>
1. A packaging element for trays having openings and an edge flange and fitted with pipette tips intended to be placed in an autoclave, consisting of a cardboard wrapping which encloses the trays and has a hinged lid, in which packaging the trays are provided with a peripheral edge flange (8) and the cardboard wrapping (4) is provided with a hinged lid (5, 6) disposed on the top side and on the underside, the cardboard wrapping having a height which corresponds approximately to the length of a pipette tip plus the thickness of a tray, and a spacer frame being provided in the cardboard wrapping, which frame serves to place the trays (2) on and has a length and width falling slightly below the corresponding internal dimensions of the edge flange (8) of the trays (2) and such a height that the unit formed from a spacer frame and trays (2) placed on both sides has a height which corresponds to the height of the cardboard wrapping. The lid flaps are attached to two diagonally opposite edges of the cardboard wrapping, the walls (10) of the cardboard wrapping bearing the lid flaps (5, 6) having a height which is reduced by the height of one tray and being provided on the attachment edge with a finger-hole cutout.
