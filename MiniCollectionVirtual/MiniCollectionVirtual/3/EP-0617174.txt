<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for spraying a pressurised fluid, comprising, on the one hand, a fixed connector which emerges outside the device and is capable of receiving the end of a pipe for supplying the pressurised fluid and, on the other hand, an element which rotates about a vertical axis and is fitted with at least one nozzle for spraying the fluid. The said nozzle (10, 11) is mounted so as to pivot freely about a substantially vertical axis on the said rotating element (12'), and a hose (flexible conduit) (9) directly connects the fixed connector (8) to the nozzle (10, 11). The invention also relates to a machine for cleaning surfaces, especially roadways.
