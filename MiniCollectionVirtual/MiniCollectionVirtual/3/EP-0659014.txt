<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid state image sensing device and to a
method for transferring charges in a solid state image sensing device. The
invention is applicable to a solid state image sensing device of multiline CCD
(charge coupled device) register structure.EP-A-0 553 869 describes a known solid state image sensing device of CCD
type and a known method of transferring charges.Recently, with the advent of higher resolution and higher speed image
reading devices, a multiline CCD image sensor has become known as an image
sensor suitable for the image reading devices. An example of this image sensor is
composed of photoelectric transfer elements arranged in a straight line (each
element of which corresponds to one pixel), a shift register, two-stage charge
transfer sections (registers) composed of a plurality of CCDs, and an output section
(buffer).The signal charges generated by the photoelectric transfer elements are
transferred to the charge transfer section via a shift gate at a predetermined timing
and further transferred to the output section at another predetermined timing for
conversion into voltage signals.In this multiline CCD register structure, however, where defects exist in the
charge transfer paths between the initial stage register and the succeeding stage
register, charges tend to remain behind when being transferred between these
registers. These residual charges cause image defects. In addition, there is a
tendency for a constant magnitude of charge to remain only when the signal charge
exceeds a predetermined level.Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows the relationship between the
signal charge generated by the photoelectric transfer section and the output charge
outputted after transfer between the two registers, in which 1 denotes the normal
charge, 2 denotes the abnormal charge excluding the remaining charge, and 3
denotes the abnormal charge including the remaining charge. As shown in Fig. 1,
when the magnitude of the signal charge is small, the relationship between the two 
has non-linear characteristics, so that it becomes difficult to correct the signal
charges through signal processing.It is the object of the present invention to provide a solid state image sensing
device of multiline CCD structure, which can correct the signal output easily even if
residual charges exist during charge transfer between registers or can apparently
eliminate the residual charges.According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a solid state
image sensing device
