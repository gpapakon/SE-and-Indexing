<ABSTRACT>
A molded reflective optical waveguide module is 
provided. A molded first optical portion (111) having a first 

surface (112) or a major surface is formed. A core region 
(113) having a first end (114) and a second end (116) is 

disposed into the first surface (112) of the molded first 
optical portion (111) with the first end (114) of the core 

region (113) terminating in a surface (119) having an angle 
(121). A second molded optical portion (126) having electrical 

traces (131) and photonic devices (141, 142) can be applied to 
the molded first optical portion (111).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, generally, to optics, and more 
particularly, to coupling of optical devices, as well as coupling 
of an optical device to an optical fiber. At present, coupling of optical signals or light signals to 
optical elements, such as photonic devices, optical fibers, and 
waveguides sometimes requires changing the direction of the 
optical signals and directing the optical signals toward the 
optical elements. Presently, in the case of a waveguide, the 
waveguide is cut or cleaved at an angle that is precise so as to 
provide a surface. The surface typically is either coated with a 
reflective material or a reflective optical element such as a 
mirror is attached to the surface. However, waveguides are not 
easily cleaved or cut at precise angles, thus the precise angle 
is generally compromised. With the angle being compromised, 
the reflective material or the mirror that is applied or 
attached to the surface is not capable of reflecting the light 
signals in an optimum direction, thus not allowing optimal 
coupling from the surface to the optical element or elements. Further, in an attempt to increase precision, alignment 
and optimization of coupling between the light signals and 
other optical elements is typically achieved by hand. The use 
of hand methods or semiautomatic methods to align and to 
optimize light signals directed to other optical elements 
increases cost and does not allow for mass production of this 
type of coupling between light signals and optical elements. Additionally, coupling of photonic devices and optical 
fibers requires reflecting the optical signals from the photonic 
device to the optical fiber. Generally, this coupling is achieved 
as previously described herein above, but further is 
complicated by not only the alignment and optimization of the 
reflective surface but also the alignment and optimization of  
 
the optical fiber to the waveguide. As previously described, 
both of these alignments and optimizations are achieved by 
hand, thus making the cost of manufacturing extremely high, as 
well as not allowing the coupling of these optical elements to 
be achieved in high volume manufacturing environments. By now it should be apparent, that the presently used 
coupling methods for connecting light signals to a variety of 
optical elements have severe problems that severely limit 
their use in a production environment. Further it should be 
pointed out that alignment of optical fibers and reflective 
materials or surfaces with waveguides
