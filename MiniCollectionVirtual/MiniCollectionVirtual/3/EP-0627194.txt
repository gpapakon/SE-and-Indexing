<ABSTRACT>
A leadless implantable cardiac arrhythmia alarm is 
disclosed which continuously assesses a patient's heart 

function to discriminate between normal and abnormal heart 
functioning and, upon detecting an abnormal condition, 

generates a patient-warning signal. The alarm (5) is capable of 
sensing impedance measurements of heart, respiratory and 

patient motion and, from these measurements, generating an 
alarm signal when the measurements indicate the occurrence 

of a cardiac arrhythmia. Because it requires no external 
leads or feedthrough connectors, the hermetically-sealed 

patient alarm (5) is minimally invasive and results in reduced 
trauma to a patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chronically implantable 
cardiac emergency warning alarm, and to a method of 
operating such an alarm. More particularly, it relates to 
an alarm and a method for continuously assessing a patient's 
heart function to discriminate between normal and abnormal 
heart functioning and, upon detecting an abnormal condition, 
for generating a patient-warning signal. Ventricular arrhythmias are potentially lethal. In the 
instance of chaotic, non-coordinated cardiac contraction, 
known as fibrillation, death may occur within minutes. For 
patients who have survived an episode of ventricular fibrillation, 
there is a high probability of recurrence. In 
addition, patients who have experienced sustained symptomatic 
ventricular tachycardia are at risk in that such arrhythmias 
may convert to fibrillation. It is these patients who 
may benefit from an implantable cardioverter or defibrillator. Many patients are afflicted with cardiac disease such 
that a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia is possible, 
but not sufficiently likely to warrant the trauma, 
inconvenience and costs associated with an implanted anti-arrhythmia 
device. These patients may be better served by 
an alarm device which warns of the occurrence of an arrhythmia 
but does not apply therapy to the heart. Thus, when the 
alarm detects an arrhythmia condition and emits a warning 
signal, the patient may seek medical assistance. Such an alarm device may also benefit patients having 
an implanted cardioverter or defibrillator. In these patients, 
an implantable cardiac condition alarm provides an 
early warning alarm signal so that the patient may take 
precautionary steps to reduce the threat associated with 
sudden incapacity due to an arrhythmia condition. For  
 
example, when ventricular fibrillation occurs, a patient 
commonly reaches an unconscious state within five to fifteen 
seconds following the onset of fibrillation due to lack of 
oxygen to the brain. If such a patient experiences ventricular 
fibrillation while performing an activity, such as 
standing or driving an automobile, a warning signal may 
allow the patient to take an appropriate action to avoid the 
consequences of becoming suddenly unconscious. Thus, a 
patient is alerted to the onset of a cardiac abnormality to 
terminate a risky activity or to obtain medical attention 
when it becomes practical. U.S. Patent No. 4,295,474, entitled "Recorder with
