<ABSTRACT>
An emulsion composition is described which comprises (a) 
an alkenylated silicone resin, (b) an alkenyl polydiorganosiloxane, 

(c) a silicone resin bearing SiH groups and (d) water. 
The emulsion composition may be combined with a precious metal 

catalyst to provide an emulsion release coating composition. 
The emulsion release coating composition may be applied to a 

substrate, for example paper, and cured thereon to provide an 
adhesive coating. Separation of a laminate formed from a 

substrate coated with said emulsion release coating composition 
and a adhesive coated article requires a relatively high 

delamination force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to silicone emulsion
compositions. In particular the invention relates to
silicone emulsion compositions which can be used in or as
release coating compositions.Silicone emulsion compositions, e.g. those which are
curable by a hydrosilylation reaction are used as release
coatings on substrates, for example paper, for
the purpose of preventing adhesion which may occur between
laminates of coated substrates and adhesive coated
articles.A release coating which allows a coated substrate to
separate from an adhesive coated article with the application
of only a small force, i.e. a release coating which
exhibits a low release force, is referred to in the art as
a premium release coating (e.g. EP-A-0 385 342).For many applications in the paper coating industry
and in particular in the field of laminates, wherein
adhesive coated articles, e.g. sticky labels,
are laminated with coated substrates, e.g. siliconised
backing paper, higher release forces are required than
those obtainable from premium release coatings. Accordingly,
additives have been developed which increase the
release force of such coatings. The release force
increasing additives are often referred to in the art as
controlled release additives.Controlled release additives known in the art
comprise vinylated silicone resins and are generally
effective at increasing the release force of premium
release coatings. However, the release force of release
coatings containing such additives tend to be unpredictable 
and fluctuate unreliably depending on the speed at which a
coated substrate is peeled or delaminated from an adhesive
material.For applications in the paper coating industry and in
particular in the field of laminates, it is desirable that
the release force of a release coating should be predictable
over a range of delamination speeds. Further, the
release force should be sufficiently low to allow ease of
delamination, but not so low as to allow accidental
delamination, for example during storage or handling.Additionally, the adhesive coated article, once
delaminated from a coated substrate, should retain its
adhesive properties.It is one of the objects of the present invention to
provide an improved emulsion composition for use in
providing release coating compositions.The invention provides in one of its aspects an
emulsion composition comprising (a) an alkenylated silicone
resin, (b) an alkenyl polydiorganosiloxane, (c) a silicone
resin bearing SiH groups and (d) water.An emulsion composition according to the invention
