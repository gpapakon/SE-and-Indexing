<DESCRIPTION>
 Template for treatment tools and method for the treatment of osseous structuresThe invention is directed to a template for treat¬ ment tools for the treatment of osseous structures and a method for the definition and reproduction of the positional relationship of a treatment tool rel¬ ative to an osseous structure.Using image producing methods such as computertomo- graphy and computer-based image-processing systems, it is possible to record osseous structures of the living organism in slices by a non-invasive tech¬ nique, to reconstruct them three-dimensionally and to visualize them through an output medium. Further, such systems frequently permit already a three-di¬ mensional planning of surgical interventions with regard to incisions, drilling, puncture, positioning of individual implants or other surgical interven¬ tions. Intraoperatively, i.e. during the actual sur- 

gical procedure, there often occur orientation prob¬ lems because no adequate technical means exist for a consequent, exact three-dimensional transfer of the steps of the intervention which have been planned with a waste of technical support. Therefore, the accuracy of execution depends exclusively on the experience, the three-dimensional perceptivity and the technical skill of the surgeon, which, depending on the type and the anatomical site of the interven¬ tion can involve extreme risks even with experienced surgeons. Generally, only freehand-guided instru¬ ments, two-dimensional tomographic images and pre- or intraoperative X-ray images are available.For some interventions, standard tool guides have been provided. These are mostly cutting, boring or sinking templates for preparing and/or fixing the seat of a knee or hip joint prosthesis (as e.g. US 4,567,885, US 4,703,751, US 4,822,362, US 4,721,104, DE-33 39 259, EP 380 451, EP 415 837, EP 231 885, EP 228 339, DE 39 25 488, DE 79 14 280) or for reposi¬ tioning osteotomies in the region of the proximal head of the femur or tibia (e.g. US 4,565,191, DE 38 42 645, DE 32 11 153). The intraoperative posi¬ tioning of these templates relative to the bone is performed free-handed and even in case of special solutions allowing limited adaptation to the anatom¬ ical conditions, as e.g. in US 4,846,161, DE 34 47 163 or DE 40 16 704, can generally not be car¬ ried out exactly and clearly according to the plan¬ ning of the intervention. In some approaches, intra¬ operative measurement and positioning under X-ray control are provided. This causes an increased expo-

Claims
A method for the definition and reproduction of the positional relationship of a treatment tool or a treatment or measuring device relative to an osseous structure for orthopedic surgery, wherein
- the osseous structure (17) is reconstructed,
- on the basis of said reconstruction of the os¬ seous structure (17), contact points and/or contact faces (1) are defined as abutment points for a mechanically rigid template (4) for guiding and aligning the treatment tool or the treatment or measuring device, said con¬ tact points and/or contact faces (1) being selected in such a manner that the template (4), when mounted on the osseous structure (17), abuts the osseous structure (17) in form-closed manner in exactly one spatially uniquely defined position,
- the spatial position of the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device relative to the osseous structure (17) is defined,
- corresponding to the previously defined posi¬ tion of the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device, fastening means are provided on or in the template (4), for fastening and/ or guiding the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device on the template (4),
- the template (4), having thus been defined with respect to its interfaces with the osse¬ ous structure (17) on the one hand, and the 


 treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device on the other hand, is produced, and
- the template (4), provided with the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device, is positioned on the osseous structure (17) on the contact points and/or contact faces (1) defined on the basis of the reconstruction of the osseous structure (17).
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that said reconstruction is performed on the basis of data which are obtained by non-invasive detection of the geometry of the osseous struc¬ ture (17).
A template for alignment, positioning and guid¬ ance of treatment tools, treatment or measuring devices for treatment of an osseous structure, comprising
- a template body (6) comprising abutment points adapted to selected contact points and/or con¬ tact faces (1) of the osseous structure (17) for form-closed abutment on said contact points and/or contact faces (1) of the osseous structure (17),
- the template body (6) copying the surface of the osseous structure (17) as a whole or by segments, but at least by three intraoper¬ atively uniquely definable abutment points, in such a manner that the template body (6) can be mounted on the osseous structure (17) in form-closed manner exclusively in exactly one spatially uniquely defined position, and 


 - fastening means for fastening the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device to the template body (6) in such a manner that the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device, when the abutment points of the tem¬ plate body (6) are in abutment with the con¬ tact points and/or contact faces of the osse¬ ous structure (17), is in a reproducible de¬ fined orientation relative to the osseous structure (17).
4. The template according to claim 3, characterized in that the template body (6) comprises guide means for limiting-the movement of the treatment tool, the treatment or measuring device for treatment of the osseous structure (17).
5. The use of a device for non-invasive tomographic imaging of osseous structures, particularly the use of computer or nuclear spin tomographic de¬ vices, for reconstruction of an osseous struc¬ ture (17) in order to produce a template (4) mountable in form-closed manner onto the osseous structure (17), for mounting and/or guidance of treatment tools, treatment and/or measuring de¬ vices for treatment of the osseous structure (17).
6. A method for the treatment of osseous structures in orthopedic surgery, wherein
- the osseous structure (17) is reconstructed,
- on the basis of said reconstruction of the os¬ seous structure (17), contact points and/or 


contact faces (1) are defined as abutment points for a template (4) for guiding and aligning a treatment tool, said contact points and/or contact faces (1) being selected in such a manner that the template (4), when moun
