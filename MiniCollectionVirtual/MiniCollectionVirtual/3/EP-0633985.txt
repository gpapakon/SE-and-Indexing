<CLAIMS>
Rolling bearing (1), for a, in particular, linear movement of a carrier (2) along 
a guide rail (6), said rolling bearing comprising pairs of rolling element circuits 

supported on raceways (5, 5a) on the carrierr (2) and the guide rail (6), a head 
piece (8) comprising a region (9) for deflecting the rolling elements (4) being 

arranged at each of the two front ends (7) of the carrier (2), and at least one of 
said head pieces (8) comprising a canal (10) for feeding lubricant to the rolling 

elements (4), 
characterized in that
 one single separate lubricant duct (13) 
comprising valve-like radial openings (16, 21, 23) for lubricant exit is inserted 

into the canal (10) of the head piece (8). 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lubricant duct 
(13) has a substantially U-shaped cross-section (24) and its side wall which 

forms an opening (14) bears against the carrier (2) via contact surfaces (26). 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lubricant duct 
(13) is made of an elastic and/or polymeric material. 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the lubricant 
duct (13) is made of a light-weight material. 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the contact 
surfaces (26) of the lubricant duct (13) which bear against the carrier (2) are 

configured as double elastic sealing lips (15) which, in the regions of intended 
lubricant exit merge with single elastic sealing lips (16). 
Rolling bearing according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 each of the 
lubricant exit regions of the lubricant duct (13) is arranged in a region of the 

raceway (5) of the carrier (2).  
 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the radial 
openings (14) of the lubricant duct (13) are made in the form of slits (21) 

situated each one in a region of the raceway (5) of the carrier (2). 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lubricant duct 
has a substantially annular cross-section (22). 
Rolling bearing according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the lubricant duct 
(13) comprises slits (23) which extend at a slant to its centre line and are 

situated in raceway regions (5) of the carrier (2). 
Rolling bearing according to claim 1 or 8, 
characterized in that
 the 
lubricant duct (13) is sealed at both its ends (17).
