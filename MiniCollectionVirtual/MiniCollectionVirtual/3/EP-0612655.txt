<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a system for the casting of 
anchors meant for the mooring of floating oil producing 

and/or drilling platforms, for which an anchor laying craft 
is used, whose general arrangement consists of a deck with 

wells for anchors, a capstan for dealing with chains, cable 
drums of an improved kind, lockers for the stowing of chains 

built into the underside of the deck of the craft, which are 
led by a capstan from such lockers or back to them, along 

hawsepipes, and drums for winding cables, mounted on a bed. 
When a floating platform is being moored, an improved laying 

device is used which prevents any slipping or dropping after 
each platform chain has been fas
tened to the previously laid 
line whenever the latter has to be lowered to its place in 

the sag. The invention also provides an improved line 
fisher.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a system for the casting of 
anchors intended to moor floating drilling and producing oil 
rigs, for which an anchor casting unit is used that is 
specially designed to store all the material usually kept on 
the platform for such purpose. Such unit is equipped to 
enable anchors and cables to be cast beforehand continuously, 
to enable line tautness tests to be carried out, and to 
enable cables to be fastened to platform chains when the 
platform is being positioned. The conventional method of mooring floating offshore 
drilling and production platforms, particularly when intended 
for use in deep waters, uses a combination of chains and 
large gauge cables, which means that platforms must be 
provided with storage space and heavy-lift cranes to handle 
them. Usually at least eight mooring lines are needed, and 
two main winches are needed for each mooring line. Some 
examples of systems most used are described in FR-A-2208373, 
US-A-3985093, US-A-3967572 and US-A-4722293. Though the best optimised of known systems is the one 
described above, they have one very great defect when they 
are used for production platforms. Once a production platform has been put into place it 
will not be moved again for the next 10 or 15 years, which 
means that the equipment is hardly being used at all, and if 
so then only very occasionally, thereby rendering it highly 
expensive. To this fact must be added the drop in cargo-carrying 
capacity, the loss of deck space, and the loss of 
compartment room, etc., amongst other things. In the conventional system the chains, cables and 
anchors are stored on board the platform and they are dropped 
by transferring the anchor, already fastened to its chain, 
into a special kind of tug with the aid of a device known as 
an anchor chaser tied to a tug hawser. After such transfer 
the tug travels away from the platform to wherever it has  
 
been agreed upon beforehand that the anchor is to be dropped, 
thereby towing the chain that the windlass on the platform 
has released. After an agreed length of chain has been paid out, if 
the system is not of the continuous kind the chain is tied to 
the steel cable (on the platform) and work goes ahead, this 
time with the aid of the capstan for the cable whereupon, at 
the spot where the anchor is to be taken hold, it is lowered 
and the chaser retrieved. To do this requires a very strong 
tug, able to make its way against the weight of the anchor 
and the sag of the cable and chain. It is a big disadvantage of

<CLAIMS>
A platform-mooring process, characterised by the 
following steps:- recovering, with the aid of laying craft, 

standby buoy, and chain windlass, the line to be dealt with 
and fastening an auxiliary cable thereto; shifting the 

laying craft towards the platform while laying auxiliary 
cable, and picking up close to the platform the end of the 

second part of the platform chain which is fastened to the 
laying craft chain, where one joins the other, with the aid 

of a triple link; after fastening is finished, laying a 
suitable length of chain from the platform while the laying 

craft starts to pick up the laid cable, up to where fastening 
of such cable to the line rises to the level of the working 

platform, and locking the cable capstan drum; fastening 

triple links of the chain and cable, respectively, lying more 
or less at the same level, such fastening being effected by 

introducing a small length of chain together with a laying 
device which helps in the lowering of the fastened line down 

to its place in the sag; after completion of the fastening, 
transferring the weights of chain and cable to the laying 

device, unfastening chain from the laying craft and from the 
links of the auxiliary cable and tying auxiliary cable to 

said laying device and transferring the weight of the laying 
device to the auxiliary cable, releasing said laying device 

from the means used to support it, lowering the line down to 
its level in the sag, and recovering said laying device. 
A platform mooring process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said laying device consists of a 

support base; and a sheave crown which fits on said support 
base by means of a spindle, said crown having notches in its 

lateral flanges to act as guides for breakable ropes which 
are fixed, at one end, into a common lug, and then in the 

middle of the ropes are moved away by a guide mounted on said 
spindle, and which at the other end are held by individual 

turnbuckles, said breakable ropes enabling links of chain to 
be tied to said sheave crown at different angles.  

 
A platform mooring process according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that displacement of the anchor in order 

to regularly check or replace any item in the mooring line is 
effected with the aid of said laying craft, said line being 

hoisted at the fastening of the second part of the chain from 
the platform to the cable (middle part) by means of a line 

fisher. 
A platform mooring process according to claim 3, 
characterised in that said line fisher consists of a sheave 

and crown fixed by means of a spindle which passes through a 
body a part of which is reinforced in the shape of an 

inverted groove; and in that said body has a front part 
which is more open in order to guide the chain, and a back 

part having a guiding nozzle and stop which prevents a triple 
link of the chain from passing through said guiding nozzle. 
A platform mooring process according to claim 3 or 
4, characterised in that said line fisher lies in a second 

part of the platform chain, below fenders lying at the water 
line of said platform and fastened to the platform by a 

hanging cable. 
Laying device for lowering anchoring lines in a 
platform mooring device characterised by 

consisting of a support base (42); and a sheave crown (43) 
which fits on said support base by means of a spindle, said 

crown having notches (45) in its lateral flanges to act as 
guides for breakable ropes (46) which are fixed, at one end, 

into a common lug (47), and then in the middle of the ropes 
are moved away by a guide (48) mounted on said spindle, and 

which at the other end are held by individual turnbuckles, 
said breakable ropes enabling links of chain to be tied to 

said sheave crown at different angles.
