<ABSTRACT>
A work loading and unloading device (3) disposed in front of a bending machine 
(1) and comprising a unit composed of a 5-axis control robot (5) provided with a 

work hand (43) at an end thereof, as well as of a single-work taking-up device (7) 
for taking up only a single work (W) from stacked works. The work loading and 

unloading device is movable to any desired positions and provided with a work 
hand (43) having a double-work take-up detecting device (83) and an upper hand 

able to approach a bent work without interference with the punch P.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a work loading and unloading device for a
bending machine
according to the preamble of claim 1 (see for example
JP-A-3118921),
and more specifically to a device for loading work to a bending
machine such as a press brake and further for unloading the bent work from the
same bending machine.In the conventional work loading and unloading device for loading work to
a bending machine such as a press brake and further for unloading out the bent
work from the bending machine, a robot of 6-axis control is fixedly arranged on
the front side of a single bending machine, independently. In addition, the upper
and lower hands attached to a work hand of the robot are openable to both sides.In the above-mentioned conventional device, however, the cost of the
robot itself is high and a long program preparation and teaching time (i.e., the
setup time) are needed. In addition, since the conventional work loading and
unloading device must be arranged for each bending machine separately, it is
troublesome to use the same work loading and unloading device for the other
bending machines.In the case where a small-sized work is clamped by the work hand and
brought into contact with the back gage the work hand interferes with a die, before
the work is brought into contact with the back gage. Further, when the already bent
work is to be clamped by the work hand, it is possible that the latter interferes with
the die and that consequently the moving stroke of the work hand must be reduced.
Another drawback of the known device consists in the fact that the double-work
taking-up must be detected on the work loading device side, so that it takes a
relatively long time to detect the double work taking-up. With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the primary object of the
present invention to provide a work loading and unloading device for a bending
machine, which is low in cost and short in time required for program preparation
and teaching time (setup time), and which can be arranged and located at needs in
front of a desired bending machine. Further, the work loading and unloading
device should be provided with a work hand which can clamp even small works
without interfering with the die and further can detect easily double-work
taking-up.The above-mentioned primary object is achieved by a work loading and
unloading device for a bending machine
as defined in claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment,
a plurality of centering heads are disposed below and at roughly a
middle portion of the
