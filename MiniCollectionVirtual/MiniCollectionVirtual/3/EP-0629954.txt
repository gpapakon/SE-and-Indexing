<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to telecommunication equipments and more 
particular to an adapter for transferring blocks of data of 
variable size to other adapters which are all connected to a 
main system bus. With the advent of the digital high-speed communication 
networks, the transport and processing of multimedia 
information, including data, images and sound, has been made 
possible. However, when considering the internal structure of the 
telecommunicatio equipments which are intended to handle such 
composite information, it appears particularly difficult to 
adapt the structure of the telecommunication equipment, 
basically formed of different adapters communicating together 
via a main system bus; so that it becomes possible, and easy, to 
handle blocks of data of different sizes fitting with the nature 
of the information (image, sound, ...) to be transmitted. The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide 
a high speed multimedia bus to which are connected multiple 
communicating adapters, and which allows one adapter to exchange 
data with another adapter card having a variable size. This problem is solved by the adapter according to the present 
invention for transferring blocks of data having a variable size  
 
to at least one destination adapter, each of the adapters being 
plugged in a respective slot and connected together via a main 
system bus under control of a central backplane card providing 
the arbitration process. In accordance with the present 
invention, each adapter comprises:
 
provided by means of: 
means for reading the slot identification characterizing the 
physical location where said transmitting adapter was plugged, 
means for generating a REQUEST word to be transmitted to said 
central backplane card via the system bus in order to request 
the access to the system bus, said REQUEST word being 
characteristic of the slot identification which was previously 
read; means for detecting an ACK acknowledge word generated by said 
central backplane having processed all the REQUEST words which 
were generated by the different adapters connected to the bus, 
said ACK word characterizing a particular adapter which is 
granted the access to said system bus; means operative in response to the detection of said ACK 
acknowledge word giving the access to the bus, for generating a 
signalling word to be transmitted to a particular destination 
adapter which will actually receive said transmitted data, said 
signalling word comprising information characterizing the type
