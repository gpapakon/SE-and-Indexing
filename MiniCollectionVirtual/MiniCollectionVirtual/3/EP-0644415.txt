<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for detecting the presence of charged 
particulate matter in the exhaust line of a semiconductor 

processing system includes at least two electrodes (10, 12) 
mounted in the exhaust line. A high voltage power supply 

(16) maintains an electric field nearly equal to the 
breakdown field between the first and the second electrodes 

(10, 12). When charged particulate matter (14) passes 
through the electric field between the two electrodes (10, 

12), the electric field is perturbed so that a transient 
current pulse flows in a circuit coupled to the two 

electrodes (10, 12). A pulse current monitoring circuit 
(18) detects the transient current associated with the 

passage of the charged particulate matter (14). In some 
circumstances, it is necessary to precharge the exhausted 

particulate matter before passing it by the electrodes (10, 
12).

<DESCRIPTION>
Recently, there has been considerable interest in the use of particle 
monitoring systems within semiconductor processing equipment. Monitoring 
the level of particulates present in semiconductor processing equipment can 
provide useful information regarding the processing of semiconductor 
wafers. For example, elevated particulate levels in the exhaust line of a 
plasma deposition system may be associated with certain contamination 
problems that can cause reduced yields. As such, a particle monitoring 
system may be useful either as a tool for process development or as an in 
situ process monitoring tool. One application of a particle monitoring system 
in semiconductor processing equipment is described in U.S. Patent No. 
5,083,865 entitled "Particle Monitor System and Method," owned by the 
assignee of the present invention, the disclosure of which is hereby 
incorporated by reference. Most existing particle monitoring systems are based on light 
scattering. When such systems are installed in semiconductor processing 
equipment, a beam of light is directed into the exhaust line where some 
fraction of the input light scatters from particulate matter flowing within the 
exhaust line. An optical detector is disposed in the exhaust line so that only 
light scattered by the particulate matter is collected by the detector. The  
 
output signal from the detector corresponds to relative particulate levels 
within the exhaust line. One problem with particle monitoring systems 
based on light scattering is that such systems generally can only detect 
particles larger than 0.1 µm (microns) and, more practically, larger than 0.3 µm 
(microns). U.S. Patent No. 3,787,746 to Atac describes a system useful for 
detecting the passage of energetic charged particles of the sort produced by 
radioactive decay reactions. The Atac detector includes a pair of electrodes 
biased to an electric field below breakdown and immersed in a special 
gaseous medium. When a high-velocity charged particle passes between the 
electrodes of the detector, the charged particle causes a portion of the 
gaseous medium to become ionized. If the particle is sufficiently energetic 
to ionize the gaseous medium and to produce an electrical discharge, a 
sustained current passes between the electrodes of the detector. This 
current can be measured in an attached circuit to signal the passage of the 
charged particle. Systems such as that described in the Atac patent are not 
suitable for detection of particulate matter in the exhaust line of
