<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for treating biodegradable substrates which arise discontinuously, in particular biowastes. The substrates, if appropriate after a pretreatment, are subjected to a fermentation in a digestion stage (6) in the presence of anaerobic biomass. A conditioning stage (2) is provided upstream of the digestion stage (6), into which conditioning stage at least some of the anaerobic biomass from the digestion stage (6) is recycled via a return line (8). In the conditioning stage (2), aerobic conditions are maintained at times and/or in places. The substrates are homogenised in the conditioning stage (2) and preferably enzymatically hydrolysed by setting thermophilic temperatures and an acid environment. Furthermore, a hydraulic balance is produced in the conditioning stage (2) between a discontinuous charging of the conditioning stage (2) with fresh substrate and continuous charging of the digestion stage (6) with conditioned substrate.

Process for treating biodegradable substrates 
produced batchwise, in particular biowastes, which, if 

appropriate, after a pretreatment are subjected to a 
fermentation in a digestion stage (6) in the presence of 

an anaerobic biomass, a conditioning stage (2) being 
connected upstream of the digestion stage (6), into which 

conditioning stage at least a part of the anaerobic 
biomass is recycled from the digestion stage (6) and in 

which the substrates are homogenized, characterized in 
that 


a) aerobic conditions are maintained at least at times 
and/or in places in the conditioning stage (2), and 
b) a hydraulic balance is produced in the conditioning 
stage (2) between batchwise charging of the conditioning 

stage (2) with fresh substrate and continuous charging of 
the digestion stage (6) with conditioned substrate. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the conditioning stage (2), aerobic and 

anaerobic conditions alternating in time and space are 
established. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the conditioning stage (2) is intermittently 

aerated. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the substrate is hydrolyzed in the 

conditioning stage (2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that an acidic environment is maintained 

in the conditioning stage (2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that the conditioning stage (2) is 
operated at thermophilic temperatures. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the conditioning stage (2) is 

heated. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that exhaust gas produced in the conditioning 

stage (2) is removed and fed to a bio filter (11) 
for biological purification. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that a hydraulic residence time of 5 

hours to 7 days is set in the conditioning stage (2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that a temperature of 40 to 55Â°C is set 

in the conditioning stage (2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1to 10, 
characterized in that the conditioning stage (2) is 

aerated at an aeration rate of 3 to 6 m

/m
3
/h. 
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 11, 
characterized in that, when aeration is intermittent, 

aeration periods of 5 minutes' to 30 minutes' duration 
and aeration pauses of 20 min to 4 h are maintained. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the fresh substrate to be fed to 

the conditioning stage (2) is thickened to a solids 
concentration of 7 to 18%.
