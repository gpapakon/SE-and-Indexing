<ABSTRACT>
A handler for containers comprising 
horizontally opposed timing belt assemblies for 

conveying containers along a straight path. Each 
timing belt assembly has upper and lower belts (16) 

supported by a pair of idler rollers (32) which define one 
side of the straight path. The timing belts are 

driven by the same motor (18) while the upper belts can be 
displaced transversely of each other to accommodate 

tapered containers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Glass containers are conventionally 
manufactured in an individual section (I.S.) machine. 
The manufactured containers are deposited on a 
conveyor which sequentially delivers them to any 
number of inspection stations or inspection machines. 
Such containers can be generally cylindrical or they 
can be tapered. When a container is cylindrical it 
can be supported on its base or its periphery can be 
engaged by opposed pairs of timing belt pairs. 
Tapered containers have been difficult to convey 
other than by supporting their base. The invention generally comprises a handler for 
containers comprising horizontally opposed timing 
belt assemblies for conveying containers along a 
straight path, each including
 
   a frame,
 
   a lower timing belt,
 
   means for supporting said timing belt on said 
frame including a pair of idler rollers for defining 
one side of said straight path,
 
   means for driving said lower timing belt 
including a motor and motor driven drive roller 
means,
 
   said supporting means further including said 
motor driven drive roller means,
 
   an upper timing belt, and
 
   means for supporting said upper timing belt 
including
 
   said motor driven drive roller means,
 
   a pair of idler rollers for defining one side 
of said straight path,
 
   means for supporting said upper pair of idler 
rollers, and
 
   means for mounting said upper idler roller 
supporting means on said frame at a location within  
 
a predetermined range of locations extending 
transverse to said straight path. It is accordingly an object of the present 
invention to provide a ware (glassware, etc.) handler 
which can effectively positively convey tapered ware. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following 
portion of this specification and from the accompanying 
drawings which illustrate in accordance with the 
mandate of the patent statutes a presently preferred 
embodiment incorporating the principles of the 
invention. Referring to the drawings: 
Figure one is an oblique view of the container 
inspecting machine made in accordance with the 
teachings of the present invention; Figure 2 is an oblique view of the machine 
illustrating how the lower belt of each belt assembly 
is supported; and Figure 3 is a top view showing how the upper 
belt of each belt assembly, is supported. Spaced bottles 10, which may be made in an I.S. 
machine, are carried by a horizontal feed conveyor 12 
which is moving at a constant speed S1 and are 
delivered to a

<CLAIMS>
A handler for containers comprising horizontally 
opposed timing belt assemblies for conveying 

containers along a straight path, each including a 
frame 40, a lower timing belt 16, 

   means for supporting said timing belt on said 
frame including a pair of idler rollers 32 for 

defining one side of said straight path, means for 
driving said lower timing belt including a motor 18 

and motor driven drive roller means 34, said supporting 
means further including said motor driven drive 

roller means, and an upper timing belt 16, characterized 
by 

   means for supporting said upper timing belt 
including 

      said motor driven drive roller means 34, 
      a pair of idler rollers 32 for defining 

one side of said straight path, 
      means 46 for supporting said upper pair of 

idler rollers, and 
      means 48, 50, 52 for mounting said upper 

idler roller supporting means on said frame at a 
location within a predetermined range of locations 

extending transverse to said straight path. 
A handler for containers according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said upper timing belt 

supporting means further comprises 
      a take-up roller 36, 

      a lever arm 54 for supporting said take-up 
roller at one end, 

      means for supporting the other end of said 
lever arm on said upper idler roller supporting means 

for selected pivotal displacement, and 
      means 47 for securing said lever arm to 

said upper idler roller supporting means at a 
 

selected pivotal location. 
A handler for containers according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said motor driven drive roller 

means comprises 
      a first motor driven drive roller 34 for 

supporting said lower timing belt, 
      a second motor driven drive roller 34 for 

supporting said upper timing belt, and 
      means 35 for changing the axial position 

of one said second motor driven drive roller relative 
to the other motor driven drive roller.
