<ABSTRACT>
A seat back comprises a frame structure (1) from which are resiliently suspended a first platform element (3) and a second platform element (4) that together provide support for the upholstery of the seat. The first platform element (3) can be buckled to provide adjustable horizontal lumbar support. In addition, the lower margin of the platform element (3) is coupled to a cranked shaft (21) that can be adjustably rotated to vary the vertical position of the platform element (3) in the frame structure (1). During such adjustment, the upper margin of the platform element (3) slides upon lateral rails (6, 6A) of the upper platform element (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements in and relating to 
seat arrangements providing adjustable lumbar support. 
Such an arrangement is particularly adapted to a seat 
structure for use in an automobile, bus, minibus, train, 
office or furniture seat of the kind wherein a platform 
element providing support for the upholstery of the seat is 
resiliently suspended in a seat frame. It is known, see for example EP 0 169 293, that an assembly 
for incorporation in a seat back to provide adjustable 
lumbar support may comprise a platform element adapted to 
be suspended in a seat frame to support the cushioning of 
a seat rest, said platform element including two elongate 
lateral rails between which extend transverse members that 
provide the platform support, adjustable means being linked 
between respective portions of each of said elongate rails 
to apply thereto a force of longitudinal compression, 
whereby said rails are caused to be arched outwardly in the 
lumbar region of the back rest together with the transverse 
members carried thereby. Such an arrangement provides an adjustable and comfortable 
lumbar support which is of relatively simple design. It 
has the disadvantage, however, that although the degree of 
lumbar support can be readily adjusted in the horizontal 
direction, the vertical position at which lumbar support is 
provided is determined by the initial geometric shape of 
the platform element and the points at which the 
compression forces are applied to the lateral rails, so 
that it is impossible for an occupant of the seat to adjust 
the lumbar support in a vertical direction to meet 
individual requirements.  
 There is further known, see GB-A-2,013,487 a seat assembly 
providing the features of the pre-characterising clause of claim 
1. It is an object of the present invention to provide a seat back 
arrangement allowing both vertical and horizontal adjustment of 
a platform element providing lumbar support whilst also enabling 
effective support to be provided independently in the upper 
region of the seat back. This object is achieved by the characterising features of claim 
1. Advantageously the said second adjusting means is coupled 
between the frame structure and a lower margin of the said 
platform element in such a manner that the said lower margin is 
fixed in its vertically adjusted position. Such an arrangement 
not only enables the construction of the second adjusting means 
to be mechanically simple, but also improves the effectiveness  
 
of the horizontal lunmbar
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A seat back comprising a frame structure (1) from which is 
resiliently suspended a platform element (3) for supporting 

upholstery of the seat back, said platform element being linked 
to a first adjusting means (19) for applying a force of 

longitudinal compression between points (11,17) of the platform 
element spaced in a vertical direction, in order to cause 

resilient buckling of the platform element (3) to arch outwardly 
in the lumbar region of the seat back, said platform element (3) 

being linked to a second adjusting means (25) for effecting 
vertical displacement of said platform element (3) relatively 

to the said frame structure (1), characterised in that said 
platform element (3) is supplemented by a second resiliently 

suspended platform element (4) located in the upper region of 
the frame structure (1), the arrangement being such that the 

further platform element (4) provides support for the upper 
horizontal margin of the first platform element (3), whilst 

accommodating relative sliding motion of the first platform 
element (3) under the influence of the second adjusting means 

(25). 
A seat back according to Claim 1 characterised in that said 
second adjusting means (25) is coupled between the frame 

structure (1) and a lower margin (17B) of the said platform 
element (3) in such a manner that the said lower margin (17B)  

 
is fixed in its vertically adjusted position. 
A seat back according to claim 2, characterised in that 
said second adjusting means (25) comprises a shaft (21), 

journalled at its ends in the frame structure (1) and having an 
eccentric intermediate portion pivotally coupled to said lower 

margin (17B) of the said platform element (3). 
A seat back according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
platform elements (3,4) each comprise a wire grid, wherein 

transverse supporting wires (7,8) are tensioned between lateral 
rails (5,6) that are in turn coupled to the frame structure by 

tension springs (2). 
A seat back according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
lateral rails (5) of the first platform element (3) are 

interconnected at their upper ends to form a transverse rail 
(5A) at the upper margin of the platform element (3) that can 

slide against the lateral rails (6) of the second platform 
element (4). 
A seat back according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
lateral rails (6) of the second platform element (4) have 

obliquely angled inturned ends (6A) to provide additional 
support for the transverse rail (5A) of the first platform 

element (3).
