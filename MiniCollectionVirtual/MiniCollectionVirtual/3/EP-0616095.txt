<ABSTRACT>
A bar grating for covering gutters, shafts and similar hollows comprises retaining parts which each form a connecting pin, grating bars which are located thereon and have through-passage openings, and intermediate pieces which are arranged between these, and it can be laid with different installation dimensions. The intermediate pieces are each designed as a single-part connecting member which exhibits a central spacing part and, on both sides thereof, axial aligned joining parts as retaining parts and is intended for two adjacent grating bars, said joining parts, in the installation position, engaging through the respective through-passage openings of two adjacent grating bars such that the latter bear on respective spacing-part supporting surfaces which project radially beyond the joining-part diameter.

case two connecting parts (10,11) which face each other

alternately in the connection axes (7,8).

apertures (23).
A bar grating according to Claim 7, characterised in that
for forming the extensible array (4') there are in each

grating bar (3') and arranged in equidistant pairs, four 
screw-threaded bores (24) which form the connection axes

(26,27;26',27') and which receive the respectively offset
connecting members (2').
A bar grating according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the connecting parts (32) of the

connecting members (30) are each constructed as catch
projections (34) which are adapted to pass through the

cylindrical apertures (33) in the grating bars (3").
