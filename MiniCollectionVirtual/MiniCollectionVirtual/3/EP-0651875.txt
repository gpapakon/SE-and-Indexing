<ABSTRACT>
A guideway (10) of a guideway set in a coordinate measuring machine has a scale in the form of a metal strip clamped and bonded to an accessible face (46) of a spar (30), the latter being formed of a thermally stable material and being connected at one end to a reference position defined by a bracket (18) and a mounting plate (16) on the guideway (10). The spar (30) is mounted on the guideway (10) by spaced blocks (34) which are designed to accommodate any longitudinal movement of the guideway (10) due to thermal expansion, so that the spar (30) and the scale are effectively maintained in position. Because relative movement between the spar (30) and the scale is substantially prevented, the position of the scale is substantially fixed, providing improve scale accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a scale assembly for use
in monitoring movement of a component on a structure,
and is particularly but not exclusively concerned with
monitoring movement of a component on a linear guideway
of a high accuracy measuring and checking machine.For purposes of accuracy, it is necessary to
construct coordinate measuring machines using either
heavyweight materials, such as granite, which remain as
stable as possible with variations in temperature, in
order that guideways of the machine do not distort and
thereby detract from the accuracy of measurement, or
special designs of mountings for the guideways which can
accomodate differential thermal expansion between the
materials used. However, irrespective of the
construction used, there remains a problem with scales
which are mounted on the guideways for use in a
non-contact linear encoder system. Some such scales
have been made of a non-thermally stable material and,
as the guideways require to be made of a material whose
surface can be machine to a high accuracy, and
therefore inevitable a non-thermally stable material,
there still results a differential thermal expansion
between the materials of the scale and the guideway.
Other scales are expensive and have length limitations.In DE-U-9205393, an arrangement for measuring the
relative positions of two objects mounts a scanning unit
on one of the objects, positioned to scan a graduated
scale on the other object in order to obtain positional
data. The design of the prior device attempts to make
the scale predictable in terms of length change due to
temperature change, in order to allow the user to be
able to compensate for that change. The intention is to
avoid the need for all the various components to be made 
from materials with the same coefficient of thermal expansion. Such a design
is not, however, appropriate for use in a high accuracy measuring and checking
machine, where it is desirable to maintain the scale in the same spatial position
regardless of temperature changes.According to the present invention there is provided a scale assembly for
use in monitoring movement of a component on a guideway structure of a
measuring and/or checking machine, the assembly comprising an elongate
scale, means for securing the scale to a support, and means for mounting the
support on the structure, characterised by means for non-movably connecting
one end of the structure to a part of the machine which remains substantially
stable with variations in temperature, means for fixedly mounting one
