<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
method for the recovery of zinc oxide as 
indicated in the preamble of Claim 1. Zinc oxide typically is a coarse white or greyish 
powder which has a variety of uses including as an 
accelerator activator, as a pigment, as a dietary 
supplement and in the semiconductor field. Zinc oxide is 
found in commerical by-products including waste material 
streams such as fly ash and flue dust. Methods for 
recovering zinc oxides are known in the art, including 
recovering zinc oxide from industrial waste materials. 
Such previous methods have included leaching with mineral 
acid, caustic soda, ammonium hydroxide, and ammonium 
carbonate solutions. However, these methods have low 
yields of zinc oxide and typically do not recovery pure 
zinc oxide, the recovered zinc oxide being contaminated 
with other metal salts. Therefore, in order to obtain 
pure zinc oxide, subsequent roasting and evaporation 
processes were necessary. A method of the type indicated in above preamble is known from DE-C-435488. Said method allows the preparation of technical grade zinc oxide. Burrows, U.S. Patent No. 3,849,121, assigned to a 
principal of the assignee of the present invention, 
discloses another method for the selective recovery of zinc 
oxide from industrial waste. The Burrows method comprises 
leaching the a waste material with an ammonium chloride 
solution at elevated temperatures, separating iron from 
solution, treating the solution with zinc metal and 
cooling the solution to precipitate zinc oxide. The 
Burrows patent discloses a method to take metal dust which   
 
is mainly a mixture of iron and zinc oxides and, in a 
series of steps, to separate out the iron oxides and waste 
metals. However, the material obtained in the last step 
is a mixture of a small amount of zinc oxide, hydrated 
zinc phases which can include hydrates of zinc oxide and 
zinc hydroxide, as well as other phases and a large amount 
of diamino zinc dichloride Zn(NH3)2Cl2 or other similar 
compounds containing zinc and chlorine ions. Currently, 
the Burrows method is not economically viable because of 
Environmental Protection Agency guidelines established 
subsequent of the issuance of the Burrows patent. 
Additionally, the Burrows method is not a continuous 
method and, therefore, is not economical as a continuous 
process. Thus, there exists a need for a method which will 
recover zinc oxide from industrial waste which results in 
a product the majority of which is zinc oxide, and not 
mixtures

<CLAIMS>
A method for the recovery of zinc oxide 
from waste material streams which comprise zinc compounds, 

comprising the steps of: 

a. treating said waste material with an 
ammonium chloride solution at an elevated temperature to 

form a solution comprising dissolved zinc and dissolved 
zinc oxide whereby any iron oxide in said waste material 

will not go into solution; 
b. separating said solution from any 
undissolved materials present in said solution including 

any of said iron oxide; 
c. adding zinc metal to said solution whereby 
any lead and cadmium ions contained within said solution 

are displaced by said zinc metal and precipitate out of 
said solution as lead and cadmium metals; 
d. separating said solution from the lead and 
cadmium metals; 
e. lowering the temperature of said solution 
thereby precipitating the zinc component as a mixture of 

crystallized zinc compounds; 
f. separating said precipitated zinc compounds 
from said solution; 
g. washing said zinc compounds solids with a 
wash water thereby solubilizing certain of said zinc 

compounds; 
h. separating the remaining zinc compound 
solids from said solution; and 
g. drying said remaining zinc compound solids 
at a temperature of between about 100°C and 200°C to obtain 

zinc oxide of high purity 
 
characterized in that 


said ammonium chloride solution of step C is maintained at 
a temperature of at least 90°C;  

 
the concentration of said ammonium chloride solution is 
23% by weight; 
in step e the temperature of said solution is lowered in a 
controlled fashion to between about 20°C and about 60°C 

over a predetermined period of time to precipitate the 
zinc component therefrom; 
in step g said wash water has a temperature of between about 25°C 
and 100°C. 
The method as described in Claim 1, further 
comprising the step of recycling said solution after the 

zinc component is precipitated therefrom to be reemployed 
in step a. 
The method as described in Claim 1, further 
comprising the step of recycling wash water after said 

zinc oxide is separated therefrom to be reemployed in step 
g. 
The method as described in Claim 1 operated 
continuously. 
The method as described in Claim 1, further 
comprising the step of adding a dispersant to said 

solution concurrently while adding zinc metal in powdered form to said 

solution in step c. 
The method as described in Claim 5, 
wherein said dispersant is present in said solution in the 

concentration of between about 10 to about 1000 ppm. 
The method as described in Claim 6, 
wherein said dispersant is selected from the group 

consisting of water soluble polymers.  
 
The method as described in Claim 7, 
wherein said dispersant is selected from the group 

consisting of maleic based acrylic oligmers, 
lignosulfonates, polyphosphates, polyacrylates, 

polymethacrylates, maleic anhydride copolymers, polymaleic 
anhydride, phosphate esters, and phosphonates.
