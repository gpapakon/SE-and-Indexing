<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new uses of the dimerised form of lysozyme for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting biosynthesis of Tumor Necrosis Factor in animals and humans. The lysozyme dimer is in particular useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases associated with excessively high levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical formulations of the medicament according to the invention, namely injections comprising the dimerised form of lysozyme in amounts of 0,01-10 mg/ml, of an apyrogenic sterile composition comprising at least one physiologically acceptable solvent and at least one pharmaceutically approved preservative, as well as to tampons and antiseptive dressings impregnated with, and ointments or gels comprising an effective dose of the dimerised form of lysozyme for the prevention and/or treatment of sepsis and septic shock, especially of infected wounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new medical uses of
lysozyme dimer and of compositions containing such dimer.
The new uses are related to treating certain disfunctions of
natural defensive mechanisms.Enzymes in their monomeric forms have been known already for
a long time to be therapeutically effective in the treatment
of various diseases.Lysozyme was discovered by Fleming in 1922, but it was not
before 1950 that its enzymatic functions were revealed.
Since that time the compound has been the subject of
intensive research and various therapeutic effects were
reported. Among others, these were antiviral, antibacterial,
anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic properties. The
therapeutic use of lysozyme, however, has been rather
limited due to the negative side effects of the monomeric
form.This limitation of the practical use of lysozyme and other
therapeutically active enzymes was overcome in the late
eighties when it was discovered that isolated dimerized
forms of enzymes, while retaining all beneficial properties
of known monomeric forms, exhibit no negative side effects
when used in therapeutic doses. The antiviral and
antibacterial compositions comprising as the active
ingredient lysozyme dimer or other dimerised enzymes have
been described in WO 89/11294. In that application it was
reported that in in vitro tests the lysozyme dimer has
inhibited proliferation of a number of bacterial strains
cultivated on samples taken from patients in concentrations
of 5 - 20 mg/ml of the culture. It was also reported there 
that the dimer was effective in treating canine parvovirus
(CPV) infections when administered orally twice a day at a
dose of 1 - 2 mg/kg of body weight.As the research work by the inventor was continued, further
attractive features of lysozyme dimers were found and new
therapeutical uses of the drug were developed.In clinical tests performed in order to confirm the anti-bacterial
and antiviral effectiveness of lysozyme dimer it
was surprisingly found out that the dimer is unexpectedly
potent in curing acute forms of diseases of the digestive
and respiratory tracts. Accordingly, new investigations were
carried out in order to determine the effect of lysozyme
dimer in those stages of different diseases in which the
natural defensive mechanisms fail.It is known that the bacterial toxins constitute one group
of many virulence factors by which bacteria cause diseases.
Some recent advances in the knowledge of bacterial toxins
concern their interaction with the host's immune system.
