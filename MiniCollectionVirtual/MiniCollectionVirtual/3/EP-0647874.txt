<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyamic 
acids and polyimides prepared therefrom having 
nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. In particular, the 
present invention relates to polyamic acids and 
polyimides prepared therefrom with NLO side chains 
covalently attached thereto, thereby improving the 
chemical and thermal stability of the NLO moiety. The NLO side-chains of the polymers of the 
present invention are stable in processing solvents and 
at processing temperatures used in the production of 
electro-optic devices. When suitably oriented, the 
compounds are capable of highly efficient second 
harmonic generation and electro-optic modulation of an 
electromagnetic wave having a wavelength between 300 nm 
and 2,000 nm. The present invention further relates to 
methods for preparing the polymer compositions of the 
present invention, as well as intermediate compounds 
useful in the preparation of the inventive polymers. Highly efficient NLO materials capable of 
doubling or tripling the frequency of incident life are 
currently of great scientific and technological 
interest for use in optical telecommunications, signal 
processing and the construction of optical computers. 
Nonlinear optics is concerned with the interaction of 
electromagnetic fields in various media to produce new 
fields which may be altered in phase, frequency or 
amplitude. The NLO effective material upon an 
electromagnetic field is a function of the second and 
higher order terms of the following equation:

P=αE+βE²+γE³+. . . 


 
P is the polarization of material, E is the intensity 
of the electric field, and the coefficients α, β and γ, 
etc., are indicative of the NLO susceptibility of the  
 
material. Such coefficients are constant for a given 
material but vary from material to material. The 
second order coefficient, β, for a given material, is 
indicative of the second harmonic generation properties 
of the material, with second harmonic generation 
efficiencies increasing as the value of β increases. Candidate NLO materials should possess good 
physical properties, such as high optical 
transparencies, low dielectric constants and high laser 
damage thresholds. The material should also possess 
the molecular nonlinearity required of NLO materials, 
and particularly, high β values, fast response times 
and nonlinear susceptibility over a broad range of 
wavelengths, particularly of wavelengths between about 
300 nm and 2,000 nm. Recent efforts in the development of NLO 
materials have focused upon non-centrosymmetric
