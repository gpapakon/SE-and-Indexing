<ABSTRACT>
A vent arrangement for a fuel filler pipe (11) for motor vehicles. The arrangement comprises a vent passage (12) between a fuel tank's (10) upper part and the upper part of the fuel filler pipe (11). The passage comprises a chamber (16), the volume of which exceeds the fuel volume which can be forced upwards in the passage during filling. The chamber (16) is formed as a widening of the passage (12) which beneath the chamber forms a combined riser and vent tube (12a) in relation to the fuel tank (10). The passage above the chamber forms a vent tube (12b). The combined riser and vent tube (12a) has its orifice a small way inside the chamber (16). The tube presents a drainage hole (18) proximate the inside of the chamber wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vent arrangement
for fuel filler pipes in motor vehicles, which arrangement
comprises a vent passage between a fuel tank's upper
part and the upper part of the fuel filler pipe, which passage
comprises a chamber, the volume of which
exceeds the fuel volume which can be forced upwards
in the passage during filling, whereby the chamber is
formed as a widening of the passage and the passage
beneath the chamber forms a combined riser and vent
tube in relation to the fuel tank, whereby the passage
above the chamber forms a vent tube.It is well known that it can sometimes be difficult to
fill cars' fuel tanks with fuel. This occurs generally due to
the fact that the automatic filling-stop which is integrated
into the stationary pump arrangement's filling nozzle is
often so sensitive that the occurrence of even a small bit
of fuel in the filler pipe is regarded by the filling-stop as
an indication that the tank is full, with the result that the
filling is automatically stopped.Sensitive filling-stops are in themselves desirable
since they contribute to reducing the risk of environmentally
damaging leakage. The reason that the problem
has now arisen is mainly because the fuel tank, for reasons
of safety, is generally placed above or in front of
the back axle. Because of this, again due to safety reasons,
one is forced to place the filler tube under the
structural member (beam) construction which runs in
the car's longitudinal direction. In turn this requires that
a vent tube is arranged so as to allow evacuation of
air/gas from the tank during filling.Since said "air" in the tank is saturated with fuel
vapour, the vent tube is normally arranged parallel to
the filler pipe so that the vent tube can have its orifice
close to the filler pipe's orifice, whereby the fuel vapour
can be recycled via a protector-sleeve with suction
means, which protector sleeve is arranged on the filling
nozzle. Even the vent tube is therefore normally
arranged under the beam construction. This implies
also that when the tank is full, fuel passes into the vent
tube and collects in its lower bend. This fuel will be
sucked back into the tank to a certain degree at the
same time as the level in this drops. However, a remaining
quantity of fuel often has to be forced upwards to the
orifice of the filling tube by the incoming fuel before normal
venting can start.DE-OS 2254892 describes a vent arrangement
with a vessel having a volume sufficient to contain the
fuel which is forced upwardly from the vent

Vent arrangement for fuel filler pipes (11) in motor
vehicles, whi
ch arrangement comprises a vent passage (12)
between a fuel tank's (10) upper part and the upper part of

the fuel filler pipe (11), which passage comprises a
chamber (16), the volume of which exceeds the fuel volume

which can be forced upwards in the passage during filling,
whereby the chamber (16) is formed as a widening of the

passage (12) and the passage beneath the chamber forms a
combined riser and vent tube (12a) in relation to the fuel

tank (10), whereby the passage above the chamber forms a
vent tube (12b), characterized in that the combined riser

and vent tube (12a) has its orifice a small way inside the
chamber (16) and in that said tube presents a drainage hole

(18) proximate the inside of the chamber wall, 
said
drainage hole (18) being arranged for allowing return of

fuel which has collected in the chamber (16) between the
part of the riser and vent tube (12a) which projects

inwardly into the chamber (16) and the inside of the
chamber (16).
Vent arrangement according to claim 1, characterized
in that the vent tube (12b) has its orifice a small way

inside the chamber (16).
Vent arrangement according to claim 1, characterized
in that the chamber (16) comprises a splash trap (17) to

prevent fuel from splashing from the combined riser and
vent tube (12a) to the vent tube (12b).
Vent arrangement according to claim 3, characterized
in that the splash trap comprises a deflector plate (17)

placed at the orifice of the combined riser and vent tube
(12a).
