<ABSTRACT>
A light emitting device comprises a luminous 
region (2) comprising a luminous porous material comprising 

a crystalline semiconductor and a non-porous region (1) 
adjacent to the luminous region,

 
   wherein a conductive type between both the regions 

is different at an interface (4) between the luminous 
region and the non-porous region and the crystal 

structure between both the regions is continuous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light emitting
device and a light emitting device manufacturing
method.Recently, porous materials have been remarkable as
a new functional material used for an active structure
factor in a device. The porous structure of IV-group
semiconductor crystal, for example, has been chiefly
used for the conventional SOI (Silicon On Insulator)
structure forming process (refer to T. Unagami and M.
Seki, J. Electrochem. Soc. 125, 1339 (1978)) because of
its rapid oxidation capability. In this case, raw
material has been used only as a structural material,
in no connection with its electronic and optical
properties. However, recently, a research and
development has been vigorously made as for an
application to light emitting devices which originates
from a luminous phenomenon at room temperatures and
with high efficiency (refer to L. T. Canham, Appl.
Phys. Lett. 56, 1046 (1990)) because of the luminous
phenomenon at low temperature (refer to C. Pickering,
et al., J. Phys. C17, 6535 (1984)) due to a micro-structure 
with a desirable carrier quantum closing
effect. Generally, the porous structure itself can be
easily shaped by processing a raw material. If some
problems are overcome to put into a practical use,
applying functionally such porous materials may provide
a very attractive new technology.One large obstacle which impedes putting the
porous material to practical use is that it is
difficult to inject current to the porous region. An
active light emitting device must function as an
electroluminescence (EL) device. In order to realize
an EL device with higher efficiency, it is desirable to
use a current injection-type device. It has been so
far reported that a light emitting diode (LED) using a
solid-state electrode on a current injection layer
indicates far lower efficiency, in comparison with the
potential high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of the
same porous material. For example, a naked eye can
clearly recognize under an illumination in a room that
a porous silicon layer which is formed by anodizing the
surface of a monocrystalline silicon substrate in a
hydrofluoric acid solution is luminous over visible
rays range in response to an illumination by a several-watt
ultraviolet rays lamp so that the PL energy
efficiency exceeds several %. However, since the
current injection which is performed via a Schottky
junction between a semi-transparent gold electrode and 
the same porous layer has less than a quantum
efficiency of 10-3 % (refer to N. Koshida, et al., Appl.
Phys.,
