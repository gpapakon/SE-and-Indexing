<ABSTRACT>
Process for treating a substrate, namely a fibre or a fibrous product, with a superabsorbent material, in which process there is applied to the surface of the substrate, which is not an aramid fibre, a layer of a water-in-oil emulsion which contains a superabsorbent material in its aqueous phase, so that there is applied to the substrate, calculated on its dry weight, 0.3 to 40 wt.% of the superabsorbent material, after which the liquid constituents of the emulsion are wholly or partially removed from the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for treating a yarn, which is not an aramide yarn, with a 
superabsorbent material. According to EP-A-0 351 100, KevlarÂ®, a commercially 
available aramide yarn, is impregnated with a superabsorbent material. 
After being impregnated the treated yarn is dried, so that a film is 
formed in and around the yarn's interstices. In one embodiment of this 
method of treatment the yarn is impregnated with a superabsorbent 
material derived from an aqueous solution comprising an acrylate 
polymeric material which combines acrylic acid and sodium acrylate 
functionalities and water. EP-A-0 482 703 (published 29.04.92, filing date 17.10.91, priority date 29.10.90) relates to 
an aramide yarn provided with a superabsorbent material. Such a yarn 
may be made by applying to the surface of an aramid yarn a layer of a 
water-in-oil emulsion containing a superabsorbent material in its 
aqueous phase, and then removing the liquid constituents of the 
emulsion wholly or in part from the yarn by means of evaporation. The following background art regarding the treatment of various 
fibrous products with a superabsorbent material can be referred to. Wire Industry, October 1989, pp. 629-635, discloses the use in cables 
of swellable yarns (made from swelling nonwovens) and non-woven tapes 
composed of two or more layers of a synthetic fibres structure with a 
swellable powder embedded therein. The backing layer is composed of a 
thermally bonded non-woven of polyethylene terephthalate. The cover 
layer may contain a proportion of cellulose fibres. US-A-4 798 744 discloses a method of making 
superabsorbent fibrous porous support by impregnation of a porous  
 
support with a reverse suspens on or emulsion. Said reverse suspension 
or emulsion results from the polymerization reaction and the removal 
of solvent from the support. The porous support can be a non-woven 
material, paper, fibre pile or a foam, of which the porosity is 
preferably greater than 0,5. Cellulose fibres are mentioned. The fibres 
treated are meant to comprise is much absorbent material as possible, 
so that the absorbent capacity is as large as possible. The 
superabsorbent material consists of a mixture of polyacrylic acid and 
an alkali acrylate, and a surfactant having an HLB value of 8-12. US-A-4 888 238 discloses a method of making 
superabsorbent synthetic fibres of which the surface is coated with a 
layer of superabsorbent polymer. As synthetic fibres suitable to be 
used are mentioned fibres of polyester,

<CLAIMS>
A process for coating a yarn as such, which is not an aramide yarn, with a 
superabsorbent material, characterised by applying to the surface 

of the yarn a layer of a water-in-oil emulsion which contains a 
superabsorbent material in its aqueous phase, the superabsorbent 

material being applied in an amount of from 0.3 to 40 wt.%, based on the dry weight of the untreated yarn, and 
subsequently wholly or partially removing the liquid constituents 

of the emulsion from the yarn. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
percentage of superabsorbent material is 0.5 to 20 wt.%. 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
percentage of superabsorbent material is 0,5 to 10 wt.%. 
A process according to any one of claims 1-3, characterised in 
that the water-in-oil emulsion contains an emulsifier having an 

HLB-value between 3 and 6. 
A process according to any one of claims 1-4, characterised in 
that the water-in-oil emulsion contains 20-80 wt.%, calculated on

that the yarn to be treated is made up wholly or substantially of 

polyester, aliphatic polyamide, cellulose, polyolefin, 
polyacrylonitrile, carbon, glass, or metal fibres, or mixtures of 

the foregoing fibres. 
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that the fibres 
are made of polyethylene terephthalate.  

 
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that the fibres 
are made of nylon-6 and/or nylon-6,6.
