<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns steel obtained by powder metallurgy, formed from a sintered and densified high purity pre-alloyed powder. The invention is characterised in that the steel weight composition is as follows: manganese 
<
 1 %; silicon 
<
 1 %; chromium 6.05-6.45 %; molybdenum 2.50-3.50 %; vanadium 0.80-2 %; tungsten 
<
 0.5 %; sulphur 
<
 0.020 %; phosphorus 
<
 0.030 %; niobium 0.60-1.60 %; cobalt 2 to 5 %; nitrogen 0.050 to 0.080 %; aluminium 
<
 0.060 %; carbon 0.75-0.95 %; nickel 
<
 0.50 %; the rest being iron and the standard impurities involved in steel manufacture.
