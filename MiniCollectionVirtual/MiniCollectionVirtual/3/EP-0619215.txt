<ABSTRACT>
An undercarriage structure of a motor vehicle has a 
pair of front frames (1), a pair of floor frames (2) integrally 

connected with rear ends of the front frames, a floor panel (18) 
attached to the floor frames (2), and side sills (20) extending in a 

front/rear direction and being connected with the sides of 
the floor frames (2). The floor frames (2), the side sills (20) and the 

floor panel (18) together form closed sections extending in the 
front/rear direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an undercarriage
structure of a motor vehicle, in particular to an
undercarriage structure of a motor vehicle having great
rigidity against loads acting from the side.There is known a motor vehicle undercarriage structure
as shown in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 3-85278.
This conventional undercarriage structure is provided with a
front floor, a tunnel portion integrated with the front floor
extending a front/rear direction, a rear floor disposed
behind the front floor, and a pair of boxed channels formed
by the rear edge of the front floor and the front edge of the
rear floor, which are arranged to extend in the width
direction and are connected at inner ends thereof to the
tunnel portion.In the conventional motor vehicle undercarriage,
since the tunnel portion has great rigidity, the
undercarriage is effective against loads acting from the
side. Nevertheless, there remains a need for a motor vehicle
undercarriage with greatly increased rigidity and reduced
weight.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide an undercarriage structure of a motor vehicle
having great rigidity against loads acting from the side.It is another object of the present invention to
provide an undercarriage structure of a motor vehicle in
which carious equipment can be disposed on and/or under a
floor panel.GB-A-452196 discloses an undercarriage structure of a
motor vehicle comprising a frame comprising a respective
front frame member and situated at each side of the
vehicle; a respective floor frame member integrally
connected with the rear end of each front frame member; a
floor panel attached to the floor frames; a respective side
sill on each side of the vehicle extending in a front/rear
direction and being connected with the side of a respective
floor frame; wherein the floor panel is attached to the
upper surfaces of the frame; and the frame extends
downwardly to a lower surface of the floor panel at a front
end side of the floor panel. According to the present invention, such a structure
is characterised in that the frame and lower surface of the
floor panel at a front end side of the floor panel form
first closed sections, and
wherein the frame curves outwardly in a vehicle width
direction at the front end side of the floor panel so as to
be connected with the side sills, extends towards a rear
side of the vehicle parallel to the side sills while
connected to the side sills, and forms second closed
sections together with both the floor panel and the side
sills.In

An undercarriage structure of a motor vehicle
comprising a frame (1,2) comprising a respective front

frame member (1) and situated at each side of the vehicle;
a respective floor frame member (2) integrally connected

with the rear end of each front frame member; a floor panel
(16) attached to the floor frames; a respective side sill

(20) on each side of the vehicle extending in a front/rear
direction and being connected with the side of a respective

floor frame; wherein the floor panel (16) is attached to
the upper surfaces of the frame (1,2); and the frame (1,2)

extends downwardly to a lower surface of the floor panel
(16) at a front end side of the floor panel; characterised

in that the frame (1,2) and lower surface of the floor
panel (16) at a front end side of the floor panel form

first closed sections, and
wherein the frame curves outwardly in a vehicle width

direction at the front end side of the floor panel so as to
be connected with the side sills, extends towards a rear

side of the vehicle parallel to the side sills while
connected to the side sills, and forms second closed

sections (32) together with both the floor panel and the
side sills.
An undercarriage structure according to claim 1,
wherein the floor panel (16) forms a tunnel portion (18)

with a U-shaped cross section at an intermediate portion in
the front/rear direction thereof, the tunnel portion

extending in a width direction of a vehicle body, and the
second closed sections (32) being provided to extend upwardly at

the tunnel portion.
An undercarriage structure according to claim 2,
wherein the structure further comprises a pre-silencer (35)

and a main silencer (36) disposed in the tunnel portion
(18). 
An undercarriage structure according to claim 2 or
claim 3, wherein the structure further comprises seat slide

rails (44) for passenger seats on the tunnel portion (18)
of the floor panel (16).
An undercarriage structure according to any one of
claims 2 to 4, wherein the structure further comprises a

connecting member (45) spanning the tunnel portion (18) in
the front/rear direction, the connecting member supporting

a joint of a four-wheel drive shaft (46).
A undercarriage structure according to claim 2,
wherein the structure further comprises seat frames (52)

for passenger seats and a frame member (56) extending
between pillars (54) extending upwardly from the side

sills, front portions (52a) of the seat frames being
connected with the upwardly extending portion of the tunnel

portion of the floor panel, and rear portions (52b) of the
seat frames being connected with the frame member.
An undercarriage structure according to any one of
claims 2 to 6, wherein each side sill (20) includes a side

sill inner (22) and a side sill outer (24) which form a
third closed section (26) extending in the vehicle front

and rear direction, the third closed section extending
upwardly so as to be enlarged at the tunnel portion.
An undercarriage structure according to any one of
claims 2 to 7, wherein the frame includes reinforcements

(34) extending in the vehicle width direction within the
second closed sections (32).
An undercarriage structure according to claim 2,
wherein each side sill (20) includes a side sill inner (22)

and a side sill outer (24) which form a third closed
section (26) extending in the vehicle front and rear 

direction, the third closed section extending upwardly so
as to be enlarged at the rear portion of the frame.
