<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of ss-ionone by the sulphuric acid-catalysed cyclisation of pseudoionone in a two-phase solvent system consisting of concentrated sulphuric acid and an essentially water-immiscible second solvent is described, which process is characterised by the use of liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Inter alia, this process is carried out under a pressure of about 50 bar to about 150 bar and, before the subsequent discontinuation (quenching) of the cyclisation reaction, at temperatures from about -15@C to about +15@C. The process according to the invention is preferably carried out continuously and is an important intermediate stage in the synthesis of vitamin A.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of β-ionone by the sulphuric 
acid-catalyzed cyclization of pseudoionone in a two-phase 

solvent system comprising concentrated sulphuric acid and a 
second solvent essentially immiscible with water, characterized 

in that carbon dioxide liquefied under pressure is used as the 
second solvent. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that it is 
carried out under a pressure in the range of 80 bar to 120 bar. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the concentration of the sulphuric acid is at least 85 percent, 

preferably between 95 and 98 percent. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that it is carried out using a molar ratio of 

sulphuric acid:psuedoionone in the range of 2:1 to 5:1, preferably 
of 2.5:1 to 3.5:1. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that it is carried out at temperatures from -5°C 

to +10°C, preferably from 0°C to 5°C. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the reaction is stopped by mixing the 

reaction product with ice-water, cooled aqueous alkali or cooled, 
strongly diluted sulphuric acid. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that it is carried out continuously.
