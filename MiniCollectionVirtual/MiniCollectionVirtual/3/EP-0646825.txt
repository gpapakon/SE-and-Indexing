<ABSTRACT>
The inner and outer surfaces (2, 3) of a toric 
contact lens (1) have respectively a curved surface 

having a different radius of curvature wherein the 
central axis of the outer surfaces (3) is deviated 

downwardly from the central axis of the inner surface 
(2). Accordingly, the position of the gravity center of 

the lens is lowered because the lower portion of the lens 
is thicker than the upper portion. Further, slab-off 

portions (4, 5) are formed in the upper and lower 
portions of the outer surface of the lens (1). The 

contact lens of the present invention can certainly 
prevent the relation of the lens on the cornea; provides 

good feeling to a wearer, and is safe in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a contact lens for
correcting astigmatism or presbyopia. More particularly,
it relates to a toric contact lens or a multifocal
(bifocal) contact lens capable of preventing its rotation
on the eye during use.The astigmatism is a state that parallel beams do not
form an image at a point and the presbyopia is a state
that a man becomes inability to attain a sharp focus for
near vision due to the reduction of elasticity of the
crystalline lens. In order to correct the astigmatism or
presbyopia, glasses or a contact lens is usually used.As a contact lens to correct the astigmatism, there
is known a toric contact lens wherein the radius of
curvature of the inner (back) and/or the outer (front)
surfaces is different from each other in terms of two
orthogonally intersecting meridians.As a contact lens to correct the presbyopia, there is
known a multifocal (bifocal) contact lens wherein a
plurality of areas of the degree of lens power are formed 
at the inner (back) and/or outer (front) surfaces in
order to see near and distant objects.For a patient of astigmatism, it is necessary to wear
a toric contact lens at a correct position on a human
eye.There are various kinds of multifocal contact lens to
be worn by patients of presbyopia, some kinds of
multifocal contact lens have to be worn at a fixed
position to human eyes in the same manner as the toric
contact lens. The multifocal contact lens of the above-mentioned
kind is such that the areas of the different
degrees of lens power formed in the contact lens are not
at the positions of rotation symmetry when the lens is
viewed from the front side. When glasses are used, a
frame holding lenses is fitted to the ears or the nose.
Accordingly, the correct position of the lenses can be
assured. However, when a toric contact lens or a certain
kind of multifocal contact lens is used, there is no
means to fix the lenses, and accordingly, the contact
lenses tend to rotate on the eye, whereby it may not
obtain proper correction.For the toric contact lens or the multifocal contact
lens, there have been proposed various improvements to
prevent the rotation of the lens on the eye. The
proposed improvements can be generally classified into
two types. The first type is called a ballast type wherein the
lower portion of the contact lens is made relatively
heavy to thereby prevent the rotation of the lens on the
eye (the cornea). A bifocal (multifocal) type contact
lens 31 (Figure 7) which belongs this type, has been known
(for instance, in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A contact lens stabilized with regard to rotational orientation in the eye, which has a prism
ballast shape and the gravity center deviated downwardly from its geometric

center, and which has slab-off regions formed in at least upper and lower
peripheral portions of the lens characterized in that the shift of the gravity center of

the lens from its geometric center is in a range from 2.5% to 7.5% of the diameter
of the contact lens.
