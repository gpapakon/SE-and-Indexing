<ABSTRACT>
A switched current bilinear integrator comprising interconnected 
current memory cells (M1, M2) in which during a first phase of a clock 

cycle an input current is fed to the inputs of the current memory cells 
and during a second phase of a clock cycle an inverted version (A1) of 

the input current is fed to the inputs of the current memory cells. The 
output of the integrator is obtained by combining the output (optionally 

scaled) of the first current memory cell (M1) with an inverted (A2) 
version of the output (optionally scaled) of the second memory cell 

(M2) . 
A lossy integrator may be formed by feeding back to the input a 
scaled version of the current stored in the second current memory cell 

(N2) and an inverted, scaled version of the current stored in the first 
memoy cell (M1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrator using the switched current
technique.Switched current circuits are disclosed in a book entitled
"Switched-Currents an analogue technique for digital technology" edited
by C. Toumazou, J. B. Hughes and N. C. Battersby published by Peter
Peregrinus, ISBN 0 86341 294 7.First order filter building blocks which perform the bilinear z-transform
have well known advantages. Unlike Euler integrators, they
have no excess phase and so map to the z-plane with guaranteed
stability giving the resulting filter a distortion free amplitude response,
even in filters with clock frequencies approaching the Nyquist
frequency. This makes the bilinear integrator especially suitable for high
frequency filters.In the past the difficulty of making switched capacitor bilinear z-transform
integrators has led to the use of LDI techniques to produce
biquadratic sections with bilinear mapping. While a similar approach is
adopted for active ladder filters the simulation of the terminations is
only approximate. Consequently, an integrator/summer which can
perform true bilinear z-transformation is highly desirable.Several switched current bilinear z-transform integrators have been
proposed; for example that shown in the book edited by Toumazou,
Hughes and Battersby at page 48. An alternative bilinear z-transform
switched current integrator is disclosed in a paper by I. Song and G. W.
Roberts entitled "A fifth order bilinear switched current Chebyshev
filter" which was presented at the IEEE International Symposium on
Circuits and Systems in 1993 and published in the Conference 
Proceedings at pages 1097 to 1100.The common factor of all switched current bilinear z-transform
integrators previously known to the inventors is that they operate with only one
sample per clock period. In addition all except the Song and Roberts
integrator are single ended circuits and require current mirrors to produce
signal inversion. Unfortunately these mirrors introduce excess phase errors
and to keep these small the clock frequency must be made large compared
with the filter cut off frequency, thus nullifying one of the major advantages of
bilinear mapping.It is an object of the invention to enable the provision of a switched
current integrator building block which performs bilinear z-transformation
without excess phase error, thus allowing a lower clock frequency to be used.The invention is directed at a switched-current bilinear integrator
comprising first and second interconnected current memory cells, means for
feed

<CLAIMS>
A switched-current bilinear integrator comprising first and second
interconnected current memory cells, means for feeding an input current to be

integrated to the inputs of the current memory cells, and means for feeding an
inverted version of the input current to the inputs of the current memory cells,


characterised in that
 the means for feeding an input current to be integrated to
the inputs of the current memory cells is adapted to do so during a first portion

of a cycle of a clock signal, the means for feeding an inverted version of the
input current to the inputs of the current memory cells is adapted to do so

during a second portion of a cycle of the clock signal, and the integrator
comprises means for combining the output current of the first current memory

cell with an inverted version of the output current of the second current
memory cell, and means for deriving the integrated input current from the

output of the combining means.
A switched current bilinear integrator as claimed in Claim 1
comprising means for mirroring the outputs of the first and second current

memory cells, the mirrored outputs being fed to the combining means.
An integrator as claimed in Claim 2 in which the first current
memory has a further mirrored output, said further mirrored output being fed in

inverted form to the input and the second current memory has a further
mirrored output which is fed to the input.
An integrator as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3 in which the first
and second portions of the clock signal are each split into two sub-portions

and the current memory cells have a coarse current sensing cell which senses
the current at current memory cell input during the first subportion of one

portion of the clock signal and a fine current sensing cell which senses the
differences between the input current and the current produced by the coarse

current sensing cell during the second subportion and means for combining
the output currents of the coarse and fine current sensing cells during the

other portion of the clock cycle to output the stored current. 
A switched current bilinear integrator having differential
inputs and outputs comprising first and second integrators of the form

claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the current inversions are
performed by appropriately interconnecting the differential inputs to the

current memory cells during the first and second portions of the clock
cycle and by appropriately connecting the outputs of the current

memory cells to the differential outputs during the first and second
portions of the clock cycle.
