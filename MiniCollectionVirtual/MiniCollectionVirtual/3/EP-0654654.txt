<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pickup arrangement which is installed in roadway surfaces and is used for the detection of vehicle/aircraft wheel loads and/or their thrust components on the roadway surfaces during driving movement. The construction of the flanged-tube pickup 1 with piezoelectric crystal plates permits a modular construction in that piezo plates which are sensitive only to pressure P or to thrust S or combinations of the two are installed, since all the piezo plates have exactly the same dimensions. The force introduction flange 3 permits a concentration of the force lines onto the measuring arrangement 5 with a considerable mechanical amplification effect. The packaging of the flanged-tube pickup 1 to make a built-in pickup 17 ensures proper installation and positioning in the installation groove 11. In this arrangement, the two rolling force insulating masses 8 and the tube part insulating foam are important. The application of the invention is in traffic management for weight recording. As a result of the expansion of the thrust measurement, new applications for vehicle test sections and landing strips can be realised, which demonstrate new aspects of vehicle dynamics and safety.
