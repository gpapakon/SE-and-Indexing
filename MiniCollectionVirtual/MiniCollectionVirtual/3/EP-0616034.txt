<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a novel method and plasmid 
system for producing abundant quantities of CRM197 protein, 

diphtheria toxin or other CRM proteins related to diphtheria 
toxin, as well as to microorganisms transformed with the 

novel plasmid. A particularly preferred DNA plasmid, 
designated pPX 3511, that combines the gene for CRM197 from 

the nontoxigenic betaphage and the plasmid pNG2-22 is 
described. The novel plasmid system is capable of transforming 

strains of 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
 into strains 
which are capable of expressing high levels of the CRM197 

protein without the use of multiple lysogens. The invention 
provides in elegant means for increasing protein production 

without having to manipulate the expression vector, such as 
by increasing the promoter strength, or removing the 

promoter from iron regulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing diphteria toxin or
CRM protein that is cross reactive with diphteria toxin, a plasmid for expressing
diphteria toxin or CRM protein that is cross reactive with diphteria toxin in a
host, and a microorganism of the species Corynebacterium diphteria strain C7
that is transformed with such a plasmid.The CRM197 protein is a nontoxic form of diphtheria
toxin but is immunologically indistinguishable from the
diphtheria toxin. CRM197 is produced by C. diphtheriae
infected by the nontoxigenic phage β197tox- created by
nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis of the toxigenic corynephage β
(Uchida, T. etal. 1971, Nature New Biology233:8-11). The
CRM197 protein has the same molecular weight as the diphtheria
toxin but differs therefrom by a single base change
(guanine to adenine) in the structural gene. This single
base change causes an amino acid substitution (glutamic acid
for glycine) in the mature protein and eliminates the toxic
properties of diphtheria toxin. The CRM197 protein is a
safe and effective T-cell dependent carrier for saccharides
and is currently being used in the Haemophilus influenzae
type b oligosacharide CRM197 conjugate vaccine (HibTiter™;
Lederle Praxis Biologicals, Rochester, N.Y.).Production of significant quantities of the CRM197
protein for use in vaccines has been hindered due to low
protein abundance. Techniques have been developed to
bolster the production of CRM proteins using double lysogens
(Rappuoli, R., 1983, Applied Env. Microbio. 46:560-564; U.S.
Patent 4,925,792 issued to R. Rappuoli; and Rappuoli, R.,
1983, J. Bacteriol. 153:1202-1210) of the nontoxigenic
corynephage β197. Rappuoli reports yields of CRM197 from
double lysogens up to three fold higher than the single
lysogens. The production levels of CRM197 by single
lysogens are adequate but economically unsatisfactory for
the production of vaccines which utilize CRM197 protein. Introduction of multiple lysogens of the corynephage β
into Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a laborious screening
process for identifying strains that can overproduce the
CRM197 protein, diphtheria toxin or other CRM proteins that
are cross-reactive with diphtheria toxin. In addition, this
process is limited in its ability to manipulate protein
expression using standard recombinant techniques. It would
therefore be beneficial to develop a process that can
generate significant quantities of diphtheria toxin and CRM
proteins by increasing the gene copy number without the use
of corynephage β; or by increasing
