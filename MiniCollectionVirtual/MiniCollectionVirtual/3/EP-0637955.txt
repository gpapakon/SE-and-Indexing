-HAIR DYEING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISED OF 5,6-DIHYDROXYINDOLE AND A CHLORITE OXIDANT AND METHODS OF DYEING THEREWITH-RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation in part of commonly owned and co-pending application Serial Number 07/875,874 filed April 4 , 1992.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention concerns methods and compositions for dyeing human hair.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONModem hair dyeing methodology has developed from its initiation in the 1950s to the point where today it is the third largest product type in the hair care category, following shampoos and conditioners.One widely employed method for dyeing hair is based upon the production of the natural pigment melanin. The exact structure of melanin it not known. It is a polymer produced from tyrosine by a series of metabolic reactions the exact course of which remains to be clarified. To take advantage of what has been elucidated with respect to the formation of melanin, it 

has become the practice of the art to utilize 5,6- dihydroxyindole (DHI) or 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2- carboxylic (DHICA) as the dyeing agent. These compounds have been clearly established as intermediates in the pathway leading to the production of melanin.There are a number of problems associated with the use of DHI. It is difficult and expensive to synthesize and is extremely unstable in air. It rapidly decomposes in air to form other materials which are ineffective as hair colorants.Diacetoxyindole (DAI) is used by the art in its attempts to avoid these problems with DHI. The practice has been to package DAI under mildly alkaline conditions in packages designed to protect the ingredients from air. Over the course of the time, between the initial packaging and the final use, the DAI is hydrolyzed to DHI. Since it is protected from air by the packaging, the DHI remains stable until it is ready for use. 
It is known that use of DHI alone requires a long dyeout time. Therefore a variety of accelerators has been employed to hasten the dye formation. Oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide, are the most widely employed of the various accelerators which have been proposed.The use of oxidants has not been particularly successful with DHI, because oxidation takes place before the DHI penetrates the hair. Ideally, the DHI should penetrate the hair before oxidation takes place so that the pigment forms within the hair fiber. When the colorant forms in this manner, the color does not easily wash out. In contrast, if oxidation and melanin formation take place in the solution there
