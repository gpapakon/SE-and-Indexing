<ABSTRACT>
The temporal variation in the disturbing vibrations is stored with the aid of sensors (ax, ay, az) on the vibrating part of the coordinate measuring machine. Subsequently, the measured values of the sensors are computed together with previously determined and stored correction parameters which describe the natural frequency ( nu ) and the damping ( delta ) of the vibrations as well as the information on amplitude and phase which relates to the natural forms (Gr) of vibration which contribute to the disturbing vibrations. The vibration-induced measurement errors of the coordinate measuring machine are then calculated at the instant of touching from the temporal variation in the corrected measured values of the sensors (ax, ay, az).
