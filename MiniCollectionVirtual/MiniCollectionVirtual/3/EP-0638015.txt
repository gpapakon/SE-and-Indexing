<ABSTRACT>
A razor includes a handle and a cartridge (11) pivotally mounted thereon by a cartridge carrier (15). A four-bar linkage comprising links (16) and a pair of bell cranks (17A, 17B) mounts the cartridge carrier (15) to the handle so that a centre of rotation of the cartridge is on or below a surface (42) to be shaved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cartridge
razor which includes a handle and a cartridge
carrier mounted to the handle in a way which
allows the cartridge to rotate relative to the
handle about an axis which is perpendicular to
the edge of the or each blade of the cartridge
and parallel to the surface to be shaved,
thereby to accommodate changing contours of a
surface to be shaved.Twin-blade cartridges which swivel
about an axis parallel to the blade edges are
well-known. Such swivelling improves contact
between the blades and the surface being shaved,
and it has been found that the swivelling about
the orthogonal axis improves blade contact, end
to end. See GB-A-2116470 and GB-A-2172236.Although the razor of GB-A-2116470
provides improved conformance with facial
contours, end to end of the shaving cartridge,
there is scope for further improvement and it is
one object of the present invention to achieve
such an improvement. What is required is a way
of mounting the cartridge to the handle which
allows the cartridge to move smoothly and with a
minimum of friction about the axis perpendicular
to the blade edge or edges, whenever there is a 
change of the angle between the handle and the surface being
shaved. Further, the mounting should be compact enough not
to interfere unduly with the user's vision of the area being
shaved or with subsequent rinsing of the cartridge.According to the present invention, there is
provided a cartridge razor according to the claim 1.By so locating the rotation centre, it is possible
to establish a stable reaction to changing contours of the
surface being shaved, which ensures that the end to end
rocking movements of the cartridge do not involve any motion
in the line of the blade edges relative to that surface. Conventional swivelling movement parallel to the
edge of the or each blade of the cartridge is provided
between the cartridge carrier and the cartridge. Preferably,
the axis of rotation of the cartridge parallel to the blade
edges is also on or below the surface to be shaved. When
the two orthogonal rotational axes intersect, the
combination of the two swivel axes creates an effective
universal joint on or below the surface being shaved.The cartridge carrier itself is carried on a
four-bar linkage which lies in a plane parallel to the blade
edges. A suitable four-bar linkage has first and second
transverse links, each with a mid-point pivotally mounted to
the handle, and two opposite ends each pivotally mounted to
an extension link, itself mounted pivotally to the end of
th
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cartridge razor which includes a handle (18) and a
cartridge carrier (15) mounting a cartridge having blades

each with a blade edge extending lengthwise of the
cartridge, the blade edges defining a shaving surface

(42), and pivot bearings (12) to enable the mounted
cartridge to swivel about a first pivot axis

substantially parallel to the blade edges, said cartridge
carrier being mounted to the handle in a way which allows

the cartridge mounted on the carrier to rotate relative
to the handle, about a second pivot axis (41) which is

perpendicular to the edge of each blade of the cartridge
and parallel to the shaving surface (42) of the

cartridge, with changing contours of a surface to be
shaved,

characterized in that said second pivot axis (41) lies
either on or on the opposite side of the shaving surface

(42) of the cartridge from the razor handle (18), whereby
in operative disposition the second pivot axis (41) is

respectively on or below said surface to be shaved,
and that the cartridge carrier (15) is itself carried on

a four-bar linkage (16, 17) which lies in a plane
parallel to the blade edges.
A razor as claimed in claim 1,

wherein the four-bar linkage includes first and second
transverse links (17), each with a mid-point pivotally

mounted to the handle, and two opposite ends each
pivotally mounted to an extension link (16) itself

pivotally mounted to one end of the cartridge carrier. 
A razor as claimed in claim 2,

wherein the transverse links (17) are bell cranks.
A razor as claimed in claim 1,

wherein the cartridge carrier (15) is provided with a
cover surface (20) which moves with the carrier relative

to the handle, the cover surface having an arcuate edge
(21) which abuts a corresponding edge portion (22) of a

surface (23) of the handle, for relative sliding movement
between the said edges when the carrier moves relative to

the handle.
A razor as claimed in claim 1,

including biasing means (19) to urge the carrier to
rotate to a start disposition as soon as the carrier is

no longer subject to any shaving forces tending to
displace the carrier from said start disposition.
