<ABSTRACT>
The invention increases the tuning range of a laser 
(14) by altering the output coupler (16) reflectivity. In 

a first embodiment of the invention, the tuning range of 
an external cavity laser (27, 14, 24, 26) is increased by 

applying a substantially spectrally flat reflective 
coating (64, 66, 68) to the front facet (16) of a 

semiconductor laser (14) which has higher reflectivity 
than the uncoated front facet. In addition to increasing 

the tuning range, the increased reflectivity of the front 
facet reduces the laser threshold current for all laser 

wavelengths. In a second embodiment of the invention, 
various complex coatings (70, 72) were applied to the 

output coupler (40) to generate reflective 
characteristics that change according to wavelength. The 

complex coatings (40) enhance reflectance at the edges of 
the laser tuning curve without adversely affecting the 

output power at the center wavelengths. This further 
increases the tuning range of the laser while 

simultaneously maintaining high output power for each 
selected output wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to tunable lasers
and more particularly to enhancing the output
characteristics of an external cavity semiconductor
laser.Lasers can be designed so that only a single, narrow
wavelength of light is emitted upon activation. Many
applications, however, require laser systems that
generate variable discrete wavelengths (i.e., tunable
lasers). Tunable lasers have been developed and used for
years by scientists and engineers to study various
optical phenomena. For example, in communication
systems, optical fibers exhibit low loss at wavelengths
near 1.3 micrometers(µm) and 1.55µm. Research and
development in this area, therefore, require general
purpose lasers that can generate laser light in these
wavelength ranges.Conventional tunable lasers, however, such as the
external cavity semiconductor laser, color center laser,
and the tunable dye laser, do not reliably emit light
throughout the entire range of wavelengths required for
many present research and development applications (e.g.,
1.32±.1µm and 1.55±.1µm). Tunable dye lasers are
difficult to operate, are not commercially available, and
the dyes are not stable over time. Color center lasers
are available that can be tuned in a small wavelength
range around 1.5µm. However, the color center crystal 
must be kept at very low temperatures at all times to
avoid losing the optical properties that allow it to
produce laser radiation. Thus, color center lasers are
inconvenient and are not stable over a broad range of
environmental conditions. In addition, the color center
crystals used in present laser systems cannot generate
wavelengths near 1.3µm. External cavity semiconductor
lasers are available around both 1.3µm and 1.55µm, but
suffer from limited tuning ranges.In addition to limited tuning range, present tunable
lasers also have limited output power. For example, each
semiconductor laser has a threshold current which denotes
the amount of current required for the laser to
efficiently generate light (i.e., lase). Optically
pumped lasers also have threshold levels. Below
threshold, the light output is very inefficient, and most
of the energy from the drive current is lost as heat.
Light emission becomes much stronger above the current
threshold. This means more of the electrical or optical
input energy emerges from the laser as light energy.
When the laser threshold is high, more input power is
dissipated as heat, which tends to shorten laser
operating life and lower the peak output power.The threshold of a tunable laser
