<ABSTRACT>
In digital communication systems, such as FDMA/TDMA digital 
cellular 

mobile radio systems (1) in which a number of radio base stations 
transceivers (BS1,BS2,BS3) 

communicate with a number of mobile radio stations (MS1,MS2,MS3 ), 
frequency hopping techniques are used for combating fading inter alia. 

When implementing such frequency hopping techniques, data bursts 
have to be routed between transceivers (RFU1,RFU2, ...,RFUn) 

and transceiver 
controllers (RCC1,RCC2, ...,RCCn) in the radio base stations 

transceivers (BS1,BS2,BS3) according to a frequency hopping algorithm. 
In order to get a more fault tolerant system inter alia, 

point-to-multipoint structures (RXL1,RXL2, ...,RXLn;TXL1,TXL2, ...,TXLn) 
between transceiver receiver sections (RX1,RX2, .  ..,RXn) 

and transceiver controllers (RCRX1,RCRX2, ..., RCRXn), and between 
transceiver 

controllers (RCTX1,RCTX2, ...,RCTXn) and transceiver transmitter 
sections (TX1,TX2, ...,TXn) are proposed. In case of failure 

of a transceiver or a transceiver controller most of 
the current traffic can still be handled. Then, the system can 

simply be reconfigured to become fully operative again, 
though with a slightly reduced capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital communication system 
comprising at least one primary station arranged for frequency hopping based burst 
mode communication with a plurality of secondary stations, the primary station 
comprising a plurality of transceivers and a plurality of transceiver controllers which are 
coupled to the transceivers via a distribution medium. Such a system can be a digital 
cellular radio system in which the primary station is a radio base station and the 
secondary stations are mobile radio stations, or any other frequency hopping based 
digital communication system. The present invention further relates to a primary station for use in such a 
system. A digital communication system and primary station of this kind are 
known from the International Patent Application WO 90/16122. In this Patent 
Application a radio base station for use in TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) 
digital mobile radio systems is disclosed using frequency hopping techniques. The base 
station comprises a plurality of transceivers which are coupled to at least one antenna 
via a so-called combiner, and further a base station controller and a plurality of 
transceiver controllers. The transceiver controllers comprise channel codecs, speech 
codecs, and processors for handling signalling data or the like. For efficiently 
implementing a so-called baseband switching frequency hopping technique, the 
transceivers and the transceiver controller are coupled to a bus as a common distribution 
medium, the bus also being coupled to the base station controller. The transceiver 
comprises a receiver for receiving data such as voice data or other data from mobile 
stations and a transmitter for transmitting data to the mobile stations on a TDMA basis. 
Via the bus, when receiving, for particular mobile subscribers time slots e.g. containing 
bursts of digitally coded speech are directed to the correct transceiver controller as 
determined by a frequency hopping algorithm comprised in the base station controller,  
 
i.e. on a TDMA frame basis, each transceiver is connected with the correct transceiver 
controller. When transmitting a similar approach is taken. With baseband switching 
frequency hopping, the transceivers are tuned to fixed frequencies, the TDMA bursts to 
and from particular mobile subscribers having varying time slot positions within the 
TDMA frames. Such a bus structure as a common distribution medium is 
disadvantageous as to fault tolerance of the system. For a fault tolerant system,
