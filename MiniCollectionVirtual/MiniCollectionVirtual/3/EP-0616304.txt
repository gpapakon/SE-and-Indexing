<ABSTRACT>
The article-securing element (1) generates independently of its direction, and relative to a response field (5, 6) emitted by a transmitter coil, a response field which can be reliably detected by a receiver coil. For this purpose, the article-securing element (1) has a metal strip (3) of soft magnetic material, which is wound in the shape of a helical line onto an elongate, column-shaped carrier member (2) of non-magnetic material at an inclination angle  alpha which has a value of between 30@ and 60@.
