<ABSTRACT>
Process for bringing a gas stream and a liquid phase into contact, at least some constituents of the said gas stream being capable of being bound by the said liquid phase, the said process consisting in passing the gas into at least one zone containing the said liquid phase, the lower part of the said zone including a perforated plate (2), the gas stream being caused to pass through the said plate (2) from the bottom upwards, the said process being characterised in that the height of the said zone is maintained at a value higher than 200 mm and lower than 1 m and in that the total area of the perforations (8) in the said plate (2) is between 1/40 and 1/300 of the horizontal area available for the perforations (8).

<CLAIMS>
A process for contacting a gas stream with a liquid phase, certain
components at least of said gas stream being susceptible of being fixed by

said liquid phase, said process consisting in passing the gas through at least
one zone containing said liquid phase in order to implement fixing said

components in the liquid phase, the lower part of said zone comprising a
perforated plate, said gas stream being led to flow through said plate

upward, process in which the liquid height in said zone is kept between
200 mm and 600 mm, 300 mm to 400 mm being preferred, the total surface

of holes perforated through said plate is under 1/40 and over 1/300 of the
total horizontal surface area of the plate which is available for being

perforated, the individual surface area of the holes in the perforated plate is
in the range 0.5 mm
2
 to 3.5 mm
2
, and the gas stream containing the
components to be fixed is introduced with a flowrate corresponding to a

velocity in the range 0.185 m/sec to 1 m/sec, these figures corresponding to
air under atmospheric pressure and being capable to vary according to the

nature of the gas and its pressure.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the fixing
liquid phase is an aqueous medium.
A process according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that
the fixing liquid phase is a homogeneous liquid medium.
A process according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that
the fixing liquid phase is a heterogeneous liquid medium containing solid

particles in suspension.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the liquid phase comprises a catalyst, soluble or in suspension.
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that the catalyst
is a metal catalyst.
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that the catalyst
is an enzyme chosen among oxiding enzymes, peroxidizing enzymes,

proteases, lipases, carboxypeptidases and/or esterases.
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that the catalyst
comprises a culture of microorganisms. 
A process according to one of claims 7 or 8, characterized in that
the enzymes or the microorganisms are immobilized on solid particles in

suspension.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 9, characterized in
that the volume of the solid particle charge in the fixing zone is up to 75%

of the volume of said zone, this figure being related to the dry volume of
particles before loading.
A process according to claim 10, characterized in that the
volume of the solid particle charge in the fixing zone is within the range 50

to 70% of the volume of said zone, said volume of particles being their dry
volume before loading.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 11, characterized
in that the liquid of the fixing zone is circulated from an inlet zone to an

outlet zone.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 12, characterized
in that a number of fixing zones is used, the gas stream to be treated

flowing through said zones in succession.
The application of the process according to anyone of claims 1
to 13 for purification of industrial gaseous effluents or of air conditioning

loops.
Application of the process according to anyone of claims 1 to
13 for performing chemical or biochemical reactions,
