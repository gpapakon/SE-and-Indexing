<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for packaging, transporting and storing reels (coils) of continuous flexible material, such as polyester film. It relates more particularly to a device for positioning a reel of film equipped with polygonal cheeks mounted on the central core of the reel, for the purpose of storing it or transporting it, characterised in that it comprises at least one receiving and holding means 3, 4 for each cheek 11, 12 and at least one means 13, 14 for rendering a means 3, 4 for receiving or holding a cheek 11, 12 integral with the opposite means 3, 4 for receiving and holding the other cheek 11, 12. This device makes it possible to hold a reel and these cheeks during transportation thereof. It is easy to install and can be used for all types of reel. Furthermore, it is recoverable and returnable, and therefore complies with the new legislation relating to packaging.

<CLAIMS>
Device for positioning a film reel equipped with 
polygonal flanges fitted onto the mandrel of the reel, 

for the purpose of storing or transporting the said reel, 
characterized in that it comprises at least one receiving 

and holding means (3, 4) for one side of each flange (11, 
12) and at least one means (13, 14) for adjustably fixing 

one receiving or holding means (3, 4) for one flange (11, 
12) to the opposite receiving and holding means (3, 4) 

for the other flange (11, 12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 

that the receiving and holding means (3, 4) is formed by 
a bar (3, 4) having a plane bearing face (5, 6), for one 

side of the flange (11, 12), and at least one vertical 
wall (7, 10) coming into contact against that surface of 

the flange (11, 12) which is exterior to the reel. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the bar (3, 4) forming the receiving and bearing 

means has an L-shaped profile. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the bar (3, 4) forming the receiving and bearing 

means has a U-shaped profile, in which the side of the 
flange (11, 12) is accommodated. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the vertical walls (7, 8, 9, 10) of the U-shaped bar 

have different heights. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the vertical walls (7, 8, 9, 10) of the U-shaped bar 

are of equal height. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterized in that that face of the plane surface of 
the receiving and holding bar (3, 4) which is not in 

contact with the flange (11, 12) comprises non-slip means 
(17, 18). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the non-slip means (17, 18) are formed by protuberances 

projecting on the said face. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the non-slip means (17, 18) are grooves or ribs 

formed on the said face. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the means (13, 14) for fixing 

together two receiving and holding means (3, 4) consists 
of at least one rod. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the means (13, 14) for fixing 

together two receiving and holding means (3, 4) consists 
of at least one rod of adjustable length. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the rod (13, 14) of adjustable length is a 

telescopic rod. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises means for locking the 

said device on a supporting base (19). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it is secured to a supporting base 

removably or not. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises elements forming a 

supporting base and means for handling the assembly as a 
whole. 
Method for packaging a film reel comprising 
polygonal flanges fastened on a mandrel, characterized in 

that it involves bringing the lower side of each flange 
into the receiving and holding means of at least one 

device according to one of Claims 1 to 15, arranged on a 
supporting base, and fixing together the assembly 

consisting of the reel and of the positioning device of 
the supporting base.  

 
Method according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that it involves arranging at least one positioning 

device according to one of Claims 1 to 15 on the upper 
sides of the flanges. 
Method according to Claim 17, characterized in 
that it involves arranging a bar between the lower 

positioning devices and the upper positioning devices in 
order to form a means for holding the flanges on the 

mandrel of the reel.
