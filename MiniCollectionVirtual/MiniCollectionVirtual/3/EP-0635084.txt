<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
recovering fluid contaminants from a particulate medium. 
More specifically, the invention relates to methods and 
apparatus for recovering oil spills from beaches before 
volatiles have evaporated from the oil creating a material 
having a density significantly greater than water. Large quantities of oil are presently transported 
from oil-producing regions to oil-consuming regions by 
various means, including large sea-going vessels. As the 
number and size of such vessels increases, the probability 
of a large oil spill occurring, with its attendant, 
serious environmental consequences also increases. A 
number of such accidents have occurred which have resulted 
in contamination of beaches with possibly permanent 
environmental damage. Substantial progress has been made in the recovery of 
oil spilled on large bodies of water. Typically, the oil 
spill is surrounded by a floating boom to contain the 
spill. Conventional vacuuming and filtering equipment are 
then employed to remove the oil from the circumscribed 
area, as the oil will continue to float on the surface of 
the water as long as the more volatile components of the 
oil have not evaporated. Such efforts have proven 
effective as long as the oil remains at sea, the booms are 
quickly deployed, and the sea is not too rough. Recovering oil from beaches is substantially more 
difficult than recovering oil from the sea. The beach  
 
environment contains a large number of organisms which 
live on the beach, and below the surface of the beach to 
a depth of approximately one foot. In contrast, the upper 
layer of the ocean is a relatively "dead" ecological 
environment. Therefore, oil spills which have washed up 
on beaches generally cause significantly greater 
ecological damage than oil spills which are contained at 
sea. Unfortunately, no currently known technologies have 
been successful in recovering oil directly from beaches in 
an ecologically acceptable manner. Presently, the most 
effective method of cleaning oil contaminated beaches is 
to wash the spilled oil back into the ocean so that the 
boom and vacuum method described above can be employed. 
This technique is only successful if the oil spill is 
fresh (i.e., the volatiles have not evaporated). If the 
oil has begun to evaporate, the beach deposit becomes a 
heavy sludge which can only be washed off with steam or 
extremely hot water at high pressure. This combination 
destroys the beach and is injurious to the organisms which

A method for decontaminating a particulate medium (26) 
which has been contaminated with a fluid contaminate 

having a density less than water such as petroleum, 
comprising the steps of: 


irrigating the particulate medium (26) with sufficient 
water to saturate the medium (26); 
applying a high velocity air flow across a surface of 
the medium (26) and substantially normal thereto so as 

to develop a water column supporting a frothy mixture 
(32) of air, water and fluid contaminant; 
directing the air flow into an air/fluid separation 
chamber (67) without reducing the velocity of the air 

flow below a critical velocity so that droplets of the 
water and the fluid contaminant remain entrained in the 

air flow; 
reducing the velocity of the air flow within the 
air/fluid separation chamber (67) below the critical 

velocity so that the droplets of the water and the fluid 
contaminant fall into a fluid sump (80) and coalesce 

into a water/contaminant fluid mixture; and  
 
removing the water/contaminant fluid mixture from the 
fluid sump (80). 
The method of claim 1, including the steps of receiving 
the water/contaminant fluid mixture from the sump (80) 

in a fluid contaminant/water separator (86) which is 
physically distinct from the air/fluid separation 

chamber (67) and substantially separating the fluid 
contaminant from the water to produce relatively pure 

water and relatively pure contaminant. 
The method of claim 2, including the step of 
transferring the relatively pure contaminant to a 

storage chamber (114).

substantially saturated therewith unless the selected 

area is already substantially saturated;  
 
positioning a vacuum head (22) above the selected area 
and generating an air flow across and normal to the 

selected area so that a frothy mixture (32) of air, 
petroleum and water are drawn into the vacuum head (22); 
reducing the velocity of the air flow within the vacuum 
head (22) below a critical velocity so that water and 

petroleum droplets entrained in the air flow fall into a 
sump (80) to form a fluid mixture within the sump (80) 

and relatively pure air within the vacuum head; and 
expelling the relatively pure air from the vacuum head 
(22) and removing the fluid mixture from the vacuum head 

(22).
