<ABSTRACT>
With an image processor of the present invention, 
when a reduction mode is selected, image data of a 

document is stored, and whether the image data includes a 
character or not is detected. If no character is 

recognized, copying is performed. On the other hand, if a 
character is recognized, the character is reduced. 

Subsequently, the reduced character is re-recognized, and 
an unrecognized character rate is calculated. If the 

unrecognized character rate is smaller than a reference 
rate, copying is performed and the reduction mode comes to 

an end. On the other hand, if the unrecognized character 
rate is higher than or equal to the reference rate, a 

warning massage is displayed to show that reduction 
processing is unavailable so as to terminate the copying 

operation, or correct the reduced character while 
comparing the previously recognized character with the 

reduced character and start copying. With this structure, 
since the reduced image contains easily readable 

characters, the handling of the image processor is 
improved and its value is increased. Moreover, since only 

a practically usable reduced image is output, the waste of 
sheets is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processor,
such as a copying machine, a digital printer, a facsimile,
and a scanner printer, which outputs image data of a
document read by input means in original, reduced or
enlarged size.In recent years, image processors, for example,
copying machines capable of producing a copy of an
original document in original, reduced, or enlarged size
are widely used. Such a copying machine easily produces
reduced or enlarged copies of the original document by
magnifying the image of the document at a desired 
reduction or magnification rate. The copying machines of
this type are thus often used for copying various types of
documents, maps, or plans of machines and architecture.A so-called digital copying machine is widely used as
a copying machine of this type. The digital copying
machine reads a scanned image of a document by an image
pickup element, for example, a CCD (charge coupled device)
sensor, stores the image data in an image memory, and
outputs the image data, for example, after
reducing/enlarging the image. Since the image data of the
document is temporarily stored in the image memory, the
reduction/enlargement processing is easily performed on
the image data.However, for example, when producing a reduced copy,
the conventional digital copying machine merely reduces
the size of the entire image. Therefore, for example,
when the image of the document is reduced by the reduction
processing, the characters in the reduced document become
too small or the outlines of the characters become
unclear. In other words, reading the characters in the
document becomes unavailable, resulting in virtually
useless copies. Namely, although the conventional digital
copying machine easily processes the image data, it
performs poor functions, thereby having a rather low
value. Hence, the image processor such as copying machine 
is desired to have a developed structure capable of
preventing characters in a reduced copy from becoming too
small or unclear and of increasing the value of the image
processor.When a reproduction of a document is used as an
original document, i. e., when a copy is produced from a
reproduced image of the original, the image quality would
be degraded. If a copy is produced from such a degraded
document, the outlines of characters in the document
become unclear and cannot be read, resulting in a
virtually useless copy of the image. Thus, there is a
demand for developing an image processor which is capable
of preventing the characters in a document from
