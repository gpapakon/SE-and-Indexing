<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wear-resistant
composition comprising polymeric fillers and at least one
fluoropolymer.It is well-known in the art that fluoropolymers, such as
homo- and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), have
outstanding chemical and physical properties, in particular an
extremely low coefficient of friction in dry sliding contact
with metal, which make them ideal components in situation
which require operation with moving loaded contact, e.g. for
shaft bearings or piston rings, under dry conditions, ie
without the application of additional fluid lubricant, and/or
where the component is required to be as maintenance free as
possible over its lifetime under such dry conditions.
Examples of these include applications in domestic or
commercial machinery (including automotive and/or hydraulic
machinery). Such factors have lead to the rapid increase of
the use of fluoropolymer compositions in such applications.
However, the compositions known hitherto tend to suffer from a
disadvantageously high wear rate.GB-A-1 485 523 discloses a composition comprising 10-80 wt-% of fluorocarbon
polymer, 10-80 of polyphenylene sulfide and 10-80 wt-% of an aromatic polysulphone
in form of a dry mixture which may be used as a coating on rollers, stirrers or mixers.During dry sliding contact with a smooth metallic
surface such fluoropolymer compositions form a film on the
metal surface, and it is this film which dictates the
interfacial tribological (frictional and wear) behaviour which
is observed.The film takes a finite sliding distance to equilibrate
(known as the "break-in period"), and during break-in the
friction and wear rate can each be orders of magnitude higher
than at steady state. If the break-in period itself is
considerable, the wear during the break-in period can form a
significant part of the total.A reduction in the break-in period would clearly offer
an advantage.  It will be seen from the foregoing that there is a need
for a fluoropolymer composition which has in particular the
combination of
a) an extremely low steady state coefficient of friction in
dry sliding contact with metals, together withb) a very short break-in period before -the steady state
coefficient of friction and wear rate is achieved.Surprisingly, we have now found fluoropolymer
composition comprising polymeric fillers which combines the
above advantageous properties, and which make them ideal
materials for the above mentioned special applications.Accordingly, the present invention provides a solid
fluoropolymer
