<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antifogging abrasion
resistant coating composition and a synthetic resin article
coated therewith; and, more particularly, to silicone coating
composition for forming an abrasion resistant curable coating
on the surface of a resin substrate to prevent fogging which
may occur on the surface of the substrate, and to a synthetic
resin article coated with the inventive composition.Optical devices, when used in such diverse applications
as lenses, sunglasses, goggles, reflectors, and mirrors in
automobiles, frequently suffers from the fogging or misting
due to differences in the ambient temperature/humidity.Recently, as a substitute for glass, transparent plastic
materials having a superior fracture resistance have been
developed and used in automobiles, other optical devices and
the like. Since such plastic materials normally have a
lighter weight than glass, it is particularly attractive in
the field of transportation. Among these plastic materials,
polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylate are commonly 
employed. Particularly, polycarbonate is prefered due to its
high impact strength, high heat distortion temperature,
excellent dimensional stability and self-distinguishing
property, in addition to the fact that it can be easily
prepared. However, these plastic materials have a serious
drawback in that they can be easily scratched by cleaning and
weathering, which may cause deteriorate the transparancy and
aesthetic appreance thereof.Accordingly, many attempts have been made to prevent such
surface fogging of these transparent plastics and
simultaneously to impart the abrasion resistance property
thereto. For example, Japanese Patent Nos. 69247/1978,
55044/1979, 55048/1979, 88545/1979, 88637/1979, 102831/1980
and 22341/1981 disclose processes for reducing the surface
fogging of a resin substrate, which comprises applying a
surfactant to the surface or compounding a surfactant with the
resin during the preparation of the latter. However, these
methods have the limited ability of preventing the fogging and
improving the abrasion resistance.On the other hand, Japanese Patent Nos. 69678/1980,
86848/1980, 53070/1981, 239/1986, 6064/1988 and 172778/1988,
U.S. Patent No. 4,080,476 and European Patent No. 399,441
disclose compositions comprising a hydrophilic acrylic resin,
a radiation-curable (meth)acrylate and a surfactant, which are
intended to provide a cured coating having an improved
abrasion resistance and anti-fogging property. However, these 
compositions has a
