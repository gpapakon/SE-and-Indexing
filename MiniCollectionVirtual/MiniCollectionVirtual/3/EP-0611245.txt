<ABSTRACT>
A goods vehicle has a body 10 with upper and lower 
load-bearing floors 20 and 21 each mounted for vertical 

movement within the body. The upper floor 20 is raised 
and lowered by a hoist 22. Telescopic links 30 connect 

the two floors such that when the upper floor is less 
than a certain height above the lower floor it can move 

independently of the lower floor, but when the upper 
floor is lifted above such height it entrains the lower 

floor and the two floors move together. In another 
embodiment the two floors are fixed together for 

movement together over the full range of vertical 
movement of the upper floor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a goods vehicle, or a 
trailer for a goods vehicle, having more than one 
internal load-carrying floor or deck. For the purpose 
of this Specification, the term "goods vehicle" will be 
used to mean both goods vehicles and trailers for such 
vehicles. A two-deck trailer is advantageous as it provides 
more floorspace to enable more products to be carried, 
and for many products the payload is increased by up to 
65%. However, such a trailer is more difficult to load 
than a conventional trailer. Modern warehouses have a floor level which is about 
the same height as a trailer floor, for example about 
1200 mm above ground level. The loading dock may be a 
platform built outside the building to the same level 
as the internal floor, or it may be an opening in the 
wall of the building against which the rear of the 
trailer is reversed for loading or unloading. To load a trailer with two fixed floors from a 
loading dock requires that the trailer is fitted with a 
lift gate to lower the product from the upper floor to 
the level of the loading dock and vice versa, or else 
to be loaded by a forklift or similar away from the 
loading dock. Alternatively, an internal lift may be fitted 
allowing the trailer to be reversed against the loading 
dock but this means that the inward depth of the lift 
platform must be sacrificed from the rear of the upper 
fixed floor thereby losing load space.  If the lift gate is fitted externally then the 
trailer must be parked away from the loading dock by at 
least the length of the platform and is not desirable 
because it allows hot or cold outside air into the 
warehouse and also exposes the goods and the operating 
personnel to the weather. Trailers with an upper floor capable of being raised 
and lowered by screw jacks or hydraulic rams are also 
known. This allows the trailer to carry variable 
height loads on the upper or lower floor but the same 
difficulties exist when loading or unloading both 
floors at a loading dock. It is an object of this invention to provide an 
improved construction of goods vehicle. Accordingly, the present invention provides a goods 
vehicle comprising a body with upper and lower 
load-bearing floors each mounted for vertical movement 
within the body, hoist means for lifting and lowering 
one of the floors, and coupling means operative such 
that at least over part of the range of vertical 
movement of the said one floor the other floor is 
supported by the one floor for vertical movement 
therewith. In one

<CLAIMS>
A goods vehicle comprising a body with upper and 
lower load-bearing floors each mounted for vertical 

movement within the body, hoist means for lifting and 
lowering one of the floors, and coupling means 

operative such that at least over part of the range of 
vertical movement of the said one floor the other floor 

is supported by the one floor for vertical movement 
therewith. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the lower floor is rigidly connected to and supported 

by the upper floor for movement therewith over the full 
range of vertical movement of the upper floor. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the hoist means is arranged for lifting and lowering 

the upper floor, and the coupling means is operative 
such that when the upper floor is less than a certain 

height above the lower floor it can move independently 
of the lower floor, but when the upper floor is lifted 

above such height it entrains the lower floor and the 
two floors move together. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the lower floor is connected to the upper floor by 

extendable links such that when the links are less than 
fully extended the upper floors can move independently 

of the lower floor but when the links are fully 
extended the upper floor entrains the lower floor. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the extendable links comprise telescopic sections. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in claim 3, 4 or 5, 
wherein the vehicle is a trailer having a swan neck for 

articulated connection to a drivers cab, the swan neck 
defining a well within the body formed behind the lower 

bulkhead and between the wheel arches, the lower floor 
having a rest position within the well and being lifted 

from such rest position to move vertically within the 
well when entrained by the upper floor. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
the lower floor has sidewalls defining with the lower 

floor a tray whose external dimensions are 
approximately the same as the interior dimensions of 

the well. 
A goods vehicle as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wh
erein the hoist means comprises a pulley 
system operated by a single-acting hydraulic ram with 

double purchase mounted on the bulkhead.
