by introducing asymmetry into the spirocarbon atom of the above compound, and an optically functional material 

prepared therefrom. In said formula (1) R¹ represents C₁-C₂₀ alkyl, aralkyl, hydroxyethyl, methacryloxymethyl or 
methacryloxyethyl; R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ represent each independently hydrogen, C₁-C₆ alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, C₁-C₅ alkoxy, 

hydroxymethyl, carboxyl, halogen, amino, cyano, trichloromethyl, trifluoromethyl or nitro; R⁶ and R⁷ represent each 
independently hydrogen, C₁-C₆ alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, halogen, cyano or nitro; R⁸ represents C₁-C₆ alkyl, hydroxymethyl, 

carboxyl, methoxycarbonyl, methacryloxymethyl or vinyl; at least one of R¹ through R⁸ is substituted by a group 
functioning as an agent for optical resolution: and X represents oxygen or sulfur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spiropyran
compounds and optically active spiropyran compounds and their
use. The compound of the present invention is expected for use
in the fields of optical materials such as high-density
optical recording materials, optical filters, image forming
materials, non-linear optical devices, writable high-density
optical recording materials wherein non-destructive read-out
has been accomplished, photosensitive materials, non-linear
optical device and conversion of optical energy into dynamic
energy.Spiropyran compounds are most well-known as typical
organic compounds which reversibly colors or decolorizes upon
exposure to the energy of light or heat. Examples and
properties of these derivatives are described,
for example, in G.H. Brown, "Photochromism" (John Wiley &
Sons, Inc., 1971);
Journal of Polymer Science, Part A1: Polymer Chemistry,
Vol. 8, No. 9, 2361-2374 (1970); Chem.Abs. Vol. 110, No.
26, 240293f (1989) and Vol. 112, No. 4, 28271u (1990).
Spiropyran compounds have an asymmetric
center on a spirocarbon. However, all conventional spiropyran
compounds are perfect racemic modifications having an optical
purity of 0 %, and optically active spiropyran compounds
which exhibit specific properties of optical active substances
such as optical rotation have never been obtained. An object of the present invention is to provide spiropyran compounds and
optically active spiropyran compounds.The present invention provides a spiropyran compound represented by the
formula

wherein R1 is alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aralkyl, hydroxyethyl, methacryloxymethyl
or methacryloxyethyl; R2, R3, R4 and R5 are the same or different and
are each hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy having 1 to
5 carbon atoms, hydroxymethyl, carboxyl, halogen, amino, cyano, trichloromethyl,
trifluoromethyl or nitro; R6 and R7 are the same or different and are each hydrogen,
alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aryl, aralkyl, halogen, cyano or nitro; R8 is
hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, hydroxymethyl, carboxyl,
methoxycarbonyl, methacryloxymethyl or vinyl; at least one of the substituents R1 to
R5 and R8 having bonded thereto, through the hydroxy, carboxyl or amino groups of
said substituents, a residue of a reagent for optical resolution which reagent is
selected from (+)- and (-)-(trans)-2-benzamidecyclohexylcarboxylic acid, (+)- and (-)-(cis)-2-benzamidecyclohexylcarboxylic
acid, (+)- and (-)-1-phenylethanesulfonic
acid, (+)- and (-)-mandelic acid, (+)- and
