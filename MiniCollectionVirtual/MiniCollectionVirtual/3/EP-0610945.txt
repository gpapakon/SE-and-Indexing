<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for optically inspecting an article, 
includes an illuminating system, an imaging system, and 

rotatable polarizing devices including a polarizer (20) in the 
illuminating system, an analyzer (22) in the imaging system, and 

a phase compensator (66) in one of the systems. The illuminating 
system directs the light from the light source to the 

objective lens (8) along an axis which is parallel to, but is 
laterally displaced from, the axis of the objective lens (18), 

such as to illuminate the inspected article (14) with a cone of 
light (62) which is tilted at an angle relative to the axis (18) of 

the objective lens to thereby permit contrast enhancement of 
the illuminated inspected article by the null-ellipsometric 

effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus according 
to the preamble of claim 1 for optically inspecting 
articles in order to obtain maximum contrast, which preamble 
is based on WO-A-92/09880 which discloses an inspection system for providing high contrast images of two materials of an article to be inspected. The invention is particularly 
applicable for use in optical microscopes, in order to 
enhance the contrast between different materials or layers 
in the inspected articles, and the invention is therefore 
described below with respect to such an application. The optical microscope is a well known and widely 
used instrument for observing small objects and minute 
details of surfaces in a wide variety of fields. It is 
particularly useful for visual inspection of electronic 
products, such as integrated circuits, multi-chip modules, 
flat panel displays, and the like, all characterized by 
finely detailed surfaces. Several well known contrast enhancing techniques 
in microscopy use polarizers in the optical path. 
Accordingly, most commercially available microscopes may be 
equipped with a polarizer in the illuminating system, and an 
analyzer in the imaging system, with the polarizer rotatable 
around the illumination axis so that the orientation of the 
polarization axis is continuously variable within an angular 
range of about 90°. Such microscope illuminating systems 
may also include a phase compensator, or a phase retardation 
plate, which introduces a phase shift of 360° between the 
s- and p- polarization components. However, some important types of articles or 
workpieces are hard to inspect with the prior art 
microscopes because the known contrast enhancement 
techniques fail to yield adequate contrast. One type of 
such article is a glass substrate coated with an indium-tin 
oxide (ITO) patterned layer about 100 nm thick, overcoated  
 
with a polyimide (PI) film about 80 nm thick, which is used 
in liquid crystal displays (LCD). These articles should be 
inspected particularly for regions of possible absence of 
the polyimide film. However, no microscopic technique is  
 
known to the inventors which adequately differentiates 
between regions coated with such a thin layer, and uncoated 
regions. Another example of hard-to-inspect articles is 
silicon coated with a silicon dioxide layer of less than 
50 µm thickness, a common stage in the fabrication of 
microelectronic devices. However, the known microscopic 
techniques are unable to provide adequate contrast for 
examining the
