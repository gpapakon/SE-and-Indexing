<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid
management members for absorbent articles such as meat
tray liners, bed pads, baby diapers, sanitary napkins,
and adult incontinent pads.Disposable absorbent articles typically
comprise three basic components: a liquid permeable
topsheet that is located closest to the skin of the
wearer when the article is in use, an absorbent core,
and a liquid impermeable barrier sheet which is located
on the opposite side of the absorbent core. Other
components such as fastening tapes, leg and waist
elastics, etc. are also commonly used.The absorbent core receives and retains liquids
that pass through the liquid permeable topsheet and
typically comprises a batt of wood fluff fibers.
Superabsorbent materials, typically in powder form, are
often distributed within the absorbent core to enhance
its liquid holding capacity and liquid retention
properties.One problem associated with absorbent articles
is the inefficient utilization of the total absorptive
capacity of the absorbent core material. This is due
in part because absorbent articles normally have an
elongated rectangular or hourglass shape and the liquid
introduction or insult and spreading of liquid is often
confined to the central area of the absorbent core.Another problem associated with absorbent
articles is the inability of the absorbent core to
absorb liquids rapidly enough when large amounts of
liquid are discharged into the absorbent core over
short periods of time. This often results in
undesirable side leakage.To improve the liquid acquisition and lateral 
spreading properties of absorbent articles, many
products have utilized a wicking layer of tissue or
crepe. This wicking layer can be located between the
liquid permeable topsheet and the absorbent core, in
the center of the absorbent core, or in the absorbent
core in a location closer to the liquid impermeable
barrier sheet. However, tissue and crepe tend to
promote isotropic spreading of liquids. That is,
liquid tends to spread at similar rates in both the
lengthwise and width directions of the absorbent
article. As a result, in many instances where the core
is elongated the liquid will leak beyond the side edges
of the absorbent article before it has an opportunity
to spread to the ends of the absorbent core.Numerous other approaches have been suggested
for improving the liquid distribution and absorption
properties of absorbent articles. Most of these
approaches have involved the use of channels,
reservoirs, apertures, etc. that have been introduced
into the
