<ABSTRACT>
A packet transmission system (100) with
reduced transmission delays includes a

communications controller (110) and a plurality
of remote requesting units (112) requesting

packet transmission services. Each remote unit
(112) sequentially stores transmitted access

requests (302) in a memory queue (500) and awaits
a resource grant (306) from the communications

controller (110). Upon receipt of a granted
resource the remote unit (112) will apply the

granted resource to the oldest request (502)
stored in the queue (500) in order to transmit

data (310) to the communications controller
(110).
A separate and distinct aspect of the
transmission system (100) resides within the

communications controller (110). In response to
the receipt of a data packet (310) from a remote

unit (112), the communications controller (110)
identifies missing data within the data packet

transmission, determines whether communication
resources are available to support retransmission

of the missing data, and if so, transmits a
response to the requesting remote unit

identifying the missing data and simultaneously
granting sufficient resources for retransmission

of the missing data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to PCT Patent 
Application No. PCT/US94/02086 filed 25 
February 1994 and assigned to the assignee of 
the present invention. This invention is directed to a packet 
transmission system. In particular, this 
invention relates to a method for improving 
throughput by reducing transmission delays in 
a packet transmission system. Packet transmission service has been in use 
for some time and has traditionally been employed 
within communication systems such as wireless and 
wireline voice and/or data communications. Packet 
transmission service has also been used in 
association with digital communication systems 
which permit the efficient allocation of system 
resources via any of the well known access 
schemes, such as, for example, Time Division 
Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (FDMA), Code Division Multiple 
Access (CDMA) or any combination thereof. As will 
be appreciated, system resources may  
 
comprise radio frequency (RF) spectrum divided 
into communication channels to facilitate the 
transmission of user information. In a packet transmission system, there are 
several access procedures a requesting unit can 
initiate when attempting to obtain and utilize 
system resources. These access procedures inform 
the system which type of operation a requesting 
unit is attempting to perform. Such operations 
include but are not limited to, call origination, 
location reporting, registration and page 
response. The typical access procedure may be 
summarized as follows. A requesting unit 
transmits a system access request (request) over 
a request channel to a communications controller, 
starts a retry timer, and awaits a bandwidth 
grant message from the controller, informing the 
unit when and which channel is available for use 
to commence data transmission. If the 
communications controller fails to respond to the 
request before the retry timer expires, the 
requesting unit will reissue the request 
(duplicate request). This procedure will 
continue until the requesting unit either 
receives a valid assignment of a resource 
(grant), reaches a maximum number of retries, or 
a packet lifetime timer expires, informing the 
requesting unit to cease. Each request typically seeks from the 
communications controller sufficient 
communication resources to service a single 
packet of requesting unit information. As is 
known, a packet may require fragmentation 
(separation into a number of smaller portions)  
 
prior to being communicated over a
