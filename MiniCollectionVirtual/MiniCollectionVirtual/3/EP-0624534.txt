<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a device for handling workpieces supported on stackable pallets, with at least one gripper (7) which is moveable in two coordinate axes parallel to the pallets and which takes off the workpieces to be machined from the particular uppermost pallet (10a) of a pallet stack (10) and deposits machined workpieces at the vacancies of this pallet (10a) which have occurred as a result of the workpiece removal, and with a pallet-transfer apparatus between two pallet stacks (9, 10), this device being characterised in that the two pallet stacks (9, 10) are provided at a distance one above the other, in that the gripper (17) is moveable in the distance region between the two pallet stacks (9, 10), and in that the pallet-transfer apparatus consists of a lifting apparatus (3) for the lower pallet stack (10) and of a selectively retractable support (8) for the upper pallet stack (9), the greatest stroke of the lifting apparatus (3) extending at least as far as the support (8) for the upper pallet stack (9).
