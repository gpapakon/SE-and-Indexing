<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing metal from metal ores, in particular crude iron from iron ore. The point of the invention is that the carbon- and/or hydrocarbon-containing substances used for generating a reducing gas consist at least partially of plastic. When a metallurgical shaft furnace is used, in particular a blast furnace (1), the plastic is blown in a coarse-grained fluidised form into the blast stream in the hearth of the shaft furnance, the particle size of the plastic being predominantly in the range of 1-10 mm.

Process for producing metal from metal ores, in
particular pig iron from iron ore, in which the iron ore which

contains the metal oxide is brought into reaction contact with
a reducing gas which contains carbon and/or hydrogen or

compounds thereof, with the reducing gas having been obtained
previously from solid substances containing carbon and/or

hydrocarbon, with plastics material in comminuted and
fluidised form being injected as an agglomerate having a

fissured and hence large specific surface into the blast
current in the hearth of a metallurgical shaft furnace, in

particular a blast furnace (1), and the particle size of the
plastics material being within the range 1 mm to 10 mm.
Process according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the particles of plastics material are
conveyed by entrainment in the current, in particular at a

ratio of from 5 to 30 kg plastics material per 1 kg fluidising
gas, in particular air.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that the particle size of the plastics
material is predominantly in the region of 5 mm.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the plastics material is injected in
fluidised form into the air current by way of lances (18)

arranged in air nozzles (20) of a blast furnace (1).
Process according to Claim 4,

characterised in that all the lances (18) are fed with
fluidised particles of plastics material. 
Process according to Claim 4,

characterised in that some of the lances (18) are fed with
fluidised particles of plastics material and others with oil

or coal, with the lances (18) fed with particles of plastics
material and those fed with oil or coal being distributed in

uniform manner around the circumference of the blast tuyere
array between one another.
Process according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the injection pressure at the lances
(18) is from 0.5 · 10
5
 to 1.5 · 10
5
 Pa above the pressure within
the blast furnace (1).
Process according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the ratio of the flow rate to the
diameter of the lances (18) is sufficiently high to prevent

the plastics material from clogging the lances (18) (owing to
melting and adhesion) as a result of heat reflection, in

particular the flow rate is between 20,000 and 40,000 l/sec · m
preferably around 25,000 l/sec · m.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the mixed blast temperature is greater
than 1,100°C.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that when the quantity of plastics material
injected exceeds 70 kg per tonne of pig iron the blast current

is enriched with O
2
, in particular with a quantity of from 0.05
to 0.1%, preferably 0.08%, of O
2
 for every excess kg of
plastics material per tonne of pig iron.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
 
characterised in that the particles of plastics material are

fluidised and metered sequentially in separate devices (8, 9).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that the particles of plastics material are
fluidised and metered in a combined fluidising and metering

device (8, 19), with the injection pressure being adjusted
constantly in a manner dependent on the furnace pressure by

way of a rapid regulation loop (17).
Process according to Claim 12,

characterised in that a pressure-tight cellular wheel sluice
is used as the combined fluidising and metering device.
