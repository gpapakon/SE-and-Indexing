<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid crystal projection displays.Liquid crystal displays ("LCD's") and other devices in which the electro-optically
active element comprises liquid crystal material are well known. One
type employs an encapsulated liquid crystal structure in which a liquid crystal
composition is encapsulated or dispersed in a containment medium such as a
polymer. When a voltage corresponding to a sufficiently strong electric field is
applied via an electrode across the encapsulated liquid crystal structure (the
"field-on" condition), the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules therein is reoriented
in accordance with the field, so that incident light is transmitted.
Conversely, in the absence of such a voltage (the "field-off" condition) the
alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is random and/or influenced by the
liquid crystal-matrix interface, so that the structure scatters and/or absorbs
incident light. The applied voltage at which the structure changes from its field-off
condition to its field-on condition is generally referred to as the threshold
voltage. Such devices can be used in displays, architectural partitions,
automobile sun-roofs, privacy screens, and signs.Among the displays are projection displays, in which the encapsulated
liquid crystal structure forms an element which is used to control the projection
of light onto a screen, such as an overhead projector for transparencies, or a
projection television. Exemplary disclosures include Fergason, US 4,613,207
(1986), 4,693,557 (1987), and 5,016,984 (1991); Williams et al., WO 90/05429 (1990);
and Flasck, US 5,022,750 (1991) and 5,024,524 (1991).
EP-A- 362 776 discloses a colour liquid crystal
projector based on encapsulated liquid crystal elements.Naturally it is desirable to have as high a contrast ratio as possible. The
scattering effect is particle size dependent, so that at the smaller median volume
diameters at which the contrast ratio is useful, there is more scattering of light
in the higher blue and green frequencies and less scattering in the shorter red
frequencies, with the effect that the display appears unpleasantly reddish or
brownish. This effect is most noticeable at intermediate voltages at which the
display is not fully in the field-on or the field-off conditions, as for example when 
grey levels are being displayed, because off-neutral Grays are more noticeable than
off-neutral black.A related problem exists in coloured displays, where separate elements
comprising encapsulated liquid crystal structures

<CLAIMS>
A liquid crystal projection display, comprising

(a) light source means (82) for producing light of at least two different
primary colors (r,g,b);
(b) an image forming means (91,92,93) corresponding to each primary color light
produced by the light source means, each image forming means

comprising plural picture elements, each picture element comprising
liquid crystal material dispersed in plural volumes in a

containment medium and being independently addressable to
primarily scatter light incident thereon in the absence of a

sufficient electric field and to primarily transmit light incident
thereon in the presence of a sufficient electric field; and
(c) lens means (94) for projecting light transmitted by each image forming
means onto a screen;

characterised in that the liquid crystal composition in the picture elements of the image forming
means (91) corresponding to the primary color light of longest wavelength

includes a pleochroic dye of a color complementary to the primary color
light of longest wavelength, which pleochroic dye preferentially absorbs

unscattered light in the absence of the sufficient electric field and
transmits such light in the presence of the sufficient electric field.
A liquid crystal projection display according to claim 1, wherein the light
source means comprises a white light source and dichroic mirror means (85-90)

for splitting the white light produced by the white light source into at least
two primary colors.
A liquid crystal projection display according to claim 1, wherein the light
source means comprises a plurality of primary light sources, each

producing light of a different primary color.
A liquid crystal projection display according to any of claims 1-3, wherein
the light source means produces light of three primary colors.
A liquid crystal projection display according to claim 4, wherein the
primary colors are red, blue, and green.
A liquid crystal projection display according to claim 5, wherein the
pleochroic dye is a cyan dye. 
A liquid crystal projection display according to claim 5, wherein the
pleochroic dye has an absorption maximum in between 550 nm and 700 nm.
A liquid crystal projection display according to claim 4, wherein the liquid
crystal composition in the image forming means (92) corresponding to the primary

colour of second longest wavelength includes a pleochroic dye of a colour
complementary to the primary colour of second longest wavelength, which

pleochroic dye preferentially absorbs unscattered light in the absence of the
sufficient electric field and transmits such light in the presence of the sufficient

electric field.
