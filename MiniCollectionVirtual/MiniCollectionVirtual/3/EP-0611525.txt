Process for the manufacture of a longlife, and 
anti-regurgitation infant milk, which consists: 


in preheating, then homogenizing an infant milk, 
then, in treating this milk at ultra high temperature 
(UHT), 
finally, in packaging under aseptic atmosphere in 
sterile packages, 
characterized
 in that before the homogenization stage, 
there is introduced into the milk from 0.3 to 1%, 

calculated by weight of the packaged sterile milk, a 
thickening agent chosen from the group comprising carob, 

guar, carrageenans and pectins, alone or mixed with each 
other. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the thickening agent introduced is carob. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the carob is introduced at room temperature and with 

vigorous stirring (more than 1000 revolutions/minute) 
in the form of an aqueous solution containing 

10 to 35 grams/liter of carob. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the carob is introduced in powdered form in an 

amount of 5 to 8 grams/liter of infant milk. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the aqueous carob solution is stirred continuously 

before being sent upstream to the homogenizer. 
Process according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the carob is previously dissolved 

at room temperature in deionised water, with a stirring 
rate of at least 1000 revolutions/minute. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that 0.5 to 0.8% carob is introduced. 
Process according to one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that the carob is introduced just before 

the preheating stage which precedes the homogenization. 
Longlife and anti-regurgitation infant milk, 
obtained by the implementation of the process according 

to one of claims 1 to 8.  
 
Infant milk according to claim 9, characterized 
in that it is provided in liquid form.
