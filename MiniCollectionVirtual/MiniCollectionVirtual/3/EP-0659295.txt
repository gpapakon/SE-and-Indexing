<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a container (1) with transparent walls and an opening (2) which is narrower than the interior space and with an advertising medium (4) that has letters, numbers, symbols or two- or three-dimensional representations. To provide for an individual formulation of the advertising statement conveyed by the advertising medium while ensuring that the container (1) presents a consistent, recognizable image, the invention proposes that the advertising medium (4) be arranged within the container (1) at a distance from its walls and be fixed in place within this interior space. If the container (1) is a perfume bottle, the advertising vehicle (4) is preferably combined with the suction tube (7) of a spray pump (6) on the cap (3).

A container (1) for the storage and transportation of liquids, in 
particular a perfume bottle, having transparent walls and an opening which 

is reduced in relation to the internal space and which is closed by a 
closure means (3) with an atomiser pump (6) whose suction intake tube (7) 

projects into the internal space of the container, characterised in that the 
suction intake tube (7) is connected to an advertising carrier (4) which has 

letters, digits, symbols or two- or three-dimensional representations and is 
fixed in position to the suction intake tube (7) at a spacing relative to

can be alternatively connected to various suction intake tubes (7a, 7b, 7c). 
A container according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
advertising carrier (4) comprises elastic material which after deformation 

thereof on passing through the opening (2) is deployed to its original form 
in the internal space in the container (1).
