<ABSTRACT>
A demand value for use in breathing apparatus, 
and comprising a housing 1 in which is mounted a 

diaphragm 2 such as to divide the interior of the 
housing into two separate chambers 3,4. Chamber 4 is 

vented to atmosphere through a hole 14; chamber 3 is 
connected via a pipe 13 to a gas outlet whereby 

breathing gas may be supplied to a face piece or mask 
for a user. Breathing air is supplied from a main 

gas supply channel 8 via a main valve 9,10 to a gas 
supply channel 6. A gas inlet channel 5 connects the 

supply channel 6 to the chamber 3 under the control of 
a needle valve 11 which closes an orifice 7. The 

head 11B of the needle valve is urged by a spring (not 
shown) into contact with the diaphragm 2 and thus the 

movement of the diaphragm controls the opening and 
closing of the needle valve. The diaphragm 2 is 

pivoted about spaced pivot members 15, and leaf 
springs 16 are used to maintain the diaphragm in 

contact with the pivot members 15. A leaf spring 17 
acts to push the diaphragm about the pivot members in 

a direction such as to tend to close the needle valve 
11.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve for use 
in breathing apparatus and more particularly to a 
demand valve. From U.K. Patents Nos. 2 190 001, 2 195 900, 2 
234 368 and 2 239 328 there is known a valve for use 
in breathing apparatus which includes a housing having 
a diaphragm mounted therein to define with the housing 
two chambers, a first one of which has a gas inlet for 
receiving breathing gas and a gas outlet through which 
breathing gas may be supplied to a face piece or mask 
for a user. The second chamber includes pivot means 
eccentrically mounted such that the diaphragm is 
pivoted at a position between its centre of gravity 
and the gas inlet to the first chamber. The second 
chamber is vented direct to atmosphere, and , when a 
pressure sufficiently greater than atmospheric 
pressure is present in the first chamber, the 
diaphragm is pivoted to close the gas inlet against 
the pressure of the inflowing gas. A reduction of 
pressure in the first chamber when inhalation 
commences causes the diaphragm to pivot away from the 
gas inlet and allow gas to flow into the first 
chamber. The known valve as described in outline above 
may be a demand valve per se or may be a pilot valve 
used in conjunction with a main valve as a pilot-operated 
demand valve. The first chamber of the known 
valve may additionally include spring means located at 
or near the gas inlet, the spring means exerting a 
biasing force on the diaphragm to ensure that the 
closing pressure required in the first chamber for 
pivoting the diaphragm to close the gas inlet is 
always sufficiently greater than the atmospheric 
pressure. Such a biasing spring is usually employed  
 
when the valve is a pilot valve and 
the pressure exerted on the diaphragm is a low 
pressure resulting from the small gas inlet to the 
first chamber which is the pilot jet. The valves described in the aforesaid patents 
are all positive pressure valves because the pressure 
required in the first chamber to close the gas inlet 
is always greater than atmospheric pressure as 
discussed above. Positive pressure valves are used in 
protective respiratory systems where the user is 
isolated from the atmosphere by a face mask or other 
sealing means, and the positive pressure in the system 
ensures that any leakage past the sealing means is 
leakage from the protective system to atmosphere. 
However, in other applications, for example medical 
demand regulators, the outlet of the demand regulators 
is open to atmosphere for a substantial part of the 
time

<CLAIMS>
A valve for use in breathing apparatus comprising a housing 
(1), a diaphragm (2) mounted within the housing and, together with the 

housing, defining a first chamber (3) on one side of the diaphragm and a 
second chamber (4) on the other side of the diaphragm, a gas inlet (5) to 

the first chamber, a gas outlet (13) from the first chamber, vent means (14) 
in the housing connecting the second chamber to ambient atmosphere, 

pivot means (15) in the first chamber for engaging the diaphragm on a 
pivot axis between the centre of gravity of the diaphragm and the gas inlet, 

said valve being characterised by first spring means (16) mounted to the 
housing within the second chamber (4) and extending into engagement 

with the opposite side of the diaphragm to the pivot means (15) and 
applying to the diaphragm a force directed toward the pivot axis to maintain 

the diaphragm (2) in engagement with the pivot means, and further spring 
means (17) mounted to the housing (1) and extending into the first 

chamber (3) into contact with the diaphragm at a position on the opposite 
side of the pivot means to the gas inlet (5) and urging the diaphragm to 

pivot so that the part of the diaphragm on the same side of the pivot means 
as the gas inlet is moved in a direction to close the gas inlet (5) whereby 

the gas inlet (5) is closed by the diaphragm at a pressure below 
atmospheric pressure. 
A valve according to Claim 1 further comprising adjustment 
means (19,20) for adjusting the further spring means (17) to vary the 

moment about the pivot exerted by the further spring means. 
A valve according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the first 
spring means is first leaf spring means (16).

and movable into and out of sealing engagement with the orifice, and a 

head (11b) extending from the main body into the first chamber into 
contact with the diaphragm (2) whereby the diaphragm causes the needle 

member to move the needle into sealing engagement with the orifice (7) 
when the moments exerted on the diaphragm by the pressure in the first 

chamber and by the adjustable leaf spring means (17) exceed the 
moments exerted on the diaphragm by the pressure in the second 

chamber and by the additional leaf spring means (21).
