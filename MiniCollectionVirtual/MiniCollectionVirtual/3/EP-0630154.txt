<ABSTRACT>
To provide an image which is matched with an 
aspect ratio of a screen of a display unit by compressing 

and enlarging the whole of the image to a desired size. 
A video signal is sequentially written into a field 

memory in response to a write clock from an input 
terminal (118). A clock generating circuit (119) 

supplies the field memory (103) with a read clock having 
a frequency which is about 4/3 times as high as that of 

the write clock. A vertical enlargement control circuit 
(110) reads a video signal from the field memory (103) 

with a line period corresponding to a magnification 
factor and inhibits writing to a one-line memory (105) 

with the same period to provide a line delayed output for 
an output signal from the field memory (13). A vertical 

interpolating circuit (106) generates a scanning line 
signal by an interpolation operation in accordance with a 

control signal from the vertical enlargement control 
circuit (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital
processing of video signal and in particular to an image
compressing and enlarging circuitry which is capable of
displaying an image on a screen without giving disparity
feeling by compressing and enlarging an image to a
desired size to match the aspect ratio of the screen of a
display even if the aspect ratio of the image obtained by
a video signal is different from the aspect ratio of the
screen of the display.Test broadcasting of high definition TV has
started since 1991 in Japan and the home TV sets with a
screen having an aspect ratio of 16:9 has begun to be
spread. Matching of the TV sets including a screen
having an aspect ratio of 16:9 with the conventional TV
broad casting is a critical factor of prevailing. It is
a great problem how the aspect ratio of the image of
the broadcast is changed into 16:9. If an image having
movie size which is commonly found in a number of recent
movie software packages, that is, so-called letter box
type image (the aspect ratios of the image are various)
in which the aspect ratio of the whole image is 4:3 and
there are blanking areas on upper and lower sides of a 
screen is displayed on a display with a screen having an
aspect ratio of 16:9, an aspect ratio which is
approximate to 16:9 could be obtained by enlarging the
image in a vertical direction. Therefore, enlargement of
images in a vertical direction has become an critical
technology.JP-A-1-194784 discloses a combined method
including a method of adapting an image having an aspect
ratio of 4:3 onto a screen having an aspect ratio of 16:9
by changing the write frequency of a line memory and the
read frequency thereof to compress the image in a
horizontal direction and a method of enlarging the image
in a vertical direction by changing the amplitude of an
output of the deflecting circuit for cutting the upper
and lower areas of the image.JP-A-3-11891 discloses a technology for enlarging
an image in a vertical direction by digital signal
processing. The proposed circuit configuration for
interpolating scanning lines using digital signal
processing to enlarge the image in a vertical direction
is shown in Fig. 1.In Fig. 1, reference numerals 201 and 202
denote input and output terminals of digitalized video
signal, respectively; 203 a memory having a capacity of
at least about 120 lines; 204 one-line memory; 205 and
206 ROM tables which are used for multiplying an input
signal by a coefficient; 207 an adder; 208 an input
terminal of a control signal for the memory 203;
