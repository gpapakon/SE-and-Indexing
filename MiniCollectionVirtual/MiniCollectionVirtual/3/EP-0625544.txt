<ABSTRACT>
Reinforced polymer composites having a 
thermoplastic matrix material, reinforcing glass 

fibers, and a heat-expandable material selected 
from a group consisting of unexpanded vermiculite 

and unexpanded perlite are provided exhibiting 
improved fire resistant properties. The composites 

are prepared by performing a dilute aqueous slurry 
of a solid heat-fusible organic polymer, glass 

reinforcing fibers, and a heat-expandable material 
selected from the group consisting of vermiculite 

and perlite, agitating the slurry and then 
dewatering the slurry to provide a mat of 

thermoplastic polymer particles, reinforcing glass 
fiber, and a heat-expandable material. The mat is 

dried and then stamped under pressure and heat to 
consolidate the thermoplastic material to form a 

sheet-like composite structure. The composites 
exhibit reduced levels of early smoke generation 

and/or early heat generation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flame 
resistant fiber reinforced thermoplastic 
composites, and more particularly relates to flame 
resistant thermoplastic composites having 
reinforcing glass fibers and a heat-expandable 
material. Thermoplastic composites having reinforcing 
materials and aqueous methods for making such fiber 
reinforced composite materials from an aqueous 
slurry of solid polymer and reinforcing material 
are known, see Published European Patent 
Applications 0,148,760 and 0,148,761, Wessling et 
al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,470 issued January 17, 
1984, and Gatward et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,716,449 
issued February 13, 1973, all of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. In general these 
reinforced polymer composites have a uniform 
mixture of fiber, polymer and optionally binder and 
are prepared by performing dilute aqueous slurries 
of a solid heat-fusible organic polymer, a 
reinforcing material and optionally a latex binder. Reinforcing materials disclosed have included 
organic and inorganic products such as graphite, 
metal fibers, aromatic polyamides, cellulose and 
polyolefin fibers, and typically have included 
glass fibers such as chopped glass strands having a 
length of 1/8 to 1 inch (about 3.2 to 25.4 mm) or 
milled glass fibers which generally have a length 
of about 1/32 to 1/8 inch (about 0.79 to 3.2 mm).  
 
While these composites which are prepared by the 
above described method exhibit levels of flame 
resistance as measured by OSU performance tests for 
heat release and smoke release, there is a 
continuing desire to improve the flame resistance 
performance of such composites. This invention provides flame resistant 
thermoplastic composites comprising a thermoplastic 
matrix material, reinforcing glass fibers, and a 
heat-expandable material, wherein the composites 
are prepared by a process comprising forming a 
dilute aqueous slurry of a solid, water-insoluble 
heat-fusible organic polymer in particulate form, 
reinforcing glass fibers, and a heat-expandable 
material selected from the group consisting of 
perlite particulates and vermiculite particulates. 
The thermoplastic matrix material is a heat-fusible 
organic polymer, and is present at a level 
sufficient to act as a thermoplastic matrix in the 
composite and not merely as a binder material. The 
flame resistant thermoplastic composites exhibit 
reduced levels of heat release and smoke release as 
measured by OSU performance tests. The fire resistant thermoplastic composites of 
this invention have
