<ABSTRACT>
In a method of making a layered product of at least one metal layer and at least one layer of flexible graphite, an indissoluble bond between the graphite and the metal is produced without using mechanically acting anchorage aids and without the use of one of the known adhesives: initially, a surface-active substance from the group of the silicon-organic compounds, perfluorinated compounds or metal soaps is applied in a thin layer to at least one of the surfaces to be bonded, and the surfaces to be bonded are then contacted and bonded to one another by the action of pressure and heat.
