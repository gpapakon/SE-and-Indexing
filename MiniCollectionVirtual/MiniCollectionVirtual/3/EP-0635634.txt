<ABSTRACT>
An air intake heating system and method for use in a Diesel engine having 
a battery (19) and alternator (27) is provided for minimizing white 

smoke emissions without excessively depleting the engine battery (19) at 
low engine speeds wherein the battery (19) and not the alternator (27) is 

the principal contributor of power to the air intake heater (3). The system 
generally comprises an electrically powered heater assembly (3) for heating 

the intake air of the engine, a power regulation circuit electrically connected 
between the battery (19) and the alternator (27) of the engine and 

the heater assembly (3), a rotational speed sensor (47) and a temperature 
sensor (49), and a CPU (35) connected to the output of the speed and temperature 

sensors (47, 49) and the power regulation circuit for admitting 
a first, relatively low level of power to the heater assembly (3) at low 

engine speeds where the battery (19) is the primary source of power 
for the assembly (3), and a second, higher level of power when the engine 

speed is high enough so that the alternator (27) becomes the principal 
contributor of power to the heater assembly (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to air intake heating systems for internal combustion 
engines, and is specifically concerned with an air intake heating system according to 
the preamble of claim 1 and with a method for heating the intake air of an internal 
combustion engine according to the preamble of claim 10. Air intake heating systems and methods for reducing white smoke emissions of diesel 
engines during cold start-up conditions are known in the prior art. The purpose of 
these systems is to reduce the generation of white smoke when a diesel engine runs 
under no load or light load conditions at low temperature. Such white smoke is the 
result of unburned hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust and is attributable to the incomplete 
combustion of the diesel fuel in some or all of the engine cylinders due to 
misfiring. While white smoke is not a regulated exhaust emission, it is a respiratory 
and optical irritant and can have an adverse effect on driver visibility. Such an air intake heating system and method as initially mentioned are disclosed in 
US - A - 5,094,198. In this system a microprocessor has an input that receives a signal 
from an intake manifold air temperature monitoring sensor, and an engine speed monitoring 
sensor, and an output that controls the actuation of electrically powered air 
heating elements that are actuated and deactuated to heat the intake air. The pattern 
of actuation and deactuation of the electrical air heating elements is dependent upon 
a combination of sensed engine operation, sensed intake manifold air temperature and 
sensed battery condition. Depending upon whether the speed sensor indicates that 
the engine is in a cranking state, a running state, or a warmed state, the microprocessor 
of this system will admit different amounts of power to the heating elements. While the air intake heating device disclosed in the '198 patent functions well in 
small, direct injection diesel engines used in marine applications, the applicants have 
observed some areas where such a device might be improved when applied to later-generation 
diesel engines of the type used to drive tractor trailers and other heavy 
equipment. Specifically, while the applicants observed that the system disclosed in 
the '198 patent was capable of substantially reducing white smoke emissions in such  
 
engines under cold weather conditions, it did so by making large demands on battery 
output. Since the battery used in such engines generally cannot be recharged by the 
engine alternator when
