<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to plasma 
arc cutting torches and their method of operation. 
More specifically, it relates to a nozzle 
and related method of operation particularly useful in 
high definition torches. Conventional plasma arc cutting torches 
produce a transferred plasma jet with current density 
that is typically in the range of 31.0 x 106 to 62.0 x 106 
A/m2 (20,000 to 40,000 
amperes/in2). High definition torches are 
characterized by narrower jets with much higher 
current densities, typically about 93.0 x 106 A/m2 (60,000 amperes 
in2). High definition torches are desirable since 
they produce a narrow cut kerf and a square cut 
angle. They also have a thinner heat-affected zone 
and are more effective in producing a dross-free cut 
and blowing away molten metal. One problem with high definition torches is 
the need to cool the nozzle very efficiently. A cold 
nozzle wall at the nozzle exit orifice produces a thin 
boundary layer of cooled gas. This protects the 
nozzle and pinches the arc, that is, causes the arc to  
 
contract by this energy drain from its boundary. In 
order for the plasma arc to maintain enough charge 
carriers (ionization) to continue to conduct 
electrical current, the plasma arc will react to the 
constricting by increasing its centerline temperature 
and thus its ionization rate. This cooling is also 
important to control double arcing and gouging of the 
nozzle orifice, which occurs when the arc contacts the 
wall. Water cooling has proven effective in achieving 
the necessary degree of cooling. Another problem is that even though the gas 
pressure and density in the plasma chamber are more 
than twice the values of these parameters in 
conventional torches, the mass flow rate is still 
lower than that in conventional torches. This is 
caused by the necessarily small diameter nozzle 
orifice of a high definition nozzle, which quickly 
chokes the plasma gas, yeilding a very low mass flow 
rate. These conditions choke the flow of plasma gas 
out of the torch. The low mass flow rate of the choked 
flow produces at least three other problems. First, the low mass flow rate destabilizes 
the point of attachment of the arc on the electrode, 
or more precisely, on the hafnium or zirconium insert 
at the lower end of the electrode. As a result, the 
insert exhibits a severe random pitting rather than an 
even, parabolic wear pattern. The life of the 
electrode is therefore reduced. Also, as the point of 
attachment shifts over the insert, the entire arc 
column
