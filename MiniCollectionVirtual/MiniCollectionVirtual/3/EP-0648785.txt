<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of carboxyl-containing copolymers of ethylene by polymer-analogous pyrolytic ester cleavage of copolymers, comprising     a) from 60 to 99.9 mol% of ethylene, b) from 0.1 to 40 mol% of (C4- to C8-tert-alkyl) esters of copolymerisable C3-C12-carboxylic acids and   c) from 0 to 20 mol% of further copolymerisable monomers by carrying out the pyrolytic ester cleavage at temperatures of from 150 to 250 DEG C in the presence of organic sulphonic acids, in the absence of a solvent and in the virtual absence of initiators for free-radical reactions.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of carboxyl-containing
copolymers of ethylene by polymer-analogous pyrolytic ester

cleavage of copolymers composed of

-C
8
-tert-alkyl esters of
copolymerizable C
3
-C
12
-carboxylic acids and
c) from 0 to 20 mol% of further copolymerizable monomers,

wherein the pyrolytic ester cleavage is carried out at from
150 to 250°C in the presence of organic sulfonic acids, in

the absence of a solvent and at a concentration of free
radical initiators of up to 1 mol ppm.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polymers are
pyrolyzed in the course of from 0.5 to 5 minutes at from 180

to 220°C.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the pyrolysis
is carried out in an extruder.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
copolymers which are composed of


a) from 90 to 99.9 mol% of ethylene,
b) from 0.1 to 10 mol% of C
