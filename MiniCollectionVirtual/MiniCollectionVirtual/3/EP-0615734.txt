<ABSTRACT>
An orthotic caliper having at least two lockable steels 
(10, 12) for attachment to the respective limb members of the 

human body and having a locking pivotal connection (14, 16, 18) 
between the steels, characterised by a releasable locking member 

(24) which can be loaded in compression by the steels and which 
acts directly on at least one of the steels (10, 12), and 

preferably on both of them, to lock them in a desired position 
when so loaded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to orthotic calipers comprising 
at least two pivotally-connected "steels" for attachment to the 
respective limb members of the human body. It is especially 
concerned with calipers provided with locking knee joints. In GB-A-2,260,083 we have described an orthotic caliper 
of the construction outlined above having a pivotal connection 
between the two steels which is adapted to be held in a specific 
locked position by a releasable catch. In a particular 
construction illustrated in that Specification the pivotal 
connection takes the form of locking links which do not go 
overcentre, while the releasable catch takes the form of a hook 
having an angled engagement to take up play in the linkage formed 
by the locking links. The present invention constitutes a development of that 
described in GB-A-2,260,083. 
Furthermore US-A-4,732,143 and EP-A-0,016,268 
describe orthotic calipers having a releasable member which 
operates to hold the steels against undesired movement relatively 
to each other. Accordingly, the preamble of claim 1 is drawn to 
an orthotic caliper based on 
US-A-4,732,43, with the characterising portion 
of claim 1 being directed to a releasable locking member which is 
free to move in its released state so as to permit it to abut 
both steels in order to lock the 
steels against rotation in both directions 
with respect to each other. Preferred features of the invention are disclosed in 
the subsidiary claims. In order that the invention might be thoroughly 
understood, a specific example of an orthotic caliper in 
accordance with it will now be described with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a part-sectional side view of the main  
 
portion of the caliper; Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but with the two 
steels of the caliper at an obtuse angle with respect to each 
other; and Figure 3 is a view similar to Figures 1 and 2 but with 
the two steels at an acute angle with respect to each other. The orthotic caliper shown in the drawings comprises 
an upper steel 10 and a lower steel 12 which are provided with 
straps (not shown) or other fastening means whereby the steels 
can be attached to respective limb members of the human body. 
Normally the caliper would be used for attachment to the limb 
members of a leg, the upper steel 10 being attached to the thigh 
of the leg and the lower steel 12 being attached to the shin of 
the leg. The two steels 10 and 12 are pivotally connected 
together by a single link 14, the link 14
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An orthotic caliper having at least two steels (10, 12) 
for attachment to the respective limb members of the human body 

and having a pivotal connection (14, 16, 18) between the steels 
which comprises two spaced-apart pivot points (16, 18) so that the 

joint has dual pivots and which allows the steels to rotate relatively to each other in 
order that they may take up a variety of angular positions with 

respect to each other, wherein both the steels (10, 12) 
can be held from rotating in one direction 

with respect to each other,
characterised in that
 : 

a releasable locking member (24) 
is provided which is free to move in its released state so as to 

permit it to abut both steels (10, 12) in order to 
lock them against rotation in both directions with respect 

to each other. 
An orthotic caliper according to claim 1, in which 
there is a gap between opposed end surfaces (20, 22) on the two 

steels (10, 12), and in which a wedge (24) acting as the releasable locking 
member is provided with surfaces (26, 28) adapted to abut 

corresponding surfaces (30, 32) on the steels. 
An orthotic caliper according to claim 2, in which 
frictional forces hold the wedge (24) in position while it is 

under load.  
 
An orthotic caliper according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
in which the surfaces (30, 32) of the steels (10, 12) on which 

the wedge (24) abuts are machined directly on to or into the 
steels so that a slot is formed into which the locking wedge fits 

tightly. 
An orthotic caliper according to claim 2 or any claim 
appendant thereto, in which the wedge (24) has a rod (34) which 

is provided at the end remote from the wedge with a plunger or 

piston (36) movable within a cylindrical chamber (38). 
An orthotic caliper according to claim 6, in which the 
plunger or piston (36) projects outwardly from the cylindrical 

chamber (38) so as to serve as a push-button in order to release 
the caliper from its locked position. 
An orthotic caliper according to any preceding claim, 
in which a spring (40) is provided to urge the 

releasable 
locking member 

(24) into a locking position.
