<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of hydrofluorocarbons, in particular hydrofluoroalkanes such as difluoromethane, which comprises contacting an  alpha -fluoro-ether, in particular a fluorinated dialkyl ether such as bis(fluoromethyl)ether in the liquid phase with a Lewis acid such as a fluoride of Nb, Sb, B, Ta, Al or Ti.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of hydrofluorocarbons and more 
particularly to a process for the production of 
hydrofluoroalkanes. In recent years chlorofluorocarbons, which are 
used on a large scale around the world, have been 
perceived as having an adverse effect on the ozone 
layer andlor as contributing to global warming. 
Chlorofluorocarbons are used, for example, as 
refrigerants, as foam blowing agents, as cleaning 
solvents and as propellants for aerosol sprays in 
which the variety of applications is virtually 
unlimited. Consequently, much effort is being devoted 
to finding suitable replacements for 
chlorofluorocarbons which will perform satisfactorily 
in the many applications in which chlorofluorocarbons 
are used but which will not have the aforementioned 
environmentally harmful effects. One approach in the 
search for suitable replacements has centred on 
fluorocarbons which do not contain chlorine but which 
may contain hydrogen, that is hydrofluorocarbons, of 
which many have been proposed as suitable 
replacements. Several methods for the preparation of 
hydrofluorocarbons are known but many of these 
methods involve the use of chlorine-containing 
starting materials and the production of 
chlorine-containing by-products. EP-A-0 518 506, relevant under Article 54(3) and (4) EPC, discloses 
a process for the production of difluoromethane by contacting 
bis(fluoromethyl) ether with aluminium fluoride in the gas phase. In 
WO 93/12057 there is described a chlorine-free process 
for the production of hydrofluorocarbons which 
comprises heating an α-fluoroether to elevated 
temperature in the vapour phase.  
 We have now found that α-fluoroethers may also 
be caused to decompose in the liquid phase to yield 
hydrofluorocarbons. According to the present invention there is 
provided a process for the production of a 
hydrofluorocarbon which comprises contacting an 
α-fluoro-ether in the liquid phase with a Lewis acid. The process of the present invention is 
especially useful in the production of 
hydrofluoroalkanes and according to a further aspect 
of the invention there is provided a process of 
producing a hydrofluoroalkane having the formula 
CnHxFy in which n is an integer from 1 to 6, y is an 
integer of at least 2 and x = 2n + 2 - y, which 
comprises contacting an α-fluoroether in the liquid 
phase with a Lewis acid. In the hydrofluoroalkane of formula CnHxFy, n is 
preferably an integer from 1 to 4 and y is preferably 
an integer from 2 to 9; more
