<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a twin hull marine or naval craft 
with reduced displacement, owing to the effect of aerodynamic lift of 
the part above the water surface. At present, naval crafts are well known of the SWATH type (Small 
Waterplane Area Twin Hull), consisting of a pair of completely immersed 
fusiform hulls supporting a spacious load platform above waterplane by 
means of elongated vertical structures. The reduced horizontal section of the above mentioned two load bearing 
structures reduces the wave resistance of the craft which has, in 
addition, high stability, since the horizontal load bearing structure is 
located, within determined limits, above the wave motion contour. If, on the one hand, a vehicle of such type allows even drastic 
reduction in wave resistance, the two immersed fusiform hulls must still 
produce a thrust equal to the weight of the whole structure, and for 
this reason it is not possible to reduce surface friction. Land and naval vehicles are also well known of the type called WIG (Wing 
in Gound effect Vehicle), which, by means of appropriately distributed 
load bearing contours, allow the weight of the vehicle to be partially 
or totally supported by aerodynamic effect, allowing higher transport 
speeds, for a same installed horsepower. The operational limit of this 
type of naval craft resides in the fact that the lift depends solely on 
the wing contours described, and this requires prohibitive dimensions or 
installed horsepower much higher than that installed in an ordinary land 
vehicle, and also involves problems of inadequate transverse stability, 
with the result that the increase in speed compensates only in part for  
 
the operational limits arising from greater dimensions and other 
limitations. GB-A 1 453 663 discloses a marine craft which is not basically a SWATH, 
but a "HYDROFOIL" vessel, as its vertical sides, which support the hull, 
are provided with a plurality of hydrofoils providing a hydrodynamic 
lift of the vessel. As it is clearly apparent from the drawings of this 
document, no immersed fusiform hulls typical of the SWATH are provided 
at the base of the vertical sides. The load platform of this vessel generates an aerodynamic lift which, 
however, is not decisive for the vessel lift, this being substantially 
due to the said hydrofoils. The aim of the present invention is to realize a naval craft which, 
while eliminating the limits of the two vehicles described above will 
allow full use to be made of its functional features.
