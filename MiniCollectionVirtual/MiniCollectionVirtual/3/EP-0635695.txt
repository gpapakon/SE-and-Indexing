<ABSTRACT>
A fighting vehicle, in particular an armoured howitzer, having a rotatable turret (T) which is arranged on the vehicle (F) in the region behind the vehicle centre and on which a heavy weapon (W) is arranged such that it can pivot in elevation. Located at the rear of the vehicle is a loading/unloading opening (B) which opens to the rear. The rounds (projectiles) are preferably stored in the rear part of the vehicle. Some of the rounds are arranged in the rear of the vehicle on both sides of the longitudinal centre plane, in one magazine (3, 4) for rounds, in each case, each of which magazines has a first part (3.1, 4.1), which is at right angles to the vehicle floor, and a second part (3.2, 4.2), which is arranged at the upper end of the first part and runs outwards parallel to the vehicle floor. Each magazine (3, 4) for rounds can be displaced from a loading position immediately in front of the loading/unloading (B) of the vehicle, transversely with respect to the longitudinal centre plane of the vehicle, into a storage position in which the second part (3.2, 4.2) of the magazine for rounds in each case engages over the track box (K1, K2) which runs on the longitudinal side of the vehicle interior. An additional magazine (5, 6) can in each case be arranged above the track box (K1, K2) of the vehicle, in the region in front of each magazine (3, 4) for rounds. Finally, a turret magazine for accommodating further rounds can be arranged in the rear of the turret, behind the weapon. Some of the propellent charges (cartridges) are arranged in propellent-charge containers (7, 8, 9) in the vehicle interior, and some in a propellent-charge container (2) in the turret.

<CLAIMS>
Combat vehicle, in particular an armoured howitzer having 
a rotatable turret, which is disposed on the vehicle in 

the region behind the centre of the vehicle and on which 
a heavy weapon is disposed so as to be slewable in 

elevation, and wherein at least some of the shells and 
propelling charges are stored inside the vehicle and a 

rearward-opening loading and unloading opening is 
disposed at the tail of the vehicle, characterized in 

that some of the shells (G3, G4) are disposed in the tail 
of the vehicle on either side of the longitudinal centre 

plane (M) in each case in a shell magazine (3, 4) which 
comprises a first part (3.1, 4.1) lying at right angles 

to the vehicle floor and a second part (3.2, 4.2) 
disposed at the top end of the first part and extending 

outwards parallel to the vehicle floor, shells being 
disposed with their shell nose directed forwards in the 

first and second parts and each shell magazine (3, 4) 
being displaceable out of a loading position directly in 

front of the loading and unloading opening (B) of the 
vehicle at right angles to the longitudinal centre plane 

(M) of the vehicle into a storage position, in which the 
second part (3.2, 4.2) of the shell magazine in each case 

overlaps the track case (K1, K2) extending along the 
longitudinal side of the vehicle interior. 
Combat vehicle according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the shell magazines (3, 4) in the tail of the 

vehicle are connected by telescopic guides to the vehicle 
and both in the loading position and in the storage 

position are held fast by means of arresting devices. 
Combat vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the longitudinal axis of the shell magazines (3, 

4) is offset outwards by a small acute angle (Î±) relative 
to the longitudinal centre plane (M) of the vehicle.  

 
Combat vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that disposed in the region in front of 

each shell magazine (3, 4) above the track case (K1, K2) 
of the vehicle is an additional magazine (5, 6) for 

receiving further shells, which are stored in a 
longitudinal direction with their shell nose directed 

forwards. 
Combat vehicle according to claim 4, characterized in 
that at least one container (9) for propelling charges is 

disposed in a longitudinal direction on at least one of 
the track cases (K2) of the vehicle in front of the 

additional magazine (6) for shells. 
Combat vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a further container (7) for 

propelling charges is additionally disposed in a 
transverse direction in the region next to the weapon 

(W).
