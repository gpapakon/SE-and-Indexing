<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for moving a vehicle in a direction 
perpendicular to the travelling direction by a slide 

mechanism attached to the vehicle chassis. Laterally 
movable mechanisms (8, 9) are disposed at front and rear 

portions of the vehicle chassis (1), and each movable 
mechanism (8, 9) comprises a pair of lifting means (12, 13) 

capable of lifting the chassis (1) upward, and a slide means 
(16, 17) is connected to the lower portion of the lifting 

means and is capable of moving laterally which contacting 
the ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a mechanism for 
moving a vehicle laterally, or sideways relative to its 
ordinary direction of travel. In the case of some types of vehicles for special 
purposes it is necessary that they can be transported at 
relatively high speed between job locations and then 
manoeuvred sideways, in confined spaces, to be closely 
adjacent the job. Such vehicles may include lifting 
platforms to allow access to high structures for maintenance 
and inspection. To manoeuvre conventional wheeled or 
tracked vehicles to be closely adjacent such a structure is 
difficult and time consuming. Accordingly, there is a 
desire to provide a vehicle capable of moving laterally to 
the normal travelling direction. A vehicle is known in which the wheels are capable 
of turning so that all the wheels can move at right angles 
relative to the normal travelling direction whereby the 
vehicle can move laterally. There is another known vehicle 
which can move laterally by virtue of a special push car 
which is accommodated in the lower portion of the vehicle. 
However, such vehicles are heavy and their structure 
complex, so they are not commonly used. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a mechanism for moving a vehicle laterally which alleviates 
at least one of the aforementioned problems and accordingly  
 
the present invention provides a mechanism for moving a 
vehicle laterally, capable of being mounted on the vehicle 
and having a lifting means capable of lifting the vehicle up 
so that the vehicle is supported by the mechanism, said 
mechanism having a part engageable with the ground and a 
part for engaging the vehicle, said parts being relatively 
slidably movable in the lateral direction when the vehicle is 
supported. One or preferably both of the parts may be an 
elongate and rigid member. By virtue of the mechanism it is possible to lift 
the vehicle by the lifting means so that the lower portion 
of the wheels or crawlers can be raised from the ground and 
thereafter the chassis can be slid laterally. As a result 
it is possible to move the chassis freely toward the wall of 
a house or building. When the chassis is not moved 
laterally, the lifting mechanisms lifts the entire chassis 
and the mechanism operates like an outrigger while 
contacting the ground, thereby stabilising the chassis. The mechanism according to the present invention 
enables the vehicle to move laterally relative to the normal 
travelling direction without changing the driving mechanism 
of the

<CLAIMS>
1. A mechanism (8,9) for moving a vehicle laterally, 
capable of being mounted on the vehicle and having a lifting 

means capable of lifting the vehicle up so that the vehicle 
is supported by the mechanism, said mechanism having a part 

engageable with the ground and a part for engaging the 
vehicle, said parts being relatively slidably movable in the 

lateral direction. 
2. A mechanism according to claim 1, wherein the 
lifting means is interposed between the vehicle and said 

parts. 
3. A mechanism according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein 
the lifting means comprises at least one hydraulic cylinder. 
4. A mechanism according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the ground engageable part is provided by an 

elongate tubular movable element (17) extending in the 
lateral direction and the vehicle engageable part is 

provided by an elongate fixed element (16) which is 
telescopically received into the movable element (17) so 

that the vehicle is moved laterally when the fixed element 
(16) is extended from the movable element (17) and the 

movable element (17) engages the ground. 
5. A mechanism according to claim 4 wherein a first 
hydraulic cylinder fixedly engages an end of the fixed 

element (16) and a second hydraulic cylinder of the lifting 
means is supported by rollers (25) movable in a channel 

shaped guide chassis (23) fixed to the upper surface of the 
movable element (17). 
6. A mechanism according to claim 4 or claim 5 wherein 
the fixed element (16) is extensible from the movable 

element by the action of a rod (20) extensible from an 
hydraulic cylinder (19) accommodated in the fixed element 

(16) and the movable element (17). 
7. A mechanism for moving a vehicle laterally 
characterised in that movable mechanisms (8, 9) are disposed 

one each adjacent the front and rear ends of the chassis (1) 
of the vehicle, each movable mechanism (8, 9) comprising a 

pair of lifting means (13, 14) capable of lifting the 
chassis (1) upward and a slide means (16, 17) connected to 

the lower portion of said lifting means and capable of 
moving laterally while contacting the ground. 
8. A mechanism of a vehicle according to claim 7, 
wherein each of said pair of lifting means includes a pair 

of leg covers (11, 12) which are fixed to the end of said 
chassis (1) and extend in an axial direction perpendicular 

to said chassis (1) and extensible legs (13, 14) which are 
 

housed in said pair of leg covers and are extensible 
downward from said leg covers (11, 12), said extensible legs 

(13, 14) being connected to said slide means (16, 17) at the 
other end thereof. 
9. A mechanism of a vehicle according to claim 7 or 
claim 8, characterised in that said slide means comprises a 

fixed slide member (16) disposed substantially horizontally 
relative to the lateral direction of said chassis (1) and a 

movable slide member (17) which is movable toward said fixed 
slide member (16) in the longitudinal direction thereof, 

whereby said fixed slide member (16) is slidable into said 
movable slide member (17), and said movable slide member 

(17) is capable of contacting the ground at the lower 
surface thereof. 
10 A laterally movable mechanism of a vehicle 
according to claim 9, wherein the lower end of one 

stretchable leg (13) is connected to one end of said fixed 
slide member (16) while the lower end of another stretchable 

leg (14) is connected to said movable slide member (17) so 
as to be relatively movable only in the longitudinal 

direction thereof.
