<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for forming thin film 
semiconductor devices using plasma enhanced CVD to form a 
thin film on a sample surface such as a semiconductor 
substrate, etc. In the past, the plasma enhanced CVD method, whereby a 
plasma is produced in a reaction vessel, and the reaction 
gas introduced into this reaction vessel is activated using 
plasma discharge energy, thereby promoting the deposition 
of a deposit formed by chemical vapor growth of the 
reaction gas on the sample surface, was widely used as a  
 
means of forming a thin film on a semiconductor substrate 
or other sample surface. In order to generate a plasma within the reaction vessel, 
methods used have included that in which a single frequency 
alternating current at 13.56 MHz, 400 kHz, etc., is applied 
between opposing electrodes erected within the reaction 
vessel, and said alternating current adjusted to control 
deposition speed and quality of the thin film formed, or 
the method whereby a 2.54 GHz microwave is guided to the 
reaction vessel through a waveguide. Gases used for the reaction gas included for the deposition 
of SiO₂ and SiON on the surface of a semiconductor 
substrate are, for example TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) 
gas and SiH₄ gas. In keeping with the demand in recent years for the 
realization of VLSI, the development of fine formation 
technology at submicron levels has taken on extreme 
importance. By experimentally verifying the shapes of thin 
films formed by conventional plasma-enhanced CVD methods, 
we have investigated the potential for submicronization 
using conventional techniques. Figures 6 (a) - (f) show the vertical sectional shape 
obtained when, in a conventional plasma-enhanced CVD 
(referred to below as PECVD), which generates a plasma in a 
reaction vessel by applying a 13.56 MHz single frequency 
power between the above opposing electrodes, the 
introduction of SiH₄ gas causes an insulating covering of 
SiO₂, to be formed on the SiO₂ oxide layer on the 
semiconductor substrate surface and Al wiring formed on 
that surface. For purposes of explanation, we shall refer  
 
to the bottom side of the SiO₂ thin film which is supposed 
to be formed for example, the above-mentioned SiO₂ film and 
Al wiring portion as the foundation. As is clear from these experimental results, the SiO₂ thin 
film has a sectional shape in which that side has ridges 
and roundness following the depressions and ridges of the 
foundation surface. In other words, as a result of the fact 
that the film
