<ABSTRACT>
In balances having a parallel-guided load pick-up (11), in which the weight force is transmitted to a measuring transducer (38) by means of a coupling (17), a twisting of the load pick-up (11) in a plane at right angles to the plane of the parallelogram guide takes place in the case of the introduction of a force off-centre. Furthermore, a transverse elastic design of the coupling (17) by means of a flexible region (36) is not sufficient for the suppression of the side load error, especially in high-resolution balances. According to the invention, for the extensive suppression of the side load error, the geometry of the balance is configured in such a way that the axis of the transverse twisting of the load pick-up (11) coincides with the localised transversely flexible region (36) of the coupling (17). Additionally, an error caused by a deformation of the parallelogram guide in the parallelogram plane is compensated by placing into the longitudinal axis of the coupling (17) the axis of the longitudinal rotation of the load pick-up (11) occurring in the case of this deformation.
