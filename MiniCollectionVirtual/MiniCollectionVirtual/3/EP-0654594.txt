<ABSTRACT>
The state of internal combustion engine 
inlet air dynamics is characterised in a substantially 

noise immune albeit rapid manner according to the 
degree by which a first set of criteria indicates a 

steady state condition in which engine inlet air rate 
substantially corresponds to cylinder inlet air rate 

or to the degree by which a second set of criteria 
indicates a transient condition in which engine inlet 

air rate does not substantially correspond to cylinder 
air rate. Cylinder inlet air rate may then be 

predicted in accordance with the characterisation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
detecting transitions between a steady state condition
and a transient condition in an internal combustion
engine and to a method of estimating the rate at which
air passes to cylinders of an internal combustion
engine.Internal combustion engine air/fuel ratio
control is known in which fuel command magnitude is
determined in response to an estimate of the magnitude
of an operator-controlled engine inlet air rate. Such
control may be termed "air-ead" control. If fuel is
controlled to individual cylinders, such as through
conventional port fuel injection, the corresponding
air rate of the cylinders must be estimated and the
fuel command determined in response thereto to provide
a desirable air/fuel ratio to the cylinders.A desirable engine air/fuel ratio may be the
well-known stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. Efficient
reduction of undesirable engine exhaust gas
constituents through conventional catalytic treatment
thereof occurs when the engine air/fuel ratio is the
stoichiometric ratio. Even minor deviations away from
the stoichiometric ratio can degrade emissions
reduction efficiency significantly. Thus, it is
important that the engine air/fuel ratio be closely
controlled to the stoichiometric ratio.The precision of the above-described air-ead
control is limited by the precision of the cylinder
inlet air rate sensing or estimation. When engine
inlet air dynamics are in a steady state, such that
the air pressure in the engine intake manifold is
substantially constant over a predetermined time 
period, precise cylinder inlet air rate sensing may be
provided through use of a conventional mass airflow
meter in the engine inlet air path. The absence of
any significant manifold filling or depletion in a
steady state provides for a direct correspondence
between manifold inlet air rate and cylinder inlet air
rate. Thus, the airflow meter may alone be used for
accurate cylinder inlet air rate estimation in steady
state.The airflow meter may not accurately
characterise cylinder inlet air rate under transient
conditions, such as conditions in which there is no
direct correspondence between manifold inlet air rate
and cylinder inlet air rate. This is primarily due to
the significant time constant associated with manifold
filling or depletion, and airflow meter lag.
Transient conditions can arise rapidly during engine
operation, such as by any substantial change in engine
inlet throttle position TPOS, or by any other
condition which disturbs manifold absolute pressure
MAP.
