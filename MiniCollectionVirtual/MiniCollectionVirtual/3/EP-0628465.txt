<ABSTRACT>
Piece of sports equipment, for example for use for winter sports, with at least two runners (13) which are connected to one another via at least one connecting device (1) and can be pivoted via runner joints (2) provided in each case between the runner (13) and connecting device (1). The axes of rotation of the runner joints (2) are inclined such that they slope in the direction of travel. The connecting device (1) has a control element (3) and a balancing element which can be pushed through the latter and connects the runner joints (2) such that shortening one portion of the balancing element, which portion protrudes out of the control element on one side, results in extension of that portion of the balancing element which protrudes on the other side of the control element, and vice versa.

Sport apparatus with at least two runners (13) which are linked by one
linking element (1) and which can be swung round over two runner

joints (2) respectively provided between the runner and the linking
element. The axis of rotation (50) of the runner joints (2) are inclined in

relation to the standing plane (18) of the runners (13), in which case the
standing plane (18) is meant as an ideal reference plane on which the

sport apparatus is standing with its runners (13) or their edges in a not
steered out neutral position of the runner joints (2). The axis of rotation

(50) are respectively situated in a plane that is mainly perpendicular to
the standing plane (18) of the runners (13) and mainly parallel to the

longitudinal direction of the sport apparatus.

This sport apparatus is characterised

by the fact that the inclination (α) of the axis of rotation (50) is
oriented in such manner that the axis of rotation (50) drop away in the

forwards direction of the sport apparatus, and

handlebars (3) and an equalising element (4, 5; 4, 6) that is pushed

through the handlebars (3) and links the runner joints (2) in such
manner that a shortening of one segment (4) of the equalising element,

that is outstanding on one side of the handlebars (3), leads to an
extension of the segment (4) of the equalising element, that is

outstanding on the other side of the handlebars (3), and vice-versa.
Sport apparatus according to claim 1 and characterised by the fact that

apparatus.
Sport apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 and characterised by the fact
