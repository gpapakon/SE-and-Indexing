<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of proteases for detergent purposes.
More specifically, the invention relates to the use of proteases derived from members
of the genus Arthrobacter for detergent purposes.Microorganisms belonging to the genus Arthrobacter are well known
in the literature and they are known to produce various enzymes, e.g.
endodextranases, aminopeptidases, glucoseisomerases, cephalosporin C amidase,
and adenylcobamide coenzyme, as well as other compounds, e.g. polysaccharides.
Various applications for these and other compounds have been described.Proteolytic enzymes from strains of Arthrobacter are also well known
and have been thoroughly studied, vide e.g. Hofsten et al. [Biochim. Biophys. Acta
110 (1965); 576-584; 585-598; and 599-607].In GB Patent Specification No. 1,029,978 it is proposed to use a
proteolytic enzyme from Arthrobacter in the foodstuff industry, in leather and textile
processing, and in basic scientific research.In EP Patent Application No. 245,560 it is proposed to use viable
microorganisms, e.g. bacterial cells from strains of Arthrobacter in abrasive surface
cleaners, in order to improve waste degradation and facilitate sewage treatment, due
to the microbial growth.Surprisingly, it has now been found that excellent washing properties
are conferred to detergent compositions when proteolytic enzymes obtainable from
strains of the genus Arthrobacter are incorporated into these compositions. The present invention relates to the use of proteolytic enzymes
obtainable from strains of the genus Arthrobacter for detergent purposes.Accordingly, the invention provides detergent compositions comprising
one or more proteases obtainable from, or one or more proteases having
immunochemical properties identical or partially identical to those of a protease
derived from any of the strains NCIMB No. 40294; NCIMB No. 40295; NCIMB No.
40296; NCIMB No. 40297; NCIMB No. 40298; NCIMB No. 40299; NCIMB 40300; and
ATCC No. 7562.In another aspect, the invention provides detergent compositions
comprising one or more proteases obtainable from a member of the genus
Arthrobacter, or a mutant or a variant thereof.In yet another aspect, the invention provides detergent additives
comprising a protease obtainable from, or a protease having immunochemical
properties identical or partially identical to those of a protease derived from any of
the strains NCIMB No. 40294; NCIMB No. 40295; NCIMB No. 40296; NCIMB No.
40297; NCIMB No. 40298; NCIMB No. 40299; NCIMB 40300; and ATCC No. 7562.In a further

simultaneously with one or more other enzymes from the group of amylases, lipases,

cellulases, oxidases, and peroxidases.
The use according to any of claims 1-4, wherein the protease is
provided in the form of a non-dusting granulate, a liquid, in particular a stabilized liquid,

a slurry, or a protected enzyme.
