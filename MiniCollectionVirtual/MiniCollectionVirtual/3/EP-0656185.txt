<ABSTRACT>
An improved plastic, clamp-style garment hanger is 
provided. The hanger (10) provides two clamps (16) disposed on an 

I-beam-like crossbar (14) on opposing sides of a hook (12). The lateral 
positions of the clamp (16) are adjustable. The spring-clip (48) that 

biases the garment engaging surfaces of the clamps (16) together 
also provides frictional engagement between the clamps and the upper 

ridge (22) of the crossbar (14). Hooks (60) disposed at either end of 
the crossbar (14) are suitable for engaging straps and also limit 

the outward lateral position of the clamps. Steps (30) or stacking 
ribs (28) disposed adjacent to the hook (12) limit the inward lateral 

movement of the clamps (16). The spring bias of the spring-clip (48) 
against the clamps resists clamp creep under the weight of a 

heavy garment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to garment hangers 
and more specifically to clamp-type garment hangers. The 
garment hanger of the present invention includes improved 
laterally adjustable clamps. Clamp-type garment hangers, that is garment hangers 
featuring a crossbar with two clamps disposed at opposing ends 
thereof, are well-known. Further, clamp-type garment hangers 
with clamps whose position along the crossbar is laterally 
adjustable are also known. However, the means for adjusting 
the lateral position of the clamps along the crossbar has been 
relatively ineffective and the present invention makes a 
significant contribution to that effect. The contribution made by the present invention can 
be best understood after consideration of the prior art. The 
first garment hangers equipped with laterally adjustable clamps 
included a wire or metal crossbar with two metal pinch clips 
disposed around the crossbar. To avoid the possibility of the 
clips creeping along the crossbar under the weight of the 
garment, the frictional engagement between the clips and the 
crossbar was significant, making it difficult for the consumer 
to adjust the position of the clips along the crossbar. 
However, if the portion of the clips that engage the crossbar 
became loose or worn, the clips moved too easily along the  
 
crossbar and the garment would not hang properly. 
Specifically, if a pair of pants is hung from the pant cuffs 
from a crossbar, it is highly desirable to stretch the cuff 
tight between the two clips. For the consumer, this position 
tends to avoid wrinkling of the pants during storage in the 
closet. For the retailer, this position is essential for an 
aesthetically appealing display of the garment in the retail 
setting. Plastic clamp-type garment hangers are also known. 
Further, garment hangers comprised of plastic crossbars and 
plastic clamps with laterally adjustable clamps are also known. 
However, the currently available laterally adjustable plastic 
clamps are not convenient to use or aesthetically appealing 
from a retail standpoint. Some plastic clamps engage the 
garment and crossbar so tightly that they cannot be moved once 
they assume the clamping position. Other plastic clamps are 
too loose and are disposed to creep as discussed above. Accordingly, there is a need for a plastic 
clamp-style garment hanger that is aesthetically appealing and 
therefore useful in the retail setting and further that 
includes laterally adjustable clamps that are convenient to use 
but are not
