<ABSTRACT>
A novel method for the production of titanium dioxide slurries having a 
high solids content comprises subjecting an aqueous slurry of titanium dioxide 

to cross-flow filtration to produce a slurry containing at least 50%, preferably 
60 to 80% titanium dioxide by weight. The slurry can be washed during 

filtration to reduce the concentration of soluble ions. The process can produce 
concentrated slurries of titanium dioxide having remarkabl
y low viscosities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation of titanium dioxide slurries and
in particular to the concentration of aqueous titanium dioxide suspensions to
produce slurries having a high solids content.The known processes for the production of titanium dioxide pigments
usually generate aqueous dispersions of titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is
frequently separated from these dispersions by, for example, pressure or
vacuum filtration to provide a filter cake which is then dried. For many
applications, this dried pigment is subsequently redispersed in water for use.
This separation and redispersing is clearly wasteful of energy and time. It is
advantageous to produce directly a dispersion or slurry of titanium dioxide
with a high solids content and such a slurry should desirably have a low
viscosity to facilitate handling.It is an object of the invention to provide a process for the production
of a useful high solids slurry of titanium dioxide.According to the invention, a process for the production of an aqueous
slurry of titanium dioxide with a high solids content comprises subjecting a
suspension of titanium dioxide particles in water having an initial solids content between
20 and 35 per cent by weight to the effects of cross-flow
filtration and continuing the cross-flow filtration process until the suspension
contains more than 50 per cent by weight titanium dioxide calculated as TiO2.The term "cross-flow filtration" is herein used to describe a filtration
process in which a suspension of solid particles is caused to flow across the
surface of a membrane whilst the suspension is subjected to a pressure which
tends to cause the fluid medium of the suspension to flow through the
membrane which is permeable to the medium but not to the suspended solids.
The flow of the suspension across the surface of the membrane minimises any
excessive build-up of solids on the surface of the membrane. Mechanical 
vibration of the surface of the membrane can also be used to enhance the effect
of the flowing medium.In the process of the invention the filtration is continued until the solids
content of the suspension is more than 50 per cent by weight titanium dioxide.
Particularly useful slurries contain from 60 to 80 per cent titanium dioxide by
weight and the most useful slurries contain from 70 to 80 per cent by weight.A major advantage of the process of the invention is that the slurries
produced have a relatively low viscosity despite their high solids content and
these slurries can be produced using a relatively
