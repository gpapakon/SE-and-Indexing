<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new derivatives of 1-imidazolylalkyl-3-phenyl-imidazolidin-2-ones,
to a
process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical
compositions containing them and to their use as
therapeutic agents.The present invention provides novel compounds having the
general formula (I)

wherein
n is 1;each of R, R1 and R2, which may be the same or different,
is hydrogen, halogen, cyano, C1-C6 alkyl, CF3, C1-C6
alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio or nitro;R3 is an imidazolyl group of formula

wherein 
each of R8 and R10 which may be the same or different is
hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl;R9 is hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl; and the pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof.The formula reported above for the compounds according to
the present invention includes all the possible isomers,
as well as their mixtures.The invention includes within its scope the metabolites
and the metabolic precursors or bio-precursors (otherwise
known as pro-drugs) of the compounds of formula (I).
Namely, the invention includes compounds which have a
different formula to formula (I) above, but which
nevertheless upon administration to a human being are
converted directly or indirectly in vivo into a compound
of formula (I).A halogen atom may be a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or
iodine atom, preferably it is chlorine or bromine.
The alkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio group may be a branched
or straight chain group.A C1-C6 alkyl group is preferably a C1-C4 alkyl group,
e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec. butyl
or tert. butyl, in particular methyl or ethyl.A C1-C6 alkoxy group is preferably a C1-C4 alkoxy group,
e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy and butoxy,
preferably methoxy and ethoxy. A C1-C6 alkylthio group is preferably a C1-C4 alkylthio
group, e.g. methylthio, ethylthio, propylthio and
butylthio, in particular methylthio.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of
formula (I) include acid addition salts, with inorganic,
e.g. nitric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric,
perchloric and phosphoric acids, or organic, e.g. acetic,
propionic, glycolic, lactic, oxalic, malonic, fumaric,
malic, maleic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, cinnamic,
mandelic and salicylic acids.Preferred compounds of the invention are the compounds of
formula (I) wherein
each of R, R1 and R2, which may be the same or different,
is hydrogen, halogen, cyano, CF3, C1-C4 alkylthio or C1-C4
alkoxy;n is 1;R3 is as defined above;each of R8, R9 and R10 is independently hydrogen or C1-C4
alkyl; and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Examples
