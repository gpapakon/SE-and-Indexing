<ABSTRACT>
A method of electrically connecting a tape automated bonding lead (28) to an aluminum input/outpout pad (10) of an integrated circuit includes sequentially sputtering an adhesive layer (16), a diffusion barrier layer (18) and a gold layer (20) on the input/output pad (10). The adhesive layer (16) is a metallic film having good step coverage and adhesive properties to contact the pad (10). The diffusion barrier layer (18) is formed atop the adhesive layer (16) and is sandwiched by the gold layer (20). The method employs "bumpless" techniques and the bond lead (28) is connected to the gold layer (20) by applying a combination of pressure and vibrational energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionBumpless Bonding Process Having Multilayer MetallizationTechnical FieldThe present invention relates generally to electrically connecting a bond lead to an input/output pad of an integrated circuit and relates more particular¬ ly to bumpless attachment of a tape automated bonding frame to an integrated circuit chip.Background Art The conventional method of attaching bond leads of a tape automated bonding frame to contact pads of an integrated circuit die requires forming conductive bumps on the contact pads. The contact pads are typically aluminum. Gold is electroplated at the contact pads to a height of approximately 25 μm. Lead ends of the bond¬ ing frame are then brought into contact with the electro¬ plated gold bumps and the temperature is elevated to electrically and mechanically bond the lead ends to the gold bumps. U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,662 to Jacobi identifies a number of difficulties with this conventional process. One identified difficulty is the complexity of fabricat¬ ing gold bumps. Furthermore, there are certain spatial and mechanical drawbacks resulting from the fact that the gold bumps often have a rounded top contour. The contour causes mating problems. For example, when a flat lead end is forced onto a rounded top contour, the lead end may slide somewhat, potentially causing contact between adjacent leads. Jacobi describes an alternative method of attaching bonding frame leads to the aluminum input/out¬ put pads of an integrated circuit chip. The lead ends are brought into direct contact with the aluminum 

input/output pads. The lead ends are ultrasonically vibrated to cause a bonding of the materials. Typically, the frame leads are copper members having a coating of gold. The ultrasonic vibration bonds the three materi- als. This operation is also described in U.S. Pat. No.4,917,286 to Pollacek, and is referred to as a "bumpless" tape automated bonding (TAB) method. Jacobi and Pollacek teach that because the method allows direct connection between the lead ends and the aluminum input/output pads, the manufacturing cost is reduced and manufacturing yield is improved.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method which further improves the interconnec¬ tion of a lead frame to input/output pads of an integrat- ed circuit chip.Summary of the InventionThe above object has been met by a method which is able to achieve the advantages of both the convention- al gold bump process and the bumpless bonding method. The present method utilizes ultrasonic bonding and is
