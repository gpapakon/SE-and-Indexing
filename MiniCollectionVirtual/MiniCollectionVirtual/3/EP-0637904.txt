<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electromagnetic radiation
shielding methods and apparatus, see for example DATABASE WPI, Section EI, Week 7816, Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB, Class SO2, AN 78-D2-D2104A & SU-A-552515.Electronic devices are often required to be shielded from
electromagnetic (EM) fields. The metal mass used in shielding
apparatus causes induced EM fields which can distort information
bearing EM signals. One kind of instrument that uses EM fields is
a helmet placement and orientation detector, where a sensor on a
helmet is used to sense EM fields from a radiator, which
determines position and orientation based on EM fields. When such
fields are distorted, errors in the determination result.Examples of such systems are described in U.S. Patent
4,054,881, in U.S. Patent 4,287,809, and in U.S. Patent
4,314,251. The described systems measure the orientation of an
aircraft pilots' helmet. Variations in the sensed fields allow
the location and orientation of the sensor relative to the
radiator can be calculated.The described helmet orientation systems can also be coupled
with a helmet mounted display, as described in U.S. Patent
3,923,370 and in U.S. Patent 4,761,056. The display image source,
for example, a 1/2 inch diameter cathode ray tube (CRT) is
shielded from EM radiation to prevent disturbance of the CRT by 
external EM fields, as well as to prevent disturbance of other
systems in the aircraft by EM fields which are generated by the
CRT coils. Since the CRT is relatively close to the position and
orientation determining sensors, distortion of external EM fields
caused by the shielding can result in errors in the determined
orientation and position.European Patent Application EP 0 058 412 A3 to Egli et. al.
describes a method of compensating for the distorted field by
iteratively calculating the distortions of the EM field vectors.
This calculation pre-determines a matrix of constants which
describe the relations between the undisturbed and the disturbed
fields. However, due to the limited signal to noise ratio, this
method has limited accuracy.A better way of solving the problem of distortion caused by
the shielding would be to avoid the distortion at its origin.
Generally, either a permeable material such as mu-metal or a
conductive metal is used for shielding. Mu-metal is generally
preferred metal because it will shield even when there are no EM
field fluctuations. However, shields made of a highly permeable
material such as mu-metal will cause external EM fields to be
highly

<CLAIMS>
A shield for electromagnetic radiation comprising:

a first layer (130) having a high magnetic
permeability; and
a second layer (132) having a high electrical
conductivity,
said second layer having a plurality of "U" shaped
slots (140) formed therein;
said shield being generally cylindrical in shape,
said first layer comprises an inner portion, and said

second layer comprises an outer portion of said generally
cylindrical shape, each of said "U" shaped slots

comprises a lengthwise slit (139) and two circumferential
slits (138) in said second layer, said circumferential

slits are generally perpendicular to said lengthwise
slit, and said two circumferential slits are separted

from a near by lengthwise slit of an adjacent "U" shaped
slot by a solid conducting material surface.
A shield according to claim 1, wherein said
lengthwise slit (139) has a length of approximately 34

percent of said given length of said generally
cylindrical shield (142).
A shield according to claim 1 or 2 and comprising a
plurality of said "U"-shaped slots (140,141) uniformly

distributed at the central part of the circumferential
surface of the generally cylindrical shape. 
A shield according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the
width of the lengthwise slit (139) is equal to

approximately 2.9 percent of the cylinder length.
A shield according to claim 4, wherein the
accumulated width of the lengthwise slits (139) is equal

to approximately 2.9 percent of the cylinder length.
A shield according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said solid conducting material surface

(132) separating said two circumferential slits (138)
from a nearby lengthwise slit (139) is substantially

smaller than the length of each said circumferential
slit.
A shield according to any of said preceding claims,
wherein at least one of the dimensions of said "U"-shaped

slots (140) and thicknesses of said layers (130,
132) are selected to reduce the electromagnetic field
