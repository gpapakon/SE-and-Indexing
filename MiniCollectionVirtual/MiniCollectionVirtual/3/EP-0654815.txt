<ABSTRACT>
Support element for an automatic loading table (10) of an exposure unit for silicon wafers, which has a circular section, with a first external diameter which is matched to the guide mechanism of a loading station and is smaller than that of a silicon wafer, the circular section (16) of the support element (11) having, at the circumference, parallel to the introduction direction of the loading station at least partially enlarged sections (17) and, with the latter, having a second external diameter which approximately corresponds to that of the silicon wafer (12), and the largest width of the support element (11), orthogonally to the insertion direction, corresponds to that of the circularly rounded section (16).

<CLAIMS>
A support element of an automatic load platform of a silicon wafer
exposure unit, which element has a circular cross-section with a first outer diameter

which is adapted to the guide of a load station and which is smaller than that of a
silicon wafer,

characterized in that the circular disc (16) of the support element (11) has at its
circumference parallel to the insertion direction of the load station at least partly

enlarged portions (17) and therewith a second outer diameter which corresponds
approximately to that of the silicon wafer (12), and in that the greatest width of the

support element (11) at right angles to the insertion direction corresponds to that of the
circular disc (16).
A support element as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the portions
(17) which enlarge the circular disc (16) are sectors of a circular ring.
A support element as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the portions
(17) in the form of sectors of a circular ring are subdivided at least once in

circumferential direction.
A support element as claimed in any one or several of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the support surface of the support element (11), comprising

the circular disc (16) and the portions (17) in the shape of sectors of a circular ring,
forms an exchangeable accessory of a load platform (10).
