<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel use of 2-[[2-(N-isobutyl-N-methyl)amino]benzylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
for 
the manufacture of an antimicrobial 
agent which is effective to inactivate Helicobacter pylori 
(which is formerly named Campylobacter pylori) and therefore 
is effective to treat or prevent infections caused by 
Helicobacter pylori. US-A-5 013 743 (corresponding to 
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 3-173817) 
discloses that pyridine derivatives having a specific 
formula such as 2-(2-pyridyl)methylsulfinylbenzimidazole 
are effective to inactivate Campylobacter pylori. ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY, Mar. 1991, 
p.490-496 describes that lansoprazole and omeprazole have 
antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori. Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 3-161440 
(published on July 11, 1991) discloses that condensed 
imidazole derivatives having a benzopyran, benzothiopyran, 
tetrahydroquinoline, or indoline ring are effective to 
inactivate Campylobacter pylori. US-A-5 093 342 discloses that 5-methoxy-2[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole 
is effective for treating 
infectious diseases caused by Campylobacter pylori. WO89/03219 (published on April 20, 1989, which corresponds 
to US-A-5 196 205) discloses 
that a bismuth compound is effective to treat infections 
caused by Campylobacter pylori.  
 Further, a number of studies concerning relationship 
between Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer or gastritis 
have been reported. For instance, "Advance of Medical 
Science (in Japanese)", Vol. 159, No. 10, 1991, pp. 795 is 
mentioned. There is a report suggesting a relationship 
between Helicobacter pylori and recurrence of duodenal 
ulcer. GB-A-21 63 747 discloses 
a condensed imidazole derivative which is effective as an 
anti-ulcer agent, but is silent with respect to antimicrobacterial 
activity against to Helicobacter pylori. Japan. J. Pharmacol., 55, 1991, 477-491, discloses the 
gastroprotective activity of 2-[[2-(N-isobutyl-N-methyl)amino]benzylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
in the treatment of peptic 
ulcer. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
antimicrobial agent against Helicobacter pylori. The invention provides a use of 2-[[2-(N-isobutyl-N-methyl)amino]benzylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
for the manufacture 
of a medicament for treating or preventing infections 
caused by Helicobacter pylori. This compound is used by administering 
to a patient suffering the infections in an 
amount sufficient for the treatment
