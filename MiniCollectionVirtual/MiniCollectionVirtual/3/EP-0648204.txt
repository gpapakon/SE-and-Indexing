<ABSTRACT>
The invention is charaterized by using in cosmetic compositions one or more amino deoxyalditol lipophilic derivatives of general formula (I) wherein R
<
1
>
 is a saturated straight aliphatic C14-C40 radical; R
<
2
>
 is a hydrogen atom or a straight C1-C6 alkyl radical; X is an oxygen atom or a methylene radical; and n is an integer from 1 to 5; provided that when X is a methylene radical, R' includes from 19 to 39 carbon atoms. Application in the preparation of cosmetic compositions for the treatment of keratin substances and bucco-dental hygiene.
