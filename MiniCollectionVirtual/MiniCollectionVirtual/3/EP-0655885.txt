<ABSTRACT>
A BGA carrier for storing and shipping of BGA 
packages in a side-by-side arrangement adapted for dispensing 

of the same in a one-by-one fashion under gravity 
includes a flat elongated tubular body member (22), a 

lower end plug member (24), and an upper end plug member 
(26). The tubular body member has a first end and a 

second end. The tubular body member has a bore of a 
rectangular cross-section extending therethrough between 

the first end and the second end. The tubular body 
member includes a flat top wall portion (29), a flat 

bottom wall portion (30), and a pair of vertically 
extending side walls (32, 34) all formed integrally 

together. Opposed overhanging slot means (36) are formed 
in the pair of vertically extending side walls for 

supporting only two side edges of a plurality of BGA 
packages (12) so that top and bottom surfaces thereof are 

suspended freely between the top and bottom wall portions 
of the tubular body member. As a result, shock and potential 

physical damage to the BGA packages have been 
reduced during commercial handling and shipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a BGA carrier of a
unique construction for storing and shipping of ball grid
array (BGA) packages in a side-by-side arrangement and
adapted for dispensing of the same in a one-by-one
fashion under gravity.In recent years, the miniaturization of integrated
circuit chips has progressed significantly, and small-sized,
rectangular plate-shaped parts of the type having
no leads, such as pin grid array packages, have been
coming into extensive use. Some of these types of pin
grid array package structures are formed with solder
balls on their bottom surface rather than with external
terminal pins and are referred to as "ball grid arrays"
(3GA) packages. BGA packages of this type have extraordinarily
small outer dimensions. For example, a BGA
package having 165 solder balls on its bottom surface may
have dimensions of about 23.0 mm (in length) X 23.0 mm
(in width) X 2.13 mm (in thickness). It is therefore
quite difficult to store and/or transport a large number
of these BGA packages in a predetermined arrangement.
Moreover, it is extremely time-consuming to manually
mount such BGA packages one-by-one onto a printed circuit 
board as is done in the case of conventional larger
circuit components.As a result, there has arisen a need for chip
carriers or containers for housing and/or shipping these
BGA packages so as to facilitate their storage and
transportation from an integrated circuit chip manufacturer's
site to an assembly station at a customer's
site where automatic equipment functions to remove the
BGA packages from the chip carrier and to mount the BGA
packages onto a printed circuit board (PCB) or the like.
Further, the chip carrier may also function so as to
bring different types of electrical components to the
assembly station in proper order for sequential assembly
operations.In order to function properly, the chip carriers
must be capable of transporting the components placed
therein and then, at the proper location (i.e.,
customer's site) be capable of being quickly and positively
opened so that the components can be easily removed
for assembly purposes. In addition, the chip
carrier must also be able to provide a degree of protection
for the sensitive components to be transported
therein with respect to contamination, electrostatic
discharge (ESD), temperature changes and mechanical
shock. To date, the prior art solutions to these problems has involved the use of chip
carrier trays having a plurality of separate compartments or pockets for holding the
individual BGA

A ball grid array carrier for storing and shipping of ball grid array packages in a side-by-side
arrangement and adapted for dispensing of the same in a one-by-one fashion under

gravity, said ball grid array carrier comprising:

a flat, elongated tubular body member (22) having a first end and a second end;
said tubular member having a bore of a substantially rectangular cross-section
extending therethrough between said first end and said second end;
said tubular body member including a flat top wall portion (29), a flat bottom
wall portion (30), and a pair of vertically extending side walls (32, 34) all formed

integrally together;
a plurality of ball grid array packages (12) disposed in the bore of said tubular body
member to substantially fill the same, each of said ball grid array packages being of a substantially

rectangular shape and having side edges, a top surface, and a bottom surface;
opposed slot means (36) formed in said pair of vertically extending side walls and
being arranged in the area intermediate said top and bottom wall portions; and
said opposed slot means supporting only two of said side edges of said plurality
of ball grid array packages so that the top and bottom surfaces thereof are suspended freely

between said top and bottom wall portions of said tubular member.
A ball grid array carrier as claimed in claim 1, wherein said slot means includes interior
surfaces (40) which engage the respective side edges of the plurality of ball grid array packages

and guides the same to the bore in a precise alignment so as to prevent a shingling effect.

said first end of said elongated tubular body member (22) is a dispensing end and
said second end of said elongated tubular body member (22) is a loading end;
said ball grid array carrier further comprising:
first plug means (24) disposed slidably and frictionally into the bore adjacent said
dispensing end of said tubular member, and 
second plug means (26) disposed slidably and frictionally into the bore adjacent
said second end of said tubular member.
A ball grid array carrier as claimed in claim 3, wherein said tubular body member is

means are formed of an elastomeric material.
A ball grid array carrier as claimed in claim 3, wherein each of said first and second plug
means has a substantially T-shaped cross-section and includes a horizontal platform

portion (42) and a narrow vertical portion (44) joined integrally to said platform portion.
A ball grid array carrier as claimed in claim 7, wherein said vertical portions of said plug
means are provided with fin-like projections (46) which elastically engages the inner

surfaces of the bore of said tubular member.
A ball grid array carrier as claimed in claim 3, wherein each of said opposed slot means
includes an interior surface (40) which engages the respective side edges of the plurality

plug means has a distal end (51) which engages one of the remaining side edges of the

lowermost ball grid array package. 
A ball grid array carrier as claimed in claim 10, wherein said vertical portion of said
second plug means has a distal portion (52) which engages one of the remaining side

edges of the uppermost ball grid array package.
