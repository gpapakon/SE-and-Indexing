<ABSTRACT>
A treated labdanum oil having an acid value of not 
more than 10, a process for preparing the same, and a perfume 

composition containing the same are disclosed. The treated 
labdanum oil is prepared by contacting a labdanum raw 

material with an amount corresponding to 0.5 to 10 times 
equivalents, based on the acid equivalent 

of the labdanum raw oil, of an alkaline substance. A 
treated labdanum oil with a clear amber-like fragrance and 

substantially no color can be obtained simply and at low 
cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a treated labdanum oil with
an improved odor which is useful as a material of a perfume
composition, a process for producing the same, and a perfume
composition containing the same.Labdanum raw material is a black and highly viscous
liquid obtained from plants belonging to the genus Cistus and
is used in various perfume compositions. Labdanum raw
material most in use includes labdanum gum obtained by
collecting a resin separated from Cistusladaniferus by
boiling it in water, labdanum extract obtained by removing
inorganic solids from the above-mentioned labdanum gum with
an organic solvent, and labdanum gum distillate obtained by
distillation or fractional distillation of the above-mentioned
labdanum extract.However, these conventional labdanum products not
only give off an undesired wood-like crude odor like
cedarwood oil as well as an amber-like fragrance but assume a
black to brown black color. Therefore, when applied as a
material of perfume compositions for soaps, detergents, etc.,
they deteriorate the odor and color of the scented products.
It has thus been demanded to develop a treated labdanum oil
having an improved odor while retaining the amber-like odor 
inherent to labdanum and is useful as a material of perfume
compositions.As a result of extensive study, the present inventors
have found that the offensive odor emitted from labdanum gum,
etc. comes from acids, such as carboxylic acids and phenols,
and that these acids can be removed by contact with an
alkaline substance. The present invention has been completed
based on this finding.Namely, the present invention provides a treated
labdanum oil having an acid value of not more than 10.The present invention also provides a process for
producing a treated labdanum oil having an acid value of not
more than 10, which comprises contacting at least one
labdanum raw material selected from:
(a) labdanum gum obtainable by collecting a resin
separated from Cistusladaniferus by boiling it in
water,(b) labdanum extract obtainable by extracting the
labdanum gum with an organic solvent to remove
inorganic solids, and(c) labdanum gum distillate obtainable by
distillation or fractional distillation of the
labdanum gum extract,
with an alkaline substance in an amount of 0.5 to 10
equivalents, based on the acid equivalent of the labdanum 
raw material, and then recovering the treated
labdanum oil.The present invention further provides a perfume
composition containing a treated labdanum oil having an acid
value of not more than 10.The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A treated labdanum oil having an acid value of
not more than 10.
A process for producing a treated labdanum oil
having an acid value of not more than 10 comprising a step of

contacting at least one labdanum raw material selected from:

(a) labdanum gum obtainable by collecting a resin
separated from 
Cistus
ladaniferus
 by boiling it in
water,
(b) labdanum extract obtainable by extracting said
labdanum gum with an organic solvent to remove

inorganic solids, and
(c) labdanum gum distillate obtainable by
distillation or fractional distillation of said

labdanum gum extract,

with an alkaline substance in an amount of 0.5 to 10
equivalents, based on the acid equivalent of said labdanum

raw material.
The process of claim 2, wherein said alkaline
substance is selected form alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline

earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, and a
mixture of them.
The process of claim 3, wherein said alkaline
substance is sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. 
The process of any of claims 2, 3 and 4, wherein
said labdanum raw material is contacted with said alkaline

substance by adding an aqueous solution of said alkaline
substance to said labdanum raw material, and then mixing with

stirring the mixture.
The process of claim 2, wherein said labdanum raw
material is contacted with said alkaline substance in the

presence of an organic solvent.
The process of claim 6, wherein said organic
solvent is selected from hexane, heptane, cyclohexane,

benzene, toluene, xylene and a mixture of them.
