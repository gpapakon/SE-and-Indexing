<ABSTRACT>
Modulating mirrors comprising variable-sized cells (CD1-CDn) for locally changing the flatness of a reflecting surface (18) are described. In particular, a process for controlling said cells (CD1-CDn), which change size according to a voltage, is described. The cells (CD1-CDn) are each arranged between first and second electrodes (17, 26) between which a control voltage (Vc) is applied. A photoconductive element (P1-Pn) is inserted between the second electrode (26) and the cell (CD1-CDn), and a light beam (MF1-MFn) illuminates the photoconductive element (P1-Pn) when said cell is to be lengthened ( DELTA 1).
