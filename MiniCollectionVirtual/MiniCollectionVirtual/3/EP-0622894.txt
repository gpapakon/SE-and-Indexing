<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to semiconductor power amplifier
integrated circuits and, more particularly, is directed to a semiconductor power
amplifier integrated circuit suitable for use in a portable telephone terminal.Recently, in the land mobile communication such as a mobile telephone,
a portable telephone or the like, present frequency band allocated to the land
mobile communication becomes insufficient for radio communication due to the
increase of subscribers. Then, various new services for the land mobile
communication have been successively decided to be started. These new services
are common in that they are performed by using digital communication employing
a quasi-microwave band of 0.8 to 2 GHz.At present, the development has been delayed as to microwave integrated
circuits such as a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (hereinafter referred to
as a MMIC) capable of being used in this frequency band. Terminal devices for
such a land mobile communication are indispensably required to be miniaturized
since portability is mainly made much account of the terminal devices. Then,
integration of electric parts used in the terminal device has become a most important
problem.As an example of the related art, there has conventionally been suggested
such a semiconductor power amplifier integrated circuit as mentioned in "Low-Power-Voltage
Operated Power Amplification Module", National Conference of
the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers of Japan,
Spring 1993, Paper C-83.This semiconductor power amplifier integrated circuit uses metal-semiconductor
field effect transistors (hereinafter referred to simply as MES FETs)
and is integrated in the form of a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)
up to a drive stage, but a last stage is provided from the outside as an external part.As another example of the related art, there is such a semiconductor
power amplifier integrated circuit as disclosed in "Cellular Telecommunication
GaAs Power Module", the Applied Micro-wave, Fall, 1992, pp. 83-88.Such a semiconductor power amplifier integrated circuit also uses MES
FETs and input and output impedance matching circuits thereof are constituted by
a distributed constant circuit. Further, a circuit impedance connected to each of the MES FETs is set in
a stable region of each of the MES FETs, respectively.Since the aforesaid conventional semiconductor power amplifier
integrated circuits employ the MES FETs each requiring a negative voltage as its
gate voltage, these
