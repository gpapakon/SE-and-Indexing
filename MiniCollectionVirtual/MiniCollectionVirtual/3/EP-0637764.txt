<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in growing epitaxially on a substrate (8) of 
<
100
>
 orientation a stop layer (18), a confinement layer (20), an active layer (22) and another confinement layer (24); in etching these layers in order to form a pattern and a guide strip (stripe) oriented along a first crystalline direction; in forming a mask (34) withstanding a chemical etching of the substrate, including, on each side of the pattern, two openings (36, 38) communicating in a second direction parallel to a cleavage plane; in subjecting the structure to the said etching in order to etch away the substrate and to form a beam oriented in the first direction and having one end fixed; and in subjecting the beam to a jet of pressurized fluid in order to cleave it in the region of its fixed end.
