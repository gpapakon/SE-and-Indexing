<ABSTRACT>
Hybrid engines containing a metal-ceramic interface 
can be lubricated with composition comprising a carrier 

fluid and a molybdenum thiocarbamate. Friction and wear 
are low even when detergent and dispersant additives are 

present in the lubricant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for lubricating
a ceramic-metal interface, such as may be found in
an internal combustion engine.The increased use of ceramic components in passenger
cars, such as ceramic valve train components, requires a
lubricant which can be used in hybrid ceramic engines.
However, high wear losses of metals in contact with ceramics
in the presence of conventional lubricants containing
zinc dithiophosphate extreme pressure agents are a concern.
It has been reported in Lub. Eng., 45, 1989, p. 761, F.
Rounds, that interaction among surface-active additives
(detergents and dispersants) in lubricants has a negative
effect on the anti-wear performance of zinc dithiophosphate
at a low load region in the anti-wear regime. The present
invention, therefore, provides an improved method for
lubricating such ceramic-metal interfaces.Tribology Transactions, 34 (1991) 417-425 (Preprint
No. 90-TC-2C-1, October 8-10, 1990), Gates and Hsu, "Effect
of Selected Chemical Compounds on the Lubrication of
Silicon Nitride," discloses lubrication of ceramic surfaces
with a variety of compounds including organo molybdenum
dithiocarbamate and sulfur-molybdenum compounds. Molybdenum-sulfur
compounds are reported to only act as friction
reducers for silicon nitride unless they also contain
phosphorus. When phosphorus is also present, low wear can
be obtained in addition to low friction.Tribology Transactions 32 (1989) 2, 251-257, Yamamoto
and Gondo, "Friction and Wear Characteristics of Molybdenum
Dithiocarbamate and Molybdenum Dithiophosphate," discloses
the use of molybdenum dithiocarbamate in a hydrocarbon
baseline oil for reducing friction between surfaces of high
carbon chromium bearing steel.U.S. Patent 4,832,867, Seiki et al., May 23, 1989,
discloses a lubricating oil composition which comprises 
lubricating base oil, at least one organophosphorus compound,
and at least one organomolybdenum compound selected
from the group consisting of molybdenum oxysulfide alkylphosphorodithioates
and molybdenum oxysulfide alkyldithiocarbamates.
The lubricating composition is reportedly
excellent in antiwear properties, anti-seizure properties,
and corrosion resistance, and is suitable for gear oils,
bearing oils, internal combustion engine oils, automatic
transmission fluids, hydraulic fluid, and metal working
fluids.U.S. Patent 4,846,983, Ward, Jr., July 11, 1989,
discloses molybdenum or tungsten thiocarbamate additives
for functional fluids, e.g., lubricating oils, automatic
transmission fluids, and fuel
