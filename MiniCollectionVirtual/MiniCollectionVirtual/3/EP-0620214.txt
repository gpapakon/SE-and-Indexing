<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 1H-indole-3-acetic
acid hydrazides useful for inhibiting sPLA2 mediated
release of arachidonic acid for conditions such as septic
shock.The structure and physical properties of human non-pancreatic
secretory phospholipase A2 (hereinafter
called, "sPLA2") has been thoroughly described in two
articles, namely, "Cloning and Recombinant Expression of
Fhospholipase A2 Present in Rheumatoid Arthritic Synovial
Fluid" by Seilhamer, Jeffrey J.; Pruzanski, Waldemar;
Vadas Peter; Plant, Shelley; Miller, Judy A.; Kloss,
Jean; and Johnson, Lorin K.; The Journal of Biological
Chemistry, Vol. 264, No. 10, Issue of April 5, pp. 5335-5338,
1989; and "Structure and Properties of a Human Non-pancreatic
Phospholipase A2" by Kramer, Ruth M.; Hession,
Catherine; Johansen, Berit; Hayes, Gretchen; McGray, 
Paula; Chow, E. Pingchang; Tizard, Richard; and Pepinsky,
R. Blake; The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 264,
No. 10, Issue of April 5, pp. 5768-5775, 1990.It is believed that sPLA2 is a rate limiting enzyme
in the arachidonic acid cascade which hydrolyzes membrane
phospholipids. Thus, it is important to develop
compounds which inhibit sPLA2 mediated release of fatty
acids (e.g., arachidonic acid). Such compounds would be
of value in general treatment of conditions induced
and/or maintained by overproduction of SPLA2; such as
septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome,
pancreatitis, trauma, bronchial asthma, allergic
rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and etc.Indolyl-3 substituted compounds having glyoxylamide
functionality are described in U.S. Patent 2,825,734.
This patent related to a process for converting
glyoxyamides to 3-(2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl )indoles.U.S. Patent No. 3,271,416 describes indolyl
aliphatic acids as sun screening agents and
intermediates. These acids may be -NH2 substituted (see,
definition of M in claim 1) and require 5- or 6- psition
substitution with nitrogen or sulfur functional groups.U.S. Patent No. 2,890,223 and the article "The
Synthesis of Tryptamines Related to Serotaonin", by
Elliott Shaw, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 77, 1955, (pp.
4319-4324 describe several amide derivatives of 3-indoleacetic
acids. These compounds are used in the
preparation of 5-lower alkoxy tryptamines and are stated
to have utility for influencing serotonin related
functions in the brain.Selected indole type compounds have been described
in the literature for the treatment of arthritic
disorders. Thus, U.S. Patents No. 3,196,162; 3,242,162; 
3,242,163; and 3,242,193 (see, Col. 3,
