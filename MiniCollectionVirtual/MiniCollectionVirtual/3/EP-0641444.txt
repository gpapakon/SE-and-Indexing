<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns an optical voltage/electric field sensor that comprises crystal (3) the distribution of refractive index of which depends on electric field, wires (7) for leading the electric field onto the surface of the crystal (3), polarizers (1, 4) aligned on both sides of crystal (3), and phase shift plate (2) to detect changes in the distribution of the refractive index, and optical fibres (20) for routing light through the construction formed by polarizers (1, 4) and the crystal (3). In accordance with the invention the inner cavity surrounding crystal (3) of the sensor is filled with a transparent material (5) that has low extinction coefficient and dielectric constant, like silicone. The construction in accordance with the invention is highly applicable for measuring the voltage of high frequency dryers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical sensor for voltage and
electric field based on the Pockels effect in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1.The function of the present voltage and electric field sensor is
based on the electro-optical Pockels effect that is exhibited
e.g. by the following materials: LiNbO3, LiTaO3, KDP, ADP, and
Bi4Ge3O12. According to the Pockels effect the plane of
polarization of polarized light alters when the light is passed
through such a material in the presence of an electric field.
The Pockels effect is exhibited typically by crystalline
materials that do not possess a centre of symmetry.Distribution of refractive index of the crystal used as the
optical sensor is altered by the voltage being measured. The
resultant difference in refractive index depends on the intensity
of electric field. The difference in refractive index produces
a phase difference between the mutually perpendicularly polarized
components of the plane polarized light passed through the
material. Depending on structure and orientation of the crystal,
a longitudinal or a transverse effect occurs. In the
longitudinal effect the path of the ray and the electric field
are parallel, and in the transverse effect they are perpendicular
to each other.A measurement system based on the Pockels effect comprises
typically an optical sensor, optical fibres, and an electronic
unit that transmits infrared radiation modulated by the voltage
of electric field being measured, through the fibres to the 
sensor. Information about voltage or electric field is obtained
by means of measuring the intensity changes of the radiation
returned by the sensor.A voltage sensor having, in sequence, a polarizer, a waveplate,
a crystal of Bi12SiO20 and an analyser is disclosed in IEEE
Transactions on Power Delivery, vol. PWRD-2, No. 1 (January
1987), pages 87-93. An electric field sensor having a thin protective coating
of silicone is disclosed in GB 2212907A.Optical voltage sensors based on the Pockels effect are developed
for various high voltage measurements. Most of the embodiments
are designed to function in the 50-60 Hz frequency range. A few
demonstrations have been carried out to measure also rapid
changes in voltage. Problems of the high frequency embodiments
have been the high frequency high voltage endurance and the
frequency range of the measurement system. For example, in the
high frequency drying 13.56 MHz 
frequency and 10 kV voltage are used.The aim of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the prior
