<ABSTRACT>
Amino acid-based composition intended for oral, enteral or parenteral administration, which contains, in a biologically and nutritionally acceptable medium, at least cysteine, free or in the form of a precursor, prodrug, protein or peptide hydrolysate, in a proportion of pharmacologically active cysteine greater than the proportion of cysteine present in a nutritional composition corresponding to the requirements of a healthy man, the proportion of cysteine being determined relative to the total quantity of amino acids present in the composition.
