<ABSTRACT>
A solid oxide electrolyte fuel cell comprises a power 
generation film consisting of a solid oxide electrolyte film (22) 

dimpled (22a,22b) on almost whole area on both sides thereof, 
an oxygen 

electrode (24) formed on one side thereof, and a fuel electrode (23) 
formed on the other side of thereof, and comprises a pair of 

interconnectors (25a,25b,25c) located on both sides of the power 
generation 

film. Furthermore, this invention adopts a seal structure (26) 
(26a) for 

sealing each side of the power generation film and each of the 
corresponding interconnector to achieve the above-described 

object. The peripheral area on the power generation film 
to form a seal face with the interconnector is formed to have 

an almost the same plane with that of the dimpled pattern 
formed on the power generation film, and the provided seal 

section has almost the same thermal expansion coefficient with 
the solid oxide electrolyte film which forms the power 

generation film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid oxide electrolyte fuel
cell (hereinafter referred to simply as "SOFC"), and more
particularly to an SOFC which is applicable to an electrolytic
cell in water electrolysis and CO2 electrolysis, as well as to
power generation.A typical example of a conventional plate type SOFC is
shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of
disassembly of the conventional plate type SOFC, and Fig. 4
shows a perspective view of the assembly thereof. In the
figures, the reference numeral 1 denotes a power generation
film consisting of a solid oxide electrolyte film 2, an oxygen
electrode 3, which is provided on the upper surface of the
solid oxide electrolyte film 2, and a fuel electrode (not
shown), which is provided on the under surface of the solid
oxide electrolyte film 2.An interconnector 6 is provided on the upper surface of
the power generation film 1 through a corrugated air electrode
side support 4 and packings 5,5, divided into two pieces to
hold the air electrode side support 4 from both sides. When 
laminated, the air electrode side support 4 is held between the
packings 5,5.Further, the reference numeral 7 denotes an air inlet
provided at the side gap of the packings 5,5. An air outlet
(not shown) is provided at the other side gap of the packings
5,5, opposed to the air inlet 7.Furthermore, on the under surface of the power generation
film 1, there is provided an interconnector 10 through a fuel
electrode side support 8 having a corrugated shape in
perpendicular direction against the air electrode side support
4, and packings 9,9, divided into two pieces to hold the fuel
electrode side support 8 from both sides. Accordingly, when
laminated, the fuel electrode side support 8 is held between
the packings 9,9. The reference numerals 11 and 12 denote a
fuel inlet and a fuel outlet, respectively, provided at the
both side gaps between the packings 9,9.The flow of fuel is in a perpendicular direction to that of
air, that is, the fuel is introduced from the inlet 11 and
flows into the fuel outlet 12 through the both surfaces of the
fuel electrode side support 8, and air is introduced from the
air inlet 7 and flows into the air outlet(not shown) through
the both surfaces of the air electrode side support 4.Thus formed cell is generally laminated to several layers
to increase an output. That is, to increase the output, air
electrode side components such as packings 5,5 and an air 
electrode side support 4 are mounted on the under surface of
the interconnector 10, and an
