<ABSTRACT>
Analyser having a device for separating magnetic microparticles from a suspension, the separation device containing two permanent magnets (41, 61) and (42, 62), between which the reaction vessel (8) containing a suspension is located. For faster and more complete separation of the magnetic microparticles (27), the magnets (41, 61) and (42, 62) are located diametrically opposite with respect to the reaction vessel (8) and the pole axes (47) of the magnets (41, 61) and (42, 62) form an acute angle ( alpha ) with the longitudinal axis (48) of the reaction vessel (8).
