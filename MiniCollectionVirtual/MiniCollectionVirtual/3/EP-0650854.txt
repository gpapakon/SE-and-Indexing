composed of two wheels (12) which are rotatably mounted at 

the opposite ends of a spindle (6) that is driven through a 
seat of a support (1) which is composed of a vertical wall 

(2) that lies between the wheels (12) and in which a 
cylindrical recess (8) is formed with a vertical axis that

parallel to said spindle (6), the lever element comprising 
an arm (30) for blocking said wheels (12), which lies 

between the wheels, and an actuation arm (29), which can be

provided for retaining the lever element (28) in the two 
positions, the blocking arm (30) being suitable to block the 

rotation of the wheels (12) in one of the two positions and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a braking device for a
self-orientating twin castor.The so-called twin castors that are mounted on pieces
of furniture (tables, chairs, chests of drawers, and so
forth) are generally constituted by two wheels provided with
axial bushes for rotatably mounting them on a supporting
spindle. The spindle is driven through a support which is
constituted by a vertical wall that lies between the wheels
and by a sort of semicylindrical hood that covers the wheels
in an upward region.A cylindrical recess is formed in the wall and has a
vertical axis that is eccentric with respect to the spindle
and is open upwardly. Said recess acts as a rotation seat
for a self-orientation pivot to be inserted and fixed in an
appropriate seat of the piece of furniture on which the
castor is to be mounted.Safety rules very often require castors to be self-braking.
For this purpose, said castors are provided with
devices that keep the wheels in a constantly braked
condition until the user deactivates these devices
temporarily. These castors have some hardly negligible
drawbacks. First of all, in order to provide the support for
self-braking castors it is necessary to provide molds that
are different from those of castors that do not have a self-braking
device. Secondly, the assembly of self-braking
castors is relatively complicated and considerably affects
the manufacturing cost.US-A-4 911 269 discloses a twin wheel caster with an
integral brake assembly. 
In particular, the integral brake
assembly includes a resilient braking arm which is
integrally hingedly connected at its inner end to the
central body of the caster. This integral hinge connection
does not permit that the braking arm may be used in an
optional manner.US-A-4 333 207 discloses a twin wheel caster brake
including a brake lever that extends through a slot of a
wheel cover and that is pivotally mounted intermediate its
ends between a pair of lugs by a pivot pin. GB-A-2 151 470
discloses a caster with a brake mechanism movably disposed
in the caster support, in which the brake mechanism is
movably inserted in an upper rabbet and pivotally linked to
a tortuous portion of the caster support by a lever pin
through aligned pin holes. Both US-A-4 333 207 and GB-A-2
151 470 disclose conventional expensive pivotal connections,
without teachings relating to optional brake use, and with
visibly compromising apertures through which the brakes
extend.GB-A-2 166 046 discloses a twin-wheel castor with a
brake lever having an intermediate portion

Braking device for a self-orientating twin castor
comprising two wheels (12) which are rotatably mounted at

the opposite ends of a spindle (6) that is driven through a
seat of a support (1) which is composed of a vertical wall

(2) that lies between said wheels (12) and in which a
cylindrical recess (8) is formed with a vertical axis that

is eccentric with respect to said spindle, said recess (8)
being open in an upward region for the engagement of a pivot

for mounting the castor in a piece of furniture, the castor
further comprising a semicylindrical hood (3) which covers

said wheels, and the braking device further comprising a
lever element (28) with means for selectively coupling the

lever element at one end of said hood so the lever element
can oscillate between two positions about an axis that is

parallel to said spindle (6), said lever element comprising
an arm (30) for blocking said wheels (12), which lies

between said wheels, and an actuation arm (29), which can be
accessed by a user, retention means being furthermore

provided for retaining said lever element (28) in said
positions, said blocking arm (30) being suitable to block

the rotation of said wheels (12) in one of said positions
and to allow their rotation in the other one of said

positions, wherein when said lever element (28) is coupled
at said hood (3) by said selective coupling means said

actuation arm (29) of said lever element extends outwardly
from below a lower edge of said semicylindrical hood (3) and

said blocking arm (30) of said lever element extends from
said lower edge underneath said semicylindrical hood (3),

and wherein said selective coupling means are in the form of 
an elastic snap-together coupling (27,33,37) disposed

underneath said semicylindrical hood for selectively
pivotally connecting said lever element (28) at said hood
