<ABSTRACT>
A slurry comprising aggregates of different particle size 
and a bituminous emulsion is suitable for use in road surfacing, 

and by variation of the ratio of the different aggregates can 
achieve a wide variety of sustainable texture depths, including 

texture depths greater than 1.5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of asphalt in road 
surfacing, and in particular to the use of microasphalt. The advent of polymer-modified bitumen emulsion systems did 
much to establish and expand the use of the cold-applied 
microasphalt road-surfacing technique. Today the use of 
microasphalt, in particular the "Ralumac" system, is well-established 
throughout the world as an effective maintenance 
system, with a very wide application tolerance and significant 
customer and road surface benefits. The U.K. Department of Transport requires that any surfacing 
products used on roads subject to vehicle speeds in excess of 
60 mph (c. 100 km/h) should have a sustainable texture depth of 
greater than 1.5 mm. Currently, microasphalt systems by their 
very nature and the way they are applied do not achieve this 
requirement. Therefore, the current advantages of the 
microasphalt systems are denied to a substantial part of the UK 
road network. It would therefore be desirable to provide microasphalt in a 
form that is capable of achieving a sustainable texture depth of 
greater than 1.5 mm. According to the present invention, a slurry comprises 
bituminous emulsion and relatively coarse and relatively fine 
aggregates that are present in relative amounts such that gaps 
exist between the particles of the aggregates. The slurry can be used to surface a road, and by varying the 
relative amounts of the coarse and fine fractions in the slurry, 
a wide variety of sustainable texture depths can be achieved, 
including texture depths greater than 1.5 mm. Therefore the 
slurry of the invention has the advantage of wider applicability 
than previously known microasphalts. In the following the terms "coarse" and "fine" are used to 
describe the relative sizes of the two kinds of aggregate 
included in the slurry of the invention. The coarse aggregate  
 
has a substantially uniform particle size typically of 6 mm to 
20 mm, preferably 6 mm to 14 mm, and more preferably 6 mm to 
10 mm. The coarse aggregates typically comprise stone, such as 
limestone, basalt and granite, and mixtures thereof. The fine aggregate has a substantially uniform particle size 
typically of up to 3 mm, and preferably up to 2 mm. More 
preferably it additionally comprises material having a particle 
size that is greater than this and is typically up to 10 mm, and 
preferably up to 6 mm, which contributes to a greater mechanical 
strength in the resulting road surfacing. The coarse aggregate 
always has a greater particle size than

<CLAIMS>
A slurry comprising bituminous emulsion and relatively 
coarse and relatively fine aggregates that are present in 

relative amounts such that gaps exist between the particles of 
the aggregates. 
A slurry according to claim 1, wherein the gaps comprise 3 
to 25% by volume of the gaps existing in the absence of fine 

aggregate. 
A slurry according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the ratio 
of coarse : fine aggregate is 1:10 to 10:1 by volume, preferably at 

least 1:1. 
A slurry according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
coarse aggregate has a substantially uniform particle size of 6 

to 20 mm, and the fine aggregate comprises material having a 
substantially uniform particle size of up to 3 mm. 
A slurry according to claim 4, wherein the fine aggregate 
further comprises material having a substantially uniform 

particle size of greater than 3 mm and up to 10 mm. 
A slurry according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
coarse and fine aggregates each have a substantially uniform 

particle size and the coarse aggregate is greater in particle 
size than the fine aggregate by at least 4 mm. 
A slurry according to any preceding claim, further 
comprising up to 10% by weight of a filler wherein 90% by weight 

of the filler has a particle size of less than 100 Âµm and is 
smaller than the fine aggregate which has a substantially uniform 

particle size. 
A slurry according to any preceding claim, further 
comprising a thickening agent, which preferably comprises fibrous 

material in an amount of up to 5% by weight of the total weight 
of the slurry, such fibrous material preferably comprising fibres 

having a length of up to 60 mm. 
A slurry according to any preceding claim, further 
comprising a breaking agent. 
A road surfacing obtainable by curing a slurry according to 
any preceding claim, the surfacing preferably having a 

sustainable texture depth of greater than 1.5 mm. 
A method of road surfacing comprising applying to a road a 
slurry according to any one of claims 1 to 9 and allowing the 

slurry to cure, with the optional step of applying to the road a 
breaking agent prior to applying the slurry thereto, and with 

optional further step of applying a tack coat to the road prior 
to applying the slurry or breaking agent, if present, thereto.
