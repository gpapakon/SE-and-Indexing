<ABSTRACT>
Adjustable components for swimming pool cleaners or other devices are disclosed. The components, when forming part of a fluid-interruption cleaner, can accommodate a variety of diaphragms (26) (valves) of different lengths. The exterior of the cleaner's inner tube (18), to which the diaphragm (26) is attached, includes a series of spaced, concentric ribs (82), any selected group of which may be gripped by a cantilever ring (30) positioned betweeen the inner tube (18) and the cleaner body (14). Because the inner tube (18) may be alternatively positioned relative to the cantilever ring (30) and body (14), it can accept and accommodate diaphragms (26) of varying length. The components also facilitate removal of the diaphragm (26) and inner tube (18) from the cleaner for inspection or, for example, when repair or replacement is desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to components of
swimming pool cleaners and more particularly to an
adjustable tube and ancillary constituents of an
automatic, fluid-interruption version of such
cleaners.A variety of devices exist that move
automatically over surfaces of swimming pools to be
cleaned. One such pool cleaner operates in
cooperation with the reduced pressure caused by a
pump to induce debris-laden fluid within a pool to
flow through the cleaner (and other filtration
equipment if desired). The cleaner functions by
causing a valve, or diaphragm, to oscillate,
periodically interrupting the fluid flow through
the cleaner. This periodic interruption in turn
causes movement of the device over the surface to
be cleaned. Suitable valves or diaphragms for such
a fluid-interruption cleaner are described in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,642,833 and 4,742,593, which patents
are incorporated herein in their entireties by this
reference.U.S. Patent No. 5,014,382,
discloses one such fluid-interruption version of an
automatic swimming pool cleaner
according to the preamble of claim 1.
As described in
the patent, the cleaner preferably includes a
tubular resilient diaphragm to interrupt the flow
of fluid (such as water) through the cleaner during
use. The diaphragm entrance is typically located
adjacent the inlet foot of the cleaner, while its
exit communicates with an inner tube circumscribed
by the cleaner's rigid extension pipe (outer tube).
Because the cleaner's exterior body (together with
the inlet foot and inner tube) fix the diaphragm in
position, the diaphragm is not easily removed from 
the cleaner for repair or replacement. Moreover,
the rigid structures can accommodate only a single
size diaphragm. As a result, not only must
diaphragm manufacturing tolerances be minimized,
but substitution of diaphragms of different lengths
is precluded as well.The invention aims to an assembly for permitting fluid
flow comprising:
a. a body defining an inlet, an outlet, and a passage
between the inlet and the outlet for fluid to flow
therethrough; b. means, comprising a valve removably positioned within
the passage, for periodically interrupting the flow of
fluid through the passage; c. a first tube attached to the valve;
said assembly being characterized in that it comprises: d. means, received by the outlet and comprising a ring
having a canted surface engaging and circumscribing a
portion of the first tube, for resisting but not precluding
movement of the tube relative to the body. The present invention includes adjustable

<CLAIMS>
An assembly for permitting fluid flow comprising :

a. a body (14) defining an inlet (38), an outlet (50), and a
passage between the inlet (38) and the outlet (50) for

fluid to flow therethrough ;
b. means, comprising a valve (26) removably positioned
within the passage, for periodically interrupting the

flow of fluid through the passage ;
c. a first tube (18) attached to the valve (26) ;

said assembly being characterized in that it comprises:
d. means, received by the outlet (50) and comprising a
ring (28) having a canted surface (92) engaging and

circumscribing a portion of the first tube (18), for
resisting but not precluding movement of the tube (18)

relative to the body.
An assembly according to claim 1 further comprising :

a. a second tube (22) adapted to circumscribe at least a
portion of the first tube (18) ; and
b. means (58) for removably attaching the second tube
(22) to the body (14).
An assembly according to claim 2 in which the outlet of
the body is a threaded outlet (50), further comprising a

threaded collar (62) connected to the second tube (22) and
adapted to engage said threaded outlet (50).
An assembly according to claim 2 or 3 in which the first
tube (18) has an exterior surface comprising a plurality of

annular ribs (82). 
An assembly according to claim 4 in which the ring (28) is
a compressible ring (28) having an exterior and adapted to

engage the body (14) and when compressed to engage at
least one of the annular ribs (82).
An assembly according to claim 5 in which the second tube
(22) defines a longitudinal axis (70) and at least a portion

of the exterior of the compressible ring (28) is canted
approximately 10-20Â° off the longitudinal axis.
An assembly according to claim 6 in which the threaded
collar (62) is connected to the second tube (22) and adapted

to engage the threaded outlet (50) of the body (14), for
removably attaching the second tube (22) to the body (14)

while permitting the second tube (22) to rotate about the
longitudinal axis (70).
An assembly according to claim 1 in which the valve
comprises a diaphragm (26) which has a lug (46) integrally

formed therewith.
An assembly according to claim 8 in which a diaphragm
(26) has an inlet adapted to abut the inlet (38) of the body

(14), and an outlet (86).
An assembly according to claims 6 and 9 taken together,
further comprising a resilient ring (94), intermediate the

compressible ring (28) and the diaphragm (26) and
contacting both when the compressible ring (28) is

compressed, for biasing the diaphragm (26). 
An assembly according to claim 10 in which the resilient
ring (94) biases the diaphragm (26) so as to decrease the

effective length of the diaphragm (26) by approximately
0.5-1.5 mm.
An assembly according to claim 3 in which the threaded
collar (62) connected to the second tube (22), defines a

plurality of apertures (72) for removably attaching the
second tube (22) to the body (14) while permitting the

second tube (22) to rotate about the longitudinal axis (70)
and allowing any selected entrapped debris to exit the

assembly.
