<CLAIMS>
A screw (1) for securing a medullary space pin, 
comprising a screw head (2) and a screw shank (3) provided 

with an external thread (4), the screw shank thread (4) in 
the vicinity of the screw head (2) being provided over only 

part of the length of the screw shank (3) and the screw head 
(2) being constructed as a hexagon socket screw head or a 

cross-recess screw head, characterized in that the screw head 
(2) comprises an external thread (5) on its outside, the 

thread direction of which runs counter to the thread 
direction of the screw shank thread (4). 
A screw according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the screw head thread (5) begins at a distance from the free 

end of the screw head (2) and the outer diameter of the screw 
head (2) here corresponds to approximately the core diameter 

of the screw head thread (5). 
A screw according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized 
in that between the screw shank thread (4) and the underside 

of the screw head (2) there is provided a thread-free area 
(6). 
A screw according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the thread depth of the screw shank 

thread (4) diminishes towards the thread-less screw shank 
(3).
