<ABSTRACT>
In an electronically controlled braking system 
which incorporates anti-lock brake control and 

comprises a plurality of brake pressure control valves 
(20a; 20b; 20c; 20d) having associated local 

electronic control units (16a; 16b; 16c; 16d) which 
communicate with a master electronic control unit 

(10), part of the anti-lock brake control logic for a 
wheel is performed by the electronic control unit 

(16a; 16b; 16c; 16d) associated with the pressure 
control valve for that wheel, with the remainder of 

the anti-lock brake control logic for that wheel being 
performed by the master electronic control unit (10). 

The local valve-associated electronic control unit 
(16) includes skid detection logic (46) which causes 

the brake pressure at the associated wheel to be 
reduced in response to a wheel skid detected thereby, 

brake pressure at that wheel being controlled 
thereafter, at least for a defined period, according 

to demands (Pa) communicated to the local control unit 
(16) from the master control unit (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with
electronic braking control systems for motor vehicles.Some modern proposed electronic braking control
systems have a number of brake pressure control valves
distributed around a vehicle, with a single
controlling computer responsible for determining the
appropriate brake pressure for each wheel or group of
wheels on the vehicle.A brake pressure control valve may consist of a
number of solenoids, and possibly brake pressure and
other transducers. This entails a large number of
connections to the valve. The length and complexity
of the wiring to the valve can be reduced by providing
a small computer close to, or physically within the
valve. This local computer can receive instructions
from the master controller via a communications link,
and control the operation of the solenoids within the
valve to produce the brake pressure changes demanded
by the master controller. The local controller can
also process signals from the transducers associated
with each valve, and pass this data back along the
communications link to be master controller.If these braking control systems are to perform 
anti-lock braking functions, then wheel speed sensors
are necessary at some or all of the vehicle wheels.
In some systems, these sensors are connected directly
to the master controller. However, where there is a
computer in the local brake pressure control valve,
the signals from the wheel speed sensors are in some
cases taken to this local controller rather than the
master. This local computer converts the stream of
pulses from the, for example variable reluctance
transducer into a digital signal which is passed to
the master controller along the communications link.
This reduces the length of the wiring from the sensor,
and also the processing load on the master controller.An example of a known braking system for a four
wheel vehicle consists of four brake pressure control
valves, one at each wheel, with the wheel speed sensor
at each wheel providing a signal to its local brake
pressure control valve. Each valve contains a small
local computer based controller which converts the
pulses from the wheel speed sensors into digital
values and passes these along a communications link to
a central master controller. This master controller
is connected to a transducer at the brake pedal which
indicates the driver's brake demand. The master
controller uses the driver's brake demand to calculate
an appropriate brake pressure for each wheel, and 
instructs each valve to produce this pressure

An electronically controlled braking system
incorporating anti-lock brake control and comprising a

plurality of brake pressure control valves (20a; 20b;
20c; 20d) with associated electronic control units

(16a; 16b; 16c; 16d) which communicate with one or
more master electronic control units (10), and wherein

part of the anti-lock brake control logic for a wheel
is performed by the electronic control unit (16a;

16b; 16c; 16d) associated with the pressure control
valve for that wheel, with the remainder of the anti-lock

brake control logic for that wheel being
performed by said one or more master electronic

control units (10) which are in communication with the
valve-associated electronic control units (16a; 16b;

16c; 16d), characterised in that the valve-associated
electronic unit (16) includes skid detection logic

(46) which causes brake pressure at the associated
wheel to be reduced temporarily in response to a wheel

skid condition detected thereby, brake pressure at
that wheel being controlled thereafter according to

demands (Pa) communicated to the control unit (16)
from the master control unit (10).
An electronically controlled braking system
as claimed in claim 1, in which signals from a

respective wheel speed transducer (26a;26b;26c;26d) 
are provided to the electronic control unit

(16a;16b;16c;16d) associated with the brake pressure
control valve (20a;20b;20c;20d) which controls the

brake pressure at the wheel fitted with the wheel
speed transducer (26a;26b;26c;26d).
An electronically controlled braking system
as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the valve-associated

electronic control unit (16) is arranged to
override the pressure demand signals from the master

controller for a time period which is related to the
delays inherent in the system architecture such that

the valve (20) will return to controlling brake
pressure in response to demands from the master

control unit (10) when the pressure demand (Pa)
received from the master controller (10) has been

modified by the ABS logic (40) in the master
controller (10) in response to said wheel skid.
An electronically controlled braking system
as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the skid detection

logic (46) in the valve-associated electronic control
unit (16) is responsive to a detected change in wheel

behaviour which indicates that the reduction in brake
pressure may have been effective in controlling the

wheel skid, to halt the reduction in brake pressure. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, in which the
master electronic control unit (10) receives wheel

speed measurements made by the valve-associated
electronic control units (16a; 16b; 16c; 16d) and

combines these to establish an estimate of vehicle
speed.
A system as claimed in claim 5, in which the
master electronic control unit (10) uses a measurement

of vehicle acceleration, derived from an accelerometer
mounted on the vehicle, in its estimation of vehicle

speed.
A system as claimed in claim 5 or 6, in which
said estimate of vehicle speed is transmitted to a

valve-associated electronic control unit (16a; 16b;
16c; 16d) for use in taking local control decisions at

the latter unit.
A system as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7,
in which a valve-associated electronic control unit

(16a; 16b; 16c; 16d) sends a specific signal (Pd) to
the master electronic control unit (10) when the

latter valve-associated electronic unit (16a; 16b;
16c; 16d) takes a decision to set a brake pressure to

a level determined by anti-lock brake control logic in
that unit (16) rather than to a level demanded by said

master electronic control unit (10).
A system as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
in which the master electronic control unit (10) sends

a specific signal (I) to a valve-associated electronic
control unit (16) which forces said valve-associated

electronic control unit (16) to set the brake pressure
in response to the brake pressure demand (Pa) sent

from said master electronic control unit (10),
irrespective of any wheel behaviour.
An electronically controlled braking system as
claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, in which there is

one master electronic control unit (10) for the whole
vehicle, and one brake pressure control valve (20) for

each wheel on the vehicle.
An electronically controlled braking system
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, in which said one

or more master electronic control units (10) are
associated with and directly control one or more brake

pressure control valves (20) as well as communicating
with other valve-associated electronic control units

(16) on the vehicle.
A system as claimed in any of claims 1 to
9, in which a brake pressure control valve (20)

controls the brake pressure at two or more wheels.
A system as claimed in any of claims 1 to

(20) share a common valve-associated electronic unit
(16). 
A system as claimed in claim 1, in which the
anti-lock brake logic is divided between said one or

more master electronic control units (10) and the
valve-associated control units (16) such that all of

the valve-associated control units (16) contain part
of the ABS control logic for every wheel that they

control.
