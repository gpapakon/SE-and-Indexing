<ABSTRACT>
A rectangular frame (1) forms the base for the folding roof. A fixed cylinder (4) is located centrally on one transverse side of the frame. Starting from there are a plurality of roof supports (10) (roof arches) which bear a tarpaulin (12). Folded together, all the roof supports (10) are disposed adjacently in parallel in the region of the frame (1), the tarpaulin (12) hanging down between them. With the aid of two pivoting arms (23), one half of the roof supports is adjusted in each case in the manner of a fan towards the one side or towards the other side, the tarpaulin becoming taut so that in total a full circle is covered. In the region of the cylinder, the roof supports are connected by jointed strips (20) which are placed around the cylinder when the roof supports have been spread. The folding roof can be installed in a stationary manner or can be mounted on a vehicle, for example a beverage truck.

Folding roof in which an awning is held by several roof 
poles (10; 33; 43, 53) forming groups, the roof pole (10', 

33') of one group being fixedly mounted to a vertical 
cylinder (4, 32) or a partial cylinder (50, 53) and the 

other roof poles being articulated to each other and to 
the fixed roof pole in such a manner that the group of 

roof poles can be positioned in a fan-shaped manner in 
a spread position in which the awning is stretched and 

in a position parallel to each other in which the awning 
is folded, characterised by the following features: 


the roof poles (10; 33; 43; 53) are in each case frame-work 
constructions with a vertical strut (10c; 43c), 

a horizontal flange (10b; 43b) and a flange (10a; 43a) 
with gentle slope carrying the awning (12, 45); 
to each strut there are fixedly welded an upper plate 
(20a) and a lower plate which in the spread position 

is supported at the cylinder (4; 32) or partial cylinder 
(50; 53); 
the plates are connected to each other by hinges (20b). 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
a pivot arm (23) is associated with each group of roof 

poles, which emerges in the region of the cylinder from 
a shaft (21) comprising a drive and is at its free end 

connected to the outmost poles of the group by means 
of a hinge (23a). 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the flanges (10a) of the poles receiving the awning (12) 

are inclined towards the cylinder.  
 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the flanges (43a) of the poles receiving the awning (45) 

are inclined outwardly. 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 1, characterised by two 
groups of roof poles (10) which lie in the region of a 

rectangular outline when pivoted together and which extend 
in each case over a semicircle when they are spread. 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 1, characterised by four 
groups of roof poles (43), two of which extend in each 

case over the half of an elongated rectangular outline when 
pivoted together and complement each other to form a 

full circle by being spread over 90°. 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that 
guide pipes (48) are arranged radially between two roof 

poles sloping outwardly which fold the awning by lifting 
when pivoting together the roof poles by means of spring 

mechanisms (49). 
Folding roof as claimed in claim 1, characterised by a 
support (50) which is semicircular in a top view and 

has two groups of roof poles (51) which each are spreadable 
by 90°.
