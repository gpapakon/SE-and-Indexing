<ABSTRACT>
The projection wall comprises a screen part (1) which bears the screen material (3) and rests on two carriers (2, 2'). The screen part (1) can be tilted in both directions of rotation with respect to the carriers (2, 2'), about the tilting axis (4), by means of a hydraulic drive (14). The carriers (2, 2') can be collapsed about a carrier axis (8) by means of hydraulically driven retaining elements (7). By virtue of the ability to tilt the screen part (1) to both sides, it is possible to avoid wind forces from the front and from the rear at any time. Moreover, the entire apparatus can be folded downwards, until it is virtually flat on the ground, into a mounting position. The projection wall is simple to mount and does not require anchorage.

<CLAIMS>
Projection wall, in particular for open
air presentations, which comprises a substantially rigid,

tiltable screen section (1), for receiving a picture to
be projected, and at least one support (2, 2'), wherein

the screen section (1) can be titled in respect to the
support about a horizontal tilting axis (4) into both directions

(15, 15') from a substantially vertical operation
position, and wherein the support caries the screen

section (1) in the tilting axis (4), characterized in
that each support (2, 2') comprises an upper support section

(6) and a foot section (5), wherein the upper support
section (6) is connected in the tilting axis (4) to

the screen section (1) and can be tilted about a support
axis (8) in respect to the foot section (5), wherein the

support axis lies parallel to the titling axis (4).
Projection wall of claim 1, characterized
in that the screen section (1) can be titled in both directions

at least into a horizontal position.
Projection wall of one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the screen section (81)

comprises a screen surface (3) held by a support construction
(10 - 13), wherein the support construction (10

- 13) comprises a substantially torsion-proof axis girder
(10) along the tilting axis.
Projection wall of one of the preceding
claims characterized in that it comprises at least one

titling drive (14) acting directly on the tilting axis
(4).
Projection wall of one of the preceding
claims characterized in that it comprises two lateral

supports (2, 2').
Projection wall of one of the preceding
claims characterized in that the foot section (5) of each

support (2, 2') is arranged substantially horizontally
and transversely to the support axis (8), and that a 

length-adjustable support element (7) is arranged between
the foot section (5) and the upper support section (6)

for tilting the upper support section (6).
Projection wall of the claims 4 and 6,
characterized in that hydraulics (14,17,18,21,22) are

provided for driving the tilting drive (14) and/or the
support element (7), wherein the hydraulics are designed

such that upon reaching of a maximum wind pressure onto
the screen section an excess-pressure valve can be released

and the screen section (1) can thereby be lowered.
Projection wall of claim 7, characterized
in that at least one breaking element (19) for locking

the tilting drive (14) is provided.
