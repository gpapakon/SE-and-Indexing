<ABSTRACT>
A VCR or laserdisc player (100) includes circuitry (110) 
for detecting a code provided by VCR tapes, tape cassettes, or laser 

videodiscs, which indicates that the material recorded on the 
videotape or videodisc has been recorded in a compressed fashion to 

enable proper playback on a 16 X 9 television receiver (150). In 
response to detection of this code, the VCR or laserdisc player (100) 

applies a DC signal to the chrominance output terminal (C) of its S-Video 
connector. Circuitry (Q,R120,R122,R124,C4) in the television 

receiver (150) detects the DC signal on the chrominance terminal (C) 
of its S-Video input connector, and controls a wide-screen processor 

to expand the image by displaying it over the entire width of the 16 
X 9 display screen (FIGURES 2a,2c).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns television receivers which may play
television pictures previously recorded in widescreen (i.e., 16 by 9
aspect ratio) format.NTSC television instruments having 16 X 9 aspect ratio
picture tubes and format converters to convert 4 X 3 aspect ratio
NTSC signals to a form suitable for display on a 16 X 9 display are
now available. It therefore becomes desirable to have VCR tapes
that play back signals electrically in the NTSC format but which
were optically produced in a 16 X 9 aspect ratio. These signals
may be produced by special lenses or by 16 X 9 CCD imagers. U. S.
Patent US-A-4 897 722 (Flory), entitled WIDESCREEN TELEVISION
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM UTILIZING CONVENTIONAL EQUIPMENT
INCLUDING A CAMERA AND VCR, issued 30 January 1990,
discloses a system in which a
conventional NTSC format video camera utilizes an anamorphic
lens to optically produce images in a 16 X 9 aspect ratio. That is,
the anamorphic lens compresses the image horizontally by a
factor of 4/3, which is the exact amount need to compensate for
the expansion of a 4 X 3 aspect ratio NTSC image by a factor of
4/3 which automatically occurs when it is displayed on a wider 16
X 9 aspect ratio display screen.If a such an optically-compressed NTSC video signal is
played back to a standard 4 X 3 television receiver, the image
would appear correct in height, but compressed in width, or
"skinny". However, as noted above, a horizontal expansion of 4 X
3 aspect ratio signals occurs automatically when these signals are
displayed on a 16 X 9 aspect ratio display screen because the time
to scan a single horizontal line in both aspect ratios is the same.
In other words, the same amount of video data is spread out over
a greater distance in the same amount of time as the electron 
beam scans across the longer distance of the 16 X 9 aspect ratio
display screen.Unfortunately, if a standard 4 X 3 image is displayed
on a 16 X 9 display screen, the same automatic horizontal
expansion takes place, making everything appear "fatter". In
order to prevent this undesirable display, the 4 X 3 image is
typically displayed on the 16 X 9 display screen in its proper 4 X
3 aspect ratio, by displaying blank vertical bars on each side of
the 4 X 3 image to fill up the remainder of the 16 X 9.
International patent application PCT/ US91/03746, filed 29 May
1991, published as WO-A-91/19397 on 12 December 1991, (Willis),
entitled SYNCHRONIZING SIDE BY SIDE PICTURES,
discloses a system in which a 4 X 3
image is "speeded up" to enable the video data to be

<CLAIMS>
A video signal processing arrangement compressed;

a video signal input (Y, C) for receiving a video
signal corresponding to a video image;
detecting means (Q1, R120, R124, R122, C4) for
detecting an indication signal, said indication signal

representing a wide screen aspect ratio of said video image;
adjustment means for adjusting said aspect ratio of a
displayed video image in response to said indication

signal;
characterised in that
said video signal input comprises a separate
chrominance input terminal (C) and a separate luminance

input terminal (Y) for receiving chrominance and
luminance signal components of said video signal

separately;
said detecting means are connected to said chrominance input terminal (C)
for detecting said

indication signal, wherein said indication signal is a DC
signal.
