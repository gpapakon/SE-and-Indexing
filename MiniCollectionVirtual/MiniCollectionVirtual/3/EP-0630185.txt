<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for cutting out and plugging the anal orifice of slaughtered animals in any slaughtering facility, particularly high-throughput abattoirs. The method comprises cutting out the rectum (16) of the animal (17) with a cylindrical cutter arranged around a centering mandrel (9) and provided with side openings for immediately removing any waste matter that becomes stuck within the cutter, and injecting ground fat or a similar material into the anus with a pressurizing device (3) controlled by automation equipment of the facility, said device being connected via a flexible duct (6) to an inner channel (7) in the centering mandrel for the tool (9) for cutting out (8) the rectum. The method and device are suitable for use in any slaughtering facility, particularly high-throughput abattoirs.

Process for plugging the anal orifice of animals for 
consumption after slaughter, in particular for use in 

industrial slaughter installations operating at high work rate 
including routing of the rectum with routing tool (8),
 
characterized in that ground greases are injected into the 

rectum (16) of the animal (17) using a pressurizing device (3) 
controlled by a motor-driven valve (5) capable of being 

operated by the installation automation equipment and connected 
by a flexible pipe (6) to an axial internal canal (7) provided 

to this effect in the centring mandrel (9) of the rectum 
routing tool (8) and terminating at the end of the mandrel 

nose, the said motor-driven valve being opened when the said 
centring mandrel penetrates into the rectum so as to form a 

plug (18) of grease which infiltrates all the spaces and 
ensures total seal. 
Process as per claim 1 characterized in that the 
grease used is that withdrawn from the treated animals 

themselves.  
 
Device for plugging the anal orifice of animals for 
consumption after slaughter including a routing tool (8) for 

the application of the process according to the aforesaid 
claims, characterized in that it consists of a grinder (1) 

discharging through a non-return valve (2) into a pressurizing 
chamber (3) whose outlet (4) is controlled by a motor-driven 

valve (5) capable of being piloted by the installation 
automation equipment and connected by a flexible pipe (6) to an 

axial internal channel (7), provided in the centring mandrel 
(9) of the rectum routing tool (8) and terminating at the end 

of the nose of this mandrel, for injecting ground grease into 
the rectum of the animal (17). 
Device as per claim 3 characterized in that the 
grinder unit (1) consists of a screw (10) rotating in a sheath 

driven by an electric motor (11) and fed from a hopper (12), 
the said sheath terminating by a non-return valve (2). 
Device as per any one of the claims 3 and 4 
characterized in that the pressurizing chamber (3) takes the 

form of a cylinder closed by a mobile piston (13) on which a 
carefully determined force is exercised by a spring (14) or 

other means. 
Device as per claim 3 characterized in that the 
routing tool (8) consists of a cylindrical knife (20) with 

circular blade (21) whose wall is equipped with side openings 
(23) to allow permanent evacuation of undesirable waste, the 

said openings being plugged during penetration of the routing 
tool into the rectum (16) of the animal (17) using an external  

 
cylindrical sleeve (24) which can slide axially on the wall of 

the knife (20). 
Device as per claim 6 characterized in that the knife 
wall (20) side openings (23) are executed by an interruption of 

the said wall, this latter being fixed on the body of the knife 
by longitudinal spacers (22). 
Device as per claim 6 characterized in that the side 
openings (23) of the knife wall are executed by cutting out 

sections of the said wall. 
Device as per any one of claim 6 to 8, characterized 
in that the cylindrical sleeve (24) comprises a bevelled front 

edge (26). 
Device as per any one of claims 6 to 9 characterized 
in that the cylindrical sleeve (24) is manufactured from a 

plastic material having self-lubricating properties. 
Device as per any one of claims 6 to 10 characterized 
in that movement of the cylindrical sleeve (24) is caused by 

devices controlled by the automation systems of the slaughter 
installation. 
Device as per any one of claim 6 to 11 characterized 
in that the cylindrical sleeve (24) is moved by two hydraulic 

cylinders (25).
