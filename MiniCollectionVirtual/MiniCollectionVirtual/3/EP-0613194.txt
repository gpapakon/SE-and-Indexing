<ABSTRACT>
In the motor according to the invention, the excitation of natural vibrations in the stator consisting of a hollow cylinder takes place by means of actors which are arranged on flattenings of the outer and/or inner cylindrical surface of the hollow cylinder. In particular, piezoceramic actors adhesively bonded to the flattenings are provided. The torque is picked up by a rotor brought into frictional contact with the inner or outer cylindrical surface.
