<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid the bending of the mobile table (3) or its die-clamping plate with the clamping surface (17) in a press with a press table (2) and a mobile table (3), use is made of supporting devices (19) which can be adjusted vertically by actuation, are arranged essentially in the central area of the individual mobile table and here act between the press table (2) and mobile table (3) or a die-clamping plate.

<CLAIMS>
Press having one or more press rams (1), which
can be moved up and down, with tool top parts (4) for the

forming, having one or more stationary press tables (2)
and one or more sliding tables (3), which can be moved

out of the press and into the latter for the tool change,
with tool bottom parts (5), the sliding tables (3) being

fitted via bearing walls (10) on bearing walls (11) of
the press table (2) for operation, characterized by the

use of supporting devices (19) which are adjustable in
the height dimension by actuation, are arranged

essentially in the central region of the individual
sliding table and act here between the press table (2)

and sliding table (3) or a tool-clamping plate.
Press according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the rest surfaces (15, 16) of the bearing walls (10, 11)

of the press table (2) and sliding table (3) are flat
surfaces when not under load.
Press according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the rest surfaces (15, 16) between the press table (2)

and sliding table (3) are formed on the press table (2)
or, if appropriate, on the sliding table (3), or even on

both of the tables (2, 3) in accordance with a bending
line (13) which would result for a flat press table (2
