<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a scaffolding with adjustable base width, in the case of which horizontal crossmembers (3), assuming a mutual distance from one another, are connected to one another by an access platform. Vertical scaffolding frames (2) with horizontal working platforms are arranged on the crossmembers (3) and connected to the crossmembers. In order to be able to change the base width in a simple and operationally reliable manner with low production costs, it is proposed to fit an extension arm (8) at the free ends of the crossmembers (3) by means of a coupling fitting (7), an adjustment foot (5') being fitted on said extension arm.

Scaffolding, consisting of horizontal girders (3) mutually spaced 
apart from each other, the length of which girders (3) is changeable,and 

which are connected with each other by an access platform, in which vertical 
scaffolding parts are fastened on the girders (3) and at each end of the girders 

(3) an adjustment foot (5,5') is detachably arranged and also at least at one free 
end of each girder (3) an extension arm (8) is arranged with an adjustment foot 

(5,5') by means of a coupling mount (7), characterised in that the extension arm 
(8) is arranged so as to be swivellable. 
Scaffolding according to Claim 1, characterised in that the swivel axis (13) 
of the coupling mount (7) is arranged so as to be vertical. 
Scaffolding according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the extension 
arm (8) has at its free end a vertical tube part (6) in which the adjustment foot 

(5.5') is adjustably mounted. 
Scaffolding according to Claim 3, characterised in that the coupling 
mount (7) is constructed substantially from a clamping mount (23) and from a 

second mounting arranged at a vertical distance therefrom. 
Scaffolding according to Claim 4, characterised in that the clamping 
mount (23) is constructed as a scaffolding coupling in order to embrace the tube 

part (6) of the girder (3). 
Scaffolding according to one of Claims 4 or 5, characterised in that the 
second mounting is constructed in the form of an eye (12) which embraces the 

tube part (6) of the girder (3).  
 
Scaffolding according to one of Claims 4 and 5, characterised in that the 
second mounting is constructed as a chamfered hook part (19) which at a 

horizontal distance from the tube part (6) of the girder (3) has a mounting (24) 
which partially embraces the girder (3).
