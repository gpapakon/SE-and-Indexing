<DESCRIPTION>
 TONE GENERATING CIRCUITFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the electronic generation of audio frequency signals and in particular to an electronic circuit that provides high efficiency in operation using novel waveforms for the reproduction of audible tones within selected frequencies. The circuit may be implemented in an electronic siren amplifier which is used in an early warning or detection system.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An electronic siren produces audio frequency signals which vary or sweep within a desired frequency range. The electronic siren typically includes an input signal source, an amplifier circuit and a loudspeaker. The ability of the amplifier circuit to adjust power output in these arrangements is desirable to mimic the reproduction of a mechanical siren. However, the physical limitations of the loudspeaker and other circuit elements prevent the application of signals of low frequency and long durations which are beyond the safe operating region of power versus the frequency of the electronic loudspeaker, as loud speakers are damaged with excessive power levels below the cut off frequencies of the horn or driver of the electronic loudspeaker. 

 Known electronic sound systems typically produce a sine wave input signal that is passed to the amplifier circuit and thereafter to the loudspeaker. Conventional electronic reproduction of siren tones, however, results in inefficiencies when using sine wave input and resultant output signals. Inasmuch as the amplifier circuit in these arrangements is comprised of active devices which operate in the active region, large quantities of energy are dissipated therein during operation. The use of such arrangements is therefore undesirable, particularly when the preferred or only available power is supplied to the unit with a fixed capacity power source, such as a battery.Accordingly, conventional electronic sirens employ the use of a square wave input signal to improve the efficiency of the unit. In these arrangements, the active devices in the amplifier circuit operate as switches in the saturation region. In order to vary output power of an electronic siren that receives a square wave input signal, the voltage supplying the active devices must be varied. Because of the difficulty in efficiently varying supply voltage, such square wave amplifiers are usually operated at a fixed voltage (and therefore power which changes only as a function of the impedance of the horn/driver combination) output.Both the sine wave and square
