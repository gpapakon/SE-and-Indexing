<ABSTRACT>
A non-metallic rope has the interstices both 
within and between its strands filled with a water-blocking 

material and is enclosed in a close-fitting 
water-tight sheath of electrically insulating material. 
The rope may be made of polyester, polyamide 
(including aramid) or other conventional, preferably 

synthetic, fibres and may be of any conventional strand 
structure. 
The water-blocking material may be of any of the 
three classes conventionally used for this purposes in 

electric and/or optical cables, namely 

1 greasy materials, such as silicone greases, 
petroleum jellies; 
2 soft polymeric material, such as silicone rubbers; 
and 
3 materials that swell to form local water blocks on 
exposure to moisture, such as polyacrylate powders. 
The sheath should ideally be moisture-repellent, 
flame retardant and incombustible, but standard cable-sheathing 

compositions can be used. 
The rope is suitable for use in live-line 
modifications to and refurbishment of overhead power 

lines, especially the addition of optical communications 
circuits by earth-wire replacement or by wrap-on or 

self-supporting all-dielectric optical cables.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to non-metallic ropes and 
their use in relation to overhead electric lines. There is currently much activity in the addition 
of optical telecommunications circuits to electric high-voltage 
overhead lines, in most cases either by the 
replacement of the existing earth wire with one 
incorporating optical fibers or by adding an optical 
cable either as a self-supporting element of the line 
for example an "all dielectric cable, or as a wrapped-on 
addition to the earth wire or phase conductor. If 
clearances are adequate, it is possible to install 
optical cables onto earth wires or to install self 
supporting cables while the phase conductors are on 
load, but this requires the use of electrically 
insulating pulling ropes. Similarly, in systems having 
two independent three phase circuits, cable can be 
installed on phase conductors of one circuit while the 
other circuit is on load. However, when the electrical power lines are on  
 
load, electrical currents may be capacitively induced on 
the pulling rope due to the distributed capacitance 
between the rope and the power lines. The voltages on 
the rope will tend to reach a maximum at mid-way between 
the points at which it is earthed, while the current 
flowing along the rope will be greatest at the earthing 
points. The rope will normally be earthed at the 
pulling tower and at a minimum of one other place on the 
earthed conductor. Under dry conditions the induced 
currents will be relatively small due to the relatively 
high longitudinal resistance of the rope, but under wet 
conditions when the resistance of the rope is much 
lower, much higher currents will be induced. Joule 
heating of the rope by the induced currents can cause a 
short length of the rope to become dry, usually in the 
region of a tower where the current is highest. When 
this happens the major part of the induced voltage is 
dropped across the short dry band due to its high 
longitudinal resistance, and so-called "dry-band arcing" 
may occur. Such dry band arcing is the same phenomenon 
as may occur with self supporting all dielectric optical 
cables, but because ambient water can penetrate ropes, 
the arcing may occur within the body of the rope rather 
than on the surface as happens with optical cables. 
Since the heat generated by arcing within the body is 
not so readily removed from the arc source, catastrophic 
failure of the rope may occur by burning. Greasing of the rope is only partly effective and  
 
risks contamination that presents
