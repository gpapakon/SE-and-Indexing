<ABSTRACT>
By the oxidation of olefins having 16 to 70 C atoms by means of chromosulphuric acid in a single- or multi-stage process in at least one reactor having a narrow residence time spectrum, carboxylic acid mixtures can be produced. These can be processed with monoalcohols or polyols such as glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol or sorbitol to give esters and partial esters or to give mixtures of such esters. By reaction with basic oxides or metal hydroxides, the corresponding soaps of the carboxylic acids can be produced by direct reaction or by reprecipitation. By reaction with amines or aminoalcohols the amides, amido esters and amino esters are obtained.   These products are distinguished by a pale colour, good heat stability and a wide application spectrum.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the continuous preparation of 
relatively high-molecular-weight, linear aliphatic 

carboxylic acids by oxidation of olefins having from 
16 to 70 carbon atoms with approximately 1 molar, 

based on CrO
3
, chromic/sulfuric acid at a temperature 
of from 90 to 200Â°C and a pressure of from 

100 mbar to 20 bar, which comprises carrying out the 
reaction in cocurrent mode in at least one reactor 

having a narrow residence time spectrum, the mixing 
of the reactants being carried out by the steam 

formed as a result of the heat of reaction and the 
reaction gas and also additional blowing-in of air. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction is carried out in a cascaded bubble column 

reactor. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction is carried out in a plurality of stages, 

used chromic/sulfuric acid being separated off after 
each stage and the amount of chromic/sulfuric acid 

required for the oxidation being continuously 
metered in in portions at the beginning of each 

stage. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein C
20
-C
50
 
olefins having internal double bonds or having 

vinylidene double bonds or having vinyl double bonds 
or mixtures of these compounds are used.  

 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
separation of the organic phase and the inorganic 

phase in the separation vessel is accelerated by the 
addition of surface-active compounds.
