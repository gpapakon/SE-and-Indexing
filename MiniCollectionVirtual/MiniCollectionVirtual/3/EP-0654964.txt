<ABSTRACT>
A teat for feeding liquids to animals has fastening means enabling the teat to be fastened to a source of liquid such as a pipe or drum in use to project outwardly from the source. The teat has a resilient outer end (20a) which is closed apart from a slit (16a) in it which slit is itself normally adapted to be closed by the resilience to provide a sufficient liquid seal. The closed outer end is preferably concave, coned, cusped or otherwise re-entrant. Reinforcing means such as webs (15a) are located, preferably internally on either side of the slit so that if the end of the teat is squashed or compressed by sucking forces exerted by the animal, with components along the direction of slit, the reinforcing means causes the slit to be pulled open, thereby allowing liquid to flow out of it in use. The pulling action allows an acceptable flow rate from a comparatively small slit which is less prone to leak than a large slit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved teat. Where animals are
to be artificially reared on milk or other liquids, teats are
usually the preferred means of facilitating a young animal to
self-feed.For example, in order to feed numerous calves at one time, there
may be a row of teats projecting horizontally around the top
perimeter of a container and those teats would normally be
connected to tubes equipped with one-way valves to enable liquid
to be drawn up from the bottom of the container when the teat is
sucked. Obviously in such a construction, as long as the teat
level is above the liquid level, there is no danger of
appreciable quantities of the liquid leaking out of the teat
under gravitational pressure.However, where the teats are to be gravity fed they may be
situated, for example, at the base of a container so that there
is a head of liquid above the teats of perhaps up to 2 metres,
and it then becomes imperative that the teats be self-sealing
and able to resist that amount of pressure.WO 85/02323 discloses a method for feeding ruminants and a liquid
feed dispensing device. The device includes an outlet means preferably
comprising a teat-like member made of a resilient material such as
natural or synthetic rubber or plastics. The free-end of the teat-like
member is provided with a slit-like opening which is at least
partly defined by relatively stiff opposite teat wall parts tiltable
about a fulcrum wall portion so as to open the slit-like opening
by compressing the teat-like member. The fulcrum wall portions are
formed by a stiff material embedded in the teat wall. The present invention consists in a teat having fastening means
enabling the teat to be fastened to a source of liquid in use to
project outwardly from the source, the teat having an outer end
which is closed apart from a slit in it which slit is itself
normally adapted to be closed to provide a sufficient liquid
seal, the outer end of the teat being made of a resilient 
material with reinforcing means on either side of the slit so
that if the end of the teat is squashed or compressed by forces
with components along the direction of slit, the reinforcing
means causes the slit to be opened, thereby allowing liquid to
flow out of it in use.The advantage of the present invention is that a small slit can
be used with better sealing characteristics while ensuring a
high volume of liquid is released through the slit by stretching
it open when sucking occurs.The preferred forms of the present invention will now be
described with reference

<CLAIMS>
A teat having fastening means enabling the teat to be
fastened to a source of liquid in use to project outwardly from

the source, the teat having an outer end (9) which is closed apart
from a slit (11) in it which slit is itself normally adapted to be

closed to provide a sufficient liquid seal,
whereby the outer end (9) of the teat is made of a resilient material,

characterised in that
reinforcing means (12,13) are located on either side of the slit (11)

so that if the
end of the teat (9) is squashed or compressed by forces with

lateral components along the direction of slit (11), the
reinforcing means (12,13)

causes the slit (11) to be opened, thereby allowing liquid to flow
out of it in use.
A teat as claimed in claim 1 wherein the closed outer end (9) is
characterised by being concave, coned, cusped or otherwise

re-entrant.
A teat as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
reinforcing means (12,13) are external of the teat.
A teat as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
reinforcing means (12,13) are internal of the teat.
A teat as claimed in claim 4 wherein the teat is
substantially cylindrical, having a hollow centre and is

characterised by the reinforcing means (12,13) comprising webs bridging
between the inner surface of the end portion and the inner

cylindrical wall.
A teat as claimed in claim 5 wherein there are two such webs
which are co-planar on the same diameter at right angles to the

slit.
A teat as claimed in claim 6 wherein the web walls are about
0.75mm thick. 
A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the length of the slit (11) is about 6mm.
A teat as claimed in claim 8 wherein the slit (11) terminates at
an internal indentation or cavity at each end.
A teat as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the whole teat is made of a flexible material and the fastening

means are characterised by comprising a substantially circular
flange portion adapted to lie on the inside of the liquid

source, such as a container, in use, a substantially cylindrical
portion adapted to pass through a hole in the container, in use,

and locking means adapted to press on the outer wall of the
container, in use, to hold the teat in position with the flange

against the internal wall of the container.
A teat as claimed in claim 10 wherein the locking means
comprises a circumferential rib.
A teat as claimed in claim 10 wherein the locking means is
in the form of an integral circumferential rib (23) of substantially

triangular cross-section.
A teat as claimed in any one of claims 10, 11 or 12, wherein
the wall thickness of the teat is thicker at its inner end which

abuts the container, in use.
A teat as claimed in any one of claims 10 to 13 wherein the
substantially circular flange (25) has two opposite flats (26) at its

circumference which are aligned substantially at right angles to
said slits (16a).
