<ABSTRACT>
A method for avoiding out-of-ordering of frames in a network, wherein the method includes the steps of providing at least one first type of queue in a network switch, providing at least one second type of queue in a network switch, receiving an incoming packet, first storing the incoming packet in the at least one first type of queue if the packet is from a first source, second storing the incoming packet in the at least one second type of queue if the packet is from a second source, and sending the incoming packet to a desired destination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for preventing out-of-ordering of frames in a network switch.The present invention advances network switching technology in a switch suitable for use in Ethernet, fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, and other types of network environments which require high performance switching of data packets or data cells. A switch utilizing the disclosed elements, and a system performing the disclosed steps, provides cost and operational advantages over the prior art.EP A 0 859 492 describes a fair queuing system with adaptive bandwidth redistribution, the system comprising a plurality of per-connection queues, a weighted fair-queuing scheduler, a sensing device for sensing a presence or absence of packets in queues indicating availability of excess bandwidth, and a state dependent scheduler for redistributing excess bandwidth upon sensing of queues absent packets.WO A 98 25381 relates to a network adaptor driver with a destination based ordering scheme where multiple packets of data are ordered before transmit to achieve better utilization of distributed network resources.According to the invention, there are provided methods for preventing out-of-ordering of frames in a network switch, as set forth by the subject matter of independent claims 1 and 3.Further advantageous features are defined in the dependent claims.The objects and features of the invention will be more readily understood with reference to the following description and the attached drawings, wherein:

<CLAIMS>
A method for preventing out-of-ordering of frames in a network switch (10), comprising the steps of:

receiving a first portion of a string of packets from a source port on a first port (13, 15);
transferring said first portion of said string of packets to a second port (13,15) for transmission to a destination;
characterized by
 further comprising:

sending an indicator from said first port (13,15) to said second port (13,15);
receiving said indicator at said second port (13,15);
sending a response indicator from said second port (13,15) to said first port (13,15); and
receiving a second portion of said string of packets from said source port on a third port (13,15).
The method as recited in claim 1, wherein said step of sending the response indicator further comprises the step of determining if said first portion of said string of packets transferred to said second port (13,15) has been transmitted to said destination prior to sending said response indicator.
A method for preventing out-of-ordering of frames in a network switch (10), said method comprising the steps of:

receiving packets on a first ingress port (13,15) from a source port;
transmitting said packets from said first ingress port (13,15) to an egress port (13,15) for transmission to a destination;
determining to switch said receiving of said packets to a second ingress port (13,15);
characterized by
 further comprising:

sending a switch indicator from said first ingress port (13,15) to said egress port (13,15);
determining when to send a response switch indicator from said egress port (13,15) to said first ingress port (13,15);
sending said response switch indicator from said egress port (13,15) to said first ingress port (13,15);
forwarding said response switch indicator to said source port; and
switching said receiving of said packets to said second ingress port (13,15).
The method as recited in claim 3, wherein said step of determining when to send a response switch indicator further comprises the step of waiting to send said response switch indicator until a number of packets in said egress port (13,15) are transmitted from said egress port (13,15) to said destination.
