<ABSTRACT>
The use of an organofluorinated hydrocarbon compound as a binder for powders, for the preparation of cosmetic compositions in powder form.   The invention also relates to a cosmetic composition for the skin, consisting of a particulate phase containing pigments and/or fillers and of a fatty phase, characterised in that it contains 1.01 to 35% by weight of at least one organofluorinated hydrocarbon compound.
