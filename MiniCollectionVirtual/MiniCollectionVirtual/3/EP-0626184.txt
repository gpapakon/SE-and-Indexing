<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for playing intellectual games is disclosed. The device consists 
of a spherical body with pre-determined inter-connecting grooves (16,18), 

wherein slidable pins (24) are affixed. The exposed surface of the slidable 
pins (24) are coded to carry any desired visual representations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for intellectual exercises and in particular 
to a spherical device with a plurality of grooves laid out in a pre-determined 
manner to accommodate slidable pin-heads. The grooves are laid out in a 
pre-determined manner and are dimensioned in a manner to control the sliding 
movement of pin-heads from one part of the spherical device to another part. Devices for games wherein the parts of the surfaces are movable from one 
position to another position are generally cuboidal in shape. The parts of the 
surface that are moveable are generally square in shape. It is an object of the present invention to provide a substantially spherical 
device wherein pin-heads can be slidably positioned to achieve any desired 
surface configuration of pin heads. According to the invention there is provided a device for playing intellectual 
exercises wherein the device is substantially spherical in shape and comprises 
of a plurality of inter-connecting grooves laid out in a desired pattern and 
a plurality of pins slidable along the inter-connecting grooves. In a 
preferred embodiment the device is spherical in shape. The device includes 
a two Y-shaped inter-connecting grooves, one at the diametrically opposite 
sides of the sphere. Between these two Y-shaped grooves, are a plurality 
of X-shaped grooves. A plurality of slidable pins are introduced into the 
grooves. The exposed external surface of the pin is coded to carry any 
desired visual demarcations. The islets formed by the inter-connecting 
grooves are secured to a core body within the spherical device.  In another aspect, the device includes a web of inter-connecting grooves 
substantially all over the surface with at least one partially free surface area 
with at least one groove traversing the said free surface area and connecting 
the web of inter-connecting grooves. As before, a plurality of slidable pins 
are introduced into the grooves.
 
In order that the invention may be more clearly understood reference will now 
be made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred 
embodiment of the invention. Fig. 1 illustrates a spherical device with pin-heads all assembled. Fig. 2 illustrates side the spherical device of Fig. 1, but with the pin-heads 
removed to show the grooves clearly. Fig. 3 illustrates a top view of the spherical device of Fig. 2 (the bottom 
view corresponds). Fig. 3A is a diagrammatic representation of a vertical section of the spherical 
device. Fig. 4 illustrates a diagrammatic sectional
