<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 3-substituted thiophenes in which the substituent is a C4-C18-alkyl group. According to the invention, the preparation is carried out by allowing an alkali metal salt of a C4-C18-alkyl-succinic acid to react with a compound of sulfur and phosphorus, e.g. tetraphosphorus decasulfide, in an organic solvent at a temperature of 100-180  DEG C, the product obtained being 3-(C4-C18-alkyl)thiophene. The said reaction may be the last step in a process in which the initial material is maleic acid anhydride with which  alpha -C4-C18-alkene is combined so that C4-C18-alkenylsuccinic acid anhydride is obtained, whereafter this is hydrogenated catalytically to produce C4-C18-alkylsuccinic acid anhydride. This is thereafter reacted with an alkali metal hydroxide so that an alkali salt of the C4-C18-alkylsuccinic acid is obtained, which salt is reacted with a compound of sulfur and phosphorus to produce 3-(C4-C18-alkyl)thiophene, which constitutes the final product.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for the preparation of 3-substituted thiophenesThe invention relates to a process for the preparation of 3- substituted thiophenes in which the substituent consists of a C4-C18 alkyl group.It is known that the preparation of 3-substituted thiophene is more difficult than the preparation of 2-substituted thiophene However, 3-substituted thiophene is a desirable intermediate o final product in various applications, for example as an herbi cide or a fungicide. Certain 3-substituted thiophenes can also be used as monomers in the preparation of, for example, elec¬ trically conductive polymers.3-substituted thiophene can in principle be prepared in two different ways: by using as the initial material a thiophene o a thiophene provided with a modifiable 3-substituent, or by using as the initial material an acyclic compound. Substituted thiophenes can, of course, also be prepared by other methods, but in that case the products are usually 2-substituted.The best known way of using thiophene as the initial material is the bromination of thiophene. 3-Bromothiophene can be pre¬ pared, for example according to EP publication 299 586, cata- lytically from 2,5-dibromothiophene and thiophene. 3-Bromothio phene is one of the most important intermediates from which a wide variety of 3-substituted thiophenes are obtained, for example by means of Grignard reactions, by lithiation, or by oxidation. The use of 3-bromothiophene as the initial material in a production process is, however, hampered by the undesir¬ able bromides formed as byproducts and by the difficult reac¬ tion conditions, such as an unsuitable temperature and an iner atmosphere. 

 The preparation of 3-substituted thiophenes by using an acycl compound as the initial material has been studied extensively. These processes often have the disadvantage that they produce large amounts of 2-substituted thiophenes as byproducts. Some examples of these processes are the use of various mercaptans or thioethers as the initial material (Butler, A.R., Henry, J.B., J. Chem. Soc, B, 1970, or Campaigne, E., Monroe, P.A., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 76 (1954), 2445). 3-substituted thiophene can also be prepared from other compounds which contain either double bonds or other functional groups (Veal, .T., Grinter, T.J., EP 38121, or Duus, F. , Tetrahedron, 32 (1976), 2817).As mentioned above, many of these processes known to an expert in the art produce large amounts of undesirable 2-substituted thiophene compounds and isomers, the separating of which cause difficulties.
