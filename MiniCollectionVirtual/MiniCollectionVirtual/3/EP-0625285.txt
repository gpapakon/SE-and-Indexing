<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for the anisotropic etching of features defined by an etching mask, preferably recesses with precisely defined sides in silicon, produced using a plasma etching technique. The invention calls for the etched features to have an extremely high degree of anisotropy while ensuring high mask selectivity. This is achieved by carrying out the anisotropic etching procedure in separate polymerization and etching steps which alternate with each other.

structures in a silicon substrate which are exactly

defined laterally by an etching mask, by respectively
alternating separate implementation of etching and

polymerization steps, which are controlled
independently of one another, the silicon substrate
