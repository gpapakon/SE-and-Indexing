<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame retardant
and a flame-retardant resin and/or rubber composition
containing said flame retardant. More specifically, it
relates to a flame retardant which exhibits excellent flame
retardancy when incorporated into a resin or rubber and a
flame-retardant resin and/or composition containing said
flame retardant.The requirement of flame retardancy for a resin
and rubber (to be simply referred to as "resin" hereinafter)
is getting severer year after year, and for satisfying this
requirement, there is conventionally employed a method in
which a so-called halogen-containing flame retardant,
typified by a combination of an organic halide and antimony
trioxide, is incorporated into a resin. However, the
following problems on a halogen-containing flame retardant
have come to be recognized; it is liable to generate halogen
gas during the processing, and it corrodes an apparatus,
etc. When combusted, it generates a large amount of toxic
smoke to threaten human life, and it corrodes peripheral
equipment to terminate the function of the equipment.Aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide contain
no halogen and are free from the above problems. These
hydroxides are attracting attention, and the consumption
thereof is increasing year after year. Since, however,
aluminum hydroxide starts dehydration at about 190°C, it
makes almost all resins foam in processing, and deteriorates
their product value. The temperature for the processing is
therefore required to be lower than the above temperature, 
and the resins to which aluminum hydroxide can be
incorporated are limited in kind.Magnesium hydroxide starts dehydration around
340°C, and it can therefore be used with almost all resins
without the foaming problem. Further, the present invention
and some other coinventors have invented a magnesium
hydroxide suitable as a flame retardant and a process for
the production thereof, and magnesium hydroxide is beginning
to be a mainstream in the field of halogen-free flame
retardants. However, for imparting a resin with sufficient
flame retardancy, magnesium hydroxide is required to be used
in a large amount as well as aluminum hydroxide. For
example, the amount of magnesium hydroxide required per 100
parts by weight of a resin is about 150 parts by weight or
more. Further, magnesium hydroxide is relatively expensive,
and it hence increases the cost much more than a halogen-containing
flame retardant. The use of magnesium hydroxide
which is a safe flame retardant is not necessarily
satisfactor
