<ABSTRACT>
Object
 : To provide a sheet counter system in which even 
in the case where counting of bills having a long length 

is carried out, the counter system is capable of securely 
stacking processed bills, and even in the case where counting 

of bills is carried out, there is no possibility that 
a bill subsequent to a bill of the batch number may be fed 

out. 
Constitution
 : In the case where the length of a bill 10 
is less than a length reference value, braking of a DC motor 

M₁ starts when the front end of an n-th sheet (a predetermined 
set value) which has been fed out is detected by a 

counting sensor S₂, while in the case where the length of 
the bill 10 is greater than the length reference value, 

braking of the DC motor M₁ starts when a carrying distance 
after the front end of the n-th sheet which has been fed 

out is detected by the counting sensor S₂ reaches a predetermined 
distance given by a difference between the length 

of the bill and the length reference value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet counter system, e.g., a
sheet counter or a sheet discriminating counter, etc., viz., a
system for carrying out counting processing of bills, checks or
slips, etc.US-E-RE 29 470 shows a document-handler for feeding, separating, counting
and stacking sheets which includes a means for anticipating jam conditions
to protect the counting mechanism and the sheets from being damaged.A conventional sheet counter system generally has a feeding
part for feeding out, one by one, sheets or the like stacked
within a hopper section; a carrying part for carrying the sheets
or the like fed out by the feeding part; a counting part for
counting the sheets or the like carried by the carrying part; and
a stacking part for stacking the sheets of the like counted by
the counting part.The essential part of one example of such conventional sheet
counter system will now be described with reference to Figs. 15A
and 15B.In these figures, a kicker roller 32, feed rollers 33, 33
(see Fig. 15B) at the both ends of a rotary shaft 41, and a gate
roller 34 constitute feeding (drawing) means for feeding out
sheets or the like stacked or accumulated within a hopper section
31. Practically, two kicker rollers 32 are provided along their
common axis, however, the explanation will be made with employing
only one kicker roller. Respective components of this feeding
means are driven by a drive motor (not shown).Furthermore, a feed roller 33' at the central portion, a
roller 35 opposite to the feed roller 33', and acceleration
rollers 36, 37 constitute carrying (transfer) means for carrying
(transferring) sheets or the like fed out by the feeding means.
Such acceleration rollers 36, 37 are also driven by the
above-described drive motor. The sheets or the like which have
been fed out by the above-described feeding means are carried
(transferred) along a carrier (transferring) path formed by guide
plates 39a, 39b. In this example, the acceleration roller 36 is
caused to have large inertia. Thus, acceleration rollers 36, 37 
are driven by inertia even after the drive motor is stopped so
that they carry or transfer sheets or the like.A stacker 40 including a stacker fan 38 which represent
practical coaxial two stacker fans constitutes stacking means.
A stacker fan 38 stacks sheets or the like carried by the
carrying means into a stacker 40. This stacker fan 38 is driven
by an independent motor.A light emitting element S and a light receiving element S'
detect sheets or the like and constitute counting means for

<CLAIMS>
A sheet counter system comprising:

feeding means (12, 13, 14) for feeding out, one by one,
sheets or the like (10) stacked within a hopper section (11);
carrying means (13', 15, 16, 17) for carrying said sheets
or the like fed out by said feeding means;
counting means (S2) for counting said sheets or the like
carried by said carrying means; and
stacking means (20) for stacking said sheets or the like
counted by said counting means;

   characterized in that said sheet counter system further
comprises control means (21) such that in the case where the

length of said sheet or the like is less than a length reference
value, said control means starts braking of said feeding means

when the front end of an n-th sheet
or the like which has been fed out, is detected by said

counting means
whereby n is a predetermined set

value,
while in the case where the length of said sheet

or the like is areater than said length reference value, said
control means starts braking of said feeding means

after the front end of the n-th sheet or the
like which has been fed out is detected by said counting means

at a time point
when the

carrying distance
reaches a predetermined distance to thereby stop feeding by said

feeding means when the counted result of said counting means
reaches said predetermined set value n of sheets.
A sheet counter system as set forth in claim 1, wherein said
predetermined distance is a distance given by a difference

between the length of said sheet or the like and said length
reference value.
A sheet counter system comprising:

feeding means (12, 13, 14) for feeding out, one by one
sheets or the like (10) stacked within a hopper section (11);
carrying means (13', 15, 16, 17) for carrying said sheet
or the like fed out by said feeding means;
counting means (S2) for counting said sheets or the lik
carried by said carrying means; and 
stacking means (20) for stacking said sheets or the like
counted by said counting means;

   characterized in that said sheet counter system further
comprises control means (21) such that when a sheet or the like

preceding by a fixed number m, whereby m is a predetermined set value,
of sheets relative to an n-th sheet, whereby n is a predetermined set

control means starts braking of said feeding means, in the case

where the length of said sheet or the like is less than a length
reference value and in the case where the length of said sheet

or the like is greater than said length reference value and
at a time point when the front end of said n-th sheet or the like

which has been fed out is detected by said counting means
the

feeding speed
is

above a speed reference value, said control means starts braking
of said feeding means when the front end of the n-th sheet or the

like is detected, and in the case where the length of said sheet
or the like is greater than said length reference value and at a time point

when the front end of the n-th sheet or the like
which has been fed out is detected by said counting means, the feeding speed is

smaller than said speed reference value, said control means
starts braking of said feeding means when a carrying distance

from the time of detection of the front end of the n-th sheet or
the like reaches a predetermined distance to thereby stop feeding

by said feeding means when the counted result of said counting
means reaches said predetermined set value n of sheets.
