<ABSTRACT>
In manufacture of a flat glass sheet using the 
float process (1), before annealing of glass carried on 

rollers (3), the glass is conveyed by means (2) of a fluid bed 
formed by a mixture of gasses, in order to cool the 

glass to approximately 600°C before it reaches the 
annealing lehr (Figure 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and a
device for the manufacture of flat glass sheets with
improved optical and mechanical characteristics.In particular, it relates to an improvement in the
transfer operation of the glass sheet strip from the
molten metal tin bath to a roller annealing lehr within
the manufacturing process of flat glass sheets using the
"float" method, known by the state of the art;
furthermore, it also relates to a device for carrying out
said improvement.It is a known fact that flat glass sheets are
manufactured in plants providing a first stage in which
the raw materials are melted and a subsequent stage in
which the glass sheet is formed by floating and sliding
the molten material on a tin bath.These plants, known by the state of the art as float
plants, provide an annealing lehr downstream of the of
molten tin bath, in order to provide the glass sheet
strip with the required mechanical characteristics.The PCT patent application No. 92/16466 filed by the
GLASSTECH company describes a float plant equipped with
an annealing lehr in which the glass sheet strip travels
while being supported on fluid bed.US-A-3,506,422 describes a method and apparatus for
forming a flat glass on a fluid support bed in which a
ribbon of glass is continously lifted from a supporting
molten metal bath onto a gaseous cushion on which the
ribbon is conveyed and conditioned in its temperature
before reaching an annealing lehr so as to avoid damage
to its soft undersurface.The aim of this device is to provide an annealing
process in which the glass sheet strip does not come into
contact with the rollers, as is the case in the
conventional method, in order to improve the optical and
mechanical characteristics of the glass surface itself,
being in this stage still at a high temperature, can 
undergo damage when in contact with rollers.The main inconvenience with the above described
device consists in the fact that it is necessary to carry
out expensive modifications to the existing systems, as
the integral replacement of the annealing lehr, which is
several dozen meters long becomes necessary.Another inconvenience lies in the fact that when
manufacturing a new float plant, the realization of an
annealing lehr having an entirely fluid bed requires high
investments; furthermore the process control is more
difficult.The aim of the present invention is to overcome the
above mentioned problems.It has been surprisingly found that an identical
improvement in the optical and mechanical characteristics
of the
