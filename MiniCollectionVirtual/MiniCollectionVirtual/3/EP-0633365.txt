<ABSTRACT>
A wall or ceiling panelling system and a support 
stringer therefor in which the stringer (10) has a body (12) 

with flanges (16) on which are formed spaced apart support 
lugs (20), each having a pair of hooks (26) thereon and 

preferably a second pair of hooks (34), at least the hooks 
(26) having inclined surfaces (30) which are adapted to 

deflect inwardly, during mounting, outwardly directed beads 
(60) formed on side flanges (58) of a panel (52), the side 

flanges then springing out again to allow the beads (60) to 
become engaged in these hooks (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panelling 
system and to a support stringer therefor. There are many well known different types of 
panelling system for covering walls or ceilings of 
buildings, vehicles or vessels. Most of these employ a 
plurality of panels, each having a pair of side flanges 
extending transversely from the panel in the same sense as 
one another and an outwardly directed bead at the free edge 
of each flange and a plurality of support stringers 
extending transversely, usually perpendicularly, to the 
length of the panels, the support stringers having lugs 
engageable by the beads of the flanges. One example of such a structure is that shown in 
DE-A-2409709. This discloses one particular form of support 
stringer for a panelling system which comprises an elongate 
body having an axis, said body being provided with a 
plurality of support lugs at longitudinally spaced 
locations, each support lug having at least one hook, having 
an inner surface extending at an acute angle to the axis of 
the body and adapted to be engaged by an out-turned bead on 
the edge of a flange of a panel. While such a structure is reasonably satisfactory, 
it can be quite difficult readily to mount the panels and 
dismount the panels as and when necessary. The support stringer of the present invention is 
characterised in that each support lug hook has an outer 
surface spaced from the inner surface, which extends at an 
acute angle to the axis of the body in the same sense as 
that of the acute angle of the inner surface. With such a structure, the bead associated with 
one of the side flanges of the panel can readily be engaged 
with the hook surface and then the panel can be pushed 
towards the support stringer at the other side thereof, the 
acute angle of the outer surface engaging the bead on the 
other flange and forcing it inwardly until the side of the  
 
panel has been pushed sufficiently for the bead to get 
beyond the hook whereupon the bead will spring outwardly and 
engage the hook. Preferably each lug includes a stem portion 
connecting the hook to the body and the stem portion has an 
inclined surface on one or each side extending at an acute 
angle to the axis of the body in the same sense as that of 
the acute angle of the inner surface. Thus, when one wishes 
to demount the panel, one can then push the panel further 
towards the elongate body and the bead will ride along the 
inclined surface of the stem portion deforming the panel 
adequately for the bead to be pushed inwardly

longitudinally spaced locations, each support lug having at 

least one hook (26), having an inner surface (28) extending at an 
acute angle to the axis of the body and adapted to be 

engaged by an out-turned bead (60) on the edge of a flange of a 
panel (50), characterised in that each support lug hook has an 

outer surface (30) spaced from said inner surface, which extends 
at an acute angle to the axis of the body in the same sense 

as that of the acute angle of the inner surface (28).

portion has an inclined surface on one or each side 

extending at an acute angle to the axis (13) of the body in the 
same sense as that of the acute angle of the inner surface. 
A support stringer according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that each of said support lugs (20) includes two 

hooks (26), one on each side, the two hooks (26) having diverging 
inner surfaces (28) and diverging outer surfaces (30). 
A support stringer according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that each of said support lugs 20 is of 

generally triangular form and comprises a further hook (34) on 
one or both sides, the further hook (34) or hooks each having an 

outer surface extending at an acute angle to the axis (13) of the 
body. 
A support stringer according to claim 4, 
characterised in that said further hook (34) or hooks have an 

inner surface inclined at an acute angle to the axis (13) of the 
body (12).  

 
A support stringer according to any preceding 
claim, characterised in that said acute angle is between 55° 

and 65°. 
A support stringer according to any preceding 
claim, characterised in that it includes additional lugs (22) 

interposed between said support lugs, said additional lugs (22) 
including hooks having outer surface extending substantially 

perpendicular to said axis (13) of the body. 
A wall or ceiling panelling system, comprising a 
plurality of panels (52), each having a pair of side flanges (58) 

extending transversely from the panel in the same sense as 
one another, an outwardly directed bead (60) at the free edge of 

each flange, and a plurality of support stringers (10) according 
to any preceding claim, secured to said wall or ceiling with 

the axes in parallel spaced apart array, the outwardly 
directed beads (60) of the panels (52) engaging in said support lug 

hooks. 
A system according to claim 8, characterised in 
that said side flanges comprise a first portion (60) extending 

from the panel, and an inwardly inclined portion extending 
from said first portion to the bead. 
A system according to claim 9, characterised in 
that said first portion (60) is connected to the panel by a 

further inclined portion (70), such that the first portion (60) is 
located outwardly of the side of the panel, and in that said 

further inclined portion (70) and said inclined portion are 
dimensioned relative to the dimensions of the support lugs (20), 

such that, when two adjacent panels are mounted on said 
support stringers (10), with the beads engaged in said hooks (20), 

said first portions (60) of the flanges of adjacent panels are 
immediately adjacent one another.
