<ABSTRACT>
The partial current of exhaust vapours loaded with entrained valuable and/or inert substances is transferred as a steam-product current from drying plants operating with overheated steam as the drying gas, then is at least partially condensed by indirect heat exchange with a cooling medium. The exhaust vapour condensate is subsequently cleaned by at least one distillation step. By recirculating a partial current from the liquid phase of distillation plant (5), exhaust vapour condensate is used for absorbing the condensation energy of the gaseous current of exhaust vapours in an indirect heat exchanger (2). The exhaust vapour condensate thus produced is supplied to the distillation plant (5), where it is brought into a direct energy exchange with the recycled partial current of exhaust vapour condensate drawn from the liquid phase. A partial liquid stream having a higher concentration of entrained valuable and/or inert substances can thus be drawn from the liquid phase of the distillation plant (5). The vapour phase from the distillator (5) is further treated in an appropriate manner.

A process for optimizing disposal of the stream of 
vapors laden with entrained useful and/or ballast materials 

which is removed as a steam product stream from drying 
installations operated with superheated steam as the drying 

gas and is then at least partly condensed by direct and/or 
indirect heat exchange with a cooling medium, characterized 

in that the vapor condensate accumulating is subjected to 
an at least one-stage thermal afterpurification, vapor 

condensate obtained by thermal purification beforehand being used as 
the cooling medium for condensation of the laden vapor stream removed 

from the drying installation and then being subjected to 
thermal postpurification together with the heat of condensation 

taken up by the vapor stream and the laden vapor 
condensate being delivered as aqueous liquid phase to the 

thermal purification stage (distillation stage) and being 
partly evaporated again by the heat of condensation transferred 

while a liquid stream with a high concentration of 
entrained useful and/or ballast materials is removed from 

the sump phase of the distillation stage. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that 
the laden vapor stream removed from the drying installation 

is condensed by a multistep process and the recovered 
partial condensates are subjected to subsequent 

purification. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the sump of the distillation stage is superheated by direct 

or indirect heat exchange with the heat of condensation of 
the vapor stream introduced. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that, to condense the laden vapor stream, an indirect 

heat exchanger is integrated in the sump of the distillation 
stage or, preferably, part of the vapor condensate is 

removed from the sump of the distillation stage, passed  
 

through an indirect heat exchanger to take up the heat of 
condensation of the vapor stream introduced, subsequently 

returned to the distillation stage and directly mixed 
therein with the liquid vapor condensate. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 4, characterized 
in that the heat of condensation is transferred to the 

distillation stage by the fluid carrier medium under elevated 
pressure, preferably under such elevated pressures 

that the circulated stream of vapor condensate (sump) is at 
least predominantly present as liquid phase even after 

leaving the heat exchanger. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the vapor phase removed from the distillation stage 

is recondensed by preferably indirect heat exchange and, if 
desired, is subsequently put to another use. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that any non-condensible gas phases accumulating in the 

individual condensation stages are safely disposed of, and 
which, in particular, are incinerated together with fuel 

gases to produce the overheated steam for the drying 
installation. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the liquid stream enriched with useful and/or 

ballast materials and removed from the sump of the distillation 
stage is returned--at least partly--directly or 

indirectly to the 
steam drying stage. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that several, preferably 2 or 3, distillation stages are 

used for the laden vapor condensate, the heat of condensation 
from the condensation of the vapor phase in the 

preceding distillation stage being transferred to the 
following distillation stage by heat exchange. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that pressures reduced in stages are applied in the  

 
successive distillation stages. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that the first distillation stage is operated at normal 

pressure and a second distillation stage is operated at 
moderately reduced pressure, preferably with a reduction in 

the boiling temperature of the water of no more than 20°C 
and preferably no more than 10°C. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that evaporation of the vapor condensate in the distillation-based 

purification is carried out in a single stage 
and/or as fractional multistage distillation. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that the vapor stream to be disposed of emanates from 

the drying with superheated steam of useful materials or 
mixtures of useful materials which are suitable for use as 

and/or in wetting agents, detergents and/or cleaning 
products. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 13, characterized 
in that the vapor stream to be disposed of emanates from 

the drying with superheated steam of an environment-polluting 
water-containing material, for example from the drying 

and/or agglomeration of toxic materials, such as pesticides, 
herbicides and other toxic materials and/or waste 

solid at room temperature or from the drying of strong-smelling 
materials, such as sewage sludges, more particularly 

anaerobic sewage sludges, or animal feces. 
The use of the process claimed in claims 1 to 14 for 
the recovery of dried useful materials and mixtures of 

useful materials, which are suitable for use as and/or in 
wetting agents, detergents and/or cleaning products, from 

water-containing preparations thereof in the substantial 
absence of waste gases and polluted wastewaters by drying 

with superheated steam.
