<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for managing the flow of messages in a ring network in which the data are dispatched consecutively, thus ensuring consistency of the flowing messages. It also relates to an interconnection system for implementing this method. This system includes a plurality of processors (P0,...Pn) connected up to a ring network each by means of a cell (C0,..., Cn) providing for the sending and receiving of the messages flowing in the ring, of a reception module (R0,..., Rn) capable of memorising the messages addressed to the processor and of a send module (E0, ..., En) capable of memorising the messages to be dispatched over the network. Application to signal processing, to image processing and to image synthesis.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the control of messages circulating in a
ring network of elementary processors (Po, ..., Pn) organized

in accordance with a parallel structure and able to process,
per cycle, messages of the same size, each of these processors

being connected to the network by means of an interconnection
module, 
characterized in that
 a question of priorities of
interconnection modules for transmission and for reception

of messages is established by tfie circulation of tokens in
the network and 
in that
 one size of messages (TMESS) to be
transmitted on the network is specified prior to the first

transmission, said process comprising:

when an interconnection module receives a token, said
interconnection module receives and acknowledges a first

data item of the message circulating in the network if said
message is intended for the elementary processor with which

it is associated;
the interconnection module checks if it has sufficient
memory space for storing the entire message:


if the memory space is inadequate, the interconnection module
returns the message to the network,
if the memory space is adequate, it stores the first data
item of the message and then all the successive data items

until it detects an end of the message;
if the elementary processor has a message to be sent,
it checks that the interconnection module has an adequate

memory space for completely storing the message to be sent: 

if at least one message has been stored, the interconnection
module supplies the first data item of said message to the

network and then all the successive data items of the message;
if no message has been stored, the interconnection module waits
until it receives a following token.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
, prior
to the first transmission of messages on the network, each elementary

processor transmits a token if it verifies the equations:

(NPE modulo TMESS)=0

and

(N-NPE) â‰¥ TMESS

with NPE between 0 and N-1 and in which TMESS is the size of the
messages to be transmitted, NPE is an elementary processor number

in the network and N is the total number of elementary processors
connected to the network.
Interconnection system implementing the process according to
either of the claims 1 and 2 comprising:


a plurality of elementary processors (PO, ..., Pn) able to
perform asynchronous processing operations, organized in accordance

with a parallel structure and communicating with one another in a
synchronous manner; and
a plurality of interconnection modules, each interconnection
module being associated with an elementary processor in order to

ensure the connection of said elementary processor to the network,
characterized in that
 each interconnection module comprises: 

a cell (CO, ..., Cn) connected to the cells of adjacent
processors and ensuring, when a token is present, on the

one hand the reception of the first data item of the message
circulating in the network and intended for the elementary

processor with which it is associated and on the.other hand
the transmission of the message which the processor wishes to

send to the network;
a reception module (RO, ..., Rn) connected between the
cell and the elementary processor and ensuring the storage

of complete messages received by the cell and intended for the
elementary processor;
a transmission module (E0, ..., En) connected between the
elementary processor and the cell and ensuring the storage of

complete messages which the elementary processor wishes to send
to the network.
System according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 each
transmission module incorporates a memory able to store each

of the messages to be transmitted and a logic circuit able to
determine whether the memory is empty or not, full or not.
System according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 each
reception module incorporates a memory able to store each of the

messages received and a logic circuit able to determine whether
the memory is full or not, empty or not,
Interconnection system according to any one of the claims 3
to 5, 
characterized in that
 it incorporates a central control module
(MC) directly connected to each of the cells of the network in

order to manage the sequencing of the network. 
Interconnection system according to any one of the claims
3 to 5, 
characterized in that
 it incorporates a central control
module (MC) connected to each
 of the cells and connected to the
network by means of a supplementary cell, which initializes

tokens at the start of a cycle.
Interconnection system for the processing of medium level
images according to any one of the claims 3 to 7, 
characterized
in that
 an original of the processed image is allocated to each
processor.
