<ABSTRACT>
A heme polymerase is described. The polymerase is critical in the biology of malaria. By using this novel polymerase, assays useful in developing anti-malaria drugs are made possible. Beyond providing a key for future drug studies and biochemical characterizations, treatments for malaria including quinoline-resistant malarias are made possible. Further, by employing polymerase-inhibiting techniques, such as polymerase inactivation or by offering an alternative substrate, significant breakthrough malaria treatment, prophylaxis and research are made possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Heme Polymerase and Method for Treating Malaria"The invention described herein was made in the course of work under Grant No. Al 30660-01 from the National Institute of Health. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.Background of the InventionThroughout this application various additional publications are referenced and citations are provided in parentheses for them. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.Malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium. of which four species are known to infect humans: P. falciparum. P. vivax. . ovale and P. malariae. Infection is transmitted by female mosquitos of the genus Anopheles when, during a blood-meal, parasites are inoculated by the insect into a susceptible human host. Malaria transmission is indigenous in approximately 102 countries of the world and about 2.7 billion people (i.e., greater than 50% of the world's population) live in areas endemic for the disease. Although accurate evaluation of the global frequency of clinical malaria is made difficult by under-detection and under-reporting, the total incidence may be in the order of 100 million cases a year (statistics from WHO annual report, WHO Technical Report Series, 805, "Practical Chemotherapy of Malaria," WHO Geneva (1990) and New York Times, "Outwitted by Malaria, Desperate Doctors Seek New Remedies" Cl (February 12, 1991)). Malaria remains, despite considerable research and control efforts, the most prevalent and devastating parasitic disease of the tropics with global incidence of human malaria increasing during the past 20 years to an estimated 270-i- 

 million infected people and a staggering 2 million deaths per year.Problems of controlling malaria are appreciated by private, national, and international health organizations, and presently, two main approaches are employed to combat the disease: the first based on empirical drug screening and the second based on vaccines. As is widely conceded, neither approach will make a significant impact on the control of malaria before the disease expands its current proportions. Moreover, there is a consensus among workers in the field that new chemotherapeutic approaches will only emerge following fundamental studies on the biochemistry of the parasite. With limited funding available and the lack of a substantial biochemical and molecular biological
