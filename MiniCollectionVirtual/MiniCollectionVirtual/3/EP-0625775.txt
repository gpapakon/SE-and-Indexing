<ABSTRACT>
A speech recognition apparatus and method output a recognition 
signal corresponding to a command model having the 

best match score for a current sound if the best match 
score for the current sound is better than a recognition 

threshold score for the current sound. The recognition 
threshold comprises a first confidence score if the best 

match score for a prior sound was better than a recognition 
threshold for that prior sound. The recognition threshold 

comprises a second confidence score better than the first 
confidence score if the best match score for a prior sound 

was worse than the recognition threshold for that prior 
sound. In one embodiment, the recognition threshold for 

the current sound comprises the first confidence score (a1) 
if the match score for the prior sound and the acoustic 

silence model is better than a silence match threshold, and 
if the prior sound has a duration exceeding a silence duration 

threshold, or (a2) if the match score for the prior 
sound and the acoustic silence model is better than the 

silence match threshold, and if the prior sound has a duration 
less than the silence duration threshold, and if the 

best match score for the next prior sound and an acoustic 
command model was better than a recognition threshold for 

that next prior sound, or (a3) if the match score for the 
prior sound and the acoustic silence model is worse than 

the silence match threshold, and if the best match score 
for the prior sound and an acoustic command model was 

better than a recognition threshold for that prior sound. 
The recognition threshold for the current sound comprises 

the second confidence score better than the first confidence 
score (b1) if the match score for the prior sound and 

the acoustic silence model is better than the silence match 
threshold, and if the prior sound has a duration less than 

the silence duration threshold, and if the best match score 
for the next prior sound and an acoustic command model was 

worse than the recognition threshold for that next prior 
sound, or (b2) if the match score for the prior sound and  

 
the acoustic silence model is worse than the silence match 

threshold, and if the best match score for the prior sound 
and an acoustic command model was worse than the recognition 

threshold for that prior sound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to computer speech recognition, particularly
to the recognition of spoken computer commands.
When a spoken command is recognized, the computer performs
one or more functions associated with the command.In general, a speech recognition apparatus consists of an
acoustic processor and a stored set of acoustic models.
The acoustic processor measures sound features of an utterance.
Each acoustic model represents the acoustic features
of an utterance of one or more words associated with the
model. The sound features of the utterance are compared to
each acoustic model to produce a match score. The match
score for an utterance and an acoustic model is an estimate
of the closeness of the sound features of the utterance to
the acoustic model.The word or words associated with the acoustic model having
the best match score may be selected as the recognition
result. Alternatively, the acoustic match score may be
combined with other match scores, such as additional
acoustic match scores and language model match scores. The
word or words associated with the acoustic model or models
having the best combined match score may be selected as the
recognition result.For command and control applications, the speech recognition
apparatus preferably recognizes an uttered command,
and the computer system then immediately executes the
command to perform a function associated with the recognized
command. For this purpose, the command associated 
with the acoustic model having the best match score may be
selected as the recognition result.A serious problem with such systems, however, is that
inadvertent sounds such as coughs, sighs, or spoken words not
intended for recognition can be misrecognized as valid
commands. The computer system then immediately executes the
misrecognized commands to perform the associated functions
with unintended consequences.US-A-4,239,936 discloses a speech recognition system in which
ambient noise intensity is measured in parallel to the input
speech signals, with any recognition result assigned to the
input speech signal being rejected when the intensity of the
noise exceeds a predetermined standard value.It is an object of the invention to provide a speech
recognition apparatus and method which has a high likelihood
of rejecting acoustic matches to inadvertent sounds or words
spoken but not intended for the speech recognizer.It is another object of the invention to provide a speech
recognition apparatus and method which identifies the acoustic
model which is best matched to a
