<ABSTRACT>
An optically isolated N-channel MOSFET driver (10) turns on 
a MOSFET device (72) in response to an optical input signal to 

drive a load (74). The turn-on time of the MOSFET is enhanced by 
a current boost circuit (34). As the MOSFET transcends to an on 

state and delivers current to the load, the voltage across the 
device diminishes and causes the current boost circuit to become 

inactive thus reducing to zero the current drain consumed by the 
current boost circuit. A photovoltaic array (40) maintains the 

MOSFET operation. An optically isolated SCR (66) is respondent 
to the absence of a light signal to turn off the MOSFET. 

Furthermore, the optical decoupling of the SCR, between the gate 
and source of the MOSFET device, is arranged to provide enhanced 

noise immunity. A voltage clamping circuit (70) coupled between 
the gate and source of the MOSFET device provides additional 

protection to the device from large over voltages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to MOSFET drivers 
and, more particularly, to an optically isolated N-channel MOSFET 
driver. The use of semiconductors in the domain of industrial 
controls is well established. MOSFET devices used to drive 
industrial loads must supply large amounts of current to the load, 
must be capable of withstanding large over-voltage spikes from 
the load, and must operate at a large supply voltage. To operate 
in such a hostile environment, the MOSFET device must be large in 
geometry. As a result, the gate capacitance of the MOSFET is 
correspondingly large and provides an obstacle to efficiently 
switching the output state of the device. In many applications, microprocessors are used as control 
circuits to MOSFET drivers in order to enhance the controllability 
of the load. Microprocessors typically operate at supply voltages 
of 5 volts or less and are therefore very susceptible to noise and 
extraneous voltage spikes created in a high voltage control 
circuit environment. Optical coupling methods have been used to isolate the input 
of MOSFET drivers from the microprocessor output in an effort to 
prevent communication of unwanted disturbances therebetween. 
Typically, the MOSFET driver input includes a photovoltaic array 
of photosensitive diodes serially connected and driven by a light 
emitting diode that is controlled by a microprocessor. While a 
degree of isolation has been achieved, it is well known that the 
on-switching time of the MOSFET device becomes highly 
dependent upon the voltage generating characteristics of the 
photovoltaic array. To extract a large charging voltage from the 
photovoltaic array, a large number of series connected 
photosensitive diodes is required. As a consequence, the 
effective array capacitance increases and degrades the 
performance of the on-switching time of the device.  A complete industrial control circuit also must have the 
capability of switching to an off state in an efficient manner 
while maintaining good noise immunity characteristics. Typical 
turn off circuits that have been used in the past incorporate an 
active device, such as a bipolar transistor whose collector-emitter 
is connected across the gate-source of the MOSFET 
device. The base of the bipolar transistor is coupled through a 
resistor to the gate of the MOSFET. A photosensitive diode is 
connected across the base-emitter junction of the bipolar 
transistor. The turn off circuit is activated upon removal of a 
light emitting source. As one skilled
