<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein are a heat resistant insulated wire 
which is not decomposed but maintains insulativity under a 

high temperature with excellent adhesion of a coating 
film, and a method of preparing the same. The heat 

resistant insulated wire includes a base material (1) 
consisting of an electrical conductor, and an insulating 

layer (2) provided on its surface. The insulating layer 
(2) is obtained by heating a second polymer, in which main 

chains expressed in a chemical formula - [Si(R₁)₂ - 
N(R₂)]
n
 - are cross-linked with each other by 
chloroborazine through side chains containing 

trialkylsilyl radicals at a temperature of at least about 
300°C and not more than 500°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat resistant 
insulated wire and a method of preparing the same, and 
more particularly, it relates to a heat resistant 
insulated wire having excellent heat resistance which is 
applied to a solenoid, a transformer or a motor used in a 
high vacuum or under a high temperature, and a method of 
preparing the same. A heat resistant insulated wire may be applied to 
equipment such as heating equipment or a fire alarm, which 
must have safety under a high temperature. The heat 
resistant insulated wire is also employed under 
environment in an automobile, which is heated to a high 
temperature. Such a heat resistant insulated wire 
generally comprises a conductor which is coated with heat 
resistant organic resin such as polyimide, polyamideimide, 
PEEK, fluororesin, PPS, aramid or polymaleimide, for 
example. Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-7685 (1986) 
discloses a heat resistant insulated wire which is  
 
prepared by coating a conductor with an unmolten inorganic 
substance and an organic binder. After the organic resin 
is heated and thermally decomposed, ceramics still remains 
in this wire to maintain its insulativity. However, the heat resistant organic resin which is 
employed for coating such a conventional heat resistant 
insulated wire cannot sufficiently withstand a high 
temperature. For example, even the polyimide Upylex (product of 
Ube Industries, Ltd.) which is regarded as withstanding 
the highest temperature among heat resistant organic resin 
products can merely withstand 270°C at the most, and most 
of heat resistant organic resin products cannot be used 
under temperatures exceeding 250°C. In a heat resistant insulated wire comprising a 
conductor which is coated with an unmolten inorganic 
substance and an organic binder as disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 57-12248 (1982), the organic binder 
is thermally decomposed and inorganic powder remains when 
the wire is used under a temperature exceeding the 
withstand temperature of the organic binder. After such 
decomposition, the coating film is in a porous state and 
its adhesion is reduced as compared with that in the 
initial stage, while fallout of the coating film is 
observed. When the organic binder is decomposed, further,  
 
a gas which is mainly composed of hydrocarbon may be 
generated to catch fire. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, an 
object of the present invention is to provide a heat 
resistant insulated wire which is not decomposed but 
maintains
