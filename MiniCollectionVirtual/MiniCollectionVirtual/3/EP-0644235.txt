<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sulfur cured 
rubber composition particularly suited for use in tire 

treads and carcass ply compounds. The sulfur cured 
rubber composition is composed of, based on 100 parts 

by weight of rubber, from about 5 to 95 parts by 
weight of epoxidized rubber; from about 5 to 85 parts 

of a silica filler; from about 0.5 to 8.5 parts by 
weight of a silica coupling agent; and 95 to 5 parts 

by weight of a rubber selected from the group 
consisting of medium vinyl polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene 

rubber, synthetic cis-1,4-polyisoprene, 
synthetic 3,4-polyisoprene, natural rubber, cis-polybutadiene, 

styrene-isoprene rubber, styrene-isoprene-butadiene 
rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene 

rubber and mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tire having a rubber
component containing a rubber compound reinforced with
silica. In one embodiment, the tread is comprised of
a rubber compound containing an epoxidized natural
rubber component, at least one other rubber and a
quantitative amount of silica.Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally
prepared with a rubber tread which can be a blend of
various rubbers which is typically reinforced with
carbon black.In one aspect, rubbers are evaluated, selected
and blended for a purpose of achieving desired tire
tread properties and particularly a balance of tire
tread characteristic properties, mainly, rolling
resistance, traction and wear.For various applications utilizing rubber
including applications such as tires and particularly
tire treads, sulfur cured rubber is utilized which
contains substantial amounts of reinforcing filler(s).
Carbon black is commonly used for such purpose and
normally provides or enhances good physical properties
for the sulfur cured rubber. Particulate silica is
also sometimes used for such purpose, particularly
when the silica is used in conjunction with a coupling
agent. In some cases, a combination of silica and
carbon black is utilized for reinforcing fillers for
various rubber products, including treads for tires.It is important to appreciate that,
conventionally, carbon black is considered to be a
more effective reinforcing filler for rubber tire 
compositions than silica. However certain combinations
of silica and coupling agents in the presence of carbon
black have shown excellent reinforcement similar to
carbon black alone.US-A- 4,621,121 and 4,673,741 which correspond to
EP-A- 178 444 disclose the use of silica in epoxidized
natural rubber, natural rubber, isoprene rubber, styrenebutadiene
rubber, isobutylene isoprene rubber, ethylenepropyleneterpolymer
rubber, nitrile rubber, halogen
containing rubber and mixtures thereof.Other U.S. patents relating to silicas and silica
reinforced tire treads include US-A- 3,451,458;
3,664,403; 3,768,537; 3,884,285; 3,938,574; 4,482,663;
4,590,052; 5,089,554 and GE-A-1,424,503.The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire as
defined in the claims. As known to those skilled in the art, epoxidized
natural rubber is a modified form of natural rubber in
which some of the unsaturation is replaced by epoxidized
groups. Epoxidized natural rubber which is used in
the present invention has a level of epoxidized
modification ranging from 15 to 85 mole percent.
Preferably, the epoxidized level will be in
