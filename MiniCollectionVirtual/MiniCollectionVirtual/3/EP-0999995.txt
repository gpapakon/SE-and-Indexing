<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flow-through beaker which can be filled with a granulate and through which a liquid to be treated can flow. The flow-through beaker has side walls at the ends of which screens are fitted, said screens helping to ensure that the liquid can flow through the granulate inside the flow-through beaker and that the granulate is essentially retained. The aim of the invention is to improve a flow-through beaker of this type so that the in-flowing liquid and at the same time, any escaping gases meet with as little resistance as possible. To this end, at least one screen has a textile fabric (23) wherein plastic fibres (24, 25) of at least two different types are interconnected in order to form a hybrid material, one of the types of plastic fibre (24) containing hydrophilic components and the other type (25) containing hydrophobic components.
