<ABSTRACT>
The buckle of the invention provides a secure and essentially irreversible means for securing parts of the straps, ideally about compressed inbaled material and/or baled material that is prone to shrinkage. The clip (1) comprises a single component that can easily and quickly be applied by hand and associated strapping maybe re-tensioned as appropriate without removing the clip or straps from or about the baled material. The clip is made to rotate about approximately 180 DEG , whereby forces at a resilient nose portion (8A, 8B) of a gripping member (4A, 4B) are caused to clamp down on a part of a strap.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BUCKLEThe invention of this application discloses a novel clip, for use particularly, but not exclusively in baling and/or bundling and a method of securing straps, particularly but not exclusively, about baled material or bundled material or the like.Packaging of material into relatively small bundles or the like is typically referred to as baling. Numerous materials such as fabrics (natural or synthetic), agricultural products, boxed products, waste products or indeed any such material that it is desired to form into discrete and transportable bundles may be the subject of baling. It is known from the prior art to use ropes, straps, bands or the like and to connect ends of said ropes, straps, bands or the like and to join the ends together so as to form a continuous loop about the baled material. Furthermore it is known to use knots or clips or buckles or locks so as to facilitate the joining together of ends of strapping whereby strapping can be tensioned so as to maintain the baled material in a compressed state. In some instances the pressure within the baled material is harnessed so as to enhance the strength of the strapping about the baled material. Notably, baled material, in its compressed state, exerts pressure upon any containment means therefore connection/attachment means that can prevent slipping of the strapping material is important so as to keep the material in a compressed state.However, conventional connection attachments are prone to failure, either by failure of the connection/attachment means itself or failure of the strapping. In the instance of a failure of either component the compressed baled material expands and can escape and scatter. The baled material can therefore be 

damaged in so doing and thus this scenario is potentially inconvenient and hazardous at the site of where the contents spill and/or to somebody transporting said baled material and/or the recipient of the baled goods. Furthermore failure of the components can be costly due to breakages of fragile baled material and the like. It is important economically, and for ease of transport, to compress material into as small a volume as possible so as to reduce transportation costs and to maintain the compressed state of baled material over prolonged periods during storage and/or transportation.Typically, baled material is constrained by multiple straps usually in the region of 6 to 15 crossing straps per bale are used and connection/ attachments means.The strap may be any width that is needed to contain the

CLAIMS
1. A clip comprising an elongate body having two ends and having a turning point therebetween, wherein said body comprises at either end a securing means for securing at least two parts of a strap relative to each other, said securing means comprising a first and second gripping member adapted to accommodate at least one of said two parts of said sfrap therebetween, and wherein a central longitudinal axis of each securing means is positioned substantially parallel to and displaced on opposite sides of a central longitudinal axis of the clip.
2. A clip according to Claim 1 wherein said clip comprises a single component.
3. A clip according to Claims 1 or 2 wherein said clip is provided with at least one access means, whereby said sfrap is threaded through same and about said gripping members.
4. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said clip is constructed from a robust, rust proof, durable material.
5. A clip according to Claim 4 wherein said clip is constructed from plastics.
6. A clip according to Claims 4 or 5 wherein said clip is high pressure injection moulded.
7. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said clip is constructed as a composite of plastics and filled glass fibres. 

8. A clip according to Claim 7 wherein said filled glass fibres are nylon filled or polycarbonate filled.
9. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said clip is provided pre-formed and is attached to and/or associated with at least one end of a pre-determined length of sfrap.
10. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said first and second gripping members are substantially elongate.
11. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein each of said second gripping members are marginally greater in length than each of said first gripping members.
12. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said first gripping member is provided with at least one recess suitably positioned, and of a predetermined length, along at least one side of same.
13. A clip according to Claim 12 wherein said first gripping member is provided with a second recess along a side opposite said at least one side.
14. A clip according to Claim 13 wherein said recesses are of equal length and are positioned at a first end of said gripping member wherein said end is a nearest end to said turning point.
15. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said first gripping member is of differential cross-sectional thickness along its length, a thickest cross-section being at an end remote from said turning point.
16. A clip according to Claims 13-15 wherein said first gripping member comprises a nose portion substantially positioned between said recesses. 

17. A clip according to Claim 16 wherein said nose portion is resilient.
18. A clip according to Claims 16 or 17 wherein said nose portion is curved at an edge near said turning point.
19. A clip according to claims 16-18 wherein said nose portion is made from a different material to said gripping member.
20. A clip according to any preceding claim wherein said second gripping member is of substantially even cross-sectional area along its length.
21. A clip according to Claim 20 wherein said second gripping means comprises a curved end, said curved end being at an end nearest said turning point.
22. Use of a clip according to any preceding claim in baling compressed material.
23. Use of a clip according to any preceding claim in baling material that is prone to natural shrinkage over a period of time and/or as a result of specific conditions.
24. A method of securing two parts of a sfrap relative to each other about in baled material comprising;

ii) inserting an end of a strap a selected distance into an access portion of said elongate body of said clip; 


 iii) threading said strap between and about at least one of said gripping members;
iv) repeating steps ii) and iii) at the other end of said elongate body where appropriate, using the same or an alternative sfrap;
v) applying suitable, substantially equal and opposite tension to selected end(s) of said sfrap so as to reach and overcome a turning moment, rotating said clip by approximately 180° whereby said strap(s) is/are further wrapped about said securing means and a clamping force is applied to said strap(s).

i) placing at least a part of one sfrap means about at least a part of material that is to be baled, and providing at least one clip in accordance with the invention;
ii) inserting an end of a sfrap, a selected distance into an access portion of said elongate body of said clip;
