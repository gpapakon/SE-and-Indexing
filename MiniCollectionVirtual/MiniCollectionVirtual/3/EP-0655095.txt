<ABSTRACT>
A new textile material, a so-called woven knitted fabric, contains weft threads (4) inserted in the knitted fabric in the direction of the stitch rows and/or warp threads (3) inserted in the direction of the stitch wales. Both weft and warp threads are individually inserted in a controlled manner. The material is characterised in particular by an arbitrarily selected beginning and end of individual weft or warp threads within the material, so that a broad spectrum of patterns can be obtained and locally defined property requirements can be complied with. Materials such as wires, coated yarns, micro-fibres, which in pure knitted fabrics can only be used within limits or cannot be at all used, may also be used for the weft and warp threads (3, 4). The weft and warp threads may also be mutually linked by woven links or may also be partially formed into loops. Woven knitted fabrics are particularly advantageous for the production of three-dimensionally shaped textile articles.

wire or flock yarn, without or with at least one 
additional thread of a normal kind. 
Textile material according to one of claims 1 to 
6,
 
characterised in that
 
in at least one course at least two weft 

threads are present, which either with different 
guiding run parallel from the starting point to 

the end of the weft insertion, or only over a 
portion of a weft insertion with or without 

overlapping. 
Textile material according to one of claims 1 to 
7,
  
 

characterised in that
 
in at least one wale at least two warp threads are 

present which either with different guiding run 
parallel from the starting point to the end of the 

warp insertion or only over a portion of a warp 
insertion with or without overlapping. 
Textile material according to one of claims 1 to 
8,
 
characterised in that
 
in the interlacing of at least one weft thread at 

least one loop is divided into two loops. 
Textile material according to one of claims 1 to 
9,
 
characterised in that at least one edge is 

present, in which at least two weft threads 
overlap and run partially in the edge, or in which 

at least one weft thread runs transversely to it. 
Three-dimensionally shaped textile article made 
from the textile material according to one of 

claims 1 to 10,
 
characterised in that
 
at least one edge is present, in which at least 

one warp thread begins or ends and/or partially 
runs in the edge, or in which at least one warp 

runs continuously transversely to it.  
 
Textile article made from the material according 
to one of claims 1 to 11,
 
characterised in that
 
in at least one place a certain number of warp 

threads and/or weft threads, or just one of them, 
are guided in such a way that, over a certain 

distance, they are not bound into the fabric 
structure and form a tab. 
Textile article according to claim 12,
 
characterised in that
 
the weft or warp threads which form a tab 

are connected by means of at least one warp or 
weft thread in a weave. 
Method of manufacturing a knitted fabric with at 
least one weft and/or warp thread worked in 

additionally, and individually as selected, i.e. 
one thread running in the direction of the course 

or the interlooping, which is not sunk in over at 
least one loop width/loop length, on a knitting 

machine with at least one individually 
controllable warp and/or weft thread carrier, 

which is provided with a clamping/cutting device, 
with the following steps in the manufacturing 

process: 

The weft and/or warp thread is introduced by the  
 

weft and/or warp thread guide, which can be 
individually controlled as the material is 

interlooped into the knitted fabric; 
a weft or warp thread, guided on a corresponding 
yarn carrier is introduced into the knitted fabric 

at a desired place by the clamping/cutting device; 
and 
by clamping and cutting the weft or warp thread, 
the thread insertion is ended at a desired other 

part of the knitted fabric.
