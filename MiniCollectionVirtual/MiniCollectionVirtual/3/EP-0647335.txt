<ABSTRACT>
Electronic control apparatus of a kind used in low voltage industrial equipment such as assemblies of motors or circuit breakers. Where an overall controller, e.g. a programmable logic controller (PLC) controls an array of (e.g.) motors (M1, M2, M3) by way of respective control units (13, 23, 33) identification or location of selected motors is usually effected by an address stored in the respective control unit. A faulty control unit entails replacement and loss of the location address which has to be re-entered as a skilled operation. The invention provides a separate non-volatile memory (15, 25, 35) for the location address, this memory being physically associated with the particular motor (M1 etc.). A replacement control unit (13, 23, 33) is automatically loaded with the location address which was retained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic control apparatus, and
particularly, but not exclusively, to programmable electronic
industrial control and protection apparatus.Such control and protection apparatus may be, for example,
in the form of a control unit or a system incorporating such control
units for industrial low voltage control gear. The system may
typically have motor control centres for the grouped control of a.c.
machines in a voltage range of say 380-660V, or the system may have
control units for the control of fixed speed d.c. machines in the
range of say 110-300V. Such control and protection apparatus within
the scope of this invention may also be for other installed
equipment, such as low voltage air circuit breakers.Such known programmable electronic industrial control and
protection apparatus which includes control units associated on a
one to one basis with individual items of installed equipment
(motors, distribution panels etc) commonly contains the parameters
specific to that equipment locally in onboard software memory
incorporated in the control apparatus . This means that when that
electronic control apparatus fails and a replacement is installed 
there is a significant chance of the parameters being entered
incorrectly. Even where that equipment can have its parameters
entered remotely via a serial link its unique address still needs to
be set up locally.IEC specifications refer to installed equipments mentioned
above of whatever type as functional units. We can conveniently
refer to the programmable electronic industrial control and
protection apparatus described above of whatever type, and
associated with each such functional unit, as a control unit. Thus
where a number of functional units are at different locations, each
having a control unit associated with the specific functional unit
at its unique location, and the functional units are all linked to a
programmable logic controller or are all linked in a computer system
then the first essential information for correct operation of the
functional units is that the correct address of each functional unit
is held at its location. As mentioned above each such location
address of a functional unit has hitherto been held in software in
the associated control unit; and furthermore it has been necessary
for a skilled person to be present at that location to input the
correct address into the control unit software. Thus when a control
unit fails at a particular location and it is replaced by a new
control unit, it has needed a skilled
