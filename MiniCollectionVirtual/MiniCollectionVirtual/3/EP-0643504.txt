<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a threshold detector for a receiver of a system for transmitting digital signals in a transmission channel, especially to mobile units, comprising means (21) for calculating a set of coefficients fn (24) belonging to the group containing, on the one hand, a set of coefficients cn (24) of correlation between a first series of digital samples received xn by the said receiver and a second series of digital samples with reference Pn known to the said receiver, for searching for the synchronisation of the said system, and, on the other hand

 of an estimate of the pulse response of the said transmission channel, when the said system is already synchronised, and moreover comprising means (25) for calculating a decision variable A such that:
