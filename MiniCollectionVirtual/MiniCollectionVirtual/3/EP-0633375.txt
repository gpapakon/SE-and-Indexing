<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a magnetically controlled locking apparatus, consisting of a key and of a cylinder (barrel), the said cylinder having a longitudinal axis and including a stator and a rotor defining between them an interface. The rotor can be made to rotate by the key about the said longitudinal axis of the cylinder. The apparatus comprises magnets provided in the region of the key which interact with other magnets which can move within the cylinder.   According to the invention, the magnets of the key and of the cylinder are gripped within sheaths made of ferromagnetic metal. What is more, the magnets of the cylinder are designed to slide in the region of the interface, in holes formed in the stator and/or in holes formed in the rotor, so as to lock the rotation of the said rotor. The magnets of the cylinder and those of the key are located with the same geometric distribution and are magnetically identical in pairs.

rotated by the key (14, 114) about the said longitudinal axis (40, 140) of the 
cylinder, the said device including magnets (16, 116) provided at the key (14, 

114) co-operating with other magnets (21, 121) mobile in the cylinder, 
characterised by the fact that, on one hand, the said magnets (16, 116) of the 

key (14, 114) and the said magnets (21, 121) of the cylinder (1, 101) are 
enclosed in sockets (22, 122) of ferromagnetic material and that, on the other 

hand, the said magnets (21, 121) of the cylinder are designed so as to slide at 
the interface (41, 141), in holes (20, 120) provided in the stator (11, 111) 

and/or in holes (26, 126) provided in the rotor (12, 112), in such a way as to 
lock the said rotor (12, 112) rotationally, the said magnets (21, 121) of the 

cylinder and those of the key being arranged with the same geometrical 
distribution and being magnetically identical two by two. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
sockets (22, 122) of ferromagnetic metal are constituted by a non-magnetic 

sleeve (42, 142) and a yoke (43, 143) of ferromagnetic material, capable of 
concentrating the magnetic flux in a given direction to increase the precision 

of the coding. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that the said 
magnets (16, 116) of the key (14, 114) and the said magnets (21, 121) of the 

cylinder (1, 101) have magnetic axes (44, 144) the directions of which are 
parallel to the axis (40, 140) of the cylinder when the device is being 

manipulated. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised by the fact that the holes 
(20, 120) in the stator are provided with compression springs (24, 124) on the 

side opposite from the key (14, 114), capable of pushing back the magnets  
 

(21, 121) of the cylinder (1, 101) in locked position, while the holes (26, 126) 
of the rotor are closed on the side facing the key (14, 114). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised by the fact that the 
sockets of ferromagnetic metal (22, 122) in which the magnets are enclosed 

are open on the front face side of the key (14, 114), in the case of the magnets 
(16, 116) of the key, and on the rear end side of the rotor (12, 112), in that of 

the magnets (21, 121) of the cylinder (1, 101). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised by the fact that 
mechanical coupling means, of any known type, are provided in the outer face 

of the rear end of the rotor (12, 112) and on the front face of the key (14, 114).
