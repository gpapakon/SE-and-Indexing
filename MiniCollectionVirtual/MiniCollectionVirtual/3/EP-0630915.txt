<ABSTRACT>
A process comprising contacting a mixture comprising 
ethylene, propylene, and, optionally, a diene, under polymerization 

conditions, with a catalyst system comprising: 

(a) a catalyst precursor, in independent or prepolymer form, 
consisting of vanadium (acetylacetonate)₃; 
(b) optionally, a support for said precursor; 
(c) a cocatalyst consisting of a trialkylaluminum; and 
(d) a promoter, which is a saturated or an unsaturated 
aliphatic halocarbon having at least 3 carbon atoms and at least 6 

halogen atoms or a haloalkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbon 
wherein the haloalkyl substituent has at least 3 halogen atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ethylene/propylene copolymer 
rubbers (EPRs), which include ethylene/propylene copolymers 
(EPMs) and ethylene/propylene/ethylidene norbornene terpolymers 
(EPDMs), generally having a crystalline content of less than about 
15 percent by weight, and a process for their production. The EPRs are elastomeric copolymers and terpolymers used 
in such applications as hose and tubing, wire and cable, gaskets, 
and single ply roofing. They are usually formulated with fillers, oils, 
processing aids, and stabilizing agents, and cured by reacting the 
polymers with sulfur in the presence of accelerators or with a 
combination of sulfur and an organic peroxide such as dicumyl 
peroxide. These polymers are presently manufactured commercially 
in solution and slurry processes with soluble vanadium catalysts. 
The processes are very expensive to run, requiring solvent removal 
and steam stripping steps. In addition, these solution catalysts do 
not provide satisfactory particle morphology in a fluidized bed. 
Improvement in these processes would be desirable and, 
particularly, the development of a gas phase process to produce 
these same products would be more economically attractive because 
little post-reaction cost will be incurred. One of the catalysts selected to produce the EPRs in the gas 
phase is described in United States patent 4,508,842. This catalyst 
is one of several conventional catalysts useful for the production of 
polyethylene, and it would be commercially advantageous to have a 
catalyst, which, not only can be utilized in the production of 
polyethylenes having good properties, but can also be used 
successfully for the production of EPRs.  Typically, the catalyst described in the above-mentioned 
United States patent, is comprised of a catalyst precursor, which is 
the reaction product of vanadium trichloride and an electron donor, 
the precursor being reacted with an aluminum containing modifier, 
and impregnated into a silica support; a promoter such as 
chloroform; and a triisobutylaluminum cocatalyst. This catalyst 
does achieve good particle morphology, but poor overall product, e.g., 
EPRs made with this catalyst exhibit poor cure and contain much 
high temperature crystallinity. This is believed to be the result of 
poorly distributed propylene, and, in the case of the EPDMs, poorly 
distributed diene. Adjustments with respect to the cocatalyst and 
the promoter were found to improve the propylene distribution and 
lower the high temperature crystallinity, but
