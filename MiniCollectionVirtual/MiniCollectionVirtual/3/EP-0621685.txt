<ABSTRACT>
An RF amplifier (PA) for amplifying TDMA signals in base stations has a control circuit (CC) which controls a change in the signal level variation (SL) of an RF signal (Pin Pout) by time intervals in that it evaluates the actual signal level variation of the RF signal in each case differently in a number of part-zones (AT, GT) of the respective interval (T1-[k]). The RF amplifier advantageously controls differently, for example during a first part-zone (GT) in which the signal level changes from one level step to the next, than during a second part-zone (AT) in which the signal level constantly maintains one level step. Temporary storage of correction values provides for stable and "off-line" control.

<CLAIMS>
An RF amplifier (PA) for controlling the level
characteristic (SL) of an RF signal (Pin, Pout)

divided into successive time intervals (T1, T2, ...,
T8), particularly of a TDMA radio signal, comprising a

control circuit (CC) which evaluates the actual-level
characteristic of the RF signal (Pout) differently

within two or more subintervals (GT, AT) of the
respective time interval (T1, T2), in each of which a

particular desired-level characteristic is
predefined,
characterized in

that the control circuit (CC) does not evaluate the
actual-level characteristic within a first subinterval

(GT), for which a dynamic desired-level characteristic
is predefined, and evaluates the actual-level

characteristic within a second subinterval (AT), for
which a constant desired-level characteristic is

predefined, by determining a constancy error value
(AE) by means of a desired-value/actual-value

comparison.
An RF amplifier (PA) as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the control circuit (CC) is preceded

by a low-pass filter (LF) which smoothes the actual-level
characteristic within the second subinterval

(AT) and makes the former available for determining
the constancy error value (AE).
An RF amplifier (PA) as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the control circuit is a

processor-controlled digital circuit (CC) which
determines an actual average value from the actual-level

characteristic within the second subinterval
(AT), and evaluates said actual average value to

determine the constancy error value (AE).
An RF amplifier (PA) as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that the control circuit is a
processor-controlled digital circuit (CC) which uses

the determined constancy error value (AE) of
the respective time interval (T2[k]
) to control the
constant desired-level characteristic within a

subsequent time interval (T2[k+1]), and which uses the

determined constancy error values of two successive
time intervals (Tl[k]
, T2[k]) to control the dynamic

desired-level characteristic within a subsequent time
interval (T2[k+1]
) in order to adapt the transition
from one signal level to the next.
An RF amplifier (PA) as claimed in claim 4 for the
power-controlled amplification of a TDMA radio signal

consisting of frames (k-1, k, k+1, ...) each
comprising a number of time intervals (T1[k]
, T2[k], ...,

T8[k]),

characterized in that the processor-controlled digital
circuit (CC) calculates control values from the

constancy error values (AE) determined within a frame
(k), stores said control values temporarily in a frame

memory (FMEM), and uses them to control the desired-level
characteristic within one of the subsequent

frames (k+1) if the desired-level characteristics in
the two frames (k, k+1) are predefined at least

approximately equally. 
An RF amplifier (PA) as claimed in claim 4,

characterized in that on the first occurrence of a
signal-level transition, the processor-controlled

digital circuit (CC) calculates dynamics control
values for adapting the dynamic, first subinterval

(GT; T2[k+1]) to the adjoining constant, second

subintervals (AT; T1[k+1], T2[k+1]
) according to a cos
2

curve, stores said dynamics control values in an
initialization memory (IMEM), and, if said signal-level

transition occurs again, uses them to control
the dynamic desired-level characteristic within a

subsequent first subinterval (GT).
A radio transmitter comprising an RF amplifier (PA)
for controlling the level characteristic (SL) of an RF

signal (Pin, Pout) divided into successive time
intervals (T1, T2, ..., T8), particularly of a TDMA

radio signal, and comprising a control circuit (CC)
which evaluates the actual-level characteristic of the

RF signal (Pout) differently within two or more
subintervals (GT, AT) of the respective time interval

(T1, T2), in each of which a particular desired-level
characteristic is predefined,
characterized in

that the control circuit (CC) does not evaluate the
actual-level characteristic in the respective time

interval (Tl[k]; T2[k]
) within a first subinterval
(GT), in which a dynamic desired-level characteristic

is predefined, and evaluates the actual-level
characteristic within a second subinterval (AT), in

which a constant desired-level characteristic is
predefined, by determining a constancy error value

(AE) by means of a desired-value/actual-value
comparison.
