<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet head is disclosed for use with a drop-on 
demand type printer, and includes an insulating base (240,242), a 

plurality 
of elongated barriers (245) projecting upwardly from the base so as to 

form a plurality of slots (202) between the barriers, a plurality of 
nozzle holes (203) communicating with the slots, and electrodes formed 

on the side walls of the elongated barriers. Voltage can be 
applied to the various barriers through the electrodes in order 

to cause deflection of the barriers and a corresponding reduction 
in the cross-sectional area of selected slots, so as to force ink 

contained in the slots to be jetted through the nozzle holes. In 
order to provide a uniform ink jet intensity from the outermost 

slots relative to the inner slots, dummy slots can be formed 
outwardly of the outermost active slots by providing dummy 

barriers outwardly of the outermost active barriers. In addition, 
the nozzle holes are formed in a nozzle plate. The nozzle plate 

can either be mounted against the ends of the slots, or atop the 
base. When mounted atop the base, possible breakage of the ends 

of the barriers is less of a problem. Further, the plurality of 
barriers can either be mounted to the base by an
 adhesive, or can 
be formed integrally with the base. The ink jet head is 

formed with two bases (240,242), one atop the other, and the barriers 
of the bases may be polarized in opposite directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet printer 
head for a drop-on demand (DOD) type printer. Among non-impact type printers, ink jet printers have 
recently become quite popular, due, in large part, to the fact 
that they operate on a relatively simple principle and are 
suitable for use in color printing. Of the non-impact type 
printers, continuous ink jet type printers were first developed, 
with DOD type printers being more recently developed. Such DOD 
type printers do not continuously jet ink, but rather jet ink 
only when it is necessary to form a dot. Currently, these DOD 
type printers are more popular than the continuous ink jet type 
printers. A typical DOD type printer is a kizer type printer such 
as that disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 12138/1978. 
However, such kizer DOD type printers are burdened by the fact 
that they are quite difficult to miniaturize. Another typical DOD type printer is a thermal jet type 
such as that disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 59914/1986. However, such thermal jet type printers are burdened by 
the fact that the ink used therein must be heated to a relatively 
high temperature, thus resulting in burning and sticking of the 
ink. Accordingly, as disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open 
No. 252750/1988, a shear mode type DOD printer has been developed 
in order to overcome the above-noted problems confronting these 
typical DOD type printers. The construction and principles of 
operation of this shear mode type printer will now be described 
with reference to Figures 7-10 and 18.  As best shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), a plurality of 
elongated barriers 95ab, 95bc, and 95cd are bonded onto a base 
105 by an adhesion layer 108 in such a manner as to form narrow 
slots 92a, 92b, and 92c which define ink chambers and flow paths. 
The ink for these narrow slots 92a, 92b and 92c is to be supplied 
from a common ink reservoir 187 defined at first ends of the 
slots 92a, 92b and 92c so as to be in communication, as best seen 
in Figures 10 and 18, with the narrow slots. Second ends of the slots 95 are substantially closed by 
a nozzle plate 100 bonded to the ends of the barriers 95. The 
nozzle plate 100 has a plurality of small nozzle holes 93a-93f 
formed therein in communication with each of the slots 92a-92f, 
respectively. A lid 106 is bonded to upper surfaces of the barriers 
95 by a flexible elastic material 109 in such a manner that the 
barriers 95 are flexible in lateral directions relative to the 
lid 106 (see Fig. 9(b)). The
