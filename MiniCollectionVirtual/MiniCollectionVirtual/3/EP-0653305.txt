<ABSTRACT>
A manufacturing method for manufacturing a 
liquid jet recording head comprises the steps of: 

forming a solid layer (4) having a pattern of a liquid path 
communicating with a discharge port (IIII) through which a 

liquid is discharged on a substrate (1); coating the solid 
layer (4) with a curable material including a micro-capsuled 

curing agent; curing the curable material by 
mixing the micro-capsuled curing agent into a main 

agent of the curable material; and forming a wall of 
the liquid path comprised of the cured curable material 

and the substrate by removing the solid layer (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid jet
(ink jet) recording head of the type of performing the
recording in such a manner as to discharge minute
droplets of the recording liquid, commonly referred to
as the ink, through fine openings, flying them, for
sticking onto the recording face, its manufacturing
method, and a liquid jet recording apparatus having the
recording head.The liquid jet recording head typically
comprises fine recording liquid discharge openings
(orifices), liquid flow paths, and liquid discharge
energy generating elements provided within the liquid
flow paths.Conventionally, a typical method for
fabricating such a liquid jet recording head has been
well-known as disclosed in USP 4,657,631 (Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 61-154947) and USP
5,030,317 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
62-253457), for example, and is described below (see 
Figs. 1A to 1G).First, a photosensitive resin layer 2 (for
example, positive photoresist) is formed on a treated
substrate 1 (see Fig. 1A), exposed to light through a
mask 3 (see Fig. 1B), and then patterned by processing
to form a solid layer on the treated substrate (see
Fig. 1C).Next, a liquid flow path forming material 5 of
the active energy or heat curable type is coated over
the patterned solid layer (see Fig. 1D), and cured by
applying active energy ray or heat to form a liquid
flow path forming member 5a (see Fig. 1F).Further, the patterned solid layer is dissolved
and removed, using an organic solvent such as halogen
containing hydrocarbon, ketone, ester, ether or
alcohol, or an alkaline aqueous solution such as sodium
hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, to form liquid flow
paths 7 (see Fig. 1G).In the above process, to secure principally the
outside dimension of the head, after the liquid flow
path forming material 5 is coated and after a second
substrate 6 such as a glass (see Fig. 1E) is covered,
and the material 5 is cured to form an ink jet
recording head.In the manufacturing method of the ink jet head
as above described, one-liquid curable material is
usually used as the liquid flow path forming material. It is generally said that one-liquid curable
material of the type of already containing a curing
agent before curing to start curing with the action of
active energy or heat is more excellent in the uniform
dispersion of the curing agent in the material, and in
the uniformity of the degree of curing, than two-liquid
curable material of the type of not containing a curing
agent before curing but only mixing the curing
