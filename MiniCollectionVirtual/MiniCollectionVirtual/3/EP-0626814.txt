<ABSTRACT>
Footwear wherein the footwear is provided with a sole which is made at least partly with an intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP), wherein the ICP is based on either polyaniline, polydiphenylamine, polypyrrole, polythioprene, polythiophene, polythienylenevinylene, bithiophene or polycroconaine dosed with iodine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the earthing of electrostatic charges on a 
person in a safe and convenient way by means of footwear. It is an 
accepted scientific fact that friction caused by movement between 
insulating materials will result in the generation of electro-static 
charges. These charges may cause a voltage build-up of many 
thousands of volts. Because of their inherent insulating properties, 
the increasing use of synthetic fibres and materials is presenting 
increasing danger risks and discomfort problems due to the build-up 
of electro-static voltages. It has been established that static electricity can be reduced by 
applying an anti-static finish to materials and by wearing footwear 
with anti-static soles. It should be noted, however, that anti-static 
finish on materials is effective when they are new, but its 
effectiveness will become less after washing and pressing. One danger associated with static-electricity is that of explosion and 
fire from ignition of flammable vapour or gas, however, there is also 
a growing awareness of the personal discomfort problem associated 
with electro-static voltages. Simply, every day examples of the discomfort of static "shock" are 
as follows:  
 
1. Persons can receive a shock when getting out of a motor 
vehicle by sliding over the plastic seat and earthing 
themselves on the metal door handle or bodywork of the 
vehicle. 2. An unexpected static shock is often experienced when 
touching door handles and lift buttons after walking on 
synthetic carpets. Other means of causing a build-up of an electro-static charge on 
persons are: 
1. The wearing and taking off of synthetic clothing. 2. When getting up from a chair which is covered in a plastic or 
synthetic material. 3. Nurses in hospitals often become "charged" when making 
beds. Natural fibres, such as wool, cotton etc cannot become statically 
"charged" due to their inherent moisture content and 
make-up, and their continuing ability to both absorb and retain 
moisture.  
 Conversely, silk and synthetic fibres are well-known for their ability 
to generate and accumulate electro-static charges. This is often 
demonstrated by the "crackling" or "sparkling" that occurs when 
removing synthetic clothing. This increasing use of synthetic fibres and materials, such as nylon, 
orlon, polyester, etc. and plastics generally, in clothing, carpets 
furnishings, upholstery and soles on footwear, is presenting 
increasing discomfort and safety risks to the community and industry 
around the world. Static
