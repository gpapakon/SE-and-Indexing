<ABSTRACT>
Hot metal is circulated by R-H unit (28) in a closed loop path through first and second hearths (10 and 11) and chambers (12, 14, 16 and 18). Titaniferous material containing iron oxide is introduced into first hearth (10) and the iron oxide therein is reduced in a heating zone in the first hearth (10) to iron to produce titania slag having a reduced iron content which is removed in chamber (12) before the hot metal passes via an underflow weir (22) into chamber (14) at which coal is added and a proportion of the hot metal is removed. The addition of coal is such that more than 2 % by weight of carbon dissolves in the hot metal in the second hearth (11). Coal ash slag is removed at chamber (16), whilst the hot metal containing the dissolved carbon is recirculated to the first hearth (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of 
synthetic rutile of a quality suitable for use as a 
feedstock in the production of TiO2 pigment via the 
chloride route. The chloride route to TiO2 pigment production has 
become increasingly important in view of environmental 
concerns about the acid wastes produced by the sulphate 
TiO2 process which can accept lower grade titaniferous 
ores. Commercial synthetic rutile production for use as 
a feedstock in the chloride route is normally based on 
ilmenite feedstock containing 54 to 60% TiO2, with a 
distinct preference for material of at least 58% TiO2 
content. Various proposals have previously been made for 
processing lower grade titaniferous materials as 
alternative sources of TiO2 pigment. For example, a 
process has been used which involves blending ilmenite 
with coke and smelting in an electric arc furnace to 
separate most of the iron as saleable pig iron and to 
form a titania-enriched slag. Enrichment of the TiO2 content of conventional 
titanium slags has also been disclosed by dc arc 
smelting. EP-A-0266975 (corresponding to US-A-4701217) 
discloses a method of smelting metal oxide material 
comprising forcibly circulating a molten carrier material 
in a closed loop path serially through a smelting  
 
reduction zone, a slag separation zone and a heating zone; contacting 
the metal oxide material with the molten carrier material; introducing a 
carbonaceous reductant to the molten carrier material; at least partially 
reducing the metal oxide to metal by the carbonaceous reductant in the 
smelting reduction zone, the metal oxide and carbonaceous reductant 
being utilised in proportions such that the carbon from the carbonaceous 
reductant is converted to carbon monoxide; reacting the carbon 
monoxide with oxygen in the heating zone at the surface of the molten 
carrier material so that the heat generated by the reaction is transferred to 
the molten carrier material which is circulated to the smelting reduction 
zone; separating slag from said molten carrier material in said slag 
separation zone before the molten carrier material is circulated to the 
heating zone so that the surface of the molten carrier material which is 
circulated to the heating zone is substantially free of slag; and recovering 
said metal. Amongst a large number of possible feedstocks which are 
described, EP-A-0266975 discloses the application of the above process 
to ilmenite to form titaniferous slag (a source of synthetic rutile) and pig 
iron, but there is no

A method of upgrading titaniferous material containing iron 
oxide, comprising the steps of circulating a molten carrier material 

comprising molten iron and dissolved carbon in a closed loop path 
through first and second hearths (10 and 11); introducing the titaniferous 

material into the carrier material; heating the introduced titaniferous 
material in a heating zone in the first hearth (10) so as to reduce iron 

oxide to iron and produce a titania slag having a lower iron content; 
removing the titania slag from the molten carrier material before the 

latter is circulated to the second hearth (11); introducing carbonaceous 
reductant into the molten carrier material so as to cause carbon to 

dissolve in the carrier material in the second hearth (11); and performing 
a further slag removal operation on the circulating molten carrier material 

before passing the latter to the first hearth (10). 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the amount of 
dissolved carbon in the molten iron contacted by the titaniferous material 

exceeds 2% by weight. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the amount of 
dissolved carbon is 3 to 5% by weight. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the FeO 
content of the titania enriched slag is not more than 5% by weight and 

the titania content is not less than about 90% by weight. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the  
 

titaniferous material is introduced in the form of pellets onto the surface 
of the molten iron containing dissolved carbon. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
molten iron containing dissolved carbon is maintained at a lower 

temperature than the titania in contact therewith. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the titaniferous 
material is introduced so as to form a layer on the molten iron containing 

dissolved carbon and is heated from above after a delay upon 
introduction so as to delay fusion of the titaniferous material. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein a 
proportion of the TiO

 in the titaniferous material is reduced to Ti
2
O

during reduction of the iron oxide to iron so that the titania slag contains 

a proportion of Ti

O

, such slag is passed to a slag reservoir, and the 
Ti

O

 is oxidised to TiO
2
 so that sufficient heat is released in the slag 
reservoir to fuse any remaining solid rutile phase in the slag before the 

slag product is removed. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the carbonaceous 
reductant is introduced into the carrier material by establishing a 

relatively stationary layer of the carbonaceous reductant on the carrier 
material and causing the carrier material to flow under such layer 

whereby to pick up carbon from such layer of reductant.
