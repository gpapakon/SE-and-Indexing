<ABSTRACT>
A data transmission system for an automotive 
vehicle includes a plurality of control units installed 

on the vehicle, and a transmission line connecting the 
plurality of control units with each other. The 

transmission line is comprised of a pair of signal 
lines to which digital data signals having opposite 

polarities are delivered for transmission of data. 
Each of the plurality of control units comprises a 

first receiver for receiving both of the digital data 
signals having oppositive polarities and outputting a 

first difference signal indicative of a difference 
between the digital data signals, a second receiver for 

receiving one of the digital data signals and 
outputting a second difference signal indicative of a 

difference between the one of the digital data signals 
and a predetermined reference level set thereto, and a 

third receiver for receiving the other of the digital 
data signals and outputting a third difference signal 

indicative of a difference between the other of the 
digital data signals and a predetermined reference 

level set thereto. Detecting of which of the pair of 
signal lines is faulty, is carried out based on the 

first difference signal output from the first receiver, 
the second difference signal output from the second 

receiver, and the third difference signal output from 
the third receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a data transmission
system for an automotive vehicle, which comprises a
plurality of electronic control units installed on the
vehicle and a common communication line connecting the
electronic control units with each other.Recently, automotive vehicles are electronically
controlled in respect of most part of the engine
control, the suspension control, and so on.
Accordingly, they are each equipped with a data
transmission system for connecting a plurality of
electronic control units (hereinafter referred to as
"the ECU's") for the respective types of control by a
common communication line (hereinafter referred to as
"the network bus") to transmit data necessary for the
above types of control to each other by the use of
asynchronous serial data signals.High reliability is demanded of this type of
data transmission system for automotive vehicles, and
therefore, the system employs a twisted-pair
transmission method in which the network bus is
implemented by a composite signal line formed by a
twisted-pair transmission line having a pair of signal
lines to which a sending end (ECU) delivers digital
data signals having opposite polarities (i.e. being
opposite in phase), respectively, so that a receiving 
end (ECU) can receive a message from the sending end
based on changes in the polarities of the signals
indicative of the logical states of the signals. The
twisted-pair transmission method makes it possible to
transmit data even if one of the pair of signal lines
is disconnected, thereby enhancing reliability of the
system.However, the twisted-pair transmission method is
capable of transmitting data even if one of the twisted
pair is disconnected, for example, as described above.
Therefore, it is neither possible to recognize
occurrence of the fault nor to determine which of them
is faulty due to disconnection, ground fault, or the
like, which prevents the system from recovering from
the fault. Therefore, when the other of the twisted-pair,
which has been safe, becomes faulty, it is
entirely impossible for the system to perform data
transmission.Further, within such a conventional data
transmission system, a receiving end (ECU) is required
to perform synchronization of bit times by making the
phase of a bit time of a serial data signal received
from the network bus and the phase of a bit time within
the receiving end synchronous with each other, as well
as to perform resynchronization by temporarily lengthen
or shorten the bit time within the receiving end to
correct a difference in
