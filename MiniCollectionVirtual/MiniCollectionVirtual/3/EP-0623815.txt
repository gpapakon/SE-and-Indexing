<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting reflection-type discontinuities 
in an optical waveguide fiber, such as those produced by a 

fiber break, a contaminant in the glass making up the 
fiber, a microbend, or a mechanical splice or connector, is 

provided. The method employs an optical time domain 
reflectometer OTDR) and involves cross-correlating an OTDR 

trace or a modified OTDR trace, e.g., one from which fiber 
attenuation has been subtracted, with a predetermined 

waveform which is characteristic of a reflection-type 
discontinuity. The predetermined waveform can compensate 

for differences between the noise spectrum of the OTDR 
trace and white noise. In particular, a predetermined 

waveform obtained by backward differencing and then 
forwarding differencing an average of waveforms known to 

correspond to reflection-type discontinuities is able to 
provide such white noise compensation.

<DESCRIPTION>
Optical waveguide fibers are often tested by means of 
an optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR). This device 
sends a short pulse of laser light down a fiber and 
observes the small fraction of light which is scattered 
back towards the source. Typical pulsewidths may range 
from 0.5 meters (5 ns) to 2000 meters (20 µs). In the past, a method known as the "slope technique" 
has been used to automatically detect reflections in OTDR 
traces, the height of a reflection normally being reported 
as its "ORL" value to eliminate the effect of pulsewidth. 
Specifically, the relationship between reflection height, 
A, and ORL value is given by: 
ORL = B - 10 * LOG [(10(A/5) - 1) * PW]  
where B is the fiber backscattering level and PW is the 
OTDR pulsewidth in ns. In accordance with this method, an 
error array (EA) is calculated by fitting the original 
trace data between fiber start (FS) and fiber end (FE) with 
a straight line using a least squares fitting routine and 
then subtracting that straight line from the original trace 
on a point-by-point basis. The resulting error array is 
then examined and an alarm triggered when a rising slope 
exceeding the predetermined threshold is found. In practice, the threshold level had to be set high 
enough so that random noise events were not falsely labeled 
as reflections. Accordingly, reflections having a height 
less than about 0.06 dB above the background noise could  
 
not be reliably found with this method for long lengths of 
fiber. The use of filters to detect relatively weak signals 
in noise is known in the field of digital signal 
processing. See, John Karl, An Introduction to Digital 
Signal Processing, Academic Press, 1989, pages 217-225. 
Correlation detectors and the whitening of noise is 
discussed in Harry L. Van Trees, Detection, Estimation, and 
Modulation Theory, Part I, John Wiley & Sons, 1968, pages 
246-253 and 287-293. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide an improved method for 
detecting reflection-type discontinuities in optical 
waveguide fibers. More particularly, it is an object of 
the invention to provide an improved method for detecting 
such discontinuities by means of an OTDR. To achieve the foregoing and other objects, the 
invention in accordance with certain of its aspects 
provides a method for detecting reflection-type 
discontinuities in an optical waveguide fiber comprising 
the steps of: 
(a) applying a pulse of light to the optical 
waveguide fiber by means of an OTDR; (b)
