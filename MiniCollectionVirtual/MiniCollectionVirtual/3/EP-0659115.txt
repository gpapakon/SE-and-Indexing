<DESCRIPTION>
 CONDUCTIVE BASE SHEETS UTILIZING CONDUCTIVE BENTONITE CLAYS IN THE FIBER MATRIXBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to conductivized sheets of cellulosic fiber and the process for their manufacture. More particularly, the conductivized sheets, according to the present invention, contain conductive clays that are uniformly dispersed through the cross-sectional thickness of the sheet.In the past, conductive sheet materials, such as conductive paper and conductive packaging, have been rendered conductive by incorporating conductive materials in the sheet material or by coating the sheet with a film of conductive material. However, the conductive materials suitable for use in both types of conductive sheets are limited.In particular, the rheological properties of a conductive filler material to be incorporated into the sheet material must be sufficient to allow thorough or complete dispersion in water. This will allow the requisite amount of conductive filler to be incorporated in the cellulosic pulp, yielding a sheet material of sufficient conductivity. In the past, various types of conductive materials have been utilized as fillers in conductive sheet material.For example, in U.S. Patent No. 2,328,198, finely divided Paris black, otherwise known as carbon black, and finely divided metals are described as being suitable for incorporation in paper. The finely divided carbon black is added to water to form a colloidal solution. This solution is then mixed in a beater with a batch of fibrous stock and beaten until a pulp is formed. Paper sheets are then formed using conventional paper making techniques from the resulting fibrous pulp. See also U.S. Patent No. 3,149,023, wherein carbon or graphite is incorporated into the paper in order to render the sheet conductive. 

 Other conductive fillers have also been incorporated in the fibrous matrix of paper sheets. In U.S. Patent No. 3,062,700, there is disclosed static discharging paper containing conductive white zinc oxide or white titanium dioxide powder. Zeolites have also been employed as conductive fillers. See U.S. Patent No. 3,694,202.Filler retention aids or sizing agents have also been utilized in the manufacture of conductive papers, such as polyacrylamide resins, alum or aluminum sulphate. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 2,328,198. Very small amounts of the retention aids are normally added prior to the sheet forming process. Modified clays have also been used generally as a retention aid. In the case of such clays, the amount of
