<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine includes one or more pistons (4), each of which is mounted to reciprocate in a respective cylinder (2) and is pivotally connected to one end (11) of an elongate link member which is pivotally connected to the associated crank (10) at a point intermediate its ends. The other end of the link member (14) constitutes a rod (18) which is coupled to a first movable mounting member (20) such that relative movement between them is possible only in the direction of the length of the rod (18). The first movable mounting member (20) is connected to a second movable mounting member (26) such that relative motion between them is possible only in rotation about an axis (21). The second movable mounting member (26) is guided to move linearly with respect to a fixed mounting member (24) in a direction transverse to the length of the rod (18) and actuating means (31; 40) cooperate with the second movable mounting member (26) and are arranged to move it linearly. The mounting (20, 26, 24) and the link member (14) are dimensioned and arranged so that the speed of the piston decreases at or around the time at which ignition occurs thereby promoting rapid propagation of the flame front through the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder and the dwell period at the bottom dead centre position of the piston is prolonged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal combustion engines of reciprocating
piston type and is particularly, though not exclusively concerned with engines of
the general type disclosed in EP-A-0591153.This prior document discloses an engine in which the or each piston is caused to
move over at least a portion of the cycle at a rate which is such that the graph of
its displacement against time differs from the sinusoidal shape which is inherently
produced in conventional engines in which each piston is connected to a
respective crank on a crankshaft by a respective connecting rod. In such a
conventional engine attempts are made to match the combustion of the fuel/air
mixture to the motion of the piston but the philosophy underlying the construction
of the prior document is that the combustion is permitted to proceed in the
optimum manner and the piston is caused to move in a manner which "follows"
the combustion and is related to the nature and progress of the combustion
process.More specifically, the prior document discloses an engine in which the piston is
caused to decelerate and thus to move more slowly than in a conventional engine
at or around the point in the cycle at which ignition of the fuel/air mixture occurs
and then to speed up again prior to reaching the top dead centre position (TDC).
This is based on the recognition that in a conventional engine the piston is moving
at substantially its maximum speed at the point at which ignition occurs and the
compression ratio is altering at substantially its maximum rate and thus impedes
the rate of propagation of the flame front through the fuel/air mixture and thus 
impairs the nature and completeness of the combustion process. However,
slowing the piston down at around the ignition point means that the rate of
increase in the pressure of the fuel/air mixture at the time propagation of the flame
front commences is substantially less than is usual which results in the flame front
propagating through the fuel/air mixture very much more rapidly than as usual.The prior document also discloses that the piston is caused to reach its maximum
acceleration and maximum speed at something between 0 and 40° after TDC,
instead of 90° after TDC as in a conventional engine, and thereafter to move more
slowly than in a conventional engine in the latter portion of its working stroke
prior to reaching the bottom dead centre position (BDC). This results in a
decreased temperature of the exhaust gases and thus in reduced emissions of NOx
and reduced erosion of the

An internal combustion engine including one or more pistons (4), each of
which is mounted to reciprocate in a respective cylinder (2) and is pivotally

connected to a connecting rod (6) which is connected to a respective crank (10) on
a crankshaft (7), the connecting rod (6) being pivotally connected to one end (11)

of an elongate link member (14) which is pivotably connected to the associated
crank (10) at a point intermediate its ends and whose other end constitutes a rod

(18) which is restrained by a mounting (20, 26, 24) such that it may pivot about a
pivotal axis (21) parallel to the axis (8) of the crankshaft (7), the mounting

mounting member (24), and a second movable mounting member (26), the first

movable mounting member (20) being connected to the rod (18) by a connection
which permits only relative sliding movement in the direction of the rod (18) and
