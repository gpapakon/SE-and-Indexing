<ABSTRACT>
For realizing more accurately a signal separation of 
a luminance signal and a chrominance signal, a signal 

separation automatic adjusting circuit in a YC separation 
comb filter includes an amplitude adjusting loop for 

detecting a level of a color signal component remaining in 
the separated luminance signal to adjust amplitudes in an 

image signal and a 1H delayed image signal, a first phase 
adjusting loop for adjusting phases of the image signal and 

the 1H delayed image signal which are respectively inputted 
into an adder, and a second phase adjusting loop for 

adjusting phases of the image signal and the 1H delayed 
image signal in the manner of suppressing the color signal 

remaining in the luminance signal. According to the 
constitution, it is possible to prevent an intermix of the 

color signal component into the luminance, thereby obtaining 
the YC separation automatic adjusting circuit having 

a high accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a YC separation 
circuit for separating a luminance (Y) signal and a chrominance 
(C) signal from image signals by means of a comb 
filter, and more specifically, to a YC separation automatic 
adjusting circuit having a function for automatically 
adjusting a signal separation. There is described first a conventional YC separation 
circuit in reference with FIG. 1 showing an example of a 
so-called comb filter. The comb filter uses characteristics 
of carrier color signals in which a phase is inverted 
by 180 degrees each horizontal scanning so as to separate 
a luminance signal and a chrominance signal on the basis 
of the sum and difference of two signals having a time 
difference corresponding to one horizontal scanning time 
(1H). In this example, a level of a delay image signal is 
adjusted in the manner that amplitudes of two image signals 
are equal to each other, and a shift amount of phase of the 
delay image signal is adjusted in the manner that the phase 
difference between two image signals becomes an exact 1H. 
By adding with such adjusting, chrominance signals are 
interposed with the same amplitude and the phase difference 
of 180 degrees each other at an addition and subtraction 
of two image signals, namely, the luminance signal is 
separated by the addition and the chrominance signal is 
separated by the subtraction. In detail, in FIG. 1, an image signal is supplied to 
an input terminal 1 from a tuner or a video tape recorder 
(not shown). The image signal is delayed for a time 
corresponding to one horizontal scanning time by means of 
a delay element 5 for delaying a signal such as a charge 
coupled device (abbreviated in a CCD hereafter) and the 
like so as to be a delayed image signal which is supplied 
through a variable gain circuit 6 and a variable phase  
 
shift circuit 7 to each one of input terminals of a 
subtracter 10 and an adder 11, respectively. There is 
supplied the image signal which is not passed through the 
delay element 5, to each of the other input terminals of 
the subtracter 10 and the adder 11, respectively. The 
subtracter 10 subtracts the delayed image signal from the 
image signal both of which phases of respective chrominance 
signals are different from 180 degrees each other, thereby 
offsetting a luminance signal component to output a 
chrominance signal to an output terminal 2. The adder 11 
adds the delayed image signal with the image signal both 
of which phases of respective chrominance signals are 
different from
