A pallet for the transport of loads, comprising pallet 
elements of uniform construction made of sheet metal, wherein 

the pallet elements each have, at least in their edge regions, 
at least two conical projections formed downwards in the sheet 

metal which correspond in shape and size, characterised in 
that at least two pallet elements (1) are disposed side by 

side with edge overlap, wherein the conical projections (2) of 
the upper pallet element engage in the conical projections of 

the lower pallet element in the region of overlap and fix the 
position of the pallet elements (1) in relation to each other. 
A pallet according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
pallet elements (1) each have nine conical projections (2) 

which are arranged in three rows each comprising three 
projections disposed side by side. 
A pallet according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the conical projections formed in the sheet metal have a 

height which corresponds to the standard height for stacker 
loading. 
A pallet according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the conical projections (2) have 

openings (3) on their undersides for the detachable fastening 
of sheet metal strips (4), the width of which is slightly  

 
greater than the width or the diameter of the conical 

projections (2) and the length of which corresponds to the 
total length or the total width of the pallet. 
A pallet according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
sheet metal strips (4) have integrally formed projections (5) 

which are slightly arched outwards and which engage with a 
locking action in the associated openings (3) of the conical 

projections (2). 
A pallet according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the pallet elements have stiffening 

creases (6) formed downwards in the sheet metal. 
A pallet according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by wedge-shaped attachments (7) having pegs on 

their undersides matched to the conical projections (2), 
wherein the wedge-shaped attachments (7) can be attached to 

the pallet on opposite edges thereof.
