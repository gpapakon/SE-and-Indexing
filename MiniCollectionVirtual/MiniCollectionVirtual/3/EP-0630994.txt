<ABSTRACT>
A process for synthesizing a large-area single crystal of diamond which is uniform and has a good quality 
readily at a low cost, which process comprises dispersing diamond particles in a metal and melt-recrystallizing the 

metal matrix, thereby orienting the particles in one and the same crystalline direction to form a substrate equivalent 
to a single-crystal diamond substrate, and growing a single crystal of diamond thereon according to the vapor-phase 

synthesis process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for a vapor phase
synthesis of diamond, particularly to a method for a vapor phase
synthesis of a high-quality diamond crystal used for a cutting tool, an
abrasion resistant tool, a precision tool, a semiconductor material, an
electronic part, an optical part and the like.Since diamond has various excellent properties such as a
high hardness, a high thermal conductivity and a good transparency, it
is widely used as a material for various tools, an optical part, a
semiconductor and an electronic part. The importance of the diamond
seems to increase in feature.In particular, when, among the above applications of the
diamond, the diamond is used for a very precision tool, an optical part
and a semiconductor in which a smooth abraded surface is needed or a
highest level of the optical transparency or thermal conductivity is
required, then a single crystal diamond or a diamond simple substance
having a high crystal orientation must be used.Hitherto, although a diamond film having a relatively large
area has been artificially prepared on various substrates by a vapor
phase synthesis, such diamond film is a polycrystal and a single crystal
diamond film having a large area has not been prepared yet. Conditions
for the epitaxial growth of the single crystal using the vapor phase
synthesis have been studied and a method for preparing the single 
crystal having the large area by the vapor phase synthesis has been
studied.It has been known for a long time that a single crystal
diamond layer can relatively easily grow through a homoepitaxial
growth by using a diamond single crystal as a substrate in the diamond
vapor phase synthesis. However, since a large diamond single crystal
substrate which can act as a seed crystal has not been obtained, this
method can give a single crystal having only a diameter of several
millimeters. Various methods for the vapor phase synthesis have been
proposed, since the vapor phase synthesis can easily give a
homoepitaxial layer having a large area on the substrate if only a single
crystal substrate having a large area is available.Methods for growing the single crystal diamond having the
large area by the vapor phase synthesis are generally classified into
two classes of methods. The first class of methods utilizes a
heteroepitaxial growth. Namely, the first class of methods is intended
to give the single crystal having the large area by epitaxially growing
the diamond layer on the single crystal substrate of a material which
can give the
