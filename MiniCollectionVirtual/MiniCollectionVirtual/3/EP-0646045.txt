<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phosphorus/vanadium
oxide catalysts useful in a process for the oxidation of
hydrocarbons to dicarboxylic acid anhydrides, and more
particularly to a high surface area catalyst of improved
microstructure which provides high yields in such a
process. The invention is also directed to a method for
the preparation of the catalyst.Numerous catalysts containing vanadium,
phosphorus and oxygen (sometimes referred to as mixed
oxides of vanadium and phosphorus), substantially in the
form of vanadyl pyrophosphate, optionally containing a
promoter component, are disclosed in the prior art as
being useful for the conversion of various hydrocarbon
feed stocks to maleic anhydride. In general, such
catalysts wherein the valence of the vanadium is less
than +5, usually between about +3.8 and about +4.8, are
considered particularly well suited for the production of
maleic anhydride from hydrocarbons having at least four
carbon atoms in a straight chain (or cyclic structure).
Typically, such catalysts also contain promoter elements
or components which are considered to be present in the
catalyst as oxides. Common organic feed stocks include
non-aromatic hydrocarbons such as n-butane, 1- and
2-butenes, 1,3-butadiene, or mixtures thereof.Generally, such catalysts are prepared by
contacting vanadium-containing compounds,
phosphorus-containing compounds, and promoter
component-containing compounds (when a promoter element 
is desired) under conditions sufficient to reduce
pentavalent vanadium to the tetravalent state and form
the desired catalyst precursor comprising vanadyl
hydrogen phosphate, optionally containing a promoter
component. The catalyst precursor is thereafter
recovered, typically in particulate form, and subjected
to a variety of further conventional processing
techniques to produce the active catalyst. An essential
step in such further processing is calcination. Prior to
calcination, the catalyst is typically formed into a
shaped body such as tablet or pellet by compression in a
die. A lubricant is ordinarily incorporated in the
precursor composition to facilitate the tableting or
pelletizing process.In its final form, the catalyst comprises a
mass of porous tablets or pellets which are charged in
bulk to provide the catalyst bed of a fixed bed reactor.
Typically, the catalyst is charged to a tubular reactor
comprising the tubes of a shell and tube heat exchanger.
Hydrocarbon and oxygen are fed to the tubes, and a heat
transfer fluid, such as molten salt, is circulated
through the
