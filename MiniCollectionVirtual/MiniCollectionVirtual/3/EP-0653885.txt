<ABSTRACT>
The video server (VS) is used in a video on demand network 
wherein video signals are transferred over a communication 

network (TSY) from said video server to terminals thereof. It 
includes video signal memories (VM), a server control means 

(SCM), a broadband switch (BS) having first ports (VP1/VPY) 
to which the memories (VM) are coupled, second ports (CL) 

coupled to the communication system (TSY) and a third port 
(CP) to which the server control means (SCM) is coupled. The 

server control means (SCM) control the transfer of the video 
signals from the memories (VM) and through the switch (BS) 

and the communication system (TSY) to the terminals. The 
broadband switch (BS) has a set of fourth ports (CP1/CPX) to 

which a set of system adaptor means (SYA1/SYAX) is coupled to 
adapt the video signals to a format which is compatible with 

the communication system. The server control means (SCM) 
performs the transfer of video signals firstly from the video 

memories (VM) to the system adaptor means (SYA1/SYAX) through 
the switch (BS) and then from the adaptor means to the 

terminals via the communication system (TSY). The system 
adaptor means include channel memories and adaptors to 

perform rate and format adaption of the video signals 
respectively. The channel memories and the adaptors can be 

directly and separately coupled to the broadband switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a video server for 
use in a video on demand network wherein video signals are 
transferred over a communication network from said video 
server to terminals of said communication system, said video 
server including video signal memories, a server control 
means, a broadband switch having first ports to which said 
memories are coupled, second ports coupled to said 
communication system and a third port to which said server 
control means is coupled, said server control means 
controlling the transfer of said video signals from said 
memories and through said switch and communication system to 
said terminals. Such a video server is for instance known from the 
article "A system architecture for a large scale video on 
demand service", by W. Sincoskie, Computer Networks and ISDN 
Systems 22, 1991, pp. 155 - 162. Therein the video memories 
comprise the "library", "copier memories" and "stop/start 
buffers". Although not described in the article, it is clear 
that for a correct operation system adaptor means have to be 
provided in order to adapt the video signals stored in the 
memories to a format compatible with the communication system 
and to provide them at a real time rate as needed for the 
terminals. Indeed, the server has to provide video signals in 
real time and in a broadband format, e.g. an ATM or an SDH 
format, although the video signals are stored in the video 
memories in a way which is independent from this broadband 
format and read therefrom at speeds that are higher than real 
time. As a result of the described architecture these 
adaptor means have to be located at the outputs of the above 
memories and consequently their number has to be proportional 
to the number of video memories, and thus also of the number  
 
of available video signals, and this irrespective of the 
demand, i.e. of the number of adaptor means already in use. In other words, when calling the resources , e.g. 
the adaptor means, needed to supply the specific video 
signals to a terminal, video channels, it is clear that the 
known video server has to allocate a number of video channels 
proportional to the number of video signals and this 
irrespective of the demand for these video signals. Normally, 
the number of video signals available can be much larger than 
the number of requested video signals or channel signals 
which may be supplied simultaneously. Hence it is clear that 
in the known server an excess number of video channels is 
allocated, which results in a waste of
