<ABSTRACT>
A soundproof type water-cooled engine generator is 
constructed to guide an exhaust current of air from a 

cooling fan of a water-cooled engine to an independent 
hood-like shroud chamber, deaden the current sound through 

a muffler located under the shroud chamber, for improving 
the cooling performance. A water-cooled engine 2 and a 

generator 3 are accommodated in a soundproof bonnet 1. A 
panel wall 8 is provided close to a fan 7 equipped in the 

water-cooled engine. The panel wall serves to partition 
the soundproof bonnet 1 into an engine and generator 

chamber 11 and an exhaust processing chamber 12. The panel 
wall has a hole having the substantially same diameter as 

the fan 7. Around the outside of the hole, a shroud 
chamber 17 is independently provided in the exhaust 

processing chamber. The shroud chamber 17 is formed by a 
hood-like encircling wall 14. On the lateral side of the 

shroud chamber, a radiator 13 is located to stand upright. 
A muffler is located under an exhaust duct chamber 18 so 

that the exhaust is discharged from the upper portion of 
the exhaust duct chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soundproof type 
water-cooled engine generator which provides such a 
low-noise structure as improving soundproof performance and 
cooling efficiency. The conventional cooling structure for this kind of 
soundproof type water-cooled engine generator, as shown in 
Fig. 3, includes a water-cooled engine 41, a generator 42, 
and a soundproof bonnet 43. The water-cooled engine 41 is 
directly connected to the generator 42 so that they keep 
their axes aligned. The water-cooled engine 41 and the 
generator 42 are accommodated in the soundproof bonnet 43. 
Air inlets 44, 44, 44 are formed on the side wall of the 
bonnet 43. Those inlets are located close to the generator 
accommodated in the soundproof bonnet 43. On the opposite 
side of the water-cooled engine 41 to the generator 42, an 
engine fan 45 is supported on a shaft contained in the 
water-cooled engine 41 so that the engine fan 45 is rotated 
by the engine 41. As opposed to the engine fan 45, a 
radiator 46 is located. The engine fan 45 is surrounded by 
an encircling wall 47. In operation, the engine fan 45 is driven to take air, 
that is, cooling air from the air inlets 44 to the 
soundproof bonnet 43. The cooling air is taken inside to 
cool the generator 42, the water-cooled engine 41, and then 
the other units such as a battery and a control unit. 
Then, the air is introduced to an exhaust duct 48 for 
cooling a muffler located upwardly of the exhaust duct 48. 
The air is then discharged outside through an exhaust 
outlet 50. The exhaust duct 48 is formed by partitioning 
the soundproof bonnet 43 from the shroud chamber where the 
water-cooled engine 41, the generator 42 and the control 
unit are held.  
 Further, another soundproofing and cooling technique 
has been provided. In this technique, a shroud chamber is 
independently provided in the exhaust duct 48. A radiator 
is slopewise located in the front lower portion of a 
cooling fan provided in the shroud chamber so that the 
engine fan is spaced from the radiator by a predetermined 
interval for diminishing a current noise occurring in this 
radiator. In the foregoing structure where the radiator is 
located as opposed to the engine fan, the engine fan is 
located close to the radiator. Hence, the current noise 
caused when the cooling current of air given by the engine 
fan passes through a radiator core is made so large that 
the noise is guided out of the exhaust outlet through the 
exhaust duct. The noise guided outside sounds as a large 
uncomforta
