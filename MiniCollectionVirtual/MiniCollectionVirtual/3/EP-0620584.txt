<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (
40
) for providing consistent, non-jamming registration of a notched 
semiconductor wafer (
46
) undergoing multiple sequential process work includes a plate 
(
41
) upon which the wafer (
46
) is laid flat. The notch (
45
) of the notched semiconductor 
wafer (
46
) is registered against a first roller (
42
) that is fixedly mounted to the plate (
41
). 
A second roller (
43
), also fixedly mounted to the plate (
41
), registers a first point (
47
) 
along the circumference of the wafer (
46
). A third roller (
48
) is fixedly mounted to a 
bracket (
50
) that is movable approximately along the radius of the wafer (
46
). A force 
(
52
) is applied to this bracket (
50
) resulting in the third roller (
48
) applying a force 
against the wafer (
46
). This resultant force, coupled with the rotating capability of the 
rollers (
42,43,48
), allows the wafer (
46
) to rotate into a proper registration position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the registration of 
semiconductor wafers undergoing multiple sequential 
processes, such as a metrology step followed by a thinning 
and/or etching processes and, in particular, relates to an 
apparatus that provides consistent, non-jamming 
registration of notched semiconductor wafers in order to 
correlate the registration of the semiconductor wafers 
throughout the multiple sequential processes. US-A-4 820 930 discloses a positioning device for 
positioning a mask having formed thereon a pattern to be 
transferred onto a semiconductor wafer. On the basis of a 
peripheral shape of the mask, the positioning device 
positions the mask so that a center of the mask is brought 
into alignment with a center of rotation of a holder for 
holding the mask. The positioning device includes a 
plurality of engaging pins to be engaged by the periphery 
of the marks, each engaging pin being movable in a 
direction towared the center of rotation of the mask 
holder. Movement of each of the engaging pins is controlled 
independently from the others, whereby the mask can be 
positioned irrespective of its size and/or shape.  
 The process of measuring the thickness of an outer material layer of a 
semiconductor wafer is known as wafer surface metrology. During such a wafer surface 
metrology process, a semiconductor wafer is mechanically registered to the stage of a 
thickness measuring instrument. This instrument generates a map that indicates the 
thickness of an outer material layer of the wafer over an entire surface of the wafer. The 
outer layer thickness map generated from this metrology process is often used in other 
processes that thin or etch the material of the outer layer of the wafer to a desired 
thickness or in a desired location, respectively. These outer layer thinning and etching 
processes both include some type of tool that is directed onto the surface of the wafer. 
This tool must be properly positioned along the wafer surface to ensure that the thinning 
or etching process is performed at the correct location on the wafer surface. To ensure 
this proper wafer registration, an accurate correlation between the outer layer thickness 
map and the position of the wafer with respect to the thinning or etching tool is required.  
 For semiconductor wafers having flats, a current approach for correlating an outer 
layer thickness map with the position of the wafer in a thinning or etching instrument 
begins by marking the wafer with a set of alignment fiducials during
