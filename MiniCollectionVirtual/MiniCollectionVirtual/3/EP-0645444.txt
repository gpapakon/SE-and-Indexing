<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns lubricants containing specific 
detergent additives. More particularly, overbased detergents 
having linear mono- and/or dialkyl substitution provide lubricants 
with superior water shedding and engine performance. During the combustion process in internal combustion 
engines, mineral and organic acidic by-products are produced. 
At the same time, other acidic products can also be generated 
by the degradation of lubricants used in internal combustion 
engines during engine operation. Such products attack and 
corrode engine parts leading to high temperature deposits on 
engine parts and low temperature sludge formation, resulting 
in increased wear of lubricated engine components. Basic 
substances are typically added to lubricants to neutralize the 
acidic products to avoid sludge formation and engine 
corrosion. Overbased detergents are basic compounds which have been 
added to lubricant compositions to neutralize acidic degradation 
products. Overbased detergents are generally salts or 
complexes having a large excess of basic metal cation over 
that required to neutralize the oil-soluble anionic component 
of the detergent. Lubricants containing overbased detergent 
suitable for use in marine diesel engines are disclosed in 
US-A-4,283,294 (Clarke). Lubricants, like those used in marine diesel engines, 
require high levels of alkalinity, typically obtained using 
high concentrations of overbased detergents. Overbased 
detergents can have surfactant characteristics. Lubricant 
compositions containing high concentrations of such compounds 
will emulsify with water, generally found in marine applications.  
 
This emulsification reduces the ability of the 
lubricant composition to separate from water, known as "water 
shedding" or "water spitting". Diminished water shedding 
properties result in difficulties to remove water. The 
presence of water can cause additive instability and 
subsequently induce the formation of sludge and loss of 
lubricant. Linear, alkyl aromatic sulfonates have been used 
as emulsifiers, as described in GB-A-2,232,665 (De Montlaur) 
et al.). Another important lubricant characteristic involves its 
effect on engine performance. Engine wear, ring sticking, and 
accumulation of deposits under operating conditions at high 
temperature are important properties influenced by lubricant 
performance. Optimally, lubricants should provide enhanced 
engine performance. Surfactant properties of alkyl benzene sodium sulfonates,
