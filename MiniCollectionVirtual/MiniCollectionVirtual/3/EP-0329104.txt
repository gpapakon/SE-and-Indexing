<ABSTRACT>
For improvement in high frequency response characteristics, 
a noise eliminating circuit (22) incorporated in an image signal 

processor has a delay line (26) coupled between an output node of 
a charge coupled device (21) and a ground node, and an emitter 

follower circuit (27) coupled at the base node thereof to the 
output node the the charge coupled device, and each electric 

image signal supplied from the charge coupled device is reflected 
from the ground node to introduce a delay therein and merged into 

the subsequent electric image signal to produce a noise 
eliminated electric image signal which is supplied to the emitter 

follower circuit, so that the noise eliminated electric image 
signal is amplified by the emitter follower circuit with a 

constant gain, because of a small time constant coupled to the 
base node of the emitter follower circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processor and, more 
particularly, to a noise elimination circuit provided in 
association with a charge coupled device. A charge coupled device is well known as a converter 
operative to convert an optical image into a series of electric 
image signals. The charge coupled device is superior in size, 
weight, power consumption and reliability to the image camera 
tube and is capable of producing the electric image signals which 
are less liable to be influenced by an image distortion and by an 
image printing phenomenon. For these reasons, the charge coupled 
device is superseding the image camera tube in the field of the 
video tape recorder, camcorder as well as of the industrial camera. 
Moreover, since the charge coupled device is improved in the 
image resolution capability depending upon the development in the 
semiconductor manufacturing techniques, the charge coupled device 
is now used as an image sensor incorporated in the high 
resolution broadcasting camera. The development in the semiconductor manufacturing 
techniques is conducive to a minutiarization of the device size 
and to a high density integration, which results in a high  
 
resolution image sensor. However, the smaller in the element 
size, the less in the amount of electric charges for each image 
signal. When the electric charges for the image signal are 
reduced, it is necessary to decrease the amount of electric 
charges due to noise for maintaining the sensitivity and the 
dynamic range. For this reason, research and development efforts 
are made for a noise elimination circuit capable of improving the 
signal-to-noise ratio for a high sensitivity image processor. These efforts are resulted in various noise elimination techniques 
one of which is well known as a delay and differential noise 
elimination technique proposed by Nishida et al of NHK Science 
and Technical Research Laboratories. Fig. 1 shows the image 
processor provided with the noise elimination circuit using the 
delay and differential noise elimination technique 
(See "Noise in a CCD Image Sensor and the new Low-noise Read-out Method", 
Proceedings of the Society of Television, vol. 39, No. 12, 1985, pp 1176 to 1181). The image 
processor largely comprises a charge coupled device 1 and a noise 
elimination circuit 2. The charge coupled device 1 has a photoelectric 
transducing section 3, a driving circuit 4 coupled to 
the transfer port of the photo electric transducing section photo 3, 
and a buffer circuit 5 coupled to the
