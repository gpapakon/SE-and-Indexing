<ABSTRACT>
A plastic pellet delivery system including an extruder 
nozzle having an orifice (41) and an arcuate surface adjacent the 

orifice (41a) and rigid cutting knife (36) which is 
eccentrically mounted (27;e) 

on a shaft that is positioned and is rotated adjacent the orifice 
to move the rigid knife eccentrically into and out of engagement 

with the nozzle surface. The cutting knife is mounted for 
limited yielding pivotal movement relative to the eccentric 

mount such that it will deflect angularly with respect to the 
eccentric mount as it is engaging the nozzle surface such that 

the free edge of the knife blade tip is moved radially inwardly 
as the eccentric mount is rotated providing a substantially 

constant force of the blade against the nozzle surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to plastic pellet delivery
apparatus and methods and particularly to
such apparatus and methods for delivering a
predetermined precise quantity of plastic for use in compression
molding plastic closures and compression molding liners in
plastic closures.In the manufacture of plastic closures by compression
molding and the provision of liners in plastic closures, it is
common to utilize pellet delivery apparatus. Typical patents
showing such apparatus are: 2,640,033, 3,458,897, 3,676,029,
3,828,637, 3,955,605, 4,080,136, 4,157,048, 4,269,584,
4,277,431, 4,440,704, 4,800,792 and 4,978,288.In one type of apparatus which has been used as shown
in United States patents 4,080,136 and 4,277,431, a flexible
and resilient blade is moved along a surface surrounding the
extrusion nozzle and after it moves past the surface snaps to
accelerate the pellet to the place of use. It has been found
that such an apparatus is difficult to set up and requires substantial
attention. Furthermore, it requires frequent adjustment. In
addition, it has limited life and must be replaced rather
frequently.Accordingly among the objectives of the present
invention are to provide a pellet delivery apparatus and method
that are less dependent upon operating skill, need less attention,
utilize 
a construction that has longer life; provide better alignment
of a cutting knife blade with respect to the extrusion orifice,
and provide for better control and placement of the pellet.In accordance with the invention a pellet delivery
apparatus and method are provided, the apparatus
including an extruder nozzle having an orifice
and an arcuate surface adjacent the orifice and rigid cutting
knife which is eccentrically mounted on a shaft that is positioned
and is rotated adjacent the orifice to move the rigid knife
eccentrically into and out of engagement with the nozzle surface.
The cutting knife is mounted for limited yielding pivotal
movement relative to the eccentric such that it will deflect
angularly with respect to the eccentric mount as it is engaging
the nozzle surface such that the free edge of the knife blade
tip is moved radially inwardly as the eccentric mount is rotated
providing a substantially constant force of the blade against
the nozzle surface. FIG. 1. is an elevational view of a pellet delivery
apparatus embodying the invention.FIG. 2 is a part sectional plan view thereof.FIG. 3 is a part sectional end view thereof.FIG. 4 is a fragmentary part sectional partly

cutting blade (36) in a direction corresponding to the
direction of rotation of said shaft (27) such that when

said shaft is rotated, said surface (41a) is engaged by
the free edge (36a) of the cutting blade, the cutting

blade (36) is deflected angularly with respect to said
shaft (27) in the direction opposite to the direction of

rotation and the free edge (36a) moves radially inwardly
to conform to the arcuate cylindrical surface (41a) and

sever a pellet from the extrudate.
The apparatus set forth in claim 1,

   wherein said nozzle block (40) includes a
substantially tangential surface (41b) in advance of

said orifice (41) that is engaged by the free edge (36a) 
of the blade (36) as it is moved toward and across the

orifice.
The apparatus set forth in claims 1 or 2,

   wherein said means for mounting said cutting blade
(36) on said shaft includes a blade holder (30) mounted

eccentrically on said shaft (27), a slot (35a) in said
blade holder engaged by said cutting blade (36) and

spring means (38, 50) interposed between said blade
holder (30) and said cutting blade (36).
The apparatus as set forth in claim 1,

comprising a cutter assembly (20) including the
