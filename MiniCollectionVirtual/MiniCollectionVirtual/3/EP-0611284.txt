<ABSTRACT>
A rocking or swinging chair comprising a stationary frame (14), a seat element (20) supported by a seat frame (12) and a support (18) wherein the support (18) is pivotally connected to and accommodated within the frame (14) and the seat element (20) is pivotally connected to a lower end (26) of the support (18) so as to be capable of reciprocating movement relative to the frame (14) and further comprising armrests (22) pivotally connected at an upper end (28) of the support, said armrests (22) being capable of reciprocating movement relative to the frame in the respective opposite direction to the seat element (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHAIRJf The present invention relates to a chair and more5 particularly, but not exclusively, to a rocking or ' swinging chair.Rocking chairs are well known, many people find them comfortable to sit in and the rocking motion relaxing.Two main types of rocking or swinging chair have been10 previously proposed. A first type, or "rocking chair", can consist of a chair body incorporating one or more arcuate foot members resting on the ground, or on a supporting frame, upon which the chair body can rock forwards and backwards. It can also consist of a chair15 body linked to a supporting frame by a pivot on either side usually at the rear of the chair which enables the chair body to rock forwards or backwards about the pivot.A second type is most common in garden furniture where the seat itself is suspended from elevated portions of a20 fixed frame so that it is capable of swinging or pendulous motion. For example:-GB 456 227 - The Crown Bedding Company Ltd - discloses a swinging garden seat in a stationary frame.The seat is suspended at each end on the fixed frame by25 pairs of parallel straps which maintain the seat in a horizontal position as it swings.GB 470702 - vaughan - discloses a swinging settee in which the seat and back support are suspended from a stationary frame by means of parallel links at each end.30 The frame also incorporates cross-rods which extend between the sides of the seat and a central longitudinal. member of the frame to prevent side swing.Both rocking and swinging chairs have disadvantages* which can combine to make them unsuitable for elderly or35 disabled people who are frail and/or have difficulties in 

 sitting down in or getting out of a chair which moves freely. The very fact that the seats are not fixed can make them difficult to get into and out of and the traditional rocking chair requires significant arm/leg muscular effort to initiate the rocking motion. The swinging chair, whilst requiring less effort to initiate motion, relies almost entirely on the legs to obtain movement. The swing-type chairs have the general disadvantage of being usually large and cumbersome whilst the rocking-type chairs have also the disadvantage that during forward rocking motion the seat tips forwards and downwards. Often, with such rocking-type chairs, the arcuate feet protrude beyond the front and/or back of the chair, being a hazard particularly for elderly or disabled people and young children. In addition, the arcuate rocking-type chair, where there is no fixed base, can move when

CLAIMS :
1. A chair comprising a stationary frame (14) , a seat frame (12) and a support (18) wherein the support (18) is pivotally connected to the stationary frame (14) and the seat frame (12) is pivotally connected to one end (26) of the support (18) so as to be capable of reciprocating movement relative to the stationary frame (14) and further comprises armrests (22) pivotally connected at a second end (28) of the support (18) , said armrests (22) being capable of reciprocating movement relative to the stationary frame (14) in the respective opposite direction to the seat frame (12) .
2. A chair as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the support comprises at least two elongate elements (24) which are pivotally mounted to the stationary frame (14) .
3. A chair as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein the support (18) comprises at least one elongate element (24) disposed on either side of the seat frame (12) .
4. A chair as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the support (18) comprises two elongate elements (24) disposed on either side of the seat frame (12) .
5. A chair as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the support (18) is accommodated within the stationary frame (14) .
6. A chair as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein the elongate elements (24) are joined to the seat frame (12) and the armrests (22) by free moving but rigid bearings such as black nylon, metal, metal/inorganic materials or ball bearings.
7. A chair as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the armrests (22) extend beyond the seat front edge. 


 8. A chair as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the front pair of elongate elements (24) can extend above the normal horizontal line of the armrests, and the armrests may be hinged proximate to the front end so that they can be raised from a substantially horizontal position to a substantially vertical position.
9. A chair as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein each armrest 22 is raised at a front end.
10. A chair as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the support (18) or seat frame (12) is provided with a locking means to fix the seat element (20) and armrests (22) in a given position.
11. A chair as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the tilt of the seat back (21) is adjustable.
