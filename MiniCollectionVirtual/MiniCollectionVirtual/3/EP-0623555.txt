<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilized,
halogen-containing resin composition comprising a calcium
compound, a use of a composite metal oxide which is a calcium
oxide-containing solid solution, and a process for the
production of a composite metal oxide. More
specifically, it relates to a halogen-containing resin
composition having excellent heat resistance, chalking
resistance, initial colouring properties and nontoxicity, and to
the use of a
calcium-based composite metal oxide as a heat stabilizer for a
halogen-containing resin.Halogen-containing resins are not heat and
light stable, and a variety of so-called heat stabilizers are therefore
used. Known heat stabilizers are lead
compounds, organic tin compounds and composite organic acid
salts such as Cd/Ba compounds, Ba/Zn compounds and Ca/Zn
compounds.The toxicity of heat stabilizers and their effect on global
environmental pollution are issues which have attracted attention
in recent years. Almost all Cd, Pb, Ba and Sn
compounds have had problems. Development has been
increasingly requested of a nontoxic, safe
stabilizer. A Ca/Zn composite fatty acid salt is now known
as a nontoxic stabilizer. This
Ca/Zn fatty acid salt only gives a poor improvement
in the heat stability of a halogen-containing resin, and the
replacement of the toxic stabilizers with a nontoxic 
stabilizer is still limited at present.On the other hand, it is known that a Cu compound
provides excellent chalking resistance when incorporated
into a halogen-containing resin. However, it cannot be used
for that purpose, since it greatly deteriorates the heat
resistance of a halogen-containing resin, It is therefore
strongly desired to develop a nontoxic Cu-based stabilizer
which can greatly improve the heat-stability of a halogen-containing resin
and a Cu-based stabilizer which does not impair
the heat stability.The present invention seeks to
provide a halogen-containing resin composition which is stable to
heat and light.The present
invention also seeks to provide a
stabilizer which can provide a halogen-containing
resin composition with excellent heat stability.The present invention
provides a halogen-containing resin composition comprising
