<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of polyacetals by the copolymerisation of glyoxylic acid esters with cyclic formals derived from dioles, homopolymers of formaldehyde, trioxepane or mixture of these compounds, in which up to 50 wt % of this group of monomers may be replaced by other conventional copolymerisable monomers like epoxides, aldehydes with at least 2 C atoms, tetrahydrofurane and/or C2 to C4 olefines, in the presence of anionic or cationic polymerisation initiators and possibly the hydrolysis of the glyoxyl acid esters polymerised into the copolymer, use of the polyacetal carboxylates thus obtainable as an additive in low-phosphate and phosphate-free washing and cleaning agents, as a water treatment agent and as a dispersant for finely divided substances, and polyacetals which are obtainable by the anionically or cationically initiated copolymerisation of glyoxyl acid esters with cyclic formals derived from diols and possibly the introduction of stable final groups and possibly hydrolysis of the ester groups of the glyoxyl acid esters polymerised into the copolymers.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing polyacetals by 
copolymerization of 


(a) glyoxylic esters with 
(b) other copolymerizable monomers 
 
in the presence of anionic or cationic polymerization 

initiators, with or without the introduction of stable 
end groups and with or without hydrolysis of the 

copolymerized units of monomer (a) present in the 
copolymer, which comprises using as monomers (b) cyclic 

formals derived from diols, homopolymers of formaldehyde, 
trioxepane or mixtures thereof, although up to 50 % by 

weight of this group of monomers may be replaced by other 
customary copolymerizable monomers. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
dioxolane, butanediol formal and/or trioxane are used as 

monomers (b). 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
other customary copolymerizable monomers used are 

(c) epoxides, aldehydes having at least 2 carbon atoms, 
tetrahydrofuran and/or C
2
-C
4
-olefins. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the ends of the polymer chains have added to them 

chemically stable groups to confer stability on the 
polyacetals against degradation at an alkaline pH. 
The use of the polyacetals obtainable as claimed 
in claims 1 to 4 as additive in reduced-phosphate and 

phosphate-free detergents and cleaners, as water treatment 
agent, and as dispersant for finely divided 

substances. 
Polyacetals obtainable by anionically or  
 

cationically initiated polymerization of 

(a) glyoxylic esters with 
(b) cyclic formals derived from diols with the exception 
of those cyclic formals derived from 1,2-diols, 

although if desired up to 50 % by weight of this 
group of monomers can be replaced by other customary 

copolymerizable monomers, 
 
with or without the introduction of stable end groups and 

with or without hydrolysis of the ester groups of the 
copolymerized units of monomer (a) present in the 

copolymers.
