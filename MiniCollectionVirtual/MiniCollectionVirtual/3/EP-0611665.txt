<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided for operating a document assembly 
system. Assembly is initiated of a set of documents in a sequence. 

Improper assembly is detected of a particular one of the documents. 
Assembly is reinitiated of a replacement for the particular document 

at a point along the assembly line being located after the entry point, 
in particular by customizing a generic document at the customization 

point.
 

Assembly of replacement for the improperly assembled particular document 
is reinitiated after each preceding document in the sequence of the set 

is no longer being assembled. 
Further disclosed is a method of calibrating a document assembly 
system by sensing the activation of an activation element during 

operation of the document assembly line, and using the sensed activation 
for determining positional information. 
Further disclosed is a method of monitoring a document assembly 
system by producing supplementary quality documents after assembly of 

production documents has been initiated. The supplementary documents are 
selected out of a plurality of document types.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to document assembly
systems.A document assembly system assembles documents such as books,
magazines and newspapers. In a document assembly system, one or more
documents can be subject to an error in assembly. Such errantly
assembled documents are desirably replaced by an identical document.A typical non-demographic controlled system assembles a set of
substantially identical documents. Since all assembled documents are
substantially identical, previous techniques replace errantly assembled
documents by assembling additional documents irrespective of sequence.By comparison, a demographic controlled system assembles different
types of custom documents in specified combinations, quantities, and
sequences. Accordingly, the specified sequence and combination of custom
documents is not maintained by previous techniques that replace errantly
assembled documents by merely assembling additional documents. Moreover,
such previous techniques fail to assist in maintaining the initial
presorting of documents to preserve postage savings for bulk mailings
where replacement documents are assembled.To various extents, other previous techniques attempt to preserve
some postage savings for bulk mailings. Nevertheless, such previous
techniques present other shortcomings. For example, one previous
technique purges properly assembled documents in order to assemble a
replacement for an errantly assembled document.Another previous technique stops the operation of a document
assembly line in order to assemble a replacement for an errantly
assembled document. Yet another previous technique reorders documents by
using multiple paths between two points, so that additional paths and
equipment are required to be added to a conventional bindery line in
order to suitably reorder documents. Other previous techniques fail to
accommodate a perfect bindery system in which different conveyor sections
operate asynchronously. US Patent Publication 4500083 discloses a
collating and binding system with postage indication. The reordering of 
a rejected book takes place in accordance with a comparison of the postal
information of the rejected book with the postal information of a book on
the conveyor, typically the current or most recently assembled book. Thus, a need has arisen for a method and system for operating a
document assembly system, which assist in maintaining the initial
presorting of documents to preserve postage savings for bulk mailings
where replacement documents are assembled. Also, a

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a document assembly system comprising the
steps of:


initiating assembly of a set of documents in a sequence along a
document assembly line having an entry point:
detecting improper assembly of a particular one of said documents;
storing (454,456) indications of said particular documents;
sorting (460) said stored indications according to said sequence;
and
reinitiating assembly of a replacement document for said particular
document beginning at a point along said document assembly line after

said entry point after all preceding documents in the sequence have been
assembled and according to said sequence in response to said sorted

indications.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said reinitiating step
comprises the step of reinitiating assembly of said particular document

by customizing a generic document beginning at a point along said
document assembly line after said entry point.
A method as claimed in Claim 2 comprising the step of determining a
customization point along said document assembly line.
A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said customizing step
comprises the step of customizing said generic document beginning at said

customization point.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said detecting
step comprises the step of detecting improper assembly of a partially

assembled one of said documents.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising the step of
diverting said particular document at an earliest possible divert point

along said document assembly line. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising the step of
reassigning said replacement document to an assigned subset of said set

of documents.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising the step of
disabling initiation of assembly of said documents of said set until

assembly of said replacement document is initiated.
