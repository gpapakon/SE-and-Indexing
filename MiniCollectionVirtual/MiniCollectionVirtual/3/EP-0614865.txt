<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing olefin having a terminal double bond by 
trimerizing at least one monomer selected from a group 
consisting of ethylene, propylene and 1-butene. For producing olefin having a terminal double 
bond, such as 1-hexene, by trimerizing olefin monomer, 
such as ethylene, the following processes are known: (a) 
a process which comprises using a catalyst comprising 
the reaction product of a chromium compound, a 
hydrocarbyl aluminum hydrolyzed with certain amount of 
water, and a donor ligand (U.S. Patent No. 4,668,838); 
(b) a process which comprises using a catalyst 
comprising a chromium containing compound such as 
chromium pyrrolides, and aluminum compound (European 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 0 416 304); (c) a 
process which comprises using a catalyst comprising a 
chromium complex containing a coordinating polydentate 
ligand, and an aluminoxane (European Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 0 537 609). However, the process (a) has problems of 
insufficient activity of the catalyst and poor 
selectivity to the intended product. It also has  
 
difficulty of maintaining the activity of the catalyst. 
The process (b) has problem of insufficient activity of 
the catalyst and is difficult in preparation of the 
catalyst. The process (c), the process has problem of 
poor selectivity to the intended product by the 
catalyst. Therefore, none of the processes reached the 
satisfactory level in producing said olefin.  
 EP-A-0 416 304 discloses chromium-containing compounds, such as, 
for example, chromium pyrrolides, which are prepared by forming 
a mixture of a chromium salt, a metal amide, and an electron 
pair donor solvent, such as, for example, an ether. These 
chromium-containing, or chromium pyrrolide, compounds can be 
used either unsupported or supported on an inorganic oxide 
support to trimerize and/or polymerize olefins.  
 An object of the present invention is to 
provide a convenient and effective process for producing 
olefin having a terminal double bond such as 1-hexene, 
which is also good in the industrial application. This and other objects will become apparent 
from the following description of the invention. In the process for producing olefin having a 
terminal double bond by trimerizing olefin monomer, the 
present inventors have found that application of a 
specific catalyst in the present invention to the 
reaction can satisfy the object described above based 
not only on its high activity and high selectivity to 
the
