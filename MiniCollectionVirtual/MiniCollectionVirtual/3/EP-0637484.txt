<ABSTRACT>
A wrench for tightening a tightening member to another 
member by revolving the tightening member around its axis, 

wherein the wrench comprises an inner surface which is 
attached to the outer surface of the tightening member. On 

the inner surface, a recess is provided to store a wedge 
member and is configured by a continuous formation of a slack 

area and a wedge area. The wedge member is configured to 
wedge between the outer surface of the tightening member and 

the wall of the wedge area when the wrench body is rotated in 
the one direction, in order to place the wedge member in the 

wedge area, whereby the wrench and the tightening member are 
unified regarding the relevant direction, enabling the 

rotation of the tightening member in the relevant direction 
through the wrench.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool for tightening a
revolving tightening member, such as a nut and bolt or a nut
on a chucking device for machine tools, and in particular, to
a wrench which can easily be attached to a tightening member.In the past, various kinds of tightening members such as
nuts and bolts which are tightened when revolved around an
axis have been known. Generally, edges are provided on the
outer surface of the tightening member by, for example,
forming the tightening member into a prismatic shape, such as
a hexagon. A wrench or other tool comprising an open end to
fit the shape of the tightening member can be attached to
grasp the outer surface edges of the tightening member. By
revolving the tool, the tightening member can be tightened.The above-mentioned mechanism can also be used for
tightening nuts on chucking devices or cutting tool holders,
i.e., where the outer surface of the tightening nut is knurled
and a recess or engagement groove is formed to receive the
wrench. However, placing a wrench on the edges or engagement
grooves of a nut is both time consuming and burdensome.
Moreover, the manufacturing process for such nuts is made
more complex, as recesses and grooves on the tightening
member must be formed, or the tightening member must be
formed with an edged shape.Moreover, the relative angle of the wrench enabling it to
connect with the edges or grooves of such nuts is so limited
that if the space around the nut is insufficient, the wrench
may not be able to connect to the nut, depending on the angle
of the nut.US-A-3906822 discloses an open end one-direction wrench
according to the preamble of claim 1
in which turning of the wrench on for example a nut in one
direction forces a plurality of gripping members to tighten,
and turning in the other direction forces the gripping members
away from the nut.Therefore, this invention, in order to solve these
problems, provides a wrench which can be easily attached to a
tightening member, which enables easier manufacturing of a
tightening member, and which can easily tighten a tightening
member even when there is limited space in the area around the
tightening member. According to the present invention there is provided a
wrench for tightening a tightening member to another member by
rotating said tightening member around its own axis,
comprising:
a body having an inner surface to be attached to an outer
surface of said tightening member;at least one rotatable wedge member provided on said
inner surface of said body having a

<CLAIMS>
A wrench for tightening a tightening member (22) to
another member by rotating said tightening member (22) around

its own axis, comprising:

a body (35) having an inner surface (38) to be attached
to an outer surface (23) of said tightening member (22);
at least one rotatable wedge member (44) provided on said
inner surface (38) of said body (35) having a wedged state in

which it wedges between said outer surface (23) of said
tightening member (22) and said inner surface (38) of said

body (35)
at least one recess (42) with a circularly-curved cross
section formed on said inner surface (38) of said body (35)

for receiving said at least one wedge member (44), each recess
(42) including a slack area (41) for housing said wedge member

(44) in a non-wedged state and a first wedge area (43)
flanking one side of said slack area (41), the first wedge

area being for housing said wedge member (44) in said wedged
state, the depth of said slack area (41) being greater than

that of said first wedge area (43); and
a retainer (58) disposed on said inner surface (38) of
said body (35) and having a respective aperture (64) to

maintain said at least one wedge member (44) in a
predetermined position along said inner surface, said retainer

(58) being configured so as to be movable in the direction of
the circumference of said inner surface (38) of said body (35)

to a predetermined extent, for moving said wedge member from
said slack area to said first wedge area upon rotation of said body

in at least one direction whereby said wedge member (44)
protrudes from said retainer into the wrench opening (40) in which

the tightening member (22) is received characterised by:-
said at least one recess (44) having a second wedge area
(43) flanking said slack area on a side opposite said one

side; and
at least one pin-like stopper (63) for preventing said at
least one wedge
 member (44) and the retainer (58) from moving
from said slack area to said second wedge area (43).
A wrench according to claim 1, wherein said at least one
wedge member (44) is cylindrical in shape.
A wrench according to claim 1, wherein said at least one
wedge member (44) is spherical in shape.
A wrench according to claim 1, wherein said inner surface
(38) of said body (35) is formed so as to surround completely

said outer surface (23) of said tightening member (22).
A wrench according to any foregoing claim, wherein said
retainer (58) is annular, and further comprising a biasing

means for biasing said retainer (58) such that said at least
one wedge member (44) is biased from said slack area (41)

towards said wedge area (43), said biasing means comprising a
ring-shaped spring (60) corresponding in shape to that of said

retainer (58).
