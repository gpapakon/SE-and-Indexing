<ABSTRACT>
A well screen is composed of a plurality of screen 
units (2) connected in series. Each of said screen units 

(2) has a cylindrical connecting section (3) at least at 
one end thereof and includes a plurality of support rods 

extending (6) in the axial direction of the screen 
disposed cylindrically about a section (4) of the screen 

other than the connecting section (3) at a predetermined 
interval in the circumferential direction of the screen, 

and a wire (8) wound on the outer periphery of said 
support rods (6a) so as to form slits (7) of a 

predetermined width. The well screen further includes 
outer diameter equalizing means (9) provided about 

adjacent ones of the connecting sections (3) of two of 
the screen units (2) connected to each other for 

substantially equalizing the outer diameter of said 
connecting sections (3) to the outer diameter of 

sections (4) other than the connecting sections (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
oil well, gas well, water well and subterranean
pollution remediation well equipment.Many types of screens and filtering devices are
known in the art that are designed to exclude sand and
other solids from fluids and gases produced from oil
gas, water and pollution remediation wells without undue
restriction of the production rate of fluids or
gases. These devices are often used with filter aids,
such as gravel and/or sand, which are either
incorporated within the device or separately placed
surrounding the device.Wire wrapped screens and prepacked screens are
examples of devices used inside a drilled hole. The
drilled hole may be left open or may have a casing or
liner cemented and perforated prior to positioning such
a device. Openings in such screens may be designed to
stop, or bridge undesirable solids contained in fluids
or gases.Screens and well liners are often surrounded by
filter aids. The filter aids consist commonly of
gravel. When used with filter aids or gravel, the
openings in the screens and liners are designed to stop, 
or bridge
the undesirable solids contained in
the produced fluids or gases.Prepacked screens, porous material filter devices
and such are examples of devices that incorporate a
filter medial in the screen body. These devices are
used for the same purpose and these filter aids commonly
consist of gravel.Multiple wrapped screens provide two or more
concentric wire wrappings which act as multiple filters
in one device to prevent intervention of undesirable solids
and are often used with filter aids, such as gravel, in
the well bore.As shown in Fig. 13, screen units of conventional
well screens usually consist of lengths (joints) of
from 5 to 10 meters with short lengths of blank (non-screen)
pipe at each end. The purposes of the short
length of blank pipe at each end
are (1) to
provide a means of connecting the joints together at a
well site and (2) to facilitate holding each screen
joint in a well-head as the joints are assembled for
lowering into the well.The length of blank sections at the ends of each
joint of screen must be long enough to allow for threads
required for connecting the joints, and must be long 
enough to allow room to hang each joint in the well-head
while joints are connected together. The total blank
length is commonly 0.5 to 1 meter, after two joints have
been connected together.A screen consisting of screen units which are
connected together is commonly lowered, and
centrallized, in a well bore to a
