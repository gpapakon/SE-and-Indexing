<ABSTRACT>
Vertical partitioning system composed of panels An mounted so that they can slide between two slideways, and the vertical edges of which are equipped with at least one longitudinal connection piece P, P' serving to gauge the thickness of the panel, characterised in that the said connection piece P, P' interacts with a post B independent of the slideways, which is located between two adjacent panels An which it connects together mechanically by clipping its two faces opposite the vertical edges into the connection pieces P, P' cladding the said edges, and whose spacing it simultaneously defines.

Vertical partitioning system composed of panels A
n
, 
channels and posts (B); the panels A
n
 are slidably mounted 
between two channels, and their vertical edges have a groove 

and are equipped with at least one longitudinal connecting 
piece P, P' serving to calibrate the said groove in the panel 

with respect to the post (B), characterised in that the said 
connecting piece P, P' cooperates with a post B, independent 

of the channels, which is fitted between two adjacent panels A
n
 
which it connects mechanically by the snapping of its two 

faces opposite the vertical edges into the connecting pieces 
P, P' cladding the said edges, and whose spacing it 

simultaneously determines. 
Partitioning system according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the posts B placed between two adjacent panels A
n
 can be 
unsnapped by exerting a force in the same direction in each 

case and in the opposite direction to that required during the 
snapping-in operation. 
Partitioning system according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the connecting pieces P, P' fixed to the 

edges of the panels A
n
 are identical on both edges of each 
panel A
n
. 
System according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
connecting pieces P, P' have a double symmetry with respect to 

the mid-plane of the partition and with respect to their 
transverse mid-plane. 
Partitioning system according to the preceding claim, 

characterised in that each floating post B placed between two 
adjacent panels A
n
 has a double symmetry with respect to the 
mid-plane of the partition and with respect to its transverse 

mid-plane.  
 
Partitioning system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the connecting pieces P, P' have 

substantially the shape of a female connecting part in the 
form of a dovetail, obtained by folding over the transverse 

edges of a longitudinal sheet by an angle greater than 90° and 
curving the ends outwards, and in that longitudinal 

depressions 1, 1', 2, 2' are provided in the posts B in 
proximity to the corner edges, designed to receive the said 

curved ends at the time of snapping in. 
Partitioning system according to the preceding claim, 
characterised in that one of the faces of the post B is 

incomplete and has an axial slot over the entire length of the 
post. 
Partitioning system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one removable panel A₃ 

is fitted in each direction of development of the partition. 
Partitioning system according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that each door A₆ fitted to the partition has at least one 

adjacent removable panel A₃. 
Partitioning system according to one of Claims 8 and 9, 
characterised in that the removable panels A₃ have two 

independent facings a₃, a'₃ attached to studs 3 fixed to one 
face of the central post B by means of apertures 4 formed in 

the said facings, and in that they serve as technical panels 
A₃. 
Partitioning system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the facings a
n
, a'
n
, the 
connecting pieces P, P' and the posts B are produced by the 

profiling of metal sheets.
