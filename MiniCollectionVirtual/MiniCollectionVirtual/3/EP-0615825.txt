<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for filling moulds (2) with casting resin or similar castable fluids by means of a feed device, such as for example a pumping device (1; 6, 6') or a pressure vessel (28). To carry out the mould filling operations in a preprogrammed and exactly reproducible way with regard to the filling speed or filling rate, the casting resin is fed to the mould (2) in accordance with a predetermined filling profile for the amount of casting resin per unit of time (filling rate) by means of the feeding device.

Method for the filling of casting moulds (2) with casting resin or the like pourable
liquid media by means of a feeding equipment displaying a pump equipment (1; 6, 6') and

a buffer element (17) connected downstream of the feeding equipment, characterised
thereby, that the conveying rate of the pump equipment (1; 6, 6') divides up in the buffer

element (17) into a preset filling rate for the casting mould (2) and a storage rate of the
buffer element (17), wherein the quantity of casting resin respectively stored in the buffer

element (17) during the conveying movement is conveyed to the casting mould (2) in
accordance with the preset filling rate during the induction movement of the pump

equipment (1; 6, 6') until the renewed conveying movement of the pump equipment (1; 6,
6') sets in.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the casting resin is fed
under constrained control.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the actual filling rate of
casting resin is ascertained and the filling rate is further regulated in the case of a

deviation from the preset target value.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby, that the actual
filling rate to the casting mould (2) is ascertained by way of the movement of the displacing

element (21) of the buffer element (17).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby, that the
conveying movements of the pump equipment (1; 6, 6') and the movements of the

displacing element (21) of the buffer element (17) take place in dependence on the preset
filling profile.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby, that the
buffer element (17) is constructed for the maintenance of the gelling pressure loading the

casting mould (2).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby, that a
throughflow quantity regulation (30) arranged downstream of the feeding equipment or, in 

a given case, of the buffer element (17) is actuated in dependence on the regulating
magnitude for the filling rate.
Device for the filling of casting moulds (2) with casting resin or the like pourable
liquid media by means of a feeding equipment displaying a pump equipment (1; 6, 6') and

a buffer element (17) connected downstream of the feeding equipment, in particular for the
performance of the method according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby,

that the operating movements of the pump equipment (1; 6, 6,') and the buffer element
(17) are constrainedly coupled with a preselectable coupling ratio which can in a given

case be varied during the filling operation.
Device according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that a regulating equipment
(24, 24') is provided, which regulates the filling rate in dependence on a comparison of

target value and actual value.
Device for ascertaining the flow rate of pourable liquid media, such as for example
casting resin, characterised thereby, that a buffer element (17) is provided, with a

displacing element (17), which deviates in the sense of an enlargement of the storage

volume of the buffer element (17) in the case of an increase in the flow rate towards the
buffer element (17) and which deviates back in the sense of a reduction in the storage

volume in the case of a decrease in the flow rate towards the buffer element (17), and with
an equipment for ascertaining the temporal change or changes of the storage volume of

the buffer element (17).
