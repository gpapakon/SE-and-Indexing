<ABSTRACT>
The transaction data are acquired, treated and stored by a processing device arranged in the immediate proximity of measurement instruments, which processing device includes a control processor (H), and a storage module (S). The data are stored on non-volatile and redundant media (3,5) and under the supervision of a supervisory element (5) (possibly included within the control processor). Requests to be executed are transmitted thereto by the control processor (H) by way of a transmission path (L), and a buffer memory (8). The data involved in these requests are written and read on the storage media (3,5) via a backed-up memory (6). Permanent checks are made to verify the quality and fidelity of all internal transfers and also to back up the data in the event of an anomaly in the power supply. The safeguarded data in memory can be read upon an outside request. Application to the storage of values measured in particular by authorised apparatus for measuring volumes of liquids or solids.

A method of simplifying the acquisition and
management of transaction data derived from measurements

taken by measuring means (M1 to Mp), characterised in
that it incorporates security-protected local storage of

measurements by providing locally, in addition to the
measuring means, at least one local processing unit

consisting of a control processor (H), storage means with
several local storage units (3, 4, 6, 8) and control

means (5) set up so as to respond to commands from the
control processor (H) to manage storage of validated

measurement values and control data transfers between the
different local storage units so that all the means

needed to acquire and provide security-protected storage
for transaction data can be concentrated on a single

site.
A method as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterised in that it incorporates the remote transfer

of security-protected stored data when requested by means
for managing said transactions.
A method as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterised in that the secure storage of transaction

data includes copying these data by the storage means and
controls applied to data exchanges between the various

local storage units.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that it includes connecting the control

processor (H) to the control means (5) via a secure
transmission line (L1).
A method as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterised in that the control processor (H) and the

control means (5) are directly linked.
A device for simplifying the acquisition and
management of transaction data derived from measurements 

taken by measuring units (1), characterised in that it
has at least one local processing system directly

connected to the measuring means (1) and consisting of at
least one control processor (H) with means for acquiring

and validating the measurement data and at least one
local module (S) for storing the validated data which has

several storage units (3, 4, 6, 8) and control means (5)
programmed to respond to commands from the control

processor (H) to control the storage of validated
measurement values and control data transfers between the

various local storage units in order to ensure that the
values freely accessible from outside the processing

device when the at least one local storage module is
being read are the same as the values actually measured.
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterised in
that each storage module (S) has a first and a second

storage unit (3, 4), control means (5) set up to control
the storage of validated measurement values in the first

storage unit (3) and to copy said values into the second
storage unit (4), a backing storage (6) for storing any

transfer in progress between the control means (5) and
the control processor (H) and a buffer memory (8) for

transfers between the control processor (H) and the
storage module (S), said control means (5) being set up

to control data transfers between the different storage
units.
A device as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterised in that the buffer memory (8) has a first

zone (8A) for writing queries from the control processor
(H) an
d execution reports from the control means (5) and
a second zone (8B) for writing data exchanged between the

control processor (H) and said control means (5).
A device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that it has means (9) for testing that

an external power supply source (A) and control means (5) 
are operating correctly.
A device as claimed in one of claims 7 to 9, the
resulting combination of claims including claim 7,

characterised in that the two storage units (3, 4) are
memories of the non-volatile, static type.
A device as claimed in one of claims 7 to 10,
the resulting combination of claims including claim 7,

characterised in that the second storage unit (4) is a
memory for copying the data from the first storage unit

(3), the control means (5) being set up to check that the
validated data in the two storage units are identical.
A device as claimed in one of claims 7 to 11,
the resulting combination of claims including claim 7,

characterised in that the requisite data for controlling
the storage units (3, 4) is in the backing storage (6).
A device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 12,
characterised in that the control means (5) are connected

to the control processor by a secure linking channel
(L1).
A device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 13,
characterised in that the control means (5) are arranged

A device as claimed in one of claims 7 to 14,
the resulting combination of claims including claim 7,

characterised in that the control processor (H) is
arranged in the proximity of the buffer memory (8).
A device as claimed in one of claims 6 to 15,
characterised in that it has several control processors

(H) linked respectively to several measuring units (1)

A method of simplifying the acquisition and 
management of data relating to the delivery of fluids at

storage units (3, 4, 6, 8) and control means (5) set

secure can be concentrated on a single site; and
the remote transfer of the stored data when
requested by external means for managing said

transactions.
