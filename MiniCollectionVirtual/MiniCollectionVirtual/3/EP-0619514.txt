disclosed. The light-sensitive material comprises a support 

having thereon a silver halide emulsion layer and optionally 
having another layer, and the emulsion layer or the other 

layer contains a kind of polymer latex comprising a polymer 
having a repeating unit derived from a monomer having a 

solubility in water at 25°C of not higher than 0.025 % by 
weight, and said support comprises polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate 

and has a thickness of from 70 µm to 120 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material, and particularly
relates to a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material in which the occurrence of development unevenness and
roller marks caused by pressure fogging and pressure
desensitization in the case of rapid processing in an
automatic processing machine is prevented.Recently, following photographic technologies,
enhancement of the sensitivity of silver halide photographic
light-sensitive materials and enhancement of image quality are
strongly demanded. In addition, following enhancement of
consumption amount of light-sensitive materials, reduction of
processing time has come to be demanded strongly.For rapid processing, developability must be enhanced and
drying load must be lightened. For example, rapid processing 
is attained by enhancing developerbility by processing a
light-sensitive material at a high pH and a high temperature
(30 to 40 °C) and reducing the amount of the binder in the
light-sensitive material. However, there were some problem in
the above-mentioned rapid processing. For example, due to the
pressure of a conveyance roller, a so-called roller mark
occurs, causing deterioration in image. In addition, in the
course of slitting and packaging of a film and handling during
diagnosis, pressure blackening occurs.As means for improving the roller mark and the pressure
blackening, methods to enhance the iodide content inside the
structure of silver halide grains and to use latex have been
reported. However, when the iodide content inside silver
halide is enhanced, pressure desensitization is caused. In
other words, the effect of this method is to take balance of
contradictory performances of pressure blackening and pressure
desensitization so that it is not a perfect solution of the
problem. In addition, using of latex enhances the amount of
binder. Accordingly, there were some shortcomings in terms of
drying property and color residual property of the light-sensitive
material in photographic processing. EP-A-0496346 relates to a silver halide photographic material
comprising a support comprising a polyester having a
hydrophilic group and having a thickness of 25 to 250 µm.DE-A-2048455 dicloses a silver halide photographic material
which comprises a copolymer-latex of acrylate or methacrylate
with a vinyl ester as a binder. An object of the present invention is to provide a silver
halide photographic light-sensitive material with high
sensitivity and high image quality wherein development
