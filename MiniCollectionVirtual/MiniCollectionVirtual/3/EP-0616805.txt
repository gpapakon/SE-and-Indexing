<ABSTRACT>
The use of acyl L-carnitine esters with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid 
is described of the formula 


 
wherein R is straight or branched acyl with from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, 
preferably acetyl, propionyl, n-butyryl, isobutyryl and isovaleryl, and X is 

the anion of a pharmacologically acceptable acid or of the corresponding 
inner salts to produce a drug to suppress withdrawal symptoms and 

craving for alcohol in alcoholics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new therapeutical use of acyl L-carnitine
esters with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid of formula (I)

which represents them in the form of inner salts, wherein R is straight
or branched acyl with from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably acetyl,
propionyl, n-butyryl, isobutyryl and isovaleryl,
or formula (I')

which represents them in the form of salts with pharmacologically
acceptable acids, where R has the meaning indicated above and X- is the
anion of such an acid.X- is, for example: chloride; bromide; iodide, aspartate,
particularly acid aspartate; citrate, particularly acid citrate; tartrate;
phosphate, particularly acid phosphate: fumarate, particularly acid
fumarate; glycerophosphate; glucose phosphate; lactate; maleate,
particularly acid maleate; orotate; oxalate, particularly acid oxalate;
sulphate, particularly acid sulphate; trichloroacetate; trifluoro-acetate
and
methanesulphonate. The formula (I) or formula (I') esters are used for the preparation
of a drug for the treatment of subjects abusing alcoholic beverages. In
alcoholics, this drug suppresses withdrawal symptoms (such as tremors,
perspiration, hyperreflexia, nausea, anxiety and convulsions) and the
craving for alcohol.The formula (I) and (I') esters are known compounds. In European
patent application n° 0442 850 A1 (published on 21.08.91) their
synthesis, physico-chemical characteristics and pharmacological activity
in inhibiting neuronal degeneration (as occurring typically in Alzheimer's
dementia and in Parkinson's disease) and in the treatment of coma are
described.In European patent application n° 0514 357 A1 (published on
19.11.92) a further therapeutic use of these formula (I) and (I') esters to
produce a drug for the treatment of liver disease is described.There is no relationship between these known uses and the use
envisaged in this invention.All the drugs used to date for the treatment of alcoholism present
substantial drawbacks.A number of the drugs commonly used in the treatment of alcohol
withdrawal syndrome are similar to this with regard to their
pharmacological effects. In fact, the most useful of those currently used
are those with which alcohol develops a cross tolerance. All patients
treated for withdrawal syndromes are potential candidates for SNC
depressants though not all of them need them.Paraldehyde, which was once extensively used in therapy, was
completely abandoned on account of its disagreeable odor and a series of 
sudden, inexplicable deaths following its use.Rarely used today
