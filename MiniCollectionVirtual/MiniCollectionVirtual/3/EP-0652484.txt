<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a positive 
photoresist composition comprising a 1,2-naphthoquinone-diazide 

compound and a novolac resin obtained through a 
condensation reaction between an aldehyde compound and a 

phenol compound represented by the following general 
formula (I): 


wherein R₅, R₆ and R₇ each independently represents 
hydrogen atom, hydroxyl group or alkyl, cycloalkyl, 

alkoxy or alkenyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or 
aryl group, provided that at least one of R₅, R₆ and R₇ 

represents a cycloalkyl group having 6 or less carbon 
atoms. The composition of the present invention is 

excellent in the balance between properties such as 
sensitivity, resolution, heat resistance, profile, depth 

of focus, etc. and free from scum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positive
resist composition sensitive to radiations such as ultraviolet
rays, far ultraviolet rays including excimer
laser, etc.Recently, with a rise in the integration level
of integrated circuits, formation of pattern of submicron
order is required. As its result, a positive
resist composition free from scum (undeveloped residue)
and further excellent in properties such as resolution,
profile, depth of focus, heat resistance, etc. is
demanded. Particularly in the production of 16-64
MDRAMs, it is necessary to resolve a pattern having a
line width of 0.5 µm or less with a good profile and a
good depth of focus.JP-A-62-260146
discloses a positive photoresist composition containing a
substituted phenol novolac resin which is a condensation
product of formaldehyde and a mixed phenol component
comprising 90.0-99.5% by weight of a mixture of m-cresol
and at least one phenol compound represented by the
following formula: 

wherein R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group having 1-6
carbon atoms located in the ortho or para position, and
10.0-0.5% by weight of at least one phenol compound
represented by the following formula:

wherein R2 and R3 each independently represents alkyl,
alkenyl or aryl group having 1-6 carbon atoms provided
that at least one of R2 and R3 is located in the 2- or
4-position and R2 and R3 cannot simultaneously be methyl
groups, and R4 represents hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl or
aryl group having 1-6 carbon atoms and a photosensitizer
constituted mainly of naphthoquinonediazidesulfonic acid
ester, wherein the content of the photosensitizer is
20-60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the
substituted phenol novolac resin.This composition, however, cannot resolve a
pattern having a line width of 0.5 µm or less with a
broad depth of focus with a good profile.It is the object of the present invention to provide a
positive resist composition excellent in the balance between 
properties such as sensitivity, resolution, heat resistance,
profile and depth of focus and free from scum.This object has been achieved by
a positive resist composition comprising a 1,2-naphthoquinonediazide
compound and a novolac resin
obtainable through a condensation reaction between an
aldehyde compound and a phenol compound represented by
the following general formula (I):

wherein R5 to R7 each independently represents hydrogen
atom, hydroxyl group or alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy or
alkenyl group having 6 or less carbon atoms or aryl
group, provided that at least one of R5 to R7 is
cy
