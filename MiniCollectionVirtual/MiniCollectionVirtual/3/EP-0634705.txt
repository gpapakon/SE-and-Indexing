<ABSTRACT>
According to an image forming apparatus of the 
present invention, a developer filling opening (112) is 

formed in an end of a casing (50) which is provided with 
a developer-filled section (51), a holder section (110) 

is arranged round the developer filling opening (112) to 
hold a developer cartridge (80), guides (116, 117) are 

arranged adjacent to the developer cartridge holder 
section (110) to guide the developer cartridge (80) to 

the developer cartridge holder section (110) when it is 
inserted into a developing unit (13) from one side 

thereof, and the developer cartridge (80) is attached to 
the developer cartridge holder section (110), when the 

developer-filled section (51) with developer D in the 
developer cartridge, said developer consisting of toner 

T and carrier C mixed at a predetermined rate. The 
filling of developer or toner can be therefore more 

easily and quickly achieved without detaching the 
developing unit from the image forming apparatus. In 

addition, the developer and toner cartridges can be more 
easily and quickly attached to the developing unit from 

one side thereof when viewed in the horizontal 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developer apparatus having
those features which are indicated in the preamble clause of
claim 1 and are disclosed in e.g. US-A-4 899 690. This prior
art document discloses an image forming apparatus including a
two-compartment container for supplying toner or a mixture of
toner and carrier to a development station. The development
station has means for receiving the container in a toner
supplying position and has an egress for spent developer. The
container has means cooperable with the station for
positioning the container in a toner supplying position. The
container includes a first compartment for containing fresh
toner and a second compartment having an ingress mateable
with the spent developer egress on the receiving station
through which ingress and egress spent developer can overflow
into the second compartment.With this structure, the two-compartment container is placed
in a toner supplying position at the station. Spent developer
automatically flows into the second compartment while toner
and carrier are supplied from the first compartment to the
station. When the first compartment is empty, the container
is replaced and disposed of, automatically disposing of the
spent developer. With this structure, the spent developer can
be readily disposed of by an operator and does not require
attention of a service person.The ingress for spent developer to the second compartment may
be coverable by a door which is in a normally closed position
but which is openable in response to positioning of the
container in its toner supplying position.An image forming apparatus is usually provided with a developing unit for developing an
electrostatic latent image on an image carrier with two-component
developer consisting of toner and carrier.Conventionally, the image forming apparatus of this
type is used in such a way that a developing unit which
has been stored, previously filling it with developer
consisting of toner and carrier mixed at a predetermined
rate, is prepared and that it is set in the image
forming apparatus. According to this system, however,
toner becomes hardened during the storage of the
developing unit. Or toner becomes deteriorated when
developer is filled in the developing unit for a long
time.Recently, therefore, developer is filled in the
empty developing unit just before it is used. Some
typical examples of this system are known. In a typical
one, a top cover is removed from the developing unit
after it is detached from the image forming apparatus,
and

<CLAIMS>
A developer apparatus (13) wherein a developer (D),
including a toner (T) and a carrier (C), is charged from

a developer cartridge (80), comprising:

a developer housing (13) for receiving and storing the
developer (D) supplied from the developer cartridge

(80); and
a first inlet section (110), having a first opening
(112) and provided on the developer housing (13), for

allowing the developer (D) to be supplied from the
developer cartridge (80) to the developer housing (13);

characterized by

a second inlet section, having a second opening (113)
and provided on the developer housing (13), for allowing

a replenishment toner (T) to be supplied from a toner
cartridge (75) after charging of the developer (D).
A developer apparatus (13) according to claim 1,
characterized by further comprising:

means (105) for applying a vibration to the developer
cartridge (80) when the developer cartridge (80) is

mounted on the first inlet section (110) to charge the
developer into the developer housing (13). 
An image forming apparatus (2) including a developer
apparatus according to claim 1, comprising:


first supporting means (116, 117) for detachably
supporting the developer cartridge (80) so as to set a

charge port (81A) of the developer cartridge (80) on the
first inlet section (110);
second supporting means for detachably supporting the
toner cartridge (75) so as to set a supply port of the

toner cartridge (75) on the second inlet section (113);
and
cover means (115), pivotally mounted on the first inlet

section (110) and rotated between first and second
positions, for allowing the first opening (112) to be

opened and preventing the toner cartridge (75) from
being mounted on the second supporting means when the

cover means (115) is set in the first position, and for
covering the first opening (112) and allowing the toner

cartridge (75) to be mounted on the second supporting
means when the cover means (115) is set in the second

position.
An image forming apparatus (2) according to claim 3,
characterized by further comprising:

means (105) for applying a vibration to the developer
cartridge (80) when the developer cartridge (80) is

mounted on the first supporting means (116, 117) to
charge the developer into the developer receiving means

(13). 
An image forming apparatus (2) according to claim 3,
characterized in that the cover means (115) includes a

guiding section (116, 117) for guiding the developer
cartridge (80) to mount the developer cartridge (80) on

the first supporting means (116, 117) when the cover
means (115) is set in the first position.
An image forming apparatus (2) according to claim 3,
characterized in that the cover means (115) includes a
