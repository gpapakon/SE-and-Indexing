<ABSTRACT>
In a process for electroelution of a gel containing separated charged macromolecules, such as proteins or DNA/RNA, a preparatory separation after pre-equilibration of the gel is performed by collective elution of the entire gel in an electroelution apparatus in a suitable specific buffer, whereby the macromolecules are divided into narrow fractions each containing a specific macromolecule or closely related compounds. The electroelution apparatus comprises a base (1) containing a graphite anode (4) and a buffer containing sponge (5) covered by a dialysis membrane (6), a frame (2) containing multiple parallel triangular chambers (7), side vents in the frame to recover the isolated compounds, a graphite cathode (3) built into a safety cover (8) and a template for the precise excision of the gel before electroelution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a novel process 
for electroelution 
of a gel containing separated charged macromolecules, 
such as proteins or DNA/RNA, and 
an apparatus and means for use in the 
process. Electrophoresis of proteins or DNA/RNA in gels is widely 
used to separate compounds which differ in size and/or 
charge. Such compounds exhibit different migration distances 
and can be investigated by staining the gel or by 
transfer to a membrane suited for the study of antibody-antigen 
or other affinity interactions. Recovery of individual 
protein bands, however, is a laborious and time 
consuming procedure which generally has been based on 
cutting the gel into segments containing a single band, 
followed by homogenizing and elution, either by electroelution 
or by simple diffusion. Such a process is often 
ineffective and yields very high dilutions.  
 EP Published Application No. 0 361 062 discloses a method for electrophoretically separating, 
purifying and concentrating charged or polarized macromolecules, said method comprising the 
steps of separating the macromolecules in a separation column containing a plate or bar gel as 
support medium; migrating the separated macromolecules out of the support medium using 
electrophoretic current; feeding the separated macromolecules into a molecule detector; feeding 
the separated macromolecules from the molecule detector into a distributor; and collecting the 
separated macromolecules in a multielectrode collector, each of the electrodes of said collector 
being individually activatable by a signal from the molecule detector. This method requires a 
complicated system comprising a molecule detector and multielectrode collector for sequentially 
collecting the separated macromolecules.  
 US Patent Specification No. 3 956 099 discloses a complex 
system suited for continuous operations, which system 
separates components into separate compartments during the 
electrophoretic run. The procedure is not based on the 
elution of macromolecules already separated in a conventional 
gel, but includes instead a separating unit suited 
for large scale purification of proteins. The processes and components described in US Patent  
 
Specifications No. 4 049 534, No. 4 725 348 and No. 4 747 
918 are all suited for electroelution of small gel fragments 
containing single components. The procedure includes 
a preceeding localization and excision of the desired 
molecule, a technique which is time consuming and involves 
problems with respect to accuracy. The
