<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sighting device (aiming device) which has one optical axis. In addition, the sighting device contains an illuminating device, which emits coloured light, in order to produce a coloured target marker, the target marker being imaged into the eye of the person using the sight. The invention comprises the illuminating device containing luminescent material which is illuminated by natural light (daylight, bright moonlight) or another light source. In this way, an illuminating device is obtained which can dispense with an artificial light source for producing a coloured target marker and without most of the intensity of the natural light being lost by a filter.

<CLAIMS>
Sighting apparatus with an optical axis and with an illumination system emitting colored
light for the generation of a colored sighting mark which is imaged in the user's eye, such

illumination system being provided with a backup light source and containing luminescent
material whic
h is irradiated by natural light such as daylight, bright moonlight or another
light source, thus acting as a light source (10a, 35 a), characterized by the fact that the

illumination system (10, 35, 51) is combined with a photosensitive element (3b) which is
arranged in such a way that it is irradiated by natural light without obstruction, with high

intensity of the incident natural light causing the backup light source to be operated at
maximum power.
Sighting apparatus of claim 1, characterized by the fact that low intensity of the incident
natural light causes the backup light source to be operated at low power.
Sighting apparatus of claim 1, characterized by the fact that a switch (13) is provided for
the backup light source (10b, 35b), permitting the backup light source (10b, 35b) to be

activated in order to enhance the contrast of the sighting mark.
Sighting apparatus of claim 1, wherein the backup light source is an electrical light source,
characterized by the fact that the photosensitive element (3b, 29a, 43) which measures the

intensity of the natural light and adapts the illumination intensity of the backup light source
(10b, 35b) in accordance with the variation in intensity of the natural light is integrated in

the power supply of the electrical light source (10b, 35b, 40).
Sighting apparatus of claim 1, characterized by the fact that the luminescent material (10a,
35a) is designed as a rectangular plate (10a, 35a), with the thickness of the luminescent

material (10a, 35a) being less than its length or width, and with the surface illuminated by
natural light being defined by the length and width of the plate. 
Sighting apparatus of one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized by the fact that a pinhole (9,
37, 56) is provided in front of the illumination system (10, 35, 51).
Sighting apparatus of one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized by the fact that the sighting
apparatus (3, 29, 51) has a closed housing, such housing containing a light channel (12b)

through which the luminescent material (10a, 35a) can be irradiated by natural light.
Sighting apparatus of claim 7, characterized by the fact that the eyepiece end of the housing
is fitted with a transparent housing cover (6, 30, 57) which has no diffracting effect on the

light rays passing through it, by the fact that the objective end of the housing is fitted with a
transparent housing cover (7, 31, 52) with plane-parallel surfaces (31a', 31b') which has no

diffracting effect in the viewing direction on the light beams passing through it, and by the
fact that the housing cover at the objective end (7, 31, 52) reflects the image produced by

the illumination system (10, 35, 51) along the optical axis (3a, 34, 55) of the sighting
apparatus (3, 29, 50) through the housing cover at the eyepiece end (6, 30, 57) into the

user's eye in such a way that the image is focused there.
