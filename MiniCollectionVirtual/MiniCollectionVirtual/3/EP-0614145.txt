<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a test control device 
designed to be connected to a plurality of integrated 
circuits each having an interface provided for the receipt 
and transmission of test data for verifying that the 
respective integrated circuit is functioning correctly. The trend towards increasing functionality of 
integrated circuits has made testing of the devices by 
conventional techniques ever more difficult and it has been 
felt desirable to provide such devices with some means of 
testing whilst in situ. The Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) 
of Europe and North America has proposed a suitable 
architecture which has been incorporated into IEEE standard 
1149.1. It has been proposed to provide a device to be built 
into a circuit and which is operative to generate and 
control the distribution of interrogatory test data. 
However, the known device has only one output and one input 
port and requires the circuits to be tested to be connected 
in series in a ring network. This has the disadvantage that 
all the circuits must be in the test mode at the same time, 
entails a relatively long scan path and requires a large 
amount of processing capability.  This invention provides a test control device designed 
to be connected to a plurality of integrated circuits each 
having an interface provided for the receipt and 
transmission of test data for verifying that the respective 
integrated circuit is functioning correctly, the device 
having a plurality of sets of ports, one set for each of the 
circuits to be tested so that the circuits may be connected 
to the device in parallel to one another. The fact that the control device is connectable in 
parallel to the integrated circuits confers several 
advantages. For example, more frequent testing of the 
circuits can be provided than is the case if all the 
circuits are connected serially and allows a protocol to be 
provided in which several circuits can be tested 
simultaneously. For example data can be supplied to one of 
the circuits under test and, while that data is being 
processed by the respective circuit, the device can supply 
further test data to a further circuit or circuits before 
returning to the first circuit to read the processed data. 
This is because data can take as little as a few 
microseconds to be inputted, but a few milliseconds to 
process. Furthermore the device does not need as much 
processing capability as when the circuits are connected 
serially, and can allow the circuits not being tested to 
operate normally, while
