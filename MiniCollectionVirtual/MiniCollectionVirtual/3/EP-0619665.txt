<ABSTRACT>
A receiver has a plurality of demodulator - decoder pairs, 
corresponding to each of a plurality of modulation schemes. All the 

demodulator - decoder pairs operate simultaneously, and the decision 
error associated with each pair is evaluated. The pair with the lowest 

error is then used. Each demodulator and each decoder may be adaptive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to demodulation 
technique of modulated signals, further to particularly 
effective technique to be applied to demodulation and 
decoding of received signals in a MODEM having plural 
modulation systems, and for example effective technique 
to be utilized for a data communication MODEM or a 
digital picture data MODEM attached to a facsimile. Conventionally, in a data communication 
apparatus such as a facsimile, in order to deal with 
plural modulation systems, an upper processor to control 
a modulator-demodulator by upper control protocol or 
application program changes operation mode of the 
modulator-demodulator into operation mode of a suitable 
modulation system every time. In the above-mentioned method where the upper 
processor controls the modulator-demodulator, there is a  
 
problem that when received signals are demodulated, time 
is required before a suitable modulation system is 
settled. Further, when an operation system is provided 
so that produced error is evaluated by the decision 
during the demodulation and parameter of the demodulator 
is adaptively corrected, there is a problem as clarified 
by the present inventors that operation of the operation 
section must be interrupted before the modulation system 
is settled. An object of the present invention is to 
provide signal demodulating and decoding technique that 
during signal reception in a MODEM or a communication 
apparatus having plural modulation systems, not by 
control from the upper processor, a modulation system 
can be settled rapidly and stably. Outline of a representative invention 
disclosed in the present patent application will be 
briefly described as follows. Demodulating means and decoding means are 
provided for demodulating and decoding operation 
depending upon plural modulation systems respectively, 
and operation means is provided for evaluating 
respective decision error amounts. Further, selection 
means for selecting respective decoding data using the 
evaluation results is provided, and selection means for  
 
selecting the decision error is provided when outputs of 
respective demodulating means are supplied to respective 
decoding means. According to the above-mentioned means, at 
first, when respective decision error amounts are 
evaluated in plural demodulating means, the modulation 
system in the demodulating means having the least 
decision error amount is the correct modulation system. 
Consequently, the decision error amounts of all 
demodulating means are always
