<ABSTRACT>
A composition for nasal administration of polar metabolites of opioid analgesics comprises a polar metabolite of an opioid analgesic and an absorption promoting agent. Preferred metabolites morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-6-sulphate. A preferred absorption promoting agent is chitosan but other suitable agents include cationic polymers, bioadhesive agents, surface active agents, fatty acids, chelating agents, mucolytic agents, cyclodextrin, microsphere preparations or combinations thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition for nasal
administration and more particularly to a composition for
the nasal administration of the polar metabolites of opioid
analgesics.Opioid analgesics have a useful role in pain relief,
particularly for patients in the terminal stages of cancer.
Morphine is a widely used agent and can be administered via
injection as an oral controlled release formulation or by
suppository. Morphine has also been given via the nasal
route and morphine snuff was described in the last century.The intranasal administration of opiates has been
discussed by Ralley (Can. J.Anaesth. 36, 5 491-493 (1989)
who suggested that morphine could be given by this route.
The route was relatively free of side effects normally
associated with opioids but a possible disadvantage was the
short duration of sedation which lasted only up to 60
minutes.Nasal administration of morphine is discussed in EP
205282 where a sustained release effect is achieved through
the use of a cellulosic derivative that adheres to the
mucosa. A solid unit dosage form is described. WO 8203768 describes a system for nasal drug delivery
comprising morphine or its analogues having at least one
phenolic hydroxy group with a non toxic nasal carrier.
Ointments, gel solution or suspension salts of morphine are
preferably used in the sustained release products.It is well known that the therapeutic use of morphine
gives rise to various side effects, including constipation
and respiratory depression. Recently it has been disclosed
that some of the metabolites of morphine, namely morphine-6-glucuronide
and morphine-6-sulphate may be several times
more active than the parent drug and is less likely to have
the unwanted side effects (Pasternak et al (1987) Life
Sciences 41, 2845; Hanna et al. (1991) Brit.J.Anaes. 66,
103; Brown et al (1985) J Pharm.Sci. 74,821). They may
also have a longer biological half-life. The use of
morphine-6-glucuronide as a drug substance in its own right
has been discussed in the pharmaceutical and medical
literature (Osborne et al (1988) Lancet April 6 p.828).
Similarly, morphine-6-sulphate has been described in the
literature as an analgesic agent (Brown et al Supra).
However, the major problem facing delivery of these agents
and polar metabolites of this and other opioid analgesics
by methods other than injection, is the high water
solubility of the compounds. It is unlikely that the
materials will be well absorbed acrosS mucosal surfaces,
for example from the gastrointestinal tract. It is
possible that
