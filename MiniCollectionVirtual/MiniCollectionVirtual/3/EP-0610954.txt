<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a conductor bundle for electrical installations, especially for complete housing installations and installation networks for electrical energy supply and its control as well as for transmission of news, data and information. Using this, it is intended to make it possible to obtain a conductor bundle for installations which is easy to install and both provides energy supply and can be used for transmission of news, data and information. The same is achieved with the aid of two main strands which are connected to each other by means of a continuously extending and detachable bridge connector. This bridge connector has a notch running over the entire length and on both sides, for the possible splitting, and for the deliberate insertion of nails when nail fastening is being used. The special shaping of the periphery of the main strand jackets provides the advantage that the bridge connector runs approximately parallel to the support face of the connector bundle, which facilitates the cable fastening.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical installation compound line comprising main strands (11, 12) connected by a 
breakable continuous web (13) for separate power supply, control and transmission of 

data wherein the web (13) and the thereby connected jackets (15) of the main strands 
(11, 12) are integrally formed and the web (13) is generally parallel oriented to the 

supporting surface of the compound line,
characterized in that
 
there are two main strands (11, 12), the web (13) having a notch (14) on both sides 

throughout its length for cutting and for directed guiding in case of mounting by nail 
and having a width sufficient to avoid damaging the main strands in case of mounting 

by nails, that the contouring of the circumference of the jackets (15) of the main 
strands (11, 12) is definded in such way that forming of a flat cable is avoided, that 

the jacket (15) of one (11) of the main strands has a circular circumference and the 
other main strand (12) has a generally oval circumference, and that the major axis of 

the oval circumference of one of the strands (12) is oriented generally vertically to the 
web (13).
