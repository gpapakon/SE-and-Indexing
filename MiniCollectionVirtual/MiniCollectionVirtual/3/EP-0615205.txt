<ABSTRACT>
An image information processing apparatus for 
processing image information includes a total curvature 

calculating unit, mean curvature calculating unit, a 
logical product computing unit and a median filter. A 

total curvature at each pixel of the image information 
is calculated by the total curvature calculating unit. 

A mean curvature at each pixel of the image information 
is calculated by the mean curvature calculating unit. 

The logical product computing unit executes computation 
of a logical product of outputs from the total 

curvature calculating unit and the mean curvature 
calculating unit. An output from the logical product 

computing unit is filtered by the median filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus and a recording/reproducing
apparatus and, more particularly, a
recording/reproducing apparatus for recording
information on a recording medium and reproducing the
recorded information as image information using a
signal obtained by a physical interaction between the
recording medium and a probe electrode upon
two-dimensional scanning of the probe electrode
relative to the recording medium, and an image
processing apparatus suitable for this
recording/reproducing apparatus.In recent years, the recording capacity of data
required for a recording/reproducing apparatus tends to
increase. To meet this increase, the size of the unit
of recording is reduced, and the density of the unit of
recording must be increased. For example, in a digital
audio disk using optical recording, the size of the
unit of recording is reduced to about 1 µm2.On the other hand, a scanning tunnel microscope
(STM) capable of allowing direct observation of the 
electron structure on or near the surface of a material
has been developed and has the following advantages, so
that a variety of applications are expected.
(1) A real spatial image can be measured at a
high resolution regardless of the monocrystalline and
amorphous materials.(2) A low-power observation can be performed
without damaging a recording medium by a current.(3) The microscope can be operated in an ultra
high vacuum, air, and a solution.(4) The microscope can be used for a variety of
materials.The scanning tunnel microscope utilizes the flow
of a tunnel current (i.e., a signal obtained by a
physical interaction between a probe electrode (metal
probe) and a conductive material) between the probe
electrode and the conductive material while a voltage
is kept applied between the probe electrode and the
conductive material. The tunnel current is very
sensitive to a change in distance between the probe
electrode and the conductive material. When the probe
electrode is two-dimensionally scanned relative to the
surface of the conductive material so as to keep the
average distance between the probe electrode and the
conductive material or the tunnel current constant,
thereby obtaining surface information of the real space
of the conductive material. At this time, the 
resolution in the longitudinal direction of the
conductive material is 10 nm or less.When the principle of this scanning tunnel
microscope is applied, a material (a thin film layer of
n electron organic compound or chalcogen compound)
having a memory
