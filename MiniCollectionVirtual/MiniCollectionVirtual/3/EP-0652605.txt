<ABSTRACT>
A female terminal fitting for a connector comprises: 
a cylindrical insertion portion whose front end is opened; 

and a resilient contact piece is disposed within the 
cylindrical insertion portion. The resilient contact piece 

includes: a first fold being formed by extending an extending 
end portion from a wall portion of the cylindrical insertion 

portion and folding the extending end portion back into a 
hollow of the cylindrical insertion portion, the first fold 

being given resiliency; a second fold being formed by further 
folding the extending end portion inward, the second fold 

being given resiliency; and a stopper for regulating an 
amount of flexion of the resilient contact piece, the stopper 

being formed by bending the extending end portion of the 
second fold so as to confront a back surface between the 

first fold and the second fold. A male terminal fitting is 
retained in pressure contact with the resilient contact piece 

by inserting the male terminal fitting into the cylindrical 
insertion portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector comprising
a male and a female terminal fitting, said female terminal
fitting having a cylindrical insertion portion whose front
end is opened and which can be connected to the mating male
terminal fitting by allowing the male terminal fitting to
be inserted into the cylindrical insertion portion.A connector adapted for use in connecting electrical
wires is designed to attach a male terminal fitting to one
of a pair of connectors to be connected to each other and a
female terminal fitting to the other, and to insert the
male terminal fitting to a cylindrical insertion portion of
the female terminal fitting formed by opening the front end
of the female terminal fitting, so that both male and female
terminal fittings can be connected to each other electrically.The female terminal fitting has a cylindrical insertion
portion formed by bending a metal strip in cylindrical form
and a fold formed by folding a part of the metal strip from
the front end opening of the cylindrical insertion portion
toward the hollow so as to depict a loose arc. A resilient
contact piece that is given resiliency is disposed on the
fold.One known example is a device shown in Figs. 3 and 4
which is disclosed in JP-A-63-26979, and another one
is shown in Fig. 5. Each of these female
terminal fittings 50 is constructed so that a resilient
contact piece 53 extends rearward by folding the slenderly
extending resilient contact piece 53 from the front
end opening 52 of a cylindrical insertion portion 51 into
the hollow, and causes a not shown male terminal fitting to
come in contact with the female terminal fitting by clamping
the male terminal fitting between the cylindrical insertion
portion 51 and an inner wall 54 thereof by resiliency
of the resilient contact piece 53. FR-A-2 415 890 discloses a female connector and according
to Figs. 2 and 5 of this document there is provided a
resilient contact piece with a first fold, a second fold
protruding out of the cylindrical portion and a stopper.
Said stopper is not for regulating the flexion of the resilient
contact piece such that an over-flexing of this
contact piece is prevented. Instead, upon insertion of a
male terminal the contact piece is pressed down and abutts
at the stopper, so that the cantilevered contact piece becomes
supported at two ends, i.e. by the stopper on the one
end and the fold at the other end, so that the elasticity
of the contact piece is decreased and the contact force is
increased. In other words, the contact piece

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising a male and a female terminal fitting, said female terminal
fitting comprising:


a cylindrical insertion portion (2) whose front end is open; and
a resilient contact piece (10) disposed within said cylindrical insertion portion (2), said
resilient contact piece including:


a first fold (11) being formed by extending an extending end portion from a wall
portion of said cylindrical insertion portion (2) and folding the extending end

portion back into a hollow of the cylindrical insertion portion, said first fold
(11) being given resiliency,
a second fold (14) being formed by further folding the extending end portion
inward, said second fold being given resiliency, and
a contact projection (13),

wherein said male terminal fitting (C) is retained in pressure contact with said resilient
contact piece (10) upon correct and complete insertion of said male terminal fitting

(C) into said cylindrical insertion portion (2),
characterized by

a stopper (16) regulating any excessive biasing force to an amount of flexion of said
resilient contact piece (10) within the limit of resiliency allowed by the first fold,

said stopper being formed by bending the extending end portion of said second fold
(14) so as to confront a back surface of said resilient contact piece (10) between

said first fold and said second fold, wherein

said contact projection (13) is provided between the portion confronting the stopper (16)
and the second fold (14), and wherein

said stopper (16) and said male terminal fitting (C) being dimensioned such that, upon
correct insertion of the male terminal fitting, resiliency is applied by both folds,

facilitating the male terminal fitting to be inserted at a small insertion pressure, and
ensuring highly reliable contact with high contact pressure once the male terminal

fitting has been inserted.
