<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of depositing a patterned 
thin layer for repairing a wiring disconnection of a liquid crystal 

wiring substrate (12). The method includes the steps of positioning a 
medium (15) in the vicinity of or in contact with the disconnection of 

the substrate (12), and radiating a laser beam to the medium (15) so 
that a material produced by a thermal decomposition of the medium 

(15) is stuck to the disconnection to form a patterned thin layer for 
repairing the disconnection. Since the method does not need the steps 

of applying a medium to a substrate, heating a substrate, and washing 
a substrate after a modification has been completed, all of these steps 

are required in conventional methods, it takes only 30 seconds per a 
repairing, whereas the conventional methods took about 5 minutes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of repairing a disconnection 
of wiring of a liquid crystal wiring substrate, and more particularly to 
such a method in which a patterned thin layer is formed on a 
disconnection to thereby repair a disconnection. One of known methods for forming a patterned thin layer for 
modifying a wiring of a liquid crystal wiring substrate includes the 
steps of applying a medium on a substrate, the medium precipitating a 
metal due to thermal decomposition thereof, and radiating laser beams 
to the medium in accordance with a desired modification pattern to 
thereby decompose the medium to precipitate a metal by which the 
wiring is modified. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 5,164,565 issued to 
Addiego et al. on November 17, 1992 has suggested a thin patterned 
layer forming method including the steps of discharging a solution in 
which a palladium acetate is dissolved in an organic solvent, through a 
thin nozzle of a dispenser onto a substrate to thereby partially form a 
palladium acetate layer on the substrate, heating the substrate to 
remove the solvent from the layer, and scanning laser beams in 
accordance with a desired modification pattern to thereby precipitate 
palladium on the substrate. In the aforementioned method, since the minimum width of 
the palladium acetate layer formed on the substrate is relatively 
wider, specifically about 200 micrometers, the method requires to 
include steps of washing out unnecessary palladium acetate, after a 
wiring has been formed, located in the vicinity of the wiring, and 
raising a temperature of the substrate for removing a solvent from the 
palladium acetate layer. Thus, the conventional method takes much 
time for modification of wiring, and has complicated steps, resulting  
 
in that the conventional method is not so practical in terms of a 
throughput when the method is to be applied to mass production such 
as a liquid crystal wiring substrate. In addition, in the aforementioned 
method, a substrate is strongly bonded to a palladium acetate due to 
the heating of the substrate carried out for removal of a solvent, and 
hence unnecessary palladium acetate often cannot be sufficiently 
removed in a step for washing the substrate to be carried out after the 
modification of a wiring. This causes a lowering of a modification 
yield. In view of the foregoing problems, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a method which does not require the 
washing step and solvent removing step as above mentioned to thereby 
rem
