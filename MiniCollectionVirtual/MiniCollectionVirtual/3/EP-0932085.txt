<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is aimed at carrying out
high-precision and stable image formation using a gray-level

image forming technique. In carrying out image
formation by a gray-level electrophotographic process,

the relationship between the layer thickness Tp of the
photosensitive layer on the photosensitive member and

the exposure diameter Db of a light beam emitted onto
the photosensitive member is defined as 2Tp 
<
 Db, so
that the charge diffusion and electric field in the

photosensitive layer on the photosensitive member can be
small. The maximum exposure within the exposure

diameter Db is set at a value that can sufficiently
reduce the differential sensitivity of the

photosensitive layer, where the exposure diameter Db of
the light beam is the minimum diameter at 1/e
2
 with
respect to the peak value of the exposure distribution

obtained by integrating the energy distribution of the
light beam with the exposure time. In this manner,

excellent gray-level image presentation can be obtained,
and high-precision and stable image formation can be

carried out by using a region of damping characteristics
on the photosensitive member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus and an image forming method suitable
for forming color images by a gray-level image forming
technique.In recent years, there has been an increasing
demand for high-precision reproducibility of image
information by a digital copying machine or a printing
machine which uses an electrophotographic technique. In
response to this demand, methods and techniques for
stabilizing image forming conditions or for realizing
more precise gray-level image presentation have been
developed.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 1-297269
discloses a method in which the amount of light
for black information recording by a light emitting
device which forms an electrostatic latent image on a
photosensitive member is set within the saturation range
of the damping characteristics of the photosensitive 
member. Within the saturation range, the potential of
the photosensitive member does not fluctuate greatly
along with a fluctuation of the amount of light of the
light emitting device. Thus, density unevenness due to
a fluctuation of the amount of light emitted from the
light emitting device can be prevented.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open NO. 4-25871
discloses a technique in which a high γ-photosensitive
member is employed, and the relationship
between the maximum light amount I0 of the beam amount
distribution on the high γ-photosensitive member and
the half exposure light amount P1/2 for reducing the
potential of the photosensitive member by half is
defined as: 1.2 × P1/2 ≦ I0 ≦ 2.5 × P1/2. By satisfying
the above conditions, clear image formation is carried
out regardless of fluctuations in sensitivity of the
photosensitive member.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 8-160677
also discloses an image forming process called a
simultaneous cleaning method or a cleanerless method, in
which the exposure intensity in the exposure process is
set in a predetermined range so that excellent image
formation can be obtained, though residual toners on the
photosensitive member are again charged and exposed. In
this manner, ghost images can be prevented, and high-resolution 
and excellent gray-level images can be
obtained.In the above Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 1-297269, 4-25871, and 8-160677, "saturation
write" is carried out to irradiate the photosensitive
member with light to form an electrostatic latent image,
and the amount of light is in the saturation range of
the photosensitive member. Thus, fluctuations in
exposure amount and
