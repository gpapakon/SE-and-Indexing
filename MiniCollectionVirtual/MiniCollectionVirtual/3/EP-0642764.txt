<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an optical 
obturator 12 which includes a sleeve 20 having a 

longitudinal bore between a proximal end and a distal end. 
The longitudinal bore 24 of the sleeve is configured to 

receive at least a portion of an endoscope or like image 
transferring system. An image passing member 28, such as an 

optical window is positioned at the distal end of the 
sleeve and is provided to permit optical images to pass 

into the longitudinal bore of the sleeve and to permit 
illumination light to pass to the surgical site. An 

automatically retracting blade 34 is positioned distal to 
the image passing member to facilitate penetration of body 

tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
penetrating and for observing penetration of body tissue. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
trocar assembly having an endoscope or laparoscope inserted 
therethrough to provide visual observation during 
penetration of the peritoneum or other body tissue. Endoscopic surgical procedures, that is, surgical 
procedures performed through tubular sleeves or cannulas, 
have been utilised for many years. Initially, endoscopic 
surgical procedures were primarily diagnostic in nature. 
More recently as endoscopic technology has advanced, 
surgeons are performing increasingly complex and innovative 
endoscopic surgical procedures. In endoscopic procedures, 
surgery is performed in any hollow viscus of the body 
through a small incision or through narrow endoscopic tubes 
(cannulas) inserted through small entrance wounds in the 
skin. In laparoscopic procedures surgery is performed in 
the interior of the abdomen. Laparoscopic procedures generally utilise 
instrumentation that is internally sealed to inhibit gases 
from entering or exiting the body through the laparoscopic 
or endoscopic incision. This is particularly true in 
surgical procedures in which the surgical region is 
insufflated. Moreover, laparoscopic and endoscopic 
procedures often require the surgeon to act on organs, 
tissues and vessels far removed from the incision, thereby  
 
requiring that any instruments to be used in such 
procedures be of sufficient size and length to permit 
remote operation. Typically, after the surgical region is 
insufflated, trocars are used to puncture the body cavity 
and include a cannula which remains in place for use during 
endoscopic procedures. Generally, trocars used during such 
procedures include a stylet having a sharp tip for 
penetrating the body cavity positioned coaxially within 
protective tubes to protect a patient or surgeon from 
inadvertent contact with the tip. An example of a known 
trocar is described in commonly assigned, U.S. Patent No. 
4,601,710 to Moll. Most currently used trocars rely on 
protective tubes or relative retraction of the tip to 
prevent inadvertent contact with tissue. The present invention provides an optical 
obturator apparatus for a trocar assembly, for observing 
the penetration of the peritoneum or other body portions. 
The trocar assembly of the present invention provides an 
improved window structure for passing optical images to an 
imaging system inserted into the optical obturator, 
which
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An optical obturator apparatus (10) for observation of 
body tissue during penetration, the apparatus 

comprising an obturator sleeve (20) having a proximal 
end and a distal end, said distal end having means for 

penetrating body tissue, wherein said penetrating 
means comprises a cutting blade (34); the apparatus 

further comprising: 

(a) an image-passing member forming a distal end 
surface of the apparatus, through which the body 

tissue can be observed during said penetration; and 
(b) means to move the cutting blade between a 
deployed penetration disposition and a non-deployed 

non-penetrating disposition; and 
(c) means positioned in said sleeve for removably 
receiving an endoscope to allow viewing through said 

image passing member. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, and further 
comprising first and second elongated reciprocating 

blade pusher rods (38, 40) connected to said blade for 
moving said blade between said deployed and non-deployed 

positions. 
The apparatus according to claims 1 or 2, wherein said 
receiving means comprises a longitudinal bore (24). 
The apparatus according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
said sleeve is configured and dimensioned for 

insertion through a cannula (14).  
 
The apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said blade is spring (44) biased to a 

non-deployed position. 
The apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, further comprising means (48) for 

automatically moving said blade to said non-deployed 
position. 
The apparatus according to claim 6, further comprising 
an actuating member (80) for moving said blade, 

wherein initial movement of said actuating member in a 
first direction moves said blade to said deployed 

position and further movement of said actuating member 
in said first direction moves said blade to said non-deployed 

position. 
The apparatus according to claim 7 as dependent on 
claim 2, further comprising a blad
e drive member (88) 
operatively connected to said blade pusher rods and 

wherein said actuating member comprises a trigger 
member (46) and a pivotable lever (80) operatively 

connected thereto, said pivotable lever configured to 
slide said blade drive member (88) to deploy said 

blade and to allow release of said blade drive member
