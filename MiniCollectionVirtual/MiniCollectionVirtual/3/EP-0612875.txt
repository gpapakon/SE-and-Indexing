<ABSTRACT>
The pattern-laying device contains a lay bar (10) with recesses (24) for guiding the warp threads (3), which is moved to and fro parallel to the weaving rotor by a drive device, in order to lay the warp threads (3) into shedding members on the weaving rotor. Each lay bar (10) is assigned to a guide rail (25) which is intended for deflecting the warp thread (3) to be laid and for aligning it with the recess (24), guiding the warp thread (3), of the lay bar (10). The lay bar (10) is thereby advantageously relieved substantially of the warp-thread tension and has to deflect the warp thread only parallel to the weaving rotor. The lay bar (10) can thus be of low-mass design.

An insertion device for a series-shed loom having a rotor 
(1), which is equipped with reeds (2) and shedding 

members and at which the warp threads (3) are guided over 
a predetermined angular region for shedding, which device 

comprises a number of laying bars (10) provided with 
recesses (24) for guiding the warp threads, and which are 

displaceable parallel to the axis of rotation of the 
rotor for the insertion of the warp threads into shedding 

high and low points, and a drive mechanism (12) to move 
the laying bars (10) to and fro and to insert the warp 

threads according to a programme into the shedding 
points,
characterised in that
 each laying bar (10, 37) is 
associated with a fixed guide bar (25, 31), which is 

intended to deflect the warp thread (3) to be inserted 
and to align it with the recess (24), guiding the warp 

thread (3), in the laying bar (10, 37). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the laying bar (10) comprises a 
substantially U-shaped profile,
and in that
 the recess (24) is constructed in the 
connecting portion (23). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the laying bar (37) comprises a 
substantially L-shaped profile,
and in that
 the recess (24) is constructed in the short 
limb (39). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the laying bar (10, 37) is disposed 
at the guide bar (25, 31) so that the portion (23, 39)  

 
comprising the recesses (24) is turned towards the rotor 

(1). 
A device according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the laying bar (10, 37) is slidably 
mounted at the guide bar (25, 31). 
A device according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the laying bar (10, 37) is mounted 
at the guide bar (25, 31) by means of rolling members 

(40). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the guide bar (25, 31) comprises at 
least one portion (28, 29, 34, 35) to deflect the warp 

thread (3). 
A device according to Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the guide bar (25, 51) comprises 
two portions (28, 29; 34, 35) to deflect the warp thread 

(3).
