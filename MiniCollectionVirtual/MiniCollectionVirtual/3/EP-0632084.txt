<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to linear copolymers of carbon monoxide
and an olefinically unsaturated compound and to a process for the
preparation thereof.EP-A-213671 discloses copolymers of carbon monoxide, ethene and
one or more other olefinically unsaturated monomers (A), said
copolymer consisting of units -CO-(C2H4)- and -CO-(A)- whereby the
units -CO-(C2H4)- and -CO-(A)- are randomly distributed along the
polymer chains. Hence, the copolymer disclosed is a linear
alternating copolymer of carbon monoxide on the one hand and ethene
or another olefinically unsaturated monomer A on the other hand. The
advantage of these polymers as compared to the high molecular weight
linear alternating copolymers of carbon monoxide with ethene
exclusively resides in a lower melting point, enabling the melt
processing of the polymer to take place at a lower temperature. This
lower processing temperature in return reduces decomposition and
discoloration of the polymer during processing. However, it is a
disadvantage that at least one other olefinically unsaturated
monomer beside ethene is necessary for preparing the polymers with
reduced melting point, so that the total number of olefinically
unsaturated monomers is at least two.The polymers known from EP-A-213671 have good mechanical
properties, especially at elevated temperature, and have therefore
utility as engineering polymers.US-A-2495286 and GB-A-1522942 disclose non-alternating
copolymers of carbon monoxide and an aliphatic monoolefin,
preferably ethene, prepared by using a free radical catalyst, thus
accomplishing a free radical polymerization of the said carbon
monoxide and aliphatic monoolefin. In the working examples of the
U.S. patent copolymers of carbon monoxide and ethene are described
having molar ratios ethene to carbon monoxide varying from as low as 
1.16:1 to as high as 20:1. The copolymers disclosed in said British
Patent Specification have a molar ratio ethene to carbon monoxide of
close to unity.The ethene/carbon monoxide copolymers described in US-A-2495286
and GB-A-1522942 have melting points which are lower than those of
corresponding perfectly alternating copolymers. However, it will be
appreciated by persons skilled in the art that said copolymers do
not have a linear structure but rather a branched one due to the
free radical polymerization mechanism. A drawback of polymers having
a branched structure is their relatively high melt viscosity and
that their melt processing may be seriously hampered. Moreover, well
known disadvantages of free
