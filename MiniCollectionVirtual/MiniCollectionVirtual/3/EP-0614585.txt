<ABSTRACT>
Method and unit for the reconstruction of the initial order of the sequence of the flow of the cells pertaining to the same virtual channel (VC) or path (VP) at the output of the ATM switching network with high priority cell control. The method is based upon the maximum delay equalization for the scheduling of the cells to transfer at the output, by using lists addressed by pointers and a shared queues approach for the management of the contentions by more cells for the same output time slot, so to obtain a significant saving of the memory space. The resequencing unit includes memories the dimensions of which depend upon the maximum number of cells being actually present in the resequencing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a unit for the 
reconstruction or resequencing of the initial order of the 
sequence of a cell flow in telecommunication systems using 
a special digital technique called ATM (Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode), for the transmission and/or switching of 
the vocal signals, video signals and data. In the ATM technique the information relating to the 
various users and services are organized as time contiguous 
units with a fixed length of approx. 400 bits called cells. 
The cell bits are subdivided into a field containing the 
information to be exchanged (payload) and into a heading 
field (header) containing the information requested to 
route the cell through the switching network and other 
service information. The ATM technique is considered as the more profitable 
solution for the multiplexing and switching into the 
evolution of the public communication networks towards the 
future wide band numerical network integrated in the 
services (B-ISDN), as this technique allows a very great 
flexibility compared to the previous systems. On an ATM link, in the same time, a certain number of 
connections can be active; they are called virtual channels 
(VC) and virtual paths (VP). A virtual channel is a logic 
association between the end points of a link that enables 
the unidirectional transfer of cells over that link, while 
a virtual path is a logic association of virtual channels 
between the end points of a link that enables the 
unidirectional transfer of cells belonging to a set of 
virtual channels to take place over that link (CCITT Rec. 
I.113).  
 At the ATM level the integrity of the cell sequence inside 
every VC/VP has to be preserved, i. e. the AT network must 
be able to supply at the output the cells belonging to the 
same VC/VP in the same sequence order with which they are 
sent to the network. The keeping of the sequencing order is automatically 
assured if all the cells in the same VC/VP follow the same 
path inside the ATM network. However, in the ATM switching nodes to perform the 
switching operation it should be suitable to free ourselves 
of the need to make the cells of a same VC/VP pass through 
the same path. In particular, in the ATM technique, a switching node 
consists (Fig. 1) of a switching network (SN) and of a 
certain number of exchange terminations (ET) to which the 
ATM links are connected. In the case under examination all the cells that belong to 
the same VC/VP are allowed to follow different paths inside 
the SN and as the cells
