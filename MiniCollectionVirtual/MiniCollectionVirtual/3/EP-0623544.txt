<ABSTRACT>
A combination of two cable drums consists of an outer cable drum which encloses an inner cable drum fastened to the drum shaft and is mounted in a freely rotatable manner on the drum shaft concentrically to the inner cable drum. The drum casing of the outer cable drum is provided with an axially running gap for the passage of a cable. Furthermore, a coupling is provided for the non-rotatable coupling of the working drum to the drum shaft. In order to store cable lengths required for heights of lift which are not needed without the stored cable being damaged by the cable wound up under load, the two cable drums are used as a working drum with storage drum in such a way that only the rope length required for the respective operating state is always wound onto the outer working drum, and, according to the requirement for changed operating states, rope lengths are transferred from the working drum to the inner storage drum or conversely are transferred from the latter to the outer working drum.
