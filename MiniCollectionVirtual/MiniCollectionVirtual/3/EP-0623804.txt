<ABSTRACT>
The height of a surface (25) along an axis (4) is determined by measuring 
the axial position of an irradiated spot (31) formed on the surface at the intersection of 

the surface and the axis. Radiation reflected by the surface and collected by a lens (8) 
forms an image spot (32) on the axis (4). The position of the image spot is determined 

by measuring the intensity of the radiation at at least three positions along the axis by 
means of a detection unit (35). The output signals (44, 44') of the detection unit are 

processed in an electronic means (43) for determining the position of the highest 
radiation intensity and for supplying a signal (43') whose magnitude represents the axial 

position of the image spot (32), hence, of the irradiated spot (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for optically measuring the height of a 
surface of an object, which device comprises a radiation source for generating an 
irradiating beam which is directed along a predetermined beam axis and forms an 
irradiated spot on the surface, and an imaging system for converging radiation from the 
irradiated spot to a radiation beam forming an image spot on the beam axis in the image 
space of the image system. Such a device is used, for example, to check whether a surface has the 
desired profile or whether a flat plate is actually flat and does not have any grooves or 
projections. The device may also be used to check whether holes and elevations are 
provided at the correct positions on a substrate plate and may further be used, for 
example, for inspecting electronic circuits comprising electrically insulating plates 
provided with conducting metal strips and electronic components. Another use of the 
device is focus-point detection. A device as described in the opening paragraph is known, inter alia, from 
the article "Optical Surface Microtopography Measurement and/or Automatic Focusing" 
published in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, July 1972, pages 504 
505. In this device a laser beam is focused by a lens system to form an irradiated spot 
on the surface of an object. Part of the radiation reflected by the surface is captured by 
the lens system and subsequently reflected out of the laser beam by a beam splitter. A 
further beam splitter forms two sub-beams from the reflected radiation beam. Each sub-beam 
comes to a focus, forming an image of the irradiated spot. The radiation in each 
sub-beam is measured by a detector with a pin hole aperture on the axis of the sub-beam 
and in front of the radiation-sensitive surface of the detector. In one sub-beam the 
pin hole is placed in the sub-beam before the image formed by the sub-beam, in the 
other sub-beam the pin hole is placed in the sub-beam behind the image formed by the 
other sub-beam. The output signals of the two detectors are fed to a differential 
amplifier. When the output signal of the differential amplifier is zero, both detectors 
receive an equal amount of radiation. Consequently, the two images must be equidistant  
 
to the respective pin holes. In other words, the focus or position of highest intensity of 
the image spot is midway between the two pin holes. A change in the height of the 
surface, causing a change in the position of the irradiated spot, leads to a change in the 
posi
