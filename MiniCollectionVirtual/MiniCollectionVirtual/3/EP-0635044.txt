<ABSTRACT>
In a system for the production of carbon black and hydrogen by the decomposition of hydrocarbon gas, there is in connection with the thermal decomposition reactor (1) provided a reactor (2) with adjustable temperature zones in order to influence and control the properties of the carbon black as well as to modify the surface and structure of the carbon black. The reactor has means for supplying gases and materials in the various temperature zones. Downstream of the reactor (2) there is provided a cooler (3) for the reactions products, in which feed gas and plasma gas can be preheated (19) and which is followed by separation means which may preferably consist of a cyclone (4, 5) for separating coarse particles from the carbon component. The cyclone (4, 5) is connected to a filter device (7) wherein carbon black of the desired particle size and structure is filtered out to a silo (8) and further processing. The system is equipped with a pipe for transfer of hydrogen partly to the chemical process industry, as an energy carrier, as well as back to the reactor (2) via a return pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the production of carbon black and 
hydrogen by the decomposition of hydrocarbons. From EP 0 315 442, EP 0 392 121, US 4 213 939 and GB 1 150 362 are known 
methods and systems for the production of carbon black by the incomplete 
combustion of a hydrocarbon in a gaseous form and/or a liquid form attended by 
the decomposition of a portion of the hydrocarbon by cracking. However, the 
main component of the gaseous byproducts are carbon oxides. From GB 1 492 346 is known a pyrolytic process for the production of carbon 
black by the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons in a reaction chamber. 
However, water vapour is introduced into the plasma stream of the gaseous heat 
carrier and the hydrocarbons are decomposed into carbon and gaseous byproducts 
of which hydrogen is only one component. A number of different systems and processes for the production of carbon black 
from hydrocarbon gases are known in the prior art. One group of these processes 
utilizes thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons into a carbon black and a 
hydrogen component by the use of a plasma torch. However, the methods used 
until now have usually only resulted in other gaseous hydrocarbon products, e.g. 
acetylene. Until now no system has been developed which has enabled a 
continuous production of carbon black and hydrogen to take place, since the 
earlier systems have had to be stopped after short operational periods due to the 
formation of deposits, so that the torches and reactors have had to be cleaned 
before the system could be put into operation again. These disadvantages have 
resulted in the systems being very expensive to operate with correspondingly 
high costs for the final products. A futher disadvantage with the known systems has been that they did not allow 
full control to be obtained of the final products, i.e. carbon black and hydrogen 
which were produced, since it has only been possible to produce a standard 
quality of carbon black with regard to physical properties, with the result that 
further processing of this product has had to be based on the carbon black 
obtained. The hydrogen has mainly been burned off.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for the production of 
carbon black and hydrogen by decomposition of hydrocarbon gas, which can be 
operated in a continuous process and where it is possible to preset the process 
conditions in such a way that a carbon black can be produced with predetermined 
physical properties. This object
