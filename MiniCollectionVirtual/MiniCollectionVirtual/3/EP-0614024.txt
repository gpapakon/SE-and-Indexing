<ABSTRACT>
Actuator for a disc brake, particularly for a floating-calliper disc brake, with an actuator shaft (8) which is arranged parallel to the plane of the brake disc and is supported on the side facing the brake disc, via a first contour (17) that describes a circular arc and is supported in a corresponding bearing shell, against a pressure piece that can be moved against the brake disc (2) and, on the side facing away from the brake disc, via a second contour eccentric with respect to the first contour (17), against an element (14) relative to which the pressure piece can be moved, characterised in that the second contour is made up of at least two circular arcs, the centres and radii of which are chosen so that the amount of movement of the pressure piece (9) relative to the actuator shaft and in a direction parallel to the plane of the brake disc during the rotation of the actuator shaft (8) is minimised.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping unit for a disc brake, especially a floating caliper disc brake, with a 
clamping shaft (8) installed in par el to the brake rotor, with its first machined 

contour (17) supported by a circular shaped bearing cup (19) within a thrust piece (9) 
which is movable against the brake disc (2), and on the opposite side of the brake 

disc with the eccentrically machined second contour (21) abutting an element (14) 
against which the thrust piece (9) is relative moveable, characterised by, the second 

machined contour (21) consisting of two circular shapes (I, II) whose centre (P
1
, P
2
) 
and radius (R
1
, R
2
) locations have been positioned so that the amount of movement of 
the thrust piece (9), relative to the clamping shaft (8) and in parallel direction of the 

brake disc surface, is minimised during rotation of the clamping shaft (8). 
Clamping unit according to claim 1., characterised by the adjoining circular shapes (I, 
II) of the second contour (21) becoming tangent at their mutual border line (B). 
Clamping unit according to claim 1. or 2., characterised by the second contour (21) 
being a cycloid. 
Clamping unit according to claim 1. or 2., characterised by the second contour (21) 
consisting of two circular shapes (I, II) with one being assigned the no-load stroke 

(α), and the other the power stroke (β). 
Clamping unit according to claim 4., characterised by the no-load stroke (α) circular 
shape (I) utilising a smaller radius (R
1
) than the other circular shape (II) assigned to 
the power stroke (β). 
Clamping unit according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by a pivot 
bearing (18) located between the first contour (17) and the bearing cup (19). 
Clamping unit according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by the 
second contour (21) being axially longer than the first contour (17). 
Clamping unit according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by the thrust 
piece (9) being supported in spherical guide ways (25) within the caliper housing (1). 
Clamping unit according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by a device 
(23) applying a pre-load in the release direction of the brake. 
Clamping unit, according to claim 9, characterised by the pre-load device utilising a 
compression spring (23) to pre-tension the thrust piece in the opposite direction of 

the brake disc.
