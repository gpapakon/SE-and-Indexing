<ABSTRACT>
Object: To provide a method of manufacturing a sealant
containing tire tube, which is capable of simply opening

a sealant filling hole without use of any specialized jig,
and a vulcanizing die therefor.
Solving Means: A vulcanizing die 30 includes an upper
die 30a, a lower die 30b, and a filling hole opening

device 50. The filling hole opening device 50 includes a
linear actuator 51, a drive shaft 52, and a cutter 53.

The lower die 30b has a cutter passage 32 which passes
through the vulcanizing die 30 from outside to inside,

and a cut piece recovery passage 33 which extends from
the outside of the vulcanizing die 30 to a portion, near

the inner opening end, of the cutter passage 32. The
drive shaft 52 of the linear actuator 51 is inserted in

the cutter passage 32, and the cutter 53 is fixed to one
end of the drive shaft 52.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a tire tube and a vulcanizing apparatus
therefor, and particularly to a method of manufacturing
a sealant containing tire tube including an air chamber
filled with air and a sealant chamber filled with a
sealant according to the preamble of claim 1, and a
vulcanizing apparatus therefor according to the preamble
of claim 3.Fig. 1 is a transverse sectional view of a wheel
mounted with a tube containing tire including a sealant
chamber. Referring to Fig. 1, a rim R of the wheel for a
motorcycle is connected to a hub (not shown) via wire
spokes (not shown).A tube containing tire T having a tire 1 and a tube
2 contained in the tire 1 is mounted on the rim R. The
tube 2 includes a peripheral wall 4 and a partition wall
5 for partitioning the inside surrounded by the
peripheral wall 4 into two parts. The peripheral wall 4 
is composed of an air chamber peripheral wall 41
positioned radially inward of the tube 2, and a sealant
chamber peripheral wall 40 positioned radially outward of
the tube 2. The partition wall 5 is molded integrally
with the peripheral wall 4.An air chamber 3, which is surrounded by the air
chamber peripheral wall 41 and the partition wall 5 in an
approximately circular shape in cross-section, is filled
with air. A sealant chamber 7, which is surrounded by the
sealant chamber peripheral wall 40 and the partition wall
5 in an approximately arcuate shape, is filled with a
known liquid sealant 8. The air chamber peripheral wall
41 has an air valve 6 for filling the air chamber 3 with
air.Fig. 4 shows manufacturing steps up to and
including the step of forming a tube raw material into a
tubular shape. Specifically, the above steps include a
material kneading step, a tube material extrusion-molding
step, a cutting step, an air valve mounting step, and a
joining step.A material composed of a crude rubber kneaded at 
the material kneading step is extrusion-molded into a
raw material tube 2' by an extrusion-molding machine at
the tube material extrusion-molding step. The raw
material tube 2' is cut into a specific length at the
cutting step; an air valve 6 is mounted at a suitable
position on the air chamber peripheral wall 41 at the
air valve mounting step; and both the ends of the raw
material tube 2' are joined to each other at the joining
step.The document EP-A-818302 discloses a method in accordance
with the preamble of claim 1 and an apparatus in accordance with the preamble of claim 3.At a vulcanizing die set step, as shown in Fig.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a sealant containing tire tube (2) which includes
an air chamber (3) filled with air and a sealant chamber (7) filled with a

sealant (8), said method comprising:

a first step of forming, by extrusion-molding, a raw material tube (2') in
which the inside of a peripheral wall (4) having an approximately circular

shape in cross-section is partitioned by a partition wall (5) into an air
chamber (3) and a sealant chamber (7);
a second step of joining both ends of the raw material tube (2') to each
other in an annular shape;
a third step of setting the annular raw material tube (2') in a vulcanizing die
(30);
a fourth step of heating the vulcanizing die (30), thereby vulcanizing the
raw material tube (2') to form a vulcanized material tube (2);
a fifth step of ejecting the vulcanized material tube (2) thus vulcanized from
the vulcanizing die (30);
a sixth step of filling the sealant chamber (7) with
a sealant (8) through a sealant filling hole (60); and
a seventh step of closing the sealant filling hole (60),
characterized in that
 at said third and fourth steps, the sealant filling hole
(60) communicating to the sealant chamber (7) is opened in the peripheral

wall (4) of the raw material tube (2') having been set in the vulcanizing die
(30).
A method of manufacturing a sealant containing tire tube (2) according to
claim 1, wherein at said sixth step, the sealant chamber (7) is filled with the

sealant (8) in a state in which the air chamber (3) is filled with air.
A vulcanizing apparatus for a sealant containing tire tube (2), which is
adapted to vulcanize a raw material tire tube (2') inserted in a specific die 

(30), said raw material tire tube (2') having a configuration in which the
inside of a peripheral wall (4) formed into an approximately circular shape in

cross-section is partitioned by a partition wall (5) into an outer peripheral
side sealant chamber (7) and an inner peripheral side air chamber (3),
characterized in that
 said apparatus comprises:

filling hole opening means (50) for opening a sealant filling hole (60)
communicating to the sealant chamber (7) by cutting off part (40a) of the

peripheral wall (4).
A vulcanizing apparatus for a sealant containing tire tube (2) according to
claim 3, further comprising a passage (33) through which the cut piece

(40a) of the peripheral wall (4) is removed.
