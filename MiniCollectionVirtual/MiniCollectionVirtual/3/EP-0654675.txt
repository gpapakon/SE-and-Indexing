<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic resonance apparatus includes a gantry (A) 
an incorporating a magnet (12) which generates a uniform 

magnetic field in a thin (typically under 15 cm thick) 
imaging volume (10). Gradient coils (30) and radio 

frequency coils (20) transmit radio frequency and 
gradient magnetic field pulses of conventional imaging 

sequences into the imaging volume. A patient support 
surface (42) moves a patient continuously through the 

imaging volume as the pulses of the magnetic resonance 
sequence are applied. A tachometer (52) monitors 

movement of the patient. A frequency scaler (54) scales 
the frequency of the RF excitation pulses applied by the 

transmitter (22) and the demodulation frequency of the 
receiver (26) in accordance with the patient movement 

such that the selected slice moves in synchrony with the 
patient through the imaging volume. The slice select 

gradient is indexed after magnetic resonance signals to 
generate a full set of views for reconstruction into a 

two-dimensional image representation of the slice are 
generated. The views for each slice are reconstructed 

(28) into a three-dimensional image representation that 
is stored in a memory (60). By using rapid imaging 

techniques, such as echo-planar techniques which can 
generate a two-dimensional image of a slice in 150 

milliseconds, a three-dimensional diagnostic image of a 
section of a subject one metre long can be generated in 

less than 2 minutes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic resonance apparatus comprising: a patient
receiving gantry having an axis and including a main magnetic field means
arranged to generate a main magnetic field which is uniform and temporally constant
within an examination volume, which volume is thin in a direction parallel to the axis of the
patient receiving gantry as compared to its extent in directions perpendicular to this axis;
the gantry further including a radio frequency coil separated from the main magnetic field means towards said axis and disposed around the
examination volume; the gantry further including a gradient coil assembly arranged to create gradient magnetic fields for
slice selection and read and phase encoding along orthogonal directions in the examination
volume; the apparatus comprising control means arranged to designate magnetic field gradient and radio frequency
pulses of a selected magnetic resonance imaging sequence; and a patient support and
transport means arranged to support and move the patient axially along the patient receiving
gantry. Such an apparatus is known from JP-A-63 272 335.The invention further relates to a corresponding method of magnetic resonance imaging.The invention finds particular application in conjunction with magnetic
resonance diagnostic imaging apparatus and methods and will be described with particular
reference thereto.In many medical diagnostic procedures, it is desirable or even necessary to
generate an image representation of a relatively large volume of the subject. In prior art
magnetic resonance imagers, the imaging volume is generally limited to a sphere within
which the primary magnetic field is temporally invariant and uniform. Prior art magnetic
resonance imaging systems typically have required a magnetic assembly with a patient
receiving bore that is at least 1.5 meters long in order to provide a uniform imaging volume 
of about 40 cm in diameter. One disadvantage of these systems is that very large magnets and
magnet assemblies are required. These very large magnet assemblies have several drawbacks
including their large size, immense weight, and high cost. Not only are the magnets
themselves expensive, but so is the large size related equipment for generating gradient magnetic
fields, RF pulses, and the like.Another disadvantage of the prior art magnetic resonance imagers is that they
can only image a limited portion of the subject. Whole body scans are not impossible.
Stretching the uniform magnetic field volume longitudinally adds significantly
