<ABSTRACT>
Space heating appliance of the radiant tube type, 
shown in Figure 1, has sheet metal or other shield 

formations (30) mounted in the tube (10) to extend 
downstream in the fan induced gas flow from side edges of 

the mouth (24) of a fluid fuelled burner head (22) which 
projects into the tube to feed hot gases into said flow 

so as to initially separate that infeed from the general 
flow along the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiant tube space heating appliances
of the kind comprising a radiation tube or duct, commonly suspended
overhead in the space to be heated, a fan or other pump for inducing
flow of gases along the duct in use, and one or more fluid fuelled
burner assemblies, typically gas fired and automatically controlled, for
feeding hot gases into said flow. Radiant heat is emitted from the
duct surface and this is commonly directed and concentrated, e.g. in
a downward direction, by reflectors mounted adjacent to the duct.
Said appliances are hereinafter referred to as "radiant tube heating
appliances".Examples of known constructions of radiant tube heating
appliance are described in EP-A-0248629 and in GB-A-2102555.The object of the invention is to provide improvements in
radiant tube heating appliances giving better efficiency, more reliable
operation, and, in particular, substantially reduced levels of noxious
emissions.According to the invention there is provided a radiant tube
heating appliance as distinguished by the characterising part of Claim
1 hereof.In a radiation duct of circular cross section where the burner 
head depends vertically into the duct the shield formations will lie on
spaced vertical chords of said cross section leaving segmental through
passages to either side.An example of the invention is now more particularly described
with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic longitudinal vertical section of part
of a radiant tube and burner assembly, andFigure 2 is a vertical sectional view on line 2-2 of Figure 1.The radiant tube space heating appliance of this example is an
installation for heating a large space such as a factory building or
public hall: the overall installation is generally of conventional type
comprising branched or other runs of circular section radiation
tube 10 through which hot gases provided by burner assemblies 14
are drawn by an exhaust fan leading to a discharge flue. The fan and
each burner assembly is controlled automatically in known manner.This example includes burner assemblies 14
of known construction and operation. Briefly each assembly comprises a
control unit 20 mounted externally above tube 10 and a burner head
22 which depends downwardly through a top opening in the tube and
has a rectangular burner mouth 24 on a vertical diametral plane of
tube 10 and directed downstream of the direction of flow through tube 
10 (from right to left as viewed in Figure 1). The longer axis of
mouth 24 is vertical
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A radiant tube space heating appliance comprising a radiation
tube (10), means for inducing flow of gases along the tube in use, and

at least one fluid fuelled burner assembly (14) for feeding hot gases
into said flow, said assembly including a burner head (22) mounted

in use to project laterally inwardly of the radiation tube into the path
of flow therethrough and having a burner mouth (24) at the front of

the head facing downstream of said path of flow whereby fuel mix is
operatively discharged along said flow for combustion in the tube

immediately downstream of the head, said burner mouth having a
pair of spaced parallel flat sides spaced laterally from the tube walls

to allow said flow of gases therepast; characterised in that the
appliance further includes shield means (30) operatively mounted

within the radiation tube with its upstream end adjoining or in close
proximity to at least each said side of the burner mouth and

extending downstream therefrom at least in a substantial part of the
zone in which said combustion takes place in use whereby the flow

of gases along the tube past the head is substantially separated from
the flow of fuel mix issuing from said mouth in said zone, said shield

means comprising a pair of substantially rectangular flat sheet shield
formations (30) mounted in spaced parallel relationship to extend

downstream from said flat sides of the burner mouth.
An appliance as in Claim 1 characterised in that said shield
formations (30) are stainless steel. 
An appliance as in Claim 1 or 2 characterised in that the tube

(10) is circular in cross section and said shield formations (30) lie on
spaced chords of said cross section leaving segmental through

passages to either side thereof.
An appliance as in Claim 1,2 or 3 characterised in that the
shield formations (30) have mounting means (32) operatively secured

to the tube (10) whereby the burner assembly (14) can be mounted
and dismounted independently of the shield means.
