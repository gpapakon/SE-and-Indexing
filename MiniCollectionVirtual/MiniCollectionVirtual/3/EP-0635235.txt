<ABSTRACT>
A cap (7) is placed over a hinge portion (6) such that 
the open end of a 

horizontally extending rod (13) extends towards the 
socket (14) extending into the 

seat (2) and cover (3). The cap (7) is moved towards the cover (3) 
and seat (2) to locate the 

rod (13) within the socket (14). The rod (13) of another 
portion (6) is also moved into 

the other end of the socket (14) such that the rods (13) 
extend along a common axis. 

Flanges (10) of the caps (7) slide between the ribs (8) of 
the base (5) until the flanges 

(10) are located just beneath the ribs (8). The cap (7) is 
then rotated to cause the 

flanges (10) to slide under the ribs (8) until the axially 
extending ribs (11) abut the 

correspondingly extending ribs (8) to prevent further 
rotation of the caps (7) in that 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hinge assembly for releasably
mounting a toilet seat and a method of mounting a toilet seat.FR-A-2 506 595 shows a toilet seat mounting in which a bolt is
connected to a hinge assembly and extends down through a part of the toilet
bowl with a wing nut being attached to the downwardly projecting part of the
bolt. In order to detach the hinge portion the base mounting has to be
released.AU-A-7 514 174 shows a hinge portion that is attached to the base of
a toilet by a bolt being tightened to cause a conical nut to be drawn upwardly
to wedge a slotted bush against an opening in the toilet bowl. To remove the
hinge portion the base mounting has to be released.EP-A-0 156 967 shows a hinge assembly for releasably mounting a
toilet seat on a toilet bowl, the hinge assembly comprising an exposed base
mounting attached to a toilet bowl and a hinge portion about which a toilet
seat moves, the hinge portion being arranged to be detachably mounted on the
exposed base mounting by causing turning movement of a retaining portion
that extends through the base mounting.According to one aspect of the present invention in a hinge assembly
for releasably mounting a toilet seat on a toilet bowl, the hinge assembly
comprises a base mounting arranged, in use, to be attached to a toilet bowl
and a hinge portion about which a toilet seat, in use, is arranged to move, the 
hinge portion being arranged to be detachably mounted on the base mounting
by causing turning movement of a retaining portion, characterised in that the
retaining portion is arranged to at least partially conceal the base mounting.By using turning of a retaining portion to detachably mount the hinge
portion on the base mounting an easily operable mechanism which provides
good resistance to forces attempting to move the hinge portion relative to the
base mounting in a number of directions is provided. Furthermore, the
problems associated with a push fit retaining member which must be stiff
enough to hold the parts in place and yet lose enough to enable detachment of
the parts may be avoided.
With such an assembly, when it is desired to clean the hinge
assembly, the hinge portion can be detached and cleaned and the base
mounting, which 
has been concealed and which is not at a convenient location for thorough
cleansing, will not require cleaning or will not require as thorough a cleaning
as would be the case if the base mounting had been exposed during use of the
toilet.The hinge portion may be arranged to be located in

<CLAIMS>
A hinge assembly (1) for releasably mounting a toilet seat (2) on a
toilet bowl (4), the hinge assembly (1) comprising a base mounting

(5) arranged, in use, to be attached to a toilet bowl (4) and a hinge portion (6)
about which a toilet seat (3), in use, is arranged to move, the hinge portion

(6) being arranged to be detachably mounted on the base mounting (5) by
causing turning movement of a retaining portion (7), characterised in that the

retaining portion (7) is arranged to at least partially conceal the base mounting
(5).
An assembly as claimed in Claim 1, in which the hinge portion (6) is
arranged to be located in position relative to the base mounting (5) by causing

downwards movement of the hinge portion (6) relative to the base mounting
(5).
An assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, in which the hinge assembly
(1) is arranged to be connected to a base.
An assembly as claimed in any preceding Claim, in which the retaining
portion (7) is arranged to surround the base mounting (5) when the hinge

portion (6) is mounted on the base mounting (5).
An assembly as claimed in any preceding Claim, in which the retaining
portion (7) and the hinge portion (6) are arranged to substantially cover the

base mounting (5). 
An assembly as claimed in any preceding Claim, in which the hinge
portion (6) is arranged to project upwardly through an opening in the retaining

portion (7).
An assembly as claimed in any preceding Claim, in which the retaining
portion (7) is arranged to be connected with the base mounting (5) by means

of cooperating screw threads.
An assembly as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6, in which the retaining
portion (7) is arranged to coope
rate with the base mounting (5) by pivotal
movement of the retaining portion (7) relative to the base mounting (5), with such pivotal

movement being arranged to occur without any relative translational
movement.
An assembly as claimed in any preceding Claim, in which the hinge
portion (6) is pivotally movable relative to the retaining portion (7) before the

hinge portion (6) is connected to the base mounting (5).
An assembly as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 8, in which the hinge
portion (6) is pivotally movable relative to the retaining portion (7) when the

hinge portion (6) is connected to the base mounting (5).
An assembly as claimed in any preceding Claim, in which the location
of the base mounting (5) is arranged to be adjustable relative to the bowl (4)

in at least one relative translational direction. 
An assembly as claimed in any of Claims 3 to 11, in which the base
mounting (5) is arranged to occupy one of a plurality of rotational positions

relative to the base for a given position of extent of the hinge axis.
A method of mounting a toilet seat (2) on a toilet bowl (4) in order that
the seat (2) can hinge relative to the bowl (4), comprising attaching a base

mounting (5) of a hinge assembly (1) on a toilet bowl (4), and locating a
hinge portion (6) of the hinge assembly (1) to cooperate with the seat (2), and

detachably mounting the hinge portion (6) on the base mounting (5) by
