<DESCRIPTION>
 TETRAVALENT TITANIUM ELECTROLYTE AND TRIVALENT TITANIUM REDUCING AGENT OBTAINED THEREBYTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a liquid electrolyte which can be used for carrying out chemical reductions. More particularly, the invention is concerned with a methanesulfonic catholyte containing a tetravalent salt of titanium which is dissolved in a methanesulfonic acid solution. The invention is also directed to an electrochemical process including the catholyte of the invention, an electrolyte process for the reduction of tetravalent titanium into trivalent titanium as well as the simultaneous oxidation of the reduced form of redox couple, when used as a reductant for organic molecules such as nitrobenzenes, sulfoxides or quinones. Finally, the invention pertains to improved methods for the reduction of chemical compounds using a solution of trivalent titanium in methanesulfonic acid. BACKGROUND ARTRedox reagents are compounds that can exist in an oxidized or reduced state. Usually, these compounds are transition metals such as iron, chromium, manganese, vanadium, etc. Great use has been made of these compounds in organic synthesis for the oxidation or reduction of reactive groups. Examples include the oxidation of methyl groups to aldehydes or acids, introduction of quinone groups to aromatic ring systems, the reduction of nitro groups to amines and the addition of hydrogen to unsaturated molecules. The manufacture of anthraquinone from the chromic acid oxidation of anthracene, withSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

subsequent re-oxidation of the chromic acid in an electrochemical cell is such an example. Such processes were used in the dyestuff industry in Germany as early as the turn of the century. Other processes involved the use of regenerated chromic acid to bleach montan wax, and the use of chromic acid to manufacture saccharine. Examples of using regenerated redox reagents abound in the literature of electrochemical synthesis. In some cases the redox reagents were added along with the organic substrate and the whole treated in an electrochemical cell. This is known as in-cell reaction. In other cases, the reagent was prepared electrochemically in solution, mixed with the organic substrate in a separate treatment, to so- called ex-cell method. This application concerns this latter approach.Regardless of which system of redox manipulation is involved, the role of the redox reagent is to react easily and efficiently with the electrode on the one hand and the normally insoluble organic substrate on the
