<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nucleotide sequences encoding a
plant enzyme, vectors containing said nucleotide
sequences, transgenic plants containing said nucleotide
sequences, recombinant DNA methods of producing the
enzyme, and methods of altering the properties of a
plant.Fruit and vegetable cell walls are largely polysaccharide,
the major components being pectin, cellulose and
xyloglucan (reference 1). Numerous cell wall models have
been proposed which attempt to incorporate the essential
properties of strength and flexibility (references
2,3,4).Xyloglucans are 1,4-beta-glucans that are extensively
substituted with alpha-1,6-xylosyl side chains, some of
which are 1,2 beta-galactosylated. They are found in
large amounts in the primary cell walls of dicots but also
in certain seeds, where they serve different roles.Primary cell wall xyloglucan is fucosylated. It is
tightly hydrogen bonded to cellulose microfibrils and
requires concentrated alkali or strong swelling agents to 
release it. Xyloglucan is thought to form cross-bridges
between cellulose microfibrils, the cellulose/xyloglucan
network forming the major load-bearing/elastic network of
the wall. DCB mutated suspension culture cells (cell
walls lacking cellulose) release xyloglucan into their
media, suggesting that xyloglucan is normally tightly
bound to cellulose.Hydrolysis of primary cell wall xyloglucan has been
demonstrated in segments of dark grown squash hypocotyls,
during IAA induced growth (reference 15). Endohydrolysis
of wall xyloglucan is thought to contribute to wall
loosening which accompanies cell expansion (reference 16).
The average molecular weight of xyloglucan has also been
shown to decrease during tomato fruit ripening and this
may contribute to the tissue softening which accompanies
the ripening process (reference 17).Certain seeds, e.g. nasturtium, contain up to 30% by
weight of xyloglucan, stored in thickened cotyledonary
cell walls, which serves as a reserve polysaccharide and
is rapidly depolymerised during germination.An endo 1,4 beta-D glucanase which specifically acts on
xyloglucan (i.e. a xyloglucanase) has been isolated and
purified to apparent homogeneity from germinating
nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) seeds (reference 11).The purified xyloglucanase gives a single polypeptide band
on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, (apparent
molecular weight, 29-31kDa) and isoelectric focusing
(isoelectric point, 5.0). The enzyme displays an absolute
specificity for xyloglucan and an endo mode of action, as
determined by
