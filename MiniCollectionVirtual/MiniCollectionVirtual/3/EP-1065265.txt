<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a germicidal detergent
composition. The term "germicidal" in the present invention
may mean bactericidal, sporicidal, sterilizing, germ-eliminating,
pasteurizing, disinfectant, microbicidal, germ-(,
bacterium-, fungus-, bacillus-, microorganism or the like)
lethal or the like. That is, the present invention can be
applied to germs, bacteria, spores, funguses, microbes,
microorganisms and so on.Killing and sterilizing a microorganism such as a germ
are a big subject in various fields including a medical cure
and a food industry, and many proposals concerning them have
been carried out already. For example, in JP-A 62-63504, a
germicide composition containing a cationic surfactant, an
inorganic peroxide and an activator for the inorganic peroxide
is disclosed; in JP-A 3-131700, a detergent composition for
a drainpipe having its germ-eliminating and/or germicidal
effect and containing each of an inorganic peroxide, a nonionic 
surfactant and tetraacetylethylenediamine in a specific
proportion is disclosed; and, in JP-A 8-502047, use of an
aqueous solution containing an aliphatic peracid and the
corresponding aliphatic acid in a specific molar ratio and
containing hydrogen peroxide as a germicidal detergent is
disclosed.Especially, in the case of a medical instrument and a
furnishing used in a hospital, a protective institution and
so on, it is necessary to fully carry out the germicidal
deterging treatment from the viewpoint of prevention of
infection and the like in the hospital and so on. There have
been known various germicides and disinfectants using
benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine gluconate, an iodine
compound, an alcohol, a hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde,
peracetic acid, etc.Examples of the germicidal deterging treatment using
glutaraldehyde and/or peracetic acid include that, in case of
a germicidal deterging of an endoscope, a sterilizing
treatment is carried out by means of glutaraldehyde and/or
peracetic acid after a primary disinfection using a germicide
of a quaternary ammonium salt type, an alcohol, a super-oxidized
water, an amphoteric surfactant, etc. and/or a
deterging step using an enzyme preparation, a neutral
detergent, etc. and, if necessary, a disinfection in an 
autoclave and/or a dry sterilization by heat is carried out.However, the above-mentioned treatment takes so long
time, therefore there has been a demand for further reduction
and simplification of the steps. At that time, it is necessary
that a reliable germicidal effect is obtained.
