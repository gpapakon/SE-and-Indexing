<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic engine apparatus (10, 100, 3000) and method that converts pulsed electromagnetic energy into mechanical force and motion. A reciprocating piston (50), (103, 104), (304, 305) in a cylinder chamber (51), (101a, 101b), (301c, 303c) acts on a fluid (Fn) that is responsive to the pulsed electromagnetic energy. The cylinder chamber (51), (101a, 101b), (301c, 303c) acts on a fluid (Fn) that is responsive to the pulsed electromagnetic energy. The cylinder chamber (51), (101a, 101b), (301c, 303c) is provided with check-valved input and output ports (CV1-CV4), (CV1-CVB), (CV-CV4) which are hydraulically coupled to a hydraulic motor (640). The piston (50), (103, 104), (304, 305) has embedded permanent magnets (56), (PM1, PM2), (PMa, PMb) that coact with the pulsating electromagnets (EM1, EM2), (200, 300), (700, 800, 900) to produce the reciprocating action (A1, A2), (A11, A22), (Aa, Ar). The piston permanent magnet (56), (PM1, PM2), (PMa, PMb) has protruding ends (56a, 56b), (103b, 104b), (702, 802) which are received within central bore portions (CRa, CRb), (CR11, CR22a), (701, 801) of core members (CR1, CR2), (CR11, CR22), (CRx, CRy) of the electromagnets (EM1, EM2), (200, 200), (700, 800) for producing increased magnetic pull.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROMAGNETICALLY POWERED HYDRAULIC ENGINE APPARATUS AND METHOD TECHNICAL FIELD:This invention relates to engine apparatus and 5 methods for producing work at an output thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to electrically powered engine apparatus and method of producing work at an output thereof. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to10 electromagnetical ly powered apparatus that produce work at an output thereof by means of combining electromagnet devices and hydraulic devices to produce work useful in propulsion of vehicles and other power input dependent apparatus.15 BACKGROUND ART:The principles of work are considered well known to the artisan as they relate to rectilinear and rotary motion of an object, suffice it to say that it concerns the transference of energy produced by the motion of an20 object by application of a force and is measured by the product of the force and displacement of the object. The internal combustion engine is a known apparatus employed to perform work by cranking a crankshaft. The advantage to mankind in having the internal combustion25 engine, is without question, superior to other tools developed by man to manage the daily tasks of living, including the electric motor whose rotor equates to the crankshaft in performing work. The internal combustion engine has had much research attention and has been30 perfected to yield great satisfaction in work efficiency, torque and speed. But, while the advantages are recognized by all, the polluting disadvantages to the environment have been largely ignored to the detriment of society. Electric motors Î¹i-35 have replaced many machine application formerly relying on the internal combustion engines, and while they have also enjoyed much technological advances, they have not been perfected to the point of replacing the greatest 

source of pollution, namely the automobile engine, (see Wall Street Journal Article entitled: "GM Says It Plans an Electric Car, but Details Are Spotty", page Bl , dated Thursday April 19, 1990) . The internal combustion engine requires timely firing of a spark within a cylinder chamber having gone through a compression stroke to produce the power stroke that moves a piston/rod in a re iproca ing manner to drive a crankshaft having a power output attachment. The end-use apparatus of the power output attachment are many, and include the automobile which has required many engine variations and cylinder block configurations to harness the energy produced at the crankshaft
