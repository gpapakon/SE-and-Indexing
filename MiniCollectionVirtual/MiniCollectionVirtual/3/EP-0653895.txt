<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an identity authentication method 
suitable for mobile radio applications, to a telephone set and to a 

security unit designed to implement the method. 
The basic idea consists in providing for at least one 
authentication key to be supplied by the user itself and not through 

information stored in the terminal or in one extractable module 
of it, and further in that the user has complete and exclusive control 

over it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an identity authetication 
method suitable for mobile applications, to a telephone set and 
to a security unit both designed to implement the method. In mobile systems, the problem of security is strongly felt from 
one side to assure confidentiality of transmitted data (often 
speech signals) and, from the other side, to assure a correct 
call charging, i.e. to avoid fraudulent use. As to the second aspect, the Future Public Land Mobile 
Telecommunication System (FPLMTS) individuates three entities:
 
the user, the terminal, the service supplier; each of these 
entities must at first identify itself and then authenticate its 
identity. The authentication procedure provided for is based upon 
challenge/response protocols using authentication keys; these are 
stored in a User Identity Module (UIM) for user authentication, 
in the terminal for terminal authentication, and in the 
telecommunication network or exchange for the service supplier 
authentication; the UIM is, e.g., a magnetic or electronic card. 
The theft of the terminal and/or UIM anyway leads to possible 
fraudulent use. It is an object of the present invention to make a further 
contribution to the security problem solution. This object is achieved through the identity authentication 
method having the feature set forth in claim 1, and through the  
 
telephone set and the security unit having the features set forth 
in claims 4 and 6 respectively; further advantageous aspects of 
the present invention are set forth in the subclaims. The invention is based on the underlying idea that consists in 
providing for at least one authentication key be supplied by the 
user itself and not through information stored in the terminal or 
in an extractable module of its, and that further the user have 
complete and exclusive control on it. The invention will result better from the following description. The method in accordance with the present invention is realized 
through a telephone set provided with a push-button dial, e.g., 
whenever the telephone set is activated or prior to every call. Naturally, prior to the identity authentication step, a step of 
identity declaration is necessary; moreover, also a step of 
service request could be necessary, sooner or later, in that 
circumstance in which the services available are numerous and 
selectively authorized; at the end of such steps the terminal 
will be enabled for the required service if the declared identity 
is correct. The present method provides for the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Identity authentication method based upon the sending, by a 
telephone subset provided with a keyboard, of at least one 

first authentication key constituted by a sequence of 
numerals, characterized in that the numbers of said sequence 

are determined on the basis of data received from said 
keyboard. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that, owing to 
the sending of said first key, said set realized the sending 

of a second key structurally similar to said first key and 
whose numerals are determined on the basis of data received 

from said keyboard, having the function of modifying said 
first authentication key. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that, owing to 
the sending of said second key, said set realizes the sending 

of a third key structurally similar to said first key and 
whose numerals are determined on the basis of data received 

from said keyboard, having the function of confirming said 
second authentication key. 
Telephone set comprising a push-button dial, storage means 
for storing at least one first authentication key and 

transmission means connected with said storage means for 
sending their content in an authentication step, 

characterized in that said storage means are connected with 
said dial for their filling up. 
Telephone set according to claim 4, wherein said storage 
means are designed to store a second and a third 

 
authentication keys. 
Security unit for enabling the supply telecommunication 
services to a plurality of users, comprising a control unit 

for receiving maintenance commands and enable requests, and a 
database having a record for each user of said plurality 

composed by at least a first and a second fields, said first 
field being designed to store the identity of the 

corresponding user, and said second field being designed to 
store an identity authentication key, characterized in that 

said control unit is designed to modify the content of the 
second field of one of said records upon receipt of an enable 

request. 
Security unit according to claim 6, characterized in that 
said control unit is designed to assign a pre-established 

value to the content of the second field of a selected 
record, upon receipt of a maintenance command. 
Security unit according to claim 6, characterized in that 
said control unit is capable of not outputting the content of 

the second field of said database records, neither on the 
basis of a maintenance command nor on the basis of an enable 

request. 
Telecommunication exchange comprising a security unit 

according to one of the claims 6 to 8. 
Telecommunication network comprising at least one security 
unit according to one of claims 6 to 8.
