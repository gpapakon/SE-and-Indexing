<ABSTRACT>
A displacement detecting apparatus for detecting a displacement 
between an object lens thereof and a measured surface in a non-contact 

manner. The displacement detecting apparatus comprises an 
object lens for focusing laser beam on the measured surface. A 

detecting optical system is provided to detect a focus error signal 
which represents a difference between a distance of the object lens 

from the measured surface and a focal distance of the object lens, in 
accordance with a reflected light from the measured surface. An 

actuator is provided to move the object lens in an optical axis in a 
manner to cause the object lens distance to coincide with the focal 

distance, in accordance with all output signal from the detecting 
optical system. A moving body includes a linear scale or a scale head 

and movable with the object lens. The linear scale is disposed coaxial 
with the optical axis and connected to the actuator. A support member 

is provided to movably support the moving body. Additionally, a 
balance weight is connected to the moving body in a manner that the 

center of gravity of the moving body coincides with the center of 
driving force of said actuator and with the center of support of the 

support member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a displacement
detecting apparatus in accordance with the generic clause of claim 1, and more particularly to a displacement detecting
apparatus for detecting a displacement between an object lens and a
measured surface in a non-contact manner by using an optical
astigmatism method.Such a displacement detecting apparatus is already known from document DE-A-4 219 311, which also
shows a sensor with a linear scale and moving means for moving the sensor
More specifically, this document shows an arrangement in which the center of a movable coil is
generally coincident with the optical axis of an object lens.A variety of methods such as an optical astigmatism method, a
critical angle detecting method and a knife-edge method have been
proposed and put into practical use to measure the displacement
between an object lens and a measured surface, the shape of an object,
and the surface roughness of the object. Such methods are
accomplished, for example, with a non-contact type surface roughness
tester which is arranged to measure a displacement in accordance
with an absolute level of a focus error signal, and a focus-adjusting
type non-contact displacement detecting apparatus which is provided
at its object lens with a driving system as a mover and arranged to
caused the object lens to follow the measured surface under feedback-control
of a focus error signal, and then to detect a displacement
between the object lens and the measured surface in accordance with
a signal from the driving system as the mover.The above-discussed displacement detecting apparatuses are
adapted to measure the surface roughness or a fine contour of the
measured surface. During a measurement operation of such
apparatuses, the upper limit of a measuring speed for the measured
surface is decided by a response frequency of the mover of the
apparatus, and therefore raising the resonance frequency of the
mover is required. In order to raise the resonance frequency of the
mover, it is effective to minimize the longitudinal dimension of the
mover, to shape the mover so as to have a high rigidity, to form the
mover of a material having a high modulus of longitudinal elasticity
and to raise the rigidity of a support member for the mover.Furthermore, the above-discussed displacement detecting
apparatuses are used to measure the fine deformation and surface  
roughness of a base plate or the like, and therefore they are required
to be small in size. In this regard, the mover for moving the object
lens during detection of
