<ABSTRACT>
The toboggan (1) proposed has a device which adjusts the runners  (3a, 3b) to allow the toboggan to negotiate curves, the adjustment being made in such a way that the radius of curvature of the runners (3a, 3b) is the same as the radius of the curve to be negotiated.

<CLAIMS>
A sled with runners (3a, 3b), wherein said runners (3a, 3b) are deformable by
means of adjusting means (12, 14, 19, 21, 23) for steering said sled (1), and

with a steering member (5) acting on said adjusting means, characterized by
an automatic braking means (29, 31, 33), which when the steering member

(5) is unrestrained will automatically force a braking member (29) down
against a runway (35) for said sled.
The sled (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that said runners (3a, 3b)
are mounted in the front and rear portions of a body (13) of said sled on both

sides thereof, and said adjusting means act laterally on said runners (3a, 3b)
between front and rear hinges (9a, 9b; 10a, 10b) respectively in such a

manner that in dependence on the desired steering direction said runners are
resiliently curved to one side or the other and the radius of curvature of said

runners is adjustable to correspond to the radius of the corner to be turned by
said sled (1).
The sled (1) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by a steering member,
consisting of a pivoted lever (5) and being connected to said adjusting

means, pivotally moveable laterally with respect to a longitudiual axis of said
sled to cause said runners (3a, 3b) to be deformed by said adjusting means

(12, 14, 19, 21, 23).
The sled according to claims 2 and 3, characterized in that said steering
member (5) acts on an, especially spring biased, force-transmitting means

(25) actuating said braking member (29). 
The sled according to claims 3 or 4, characterized In that said steering
member (5) is mounted on a shaft (14), which extends in said longitudinal

direction of said sled and comprises a first rigidly connected
orce-transmitting means (19); which by means of a second force-transmitting

means (21, 23) effect the lateral deformation of said two runners (3a, 3b).
The sled according to claim 5; characterized in that said second
force-transmitting means (21, 23) comprise a force-transmitting linkage (23),

which is connected to said runners (3a 3b), and a resilient clamp (21), by
which said first force-transmitting means (19) being rigidly connected to said

shaft (14) is resiliently clamped in such a manner that it (19) can rotate in
said clamp (21) and convert a rotary movement of said shaft (14) without a

backlash to a linear movement of said linkage (23).
The sled according to claims 5 or 6, characterized in that said steering
member (5) consisting of said pivoted lever is mounted pivotally in the

longitudinal direction of said sled on said shaft (14) preferably until it
completely rests on a seat (16) of said sled to preferably enable a slip over

or a transport on a car's roof.
The sled according to claims 4 and 7, characterized in that said steering
member (5) consisting of said pivoted lever has a force engagement (27) f
or
said force-transmitting means (25) of said breaking member (29), forming a

lever arm being spaced from its hinge at said shaft (14).
The sled according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized by said seat (16)
having a semi-circular cross section.
