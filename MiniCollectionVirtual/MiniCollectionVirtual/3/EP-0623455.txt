<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a press for the compaction of material 8, in particular waste, by a ram (press plate) 2 which can be displaced in a chamber 1 and is driven by at least one piston/cylinder unit 3 which is located to the side of the chamber 1 and is retracted in its initial position, in which the material 8 has not yet been compacted, and is extended in the end position, in which the material has been compacted to the maximum extent, the cylinder 4, in the initial position, being located parallel to, and to the side of, the path in which the ram moves, and the ram 2 or a ram support 10 being fastened at the cylinder end 4a at which the piston rod 6 emerges.

A press for the compaction of material (8), more particularly 
waste, by a plunger (press plate) (2) which is displaceable in a 

chamber (1) and is driven by at least one cylinder-and-piston 
unit (3) which is disposed laterally of the chamber (1) and is 

retracted in its starting position, in which the material (8) has 
not yet been compacted and the cylinders lie parallel with and 

laterally of the path over which the plunger moves, and is 
extruded in the end position, in which the material is compacted 

to the maximum extent, characterized in that the plunger (2) or a 
plunger support (10) is attached to that end (4a) of the cylinder 

at which the piston rod (6) emerges. 
A press according to claim 2, characterized in that one end 
(4a) of the cylinder is situated at the level of the plunger 

position which the plunger (2) occupies in its starting position, 
and the other end (4b) of the cylinder is situated at the level 

of the plunger position which the plunger occupies in its end 
position. 
A press according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
plunger (2) has cross support (10) which is attached to the 

cylinder-and-piston units (3), more particularly to the cylinders 
(4), and bears at least one cylinder-and-piston unit (9) to which 

the plunger pressing surface is attached, so that the plunger can 
be moved further in the compaction chamber (1).  

 
A press according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each cylinder has a guide on its exterior. 
A press according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
cylinder guide is formed by a tube which encloses the cylinder 

coaxially and into which the cylinder is furthest introduced in 
its final pressing position. 
A press according to claim 5, characterized in that the guide 
tube extends substantially over the height of the machine, its 

upper half being formed with a slot for the plunger-attaching 
member. 
A press according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pressure lines leading into the 

cylinder-and-piston unit extend through the inside of the piston 
rod. 
A press according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
pressure lines are bores in the piston rod. 
A press according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
pressure lines are lines of hoses or tubes extending inside the 

piston rod. 
A press according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a hydraulic line is disposed in the hollow 

piston rod (6) and the space, more particularly of annular cross-section, 
between the exterior of the hydraulic line and the  

 
interior of the piston rod inner wall is used as a further 

hydraulic line. 
A press according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that disposed in the chamber (1) is a further 

plunger (2a) operating oppositely to the pressing direction of 
the first plunger (2), so that the material lies between the two 

plungers, (2, 2a). 
A press according to claim 10, characterized in that 
attached to the cylinder-and-piston unit (3), more particularly 

to the cylinder (4), is a cross element (13) through each of 
whose ends an attaching element is attached which is connected to 

the plunger/press plate (2), each attaching element sliding in 
its own slot (15) in the chamber wall (19). 
A press according to one of claims 10 to 12, characterized 
in that the two attaching elements (12) cooperate with the 

plunger/press plate (2) to form a U-shaped rigid element. 
A press according to one of claims 10 to 13, characterized 
in that a roller (14) which runs in the slot (15) is mounted on 

the attaching element (12). 
A press according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pressure lines leading to the cylinders 

(9) are constructed telescopic.  
 
A press according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the cylinder-and-piston units are 

vertically adjustable and preferably the plunger (press plate) is 
attached to the cylinder at a distance from the upper cylinder 

end. 
A press according to claim 16, characterized in that for 
raising the cylinder-and-piston unit the upwardly lengthened 

piston rods have threadings, more particularly buttress 
threadings, to each of which an internally threaded wheel is 

screwed, all the wheels being drivable synchronously, more 
particularly by a chain.
