<ABSTRACT>
A stent for angioplasty has a body (1) in the form of a
generally tubular envelope susceptible of being dilated in use

from a radially-contracted position into a radially-expanded
position. The body of the stent (1) includes a plurality of

successive segments (2) having a serpentine shape with loop
parts having sequentially-opposite concavity. These loop

parts are connected by connector parts (4) and the bridges (3)
which connect the segments (2) of 
the stent together join to
the aforesaid connector parts (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally concerns so-called stents for
angioplasty.This term is intended to indicate in general those devices
intended for endoluminal application (for example, in a blood
vessel), usually effected by means of catheterisation, with
subsequent deployment in place so as to achieve local support
of the lumen. The primary purpose of this is to eliminate and
avoid the restenosis of the treated area. It is moreover
noted that it has already been proposed in the art to use
substantially similar structures in order to achieve the
deployment and anchorage in situ of vascular grafts:
naturally, this possible extension of the field of application
is also to be understood as being included within the scope of
the invention.For a general review of vascular stents, reference may
usefully be made to the work "Textbook of Interventional
Cardiology" edited by Eric J Topol, W.B. Saunders Company,
1994 and, in particular, to section IV of volume II, entitled
"Coronary Stenting".Many patent documents have addressed this issue as shown, for
example, by US-A-4 776 337, US-A-4 800 882, US-A-4 907 336,
US-A-4 886 062, US-A-4 830 003, US-A-4 856 516, US-A-4 768
507, US-A-4 503 569 and EP-A-0 201 466. Additional documents
of interest for the invention are DE-U-297 02 671 (after
which the preamble of Claim 1 was patterned), DE-U-297 01 758,
WO-A-96/03092, as well as WO-A-97/33534 and WO-A-98/33546,
the two last-cited documents falling under the provisions of Art.54(3)EPC. 
Notwithstanding the extensive research and experimentation, as
documented at the patent level, only a relatively small number
of operative solutions have, until now, found practical
application.This is due to various factors, among which the following
problems or requirements may be mentioned:
ensuring that, while moving towards the treatment
site, the stent is capable of adapting with sufficient
malleability to the path taken, even as regards less curved
sections such as those which may exist, for example, in some
peripheral vessels; all of this without detrimentally
affecting the ability of the stent to provide an effective
support action once positioned and deployed;avoiding, or at least limiting, the longitudinal
shortening effect which occurs in many stents on deployment, achieving the maximum homogeneity and uniformity in
the expansion movement, avoiding (when this is not a required
effect) a situation in which this movement manifests itself to
an extent and at times which vary in different areas or
sections of the stent;providing

<CLAIMS>
A stent for angioplasty including a body (1)
in the form of generally tubular envelope capable of

being dilated from a radially-contracted position to
a radially-expanded position, wherein


the said body includes a plurality of
circumferentially extending annular segments (2)

successively arranged along the longitudinal axis of
the stent, said segments having a serpentine-like

shape with opposite loop parts in sequence; the said
loop parts being connected by intermediate connector

parts (4) and being opposite in phase to each other
in the sequence of said successive segments,
the said successive segments (2) are connected to
each other by bridge elements (3) corresponding

substantially to a general V-shape and having,
between adjacent segments (2) successively arranged

along the longitudinal axis of the stent, an
alternating concave-convex profile including a V-shaped

portion,

   
characterised in that
 said bridge elements are
joined to the aforesaid intermediate connector parts (4).
A stent according to Claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the said bridge elements (3) have an
inflected median portion.
A stent according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,

characterised in that
 the said bridge elements (3)
are convex in the same direction along the

circumference of the stent. 
A stent according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised
in that
 the said bridge elements (3) have opposite, sequential
convexity along the circumference of the stent.
A stent according to any preceding claim 
characterised
in that
:

when the stent (1) is in the radially-contracted
position, the said intermediate connector parts (4) extend in a generally

longitudinal direction (z) with respect to the stent (1); and
the said bridge elements (3) have end parts (3a)
which, when the stent (1) is in the radially-contracted

position, extend in a transverse direction with respect to the
stent (1) itself.
A stent according to any of the preceding Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the said intermediate connector parts (4) extend in
a generally oblique direction with respect to the longitudinal

axis of the stent (1) and are substantially unchanged
following the dilatation of the stent (1) from the said

radially-contracted position to the said radially-expanded
position.
A stent according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
said bridge elements (3) have end parts (3a) joined to the

said intermediate connector parts (4) in a generally oblique direction with
respect to the longitudinal axis of the stent (1), these also

being substantially unchanged following the dilatation of the
stent (1) from the said radially-contracted position to the

said radially-expanded position. 
A stent according to any of Claims 1, 6 or 7,

characterised in that
 to at least some of the said intermediate connector
parts (4) are joined associated pairs of bridge, elements (3)

connecting successive segments (2) in the said plurality in a
general cross-shape.
A stent according to any preceding claim, 
characterised
in that
, in the said radially-contracted position, the said
loop parts have apex parts (2a) which extend along an

approximately lobe-shape path.
