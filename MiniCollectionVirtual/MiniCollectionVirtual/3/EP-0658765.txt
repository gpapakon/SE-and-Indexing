<ABSTRACT>
In the case of gas exchange in insulating glazing, by which the air at first present in the insulating glazing is replaced by a gas which is denser than air, the time at which the denser gas has displaced the air from the insulating glazing is established by producing an acoustic oscillation of essentially constant wavelength in the gas flow leaving the insulating glazing and observing the drop in the tone pitch which occurs as soon as the oscillation occurs in the denser gas instead of in air.

Method for determining the point in time at which a gas different from air,
having a specific weight higher than air and being introduced into an

insulating-glass pane filled with air, at a first position thereof, has
displaced the air from said insulating-glass pane through an opening

located at a second position of said insulating-glass pane,
characterized
 by the steps of producing in the gas flow, that leaves the
insulating-glass pane, an acoustic vibration of substantially constant

wavelength, and observing the drop in pitch encountered as soon as the
vibration occurs no longer in air, but rather in the gas of higher specific

weight.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the introduction of
the gas of higher specific weight is ended as soon as the pitch has

stabilized at its lower level.
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the gas is
displaced through an acoustic cavity resonator, whereby the vibration is

excited in the latter's gas fill.
Method according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the gas displaced
from the insulating-glass pane is passed through a whistle.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that
the gas is introduced into the insulating-glass pane at its bottom, and the

air is displaced through an opening at its top.
Device for carrying out the method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 by a conduit (5), which carries on its one end 
connection means for connecting said conduit (5) with an opening

through which the air is displaced and which is located at said second
position of said insulating-glass pane, the other end of said conduit (5)

opening into an acoustic cavity resonator (6), which latter is designed in
such a way that the gas flow produces an acoustic vibration of

substantially constant wavelength.
Device according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in that the cavity resonator
is a whistle (6).
Device according to claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterized
 in that a
microphone (13) is provided whose output is connected to the input
 of a
frequency-evaluation circuit (14).
Device according to claim 7 and claim 8, 
characterized
 in that said
whistle (6) is arranged in a chamber (2), which is lined with a sound-absorbing

material (17) and which also contains said microphone (13).
Device according to claim 9, 
characterized
 in that said sound-absorbing
material (17) contained in said chamber (12) is rock wool.
Device according to one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterized
 in that the
natural frequency of said cavity resonator (6) can be varied by means of

a mechanical regulating element (8. 9).
Device according to one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterized
 in that the
cavity resonator (6) is tuned to an audible natural frequency in air of at

least 1000 Hz.
Device according to one of claim 12, 
characterized
 in that the cavity
resonator (6) is tuned to an audible natural frequency in air of at least

1500 Hz.
