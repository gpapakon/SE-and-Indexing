<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention concerns the use of fatty acids in combination with maleic hydrazide to achieve excellent control of tobacco suckers on topped plants. The control of suckers is achieved at low rates of maleic hydrazide, thereby reducing maleic hydrazide residues on harvested tobacco.

<DESCRIPTION>
To achieve optimal production from a tobacco crop, growers commonly decapitate 
("top") their plants in order to obtain leaves with desired physical properties and chemical 
composition. The topping process involves removing the stem apex, including flowers and some 
top leaves, near the stage of plant maturity to stimulate the development of the remaining leaves. 
Current practice frequently involves topping tobacco plants in the "button" stage, soon after the 
floral part of the plant begins to appear. As a result of the topping process, tobacco plants 
produce axillary buds, or "suckers," which must be controlled in order to produce the most 
desirable tobacco plant. These suckers have to be continuously removed to achieve the purpose 
of topping. When tobacco plants are not topped for about three weeks after reaching the button 
stage, yields can be reduced by about 20-25 lbs/acreâ€•about 1%. In the past, the removal of suckers has been carried out by hand, which is a laborious and 
time-consuming process. Certain chemical growth-agents have been suggested and are now used 
by many tobacco growers to achieve economical control of suckers. While some of these 
chemicals provide adequate inhibition of sucker development and are in commercial use, some 
chemicals cause a variety of metabolic changes in the tobacco plant and result in leaves of 
undesirable quality. In addition, there has been some question of undesirable residues of chemical 
agents in the leaf tissue. One chemical compound which is extensively used for sucker control in tobacco plants 
is maleic hydrazide. The use of this compound is particularly common with flue-cured tobacco. 
Flue-curing is a procedure which is widely used by tobacco growers in the United States wherein 
heat is applied to the tobacco leaves as a part of the curing process. Fatty alcohols are also 
extensively used in sucker control programs. As described below, contact agents such as the fatty 
alcohols are used in an initial stage of sucker control, followed by treatment with a systemic agent 
such as maleic hydrazide. Typical procedures for reducing or preventing sucker growth in topped tobacco plants 
include about 2 to 3 initial treatments with contact agents followed by application of a systemic 
compound such as maleic hydrazide. As this name implies, contact agents reduce sucker growth 
by inhibiting the suckers with which these agents come into contact. This direct action on the 
vegetation is in contrast to systemic products, such as maleic hydrazide, which
