<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of cleaning articles that 
contain an epoxy resin. In particular, it relates to a method of 
removing undesirable synthetic and natural resins from those 
articles without dissolving the epoxy resin. In the electronics industry, circuit boards are used that 
are made from epoxy resins. When components are mounted on the 
boards, rosins used as solder fluxes contaminate the surfaces of 
the board. Other synthetic and natural resins are used as 
adhesives, and they also end up as undesirable substances on the 
board. In addition, the board can be contaminated by human 
contact and by particles and gases from the air. In order to 
preserve the electrical properties of the board, it is necessary 
to remove these contaminants without damaging the board itself. 
This is accomplished by cleaning the board with a solvent that 
readily dissolves most synthetic and natural resins, but does not 
dissolve or attack the epoxy resin from which the board is 
constructed. Until recently, trichlorotrifluoroethane was used for this 
purpose because it is a good solvent for most resins but does not 
attack epoxy resins. However, trichlorotrifluoroethane persists 
in the atmosphere and has been implicated in the depletion of the 
ozone layer. For this reason, its use has been restricted and it 
may be prohibited entirely within a few years. Efforts are being  
 
made to identify other solvents with the same desirable 
properties but which will not affect the ozone layer. I have discovered that certain chlorinated benzotrifluoride 
compounds are, like trichlorotrifluoroethane, good solvents for 
many natural and synthetic resins, yet are very poor solvents for 
epoxies. This was an unexpected discovery because aromatic 
compounds are usually very good solvents and chlorinated aromatic 
compounds are especially good solvents. Thus, it was surprising 
to find that these compounds do not dissolve epoxy resins. However, unlike trichlorotrifluoroethane, the chlorinated 
benzotrifluoride compounds of this invention are not expected to 
attack the ozone layer. Because about two years are required for 
a solvent released on the ground to reach the ozone layer in the 
stratosphere, and the solvents of this invention have an 
atmospheric life in the troposphere of only about sixty days, 
they should not be ozone depleters. The solvents used in the process of this invention have the 
general formula: 
  
 
where n is 1 or 2. Monochlorobenzotrifluoride compounds (n = 1) 
are preferred for applications

<CLAIMS>
A method of removing synthetic and natural resins from an 
article containing an epoxy resin without damage to said 

epoxy resin comprising 

(A) contacting the said article with a solvent having the 
formula 


 
where n is 1 or 2, to dissolve said synthetic and 

natural resins into said solvent and form a solution 
thereof; and 
(B) separating said solution from said article. 
A method according to Claim 1 including the additional last 
step of recovering said solvent from said solution. 
A method according to Claim 2 when said solvent is recovered 
by evaporating said solvent using heat, a vacuum, or both 

heat and a vacuum. 
A method according to Claim 2 wherein said recovered solvent 
is recycled to step (A).

inhibitor is ethyl morpholine. 
A method of cleaning an article made from an epoxy resin 
which is contaminated with another resin comprising  

 

(A) placing said article in a treatment chamber; 
(B) washing said article in said treatment chamber with a 
liquid solvent having the formula 


 
where n is 1 or 2; 
(C) transporting solvent used in said treatment chamber to 
a solvent recovery chamber; 
(D) vaporizing said solvent in said solvent recovery 
chamber; 
(E) transporting said solvent vapors to a condenser; and
