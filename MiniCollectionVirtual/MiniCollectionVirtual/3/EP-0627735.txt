<ABSTRACT>
By virtue of an integration of the functions of a known first optical system for light spot formation and of a second optical system for light spot scanning in just one optical system, a concentric double-mirror arrangement (12, 13) is used bidirectionally in that a light spot in line form imaged by the double-mirror arrangement (12, 13) on the Kerr coating of a magneto-optical transducer (15) is generated as a virtual image of a punctiform light source by a cylindrical mirror (11) and a first planar mirror (14), and a reflection light spot reflected by the Kerr coating is imaged on a photo-electric transducer (20) by a second planar mirror (17), the double-mirror arrangement (12, 13) and a third planar mirror (18). the concave mirror (12), the convex mirror (13), the three planar mirrors (14, 17, 18) and the cylindrical mirror (11) are reflecting surfaces of a one-piece, optically transparent carrier, to which a magneto-optical transducer (15) is connected. The field of applications relates to optical recording and/or playback equipment.
