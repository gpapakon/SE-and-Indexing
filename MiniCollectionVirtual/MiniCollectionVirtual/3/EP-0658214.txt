<ABSTRACT>
The application discloses a process for upgrading a titaniferous material by removal of impurities contained in the material especially radionuclides. The process involves heating the titaniferous material to a temperature of less than 1300  C to form a solid titaniferous phase and a liquid oxide or glassy phase in the presence of a material that promotes the formations of such phases, cooling the product at a rate that maintains the glassy phase in an amorphous state and leaching the solidified material with an acid or an alkali to remove the impurities. Materials that promote the formation of the desired phases include compounds of alkali metals and boron. Examples include borax, caustic soda, soda ash and silica.

<DESCRIPTION>
 UPGRADING TITANIFEROUS MATERIALSThis invention relates to the removal of impurities from naturally occurring and synthetic titaniferous materials. The invention is particularly suited to the enhancement of titaniferous materials used in the production of titanium metal and titanium dioxide pigments by means of industrial chlorination systems.Embodiments of the present invention have the common feature of roasting of titaniferous materials in the presence of additives and at temperatures which encourage the formation of a liquid oxide or glassy phase, followed at some stage by cooling and aqueous leaching as steps in an integrated process. Additional steps may be employed as will be described below.In industrial chlorination processes titanium dioxide bearing feedstocks are fed with coke to chlorinators of various designs (fluidised bed, shaft, molten salt), operated to a maximum temperature in the range 700 - 1200C. The most common type of industrial chlorinator is of the fluidised bed design. Gaseous chlorine is passed through the titania and carbon bearing charge, converting titanium dioxide to titanium tetrachloride gas, which is then removed in the exit gas stream and condensed to liquid titanium tetrachloride for further purification and processing. 

The chlorination process as conducted in industrial chlorinators is well suited to the conversion of pure titanium dioxide feedstocks to titanium tetrachloride. However, most other inputs (i.e. impurities in feedstocks) cause difficulties which greatly complicate either the chlorination process itself or the subsequent stages of condensation and purification and disposal of waste. The attached table provides an indication of the types of problems encountered. In addition, each unit of inputs which does not enter products contributes substantially to the generation of wastes for treatment and disposal. Some inputs (e.g. particular metals, radioactives) result in waste classifications which may require specialist disposal in monitored repositories.Preferred inputs to chlorination are therefore high grade materials, with the mineral rutile (at 95-96% TiO_) the most suitable of present feeds. Shortages of rutile have led to the development of other feedstocks formed by upgrading naturally occurring ilmenite (at 40-60% Ti02) , such as titaniferous slag (approximately 86% Ti02) and synthetic rutile (variously 92-95% TiO_) . These upgrading processes have had iron removal as a primary focus, but have extended to removal of magnesium, manganese and alkali
