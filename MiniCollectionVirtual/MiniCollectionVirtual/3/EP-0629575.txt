<ABSTRACT>
A thread-transport device for textile machines and particularly for the feed of the weft thread of weaving machines, preferably automatic ribbon weaving machines, has a thread draw-off roller (1), over the cylindrical surface (3) of which the thread (4) to be drawn off is guided frictionally. The driving rotational speed of the thread draw-off roller (1) is adjusted continuously via at least one regulating disc (2) having an axially narrowing working surface (10) and via a friction wheel (7) running on this working surface (10). In order to make it easier to set the correct thread-transport speed, the narrowing working surface (10) of the regulating disc (2) has approximately the contour of a parabola. The working surface (10) preferably narrows with a (concave) contour curved inwards towards the regulating disc (2).

Yarn transport device for textile machines, 
especially for feeding the weft yarn of weaving machines, 

preferably ribbon weaving machines, with a yarn draw-off 
roller, over the outer surface of which the yarn to be 

drawn off is guided frictionally and the rotational 
driving speed of which can be adjusted continuously via 

at least one regulating disc having an axially tapering 
working surface and via a friction wheel running on this 

working surface, characterized in that the working 
surface (10) of the regulating disc (2) and consequently 

the bearing diameter of the frictional bearing of the 
friction wheel (7) on the regulating disc (2) is designed 

to be tapered in such a way that any axial change in 
position of predetermined magnitude (ΔL) between friction 

wheel (7) and regulating disc (2) results in an always 
identical ratio between the bearing diameters (R
2
', R
1
'; 
R

) before and after the change in position (ΔL). 
Yarn transport device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the working surface (10) tapers 

with a contour which is curved concavely relative to the 
regulating disc (2). 
Yarn transport device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the outer surface 

(3) of the yarn draw-off roller (1) is of cylindrical 
design, and the yarn (4) is looped several times around 

the said outer surface. 
Yarn transport device according to Claim 3, 
characterized by a yarn guide pin (6) which extends with  

 
a slight clearance along the cylindrical outer surface 

(3) of the yarn guide roller (1) and over which the yarn 
(4) is guided several times. 
Yarn transport device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the yarn guide pin (6) runs at an 

inclination relative to the longitudinal axis (21) of the 
yarn draw-off roller (1). 
Yarn transport device according to Claim 4 or 
Claim 5, characterized in that the yarn guide pin (6) is 

arranged in a stationary manner. 
Yarn transport device according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the yarn guide pin (6) is fastened 

to the stationary shaft (21) of the yarn draw-off roller 
(1). 
Yarn transport device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that yarn draw-off 

roller (1) and regulating disc (2) are composed of a one-piece 
basic body (19). 
Yarn transport device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the regulating 

disc (2) is mounted rotatably on the end of a lever (13) 
which, by means of a threaded bush (16) provided with an 

internal thread, is arranged axially adjustably on a 
stationary threaded spindle (17) and so as to be pivotable 

about the threaded spindle (17), the threaded bush 
(16) consisting of plastic in order to increase the 

friction between internal thread and threaded spindle 
(17).
