<ABSTRACT>
It includes a closure tongue (50) articulated on a sole plate (10) and a clasp (closure) (20) for permitting locking of the closure tongue (50) on the sole plate (10), the said clasp being of the type including, projecting from the sole plate (10), a pair of lateral manoeuvring tabs (21A, 21B), each including a locking arm (30A, 30B) with a hook (36A, 36B), the said locking arms (30A, 30B) facing each other and partially overlapping. According to the invention, provision is made for means for improving opening of this type of clasp. Thus, a manoeuvring arm (38) is provided at the rear of the clasp which extends from the rear edge of one of the lateral manoeuvring tabs (21B) and which faces the other lateral manoeuvring tab. Moreover, the locking arms (30A, 30B) are shaped so as to have surfaces which are either inclined or rounded and convex, forming expulsion ramps.

A hair slide fitting of the kind comprising a closure tongue
portion (50) pivotably mounted on a base portion (10) and a clasp (20)

to permit locking of the closure tongue portion (50) on to the base
portion (10), said clasp comprising in projecting relationship on the

base portion a pair of lateral actuating lugs (21A, 21B) each comprising
a locking arm (30A, 30B) with a hook (36A, 36B), said locking arms (30A,

30B) being directed towards each other and partially overlapping each
other, characterised in that there is also provided a rear actuating arm

(38) extending from the rear edge of one of the lateral actuating lugs
(21B) and directed towards the other lateral actuating lug (21A).
A fitting according to claim 1 characterised in that a rear
actuating tongue portion (43) extends from the upper edge of said rear

actuating arm (38) in the direction of the rear end (14) of the base
portion (10) and in parallel relationship to the latter.
A fitting according to claim 2 characterised in that a rear
actuating arm (39) is also provided from the rear edge of the other

lateral actuating lug (21A), the two rear actuating arms (38, 39) at
least partially overlapping.
A fitting according to claim 3 characterised in that the rear
actuating arm (39) and the lateral lug (21A) to which it is attached

form an angle greater than or equal to 90Â°.
A fitting according to either one of claims 3 and 4
characterised in that said rear actuating arm (39) comprises a

projection (46) disposed beneath said rear actuating lug (43).
A fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised
in that said hooks (36A, 36B) are disposed in mutually facing

relationship so as to permit latching engagement between them of a
terminal lug (52) disposed at the end of the closure tongue portion

(50). 
A fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised
in that said hooks (36A, 36B) are directed in mutually opposite

relationship and are capable of co-operating with a cut-out provided in
the terminal part of the closure tongue portion (50).
A fitting according to claim 6 characterised in that said
locking arms (30A, 30B) comprise a cut-out having an inclined edge (33A,

33B), a central edge (37A, 37B) and a lock finger (35A, 35B) which
extends in a general direction parallel to the bent edge (32A, 32B) of

the corresponding lateral lug with a head forming a hook (36A, 36B),
said inclined edge (33A, 33B) forming a sloping expulsion surface.
A fitting according to claim 6 characterised in that said
locking arms (30A, 30B) comprise a cut-out having a convex rounded edge,

a substantially horizontal central edge and a lock finger which extends
in a general direction parallel to the bent edge (32A, 32B) of the

corresponding lateral lug with a head forming a hook, said convex
rounded edge forming a sloping expulsion surface.
A fitting according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that said actuating arms (38, 39) are disposed as far

away as possible from the zone in which the bottoms of the corresponding
lateral actuating lugs (21A, 21B) are joined to the base portion (10).
A fitting according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it is formed in one piece and produced solely by

bending operations.
A fitting according to claim 6 characterised in that the
external longitudinal edges of said closure tongue portion (50) are also

adapted to co-operate with two surfaces (33A, 33B) which are either
inclined or which are convex rounded and which are provided in said

locking arms (30A, 30B) facing said hooks (36A, 36B), forming sloping
expulsion surfaces. 
A fitting according to claim 12 characterised in that the
locking arms (30A, 30B) are of
 a generally U-shaped configuration, one
of the limbs of the U-shape being a lock finger (35A, 35B) bearing at

its end a hook (36A, 36B) which is directed towards the other limb of
the U-shape which has facing the hook (36A, 36B) an edge (33A, 33B)

which is either inclined or convex rounded forming said sloping
expulsion surface (33A, 33B).
A fitting according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the lateral actuating lugs (21A, 21B) comprise an

opening (22A, 22B) either in their zone of bending to the base portion
(10) or thereabove.
A fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised
in that the lateral actuating lugs (21A, 21B) are of a substantially L-shaped

configuration so oriented that one of the terminal parts of the
L-shape (27) extends towards the front of the clasp (20) while the other

terminal part of the L-shape constitutes a displaced foot (28A, 28B)
disposed towards the rear of the clasp.
