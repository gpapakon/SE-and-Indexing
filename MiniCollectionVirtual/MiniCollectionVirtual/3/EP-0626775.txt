<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to an improved voltage synthesis 
tuning system with digital memory, in particular for a 

television transmissions receiver, wherein a plurality of 
digital codes, each respectively identifying a television 

channel, are memorised in a digital tuning memory, to a 
corresponding plurality of addresses, with an automatic tuning 

circuit, and with means for modifying the respective digital 
code, in the presence of frequency drift phenomenons, exceeding 

the pull-in range of such automatic tuning circuit; the main 
characteristic of the invention consists in that the system 

searches the television station modifying the digital tuning 
code and simultaneously verifying the presence of a station 

identification signal; and that the exact tuning is obtained 
verifying a high slope signal coming from the automatic tuning 

circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an improved voltage synthesis 
tuning system with digital memory, in particular for a 
television transmissions receiver, wherein a plurality of 
digital codes, each respectively identifying a television 
channel, are memorised in a digital tuning memory, to a 
corresponding plurality of addresses, with an automatic tuning 
circuit, and with means for modifying the respective digital 
code, in the presence of frequency drift phenomenons, exceeding 
the pull-in range of such automatic tuning circuit. Television transmissions receivers utilising voltage synthesis 
tuning systems are known, for example as that described in the 
English patent N. 1 520 849. In such patent a system wherein a plurality of digital codes is 
described, each respectively identifying a television channel, 
memorised in a digital tuning memory, to a corresponding 
plurality of addresses. At the moment of carrying out the tuning, the digital code 
relative to the desired channel is read from the memory, is 
converted to an analogous value, and the corresponding voltage 
to such value is applied to the tuner, that is of the normal 
type having a controlled voltage oscillator (V.C.O). It is known that voltage synthesis systems are subject to drift  
 
phenomenons, due to for example temperature variations, or to 
the ageing of components; such phenomenons cause the tuning to 
no longer be (in fact never be) exact. For this reason generally such systems provide a so-called 
automatic tuning circuit (A.F.C.); however such circuits have to 
be sized based on a compromise; it is in fact known that the 
slope, or the precision, of the AFC circuit is inversely 
proportional to the pull-in range; as a result, for presenting 
an acceptable precision such circuits cannot have an excessively 
wide pull-in range; unfortunately drifts generally exceed such 
range, therefore it has been proposed to remedy such drawback. 
It is known, for example from English patent N. 1 518 712, to 
memorise a modified digital code, in place of the original, 
whenever a tuning discrepancy is revealed being greater than an 
established acceptable limit. If however a channel is not selected for a long period of time, 
it may occur that, at the moment of the selection, the drift 
results in being greater than the pull-in range and the tuning 
results in being impossible. For overcoming this drawback, the cited English patent N. 1 520 
849 provides that, upon the act of the tuning operation, it is 
detected if found to be outside of
