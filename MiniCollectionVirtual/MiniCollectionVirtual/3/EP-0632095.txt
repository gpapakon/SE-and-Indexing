<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a porous stretched product of β-crystalline
polypropylene-based resin and to the stretched product of
polypropylene-based resin produced by this process.Various processes for preparing porous
polypropylene-based materials are known. For example,
the following processes are known.
(1) a process comprising admixing an inorganic
substance and/or a non-compatible resin with
polypropylene, extruding the mixture into a film and
orienting or drawing the film to thereby obtain a porous
film (JP-A-50-116561 (1975), etc.); and(2) a process comprising admixing an inorganic
substance or an organic liquid with polypropylene,
extracting the mixture with a solvent or alkali,
extruding the mixture into a film and stretching the film
to thereby obtain a porous film (JP-A-58-59072 (1983),etc.).The process (1) has the drawbacks that the 
inorganic substance bleeds out, and that the resulting
film has a reduced elongation at break, and the process
(2) entails the drawback of requiring troublesome
procedures such as time-consuming extraction step.Also known is a process (3) for producing a
porous film, utilizing a crystal form (β-form crystal)
peculiar to polypropylene (JP-B-55-40411 (1980), etc.).
However,
this process has difficulty in forming a sufficient
amount of β-form crystals under practical conditions and
does not give a porous film having satisfactory porosity.Processes heretofore proposed for producing β-form
crystals of polypropylene include, for example, a
process in which a melt of polypropylene is crystallized
under a temperature gradient, or a process using a small
amount of a β-nucleating agent (γ-quinacridone) (POLYMER
LETTERS, 6, 539-546, (1968)). The former process has the
shortcomings of taking a long time and giving only a
small quantity of product. The latter process is
deficient in requiring a specially designed apparatus and
procedure for admixing the nucleating agent with
polypropylene, and has a further problem of being low in
usefulness in that it is necessary to conduct the
crystallization step at a high temperature in order to
form a certain increased amount of β-form crystals in the 
unoriented product, thereby requiring a long time for
molding. In addition, the process has additional problem
that the product is red colored. The present inventors
have proposed various novel nucleating agents for
increasing the content of β-form crystals to obviate the
foregoing problems (U.S. Application Ser. No.08/003,659).The object of the present
