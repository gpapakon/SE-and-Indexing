<ABSTRACT>
Supports having azlactone-functional surfaces, adduct supports prepared from such azlactone-functional supports, and methods of preparing both are disclosed. Azlactone functionality is introduced to surfaces of a pre-existing support in a manner which retains useful physical and chemical characteristics of the pre-existing support. One method involves exposing surfaces with high energy radiation to generate free radical reaction sites on the surfaces and causing azlactone-functional moieties to react with the free radical reaction sites. Another method involves coating surfaces with azlactone monomers, cross-linking monomers, and optionally co-monomers and polymerizing the monomers to form a polymerized coating of azlactone-functionality on the surfaces. Another method involves dispersion polymerization of azlactone-functional moieties to produce azlactone-functional particles within pores and interstices of a pre-existing support. Adduct supports are formed by coupling nucleophilic reagents, such as biologically active materials, to azlactone-functional moieties of the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application relates to supports having 
azlactone-functional surfaces, adduct supports prepared from such 
azlactone-functional supports, and methods of preparing both. Azlactone-functional polymeric supports have been 
prepared according to the methods disclosed in European Patent 
Publication 0 392 783 (Coleman et al.) and in European Patent 
Publication 0 392 735 (Heilmann et al.). In both of these 
publications, examples show methods of preparation which involve the 
homopolymerization or copolymerization of azlactone-functional 
polymers to become the polymeric support. Azlactone-functional moieties are expensive and 
valuable. Preparation techniques which cause azlactone-functional 
moieties to be occluded from accessible use needlessly wastes the 
valuable azlactone functionality. Also, there is a desire to place azlactone-functionality 
only at surfaces of a support where chemical or physical interaction 
with other materials, particularly biologically active materials can 
occur. Process IV described in European Patent Publication 0 392 
735 discloses a method for coating azlactone-containing polymer at 
surfaces of substrates. Also, European Patent Publication 0 392 735 
within the disclosure of Process IV and in Example 22 thereof 
identifies a desire to employ azlactone-containing monomers in the 
coating process to polymerize the monomer(s) in place. There are a myriad of supports which have specific 
geometries useful for physical interaction with materials, 
particularly biologically active materials. These supports have 
specific physical and chemical characteristics: porosity, surface 
area, permeability, solvent resistance, hydrophilicity, flexibility, 
mechanical integrity, and other stability or feature in the use 
environment, which must be retained for a pre-existing 
support to remain useful. For example, a microporous membrane will 
not remain useful as a filter if its porosity is harmfully 
compromised by the addition of an azlactone-functional moiety to its 
surfaces.  
 Monomeric 2-alkenyl-1,3-oxazolin-5-ones (which compounds 
and homologs thereof are referred to herein as 2-alkenyl azlactones) 
and copolymers thereof are known. Copolymers of 2-alkenyl 
azlactones and olefinically unsaturated monomers and coatings 
thereof are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,583,950 (Kollinsky et al.). 
Also, copolymers consisting essentially of a 2-alkenyl azlactone and 
an acrylic acid ester, and copolymerization thereof with vinylidene 
compounds having at least one hydroxyl group
