<ABSTRACT>
The ordered column packing for mass transfer between a falling film (trickling film) (14) and a gas has alternately arranged layers (10, 20). The one set of layers (10) guide the falling film against a vertical edge (13) of the layers, while the other layers (20) guide the falling film away from the edge. According to the invention, the layers are each coupled in pairs via return elements (3), with these return elements representing a liquid-carrying bridge: liquid (15) running along the edge of one layer (10) is thereby at least partially transferable to the associated adjacent layer (neighbouring layer) (20).

An orderly packing for a column for mass transfer between a trickling
film (14) and a gas, with alternately arranged layers (10, 20) where

some of the layers (10) steer the trickling film towards one vertical
edge (13) of the layers and the other layers (20) steer the trickling

film away from the edge, the layers being are coupled in pairs through
redirector elements (3) and these redirector elements forming a liquid-conducting

bridging-over by which edge-seeking liquid (15) on the one
layer (10) may be transferred at least partially to the associated

neighbouring layer (20), characterized in that

the redirector elements (3) are designed each in the form of a strip
which is formed at an angle by a vertical line and consists of a corrugated

foil like material so that that layer (10) of the packing which is
guiding the edge-seeking liquid (15) is in contact with the one arm (31)

of the redirector element and the other layer (20) touches the second
arm (
32) along the plane of the layer.
A column packing as in Claim 1, characterized in that

the corrugated foillike material exhibits a profiling for which the
wavelength is between about 1 and 10 mm and the depth of the waves

between about 0,5 and 5 mm, and that the inclination of the wavecrests of
the redirector ele-ments (3) is greater than 0° and less than 45°.
A column packing as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that

for the second arm (32) of the redirector element (3) a recess (22)
is provided in the associated layer (20) of the packing.
An orderly packing for a column for mass transfer between a trickling
film (14) and a gas, with alternately arranged layers (10, 20) where

some of the layers (10) steer the trickling film towards one vertical
edge (13) of the layers and the other layers (20) steer the trickling

film away from the edge, the layers being are coupled in pairs through
redirector elements (3) and these redirector elements forming a liquid-conducting

bridging-over by which edge-seeking liquid (15) on the one
layer (10) may be transferred at least partially to the associated

neighbouring layer (20), characterized in that

the redirector elements (3) are made in the form of connections (4) which
produce between the edges (13', 23') of respective pairs (1', 2') of

layers solid bridgings-over. 
A column packing as in Claim 4, characterized in that

at least parts of the packing are produced from corrugated foillike
material by folding about vertical groovelike recesses (40), so that at

the base of the groovelike recesses webs (4) are formed which act as
redirector elements.
An orderly packing for a column for mass transfer between a trickling
film (14) and a gas, with alternately arranged layers (10, 20) where

some of the layers (10) steer the trickling film towards one vertical
edge (13) of the layers and the other layers (20) steer the trickling

film away from the edge, the layers being are coupled in pairs through
redirector elements (3) and these redirector elements forming a liquid-conducting

bridging-over by which edge-seeking liquid (15) on the one
layer (10) may be transferred at least partially to the associated

neighbouring layer (20), characterized in that

at the edge (13) of the layer (10) which is carrying the edge-seeking
liquid (15) the redirector elements are made in the form of jagged

lobes (51) which conduct the edge-seeking liquid into the region of the
associated neighbouring layer (20), recesses (52) being provided at the

edge of the neighbouring layer for the jagged lobes.
An orderly packing for a column for mass transfer between a trickling
film (14) and a gas, with alternately arranged layers (10, 20) where

same of the layers (10) steer the trickling film towards one vertical
edge (13) of the layers and the other layers (20) steer the trickling

film away from the edge, the layers being are coupled in pairs through
redirector elements (3) and these redirector elements forming a liquid-conducting

bridging-over by which edge-seeking liquid (15) an the one
layer (10) may be transferred at least partially to the associated

neighbouring layer (20), characterized in that

the redirector elements are made as pieces (6) of wire which touch
at the edge (13, 136) the layer (10) with the edge-seeking liquid (15)

and conduct the edge-seeking liquid into the region of the associated
neighbouring layer (20), recesses being provided at the edge (23) of

the neighbouring layer for the pieces of wire. 
A column packing as in one of the Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that

the redirector elements (3) are produced essentially from the same
material as the layers of the packing, in particular of a metallic

alloy or plastics.
A mass transfer column having a packing
as in one of the Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that

at least some of the redirector elements (3) are provided for those edges
(13) of the layers which form the outer edge of the column.
A mass transfer column having a packing
as in one of the Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that

at least some of the redirector elements (3) are provided for intersections
(90) between adjacent segments of the packing inside the column.
A mass transfer column as in Claim 9 having a packing
as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that

spring elements (39) are provided between the wall (9) of the column
and the redirector elements (3) for the purpose of pressing the one

arm (31) against the edge (13) of the layer (10) with the edge-seeking
liquid (15).
