<ABSTRACT>
A non-contact wound covering for covering a wound (54). A peripheral sealing ring (52) is covered by a barrier layer (64) and this assembly is attached to the skin with an adhesive (56). The barrier layer and peripheral sealing ring together define a treatment volume (62) over the wound. The barrier layer may include active and passive heaters and the sealing ring may dispense water to control the humidity of the treatment volume. One form of active heat is the transfer of a heated fluid to the wound covering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wound covering for
wound treatment. The wound covering overlays the wound
area without touching the wound itself. The wound
covering preferably controls the temperature, humidity
and other aspects of the environment at the wound site.Traditional wound coverings such as bandages
are used to mechanically close wounds. Such bandages
typically cover and touch the wound. Bandage contact
with the wound and can interfere with the healing
process.The benefits of application of heat to a wound
are known and documented benefits include: increased
cutaneous and subcutaneous blood flow; increased partial
pressure of oxygen at the wound site; increased immune
system functions, including increased migration of white
blood cells to the site.However, in modern times, heat therapy for the
treatment of wounds and infection has been difficult to
achieve in practice. Additionally the availability of
antibiotics have taken precedence over other therapies
for the treatment of wounds and topical infections.The benefits of controlling other environmental
parameters around the wound site are not as well known.
Controlling the humidity at the wound site as well as
the benefits of isolating the wound have not been
extensively studied and documented. US 4,641,643 discloses a disposable release bandage
comprising a flexible body, a flexible layer, a cover, an
adhesive layer for affixing the flexible body to a patient's
skin, a means for affixing the flexible layer to the flexible
body, and a means for affixing the cover to the flexible
layer.EP-A-0 485 657 discloses a wound dressing having a foam layer
onto which adhesives are placed on both major sides of a foam
layer, then each layer of adhesive is covered with release
liners.DE-A-35 39 533 discloses a wound dressing or bandage that has
at least one component which is in direct contact with the
wound.EP-A-0 421 165 discloses a wound dressing containing a
hydrogel material within a cavity in a transparent layer, the
transparent layer optionally being printed with a grid layer.The wound covering
includes a peripheral sealing ring which, in use,
completely surrounds the area of the wound. The upper
surface of the peripheral sealing ring is spanned by a
continuous barrier layer which is preferably transparent
and substantially impermeable. An adhesive and a
suitable release liner is applied to the lower surface 
of the peripheral sealing ring to facilitate the
application of the wound covering to the patient's skin.
Once in position, the sealing ring and
