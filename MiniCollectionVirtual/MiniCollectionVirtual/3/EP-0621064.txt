<ABSTRACT>
In the process for separating and purifying substances by melt crystallisation under pressure, the melt is pressurised under an inert gas atmosphere then cooled, during which it crystallises. The residual melt is separated off from the resulting crystals, then the crystals are degassed by lowering the pressure, brought to sweating and the sweating oil is separated off.

<CLAIMS>
A process for separating and purifying substances by 
crystallization from the melt under pressure, wherein 


a) an inert gas is introduced into the melt, 
b) the melt is subjected to pressure under an inert 
gas atmosphere and is then cooled, whereupon it 

crystallizes at pressures of 50 to 5,000 bar, 
c) the residual melt is separated from the resulting 
crystals, 
d) the crystals are then degassed by lowering the 
pressure and are caused to sweat and 
e) the sweat oil (drip oil) is separated off. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the melt 
is subjected to pressure under a nitrogen, carbon 

dioxide, ethane, ethene or propane atmosphere or an 
atmosphere comprising a mixture thereof. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the inert 
gas is introduced into the melt via nozzles while 

simultaneously moving the melt.
