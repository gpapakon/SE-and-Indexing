<ABSTRACT>
A device for holding bags on bicycles, motorbicycles or the like has at least one fastening clip (20) arranged on the bag in a closable manner around a bar of a luggage carrier, the handle-bar or another strut of the bicycle, motor bicycle or the like. The fastening clip (20) can be detached from the bar of the luggage carrier, from the handle-bar or from another strut against the force of a spring (29). In addition, the fastening clip is clamped around the bar, handle-bar or strut by means of a retaining hook (21) at its side opposite to the bag. The fastening clip further has a snap-on hook (24) mounted on an axis, one or two axis stubs so as to rotate around them against the force of a spring (29) and to grip from the side of the bag the bar or the handle-bar from below, under the effect of the force of the spring. The snap-on hook (24) is linked at its side that faces the bag to a strap (10), a carrying handle or the like. By pulling on the strap, carrying handle or the like, a force is exercised on the spring and the snap-on hook (24) is moved around the axis or the one or two axis journals on the fastening clip (20) and releases the bar or the handle-bar.

A holding device (1) for bags on bicycles, 
motorcycles or the like, whereby at least one attachment 

clip (20) is locatable on the bag and lockable around a 
bar of a luggage carrier, the handlebar or any other 

strut of the bicycle, motorcycle or the like, the 
attachment clip being separable, by movement against the 

force of a spring (29), from the bar of the luggage 
carrier or the handlebar or other strut, characterised in 

that the attachment clip (20), on its side facing away 
from the bag, engages over the bar, alternatively the 

handlebar or the strut by means of a holding hook (21), 
in that the attachment clip (20) includes a snap-action 

hook (24) which is rotatably mounted on said clip for 
movement against the force of the spring (29) around an 

axle or around one or two stub axles and which, by the 
effect of the force of the spring, engages from below, as 

seen from the bag side, around the bar or the handlebar, 
in that the snap-action hook (24), on its side facing the 

bag, is connected to a webbing strap (10), a carrying 
handle or the like, and in that when a force is exerted 

on the spring (29) by means of a tension on the webbing 
strap (10) or the carrying handle or the like, the snap-action 

hook (24) is moved around the axle or one or more 
stub-axles on the attachment clip and releases the bar or 

the handlebar.  
 
A holding device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the spring (29) is an elbow- or plate-spring or 

flexible element or the like, which is supported on its 
or, as the case may be, their one side on the attachment 

clip (20) and on the other side on the snap-action hook 
(24). 
A holding device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the snap-action hook (24) includes 

on its lower side an inclined abutment which is arranged 
in such a way that, in a closed state, a force acting 

from below on to the inclined abutment, for example, when 
being put into place on a bar, a handlebar or other 

strut, rotates the snap-action hook (24) back against the 
force of the spring (29). 
A holding device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the attachment clip (20), on its side facing away 

from the bar, handlebar or strut, divides into two arms 

(21',21'') located at a clearance distance from each 
other, and that the snap-action hook (24) is rotatably 

mounted between the arms (21', 21''). 
A holding device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the webbing strap (10) or a flap or the like of 

the carrying handle is attached within a slit (25) in the 
snap-action hook (24) by means of a self-tapping plastics 

screw.  
 
A holding device according to Claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that the attachment clip (20) is 

extended on its side facing the bag by a holding part 
(22), in that the bag includes a holding rail (30) 

arranged parallel to the bar, handlebar or strut, and in 
that the holding part (22) is attached within a recess 

(31) of the holding rail (30). 
A holding device according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that the holding part (22) includes a drilled hole 

(23) and in that the attachment to the holding rail (30) 
is effected by means of a screw which projects through 

the drilled hole (23) into the recess (31) in the rail 
(30) and is screwed there to a nut (36). 
A holding device according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the rail (30) has a somewhat semi-circular hollow 

profile the open side of which faces the bag, in that the 
hollow profile comprises internal reinforcement ribs (35) 

and in that the nut (36) engages behind the reinforcement 
ribs (35) by means of its angled flange-sections (37). 
A holding device according to Claim 8, characterised 
in that the recess (31) in the holding rail (30) is an 

elongated hole. 
A holding device according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that the holding rail (30) includes a holding side-bar  

 
(32) on its upper edge, in that the attachment clip (20) 

comprises a holding claw (27) in the region of transition 
to the holding part (22), and in that the holding claw 

(27) engages over the holding side-bar (32) when the 
attachment clip (20) is attached to the holding rail 

(30). 
A holding device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the webbing strap (10), the carrying handle or 

the like, is connected to two attachment clips (20) 
located at a clearance distance from each other.
