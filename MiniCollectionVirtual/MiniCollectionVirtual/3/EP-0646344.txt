<ABSTRACT>
A sandwich toaster characterised in that air entry (23,29) 
and exit (25,28) apertures are provided in lower (10) and upper (11) die 

mould halves respectively in relation to mould members (14,15,26) 
within the die mould halves so that a flow of air over the 

mould members is produced serving to limit the temperature 
reached within the toaster to a predetermined level when 

electric energy is supplied to heater elements in the 
sandwich toaster in the absence of a food product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to toasters for 
sandwiches or like food products. Sandwich toasters 
conventionally consist of a pair of die mould-halves that 
when brought together define a cavity, each of the die 
mould-halves having in it an electrical heater element, 
the arrangement being such that a sandwich or other food 
product to be toasted or grilled can be placed in a lower 
die mould-half and an upper die mould-half brought down on 
top of it by hinging it downwardly in relation to the 
lower die mould-half, heat generated by the electric 
heater elements acting to toast or grill surfaces of the 
food product. It has been found essential to include a thermostatic 
control in sandwich toasters to limit the temperature 
reached in operation. In the absence of a thermostatic 
control there is a danger that the toaster will 
destructively overheat if left with the electrical supply 
switched on in the absence of a food product to be 
toasted. While thermostatic controls effectively prevent 
this, they have the disadvantage of making it most 
undesirable to immerse the toaster in water for cleaning 
purposes and as a consequence difficulties are experienced 
in keeping sandwich toasters clean. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
sandwich toaster, the construction of which is such that 
temperature is automatically limited when the toaster is 
switched on without a sandwich in it, without the 
necessity for including a thermostatic control. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a sandwich toaster in which the upper surface of a 
sandwich being toasted is visible through the top of the 
toaster. This object has, in the past, been achieved by 
the provision of a glass plate in the upper half of the 
toaster. Such a construction, while effective, is 
expensive. The construction provided by the present  
 
invention, however, is simple and relatively inexpensive. A still further object of the invention is to provide 
a sandwich toaster in which an electrical input is 
provided to one half of the toaster and is transmitted to 
the other half through separable hinges connecting the two 
halves, without the usual cable connection between the 
two. Such an arrangement enables the two halves of the 
toaster to be separated so that both may be readily 
cleaned, for example by placing them in a dishwasher. The present invention consists in a sandwich toaster 
consisting of a pair of hingedly connected upper and lower 
die mould-halves, having within them mould members that,

<CLAIMS>
A sandwich toaster consisting of a pair of hingedly 
connected upper (11) and lower (10) die mould-halves, 

having within them mould members (14,15,26) that, when 
brought together define a cavity, each of the die 

mould-halves having in it an electrical heater element 
(16,36) arranged to heat the mould member, the arrangement 

being such that a sandwich or other food product to be 
toasted or grilled can be placed in the mould member 

(14,15) of the lower die mould-half (10) and the mould 
member (26) of the upper die mould-half (11) brought down 

on top of it, heat generated by the electric heater 
elements (16,36) acting to toast or grill surfaces of the 

food product, characterised in that means defining air 
entry (23,29) and exit (25,28) apertures are provided in 

the lower and upper die mould-halves respectively in 
relation to each mould member (14,15,26) such that a flow 

or air over the mould member is produced serving to limit 
the temperature reached within the toaster to a 

predetermined level when electrical energy is supplied to 
the heater elements in the absence of a food product. 
A sandwich toaster as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
means defining air exit apertures in the upper die mould 

half consists of ribs separated by slots (28) a part at 
least of the upper surface of a food product within the 

toaster being visible through said slots (28). 
A sandwich toaster as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the electrical heater elements (16,36) in the die 

mould halves are interconnected electrically only through 
connections within hinges (12) joining the said die mould 

halves (10,11). 
A sandwich toaster as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the electrical heater elements (16,36) in the die 

mould halves (10,11) are interconnected electrically only 
through connections (19,33) within hinges (12) joining the 

 
said die mould halves (10,11), each said hinge (12) 

consisting of a part (12a) attached to one said die mould 
half and a part (12b) attached to the other said die mould 

half, the die mould halves (10,11) being separable by 
relative movement between said parts. 
A sandwich toaster as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
lower die mould half (10) consists of an outer casing (21) 

surrounding the mould member (14,15), air entry apertures 
(23) being formed in a lower face of the outer casing (21) 

and air exit apertures being formed by a peripheral gap 
around the mould member (14,15) between the mould member 

(14,15) and the outer casing (21). 
A sandwich toaster as claimed in claim 1 or claim 5 
wherein the upper mould member (11) consists of a plastic 

surround (34) within which the mould member (26) is 
located, the air exit apertures consisting of a series of 

slots (28) formed in the mould member (26) and the air 
entry apertures are constituted by a gap (29) between the 

mould members (14,15,26).
