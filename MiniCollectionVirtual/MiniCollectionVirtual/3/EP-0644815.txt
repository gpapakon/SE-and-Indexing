<ABSTRACT>
This specification discloses an adjustable spanner (10) comprising a handle (12) provided with a first jaw (16) at one end. A lever (22) is pivotally connected to the handle (12) and has coupled at one end a second jaw (24). The jaw (24) is coupled to the lever (22) by a link (36). The link (36) is pivotally connected at one end to the second jaw (24) and pivotally connected at another end to the lever (22). A cam (38) is carried in slot (46) formed in link (36). An elongate slot (40) is cut in a head portion (14) of the handle (18). As the lever (22) is pivoted with respect to the handle (12) the cam (38) rides in slot (40) and the jaws (16 and 24) move linearly with respect to each other. The cam (38) and slot (40) cooperate to form a locking means. The locking means has a free state corresponding to the cam (38) being disengaged from the slot (40) in which the jaws are able to move relative to each other and the locking state in which the cam (38) engages the slot (40) whereby the jaws are locked against movement away from each other. The locking means remains in the free state until the lever (22) is pivoted in a first direction relative to the handle (12) to a position where the jaws (16, 24) can grip a nut (30) or the like placed therebetween. Upon further movement in the first direction, the lever (22) then operates via the link (36) to rotate the cam (38) into engagement with the slot (40) thereby locking the jaws against movement away from each other. Upon releasing the handle, a return spring (58) rotates the cam (38) in an opposite direction lifting it away from slot (40) so as to return the locking means to the free state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adjustable spanner.Adjustable spanners are particularly useful
because they can accommodate various sizes of nuts, bolts
and like. The most common type of adjustable spanner
comprises a fixed jaw, and a moveable jaw which is
journaled to a worm gear adapted to be rotated by the thumb
of a user. Rotation of the worm gear causes the moveable
jaw to move relative to the fixed jaw to facilitate
gripping of nuts, bolts and the like of various sizes
between the jaws. One difficulty with this type of
adjustable spanner is that adjusting the spanner to engage
a nut of a particular size can be time-consuming,
particularly in a confined environment where the nut cannot
be seen or where there is insufficient room to allow the
user to adjust the spanner in situ. A further inherent
difficulty is that the worm gear is designed to leave some
play between the jaws. This play can sometimes result in
the spanner slipping under pressure.Several attempts have already been made to overcome these
problems such as in FR 2456592 and US 4995297. FR 2456592
discloses an adjustable spanner having two levers connected
by a pantograph. An upper lever is used to lock the
spanner and is connected externally to a primary arm by a
pinned fulcrum strap. A cranked branch traverses an arm
eyelet. Pivoting of the upper lever moves a slide onto a
rack which cantilevers normally from a lower lever.The upper lever is pulled towards the lower lever to effect
jaw convergence. A spring delays pivoting until a nut is
gripped. The movement of the cranked branch through the
eyelet causes the lever to displace axially as it pivots,
thus, pushing the slide onto the rack and locking the jaws
on the nut. US 4995297 discloses a locking ratchet which has a main body with an
elongate handle and stationary jaw at one end with a guideway extending
therethrough. A movable jaw having ratchet teeth is slidaby fitted in the
guideway. A pawl block is slidably retained within an aperture formed
through the stationary jaw and is provided with teeth to mate with those of
the movable jaw. A movable handle is pivotally mounted on the main
body and is movably connected to the pawl block to move it into and out
of toothed engagement with the movable jaw ratchet teeth. A jaw control
spring connected between the movable jaw and movable handle applies
upward pressure on the movable jaw to urge it toward the stationary jaw.
A handle return spring connected between the main body and the movable
handle normally urges the movable handle pivotally

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable spanner (10) having:

a handle (12) provided with a first jaw (16) at one end;
a lever (22) having a second jaw (24) coupled
thereto at one end, the lever (22) pivotally connected to the handle

(12) and, the second jaw (24) keyed to the handle (12) for
linear movement towards and away from the first jaw (16) upon pivotal

movement of the lever (22) relative to the handle (12), the
handle (12) including an elongate slot (40) extending

parallel to the direction of relative movement of the jaws
(16, 24), and the elongate slot (40) having bearing

surfaces (69, 71); and,
an element (38) carried by the lever (22) for
selectively engaging and disengaging the bearing surfaces

(69, 71) to releasably lock the second jaw (24) from
relative movement

upon relative pivotal movement of the lever (22) and the handle
(12) beyond the position in which an article (30) is gripped

between the jaws (16, 24);

   characterised in that the element (38) rides in
the slot (40) and is held within a slot (46) formed in a

link (36) so that it is substantially prevented from rotation relative
thereto, the link (36) having a first pivotal connection

(42) to the lever (22) and a second pivotal connection (44)
to the jaw (24), the location of the slot (46) coinciding with the

location of the second
pivot connection (44); and,
bias means (58) connected between the link (36)
and the lever (22) to urge the link (36) to pivot about the

first pivot connection (42) to move the element (38) into a
free state in which it is disengaged from the bearing

surfaces (69, 71), the element (38) remaining in the free
state until the handle (12) and the lever (22) are pivoted

relative to each other in a first direction to the position
in which the article (30) is gripped between the jaws (16,

24) where, upon further pivotal motion of the lever (22)
and handle (12) in the first direction, the link (36)

pivots about the first pivot connection (42) against the action
of the bias means (58) causing pivoting of the link (36) about the

second pivot connection (44) and placing the element (38)
into engagement with the bearing surfaces (69, 71) and

switching the element (38) to a locking state in which the
jaws (16, 24) are locked against movement away from each

other, thereby holding the article (30) between the jaws 
(16, 24), the element (38) being returned to the free state

by allowing pivotal motion of the handle (12) and lever
(22) in a second direction opposite the first direction, so

that the bias means (58) can pivot the link (36) about the
first pivot connection (42) to move the element (38) into

the free state.
An adjustable spanner (10) according to claim 1,
characterised in that the element (38) comprises a cam

means (62) provided with first and second surface portions
(66, 67) for engagement with the surface portions (69, 71)

respectively of the slot (40).
An adjustable spanner (10) according to claim 2,
characterised in that surface portion (66) of the cam means

(62) and surface portion (69) of the slot (40) are provided
with mutually engagable teeth.
An adjustable spanner (10) according to claim 3,
characterised in that the second surface portion (67) of

the cam means (62) is curved.
An adjustable spanner according to claim 3,
characterised in that the second surface portion (67) of

the cam means (62) is planar.
An adjustable spanner according to claim 1,
characterised in that the link (36) is provided with a stop

(54) and the lever (22) is provided with a shoulder (56)
for abutment with the stop (54) to limit pivotal movement

of the link (36) about the first pivot connection (42).
An adjustable spanner according to claim 1,
characterised by a second bias means (80) acting between

the lever (22) and the handle (12) acting to bias the lever
(22) to pivot in a direction opposite the first direction

and urge the element (38) into the free state.
