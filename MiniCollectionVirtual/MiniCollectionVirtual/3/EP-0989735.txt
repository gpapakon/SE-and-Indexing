<ABSTRACT>
Image scanning apparatus comprising a profiling
surface (10); a feed mechanism (14,15) for feeding a

flexible radiation sensitive record medium (12) across the
profiling surface; a scanning system (18) for scanning a

modulated radiation beam (19) across the record medium to
expose the record medium; and a pressuriser (22,23,28,29)

operable simultaneously with the feed mechanism to apply a
pressure difference across the record medium as it is fed

across the profiling surface whereby the record medium
engages the profiling surface and conforms with the shape

of the profiling surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image scanning
apparatus and in particular to such apparatus comprising a
profiling surface; a feed mechanism for feeding a flexible
radiation sensitive record medium across the profiling
surface; and a scanning system for scanning a modulated
radiation beam across the record medium to expose the
record medium.A conventional internal drum imagesetter is
illustrated in the schematic end view of Figure 5. A drum
50 has a semi-cylindrical internal profiling surface 51.
A film 52 is mounted on the surface by attaching one end of
the film to a loading carriage 53 which traverses round the
drum. After the film has been loaded, it is exposed by a
scanning radiation beam 54.The imagesetter of Figure 5 suffers from the problem
that the film 52 will not conform precisely with the
profile of the surface 51. Therefore the loading carriage
will load more than the required length of film into the
imagesetter.In accordance with a first aspect of the present
invention there is provided image scanning apparatus
comprising a profiling surface; a feed mechanism for
feeding a flexible radiation sensitive record medium across
the profiling surface; a scanning system for scanning a
modulated radiation beam across the record medium to expose
the record medium; and a pressuriser operable
simultaneously with the feed mechanism to generate a
pressure difference between opposed sides of the record
medium as it is fed across the profiling surface whereby
the record medium engages the profiling surface and
conforms with the shape of the profiling surface.In accordance with a second aspect of the present
invention there is provided a method of loading a flexible
radiation sensitive record medium into an image scanning
apparatus, the method comprising feeding a flexible
radiation sensitive record medium across a profiling 
surface; generating a pressure difference between opposed
sides of the record medium as it is fed across the
profiling surface whereby the record medium engages the
profiling surface and conforms with the shape of the
profiling surface; and scanning a modulated radiation beam
across the record medium to expose the record medium.By applying a pressure difference to the record medium
during the loading operation we ensure that the record
medium conforms to the profiling surface during loading,
and as a result the correct length of record medium is
loaded into the apparatus.The conventional imagesetter of Figure 5 also suffers
from the problem of dust particles - ie. dust particles
