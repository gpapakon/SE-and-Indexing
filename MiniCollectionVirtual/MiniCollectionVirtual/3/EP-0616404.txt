<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a connecting piece for pipelines (tubing) and shafts in telecommunications cable systems having a cable gland (entry fitting) (1) which is open at one end, in which the branch connectors (couplings) (3, 4, 5) are widened at the end opposite the opening of the cable gland in such a way that it is possible to connect thick-walled external pipes (conduits) (ER) whose inside diameter is continued at the same size in the branch connector. The outside diameter of the branch connectors is reduced with respect to the external pipes in such a way that the circumcircle of the branch connectors is smaller at the penetration cross-section of the plate (2) than the inside diameter of the cable gland (1).

<CLAIMS>
Connecting piece for pipe lines and shafts, preferably with 
telecommunications cable equipment, with a unilaterally open connecting 

sleeve (1,11) covered on the side opposite the opening with a plate (2) 
having at least two openings to which branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) with a 

smaller diameter than that of said connecting sleeve (1,11) are arranged, 
and said branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) being sufficiently expanded on the side 

opposite the opening of said connecting sleeve (1,11) to enable external 
pipes (ER) to be connected thereto, 
characterized in that
 said expansions 
are adequate to receive thick-walled external pipes (ER), whose internal 

diameter (d
i1
) extends with the same size within said branching sleeve (3, 4, 
5), that said external diameter of said branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) is reduced 

in the penetration section of said plate (2) opposite said external pipes (ER), 
that the periphery of said branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) is smaller in this area 

than the internal diameter of said connecting sleeve (1,11) and that the 
length (I) of branching sleeves (3a, 4a, 5a) on the opening side of said 

connecting sleeve (1,11) is larger than the length (h) of said connecting 
sleeve (1, 11). 
Connecting piece according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lengths 
(m3, m4, m5) of the expansions of said branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) for 

receiving said external pipes (ER) are different, with the ends of said 
expansions showing to said plate (2) ending at the same distance from said 

plate. 
Connecting piece according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 said 
branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) are marked over their overall length or within and 

without said plate (2) to permit an identification of the relative branching 
sleeve (3, 4, 5) on either side of said plate.  

 
Connecting piece according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
said branching sleeves (3, 4, 5) are equipped with a seal element (7). 
Connecting piece according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 
said connecting sleeve (1,11) is equipped with a seal element (6).
