<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum arc deposition apparatus includes arc 

power sources having cathodes connected to both ends of 
an evaporation source; exciting coils disposed at 

positions axially outwardly far from both the ends of 
the evaporation source so as to be coaxial with the 

evaporation source; and coil power sources independently 
connected to the exciting coils. In this apparatus, 

each of the coil power sources is capable of controlling 
the exciting current in such a manner that the film 

thickness and the consumption of the evaporation source 
are suitably distributed. Moreover, an arc containment 

device of the vacuum arc deposition apparatus includes 
an arc containment body having a diameter substantially 

the same as that of a cylindrical evaporation source, 
which is disposed at one end portion of the evaporation 

source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum arc
deposition apparatus for forming a film on a workpiece
using vacuum arc discharge.Of methods of forming films in vacuum, a vacuum arc
deposition method capable of effectively forming a film
has been widely used in industrial applications. The
vacuum arc deposition method includes the steps of
generating the so-called vacuum cathode arc discharge
between a cathode and an anode disposed in a vacuum
vessel, evaporating the material of the cathode from arc
spots generated on the surface of the solid cathode, and
depositing the vapor of the evaporated material on a
substrate disposed in the vacuum vessel thereby forming
a film. Apparatuses for carrying out the vacuum arc
deposition method have been known, for example in
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. HEI 5-106025 (EP-A-0 508 612).The above-described prior art method is
characterized by providing an axial magnetic field
formed on the surface of the evaporation source (this is 
formed by a spiral coil disposed around the rod-like
evaporation source) and a circumferential magnetic field
formed at least partially on the surface of the
evaporation source (this is excited by an arc current
flowing in the rod-like evaporation source), wherein the
velocity and the direction of arc spots are controlled
by the combination of these two magnetic fields.Of various examples disclosed in the above-described
document, there is shown the example of
supplying arc currents from both ends of the arc
evaporation source. This example is intended to perform
a substantially continuous discharge from the rod-like
evaporation source. According to this document, it
becomes possible to continuously realize uniform
discharge in the axial direction by reciprocating arc
spots along the axial direction of the evaporation
source using the balanced currents supplied from both
the ends of the evaporation source.In the above document, there is further disclosed a
technique of providing sensors for detecting arc spots
at both the ends of the evaporation source (target),
thereby exactly controlling the reciprocating movement
of arc spots on the basis of signals from the sensors,
resulting in the uniform consumption of the target. The prior art technique of providing the sensors,
however, has arisen a problem in that the control of arc
spots by signals from the sensors is complicated and
requires an expensive controller with a complex
structure.Notwithstanding such a complex controller, it has
been difficult to prevent the localization of
