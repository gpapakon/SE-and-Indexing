<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for separating, conveying and grouping flat articles, especially biscuits, which are guided one against the other by way of a supply shaft to a separating station. The apparatus comprises conveying means, a grouping station and a cross-conveyor. The cross-conveyor is provided for transferring groups of articles to a packaging machine transversely relative to the first conveying direction. The conveying means (10) comprise a first number of rotating separating means (14, 24, 34, 44, ...), in order to separate the articles (19, 20) in the separating station (7) and convey them further as far as the grouping station (9), where the articles are stacked one on top of the other. The conveying means (10) comprise a second number of rotating separating means (44, 17), in order, in each case, to bring a stacked group of articles from the grouping station (9) into the region of the cross-conveyor (16) which subsequently brings them to the packaging machine. The distance between the points of action of two adjacent separating means (24, 34) of the first number is smaller than the distance between two adjacent separating means (17, 44) of the second number.

Apparatus for separating, conveying and grouping 
flat articles, in particular biscuits, which are guided, 

in a state in which they rest against one another, via a 
supply shaft to a separating station, the apparatus 

comprising conveying means and a grouping station and a 
transverse conveyor in order to transfer groups of 

articles, transversely with respect to the first conveying 
direction, to a packaging machine, characterized 

in that the conveying means (10) comprise a first number 
(N) of circulating separating means (14, 24, 34, 44, 

etc.) in order to separate the articles (19, 20) in the 
separating station (7) and to convey them further to the 

grouping station (9), where the articles are stacked one 
on top of the other, in that the conveying means (10) 

comprise a second number (n) for circulating separating 
means (44, 17) in order to move a stacked group of 

articles in each case from the grouping station (9) into 
the region of the transverse conveyor (16), which then 

moves them to the packaging machine, and in that the 
distance between the points of action of two adjacent 

separating means (24, 34) of the first number is smaller 
than the distance between two adjacent separating means 

(17, 44) of the second number. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the group
ing station (9) has a bearing surface (5) 
for the articles which is located at a lower level than 

the bearing surface (4) of the separating station (7), in 
order to stack the articles by utilizing the gravitational 

force. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,  
 

characterized in that the bearing surface (5) for the 
articles between the grouping station (9) and the transverse 

conveyor (16) is one plane. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the grouping station (9) has 

retaining means (15, 15') in order to retain the articles 
in a rest position during group formation. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that switch-off means are provided in 

the region of the grouping station (9) in order to 
prevent the operation of in each case at least a central 

separating means (54; 64) of three adjacent separating 
means (44; 54; 64; 17) in a region between the transverse 

conveyor (16) and the grouping station (9). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that said switch-off means are configured such that they 

act on some of the separating means. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that switch-on means are provided in order to 

bring the separating means (14) into the operating 
position before they reach the separating station (7). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a push-action conveyor (18) is 

provided in order to receive groups of articles and to 
push them into the transverse conveyor (16). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the push-action conveyor (18) is configured in order 

to push the groups into the transverse conveyor (16) at 
an angle other than 90Â°. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that at least one holding-down device 

(6) is provided at a distance from the bearing surfaces 
(4, 5) of the grouping station (9) and of the separating 

station (7), such that the articles (25, 26) can be 
pushed between said holding-down device (6) and said 

bearing surfaces (4, 5).
