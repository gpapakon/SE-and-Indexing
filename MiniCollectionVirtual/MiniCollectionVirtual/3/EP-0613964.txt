<ABSTRACT>
In a process for facilitating the non-cutting cold forming of iron materials by application of a phosphate coating, the iron materials are dipped (immersed) into a phosphating solution which is free of elements of the sixth subgroup of the Periodic Table of the Elements, free of nitrogen compounds, is preferably also free of nickel, contains     from 5 to 20 g/l of zinc   from 1 to 15 g/l of magnesium   from 10 to 26 g/l of phosphate (calculated as P2O5)   from 1 to 15 g/l of fluoroborate (calculated as BF4)   from 1 to 7 g/l of chlorate (calculated as ClO3), preferably also   from 5 to 40 g/l of sulphate (calculated as SO4) and in which the weight ratio of Zn : Mg : BF4 is set to a value in the range of 1 : (0.15 to 1) : (0.15 to 1).

<CLAIMS>
A method for facilitating the non-cutting cold-working 
of ferrous materials by applying a phosphate 

coating in a dipping process by means of an aqueous 
acidic phosphating solution which contains Zinc, Mg and 

phosphate ions and oxidising agents and is practically 
free of Fe (II) ions, characterised in that the ferrous 

materials are dipped into a phosphating solution which 
is free of elements of the Sixth subgroup of the 

periodic table of the elements and is free of nitrogen 
compounds and contains
