<ABSTRACT>
An encoder applies a digital filterbank such as a transform or subband filterbank to an input 
signal to generate frequency subband information, encodes the resultant subband information using 

adaptive bit allocation to generate fixed-length values represented by fixed numbers of bits and 
variable-length values represented by variable numbers of bits, and formats the subband information 

into an encoded signal in which the fixed-length values are assembled into preestablished positions 
within the encoded signal. In response to an encoded signal including subband information 

represented by fixed-length values and variable-length values, a decoder extracts fixed-length values 
represented by fixed numbers of bits from preestablished positions within the encoded signal, extracts 

variable-length values represented by variable numbers of bits, wherein the variable numbers of bits 
are established in response to fixed-length values, and generates an output signal by applying an 

inverse filterbank to the extracted subband information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to the high-quality low bit-rate digital signal processing of audio signals.
such as music signals. More particularly, the invention relates to the formatting and deformatting of encoded
signals representing audio signals.Transform coding of high-quality signals in the prior art have used long signal sample block lengths to
achieve low bit-rate coding without creating objectionable audible distortion. For example, a transform coder
disclosed in EP 0 251 028 uses a block length of 1024 samples. Long block lengths have been necessary
because shorter blocks degrade transform coder selectivity. Filter selectivity is critical because transform
coders with sufficient filter bank selectivity can exploit psychoacoustic masking properties of human hearing
to reduce bit-rate requirements without degrading the subjective quality of the coded signal.Coders using long block lengths suffer from two problems: (1) audible distortion of signals with large
transients caused by the temporal spreading of the transient's effects throughout the transform block, and
(2) excessive propagation delay of the signal through the encoding and decoding process. In prior art
coders, these processing delays are too great for applications such as broadcast audio where a speaker
must monitor his own voice. A delay in voice feedback causes serious speech disruption unless the delay is
kept very short.The background art is discussed in more detail in the following Background Summary.There is considerable interest among those in the field of signal processing to discover methods which
minimize the amount of information required to represent adequately a given signal. By reducing required
information, signals may be transmitted over communication channels with lower bandwidth, or stored in
less space. With respect to digital techniques, minimal informational requirements are synonymous with
minimal binary bit requirements.Two factors limit the reduction of bit requirements:
(1) A signal of bandwidth W may be accurately represented by a series of samples taken at a frequency
no less than 2 • W. This is the Nyquist sampling rate. Therefore, a signal T seconds in length with a
bandwidth W requires at least 2 • W • T number of samples for accurate representation.(2) Quantization of signal samples which may assume any of a continuous range of values introduces
inaccuracies in the representation of the signal which are proportional to the quantizing step size or
resolution. These inaccuracies are called
