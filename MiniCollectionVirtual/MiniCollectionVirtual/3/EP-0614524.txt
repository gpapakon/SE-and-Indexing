Wind tunnel having a free jet test section (4) 
and a nozzle arrangement (1) which is rotatable about a 

vertical axis for the purpose of altering the direction 
of flow, characterized in that the change of direction of 

flow is achievable by rotation of a nozzle front part 
(1b), the exit cross-section of which is entirely free 

and exhibits no components disturbing the flow, and in 
that the nozzle front part (1b) is separated from the 

upstream nozzle rear part (1a) in the region of the 
turning point of the nozzle contour at the transition 

from the - viewed from the nozzle centre line - convex 
curvature of the nozzle wall to the concave curvature in 

the front region of the nozzle, and the nozzle front part 
is surrounded at this separation location by an inlet 

rounding (19). 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the rotatable 

nozzle front part (1a) is mounted on a circular section 
(25) of the floor plate, the centre of which section lies 

on the vertical extending axis of rotation (17). 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to Claim 2, characterized in that the nozzle 

front part (1b) is surrounded, concentrically with the 
axis of rotation (17), by a cylinder, the envelope 

surface (23) of which seals off the nozzle front part, in 
the manner of a plug, in the course of the rotary 

movement, in relation to a chamber which surrounds the 
nozzle. 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to Claim 3, characterized in that the nozzle is  

 
surrounded by a chamber (22), in which a compensating 

flow is established upon rotation of the nozzle. 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to Claim 4, characterized in that the chamber 

(22) which surrounds the nozzle has a rectangular cross-section 
in the region of the entry into the nozzle rear 

part (1a), and adapts in the region of the nozzle front 
part to the nozzle contour by a lateral indentation. 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 

the angular velocity of the rotary movement is within a 
range between 30 degrees of angle per second and 120 

degress of angle per second and the rotational angle 
range comprises +/- 30°, preferably approximately +/- 

20°. 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 

according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the nozzle cross-section exhibits at the top chamfered 

corners (26) and corresponds to the upper half of an 
octagonal cross-section, the horizontal axis of which 

falls within the floor plate. 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 

the height of the cylinder (23) according to Claim 3 
corresponds at least to the height of the nozzle and the 

cylinder terminates at its top in a horizontal sealing 
surface (24). 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that 

the cross-section of the chamber surrounding the nozzle 
is in a ratio of 12 to 5 to the nozzle entry cross-section 

and the nozzle itself exhibits a ratio of entry 
cross-section to exit cross-section in the ratio 2 to 6. 
Wind tunnel having a free jet test section 
according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 

the rotatable nozzle front part exhibits a ratio of entry 
cross-section to exit cross-section in the ratio 1.5 to 

3.
