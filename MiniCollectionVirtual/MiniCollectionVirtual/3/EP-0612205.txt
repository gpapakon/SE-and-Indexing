<ABSTRACT>
The aim of this invention is to provide an input-output 
unit which while being compact is capable of adequate heat 

dissipation and of which the wiring and assembly work can be 
carried out smoothly even when a large number of signal wires 

are to be handled in a confined space. 
An input-output unit which performs signal receiving and 
delivery mediation between an industrial control equipment 

and the field devices controlled by it is provided with: a 
card accommodating chamber, provided with a row of slots 

which accommodate input-output cards which perform signal 
conversion between the signal forms used by the industrial 

control equipment and the signal forms used by the field 
devices; a terminal block part, provided with two or three 

terminals per each of these slots, to which signal wires 
connected to the field devices are connected; and a case 

part, on the front of which the card accommodating chamber 
and the terminal block part are mounted with the terminals 

and the slots in correspondence.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an input-output unit which 
is used in industrial control equipment and performs 
signal receiving from and delivery to field devices, 
and particularly relates to an improvement in 
construction which realizes high density mounting and 
which is easy to assemble and with which 
instrumentation work is easy. An input-output unit is housed in a unit housing box 
body such as that disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. H5-29777 and performs signal 
receiving and delivery for an industrial control 
system. The functions of this kind of input-output unit 
receive/deliver signals to/from the detector terminals 
of flowmeters, pressure gauges and the like and the 
manipulating terminals of electric valves and the like 
and connect them with a higher central control device, 
and in particular there are those for analog signals 
which use 4mA-20mA, etc., analog instrumentation 
signals, signals from thermocouples and the like, and 
those for digital signals which handle on/off signals, 
pulse string signals and the like. A specific  
 
configuration is for example disclosed in Japanese 
Laid-Open Utility Model Publication No. H4-88093. In the past it has been low integration density of 
the ICs which comprise the electric circuits that have 
performed the signal conversion consequently the number 
of signals that can be handled by one unit has been 
small and the input-output cards that are accommodated 
in the slots of the input-output unit have been 
relatively large. As a result, the number of signal 
wires connected to one unit has also been small, and it 
has been easy to secure space for positioning terminal 
blocks. However, as the integration density of ICs 
becomes higher, the number of signals handled by one 
unit also increases, to 16 points, 32 points, 64 
points, etc.. When this happens, when the number of 
input-output signals is simply increased, because a 
large number of signal wires have to be handled in a 
confined space, the wiring work is time-consuming and 
there has been the danger of signal wires being 
connected to the wrong terminals by mistake. Secondly, to maintain certain cards it is necessary 
to remove them from the input-output unit, and the 
interruption of control in the control loop that 
accompanies this maintenance is not beneficial to the 
system being controlled. For this reason, in the case 
of an input-output unit for control use, it is 
desirable that the control loops of each of the signals 
be handled by an independent card,
