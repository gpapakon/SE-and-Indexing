<ABSTRACT>
When resin pipes are connected through induction heating, 
the resin pipes of this invention do not form inside bulges due 

to air and resin expansion during the heating process. 
Cylindrical heater 2 made of stainless steel is placed around the 

joint between two resin pipes 1a, 1b made of polyvinylidene 
fluoride. Heater 2 is then heated by induction heating to weld 

the joint of resin pipes 1a, 1b. Heater 2 has a plurality of 
holes 2a on the cylindrical surface so that air and molten resin 

located between heater 2 and resin pipes 1a, 1b are released 
through holes 2a.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for connecting resin pipes. More specifically, this invention
relates to a method of connecting resin pipes, i.e. fluorocarbon
resin pipes which are used to transfer pure water and ultrapure
water for cooling superconductive coils and LSI manufacturing
apparatuses, polyvinylchloride pipes which are used in
agriculture and service water, and polyethylene pipes for gas.
This invention also relates to an apparatus for connecting resin
pipes.Resin pipes are commonly connected by using conventional
methods such as those shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. In the method
shown in FIG. 12, there are two resin pipes 1a, 1b forming
resin pipe line 1. Resin pipe 1b is softened at end portion 1e
by using a torch lamp or an electric resistance heater. End
portion 1e of resin pipe 1b expands so that the inside diameter
becomes slightly larger than the shape of resin pipe 1a. Then
adhesive 20 is put on the inner surface of end portion 1e. The
outside surface of resin pipe 1a is fit to the inside surface of
resin pipe 1b. By hardening adhesive 20, the two resin pipes 1a,
1b are connected. In another method shown in FIG. 13, two 
flanges 21a, 21b are disposed on the peripheral ends of resin
pipes 1a, 1b to be connected to form resin pipe line 1. The
pipes are joined using bolts and nuts (not shown in the drawing).
In another method, referring to FIG. 12, fluorocarbon resin pipes
were connected by melting the outside surface of resin pipe 1a
and the inside surface of resin pipe 1b, and then fitting them
together.However, the above-mentioned conventional methods have
the problem of creating dead space in pipes. For example, dead
space is created when the resin pipes are used to transfer pure
water or ultrapure water for cooling superconductive coils and
LSI manufacturing apparatuses. The method used in FIG. 12 to
join the resin pipes creates dead space 1d where the two resin
pipes 1a, 1b are joined. Impurities, such as water scale,
accumulate in dead space 1d which is infested with bacteria. As
a result, pure water or ultrapure water will also contain
bacteria while flowing in resin pipe line 1. Similarly, in the method
shown in FIG. 13, it is not possible to join two resin pipes 1a,
1b completely. A small gap exists at the joint. The flanges
distort a gland packing when clamped, so that the dead space
created between the gland packing and the inside surface of the
resin pipe has impurities such as water scale and bacteria.In another conventional method of connecting pipes
