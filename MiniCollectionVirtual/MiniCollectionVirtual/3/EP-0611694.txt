<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bag having a sealable filling valve and 
to a device for the sealing of bags having a thermosealable valve 

to be put on belt carriers. It is a new kind of bag (S) provided 
with a filling valve (V) that may be closed and sealed by means of 

glue (C) that easily softens through transfer of heat put on the 
inside walls of the valve (V).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the automatic
sealing of bags transported on a conveyor and having a filling
valve to the interior surface of which a glue is applied that is
solid at room temperature and becomes fluid by heating, said
device comprising a heated pressure device acting against the
opposite walls of the valve after filling.Nowadays several kinds of bags for the packing of loose
materials, such as flour, cereals, fertilizer, antiparasitics,
chemical compounds and any other granular or powder material,
harmful too, are well-known.Such bags are made up with one or more paper film or other
material sheets that are joined, fold up and sticked on the
edges in order to get the shape of a closed bag. During the
sticking, a strip of paper folded as a ring is placed on one of
the edges; such paper ring, generally called valve, has got the
edges surmonting, and is flat either when the bag is empty or
when the bag is quite full, but in order to allow the
introduction of the nozzle carrying the material to be packed.
Such bags are widely used as they can be filled up by automatic
systems, but the trouble is that the valve is not sealed up.There may be lots of disadvantages: during the transport of the
bags, part of the product can be lost; it is possible that
pollution as insects, powder etc. goes inside the bag and there
is a possibility of easy theft or replacement of the material. A device as set forth in the preamble of claim 1 is known by EP-A
1 015. The known heating device is in the form of clamp means
having a static anvil and a pressing anvil which are both
provided with electrical restistance heating elements. This
means that the sealing process is rather delicate as the
solidifaction of the seal takes place at room temperature which
increases during the operation time of the device. Accordingly,
after some hours of operation, the room temperature is so high
that the sealing quality is reduced.DE-A 1 256 577 describes a device for filling and sealing bags.
Said device comprises two movable sealing clamps which are
provided with a heated pressure element lying between upper and
lower suction openings operated during the filling phase. In the
closing phase, through said openings cooling air is directed
against the filling valve.In US-A 4 109 792 a method of packaging is illustrated using a
sealing head that is provided both with a hot gas inlet valve
and a cold gas inlet valve for sealing and cooling purposes.It is an object of the invention to provide a sealing device
that

<CLAIMS>
Device for the automatic sealing of bags (2) transported on a
conveyor (1) and having a filling valve (V) to the interior

surface (I) of which a glue (C) is applied that is solid at room
temperature and becomes fluid by heating, said device comprising

a heated pressure device acting against the opposite walls of
the valve (V) after filling, characterised in that said heated

pressure device is combined with a pressure cooling device for
accelerating the sealing operation, wherein the pressure device

and the cooling device travel together with the bag (2) to be
sealed and are in the form of two plates, the plate (5a) of the

pressure device being heated and the plate (5b) of the cooling
device having a system of cold air flow, both plates (5a, 5b)

operating independently from each other.
Device according to claim 1, wherein both plates (5a, 5b) are
mounted on a slide (4) moving together with the conveyor (1) at

one side of the same and following the bag (2) to be saled.
Device according to claim 2, wherein both plates (5a, 5b) are
mounted on said slide (4) rotably on an axis extending

lengthwise to the conveyor (1).
Device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein at both sides of
the conveyor (1) a guide (3) is provided, each of which carrying

a slide (4).
