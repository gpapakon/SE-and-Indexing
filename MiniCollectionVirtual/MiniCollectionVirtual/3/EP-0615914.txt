<ABSTRACT>
A capsule of which cap portion 1 may be torn 
together with a pulling tab 6 for tearing. The capsule 

comprises a cap portion 1 and a skirt portion 2. Two 
weakening lines 4 and 5 for tearing the cap portion are 

provided between the cap portion 1 and the skirt portion 
2. The weakening line 4 on the cap portion 1 side is 

inclined to a top 10 of the cap portion 1 with a certain 
inclination as it goes near the tear-terminating end 8. 

When pulling the pulling tab 6 outwardly, the cap portion 
1 is torn along the weakening lines 4 and 5. Then, as 

getting near the tear-terminating end 8, the cap portion 
1 is torn upward the top 10, thereby opening the cap 

portion 1. Thus, the cap portion 1 is removed from a cap 
of a bottle together with the pulling tab 6 in one unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capsule of the 
kind used to mount the upper parts of the neck of a bottle 
the mouth of which has been closed by a cork, screw-cap, 
bung or other form of closure, and exposed parts of the 
closure to provide a tamper-evidence cover for the closure, 
and an ornamental addition. More particularly, according to the invention, there 
is provided a bottle having a neck the mouth of which is 
closed by a bung, cork, screw-cap or other form of closure, 
the upper portions of the neck of the bottle and the exposed 
portion of the applied closure being covered by a capsule 
formed from a material of lead, alloy of tin and lead, 
tin, aluminium or any of these materials laminated with a 
synthetic resin film, the sides of a capsule being deformed 
inwardly into close contact with the surface of the neck of 
the bottle and any exposed laterally-facing surface of the 
closure, whereby the capsule is retained on the closure and 
provides a tamper-evidence cover for the closure. Document DE-A-2 804 851 describes a capsule 
according to the preamble of claim 1 comprising a 
tearable strip defined by two parallel tear lines which are 
formed by consecutive perforations. The tearable strip comprises 
a pulling tab which is reinforced in order to prevent 
a deformation during the sealing action of the bottle. In general, as illustrated in Fig. 5, a capsule comprises a 
cap portion 1, skirt portion 2, and a tearable guarantee 
strip 3 connecting the cap portion 1  
 
and the skirt portion 2. And weakening lines 4 and 5 are 
provided, respectively, at a boundary between the 
tearable guarantee strip 3 and the cap portion 1, and at 
a boundary between the tearable guarantee strip 3 and the 
skirt portion 2. The weakening lines 4 and 5 are 
generally formed all over the circumference of the 
capsule by compressing a capsule body with a cutting 
knife in the direction of thickness like a perforation. 
A pulling tab 6 is also formed on one end of the tearable 
guarantee strip 3 for starting the removal by tearing. 
Accordingly, when pulling the tab 6 formed on the 
tearable guarantee strip 3 outwardly in the circumferential 
direction of the bottle, the tearable guarantee 
strip 3 is gradually torn and removed along the weakening 
lines 4 and 5 from the tear starting ends 7, 17 toward 
the tear terminating ends 8, 18 due to less strength of 
these lines formed compressively like a perforation. 
After removing completely the tearable guarantee strip 3 
and the cap portion 1, the bottle is

<CLAIMS>
A capsule comprising a cap portion (1) and a skirt 
portion (2), wherein the cap portion is separated from the 

skirt portion by a tearable strip defined by an upper 
weakening line (4) and a lower weakening line (5) and comprising 

a pulling tab (6), said cap portion forming one 
body with the tearable strip and the skirt portion being 

intended to remain on the bottle neck,
charakterized
 in that,
 
said lower weakening line (5) is substantially horizontal 

and said upper weakening line (4) is provided with an in 
clined part from an inclination-starting point (9a) to an 

inclination-terminating point (9b), said inclined part satisfying 
an expression of

shortest distance from the tear-terminating end (8) of the 

upper weakening line (4) to the top (10) of the cap portion 
(1); "X" indicates a distance in circumferential direction 

from the inclination-starting point (9a) of the upper weakening 
line (4) to the inclination-terminating point (9b)

lower weakening line (5).  

 
A capsule as set forth in claim 1, wherein said inclination-terminating 
point (9b) is coincident with said 

tear-terminating end (8). 
A capsule as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein a part of  
 

said upper weakening line (4) extending from said tear-starting 
end (7) to said inclination-starting point (9a) is 

in parallel to said lower weakening line (5). 
A capsule as set forth in claim 1 or 3, wherein a part of 
the upper weakening line (4) extending from said inclination-terminating 

point (9b) to said tear-terminating end 
(8) is in parallel to said lower weakening line (5).
