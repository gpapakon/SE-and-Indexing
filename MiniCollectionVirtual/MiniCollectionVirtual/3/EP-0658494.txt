<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile temperature-regulated 
tank container (1) comprising a tank (2) of oblong shape, an 

insulating housing (42) in which the tank is accommodated and a 
cooling device (76) by which the space between the tank and the 

housing can be cooled. The tank is mounted in the housing in 
such a manner that in use the longitudinal direction of the 

tank is at least substantially vertically oriented, a 
horizontal cross section of the tank comprises substantially a 

closed loop elongated in a first direction and a horizontal 
cross section of the housing has an at least substantially 

rectangular shape of which the long sides are at least 
substantially parallel to the first direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mobile temperature-regulated 
tank container comprising a tank of oblong shape, an 
insulating housing in which the tank is accommodated and a 
cooling device by which the space between the tank and the 
housing can be cooled. Such tank containers are known inter alia from German 
Gebrauchsmuster no. 34397 and are used for the transport of 
liquids over land and over sea. In this connection, one may 
for instance think of the transport of deep-cooled 
concentrated fruit juice. A disadvantage of such a tank 
container is that in connection with its dimensions it is not 
suitable to be placed in a wide range of container ships. 
Moreover, a relatively small part of the volume of the 
rectangular container is used for storing the liquids referred 
to, so that the container is experienced as unattractive from 
an economic point of view. In addition, for the transport and storage of liquid foods 
often plastic bags are used which, in filled condition, are 
placed in steel drums. The steel drums are transported in 
reefer ships or cooling containers. In this connection it is 
disadvantageous, however, that many operations are necesary 
for loading, unloading and processing the liquids. Moreover, 
the package can only be used a single time, so that much waste 
is produced, which adversely affects the environment. Further, 
recycling the drums requires much energy and a considerable 
loss of product arises in that residues of liquid are left 
behind in the plastic bags. It is also known to transport large amounts of liquid 
foods in tank ships. This method of transport, however, is 
little flexible because it is economically unacceptable to 
transport smaller amounts since in that case the tank is not 
completely filled. Furthermore, it is not possible to 
transport many different kinds of liquids since the number of 
separate tanks on a ship is often small. A further economic  
 
disadvantage is that obtaining a return load is only possible 
to a very limited extent. The object of the invention is to obviate these 
disadvantages. According to the invention a mobile 
temperature-regulated tank container comprising a tank of 
oblong shape and an insulating housing in which the tank is 
accommodated, wherein the container further comprises a 
cooling device by which the space between the tank and the 
housing can be cooled, wherein the tank is mounted in the
