<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns delaminating 
coatings for use in thermal transfer systems. 
Specifically, the invention concerns delaminating 
coatings that provide both delaminating properties and 
antistatic properties to intermediate carrying sheets 
in thermal transfer systems. The delaminating property 
allows a recepted image layer to be transferred from 
the intermediate carrying sheet to other supports of 
interest, such as films, glass, or paper. The 
preferred delaminating coating is formed from a 
composition of a vanadium oxide colloidal dispersion. Thermal transfer systems for thermal imaging 
utilize a recording method in which a donor sheet, 
having a colorant (i.e., dye or pigment) layer thereon, 
and a receptor sheet are brought into contact and 
heated with a localized heat source, such as a laser or 
a thermal print head. The heat source directly 
contacts the backside of the donor sheet. A thermal 
print head contains small electrically heated elements 
that can be selectively heated, thereby transferring 
colorant from the donor sheet to the receptor sheet and 
forming a desired image. This imaging process can 
involve either mass transfer of colorant in a binder or 
state-altered transformation of a dye, as by melting or 
sublimation of the colorant. In a mass transfer 
process, the colorant, e.g., dye or pigment, is 
dispersed within a binder and both the dye and its  
 
binder are transferred from a donor sheet to a receptor 
sheet. In a dye transfer process, the colorant 
(present on the donor with or without a binder) is 
transferred without binder by melting, melt-vaporization, 
propulsive ablation, sublimation, or 
vaporization to a receptor sheet where the colorant 
adheres to or dif fuses into an image-receiving layer. Such thermal transfer systems generally require 
the use of receptor sheets with certain specific 
requirements. For example, the thickness, flatness, 
flexibility, and shape of a receptor sheet are limited, 
such that the receptor sheet can be used in typical 
thermal printing devices. Such restrictions limit the 
applicability of thermal imaging. Thus, there is a 
need for a thermal imaging process that can transfer an 
image to an arbitrarily shaped object, such as paper, 
film, metal, glass, cardboard, etc. In thermal dye transfer systems, this has been 
accomplished with the use of an intermediate sheet that 
can act as both a receptor and a donor. In such a 
system, a donor sheet, having a colorant layer thereon, 
and an intermediate carrying sheet are
