<ABSTRACT>
An electronic ballast is provided for supplying a load, for example a lamp, in particular a gas-discharge lamp, with an AC voltage (Un) whose frequency is higher than the mains frequency. The ballast has a rectifier (Gl) which is to be connected to the AC mains supply, an invertor which is connected downstream thereof, has two switches (S2, S1), and which generates the higher-frequency AC voltage for the load (Z), and an electronic harmonics filter in the form of a clocked switched-mode regulator, which is arranged between the rectifier (Gl) and the invertor. The regulating switch (S1) of the clocked switched-mode regulator at the same time forms one of the two switches (S1) of the invertor.

Electronic ballast for a load, for example a lamp, in

particular a gas discharge lamp, with an alternating
voltage (Un), the frequency of which is higher than

the mains frequency, with

a rectifier (G1) to be connected to the
alternating current system,
an inverter with two switches (S2, S1) connected
in series to this, which inverter produces the

higher-frequency alternating voltage for the load

an electronic harmonic filter in the form of a
clocked switching controller disposed between the

rectifier (G1) and the inverter, the switching
controller being formed by an inverting converter

and having a first impedor (L1) arranged in
series with the step switch (S1) of the clocked

switching controller and a series circuit
disposed parallel to the first impedor (L1) and

consisting of a first diode (D1) and a second
impedor (C1, C2; C1'), characterized in that the

step switch (S1) of the clocked switching
controller forms one of the two switches (S1) of

the inverter at the same time.
Electronic ballast according to claim 1, characterized
in that the other of the two switches (S2) of the

inverter is connected parallel to the second impedor

Electronic ballast according to claim 2, characterized
in that the second impedor is formed by two partial

impedors (C1, C2) connected in series, that the load
is connected on the one hand to the junction point of

the two partial impedors (C1, C2) and on the other
hand via a second diode (D2) to the terminal of the

step switch (S1) connected to the first impedor and is
also connected via a third diode (D3) to the terminal 

of the step switch (S1) facing away from the first
impedor (L1), and that the other of the two switches

(S2) of the inverter is bridged by a fourth diode
(D4), the polarities of the first and third diode

being selected such that the second impedor is
decoupled from the rectifier (G1) direct-current-wise,

and the polarities of the second and fourth diode

the series circuit of two partial impedors formed by
capacitors.
Electronic ballast according to claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that connected in parallel to each of

the two capacitors (C1, C1') respectively is a
resistor (R1, R2), the resistors distributing the

voltage across the second impedor equally to the two
capacitors forming the partial impedors and

discharging these when the device is switched off.
Electronic ballast according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a central control

circuit (1) is provided, which outputs control signals
for the step switch (S1) and the other switch (S2) of
