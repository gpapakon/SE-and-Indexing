<ABSTRACT>
Centrifugal separator for particle-laden fluids, of the type including a centrifuging chamber (1) equipped with means for entrainment (2), the flow to be purified entering this chamber (1) through an upstream opening (3) and being subjected to the action of a moving equipment (5) generating radially a separating centrifugal field on this flow, which escapes partially purified through a downstream opening (4). According to the invention the downstream opening (4) of the said centrifuging chamber (1) opens into a vessel (8) divided by an annular partition (6) coaxial with the moving equipment in order to define two treatment chambers. Application to machining machines.

Centrifugal separator for fluids charged with particles, of the type comprising a
centrifugation chamber (1) provided with driving means (2) to create an axial gaseous flow

subjected to centrifugation in the said chamber, the flow to be cleaned passing into this
chamber (1) by way of an inlet aperture (3) referred to as an upstream aperture and being

subjected to the action of a moving element (5) radially generating a centrifugal separating
field on this flow which escapes, partially cleaned, by way of an outlet aperture (4) referred to

as a downstream aperture,

the separator being characterised in that the downstream aperture (4) of the said centrifugation
chamber (1) opens into a housing (8) divided by an annular partition (6) coaxial to the moving

element (5) and surrounding it in such a way as to define two process chambers, one (1), for
centrifugation, surrounding the moving element (5) for the recovery of heavy particles, the

other (9), for filtration, coaxially surrounding the first chamber (1) for the final treatment of
the cleaned gaseous fluid.
Separator according to claim 1,

characterised in that the housing (8) is defined by external peripheral filter walls (10).
Separator according to one of claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that the said housing (8) is stationary.
Separator according to claim 1,

characterised in that the centrifugation chamber (1) is defined by the wall (6) for collecting
particles, which turns about a longitudinal axis (D) forming the axis of rotation of the moving

element (5), the said chamber (1) having generatrices inclined with respect to the plane normal
to the axis of rotation (D), and tending to converge from the upstream end (3) of the said

chamber towards the downstream end (4) of the said chamber.
Separator according to claim 4,

characterised in that the said centrifugation chamber (1) is in the form of a truncated cone. 
Separator according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the external peripheral walls (10) of the housing (8) for recovery of
cleaned gas define, with the annular partition (6), a space (9) of a volume decreasing from the

downstream end (4) to the upstream end (3) of the centrifugation chamber (1).
Separator according to claim 1,

characterised in that the means for driving the fluid to be cleaned from the upstream end (3) to
the downstream end (4) of the said chamber (1) are integrated in the moving element (5).
Separator according to claim 7,

characterised in that the driving means are formed by blades fixedly mounted on superimposed
rotating plates which are connected to each other by cross pieces or a common rotational axis,

the said plates forming the moving element (5).
Separator according to claim 8,

characterised in that the blades are mounted radially on the said plates and are inclined with
respect to the upper surface of the said plates by a specific angle and comprise, at their base

which connects to the said plate, through-going orifices ensuring that the corner of the
connection between the blade and the plate is cleaned.
Separator according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that rings (6a) and/or wings (6b) are disposed in an inclined manner on the
internal wall of the annular partition (6) in the proximity of each element forming the moving

element (5).
Separator according to one of claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that the means for driving the fluid to be cleaned are formed by a suction
turbine (2) disposed above the moving element (5), the lower part of the turbine (2) being

partially covered by the partition (6) to orientate a part of the flow of this turbine in particular
to the internal face of this partition (6).
