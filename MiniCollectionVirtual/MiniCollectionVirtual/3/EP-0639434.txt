<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for the manufacture of medium density wood fibre boards, in which wood fibres provided with a binder are moulded into fibre mats and are pressed at an elevated temperature into boards. The method is distinguished in that, for producing the fibres, the wood or the wood chips are pulped by the CTMP process and the fibres produced are passed on to the further process without being washed out.

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing medium-density wood fibreboards, wherein wood
fibres are treated with binder and formed into fibre mats and compressed

into boards at elevated temperature, 
characterised in that
 in order to
produce the fibres the wood or chips are digested by the CTMP (chemo-thermo-mechanical

pulping) method and the resulting fibres, without being
washed out, are supplied for further treatment, whereby an urea melamine

(MUF) resin or a tannin formaldehyde (TF) resin or a phenol formaldehyde
(PF) resin or an adhesive based on polymeric diisocyanates (PMDI) is used.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the digested wood is
from coniferous trees.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the digested wood is
from deciduous trees
.
A method according to claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the wood is
digested with Na
2
SO
3
 alone.
A method according to claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the wood is
digested with Na
2
SO
3
 and NaOH.
A method according to claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the wood is
digested with NaOH alone.
