<ABSTRACT>
A skin care composition which includes a silicone 
gum, a volatile methylsilicone fluid and a volatile alkylmethylsiloxane. 

When applied to human skin, the composition 
adsorbs approximately twenty percent faster, has a less 

greasy feel during application and provides a coating on the 
skin which is smoother, than comparative products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a composition for 
conditioning the skin which includes a silicone gum, a 
volatile methylsilicone fluid and a volatile alkylmethylsiloxane. Aging of the human skin results from a loss of 
elasticity. Less elasticity means that the epidermis has a 
reduced ability to absorb water. In order to maintain the 
natural functioning of the skin, it is necessary to ensure 
that transepidermal water loss does not exceed certain levels 
resulting in dry skin. Normally adjusted skin surfaces are characterized 
by smoothness and suppleness. These characteristics are 
highly dependent upon the water content of the stratum 
corneum. If moisture falls below a level of about fifteen 
percent, skin flexibility suffers, resulting in dry, raw and 
chapped skin surfaces. Fats can restore smoothness but not 
elasticity and flexibility. Drying out of the skin surface 
is a disturbance of the physiological balance between the 
production and use of water and fats in the epidermis and 
stratum corneum. In cases where the skin has become dry, it is 
common to recover the natural balance with the help of 
external skin care preparations. These skin conditioning 
preparations typically are applied topically to the skin in 
the form of a film, in an effort to cause skin softening and 
relieve dryness. The film retards water loss and allows the 
skin to rehydrate. Thus, dry skin is prevented by protection 
and moisture retention.  
 In addition to providing the benefits noted above, 
the compositions of the present invention offer the 
additional advantages in that (i) when they are applied to 
the human skin, they adsorb about twenty percent faster than 
comparative products; (ii) they possess a less greasy feel 
than comparative products during their application to the 
skin; and (iii) they provide a coating on the skin which is 
smoother than comparative products. Sensory testing revealed that comparative products 
were more sticky, required more rubbing in their application 
to the skin and lacked the smoothness following rub in, than 
was possessed by the compositions of the present invention. 
EP-A-0 495 596 discloses the utilization of a formulation comprising 
dimethyl polysiloxane and alkylmethyl polysiloxane in the treatment 
of human skin to decrease transepidermal water loss.  
 The present invention contains three silicone 
components as ingredients. Two of these are volatile fluids, 
while the third is a high molecular weight silicone gum. One of the volatile fluids is a low viscosity 
met
