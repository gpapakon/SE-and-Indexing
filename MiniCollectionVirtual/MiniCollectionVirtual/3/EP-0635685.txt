<CLAIMS>
Small breathing air cooling appliance for use in automobiles and air-conditioning
applications in small stores and practices, having an air

intake side (2), an air outlet side (3), a fan (5) and a refrigerating
machine (4) between the intake and the outlet sides, 
wherein
 an
unheated ozone-cracking catalyst (6) containing palladium as the ozone-cracking

substance is arranged upstream of the refrigerating machine
(4).
The cooling appliance as defined in Claim 1, 
wherein
 a dust filter (7) is
arranged on the intake side and the cracking catalyst (6) is connected

between the dust filter (7) and the refrigerating machine (4).
The cooling appliance as defined in one of the preceding Claims,

wherein
 the substance used for cracking the ozone is fixed to a flat air-permeable
carrier (10) and a plurality of carriers (10) are held one

beside the other in a frame (9).
The cooling appliance as defined in one of the preceding Claims,

wherein
 the carriers (6) have a thickness of 10 mm to 30 mm, preferably
15 mm.
