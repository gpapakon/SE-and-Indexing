<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel bis-iminoazacyclo pentane polyols according to formula (1), wherein R
<

 = H, alkyl or R
<
4
>
, whereby R
<
4

 is OH, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl and R
<

 and R
<

 are independently of one another, OH, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl which are obtainable by reaction of succinonitrile with a hydroxyalkylamine, to polyols obtained on the basis of such compounds, in which a polyether, a polyester or a venyl-polymer or combinations thereof are also incorporated, and to polymers in which said polyols are incorporated. Polyurethane foam in which 1-(hydroxyethyl)-2,5-bis-(2-hydroxyethylimino)-azacyclopentane is incorporated shows a higher mechanical strength and reduced inflammability, whilst the formulation has an increased reactivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to imino-azacyclopentanepolyols.
Polyols of this type are novel. Polyols based on
azacyclic compounds are known and are used, inter alia, as
crosslinking agents or chain extenders in polymers to be
produced by means of a polycondensation reaction, such as
polyurethane, RIM nylon and thermosetting resins. In this
context, the nitrogen-containing polyols offer the advantage
of flame retardancy.The imino-azacyclopentanepolyol according to the
invention has the general formula

wherein
R1 = H, alkyl or R4, whereby R4 is OH, hydroxyalkyl,
hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl andR2 and R3 are independently of one another, OH, hydroxyalkyl,
hydroxyaryl or hydroxyaralkyl.Mixtures of imino-azacyclopentanepolyols according
to the above formula also fall under the invention. For use
as a crosslinking agent, R1 is preferably R4.In another preferred embodiment of the invention,
R1 is H, C1-C6 alkyl or phenyl.Preferably, R2, R3 and/or R4 are chosen such that
they have a hydrocarbon chain with a number of carbon atoms 
in the chain of between 1 and 12 and more preferably
between 2 and 6. Long chains can increase the
inflammability.Preferred hydroxyalkyl groups are hydroxyalkyl
groups derived from linear alkanes, because steric
hindrance can easily occur in the case of branched
hydrocarbons and the formation of a triol consequently
becomes difficult. Specifically, the a atom, and in
particular the α and β atoms, with respect to the nitrogen
atom are unsubstituted.Examples of suitable hydroxyalkyl chains are 2-hydroxyethyl,
2-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, 2-hydroxy-n-butyl,
3-hydroxy-n-butyl, 4-hydroxy-n-butyl, 3-hydroxy-n-pentyl,
5-hydroxy-n-pentyl, 6-hydroxy-n-hexyl, 6-hydroxy-2-ethyl-hexyl
and ω-hydroxy-dodecyl. 2-Hydroxyethyl,
3-hydroxy-propyl or 4-hydroxy-n-butyl is preferably
used. Examples of hydroxyaryl and hydroxyaralkyl chains
are p-hydroxy-phenyl, p-hydroxy-benzyl, p-hydroxyethylbenzyl,
p-hydroxy-methylbenzyl, 5-hydroxy-3-phenylpentyl
and 3-hydroxy-3-phenyl-hexyl.Polyol derivatives (i.e. hydroxy functional
oligomers or polymers) obtained with the polyols according
to Formula (1) as a starting product
comprise a polyether, a
polyester or a vinyl polymer or combinations thereof.Polyol derivatives of this type can be obtained
using methods known per se. For example, the polyetherpolyols
can be obtained by catalytic polycondensation of
an alkylene oxide or a mixture of alkylene oxides in the
presence of the polyol according to Formula (1).Polyester-polyols can be prepared, for example,
by
