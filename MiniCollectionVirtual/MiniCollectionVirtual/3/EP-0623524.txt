<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for erecting and mounting a carrier strip made of cardboard on a plurality of bottles (15) arranged in one or two rows one behind the other, the carrier strip being provided with an upper wall (2) and a lower wall (3), which walls both have cutouts (9, 10) in which the bottles (15) engage at least with their top-side closure parts, the carrier strip being folded and erected in a first step from a flat cardboard blank (1) and being closed along a longitudinal gluing seam, whereupon the carrier strip thus formed is placed on the bottles (15) aligned in one or two rows, the bottle tops being framed in the cutouts (9) located in the lower wall (3) of the carrier strip and the upper wall (2) being placed on the bottle tops, and whereupon folding fingers (25) engage on the upper wall (2), which fold said upper wall (2) inwards, thereby pressing the bottle closures through the cutouts (10) in the upper wall (2).

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for erecting a carry bar made from board and for attaching it to a 
number of bottles arranged behind each other in one or two rows, where the 

carry bar is provided with a top panel (2) and a bottom panel (3), both of 
which have openings (9, 10) in them that at least the closure sections at the 

top of the bottles (15) engage, 
wherein
 a transport unit and folding bars (17) 
are provided for the board blank (1), with the help of which the board blank is 

erected into a carry bar (16) while it is being transported, 
wherein
 a unit for 
the production of a longitudinal glued seam is provided in which the carry bar 

is closed, 
wherein
 a unit is provided for transporting the bottles to which the 
carry bar is to be attached that is located underneath the transport unit for the 

board blanks and the erected carry bars and is synchronised with the same and 

wherein
 a unit equipped with folding fingers (25) is located after the transport 
unit for the carry bars (16) and is synchronised with the transport unit for the 

bottles (15), the fingers of which point towards the top panel (2) of the carry 
bar (16) that has been attached to the bottles (15). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the folding fingers (25) have height 
adjustment facilities and are supported from a chainlike transport unit. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the unit equipped with the 
folding fingers (25) has height adjustment facilities.  

 
Apparatus according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 a number of 
folding fingers (25) are located behind each other on a common finger section. 
Apparatus according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 two rows of 
folding fingers (25) are located behind each other on a common finger section. 
Apparatus according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 the folding 
fingers (25) are designed to have acute-angled ends.
