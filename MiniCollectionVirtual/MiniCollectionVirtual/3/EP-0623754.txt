least two actuator ports (14, 16), with a main hydraulic source (20), a reservoir (22), a 

pressure-actuated main control valve (18) which has two working ports (26, 28) which 
can be connected to the actuator ports (14, 16) and serves to control the fluid flow 

between the actuator (12), the main hydraulic source (20) and the reservoir (22), and 
with first and second control valves (40, 42) for setting the main control valve (18), 

wherein one of the control valves (40, 42) is operable for moving the main control 
valve (18) out of a neutral position, in which the actuator (12) is held stationary, into a 

first position in which the actuator (12) is caused to move in first direction, and 
wherein the other control valve (40, 42) is operable for moving the main control valve 

(12) out of the neutral position into a second position in which the actuator (12) is 
caused to move in a second direction, characterized by a float valve (80) separate from 

the main control valve (18) and which responds to actuation of the two control valves 
(40, 42), is in communication with the two working ports (26, 28) and connects the 

two working ports (26, 28) to the reservoir (22) on simultaneous actuation of the two 
control valves (40, 42). 
A hydraulic control system according to claim 1, characterized by a float valve 
(80) with 


a housing (82) which has a reservoir port (84) connected to the reservoir, a first 
port (86) connected to one of the working ports (26), a second port (88) 

connected to the other working port (28) and a control port (90) and 
a float valve member (92) which blocks the first and second ports (86, 88) in a 
first position and connects the first and second ports (86, 88) to the reservoir 

port (84) in a second position and which is biased by spring means (98) into its 
first position, wherein the float valve member (92) can be moved against the 

spring force into its second position by pressure applied to the control port (90), 
and by logic valve means (100) which place the control port (90) under 

pressure when both the first and the second control valves (40, 420 are actuated 
simultaneously. 
A hydraulic control system according to claim 2, characterized by logic valve 
means (100) with 


an inlet (104) which is in communication with one of the outlets of the first and 
second control valves (40, 42), a control port (108) which is in communication 

with an outlet of the other of the two control valves (40, 42), an outlet port 
(106) which is in communication with the control port (90) of the float valve 

(80) and with 
spring means (112) which are biased to urge the logic valve means (100) into a 
first position in which the inlet (104) and the outlet port (106) are blocked, 

wherein the logic valve means (100) can be moved by pressure present on its 
control port (108) against the spring bias into a second position in which the 

inlet (104) is connected to the outlet port (106). 
A hydraulic control system according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized by 
two lock-out valves (44, 46) which are each connected between a respective one of the 

working ports (26, 28) and a corresponding actuator port (14, 16) and which are so 
designed that they reduce fluid leakages from the actuator ports (14, 16). 
A hydraulic control system according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized by 
a lock-out valve (44, 46) with a seated valve member (56) which can move in 

dependence on the fluid pressure reigning in a lock-out chamber (50) in order to 

control a connection between a working port (26, 28) and the corresponding actuator 
port (14, 16), further with a first lock-out port (52) which is in communication with a 

corresponding working port (26, 28) of the main control valve (18), further with a 
second lock-out port (54) which is in communication with a corresponding actuator 

port (14, 16) and further with an outflow opening (58) which connects the second lock-out 
port (54) to the lock-out chamber (50), 


an outlet line (64) which connects the lock-out chamber (50) to the main control 
valve (18), 
an outlet control valve (60, 62) which controls the fluid flow through the outlet 
line (54),  

 
spring means (70) through which the outlet control valve (60, 62) is biased into 
a closed position, in which fluid flow out of the lock-out chamber (50) through 

the outlet line (64) is prevented, 
means (68, 72) responsive to fluid pressure and connected to one of the two 
control valves (40, 42) in order to open the outlet control valve (60, 62) against 

the spring force when the control valve (40, 42) is actuated. 
A hydraulic control system according to claim 5, characterized in that each 
lock-out valve (44, 46) includes 


a pressure-responsive seated valve (48) with a lock-out chamber (50) with a 
first lock-out port (52) which is connected to a corresponding working port (26, 

28), a second lock-out port (54) which is connected to a corresponding actuator 
port (14, 16), an outflow opening (58) which connects the second lock-out port 

(54) to the lock-out chamber (50) and a seated valve member (56) which is 
biased into its closed position, in order normally to prevent fluid flow from the 

second lock-out port (54) to the lock-out chamber (50), 
an outlet line (64) which connects the lock-out chamber (50) to the first lock-our 
port (52),

check valve (66),

the two control valves (40, 42), wherein the outlet piston (68) moves away 

from the outlet check valve (66) when pressure builds up in the relief chamber 
(72), so that this valve can open and the fluid pressure in the lock-out chamber 

(50) drops, whereby the seated valve member (56) can also open and allows 
fluid flow from the second lock-out port (54) to the first lock-out port (52).
