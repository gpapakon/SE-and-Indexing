<ABSTRACT>
A high intensity non-laser light source (1), has a Xenon, short arc lamp (2) provided with a front window (2a) coated to remove U.V. light from the emergent light beam from window (2a). Fan (6) cools the light source (1) and lamp (2) is powered via power supply unit (5). Solenoid activated shutter (7) is activated by a control switch on control panel (4) to adminster timed doses of light for medical purposes (for example for PDT). Dichroic "hot mirror" (8) removes infrared radiation resulting in a smooth visible broadband beam in the range 350 to 700 nm bandwidth at 50 mW/nm. Said beam is filtered by an 80 % efficient bandpass filter 9 of 20 to 25 nm and focussed by aspheric lens 10 to 6 mm diameter at output window (11) for delivery into a fibre bundle (15). Variable attenuator grill (12) is provided to vary the intensity of the output beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light source which is an
incoherent or non-laser light source for use primarily but
not exclusively in medical applications.Lasers have widespread uses in the treatment of the
human or animal body, which uses may be of a therapeutic
and/or cosmetic nature. For example, laser light can be
used to kill cancer cells or for treatment of portwine
stains and removal of tattoos. However, medical lasers
tend to have many disadvantages. Firstly, some medical
lasers for certain requirements can cost up to a one
hundred and forty thousand pounds or more and may require
very bulky power supplies and/or bulky transformers in
addition to involving complex or inconvenient cooling
arrangements. Additionally, the power consumption by the
laser may be very high and the laser itself may not be
user friendly, for example, some lasers may require a one
and a half hour warm-up time before they can be used in
certain applications and may have a similar shut-off
period. Often, the laser itself may be a far more
sophisticated piece of equipment than is actually required
for a particular task and therefore may be over suited to
the task in hand. Some medical applications do not in
fact require the criticality offered by a laser although
other acceptable light sources do not seem to have been
developed to be used instead of a laser in such
applications.Non-laser light sources have been developed for
medical applications but such proposals have tended to be
inefficient and generally unsuitable for the task in hand.
For example, a paper from the Journal of Photochemistry
and Photobiology B: Biology 6 (1990) 143-148 on
Photodynamic Therapy with Endogenous Protoporphyrin
reports the use of a 500 watt filament light source for
irradiation of cancerous cells. The light source was 
varied from 150 to 300 watts per square centimetre but spread over a very
wasteful large bandwidth greater than 100 nm. The filtering tended to be
inefficient and unsuitable giving rise to tissue damage from thermal effects.Another proposal is discussed in the "Phototherapy of Human Cancers"
in an article entitled Porphyrin Localisation and Treatment of Tumors, pages
693-708, 1984 Alan R. Liss, Inc. This article discusses the use of a filtered
incandescent lamp having a 1000 watt filament source which is water cooled.
The size of the apparatus itself is large and tends to be inefficient also entailing
considerable risk of skin damage because of high flux density.Reference is made to FR-A-2511877 which discloses a tungsten bulb
