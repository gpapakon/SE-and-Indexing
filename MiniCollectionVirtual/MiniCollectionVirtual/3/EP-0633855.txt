<ABSTRACT>
Method and arrangement for loading cargo pieces or objects onto a pallet or the like, wherein the pieces or objects are non-symmetrical or otherwise have an odd shape, for forming with said pallet a cargo unit having a predetermined shape. The invention is based on the idea to take advantage of gravity on loading the pallets and this is achieved by preparing a specific platform arrangement on a higher level than the pallet bottom level and placing the pallet inside a group of uprights secured to a base means and serving as retainers for a stack of goods placed on the pallet, and arranging adjacent the said higher level receiving means for loaded containers for the goods to be reloaded onto other pallets, upon filling the space above the pallet inside the uprights with goods, wrap a web of stretch film material around the pallet and the goods thereon outside the uprights and after wrapping such stretch film material around the goods stacked on the pallet, lift the pallet and stack of goods as one unit, leaving the uprights behind to slip by the sides of the stack and the inside of the wraped film and subsequently transport the pallet and cargo unit for loading into the ship hold.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method for producing cargo units and arrangement for sameTechnical Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a method and arrangement for packing and producing cargo or shipping units of a number of smaller units, e.g. and preferably pieces of beef or other meat pieces.Background of the InventionMeat such as so called quarter beef, i.e. fourth parts of a beef carcass, are today manually handled and carried from a land transporter, a truck or the like to shipping pallets where the beef pieces are stacked and subsequently wrapped or strapped.The manual labor is extremely hard as each piece of meat weighs at least 100 kgs and often up towards 130 kgs. The meat pieces are frozen and they tend to get an exterior covering of ice or frost, which naturally makes the handling more diffi¬ cult. Even if three or four men carry each piece, they are not able to stack such heavy pieces very heigh on a pallet, and the cargo thus placed on each pallet is normally rather low even if supporting uprights or frame elements are placed around the pallet.Background of the InventionIn sea transport it is an ambition to use the available hold space to the fullest extent and not only to fill the deck areas completely but also to fill the vertical space between the decks. On using manually stacked pallets as described above, 

the full vertical space can be utilized only if there are arranged rack or shelf systems between the decks so as to allow loading of two or more stacked meat pieces pallets the one above the other on each floor. Such systems involve a lot of extra work in installing and dismantling and hold up the loading and unloading as the rack sections adjacent the hatches normally have to be erected and dismantled respectively before the racks remote from the hatches can be loaded or unloaded.One important object of this invention is to bring about a method and an arrangement permitting a practical utilization of the total available hold space without the need of rack systems or the like.Another important object is to bring about a handling equipment minimizing the manual lifting and heaving and allowing stacking on pallets up to normal hold height thus enabling filling the hold to capacity with one layer pallets on each deck.Still another object is to bring about a new system for securing the stacked load on the pallets.Summary of the inventionThe basic idea behind the invention is to take advantage of gravity on loading the pallets and this is achieved by preparing a specific platform arrangement on a higher

Claims
1. Method for loading pallets and the like cargo carriers with cargo consisting of cargo pieces having odd shapes in
5 order to form cargo units so shaped that the require a minimum area, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by the measures of placing a pallet to be loaded (1) at a jig means (2) between two rows of uprights (3) having a height essentially corresponding to the
10 expected height of the cargo unit, placing a scaffolding construction (6) including an inclined slip plane board (7) and at least one worker's platform (8), so that the slip plane board slopes towards the space above the pallet and inside the uprights, positioning a preloaded cargo pieces containing means
15 (10) approximately in level with the upper end of the slip plane board (7), allowing the workers to seize the cargo pieces, let them slip along the slip plane board while adjusting the position and direction of movement thereof in order to make the pieces land on the pallet in a most favorable
20 position for stacking further pieces above the same, after preparing such a stack or loading wrap the pallet and stacked pieces of cargo with a stretch film material (S) also enclosing the uprights (3) and
*
by lifting vertically removing the wrapped pallet and cargo unit from the left behind jig means.

2. Arrangement for loading cargo pieces or objects onto a pallet or the like, wherein the pieces or objects are non- symmetrical or otherwise have an odd shape, for forming with said pallet a cargo unit having a preder ined shape,
* 30 c h a r a c t e r i z e d by a pallet (1) carrying jig means (2) having a number of uprights (3) projecting upwardly at least on two sides of the position of the pallet, a scaffold like construction (6) positionable adjacent the pallet carrying jig means and having an inclined slip plane (7) with a width
35 adapted to the length of the pallet, at least one platform (8) 


for a worker and positions or seats (10) for one or more cargo pieces or objects carrying container or the like adjacent the end of the slip plane facing away from the pallet site, the jig (2) and the scaffold like construction (6) being movable relatively to each other for facilitating the use of a stretch film material wrapping robot (1) , arranged to make turns around the loaded pallet while still inside the uprights (3) for covering the cargo on same and simultaneoously forming of said pallet and cargo pieces an one-body cargo unit hoistable from its position between the uprights.
3. Arrangement according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the jig means (2) includes web portions (4) connecting pairs of uprights (3) and that the web portions form abutments for a pallet (1) inserted between the uprights.
4. Arrangement according to claim 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that a plate (5) is secured to the lowermost portion of the jig (2) and arranged to extend outside the uprights (3) to serve as a retaining means for the jig when hoisting a cargo unit from between the uprights (3) by means of a forklifter.
5. Arrangement according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that there are adjacent the at least one worker platform of the scaffolding construction at least one container receiving seat (10) for pre-loaded containers or the like.
6. Arrangement according to claim 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the at leats one container receiving seat (10) includes means for hoisting and lowering same in accordance with the amount of cargo thereinside and its position relatively to the slide plane upper end. 


7. Arrangement according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the scaffolding construc¬ tion (6) is wheeled or otherwise easily movable, whereas the jib means (2) is essentially stationary.
8. Arrangement according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the scaffolding construc¬ tion (6) is esentially stationary, whereas the jig means (2) is movable.
9. Arrangement according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the stretch film material (S) wrapping robot (11) is selfpropelled and arranged to make wrapping turns around the pallet (1) received inside the uprights (3) and loaded with cargo pieces in order to form a monolithic cargo unit.
