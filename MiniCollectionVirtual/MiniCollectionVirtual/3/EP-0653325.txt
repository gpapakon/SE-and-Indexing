<ABSTRACT>
A pedal assembly comprising for driving a vehicle, comprising: a 
brake pedal (10) borne vertically swingably by a brake arm (11); 

a laterally biased accelerator lever (20) arranged just above 
the right-hand side of the brake pedal while being urged toward 

the brake pedal and having a lateral reciprocating stroke; and a 
guide roller (16) arranged at the right-hand portion of the 

brake pedal while having its circumferential edge protruded 
above the pedal. Further comprised is a spring (12) disposed on 

the floor of the vehicle below the brake pedal for urging the 
lower end portion of the brake pedal to this side. The accelerator 

lever is arranged, when in a non-load state, at an inclination 
with respect to the axis of the brake pedal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pedal assembly to be used in 
a variety of vehicles including an automobile, a construction 
machine, an agricultural machine, an electric car and a solar 
car and, more particularly, to an improvement of a pedal assembly 
having its accelerator pedal depressed laterally. In the pedal assembly of the prior art for driving the 
automobile or the like, generally speaking, the brake pedal and 
the accelerator pedal (or the clutch pedal) are arranged in 
parallel. In addition, the brake pedal is given a longer 
depression stroke than that of the accelerator pedal so that its 
depression has to make a large motion of the driver's leg around 
the hip joint, that is, the footwork has to follow the shape of 
letter "U" while moving the heel of the operating foot spatially. 
This is liable to cause troubles in case a quick operation 
is required. Specifically, since the operating foot fails 
to have its heel position fixed during the running operation in 
accordance with the characteristics of the drivers, it is liable 
to cause an accident at an emergency by depressing the pedal erroneously 
or with a delay. Especially in connection with the 
automatic cars, it has been reported that many accidents are 
caused because driver has to operate the pedal with one leg and 
finds difficulty to take the operating rhythm intrinsically. In order to prevent such troubles in the parallel type pedal assembly, 
the present inventor has proposed a pedal assembly (as 
disclosed in EP-A-0 522 556 A1), in which the accelerator pedal 
is laterally depressed and adjacently arranged just above the 
right-hand side of the brake pedal and is urged toward the underlying 
brake pedal and in which a guide roller is arranged at 
the right-hand end of the brake pedal while having its circumferential 
edge portion projected above the brake pedal. The pedal assembly disclosed above is enabled to establish 
natural and quick associations between the accelerator pedal and  
 
the brake pedal and to guide the driver's foot naturally from 
the accelerator lever to the brake pedal even at an emergency 
when the foot gets stiff. The present invention contemplates to improve the above-specified 
pedal assembly better and has an object to provide a 
pedal assembly capable of further improving its operability and 
safety. In order to achieve the above-specified object, according to the 
present invention, there is provided a pedal assembly comprising 
for driving a vehicle, comprising: a brake pedal borne

<CLAIMS>
A pedal assembly comprising for driving a vehicle, 
comprising: 

   a brake pedal (10) borne vertically swingably by a brake 
arm (11); 

   a laterally biased accelerator lever (20) arranged just 
above the right-hand side of said brake pedal while being urged 

toward said brake pedal and having a lateral reciprocating 
stroke; and a guide roller (16) arranged at the right-hand portion 

of said brake pedal while having its circumferential edge 
protruded above the brake pedal, 

   wherein the improvement comprises a spring (12) disposed on 
the floor of the vehicle below said brake pedal for urging the 

lower end portion of said brake pedal to this side, and wherein 
said accelerator lever (20) is arranged, when in a non-load 

state, at an inclination with respect to the axis of said brake 
pedal. 
A pedal assembly according to claim 1, wherein said accelerator 
lever (20) includes an operating face (20a) curved in 

a recessed shape and mounted at an inclination in the downward 
direction. 
A pedal assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
guide roller (16) has its one end made polygonal and its other 

end made circular and is alternately formed with triangular arcuate 
recesses (16a) and flat faces (16b) or arcuate recesses 

(16c).
