<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
cartridge in use for ink providing jet function, an ink jet
cartridge, to an ink and also a method of ink jet recording, which
are applicable for devices including copying machines,
recording apparatus such as facsimile devices,
telecommunication instruments, composite instruments
thereof, and printers.An ink jet cartridge in use for an ink jet device is
normally integrally formed with an ink jet head. In most
cases, such a conventional cartridge is replaced together
with the used head, when the cartridge is reached the step
at which the ink will not be injected. A comparatively
large amount of ink is still remaining in the cartridge,
because of being governed by ink retention ability of
sponge material which is contained in the cartridge.In a cartridge of the above type, such as disclosed
in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 63-87242
a foam material is enclosed in the cartridge, which is
integral with an ink jet recording head furnished with a
plurality of ink injecting orifices. As ink is contained 
in foam material such as polyurethane foam, a negative
pressure produced by capillarity of the foam achieves
conservation of the ink (i.e. prevention of ink leakage out
of the container). However, as the foam must be filled
over almost entirely within the ink chamber, the filling
quantity of ink is not only restricted, but also the amount
of ink remaining unused in the foam will increase. As a
result, there are needed several improvements in filling
effect and efficient use of the ink material. Also,
problems still remain in difficulty of detection of
remaining ink and possibility of ununiformity of injecting
property of ink.Another prior art discloses an ink jet cartridge
containing substantially solely an ink material. Japanese
laid-open patent publication No. 2-522 discloses an ink jet
head having an integral construction in which a few amount
of porous material is provided between an upper positioned
primary storage section in which a large amount of ink is
contained and a lower positioned ink jet head. According
to the description, an advantage is mentioned that, because
the porous material is not enclosed in the ink storage
section but disposed only in an ink passage, the using
efficiency of ink is increased. Another advantage is also
mentioned that it is possible to tentatively store the ink
flown out of the primary ink storage section due to
temperature rise of the enclosed air (and pressure decrease
thereby) by providing a secondary ink storage
