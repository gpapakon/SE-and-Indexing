<ABSTRACT>
An f-theta lens includes three lenses in two groups. 
The first lens group from the entrance pupil side 

consists of a first lens having a 
negative or positive refracting power. The second lens 

group consists of a second lens having a positive 
refracting power and a third lens having a negative 

refracting power with the second and third lenses being 
cemented together. The second lens group has a positive 

refracting power as a whole. The following formulae (1) 
to (4) are satisfied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an f lens for a
scanning optical system, and more particularly to an f
lens suitable for use in a scanning optical system in
which a plurality of laser beams having different
wavelengths are used.Recently there has been put into wide use various
instruments such as a laser beam printer in which a laser
beam scanning optical system is used. In such an optical
system, an f lens is used to cause a laser beam, which
is deflected by a rotary polygonal mirror or the like, to
scan the surface of a medium at a constant speed. The f
lens is a lens which satisfies a condition that Y=f
wherein  represents the incident angle of the laser beam
to the lens, f represents the focal length of the lens
and Y represents the height of the image formed.Conventionally the f lens is designed on the
assumption that a monochromatic or single wavelength
laser beam is used and accordingly the color aberration
causes no problem and correction of the color aberration
has been unnecessary heretofore.However, for instance, in a laser recording
system in which color images are recorded on silver salt
film by use of a plurality of laser beams having
different wavelengths, e.g., red, green and blue laser 
beams, the problem of color aberration must be taken into
account. As is well known in the art, the color
aberration includes the axial color aberration and the
lateral color aberration. The axial color aberration
shifts the position of the image in the direction of the
optical axis depending on the wavelength and practically
does not cause a serious problem since the focal depth of
the laser beam is sufficiently large. However, the
lateral color aberration causes the position of the image
to shift in the direction perpendicular to the optical
axis depending on the wavelength, and accordingly, the
beam is shifted in the scanning direction by different
distance depending on the wavelength, which makes it
impossible to precisely superimpose the spots of the
respective colors one on another and adversely affects
the quality of images.Though this problem may be overcome by operating
the laser beams of the respective colors in different
timings, this approach requires complicated control and
is not suitable for high-speed scanning.In Japanese Patent Publication No. 61(1986)-51289,
there is disclosed a technique for correcting
lateral color aberration. However this technique can
correct lateral color aberration only by a wavelength of
20nm and is originally developed to correct color
aberration due to
