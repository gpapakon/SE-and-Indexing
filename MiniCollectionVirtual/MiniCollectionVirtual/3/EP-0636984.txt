<ABSTRACT>
In a computer comprising a processor (1) connected to memories (2) by an addressing bus, a data bus and lines for transmitting check signals, which executes a programme consisting of procedures, each procedure when executing using in particular specific variables which are grouped together in one area of the memories (2), the device according to the invention comprises an automatic handler (6) connected to the processor (1) so as to receive the check signals, the data and the addresses flowing between the processor (1) and the said memory area, this automatic handler (6) being connected up to two other memories (4, 5) so as to apply to them, in parallel with the processor (1), all the write and read operations applied to the said memory area. The invention applies in particular to computers carried on board aerodynes.

<CLAIMS>
Method for controlling data manipulated by a 
computer comprising a processor (1) connected to 

memories (2) via an addressing bus (23), a data bus 
(22) and control signal transmission lines (9), the 

processor (1) executing a programme comprised of 
procedures, each of the procedures being executed 

notably using variables specific to it and which are 
grouped together in a first memory zone,
 
characterized in that it comprises, upon execution of a 

procedure: 

the reading by an automaton (6) outside of the 
processor (1), of the control signals, data and 

addresses specific to the data used specifically by 
the procedure in transit between the processor (1) and 

the first memory zone, 
the application, by the automaton, of these control 
signals to at least two other memory zones (4, 5), 
if these control signals correspond to a memory write 
command, the writing of the datum read on the data bus 

(22), at the address read on the addressing bus (23), 
simultaneously in the other memory zones (4, 5), 
if these control signals correspond to a read 
command, the simultaneous reading of the data stored 

respectively in the other memory zones (4, 5) at the 
address read on the addressing bus (23), the 

comparison of these data with one another and with the 
datum read on the data bus (22), and if all these data 

are not identical, the transmission of an interrupt 
signal to the processor (1) which can then decide 

which datum it should take into account. 
Method as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that it comprises, upon storage of a 

datum in each of the other memory zones (4, 5), storage  
 

in the latter of a presence bit positioned in the logic 
"1" state, associated with said datum. 
Method as claimed in claim 2,
 
characterized in that it comprises the erasing of all 

the data stored in the other memory zones (4, 5), and 
the zeroizing of all the associated presence bits, upon 

activation of a procedure by the processor (1). 
Device for implementing the method as claimed 
in any one of the previous claims,
 
characterized in that it comprises an automaton (6) and 

two image spaces (4, 5) of a zone of the memory of the 
computer (2) and of which the size corresponds to the 

maximum cumulative size of the local data manipulated 
at a given moment, the automaton comprising: 


a control block (24) connected to the control signal 
(RD, WR) transmission lines between the processor (1) 

and its memory (2), and intended to command the other 
devices of the automaton (6), 
two internal data buses (30, 31) connected, on the 
one hand, respectively to the image spaces (4, 5), 

and, on the other hand, to the data bus (22) of the 
processor (1) respectively via two bidirectional 

buffer gateways (27, 28), 
one internal addressing bus (29) connected, on the 
one hand, to the two image spaces (4, 5), and, on the 

other hand, to the addressing bus (23) of the 
processor (1) via a buffer gateway (26), and 
three comparators (37, 33, 34) which, when commanded 
by the control block, respectively compare the data 

present on the internal buses with one another as well 
as with the datum present on the data bus (22) of the 

processor (1), and which inscribe the result of these 
comparisons in a status register (25), and 
a means for generating an interrupt signal (IT)  
 

addressed to the processor (1) when the status 
register (25) indicates that an error has been 

detected. 
Device as claimed in claim 4,
 
characterized in that the automaton (6) comprises: 


two blocks (40, 41) for presetting the presence bit 
to "1", intended to set to "1" the presence bit 

respectively associated with the data when they are 
written in the image spaces (4, 5), and 
two presence bit testers (32, 35) which, when 
commanded by the control block (24), respectively test 

the presence bits associated with the two data 
respectively present on the two internal data buses 

(30, 31), and which inscribe the result of the tests 
in the status register (25). 
Device as claimed in claim 4 or 5,
 
characterized in that the automaton (6) comprises two 

devices for presetting to "0" (36, 38) associated with 
an address generator (39) capable of browsing through 

all the addresses in the image spaces (4, 5) which, 
when commanded by the control block (24), respectively 

set to "0" all the data stored in the two image spaces 
(4, 5), as well as the presence bit associated 

therewith. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6,

connected to the addressing bus (23) of the processor 
(1) capable of generating the following signals 

intended for the control block (24) of the automaton

a signal (LOCAL) indicating that the processor (1) 
has triggered a read or write operation on a datum 

local to the procedure being executed,

and associated presence bit stored in the two image 
spaces (4, 5), 
a signal (CS3) indicating reading of the status
