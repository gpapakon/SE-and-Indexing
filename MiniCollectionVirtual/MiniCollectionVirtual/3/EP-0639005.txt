<ABSTRACT>
A fast turn-off solid-state relay (20) or the like has a photodiode array (6) for 
controlling the conductivity of an output transistor (2,3). A JFET switch (14) closes 

to discharge the gate of the output transistor (2,3) when the photodiode array (6) stops 
producing current. A bipolar transistor switch (12), upon detecting the JFET switch 

(14) closure, discharges the photodiode array (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid-state relays generally and, more 
particularly, to the drive circuits therefore. Solid-state relays are widely used in a variety of applications formally 
the domain of electromagnetic relays. However, the speed at which the solid-state 
relay operates may be too slow for some uses. Usually the turn-on time of the relay 
is adequate (approximately 100 µs or less) but the turn-off time of prior art relay can 
be an order of magnitude slower. Thus, it is desirable to provide a solid-state relay with faster turn-off 
time than prior art relays. It is a further desirable to provide a fast turn-off time relay without 
significantly impacting the turn-on time of the relay or external characteristics of the 
relay and without complex circuitry. These and other aspects of the invention may be obtained generally in 
accordance with claim 1. The foregoing features of this invention, as well as the invention itself, 
may be more fully understood from the following detailed description of the 
drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic diagram of the preferred embodiment of 
the invention. The invention may by referred to generally in a solid state relay 20 
having: a control signal generator 6; at least one output transistor 2, 3 having an 
input terminal and two output terminals, the output terminals coupling to the relay 
20 output 4, 4', the input terminal coupling to the control signal generator 6; and a 
first switch 14 for shunting the input terminal of the output transistor 2, 3 to a first 
one of the two output terminals 11 of the output transistor upon substantial removal 
of the control signal, thereby discharging the input terminal. The relay 20 is 
characterized by: a second switch 12, responsive to the first switch 14, for 
discharging the control signal generator 6 while the first switch 14 discharges the 
input terminal of the output transistor 2, 3. The control signal determines whether  
 
the relay is conducting or non-conducting. In more detail, the relay 20 is similar to the prior art relay 1 of FIG. 1: it 
has output transistors 2, 3 coupled to the output terminals 4, 4' of the relay 20; and a 
PDA 6 illuminated by LED array 7 coupled to the input terminals 8, 8' of the relay 
20. Circuit arrangement 9 includes an additional transistor 12 which assists in 
discharging the PDA 6 when the transistor 14 discharges the gates of transistors 2, 3, 
as will be discussed below. The relay 20 uses series connected MOS transistors 2, 3 to selectively 
provide a
