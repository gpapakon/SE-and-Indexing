<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus for 
recognizing the shape of a semiconductor wafer, capable 

of stably achieving accurate shape recognition without 
being affected by either a circuit pattern formed on the 

semiconductor wafer or the color of an adhesive sheet 
attached to a frame for adhering to the semiconductor 

wafer. The shape recognizing apparatus for recognizing 
the shape of a semiconductor wafer in accordance with 

the present invention comprises an image pickup means 
(3) for picking up an image of the semiconductor wafer 

(100) and providing video signals representing the image, 
the image pickup means being opposite to the 

semiconductor wafer, and a shape recognizing means (6) 
for recognizing the shape of the semiconductor wafer by 

processing the video signals. The shape recognizing 
apparatus is characterized in that ; it comprises an 

illuminating means (1) for illuminating a semiconductor 
wafer and transmitting light through the adhesive sheet 

(102) with the semiconductor wafer, the illuminating 
means (1) is disposed opposite to the image pickup 

means (3), and the semiconductor wafer (100) is 
interposed between the illuminating means and the image 

pickup means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
recognizing the shape of a semiconductor wafer, capable 
of automatically recognizing the shape of a 
semiconductor wafer when the semiconductor wafer is 
being processed on a dicing apparatus or the like so 
that the dicing apparatus or the like can process and 
handle the semiconductor wafer accurately and 
efficiently according to the shape of the semiconductor 
wafer even if the semiconductor wafer is cracked or 
chipped. After fabricating a plurality of semiconductor 
chips on the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the 
semiconductor chips are inspected with an IC tester 
provided with a prober and the semiconductor wafer is 
diced by a dicing apparatus. In the art of 
automatically processing the semiconductor wafer, 
automatization has been developed in order to align the 
semiconductor wafer automatically and perform various 
processes on an assumption that the semiconductor wafer 
is circular. The following explanation will be made in 
connection with a dicing apparatus by way of example. 
The dicing apparatus cuts narrow grooves in the surface 
of the semiconductor wafer with a cutting blade rotating 
at a high speed, which is widely used for cutting the 
semiconductor wafer into semiconductor chips. The pattern of the semiconductor chips fabricated 
on the surface of the semiconductor wafer cannot be 
correctly positioned relative to the working position 
of the cutting blade by simply mounting the 
semiconductor wafer on the stage and hence the grooves 
cannot be accurately cut along desired lines on the  
 
semiconductor wafer without adjusting the position of 
the semiconductor wafer relative to the cutting blade. 
The position of the semiconductor wafer relative to the 
working position of the cutting blade is adjusted by 
moving the stage supporting the semiconductor wafer 
into the field of view of an image pickup device and 
aligning a specified position on the semiconductor wafer 
with a specified position in the field of view of a 
projector. The projector, namely the image pickup 
device, is located beforehand at a predetermined 
position relative to the working position of the 
cutting blade. After thus determining the positional 
relation between the specified position on the surface 
of the semiconductor wafer and the working position of 
the cutting blade, the stage is moved by a precision 
stage moving mechanism to cut grooves accurately along 
the desired lines on the semiconductor wafer. The 
operation to adjust the position
