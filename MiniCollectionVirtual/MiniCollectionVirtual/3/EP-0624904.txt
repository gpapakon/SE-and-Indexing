<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer wiring board has at least one stacking block 
with an insulating hard substrate, a grounding layer being 

provided in the insulating hard substrate. A plurality of wiring 
layers are provided over upper and lower major surfaces of the 

insulating hard substrate. A plurality of throughholes are 
provided in the insulating hard substrate for connecting wiring 

layers on the top and bottom surfaces of the substrate. A base 
block has an insulating base board, and at least one wiring layer 

provided over one major surface of the insulating base board. 
Connections electrically and mechanically connect the at least 

one stacking block and the base block. The stacking block and 
the base block may be simultaneously manufactured in parallel 

with others. The stacking block and the base block may be 
adhered to each other by an adhesive layer. Each electrical 

connection between the stacking block and the base block may be 
achieved with bumps and pads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wiring board and a
manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly to a multi-layer
wiring board having multiple wiring layers using polyimide
resin for inter-layer insulation, and a manufacturing method
thereof.Multi-layer printed wiring boards have been used heretofore
as wiring boards on which to mount LSI chips.A multiple printed wiring board has copper-sputtered stacked
plates as a core and prepregs as a adhesive for connection
between the copper-sputtered stacked plates, and the copper-sputtered
stacked plates and prepregs are alternately stacked and
integrated by thermal press processes.Electrical connections between the copper-sputtered stacked
plates are achieved by forming penetrating throughholes with a
drill after the copper-sputtered stacked plates and prepregs are
integrated, and coating the inner walls of the penetrating
throughholes with copper.Furthermore, in recent years, multi-layer wiring boards
using polyimide resin over ceramic substrates for inter-layer
insulation have come to be used as wiring boards for high 
performance computer use, where greater density than that of
multi-layer printed wiring boards is required.A polyimide ceramic multi-layer wiring board which has
polyimide resin insulating layers and multiple wiring layers is
formed by the repetition of the following two processes.Polyimide resin insulating layers are formed by supplying
polyimide precursor varnish over a ceramic substrate, drying it
and forming via holes in this coating film over the ceramic
substrate.Multiple wiring layers are formed by photolithographic
methods, vacuum evaporation methods, and metal plating methods.On the other hand, there also is a method to form a
polyimide ceramic multi-layer wiring board by forming conductor
lines as a signal layer over polyimide sheets, aligning these
sheets over a ceramic substrate, and successively alternately
stacking and pressing the sheets over the ceramic substrate.However, the above-mentioned multi-layer wiring boards have
some disadvantages as follows.For the above-mentioned multiple printed wiring board, since
electrical connections between the copper-sputtered stacked
plates are achieved by penetrating throughholes which are formed
through from the top printed wiring board to the bottom printed
wiring board with a drill, it is impossible to form physically
minute penetrating throughholes in the signal wiring layer part
of the multiple printed wiring board, and accordingly it is
impossible to form many conductor lines
