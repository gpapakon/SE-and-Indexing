A process for the compression of powdered substances 
to a given bulk density range, wherein the powdered 

structure of the powder is preserved, characterised in 
that the powdered substance is hermetically enclosed 

in a receptacle having a flexible wall (4) impermeable 
to gases; this receptacle is enclosed in a closed 

pressure vessel (5); the space between the outer wall 
of the pressure vessel (5) and the receptacle is 

pressurised by means of compressed gas; the pressure 
is maintained for a definite period and then released 

and the powdered substance is optionally removed with 
the receptacle from the pressure vessel (5). 
A device for the compression of powdered substances to 
a given bulk density range, wherein the powdered 

structure of the powder is preserved, characterised in 
that it consists of a preferably vertically arranged 

pressure vessel (5) which has any, preferably a 
circular, cross-section, which has a hermetically 

sealable opening (2, 3) at both the upper and lower 
sides of the cross-section and which is provided 

internally with a flexible receptacle made of a 
material (4) impermeable to gases and likewise open 

above and below.
