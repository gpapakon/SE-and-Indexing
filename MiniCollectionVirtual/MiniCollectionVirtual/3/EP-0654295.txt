<ABSTRACT>
The air to be purified is extracted by suction from a work space (2) and fed to at least two parallel active carbon adsorbers (10 to 13). Each adsorber can be switched back and forth between a loading mode in which it adsorbs the solvent vapours from the exhaust air flowing through it and a regeneration mode in which it is separated from the exhaust air stream and flushed with steam and desorbed. To save energy and reduce environmental pollution, it is provided that each adsorber at the end of the regeneration period passes through a drying phase in which exhaust air from the work space flows through the adsorber, which exhaust air is then fed to an adsorber operating in the loading mode. In the periods in which an adsorber operates in the loading mode, it initially passes through a start phase which is followed by a main phase, air streams from the adsorbers in the main phase being returned directly to the work space, while the air stream from an adsorber in the start phase is kept separate from the first-mentioned air streams.

A method for removing solvent vapor from exhaust air 
which is sucked out of a working space (2), wherein the 

air is cleaned by means of at least two activated 
carbon adsorbers (10, 11, 12, 13) which are in mutually 

parallel relationship and each of which runs through 
operating cycles which each comprise a charging period 

in which the exhaust air flows through the adsorber 
(10, 11, 12, 13) and the adsorber adsorbs the solvent 

vapor contained in the exhaust air, and a regeneration 
period in which the adsorber (10, 11, 12, 13) is separated 

from the flow of exhaust air and water vapor flows 
through the adsorber to desorb and flush out the 

previously adsorbed solvent, wherein the working cycles 
of at least two adsorbers (10, 11, 12, 13) are displaced 

relative to each other in respect of time in such a 
way that at least one of the adsorbers (10, 11, 12, 13) 

is always working in the charging mode, thereby to 
achieve a continuous adsorption procedure, characterized 

in that each regeneration period includes a concluding 
drying phase in which, instead of water vapor, exhaust 

air from the working space (2) flows through the adsorber 
(10, 11, 12, 13) in question, the exhaust air after 

leaving said adsorber (10, 11, 12, 13) being fed to 
the at least one adsorber (10, 11, 12, 13) which in 

that period is working in the charging mode, and in 
that each charging period includes an initial phase 

and a subsequent main phase, which are determined by 
virtue of the fact that the hot and humid air flow 

issuing from an adsorber (10, 11, 12, 13) which is in  
 

the initial phase of a charging period is fed to a 
separate treatment while the air flow issuing from an 

adsorber (10, 11, 12, 13) which is in the main phase 
of a charging period is returned directly into the 

working space (2).

phase of the charging period is terminated when said 
temperature falls below a predeterminable limit value.

separte is cooled and thereafter returned into the 

working space (2). 
A method as set forth in any of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that an amount of fresh air which 

approximately corresponds to the amount of air 
expelled into the surrounding atmosphere is sucked 

in out of the surrounding atmosphere, is conditioned 
and fed to the working space (2). 
A method as set forth in claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that heat which is taken from the air expelled into 

the surrounding atmosphere is used to heat the fresh air 
which is sucked in from the surrounding atmosphere.

in that the conditioned fresh air which is sucked 

in out of the surrounding atmosphere is directly fed 
to the working space (2).
