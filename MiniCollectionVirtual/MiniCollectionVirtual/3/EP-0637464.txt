<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive type vertical grain milling machine (4) 
comprises a perforated cylindrical body (42) which serves to 

define an outer periphery of a grain milling chamber and 
which has a plurality of vertically arranged resistance 

members (53) projected radially into the grain milling chamber 
so as to impart resistances to motions of the grains in a 

circumferential direction of an abrasive type roll 
assembly, an amount of projections of each of the 

resistance members (53) being made to be adjustable, and 
further has projection amount adjusting mechanisms (45) for 

adjusting independently the respective amounts of 
projection in the radial direction of the plural 

resistance members (53) located in different vertical 
positions, and therefore, it is possible to adjust 

independently the resistance imparted to the motions of 
the grains within the grain milling chamber in each of 

the upstream-side region and downstream-side region of 
the grain milling chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an abrasive type vertical grain milling machine comprising:
an abrasive type grain milling roll assembly mounted on a main shaft extending straight in
a vertical direction; and a perforated cylindrical body extending vertically around said roll
assembly leaving a space therefrom so as to define a cylindrical grain milling chamber
around said roll assembly in cooperation with an outer peripheral surface of said roll
assembly and having a large number of holes through which bran produced in said grain
milling chamber is allowed to be released,
the grain milling chamber having a vertical one end where grains to be milled are introduced
and another end from where grains having been milled are discharged, said cylindrical body
comprises a plurality of vertically arranged resistance members projected radially into the
grain milling chamber so as to impart resistances to motions of the grains in a
circumferential direction of said roll assembly, an amount of projection of each of said
resistance members being made to be adjustable, and projection amount adjusting means
for adjusting independently the respective amounts of projection in the radial direction of
said plural resistance members located in different vertical positions, said cylindrical body
comprises a plurality of stanchions circumferentially spaced apart from each other and
extending substantially in the vertical direction, and perforated arcuate plate members,
disposed between the circumferentially adjacent stanchions and each forming a part of a
cylinder of said cylindrical body, and said plural stanchions so as to be located in different
vertical positions on a side of the associated stanchion facing to the grain milling chamber
through said projection amount adjusting means while being movable in the radial
direction of said roll assembly with respect to the associated stanchion.Such an abrasive type vertical grain milling machine is known from CH-A-280080. In a
grain milling machine, the grains to be milled, such as rice grains, are introduced into the
milling or whitening chamber from an upper end thereof. The grains are forcibly rotated in
a circumferential direction by the grain milling roll assembly. The rice grains rub against
each other and other surfaces thereof are scraped so that they are milled, or whitened.
Rubbing between the rice grains becomes more intense as the amount of the projection of
the resistance members is increased to impart a higher resistance to the movement of the
rice grains in a
