<ABSTRACT>
A stretchable film (F) is used whose width is 
substantially equal to that of the bottom of an article of 

the largest format which can be processed by the packaging 
machine. The film is characterized by considerable 

stretchability and a low elastic memory when stretched. 
The portion of film cyclically introduced into the 
wrapping station is normally subjected to longitudinal 

pre-stretching which has the function of decreasing the 
width of the film, and the extent of this pre-stretching is 

variable according to the dimensions of the article to be 
wrapped, so that the said portion of film has a width 

proportionate to the corresponding dimension of the article 
to be wrapped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus 
for wrapping with stretchable film articles having different 
dimensions to form packages automatically made proportionate 
to the sizes of the article, in which a portion of film is 
fed to a wrapping station, the article is lifted against 
said portion of film whose flaps are then folded and 
extended under tension onto the base of the article 
according to a sequence which terminates with the folding of 
a final flap onto previously folded flaps. In packaging machines of a known type, the wrapping film 
is unreeled from a roll and its width is generally matched 
to the smallest dimensions of the articles to be wrapped, to 
prevent the formation of random, disorganized and excessive 
overlapping of flaps of the film on the bottoms of the said 
articles of small dimensions, in order to avoid problems of 
an aesthetic and also a functional nature, particularly in 
relation to the heat-welding and sealing of the bottom of 
the wrapping, which is particularly necessary in the 
packaging of articles such as meat products, which may 
release liquid components over time. The larger widths of 
film, required for wrapping articles whose width or length 
is greater than the width of the film, are obtained by 
subjecting the said film to a suitable transverse 
pre-stretching proportionately to the dimensions of the  
 
article to be wrapped. It is evident that this condition 
limits the capacity of the machine to operate with articles 
varying over a wide range of dimensions, this being contrary 
to current market requirements which are for machines 
capable of operating automatically with articles of widely 
differing dimensions, without the need for adjustments or 
changes of format of the wrapping film. To overcome this disadvantage, a process and equipment 
described in Italian patent application No. BO93A000156 (identical 
to EP-A-0 620 151), in 
the name of the present applicant, have been devised, and 
provide for the use of stretchable film whose width is 
matched to the largest articles which the machine can wrap. 
For the packaging of articles having dimensions less than 
the maximum dimensions acceptable by the packaging machine, 
the width of the film is modified and matched in each 
individual case to the dimensions of the article to be 
wrapped, with a process and equipment for pleating, such 
that the longitudinal axis of the pleats is orientated in 
the direction of the length of the portion of film 
introduced into the wrapping station

<CLAIMS>
Process for wrapping with stretchable film articles 
having different dimensions to form packages automatically 

made proportionate to the sizes of the article, in which a 
portion of film is fed to a wrapping station, the article is 

lifted against said portion of film whose flaps are then 
folded and extended under tension onto the base of the 

article according to a sequence which terminates with the 
folding of a final flap onto previously folded flaps, said 

stretchable film having a width which is proportionate to 
that of the largest size of article which can be handled in 

the wrapping operation, comprising the phase of measuring 
the dimensions of the article to be wrapped, characterized 

by the fact that the portion of film cyclically introduced 
into the wrapping station is subjected to longitudinal 

pre-stretching to decrease the width of the film, the extent 
of the pre-stretching being variable according to the 

dimensions of the article to be wrapped, so that the said 
portion of film has a width proportionate to the 

corresponding dimension of the article to be wrapped. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized by the 
use of stretchable film whose width is suitably greater than 

that of the bottoms of the articles of largest format which 
can be handled by the packaging machine, so that, even for 

the wrapping of these articles, the film is subjected to a 
sufficient phase of longitudinal pre-stretching which 

appropriately matches the width to that of the said 
articles.  

 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the phase of longitudinal prestretching of the film 

precedes the phase of introduction of the film into the 
wrapping station of the packaging machine and these phases 

are not dependent on each other. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized by the 
use of stretchable film of considerable stretchability and 

with low elastic memory when stretched, for example film of 
polyethylene or other suitable material which has similar 

properties. 
An apparatus for wrapping with stretchable film 
articles having different dimensions to form packages 

automatically made proportionate to the sizes of the 
article, in which a portion of film is fed to a wrapping 

station, the article is lifted against said portion of film 
whose flaps are then folded and extended under tension onto 

the base of the article according to a sequence which 
terminates with the folding of a final flap onto previously 

folded flaps, said stretchable film having a width which is 
proportionate to that of the largest size of articles which 

can be handled in the wrapping operation, characterized by 
the fact of comprising: 


measuring means (5-105) which measure the dimensions of 
the article (P) fed to the wrapping station of the machine 

and which transmit these data to at least one computer or 
processing unit (6) which controls the operation of the 

apparatus; 
means which operate between the film feed roll (B) and the  
 

wrapping station of the packaging machine and are controlled 
by the said computer, to subject the portion of film which 

has to be introduced from time to time into the said station 
for the wrapping of an article, to a longitudinal 

pre-stretching operation which modifies its width according 
to the dimensions of the article to be wrapped, so that the 

portion of film fed to the said station and held at one end 
by a dispenser (30) and at the other end by a clamp (61) 

movable with respect to the said dispenser, has a width 
matched on an individual basis to that of the article to be 

wrapped. 
An apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the means of longitudinal pre-stretching comprise at 

least two pairs of rollers (12-112 and 13-113) which are 
parallel and superimposed on each other, in which each pair 

of rollers comprises a stationary roller (12-13), covered 
with or made from a material and/or a treatment such that 

its surface has a sufficiently high coefficient of friction 
in relation to the film, for example a rubber coating, these 

rollers being connected to any suitable power source 
controlled by the computer (6), while the other rollers 

(112-113) are smooth, being made of steel for example, are 
pushed by elastic means (15-16) against the preceding 

rollers, and have a disposition such that the film has to be 
run around the rubber rollers so that it contacts a large 

portion of the circumference, the two pairs of rollers being 
driven at different speeds, so that the portion of film 

lying between them is subjected to the necessary 
longitudinal pre-stretching and consequently to the  

 
necessary variation in width. 
An apparatus according to claim 6 characterized in 
that one pair of pre-stretching rollers (13-113) is located 

at a short distance from and parallel to the comb-like 
dispenser (30) in which the end of the wrapping film is held 

from time to time, and the said pair of rollers is 
cyclically driven with a peripheral speed substantially 

equal to the linear speed of movement of the rear clamp (61) 
which initially introduces the film into the wrapping 

station and which then, with the attached folder (52), folds 
on to the bottom of the article the rear flap (L3) of the 

film and with the attached pusher (55) pushes the article to 
discharge it, while the final flap (L4) of film is folder on 

to its bottom, the other pair of pre-stretching rollers 
(12-112) being made to be suitably spaced from the prece
ding 
pair of rollers and being operated in such a manner that the 

portion of film running between the two pairs of rollers is 
subjected to the longitudinal pre-stretching which is 

necessary in each individual case for matching to the 
dimensions of the article to be wrapped. 
An apparatus according to claim 7 characterized in 
that it comprises means by which the pair of pre-stretching 

rollers (13-113) near the dispenser (30) is operated 
concurrently with the return movement of the rear clamp (61) 

which introduces a new portion of film into the wrapping 
station of the packaging machine, means being provided to 

operate the said rollers when the pusher (52) associated 
with the said clamp, at the conclusion of a wrapping cycle,  

 
starts to move the article to discharge it or with a precise 

delay after this start, according to whether the article has 
to be handled delicately or not. 
An apparatus according to claim 6 characterized in 
that the rubber-coated rollers (12-13) of the pairs of 

pre-stretching rollers are operated by corresponding 
electric motors (17-18), at an electronically controlled 

speed, connected with a suitable interface to the computer 
(6) responsible for the automatic operation of the packaging 

machine.
