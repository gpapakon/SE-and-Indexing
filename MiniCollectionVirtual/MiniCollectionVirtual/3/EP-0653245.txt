<ABSTRACT>
A bracket for shock mounting of a vibrating 
or rotating device, such as a centrifuge, to a support 

surface. The bracket is formed from a plate of stiff 
material, such as steel, having an expandible deformable 

section along a lengthwise axis of the plate and a rotationally 
deformable leg section formed by undulations in 

the plate from one end to the other. At narrower plate 
regions, formed by the undulations, plate rotation is 

possible until the plate exceeds its elastic limit in the 
rotational direction and permanent deformation occurs. 

Such permanent deformation absorbs energy from accidents 
within the device in which energy would otherwise be 

transferred to a support surface and the surrounding 
environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to safety mountings for 
a table top spinning or vibrating device, such as a 
centrifuge. Benchtop instruments which vibrate and spin can 
sometimes work themselves loose from table top mountings 
and crash upon users or upon delicate laboratory equipment. 
Of particular concern are centrifuges which store 
large amounts of rotational energy in ordinary operation. 
If a centrifuge spindle or rotor fails, a centrifuge rotor 
must dissipate large amounts of energy to a storage 
container which, in turn, transfers energy through its 
mountings to a table top. Standards have been developed, 
for example, by the International Electrotechnical Commission 
for Most Credible Accident (MCA) Tests. According 
to one safety specification, IEC 1010-2, an instrument 
undergoing an MCA test must stay within a 300 millimeter 
envelope and the instrument door must stay closed. A bracket in accord with the prior art is shown 
in Fig. 3. A generally triangular plate 12 has an apex 
14 with an aperture 16 through which a bolt 18 passes 
for connection with a table top, sometimes also passing 
through a grommet 20, a centering sleeve 22 and a washer 
24. At the base of the triangular plate 12 a pair of 
bolts, such as bolt 26 passes through opposite apertures 
28 and 30 to fasten plate 12 to an instrument such as a 
centrifuge. In the event of an accident, the plate 
merely transfers energy from the instrument directly to 
the table top with a slight amount of cushioning or shock 
absorption by means of grommet 20.  
 US-A-2882748 relates to a connecting link for vibrating bodies. The link is provided 
with a slot positioned between the ends of the link which are connected to the 
respective vibrating bodies, the slot being substantially perpendicular to the access of 
the link. During vibration, the link flexes thereby extending or compressing the slot 
depending upon the direction of relative motion to absorb the energy of the vibration.  
 An object of the present invention was to 
satisfy the above-identified safety standard, while 
providing a mounting bracket which is simple and compact. According to one aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a safety bracket for shock 
mounting of a vibrating or twisting apparatus to a support 
surface comprising: 
a plate having a head section connected to a 
neck, in turn connected to a shoulder section, in turn 
connected to a trunk, in turn connected to a torso section, 
the neck and trunk being laterally narrower than said head, 
shoulder and

A safety bracket for shock mounting of a vibrating or 
twisting apparatus to a support surface comprising: 


a plate having a head section connected to a neck, 
in turn connected to a shoulder section, in turn connect to 

a trunk, in turn connected to a torso section, the neck and 
trunk being laterally narrower than said head, shoulder and 

torso sections and serving to join adjacent sections 
aligned along a lengthwise axis, 
said shoulder section being a loop which is 
restorably compressible in the lengthwise direction and said 

torso section being rotationally bendable about a point on 
the lengthwise axis to an extent before permanently 

deforming, 
said head and torso sections having respective 
means for mounting a portion of a vibrating or twisting 

apparatus to support surface in a parallel relation. 
A bracket according to claim 1 wherein said torso 
section comprises a pair of legs extending outwardly from 

said lengthwise axis in opposite directions. 
A bracket according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said torso 
section comprises a second loop which is extendible in the 

lengthwise direction. 
A bracket according to claim 1, 2 
&
 3 wherein said 
bracket is symmetric about said lengthwise axis. 
A bracket according to any one of the receding claims, 
wherein said head section has a truncated triangular shape. 
A bracket according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said neck and trunk have equal widths. 
A bracket according to claim 2 or any one of the claims 
3-6 when dependent upon claim 2 wherein said means for  

 
mounti
ng comprises an aperture defined in said head section 
and a pair of space apart apertures defined in opposed legs. 
A bracket according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said means for mounting comprises a first aperture 

defined in said head section and second aperture along the 
lengthwise axis distal to the first aperture. 
A bracket according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the loops of plate material symmetric is/are about 

the lengthwise axis. 
A safety bracket system for shock mounting of a 
centrifuge to a support surface, said system comprising: 


a centrifuge having an access door to a rotor 
containment cavity, said door being secured by a latch 

having a predetermined maximum acceptable shock load before 
opening, 
a plate having a base edge spaced from a head 
section along a lengthwise axis, the base edge hving means 

for mounting to a side of the centrifuge and the head 
section having means for mounting to a support surface, a 

rotationally deformable plate section with a centre of 
rotation along the lengthwise axis and 
a cut-out plate region between said base edge and 
said head section defining an aperture having lateral end 

portions on opposite sides of said lengthwise axis, said end 
portions being defined by laterally extending narrow rims of 

plate material, said rims having an axial stiffness along 
said lengthwise axis such that permanent deformation of said 

plate rims during a rotor failure reduces the shock load 
transmitted to said centrifuge, including the door latch, to 

a value less then said maximum acceptable shock load. 
A safety bracket system according to claim 10 wherein 
said plate structure has an axial stiffness of from about 

2,000 lbs per inch to about 50,000 lbs per inch.
