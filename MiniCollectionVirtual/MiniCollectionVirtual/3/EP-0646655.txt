essentially consisting of 1.5 to 3.5% by weight of Mg, 
0.3 to 1.0% by weight of Cu, 0.05 to 0.35% by weight of 

Si, 0.03 to 0.5% by weight of Fe, 0.005 to 0.15% by 
weight of Ti, 0.0002 to 0.05% by weight of B and a 

balance of Aℓ, in which the ratio of Mg/Cu is in the 
range of 2 to 7, homogenizing the ingot in one step or 

in multiple steps, performed at a temperature within the 
range of 400 to 580°C, preparing an alloy sheet having a 

desired sheet thickness by subjecting the ingot to a hot 
rolling and a cold rolling, subjecting the alloy sheet 

to a heat treatment including heating the sheet up to a 
range of 500 to 580°C at a heating rate of 3°C/second or 

more, keeping it at the temperature reached for 0 to 60 
seconds, and cooling at a cooling rate of 2°C/second or 

more, subjecting the alloy sheet to a preliminary aging 
treatment performed at a temperature within the range of 

45 to 100°C for 2 to 48 hours after keeping at room 
temperature or immediately after the heat treatment, 

and subjecting the alloy sheet to a restoring treatment 
performed at a temperature within the range of 180 to 

300°C for 3 to 60 seconds. Thus, a natural aging-retardated

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing an aluminum alloy sheet, more 
particularly, to a method of manufacturing an aluminum 
alloy sheet having excellent formability and excellent 
bake hardenability, having natural aging retardation 
property exhibiting no change in strength with time 
prior to being subjected to press forming, the sheet being suitable 
for use in an automobile body sheet. A conventional surface-treated cold-rolled steel 
sheet has frequently been used as a sheet material for 
automobile body panel. In recent years, however, for 
the purpose of reducing fuel consumption, a light-weight 
automobile body panel material has been demanded. To 
satisfy the demand, an aluminum alloy sheet has begun 
being used for the automobile body panel. The Japanese patent publication JP-A-4304339 discloses an 
aluminum alloy sheet for press forming having a composition 
comprising Mg, Cu, Si, Fe, Ti, B, Zn with a balance of 
aluminum. The sheet is formed by homogenizing an ingot 
material of the above composition at 450°C to 580°C, 
whereafter the ingot is hot rolled and cold rolled to 
obtain the desired sheet thickness. The resulting sheet is 
heated to a temperature of 440°C to 580°C, held there for 
less than 120 seconds, and then cooled down to 100°C. The Japanese patent publication JP-A-4365834 discloses an 
aluminum alloy sheet having a composition comprising Mg, 
Si, Cu, Fe, Tf, B and a balance of aluminum. The 
composition has a structure where the average aspect ratio 
of the crystalline grains is equal to or less than 3. The 
prepared ingot is subject to a homogenizing treatment at a 
temperature of 450°C to 580°C, whereafter sheets are rolled 
to a desired thickness by means of hot rolling and cold 
rolling. The resulting sheet is subjected to a heating 
treatment by heating to 440°C to 580°C, held at this 
temperature for less than 120 seconds, and then cooling 
down to 100°C. Nowadays, manufacturers in press forming of panel 
sheets are requesting that the material not only have 
low yield strength until being subjected to press 
forming so as to provide a satisfactory shape-retaining 
property [Jidosha Gijyutu (Automobile Technology), 
Vol. 45, No. 6 (1991), 45)], but also have a property 
such that strength can be improved during paint 
baking to provide satisfactory formability of deep 
drawing and overhang, and dent resistance. Under these circumstances, an attempt has been made  
  
 
in which the strength of the material was improved by 
adding Cu and Zn to a
