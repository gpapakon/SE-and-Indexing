<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated
semiconductor devices. In particular, it relates to
semiconductor devices having resistor and capacitor (RC)
networks integrated with Schottky diodes on a single
semiconductor substrate.In the past, RC networks and Schottky diodes have been
used together in filter circuits. Such filter circuits are
typically used to reduce electromagnetic and radio frequency
interference (EMI/RFI) produced by computers and computer
accessories.These computers and accessories are routinely operated
only a short distance away from telecommunication equipment.
For example, a personal computer is often operated in close
proximity to a television set and computers in police cars
are operated side by side with police communication gear.
Many of these computers have high clock rates and digital
signals whose rise and fall times are extremely short. In
addition, many computer accessories operate at similarly high
speeds. For example, memory cards, video accelerator cards,
modems, fax boards, co-processor cards, and data compression
hardware all operate at very high frequencies. As a result, 
the high speed data lines in these computers and accessories
produce EMI/RFI.Without additional counter measures, these popular and
widespread computers and accessories would contaminate the
air waves and interfere with communication equipment. For
example, cordless telephones, cellular telephones, radios,
televisions, and burglar alarms could all be affected.
Furthermore, important non-communication equipment, like
pacemakers or other medical equipment, could also be
impacted.Therefore, it is desirable to have counter measures
which suppress the EMI/RFI produced by the high speed data
lines in computers and computer accessories. However, it is
also desirable that such counter measures are inexpensive,
occupy little space, ensure proper testing, and produce only
small delays.In the past, several techniques have been used for
shielding high speed data lines. However, these methods have
not proven to be effective at optimizing cost, size, ease
of testing, minimization of delays, and suppression of
EMI/RFI.One method has utilized metallic shielding with feed
through capacitors coupled to the high speed data lines.
However, this method is expensive. Furthermore, it is no
longer feasible in light of the need for portable computers
and computer accessories and the availability of light weight
plastic enclosures.Another method has been to simply use low pass
integrated RC filters produced by
