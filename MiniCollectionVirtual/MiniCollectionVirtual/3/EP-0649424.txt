<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel therapeutic
agents and, in particular, to novel substituted
cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-diones, to processes for their
preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing
them and to their therapeutic activity in the treatment
of cardiovascular diseases.Angiotensin II is a key mediator of the renin-angiotensin
system. It is known that angiotensin II is
an arterial vasconstrictor that exerts its action by
interacting with specific receptors on cell membranes.
Recently, several non-peptide compounds have been
reported as angiotensin II antagonists and as useful
antihypertensive agents.Certain substituted 1,2-diaminocyclobutene-3,4-diones:
wherein one amine group has the formula
-NH(CH2)nZ(CH2)m-A in which n = 2 to 5, Z represents
sulphur, oxygen or methylene and A is aminoalkyl
substituted phenyl, thienyl, pyridyl or furyl and the
other amine group has the formula -NR1R2 in which R1 and
R2 are hydrogen or lower alkyl or R1 is hydrogen and R2
is inter alia allyl, propargyl, substituted
phenylalkylene or substituted pyridylalkylene; are
disclosed in EP 99122 as being histamine H2- receptor
antagonists.Other substituted 1,2-diaminocyclobutene-3,4-diones
in which one amino group is substituted by a substituted
benzopyran-3-ol group or a substituted 2H-pyrano[3,2-c]-pyridin-3-ol
group are disclosed as having blood-pressure
lowering activity in EP 426,379. The present invention provides compounds of formula
II
wherein R310 is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl;A190 is oxygen, sulphur or a group of the formula
-NR319- wherein R319 is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl;R311, R312, R313 and R314 are each independently
hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4
alkoxy, nitro, cyano, carboxy, C2-4 alkoxycarbonyl, C1-4
alkylthio, C1-4 alkylsulphinyl, C1-4 alkylsulphonyl,
phenyl (optionally substituted by C1-4 alkyl, C1-4
alkoxy, fluoro, chloro or bromo), C1-4
alkylsulphonylamino or C1-6 alkylamino-sulphonyl; R315
is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl; and R316, R317 and R318 are
each independently hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, nitro, fluoro,
chloro, bromo, cyano, formyl or a group of the formula
-SOgR320, -SO2NR321R322 or -COR323 (wherein R320, R321,
R322 are each independently hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, g is
1 or 2 and R323 is C1-4 alkyl or a group of the formula
-OR324 or -NR325R326 wherein R324, R325 and R326 are
