<ABSTRACT>
Purpose: To realize a type of thin film with excellent 
embedding characteristics, good control of thin film 

thickness, low dielectric constant, very low 
hygroscopicity, and excellent compressive stress. 
Configuration: A first formation layer (L1) with excellent 
compressive stress is formed from the TEOS gas using the 

PECVD method; a second formation layer (L2) with a lower 
compressive stress yet excellent embedding characteristics, 

low dielectric constant, and other excellent properties is 
formed from a gas mixture of TEOS gas and halogen gas using 

the PECVD method; these first and second formation layers 
(L1, L2) are combined appropriately to form a laminate 

configuration made of several layers laminated to each 
other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the configuration of a type of thin 
film of semiconductor device formed on semiconductor 
substrate or other sample surface by means of plasma 
enhanced CVD, as well as a manufacturing method of the thin 
film. In the conventional method, in order to form a thin film on 
a sample surface, such as a semiconductor substrate, the 
plasma enhanced CVD method is usually used. In this method, 
a plasma is generated in the reaction container of a plasma 
enhanced CVD (referred to as PECVD hereinafter) apparatus, 
and the plasma discharge energy is used to activate the  
 
reaction gas, so that the deposit formed in the chemical 
vapor deposition of the reaction gas is coated on the 
sample surface to form the desired thin film. In this method, the reaction gas used for coating a SiO₂ 
thin film on the surface of a semiconductor substrate may 
be SiH₄ gas (silane type gas) or TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate) 
gas. In the recent years, with development of the VLSI, 
semiconductor devices with even higher integration density, 
it becomes very important to develop the formation 
technology of fine patterns of the order of submicrons. In 
this case, by means of the experimental verification of the 
shape of the thin film formed using the conventional CVD 
method, the possibility in using the conventional 
technology in the formation of submicron fine pattern of 
semiconductor device has been studied. Figures 5(a)-(f) are longitudinal cross-sectional views 
illustrating the process of formation of a SiO₂ thin film, 
in which plasma is generated between a pair of electrodes 
set facing each other in the reaction container of said 
PECVD device by means of rf electrical power at 13.56 MHz, 
and SiH₄ reaction gas is fed into the reaction container so 
as to form a SiO₂ thin film on the SiO₂ oxide film formed 
on the surface of the semiconductor substrate and the Al 
wiring formed on its surface. These drawings were prepared 
by tracing the corresponding micrographs. It can be seen from the aforementioned experimental results 
that for the SiO₂ thin film, the side surface has a convex 
round profile, and its head portion is wider than the 
bottom portion, so that the thin film profile corresponds 
to a poor embedding ability. Consequently, voids (gaps) may 
be formed in the vicinity of the bottom portion of the Al 
wiring. This is a disadvantage. In particular, this may  
 
lead to very serious problems in the case of submicron-size 
high-density wiring with a small gap between Al wiring 
portions
