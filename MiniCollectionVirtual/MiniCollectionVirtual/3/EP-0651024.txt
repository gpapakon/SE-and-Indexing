<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing polymethine dyes comprising the steps of: 

(a) reacting a 1,1-diaryl-2-metallo-ethene with an ω,ω,-diarylpolyalkene-aldehyde 
in an anhydrous solvent under an inert 

atmosphere; and 
(b) neutralizing the reaction mixture from step (a) with an acid, 
thereby producing a polymethine dye.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing certain tetra-aryl-polymethine 
compounds. These molecules are useful as dyes and sensitizers for thermographic, 
photographic and photothermographic recording materials. Polymethine dyes of formula I are well known in the art as having utility in 
recording materials responsive to a wide range of irradiative energy wavelengths, 
from thermal exposure to infrared to visible light. U.S. Patent No. 5,135,842 
describes the use of polymethine dyes in thermal dye bleach constructions for imaging 
and for antihalation layers. U.S. Patent No. 4,939,117 describes the preparation of 
pentamethine dyes and their use as leuco dyes. U.S. Patent No. 4,948,715 and 
European Patent Application No. 0,353,007 describe the preparation of of 
pentamethine dyes and their use in optical recording. In polymethine dyes of formula I, typically, A1- A4 and n are chosen so as 
to be responsive to particular wavelengths as appropriate for the recording to be done, 
and include amino groups, alkyl- and aryl-substituted amino groups, alkoxide groups, 
and other substituents which may advantageously contribute or donate electrons to the 
polymethine system. Usually, A1 and A2 are identical to each other, and A3 and A4 
are identical to each other, and often, due to the method of synthesis of the 
polymethine system, all four aromatic substituents A1- A4 are identical. Typically, 
n is 1, 2, or 3. The counterion X- can be any of a large number of appropriate 
anions derived from organic or inorganic acids.  
 
Mixtures of dyes exhibit mixed absorption spectra, which may not be useful 
in applications requiring absorption at a single, specific wavelength. Purification of 
mixtures of polymethine dyes obtained from strong acid-catalyzed condensation 
reactions has proven to be very difficult, relying on selective fractional crystallization 
methods, which give poor yields, inadequate separations, and often are not 
reproducible on a production scale. Pure polymethine dyes are needed in the color 
imaging art for true color reproduction. For example, when used in thermally 
bleachable antihalation layers of color imaging constructions, impure dyes cause 
undesirable color to remain after bleaching. The two well-known methods of synthesis of the pentamethine dye system 
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,939,117 and 4,948,715. U.S. Patent No. 
4,939,117 describes a method whereby 2 equivalents of a 1,1-diaryl-ethene are 
coupled with i-equivalent of triethylorthoformate in an
