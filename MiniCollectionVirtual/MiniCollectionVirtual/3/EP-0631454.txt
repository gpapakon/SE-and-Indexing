<ABSTRACT>
Following a call packet by means of which setting-up of a virtual connection within a first packet switching network (PVN1) is requested, an alternative connection including a second packet switching network (PVN2) is set up if no connecting path exists. Within the second packet switching network, the relevant call packet and signalling packets and data packets following the former, of the relevant virtual connection are transparently transferred in data packets of the alternative connection.

Method for setting up virtual connections
between calling and called subscriber devices (DTE11,

DTE21) which are connected to different switching
centres (Verm1, Verm2) in a first packet switching

network (PVN1), on the basis of address information
which designates the called subscriber devices that is

transmitted in the address fields of ringing packets,
in which case at least one first network gateway (UE1)

is provided from one of the switching centres (Verm1)
in the first packet switching network (PVN1) to a

second packet switching network (PVN2), and at least
one second network gateway (UE2) is provided from the

second packet switching network to a switching centre
(Verm2) in the first packet switching network, which

switching centre (Verm2) is different from the said one
switching centre,


in which case an address information item which
designates the respective second network gateway (UE2)

is stored in those switching centres (Verm1, Verm2) in

the first packet switching network which are provided
with a first network gateway,
in which case, when a ringing packet occurs on the
basis of which there is a desire to set up a virtual

connection within the first packet switching network
(PVN1) from a calling subscriber device (DTE11), a

routing search is first of all carried out, in the
switching centre (Verm1) that is provided with a first 

network gateway, for a connecting route within the
first packet switching network based on the address

information item contained in the address field of the
relevant ringing packet,
and in which case, if such a connecting route does not
exist within the first packet switching network (PVN1),

a substitute route is set up via the second packet
switching network (PVN2) including the respective first

and the respective second network gateway (UE1, UE2),
characterized
in that, in order to set up the substitute route, the
ringing packet which is currently occurring is

initially held at the respective first network gateway
(UE1), and a separate process of setting up a virtual

substitute connection is initiated first of all, for
this ringing packet, via this first network gateway, in

the second packet switching network for that switching
centre (Verm 2) which is connected to the respective

second network gateway (UE2), on the basis of a
signalling procedure which is defined for the second

packet switching network,
in that, after a connection has been set up, the
ringing packets which have initially been held at the

first network gateway (UE1) are inserted into at least
one data packet of this virtual substitute connection

and are transmitted in a transparent manner within the
second switching network between the respective first

and the respective second network gateway,
and in that, based on the ringing packet which is
transmitted in a transparent manner within the second

packet switching network, the currently desired virtual
connection between the respective calling subscriber

device and the subscriber device in question which is
being called in the first packet switching network

(PVN1) is set up taking account of the substitute route
running in the second packet switching network.
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized


in that the first packet switching network (PVN1) is
formed from a private packet switching network, while,

in contrast, the second packet switching network (PVN2)
is formed from a public packet switching network.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized

in that, once the virtual substitute connection has
been set up, data packets which are to be transmitted

between a calling subscriber device (DTE11) and a
called subscriber device (DTE21) are likewise inserted

into the data packets of the virtual substitute
connection, and are transmitted in a transparent manner

within the second packet switching network (PVN2).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized

in that, for the situation in which the ringing packet
which is defined for the first packet switching network

(PVN1) and/or the data packets transmitted in the first
packet switching network have a greater length than the

data packets which can be transmitted in the second
packet switching network (PVN2), the ringing packet

and/or the data packets are/is segmented, and the
segments are transmitted in a plurality of data

packets, in a transparent manner, within the second
packet switching network.
