<ABSTRACT>
The vacuum cleaner nozzle of the invention has a nozzle body (1) with a suction-pipe connection and a baseplate (2) which closes off the nozzle body at the bottom, the baseplate having at least one flow channel (3, 4) which is open at the bottom and leads into a central suction channel (5) connected to the suction-pipe connection, and sealing or closing-off elements which surround the flow channel at least in certain regions. The nozzle body and the baseplate are designed here as an integral carrier, into which the flow channel or the flow channels and the suction channel are directly moulded. The sealing or closing-off elements in the form of bristle strips (17, 18) and/or sealing lips (13, 14) are directly moulded and/or pressed, injected or adhesively bonded into the baseplate. By virtue of this design, the number of components of the vacuum cleaner nozzle is reduced substantially, thereby resulting in a significant simplification with regard to production and assembly.

A vacuum cleaner nozzle having a baseplate (2), two flow channels (3, 4), which are

disposed transversely to the direction of operation, are open towards the floor, and lead into
a suction channel (5), wherein the suction channel (5) is attached via a joint part (7) to a

suction tube connection piece, 
characterised in that
 the baseplate (2) is integrally formed
on the suction channel (5) and forms a one-piece nozzle body (1) therewith, wherein the flow

channels (3, 4) are formed in the baseplate (2) and wherein closure elements (13, 14) are
directly formed in and/or are pressed, injection moulded or adhesively bonded into the

baseplate (2) and protrude from the underside thereof, which closure elements extend on both
sides of the flow channels (3, 4) substantially over the entire width of the baseplate (2) and

transversely to the direction of operation.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 1, characterised in that the flow channels
(3, 4) run substantially parallel to the front and/or rear edge of the baseplate (2) and are open

outwards with respect to the longitudinal axis of the flow channels (3, 4).
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the flow
channels (3, 4) have a parabolic cross-section and are also of parabolic construction in

longitudinal section with respect to their longitudinal axis.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that running
rollers (11) are disposed in the flow channels (3, 4) in the region of the axially outer ends,

which running rollers substantially close the flow channels (3, 4) towards the axial ends.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to claim 4, characterised in that the running
rollers (11) are each mounted on two elastically deformable stub axles (12) which are

integrally formed on the baseplate (2). 
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
strip- or band-shaped thread lifters are disposed on the baseplate (2), directly in front of

and/or behind the mouth of the suction channel (2), which thread lifters are moulded into the
baseplate (2) or are adhesively bonded or pressed into indentations therein during the

manufacture of the nozzle body (1).
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the baseplate (2) has flat regions on its base, which adjoin the flow channels, which have a

slightly wedge-shaped profile and which form flow spoiler edges (19, 20) for the flow
channels (3, 4).
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that
the closure elements (13, 14) consist of a bristle border and/or of sealing lips made of an

elastomer material.
A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that
at least one rear runing roller (10) is disposed in the region of the end of the suction channel

(5) on the suction tube side.
