<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video system
for video telephones and video conferences using video
cameras and the like.In recent years, along with the development of
microprocessors which can realize high-speed arithmetic
operations, personal computers, workstations, and the
like for multimedia information can process a large
volume of image information and audio information in
real time. More specifically, personal computers and
workstations can realize a device for reading out a
full-color moving image signal, an audio signal, and
the like from a CD-ROM, and reproducing these signals
in association with each other, and a video conference
or video telephone function of mainly achieving a
conference such as a meeting by converting a moving
image signal and an audio signal from a video camera
into digital signals, and transmitting compressed
digital signals to a remote station via a communication
line.In the video telephone or video conference
function utilizing a personal computer or workstation,
a video camera is arranged on or near a monitor. 
Recently, a system which can control the video camera
in accordance with commands from the personal computer
or workstation by a simple operation has been developed.
Teleconference system using remote controlled cameras are known
from, for example, EP-A-0 523 617, US-A-4 516 156 or EP-A-0 400
668.However, when the video telephone or video
conference function is realized using a combination of
a personal computer or workstation with a video camera,
different device driver software programs must be
prepared and selectively used in correspondence with
the sensor sizes and functions of video cameras,
resulting in inconvenience for an operator. In order
to detect a photographing range in direction or zoom
control of the camera, the range must be confirmed by
operating the camera to the limit of the direction or
zoom control, and a cumbersome operation is required
for displaying a required image on a monitor, resulting
in poor operability. Furthermore, in the video
conference or video telephone function, since the
direction and zooming of the camera can be controlled
by the remote station side, an image including contents
which are not to be disclosed to a third party is
undesirably transmitted to the remote station, thus
posing a problem associated with protection of privacy.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a video system which can solve the 
above-mentioned problems, and is easy to use.It is another object of the present invention to
provide
