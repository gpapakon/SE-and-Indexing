<ABSTRACT>
The method comprises the following successive steps:   a) insertion of the lining (11) stretched between the male (4) and female (1) dies of an open pressure thermoforming mould, the mould cavities (2), (5) reproducing the shape of the article to be produced; b) preforming the lining (11) at least in the areas (3) which are highly deformed by forced application against at least part of one of the mould cavities (2) and holding this lining against the latter; c) inserting the preheated support sheet (13) between the cavities (2), (5) of the open mould; d) closing the mould in order to ensure association between the support sheet (13) and the preformed decorative lining (11) and the final moulding of the article to be produced.   The method and the mould are particularly suitable for the production of internal fittings (mountings) of motor-vehicle doors comprising, in particular, arm rests.
