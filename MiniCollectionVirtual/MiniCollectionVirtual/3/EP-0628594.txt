<CLAIMS>
Process for the manufacture of a bipolar
membrane, according to which a cationic membrane is

treated with a compound of a polyvalent metal and with an
aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution and is then

joined side by side to an anionic membrane, characterized
in that the alkali metal hydroxide comprises lithium

hydroxide.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cationic membrane is treated first with the

polyvalent metal compound and then with the aqueous
alkali metal hydroxide solution, the said solution being

substantially free of polyvalent metal compound.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the alkali metal hydroxide comprises at

least 90 mol % of lithium hydroxide.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the polyvalent metal comprises

chromium.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that, in order to treat the cationic

membrane with the polyvalent metal compound, it is
brought into contact with an aqueous solution of the said

compound.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the solution of the polyvalent metal compound is a

basic solution.
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the basic solution is an aqueous alkali metal

hydroxide solution having a pH value at least equal to
12.
Process according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that the aqueous solution of the polyvalent

metal compound comprises at least 0.1 mol per litre of
the said compound.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that, before joining the cationic

membrane and the anionic membrane side by side, the
anionic membrane is subjected to a treatment which 

consists essentially of a washing with demineralized
water.
Process for the manufacture of an aqueous
alkali metal hydroxide solution by electrodialysis of an

aqeuous alkali metal salt solution, characterized in that
electrodialysis is carried out in the presence of a

bipolar membrane obtained by means of a process in
accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 9.
