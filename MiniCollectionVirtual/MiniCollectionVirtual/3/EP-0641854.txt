<ABSTRACT>
A low sulfur diesel fuel which contains a di- and/or tri-C₁₋₁₀ alkyl ether of glycerol in 
amount sufficient to reduce particulate matter emissions. Methyl soyate and/or a cetane 

improver may also be included. Also provided is a novel mixture comprising a 
predominant amount of 1,3-di-t-alkyl glycerol and also comprising 1,2-di-t-alkyl 

glycerol and 1,2,3-tri-t-alkyl glycerol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved diesel fuel
which has reduced particulate matter emission characteristics and
which contains an effective amount of a dialkyl ether and/or
trialkyl ether derivative of glycerol and most preferably the
glycerol di-t-butyl ether product mixture prepared by glycerol
etherification with isobutylene or t-butanol.Diesel fuels are known which contain a synergistic cetane
improving additive combination of a peroxidic component and an
aliphatic polyether of the formula R(-O-X)nO-R1 where R and R1 are
alkyl groups, X is an alkylene group and n is an integer. See
U.S. Patent 2,655,440 and divisional U.S. Patent 2,763,537.European Application 80-100827.7 describes the use of
various propylene glycol mono- and di-ethers as a component of
diesel fuels. The compositions described in this reference
involve a multicomponent formulation which includes poly-ethers,
acetals, lower alkanols, water and only up to 85 volume % diesel
fuel hydrocarbons.U.K. 1,246,853 describes the addition of dialkyl ethers of
propylene glycol as smoke suppressants in diesel fuel.U.S. Patent 4,753,661 describes a fuel such as diesel fuel
containing a conditioner which comprises a polar oxygenated
hydrocarbon, a compatibilizing agent which is an alcohol, 
aromatics, and a hydrophilic separant which may be a glycol
monoether.Japanese Published Application 59-232176 describes the use
of the di-ethers of various polyoxyalkalene compounds as diesel
fuel additives.The addition of glycol ethers and metallic smoke
suppressants have been found to reduce the smoke and soot
emissions. These metallic smoke suppressants are typically metal
salts of alkanoic acids. Both the health and environmental risks
of these salts, especially those of barium, are of concern. See
U.S. 3,594,138, U.S. 3,594,140, U.S. 3,615,292 and U.S.
3,577,228.EP-A-0 077 027 describes the use of
ethers to reduce soot. However, a number of these ethers are
unable to be used commercially in the U.S. because the resulting
fuel does not meet the flash point specification of 126°F. This
application also teaches that glycol ethers are not highly
effective at reducing exhaust emissions. Based on these
teachings, our invention would be unexpected.Japanese Patent Application 59-232176 teaches that glycol
ethers of the formula R1-O-(CHR2-CH2-O-)nR3 where n is less than
five have the effect of reducing particulate, CO and HC emissions
which effect is weak. This is in direct contrast to our
invention.Winsor and Bennethum (SAE 912325) describe the use of
