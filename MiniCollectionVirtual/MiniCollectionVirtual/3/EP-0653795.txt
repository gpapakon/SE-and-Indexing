<ABSTRACT>
An NMOS transistor (10) has a source (14) and a drain (20) 
composed of n+ type of semiconductor material. A substrate 

region (16) composed of a p-type of semiconductor material is 
disposed between the source and the drain. A gate region (30) is 

disposed above the substrate region and between the source 
region and the drain region. A first implant region (32) is 

disposed adjacent to the source region and the gate region. The 
first implant region is composed of p type of semiconductor 

material with a first doping concentration. A second implant 
region (34) is disposed between the first implant region and the 

substrate. The second implant region is composed of p type of 
semiconductor material with a second doping concentration. The 

channel doping profile (36,38) first and second implant regions is 
tailored to obtain the optimum internal electric field to 

maximize device transconductance, while simultaneously 
controlling the device threshold voltage and punch through 

characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to MOS devices and, more
particularly, to a high gain MOS device with improved frequency response.MOS devices are commonly used in radio frequency applications such as
cellular phones and other communications products. For radio frequency
applications it is desirable to obtain higher power gain and improved frequency
response than can be obtained in prior art MOS devices.In MOS devices higher power gain is typically obtained by increasing the
transconductance (Gm) of the MOS device. Techniques to improve
transconductance generally require advancements in processing technologies,
e.g. advances in photolithographic techniques, or advances in thin insulator
growth techniques. The increase in Gm is usually accomplished by using a
single channel doping implant. The increase in Gm is related to the increase in
the internal electric field near the source of the implanted channel. However, in
a single channel implant, there is a limit to which this internal electric field may
be increased before short channel effect and drain induced barrier lowering
occurs.A prior art MOS device according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol.
17, no. 649 and Japanese Patent Application No. JP-A-5 211 328. This
reference describes an MOS device having a source region formed from N-type
semiconductor material, a P-type implant region formed below the source
region and extending into the channel region, and a P-type implant region
formed between the source region and a drain region.Hence, a need exists for an improved MOS device for higher power gain
and improved radio frequency response while reducing short channel effect and
drain induced barrier lowering. FIG. 1 illustrates a MOS transistor layout; andFIG. 2 is a plot useful in the explanation of the invention.Generally, the present invention relates to an NMOS 
transistor design with improved DC gain and transconductance.
First and second implant regions with different doping
concentrations are disposed adjacent to the source region and
gate region for tailoring the profile of the lateral channel region.
The first and second implant regions also act as source
protection from punch through electric fields. By using the
implants, the channel doping profile is tailored to obtain the
optimum internal electric field to maximize device
transconductance, while simultaneously controlling the device
threshold voltage and punch through characteristics.FIG. 1 illustrates an NMOS field effect transistor 10
