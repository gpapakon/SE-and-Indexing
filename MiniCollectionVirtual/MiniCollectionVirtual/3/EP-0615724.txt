<ABSTRACT>
A surgical suturing clamp is provided with two clamping jaws (3, 4) which can be moved relative to one another in a forceps-like manner. It is designed as a suturing clamp which can be used with an endoscope, can be inserted through a trocar into the interior of the body and has an insertion pipe (1). In the region of the latter's inner pipe end (2) which can be inserted in the interior of the body at least one clamping jaw (3) is mounted so as to be actuated pivotably relative to the second clamping jaw (4). In the region of the outer pipe end (15) remaining outside the body there is arranged a drive (spindle wheel 22) which is coupled via a gear (threaded bolt 31, connecting rod 34) to the at least one, pivotably driven clamping jaw (3).

A surgical suture clamp, in particular a purse string suture clamp for applying
a purse string suture during the performance of gastric, intestinal and

pulmonary operations or the like, with two clamp jaws (3, 4) movably positioned
one in relation to the other in a forceps-like manner, the suture

clamp being structured as an endoscopable suture clamp, to be led into the
body via a trocar, with a leading-in tube (1), in the vicinity of the inner tube

end (2) of which, to be led into the body, at least one clamp jaw (3) is positioned
to be pivotably driven in relation to the second clamp jaw (4), and

a drive (22) being arranged in the vicinity of the outer tube end (15) remaining
outside the body and is coupled, by way of a transmission (31,

34), with the at least one pivotably driven clamp jaw (3, 4) for the opening
and the closing of the suture clamp, 
characterized in that
 in the closed
condition, the clamp jaws (3, 4) in their longitudinal direction (L) extend at

a small acute angle (W) to the longitudinal axis of the leading-in tube (1),
and the angle being dimensioned such that the clamp jaws (3, 4), in their

closed position, remain within the contour of the leading-in tube.
A suture clamp according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the drive and
the transmission are formed as a spindle drive with a spindle wheel (22)

arrested longitudinally axially in relation to the tube axis (A) and positioned
coaxially rotatably thereto and a push bar (34, 31) arrested in the

direction of rotation and longitudinally axially displaceable in the leading-in
tube (1), which push bar (34, 31), with an external thread (32) at its

outer end, is in engagement with an internal thread (30) of the spindle
wheel (22) and which, with its inner end (35), is coupled for articulation

with the at least one pivotably positioned clamp jaw (3, 4). 
A suture clamp according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the clamp
jaws (3, 4) are each formed as an arm of double-armed clamp levers (5, 6),

which are positioned at the inner tube end (2) pivotably about an axis (10)
and of which the operating aims (39, 40) are connected by way of articulated

lever bars (36, 37) for articulation with the inner end (35) of the push
bar (34).
A suture clamp according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a forked
bearing head (9) is provided at the inner tube end (2), between the fork legs

(7, 8) of which forked bearing head (9) the clamp levers (5, 6) are positioned
pivotably about a common axis (10).
A suture clamp according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 at least with
the clamp jaws (3, 4) closed, the inner end (35) of the push bar (34) and the

articulated lever bars (36, 37) are arranged between the fork legs (7, 8) of
the forked bearing head (9).
A suture clamp according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that

a substantially cylindrical handle member (16) is arranged at the outer tube
end (15).
A suture clamp according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the spindle
wheel (22) is pivotably supported on the handle member (16) and is longitudinally

axially arrested by means of projections (26) on the spindle wheel
(22) engaging with an annular circumferential groove on the handle member

(16). 
A suture clamp according to one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that

for arrest of rotation, the push bar (34, 31) is provided with a radially projecting
elevation (43), which engages with an oblong hole (44) extending

parallel to the longitudinal axis (A) of the leading-in tube (1).
