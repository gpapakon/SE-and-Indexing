<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous composition for coating onto a substrate to form 
a wall covering comprises a 

copolymer of a diene and a copolymerisable ester such 
as methyl methacrylate. The composition includes 

filler, pigment and optionally blowing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wall coverings.It is known to produce wallpaper and like
materials by coating a substrate with a synthetic latex
composition based on, for example, acrylic materials or
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers usually in
combination with a filler in an amount of from, for
example, 500 to 900 parts by weight of dry copolymer.
Such compositions have good UV resistance, good
printability and a degree of sponge resistance, but
they will not withstand scrubbing and they have little
dry abrasion resistance. The coating cannot normally
be peeled as a sheet from the substrate (which is a
disadvantage when ultimately stripping the wall
covering from the wall) and the coated substrate has
poor resistance to wear and soiling by, for example,
household products such as ketchup and mustard.
Generally, the compositions are applied in an amount of
from 15 to 25 gsm or up to 40 gsm if an improved degree
of spongeability is required or if the surface is to be
embossed.To some extent, the aforementioned disadvantages
can be overcome by using coating compositions
comprising a plastisol which is a colloidal dispersion
of vinyl chloride polymer in a plasticiser. The vinyl
plastisol is applied to a substrate of paper
to form a coating and the coating is then
subjected to elevated temperature to gel it. The
composition may be applied as a uniform coating or in
patterned form and may include a filler and/or pigment.
In the case where a structured coating is to be
produced, a blowing agent is included in the
composition to cause the composition to expand as the
coating is gelled. These plastisol-based coatings offer much improved
scrub resistance and are more durable than conventional
latex-based coatings. Also PVC plastisol-based
coatings can be peeled as a sheet from the backing
paper on stripping and they have improved hanging
properties due to improved wet tear resistance.
Further, the plastisol-coated coating materials have
improved dimensional stability and good stain and soil
resistance. However, PVC plastisol coatings are not
light or heat stable, and suffer colour degradation.
Also PVC plastisols can be difficult to process in that
a controlled and uniform surface gloss is difficult to
maintain. Further, the high temperatures required in
the processing of PVC plastisols require specialised
high temperature equipment and the spirit solvents,
normally found necessary to the processability of PVC
plastisols, need to be extracted and disposed of by
regulated methods. In addition, the accidental burning
