<ABSTRACT>
A medical pressure-sensitive adhesive and a medical 
bandage formed using the same are disclosed. The medical 

pressure-sensitive adhesive comprises an acrylic polymer and a 
specific liquid or pasty component which is in a liquid state 

or pasty state at room temparature and is compatible with the 
acrylic polymer. The medical pressure-sensitive adhesive is 

suitable for use as a plaster, a pressure-sensitive dressing, 
a poultice and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical pressure-sensitive
adhesive which is suitably used for a plaster, a
pressure-sensitive dressing, a poultice, etc., and to a medical
bandage formed using the pressure-sensitive adhesive.Hitherto, various kinds of medical pressure-sensitive
adhesives have been used for medical bandages.As the result of attaching importance to the adhesion
to the skin in conventional medical pressure-sensitive
adhesives, the countermeasures to the skin stimulation has
been insufficient.Recently, since percutaneous absorption-type preparations
prepared by incorporating a drug or drugs in pressure-sensitive
adhesives are increased and the adhering time is
prolonged, the countermeasures to the skin stimulation become
necessary, and many medical pressure-sensitive adhesives
prepared by compounding a polymer with a large amount of a
liquid or pasty component having a good compatibility with the
polymer and giving very slight damage to a stratum corneum have
been proposed as one of such countermeasures.However, some of these medical pressure-sensitive
adhesives are used for the skin only as adhesives containing
drugs and others are applied in various states for various 
medical fittings and medical instruments, such as a means for
fixing catheters, etc.For some of such medical fittings and medical
instruments, a material into which a plasticizer is easily
transferred, such as non-plasticized polyvinyl chloride, is
used and when a medical pressure-sensitive adhesive containing
a liquid or pasty component is applied to such a medical
fitting or medical instrument, the liquid or pasty component is
easily transferred into the medical fitting or the medical
instrument to cause a possibility of damaging the medical
fitting or the medical instrument.Further, when a medical bandage is prepared by forming
the layer of the pressure-sensitive adhesive on a support, the
liquid or pasty component is transferred into the support to
change the composition of the medical pressure-sensitive adhesive.
Thus, in spite of the disadvantage that it is necessary
to use a support into which such a liquid or pasty component of
the medical pressure-sensitive adhesive is not transferred,
which results in greatly restricting the selective range of the
support, any investigation has not been made at present from
this point on the medical pressure-sensitive adhesive
compounded with a large amount of a liquid or pasty component. EP-A-531938 describes the use of ethyl oleate
as plasticizer in polyacrylic

<CLAIMS>
A medical pressure-sensitive adhesive comprising 100 parts by weight of an
acrylic polymer and from 30 to 100 parts by weight of a liquid or pasty component

which is in a liquid state or a pasty state at room temperature and is compatible
with the acrylic polymer, wherein the liquid or pasty component comprises at least

one ester selected from the group consisting of an ester of a monobasic acid or a
polybasic acid each having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and a branched alcohol

having from 14 to 18 carbon atoms and an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid or a
branched acid each having from 14 to 18 carbon atoms and a tetrahydric or lower

hydric alcohol, and from 40 to 80% by weight of the acrylic polymer is insolubilized
by crosslinking, with the proviso that medical pressure-sensitive adhesives

containing ethyl oleate are excluded.
The medical pressure-sensitive adhesive as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
acrylic polymer is a homopolymer of a (meth)acrylic acid ester or a copolymer of

the (meth)acrylic acid ester and a monomer copolymerizable herewith.
The medical pressure-sensitive adhesive as claimed in claim 2, wherein said
(meth)acrylic acid ester has 2 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety.
The medical pressure-sensitive adhesive as claimed in claim 2, wherein said
monomer is at least one member selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl

group-containing monomer, a sulfoxyl group-containing monomer, a hydroxyl
group-containing monomer, an amido group-containing monomer, an

alkylaminoalkyl group-containing monomer, a (meth)acrylic acid alkoxyalkyl ester,
an alkoxy group (or ether bond at the side chain)-containing (meth)acrylic ester,

and a vinyl monomer. 
The medical pressure-sensitive adhesive as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
amount of the liquid or pasty component is from 30 to 80 parts by weight per 100

parts by weight of the acrylic polymer.
The medical pressure-sensitive adhesive as claimed in claim 1, wherein said ester
of the monobasic acid or the polybasic acid and the branched alcohol is at least

one member selected from the group consisting of isosteraryl laurate, isocetyl
