<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support for
planographic printing plate and more particularly to a
process for the preparation of an aluminum support which can
be well subjected to surface treatment such as electrolytic
graining and anodizing and which exhibits small strength drop
even when subjected to burning.As an aluminum support for printing plate,
particularly for offset printing plate, there is used an
aluminum plate (including aluminum alloy plate).In general, an aluminum plate to be used as a support
for offset printing plate needs to have a proper adhesion to
a photographic light-sensitive material and a proper water
retention.The surface of the aluminum plate should be uniformly
and finely grained to meet the aforesaid requirements. This
graining process large affects a printing performance and a
durability of the printing plate upon the printing process
following manufacture of the plate. Thus, it is important
for the manufacture of the plate whether such graining is
satisfactory or not. In general, an alternating current electrolytic
graining method is used as the method of graining an aluminum
support for a printing plate. There are a variety of
suitable alternating currents, for example, a sinewaveform, a
squarewaveform, a special alternating waveform and the like.
When the aluminum support is grained by alternating current
supplied between the aluminum plate and an opposite electrode
such as a graphite electrode, this graining is usually
conducted only one time, as the result of which, the depth of
pits formed by the graining is small over the whole surface
thereof. Also, the durability of the-grained printing plate
during printing will deteriorate. Therefore, in order to
obtain a uniformly and closely grained aluminum plate
satisfying the requirement of a printing plate with deep pits
as compared with their diameters, a variety of methods have
been proposed as follows.One method is a graining method to use a current of
particular waveform for an electrolytic source (JP-A-53-67507)
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application".) Another method is
to control a ratio between an electricity quantity of a
positive period and that of a negative period at the time of
alternating electrolytic graining (JP-A-54-65607). Still
another method is to control the waveform supplied from
electrolytic source (JP-A-55-25381). Finally, another method 
is directed to a combination of current density (JP-A-56-29699).Further, known is a graining method using a
