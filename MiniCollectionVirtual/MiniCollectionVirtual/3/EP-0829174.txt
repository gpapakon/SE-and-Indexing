<ABSTRACT>
A subscriber station for the wireless connection of user telecommunications equipment to a remote central station of a wireless telecommunications system includes a transmitter/receiver for wireless communication with the central station, at least one telephone line for connection to subscriber telecommunications equipment and a communications controller connected between the transmitter/receiver and the telephone line for processing signals for transmission and/or received signals. The subscriber station is configurable in response to wireless programming signals representative of control code down-loaded from the central station. By enabling the down-loading of software for programming the subscriber station, the flexibility and convenience of configuring the subscriber station, both initially and subsequently, is greatly enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RECONFIGURABLE SUBSCRIBER TERMINAL FOR A WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMThe present invention relates in general to telecommunications systems and more particularly to the configuring of a subscriber terminal of a wireless telecommunications system.A wireless telecommunications system has been proposed with a central terminal, or station, at a central location in wireless communication with a plurality of subscriber terminals, or stations, at subscriber locations to implement a wireless telephony system. The system is intended to be used with fixed subscriber locations rather than the more familiar mobile cellular telephone systems.The system finds a wide variety of possible applications, for example in rural, remote, or sparsely populated areas where the cost of laying permanent wire or optical networks would be too expensive, in heavily built-up areas where conventional wired systems are at full capacity or the cost of laying such systems would involve too much interruption to the existing infrastructure or be too expensive, and so on.In the proposed system, the subscriber terminal is required to perform wireless transmission and reception tasks, signal coding and decoding tasks, initialisation and authentication tasks as well conventional telephony tasks. Functions for executing these tasks can be set up at the initial installation of the subscriber unit at a customer's location. However, it may be desired to update the functions available at the customer's premises after installation. Particularly bearing in mind that the subscriber stations may be widely scattered, it is inconvenient to have to visit each subscriber station in order to provide for re-programming of the subscriber station. It may be desirable in some instances to ensure that standard installation is effected for all subscriber stations. In other instances, it may be desirable to provide different installations at different subscriber stations. The administration in ensuring that installers have the correct equipment at subscriber stations is significant. Accordingly, it can be seen that the programming and installation of subscriber stations is a potentially costly and inconvenient operation. The invention seeks to address these problems. 

 In accordance with the invention, therefore, there is provided a subscriber station for the wireless connection of user telecommunications equipment to a remote central station of a wireless telecommunications system, the subscriber station comprising a transmitter/receiver for wireless

 CLAIMS
1. A subscriber station for the wireless connection of user telecommumcations equipment to a remote central station of a wireless telecommunications system, said subscriber station comprising a transmitter/receiver for wireless communication with said central station, at least one telephone line for connection to subscriber telecommunications equipment and a communications controller connected between said transmitter/receiver and said telephone line for processing signals for transmission and/ or received signals, said subscriber station being configurable in response to wireless programming signals representative of control code down-loaded from said central station.
2. A subscriber station according to Claim 1, wherein said communications controller comprises one or more memories loadable with control code down-loaded from said central station and a processor arranged to execute said control code for configuring said subscriber station.
3. A subscriber station according to Claim 2, comprising two memories for storing control code, wherein said communications controller is arranged to store successive updates of control code received from said central station alternately in said control memories, each update has an associated version number and said processor is arranged to execute said control code having the most recent valid version number.
4. A subscriber station according to Claim 3, comprising a reset state machine, said processor responding to a reset state of said reset state machine to determine which memory contains the control code having the most recent valid version number.
5. A subscriber station according to Claim 4, wherein each said memory is a flash memory. 


6. A subscriber station according to any one of Claims 2 to 5, wherein said processor is a microcontroller.
7. A subscriber station according to any one of Claims 2 to 6, wherein said communications controller comprises a digital signal processor and/or a programmable storage unit, said processor configures said digital signal processor and/or said programmable storage unit with said control code.
8. A subscriber station according to any preceding Claim, wherein said transmitter/receiver comprises at least one aerial and is contained with said communications controller in a common housing to be mounted on a strucmre to permit wireless communication between said subscriber station and said remote central station.
9. A subscriber station according to Claim 8, comprising a drop cable to a power supply unit and for connection of said user telecommunication equipment.
10. A wireless telecommunications system comprising at least one said subscriber station according to any preceding Claim and a central station, said central station being arranged to transmit programming information to said subscriber station for configuring said subscriber station.
.11. A method of programming a subscriber station for wireless connection of telecommunications equipment to a remote central station of a wireless telecommunications system, the method comprising: transmitting wireless programming signals representative of control code from said central station to said subscriber station; receiving said programming signals at said subscriber station; and configuring said subscriber station in response to said control code represented by said programming signals down-loaded from said central station. 


12. A method according to Claim 11, comprising: storing said control code down-loaded from said central station; executing said control code by means of a processor in said subscriber station for configuring said subscriber station.
13. A method according to Claim 12, wherein successive updates of control code received from said central station are alternately stored in a respective one of two memories, each update having an associated version number, said processor executing said control code having the most recent valid version number.
14. A method according to Claim 13, wherein said processor responds to a reset state of a state machine to determine which memory contains the control code having the most recent valid version number.
15. A method according to Claim 14, wherein each said memory is a flash memory.
16. A method according to any one of Claims 12 to 15, wherein said processor is a microcontroller.
17. A method according to any one of Claims 12 to 16, wherein said processor configures a digital signal processor and/or a programmable storage unit in said subscriber station with said control code.
