<ABSTRACT>
Described is a pressure filter with a liquid space having a liquid feed inlet and at least one filter surface with a mutiplicity of apertures, one side of the filter surface being bounded by the liquid space while the other side is bounded by a filtrate space with a filtrate discharge outlet, the filter also having a back-flushing device. The back-flushing device has a head which passes over the filter surface and seals off part of the filter surface with respect to the liquid space. The back-flushing head delimits a back-flushing space with at least one suction chamber which presents a slit-like opening towards the filter surface and to which a reject line is connected. The strip-like or plate-like back-flushing head is associated with an elastic pressure device which presses the radially outer zone of the back-flushing head axially on to the filter surface, thus ensuring radially uniform contact pressure of the back-flushing head on the surface of the filter.

A pressure filter comprising a fluid compartment (21)
having a fluid inlet (18), at least one filter surface

in the fluid compartment (21), said filter surface
having a plurality of apertures, one side of said

filter surface being restricted by the fluid
compartment (21) and the other side of said filter

surface being restricted by a filtrate compartment
having a filtrate outlet (19), and a backwashing unit

comprising a slat-like or plate-like washing head
sweeping over the filter surface and sealing a part of

the filter surface with respect to the fluid
compartment, said backwashing head restricting a

backwashing compartment having at least one suction
chamber open to the filter surface in a slot-like

manner, said backwashing compartment having connected
thereto a reject drain (25), and a resiliently acting

pressure means pressing the backwashing head axially
towards the filter surface, characterized in that the

pressure means is formed by at least one biassed
spring strut (6) which extends in a radially inclined

manner and is supported centrally at the backwashing
head and at the radial end portion thereof, said

spring strut (6) resiliently pressing the radial outer
edge of the backwashing head (5) towards the filter 

surface and the biassing force of which being
adjustable.
The pressure filter according to claim 1,
characterized in that the part of the backwashing head

contacting the filter surface is resiliently
supported.
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the spring strut (6) is

supported radially inside in a part-spherical bearing
socket (45) by means of a part-spherical stud (44).
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the spring strut (6)

includes a rod (40) engaging into a cylinder (43)
containing at least one spring (48) and on which a

pressure is applied by the spring (48).
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least one hollow slat

sweeping over the filter surface is disposed at a
carrier plate (5) for the backwashing head, said

hollow slat including the slot-like aperture (30).
The pressure filter according to claim 5,
characterized in that at least one bracket (37) is

disposed at the radial outer edge of the carrier plate
(5), the spring strut (6) being tensioned against the

bracket (37).
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the slat-like or plate-like

backwashing head has a bearing at its radial end
portion which slides or rolls on the filter element 

having the filter surface.
The pressure filter according to claim 7,
characterized in that the bearing includes at least

one roller (50) rolling on a raised ring (54) of the
filter element.
The pressure filter according to claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that the pressure of the roller (50)

against the filter element is adjustable.
The pressure filter according to one of the claims 2
to 9, characterized in that the resilient support of

the part of the backwashing head contacting the filter
surface is formed by a resiliently supported plate

(31) at the lower side of the part of the backwashing
head.
The pressure filter according to claim 10,
characterized in that the plate (31) is supported by a

silicon bearing (32).
The pressure filter according to claim 11,
characterized in that the silicon bearing (32) is

formed by sheathed silicon gel cushions.
The pressure filter according to one of the claims 10
to 12, characterized in that the plate (31) is guided

on both sides.
