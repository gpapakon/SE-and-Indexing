<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a waveguide amplifier with an input for optical signals
and an output for optical signals with at least one piece of amplifying waveguide
with at least one mean (4) for coupling pump laser modules to the amplifying
waveguide which contains Tm ions. The invention is also related to a pumping
scheme for waveguide amplifier feeding two different wavelengths in to the
waveguide .A number of waveguide amplifiers especially fiber amplifiers for amplifying signals
in an optical transmission network are well established or under investigation. There
is a category using the principle of doping glass fibers with rare earth ions such as
praseodymium (PR3+), neodymium (Nd3+), erbium (ER3+) thulium (Tm3+), ytterbium
(Yb3+)

In this rare earth doped fiber amplifiers the glass is a passive host and the medium
polarization responsible for the field interaction is generated by the doping ions. As
the rare earth concentration can be made large, up to 10 weight % the fiber lengths
can be relatively short. Signal amplification is due to stimulated emission
accompanied by relaxation of the excited ion to the ground state. In this type of
amplifiers the pump and the signals bands are fixed by the rare earth atomic
resonances. Therefore the amplifiers have a gain spectrum with fixed center
wavelength several discrete pump bands. The rare earth doped amplifiers the gain
spectrum can be modified by the co dopants in the matrix. The glass host also 
affects the Stark level positions, transition homogeneous and inhomogeneous line
widths and the non-radiative decay characteristics.For example, US 5,973,824 is known, which describes the production and use of an
amplifying fiber composed of a glass composition of germanium, arsenic, selenium
and sulfur. It is also known to use other non-oxidic types of glass as material for
amplifying fibers. In particular, the use of materials consisting of halides and
sulfides doped with rare earths, as amplifying fibers seems promising. Compared
to silica glass, halide- and in particular fluoride glass has transparent properties,
which extend spectrally substantially further into the long-wave range. This is due to
the spectral shift of the multi-phonon absorption edge as a result of the
incorporation of substantially heavier ions. However, these types of glass present
technological difficulties in respect of material production and fiber preparation.
Their unfavorable mechanical properties and unfavorable behavior in humid
atmospheres have so far prevented their
