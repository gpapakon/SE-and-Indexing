<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to handpiece for use in microsurgery 
having a flexible and steerable 
aspiration tip. The flexible and steerable aspiration 
tip includes a flexible tip portion, the shape of which may be remotely 
altered to permit the tip portion to access difficult to reach areas 
while performing a variety of surgical procedures. The flexible and 
steerable aspiration tip is especially adapted for microsurgical 
procedures in the field of surgery, such as ophthalmic surgery including 
cataract extraction and neuro- or ear surgery. In the prior art, numerous devices having angled or movable 
portions have been proposed to facilitate device manipulation in various 
medical procedures. US-A-4,169,984 to Parisi 
discloses an ultrasonic probe assembly for use in surgical procedures. 
The ultrasonic probe includes an angled tip portion as best seen in 
Figure 2. However, the tip of Parisi does not include structure to 
permit movement thereof during surgical procedures. US-A-4,210,146 to Banko discloses a 
surgical instrument with a bendable blade. The blade is designed to 
move with respect to an opening in the instrument tip to make a shearing 
action to cut tissue which enters the opening. The blade is formed in a 
manner so that, as it reciprocates into a tapered portion of the distal 
end tube, it will bend to conform to the shape of the tapered portion of 
the tube to provide continuous contact and improve cutting action. The 
surgical instrument of Banko does not teach or suggest a flexible tip, 
the shape of which may be remotely altered to access different surgical 
sites. US-A-4,459,509 to Auth discloses a 
rotating cutting tool having spirally shaped cutting flutes with 
different cutting properties. The tool is driven from outside the tool 
body by means of a flexible drive shaft. The tool of Auth is designed 
to be inserted into a human vascular network to remove plaque deposits. US-A-4,473,077 to Noiles et al. discloses 
a surgical stapler apparatus having a flexible shaft. The apparatus 
includes structure which greatly reduces or essentially eliminates the  
 
tendency of the shaft assembly to revert to its straight condition 
during transmittal of longitudinal forces during stapling. US-A-4,672,964 to Dee et al. discloses a 
scalpel having a universally adjustable blade mounted to the scalpel 
handle for selective positioning. The scalpel includes structure which 
permits rotation of the blade about the axis of the handle as well as 
angular positioning with respect

An irrigation and aspiration handpiece for microsurgery, 
comprising a housing (31, 201), a cap (47, 47') that is received on and 

attached to a distal end of the housing, having a 
sleeve portion (53, 223) extending integrally therefrom with an open 

end and a longitudinal bore, an aspiration tip (1, 1') that is linked to 
a member (37, 215) in the housing and which tip extends along the 

longitudinal bore of the sleeve (53, 223), drive means (57, 210) 
to translate the member (37, 215) and the tip (1, 1') to position the tip (1, 1') 

within the sleeve and extending from the sleeve,  
 

an irrigation fluid flow 
passage (73, 73') coaxially located between the aspiration tip (10, 10') 

and the sleeve (53, 223), 
characterized by
 a straight rigid portion and a curved, flexible 
free end (3, 3') to the aspiration tip (10, 10'), the drive means being pneumatically - 

or electrically - driven, wherein, by translating the tip, the drive means 
remotely flex and position 

the free end of the tip between a stressed, straightened position 
within the sleeve (53, 223) and a relaxed, curved position extending 

from the sleeve. 
A handpiece according to claim 1, wherein the free end (3, 3') of 
the aspiration tip (10, 10') comprises a spring (5, 5'), curved in its 

relaxed state, coated by an elastomeric material. 
A handpiece according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the said 
means (57, 210) comprises a piston, bellows or diaphragm in combination 

with a source of pneumatic pressure. 
A handpiece according to claims 1 or 2 or 3, wherein the sleeve is rigid. 
A handpiece according to claim 3, 
wherein a pull wire (90) is attached 

between the piston and the free end (3') of the aspiration tip (10'), 
the sleeve being a soft, elastomeric sleeve. 
An irrigation and aspiration handpiece for microsurgery, 
comprising a housing (201), a cap (47') that is received on and 

attached to a distal end of the housing an aspiration tip (1') that is 
received on a member (205) in the housing characterized in that the tip extends from 

the cap, the aspiration tip has a straight rigid portion and a curved, flexible 
free end (3'), a pull wire (90) is attached to a distal end of the free end and a piston  

 
(210') is attached to the pull wire opposite the free end, the piston being 

adapted to reciprocate within a chamber (207) in the housing in 
response to pneumatic pressure to remotely flex and position the free 

end of the tip between a stressed, straightened position and a relaxed, 
curved position.
