<ABSTRACT>
Rail support device for unballasted railway track comprising at least one concrete block (12, 13) resting on a flexible base (10), the assembly being held in an elastomeric shell (15) which is anchored in a bed of mortar (B) covering the lower part of said block, and which has a beading (18) around its top edge. The horizontal cross section of said block is variable and has a maximum area at the level immediately below the beading on the upper edge of the shell (15) so as to limit the relative movement of the block (12, 13) and the shell (15) by means of an elastic force.

<CLAIMS>
Device for supporting a railway rail on a track without ballast, 
comprising at least one concrete block (12) resting on a supple sole (10); 

the assembly being maintained in a shell (15) made of elastomer material 
anchored in a bed of mortar (B) which envelops the lower part of said block 

and of which the upper edge is provided with a bead (18), characterized in 
that the horizontal section of said block is variable and presents a maximum 

surface at a level located immediately beneath the bead of the upper edge 
of the envelope (15) so as to limit the relative displacement of the block (12) 

and of the envelope (15) by elastic retention. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the horizontal 
section of said block is variable by modifying its width. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
thickness of the bead (18) is variable along the upper edge of said envelope 

(15). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the inner lateral walls of the envelope (15) are provided with 

horizontal grooves (7) adapted to cooperate with corresponding grooves 
made on the lateral face of the lower part of said block. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that said bead further comprises a member (19) for clamping on the 

upper part of said block. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the outer lateral walls of said envelope are provided with peripheral 

projections (15a) to reinforce anchoring in the bed of mortar.
