<ABSTRACT>
A direct acting hydraulic tappet (20) including a one piece 
body shell (30) having an outer cylinder (31), an inner cylinder (32) and a 

plurality of integral axially extending webs (33) that connect the 
outer cylinder (31) and the inner cylinder (32). A cam face member (41) is 

attached to one end of the body. An oil hole (40) extends from the 
outer surface of the outer cylinder (31) through one of the webs (33) to 

an inner surface of the inner cylinder (32). The hydraulic lash 
compensating unit (39) is positioned in the inner cylinder (32). The 

body shell (30) is made from an extruded length of aluminum and is 
preferably coated with a Teflon impregnated anodized coating. 

The cam face (41) is made of steel, cast iron or ceramic and is 
attached to the one end of the body shell by electromagnetic 

deformation or by the use of adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to direct acting hydraulic 
tappets. Existing direct acting tappets consist of an outer 
cylinder which is held in a bore in the cylinder head. It is 
contacted on one end by the camshaft and on the other by the 
valve. It is allowed to slide axially within the bore, 
translating the rotary motion of the camshaft into axial motion 
to the valve. The inside of this outer cylinder is large enough 
in diameter to surround the engine valve spring. They also contain an inner cylinder which holds a 
miniature hydraulic lash compensating element. These two 
cylinders are connected using a radial cross member which is 
roughly perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. This cross 
member effectively closes off the area between the two cylinders 
on either end. This can be done using one or two pieces, and 
is normally done using a low cost material. A wear resistant cap is then affixed to the end of 
the part facing the camshaft. In some applications the camface 
is integral with the outer cylinder and the perpendicular cross 
member is integral with the inner cylinder and is attached to 
the outer cylinder. In other designs the inner and outer 
cylinders are integral with an attached camface cap. In other  
 
designs the cylinder extends past the perpendicular cross member 
and captures the cap which is supported on the cross member. The joining methods for such tappets include welding, 
brazing, and staking (mechanical deformation). Because of the 
difficulty in joining steel to aluminum, proposed aluminum 
designs for this shell have been of the type using a perpendicular 
cross member which extends between the lash adjuster and the 
camface. The camface is simply held in place by the outer 
cylinder and the valve spring preload. Engine oil is supplied to the hydraulic lash 
compensating unit through a cavity or reservoir between the 
outer and inner cylinders. This cavity is bounded by the camface 
on one end and by the perpendicular cross member on the other. 
This cavity is filled from a hole in the outer cylinder which is 
in contact with pressurized engine oil. The outer cylinder is 
either coated or heat treated to prevent wear from contact with 
bore in cylinder head. In such tappets a major disadvantage is that the body 
of the tappet must be machined or cast in order to provide the 
perpendicular portion. Other disadvantages of the hydraulic 
tappets is that they are heavy, costly to manufacture, have 
multiple pieces, and are noisy in operation. In DE-A-2,942,926 there is
