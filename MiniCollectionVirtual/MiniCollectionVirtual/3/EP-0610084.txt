<ABSTRACT>
The invention appreciates that a stereoscopic image 
can be considered to be a series of slices and that if the 

slice data can be identified, then software, such as that 
which already exists, can be used to build a 2½D model.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the visual presentation of
information derived from a stereoscopic (3D) image system.In normal circumstances this information would be
viewed using any one of the well known techniques for
stereoscopic viewing. Many of these are particularly suited
for use with video type display monitors.Alternative displays known as 2½D representations
have found use in computer graphic and computer aided design
situations. These 2⅛D representations (referred to as 3D by
the computer graphics fraternity) are in fact a two
dimensional representation and contain only psychological
cues to depth such as linear perspective, interposition,
shading and shadowing, rather than the powerful physiological
depth cue known as binocular parallax or stereoscopy, i.e. a
true 3D image.Using these 2½D representations it is possible to
manipulate the image information in a number of ways which
provide alternative views of the same object. Examples are
image rotation and layer removal. These display techniques
have proved particularly beneficial for the viewing of images
derived from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
(MR) scanners which are now widely used by the medical
profession. Both of these types of scanners produce
information in a slice by slice format and a great deal of
software has already been developed to convert this multiple
slice information into the 2½D representation.Stereoscopic pairs of images can be obtained in a
variety of ways. They are effectively left and right two 
dimensional perspectives of a scene or object which are
analogous to the two perspectives seen by the eyes of a human
observer. The images may be displayed as photographs,
radiographs, video pictures and so on.The fundamental element of a stereoscopic pair of
images is that in general the image point of an object in say
the left perspective will have a corresponding or conjugate
point in the right perspective. The parallax which exists
between the same image point in each perspective is a measure
of the Z-coordinate, i.e. depth, of that point.
Consequently, there will be a number of resolvable depth
planes or slices in a stereoscopic display which are
separated by an amount which is related to the minimum
detectable parallax in the display. For example, in a
stereoscopic video display the minimum resolvable parallax
will be defined by the pixel resolution in the system, which
in turn defines the density of depth planes in the display.
This minimum detectable parallax will depend upon the
parameters of a

A method of creating a two dimensional solid model
representation of an object with psychological cues to depth,

known as a 2½D solid model representation, for viewing, in
which a stereoscopic image derived from a stereoscopic pair

of X-ray images of the object is resolved into a series of
depth slices by selecting for each depth slice conjugate

points of the pair at that depth, and the resulting depth
slice data is used to build up a 2½D solid model

representation using software which transforms the depth slice data.
A method of creating a two dimensional solid model
representation of an object with psychological cues to depth,

known as a 2½D solid model representation for viewing,
comprising:


a) comparing a stereoscopic pair of X-ray
images of the object at one relative lateral

position of the pair and identifying points of
coincidence to represent a slice through the

object at a depth corresponding to that
particular relative lateral position;
b) moving the pair laterally relative to one
another by an amount equal to the minimum

detectable parallax in the stereoscopic pair
and repeating step a;
c) repeating step b as often as required to
identify points of coincidence at all parallax 

depths or slices of the stereoscopic pair;

and
d) building up the 2½D solid model representation by
using software which transforms the slice data so obtained.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which
the stereoscopic pair are multiplexed alternately on a plane

at one relative lateral position and points which appear to
be solid, static and non-flickering are selected to represent

the depth slice, and the pair are then moved laterally
relative to one another by an amount equal to the minimum

detectable parallax in the pair to obtain a further depth
slice.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which
the stereoscopic pair are of different colours, are

multiplexed alternately on a plane at one relative lateral
position and points identified as the colour which is

characteristic of the superimposed coloured images are
selected to represent the depth slice, and the pair are then

moved laterally relative to one another by an amount equal to
the minimum detectable parallax in the pair to obtain a

further depth slice.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which
the stereoscopic pair are compared by superimposing an image

of the pair over the other and delineating points of
coincidence. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which
the stereoscopic pair are compared by subtracting the image

information of one of the pair from the other, at one
relative lateral position to give first depth plane

information, moving the pair laterally relative one another
by the amount equal to the minimum detectable parallax and

again subtracting the image information of one of the pair
from the other to give second depth plane information, and

further subtracting the first depth plane information from
the second depth plane information.
A method of creating a two dimensional solid model
representation of an object with psychological cues to depth,

known as a 2½D solid model representation, for viewing, in
which successive depth plane information is obtained from a

stereoscopic pair of X-ray images of the object by
successively subtracting the image information of one of the

pair from the other of the pair when the pair is superimposed
at one relative lateral superimposition so giving first depth

plane information, moving the pair relative one another by an
amount equal to the minimum detectable parallax in a display

for the images, again subtracting the image information of
one of the pair from the other of the pair at that later

superimposition so giving second depth plane information, and
further subtracting the first depth plane information from

the second depth plane information to provide the unique
depth plane information at the said one relative lateral

superimposition, effecting the said movement and subtractions 
as necessary to provide unique depth plane information for as

many planes as required, the said second depth plane
information being used as the said first depth plane

information in a subsequent step and new second depth plane
information being obtainable after the said movement of the

pair relative one another by an amount equal to the minimum
detectable parallax in a display for the images, and

thereafter building up the 2½D solid model representation by using software which transforms the
depth plane information obtained.
