<CLAIMS>
Method for machining workpieces with laser radiation, in 
which the machining process, particularly the welding in depth 

or the through-welding degree is monitored, in that optical 
and/or acoustical signals emanating from a non-shielding, laser-induced 

plasma are detected and undergo frequency analysis and 
to the result thereof is applied a predetermined arithmetic 

function for determining a weighting variable (B), characterized 
in that the average amplitudes (Ax, Ay) of two different 
frequencies 
band (x, y) of the analyzed frequencies are used with 

the predetermined arithmetic function for determining the 
weighting quantity (B). 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
quotient formation is predetermined as an arithmetic function. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
frequency analysis is performed by means of a fast Fourier 

transformation. 
Method according to one or more of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that means values (B1, B3, B4) for evaluating 

the machining process are obtained from a time variation of the 
weighting quantity (B).
