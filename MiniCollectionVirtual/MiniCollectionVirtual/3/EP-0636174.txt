<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel hyaluronan
receptor protein involved in cell motility and to novel
hyaluronan binding peptides. It relates also to methods
for controlling cell locomotion and for controlling or
treating physiological conditions involving cell
locomotion.In the description which follows, references are
made to certain literature citations which are listed at
the end of the specification.Increased synthesis of hyaluronan (HA) has been
associated with the morphogenesis of many tissues (38),
and with wound repair, tumour invasion and immune
recognition (27,39,40). Further, HA has been proposed to
regulate cell locomotion and cytodifferentiation that
occur during these phenomena (33, 43, 44). HA likely
mediates these effects either by interacting with
specific HA receptors on the cell surface (27,39) or with
certain hyaluronan binding proteins in the extracellular
milieu. High affinity cell binding sites for HA have
previously been demonstrated by kinetic studies on a
variety of cell types (27).A number of cell associated and extracellular HA
binding proteins, including link protein (48,47,8),
CD44 (89, 23, 24, 73, 71, 76, 79), aggrecan (72), versican
(52), GHAP (85), collagen type VI (81) and TSG-6 (51),
have been characterized. In link protein, two tandem
repeat loops have been found to contain HA binding sites
and peptides mimicking specific sequences within these
regions have been shown to bind to HA (8).Prior to the work of the present inventor, however,
the amino acid sequence requirements for HA binding had
not been recognised. It has been observed that the transforming oncogene
H-ras promotes mammalian cell locomotion (17), although
the regulatory mechanisms were unknown. Several
observations suggested that these mechanisms are complex
and involve, at least, the release of autocrine motility
factor(s) (14, 20), growth factors (14) and the
glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (HA) (20,34). In
particular, HA appears to function as an autocrine
mechanism for stimulating maximal locomotion in ras
transformed cells (34). Further, HA is also required for
the ability of an autocrine motility stimulating factor,
to promote breast carcinoma cell locomotion (20).HA promoted, ras transformed cell locomotion
requires the presence of a novel hyaluronan receptor
complex termed HARC (34). This complex of proteins
occurs at the cell surface or is released as soluble
proteins of MWE 72, 68, 58 and 52 kDa proteins (29). The
complex is tightly regulated in vitro (32) and expressed
on the leading
