<ABSTRACT>
A pressure vessel for supplying a liquid at a constant 
flow rate, characterized in that it comprises : a) an 

airtight lockable filling opening for introducing the 
liquid ; b) at the bottom or substantially at the bottom 

an outlet opening (4) for allowing the liquid to flow 
out of the pressure vessel, and c) a vertically or 

substantially vertically extending tube (5) passing 
through the pressure vessel down to a level lower than 

the liquid level so that the hydrostatic pressure on the 
outlet opening remains constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pressure vessel 
for supplying a liquid at a constant flow rate. Both in laboratoria and in the industry 
the problem of adding a liquid at a constant flow rate 
(volume/unit of time) is a very common technique which 
is applied with various means while using different 
methods. These techniques comprise one or more of 
the following solutions : 
a) adding the liquid by means of a pump or by using a 
buret ; b) using a constant pressure vessel, the constant level 
of which is remained constant by a continuous feeding 
through a pump and an overflow from a storage vessel or 
by a level measurement coupled to a valve for allowing 
liquid to enter into the pressure vessel upon lowering 
of the level and closes when the level is reached 
again ; c) a usual vessel on such a height that per dosage the 
liquid to be dosed produces only small fluctuations or 
changes in the total hydrostatic pressure. These devices and working methods show 
different drawbacks : technically complex, high cost 
price, low operational safety and low reproducibility. An objet of the invention is therefore a 
pressure vessel for supplying a liquid at a constant 
flow rate according to the invention which assures the 
desired constant flow rate with technically reliable and 
very simple means.  In order to enable this according to the 
invention, the pressure vessel according to the invention 
comprises : a) an airtight lockable filling 
opening for topping up with liquid ; b) at the bottom or 
substantially at the bottom an outlet opening for 
allowing the liquid to flow out of the pressure vessel, 
and c) a vertically or substantially vertically extending 
tube passing through the pressure vessel down to a 
level lower than the liquid level so that the hydrostatic 
pressure on the outlet opening remains constant. In a preferably applied embodiment said 
tube passes through a screw cap closing off said filling 
opening in an airtight way. According to a possible variant thereof, 
said vertical tube is slidably mounted in said screw cap 
in an airtight way. Other details and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the drawing annexed 
hereto wherein : 
Figure 1 is a front elevational view of 
the pressure vessel according to the invention ; Figure 2 is a side elevational view of the 
same pressure vessel. The pressure vessel shown by these figures 
has to be undeformable and must be lockable in an airtight 
way. The pressure vessel described here by way of 
example may show any shape and may
