<CLAIMS>
Circuit for controlling the electrical current (4) in a
motor (2), comprising a current pick-up (11) connected, via

analogue-to-digital conversion means (12), to means (13) for
controlling a member (15) for controlling the current, which

means are controlled by a control unit (17) isolated
galvanically from the pick-up, said circuit being

characterised by the fact that the current pick-up ((11)
comprises a resistor in series with the motor (2) and that the

controlling means (13) are connected galvanically to the pick-up
(11) via conversion means (12) and isolated galvanically from

the control unit (17).
Circuit according to Claim 1, in which the controlling means
(13) are connected galvanically to the control member (15).
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in which a
microprocessor (14) comprises the conversion means (12) and

the controlling means (13).
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which the
control unit (17) comprises a microprocessor connected to

reference means (18-20) for transmitting a reference signal
(21) to the controlling means (13).
