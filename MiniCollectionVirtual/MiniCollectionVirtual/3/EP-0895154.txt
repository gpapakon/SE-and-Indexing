<ABSTRACT>
A data transferring/receiving apparatus and a data
transmitting system use a user interface that effects natural and

simple data transmission among a plurality of computers.
In the data transmitting system, a plurality of computers in

which an input operation is performed on a display by using
a pen-type input device are connected on a network. Upon

performing an input operation by the pen-type input device,
each computer checks a management table provided on the

network and determines whether management information is
registered. If it is found that the management information

is not registered, the name of the file and the shape of the
icon, which are indicated by the icon selected by the pen-type

input device, are registered as the management
information. If it is found that the management information

is registered, it is obtained. When the pen-type input
device touches the display, a request is provided to the

computer indicated by the management information to transmit
data, and the icon is displayed on the display unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data
transferring/receiving/transferring and receiving apparatus,
a data transmitting system, a data
transferring/receiving/transferring and
receiving/transmitting method, and a data
transferring/receiving/transferring and receiving program
storage medium, all in which data is transferred within a
single computer or data is transmitted among a plurality of
computers.Hitherto, for transferring information displayed on a
screen within a single computer, a user interface technique,
which is referred to as "drag and drop", is used. In the
drag and drop technique, a subject that is being displayed
on a computer screen, for example, an icon, which represents
information concerning a file stored in, for example, a hard 
disk, is clicked and dragged to a desired folder with a
mouse and then dropped there. According to the drag and
drop technique, the user is able to handle a subject
displayed on a computer screen as if he/she were moving a
real object, thereby enabling the user to naturally operate
the computer.However, if it is desired that a subject displayed on a
screen is to be transferred to a different screen, i.e.,
when data, such as a file, is to be transferred between
different computers, a natural user interface technique,
such as the drag and drop technique, is not conventionally
provided. For example, hitherto, if a subject is to be
transferred between different screens, the user is required
to execute a command, such as a remote file copy command or
an information transfer command.In this manner, conventionally, even though a file
transfer operation is performed between different computers,
an operation is disadvantageously conducted on the screen of
a single computer. This type of user interface technique is
far from representing the concept that a real object is
being moved. Thus, the user is unable to perform a natural
and simple operation in order to transfer a file between
different computers.Accordingly, in view of the above background, it is an
object of the present invention to provide a data
transferring/receiving/transferring and receiving apparatus,
a data transmitting system, a data
transferring/receiving/transferring and
receiving/transmitting method, and a data
transferring/receiving/transferring and receiving program
storage medium, all of which use a user interface that
enables natural and simple data transfer in a single
computer or natural and simple data transmission among a
plurality of computers.In order to achieve the above object, according
