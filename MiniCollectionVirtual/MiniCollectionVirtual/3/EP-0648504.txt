<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning and disinfecting method for a contact 
lens comprising immersing a contact lens in a treating 

solution containing a hypohalogenous acid and applying a 
direct current to the treating solution with repeatedly 

reversing a positive electrode and a negative electrode 
plural times, or comprising immersing a contact lens in a 

solution for treatment containing a halide and applying 
a direct current to the solution for treatment with 

repeatedly reversing a positive electrode and a negative 
electrode plural times. According to the cleaning and 

disinfecting methods, a contact lens can be cleaned up and 
disinfected by excellent disinfecting ability and cleaning 

ability of the hypohalogenous acid, and after that, the 
hypohalogenous acid can be immediately reduced and 

detoxicated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning 
and disinfecting method for a contact lens, and more 
particularly to a cleaning and disinfecting method for a 
contact lens, which detoxicates a hypohalogenous acid in a 
short period of time after showing excellent cleaning and 
disinfecting effects of the hypohalogenous acid. A contact lens has some apprehensions that eyes 
are injured when the contact lens is continuously worn in 
eyes as it is for a long period of time because stains in 
the surroundings, microbes, proteins contained in tear 
fluid, and the like adhere to the contact lens while the 
contact lens is worn in eyes. Accordingly, there is 
a necessity to clean up or disinfect the contact lens 
regularly, preferably every day. As a cleaning method for a contact lens, a 
method comprising washing the contact lens with a solution 
containing a surface active agent by fingers has been 
conventionally known, and according to this method, stains 
on the surface of the contact lens can be removed. 
However, for instance, when the method is applied to a 
hard contact lens, there is an apprehension that the hard 
contact lens is broken or damaged during washing. Also, 
when the method is applied to a water-absorptive soft 
contact lens, stains such as proteins, which are 
incorporated in the contact lens, cannot be completely 
removed. Also, as a cleaning method for regenerating and 
reusing a contact lens stained with proteins, a method 
comprising using a cleaning agent containing a 
proteolytic enzyme has been conventionally known. When 
this cleaning method is used, although proteins adhered to 
the surface of the contact lens can be decomposed, it 
takes a long period of time to decompose proteins because 
the enzyme is used. Especially, when a water-absorptive 
soft contact lens is cleaned up by using the cleaning  
 
agent, besides taking a longer period of time for treating 
the water-absorptive soft contact lens in comparison with 
the period of time for treating a hard contact lens, 
sufficient removing effects of proteins cannot be expected 
because the proteolytic enzyme itself should be 
incorporated in a contact lens so that proteins being 
denatured in the internal of the contact lens can be 
decomposed. U.S. Patent No. 4,732,185 discloses a cleaning 
method for a contact lens comprising establishing an 
electric field in a determined direction in a boric 
acid-EDTA buffer solution having pH 8 to 9 and immersing a 
contact lens in the solution to remove proteins from the 
contact lens
