<ABSTRACT>
The method for production of a milk like product is characterized by the fact that transglutaminase is added to a liquid containing milk proteins, that the liquid contains Ca
<

>
, if required, in an amount sufficient for the reaction catalyzed by the transglutaminase, and that the pH of the liquid, if required, is adjusted to a value of between 5.5 and 7.5. Hereby a milk like product which is physically more stable than the hitherto known milk like products is obtained. By further addition of an enzyme with milk clotting activity a milk like product with a mouth feeling like a fat emulsion and usable as a fat substitute can be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a use of a milk like product as a fat
replacer for foods.In this specification with claims
a milk like product
is to be
understood as comprising a product produced with a liquid containing milk proteins
from an animal source as a starting material, examples of liquids containing milk
proteins from an animal source being cow milk, buffalo milk, goat milk, sheep milk,
and animal milk fortified with casein.Thus, the purpose of the invention is the provision of a new use of a
milk like product as a fat replacer for foods, which gives rise to foods which exhibit a
reduced fat content and which exhibit the same good organoleptic properties as the
corresponding fat containing nutrient.Surprisingly, according to the invention it has been found that a milk
like product produced by adding transglutaminase to a liquid containing milk
proteins, which liquid contains Ca++, if required, in an amount sufficient for the
reaction catalyzed by the transglutaminase, and whereby the pH of the liquid, if
required, is adjusted to a value of between 5.5 and 7.5, can be used as a fat
replacer for foods.Typical examples of foods, in which the milk like product can be
incorporated as a fat replacer, are ice cream, toppings, frozen desserts, dressings,
mayonnaises and low fat spreads. As a consequence of this use it is possible to
produce foods which have a reduced calorie content, and which still possess
organoleptic properties similar to the organoleptic properties of foods with a normal
fat content.It is known that milk is physically unstable to protease attack, forming a
coagulum after exposure to proteases, e.g. rennet. This is a desirable property in
regard to cheese production. In other cases, however, this property is undesirable,
especially in relation to long term storage stability of UHT milk. Even if the
microorganisms are killed during the UHT treatment, thermostable proteases
produced by certain microorganisms may not be completely inactivated during the
UHT treatment, and in such cases the UHT milk is physically unstable during long
term storage. However, the milk like product used as a fat replacer for foods
according to the invention is extremely stable. Documentation will be presented later
in this specification. Especially it has been found that the fat replacer used according 
to the invention, if UHT treated, exhibits a satisfactory long term physical storage
stability.If according to the invention cow milk is used as the liquid containing
milk proteins it has been found that
