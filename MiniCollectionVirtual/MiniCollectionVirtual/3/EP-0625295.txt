<ABSTRACT>
A means for simplifying fault location in an optical signal transmission network in which a main optical fibre is divided into a plurality of branch circuits, comprises optical time domain reflectrometry (OTDR) equipment for transmitting an output signal along the main fibre, and for each branch circuit means for causing the signal returned to the OTDR equipment from the branch to be modified in a manner unique to that branch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical signal transmission 
networks, as may be used, for example, in optical fibre 
telecommunications, and relates, in particular, to a fault location 
and diagnostic systems for use with such networks. Over the past decade, optical time domain reflectometry, 
hereinafter referred to as OTDR, has become an established tool for 
the location and evaluation of the features on an optical fibre 
route. For example, OTDR techniques are now commonly used to 
determine both the position and loss of splices and connectors and 
the position of line breaks as well as providing a means for making 
single-ended, real-time system loss measurements. In use of an optical time domain reflectometer a short 
pulse of light is launched into an optical fibre under test and the 
backscattered signal is monitored as a function of the time of 
flight (or equivalently distance) along the fibre. The magnitude 
of the backscattered signal depends on the Rayleigh scattering, 
attenuation, inhomogeneities, splices, components and the optical 
power level in the fibre. Features in the trace of backscatter 
versus time may then be correlated with the presence of 
discontinuities and disruptions in the fibre route. Whilst OTDR techniques are extremely valuable as a  
 
diagnostic tool for the location of faults in simple point to 
point links there is now an increasing trend towards more complex 
passive optical networks. In such networks a number of branch circuits may emanate 
from a single optical fibre connected, for example to a telephone 
exchange, and the branch circuits may be further divided into 
further branch circuits. Such an arrangement can provide a 
significant cost reduction by utilising the available bandwidth 
to share said single exchange fibre amongst a number of 
customers, thereby reducing the level of exchange equipment and 
fibre installation costs borne by each customer. It will, however, be apparent that when a signal from OTDR 
equipment is transmitted along said single fibre, and thence to 
the branch circuits, the signal which is returned at any instant, 
following the transmission of an output signal from the OTDR 
equipment, will be made up of light backscattered from many 
points in the network at the same distance from the equipment. 
This makes the location of a fault in the network difficult and 
time-consuming. In PCT application WO 90/06498 a method is described of 
detecting loss in a branched optical fibre network comprising a 
first optical fibre and a plurality of

optical fibre (8) having a plurality of branch circuits (21, 

22, 23, 24) and having an optical time domain reflectometer

modulating means (31, 32, 33, 34), adjacent to the branch 

point (A, B) for modulating backscattered light from the

to that branch (21, 22, 23, 24) and the OTDR incorporating 
detecting means for distinguishing the signals returned from 

the individual branch circuits (21, 22, 23, 24).

1, wherein the modulating means is arranged to modulate the 

state of polarisation of the backscattered light. 
An optical signal transmission network as claimed in Claim 
2, wherein the detecting means comprises means for splitting 

the returned signals into two orthogonal components.
