<ABSTRACT>
A device for a stocking turning apparatus automatically separates partially turned stockings from completely turned stockings. All stockings (C) leaving the automatic stocking turning apparatus (1) are guided on a slide (2) to a pneumatic ejection tube (4) which bears photoelectric cells (5, 7) with their respective reflectors (6, 8). The adjustable distance between both photoelectric cells is adjusted so that when a stocking is completely turned, its point (C') and its edge (C'') simultaneously darken both photoelectric cells. A cylinder (9) is then actuated, so that a guiding slide (10) linked thereto takes a discarding position indicated in the drawing by continuous lines and the stocking falls in the container (12). The guiding slide (10) then returns to its initial position. When a stocking is not completely turned, both photoelectric cells (5, 7) are not simultaneously darkened, the cylinder (9) is not actuated, the guiding slide (10) remains in the vertical position and the stocking falls into the other container (11).

Device for an automatic sock turning apparatus charged by a 
linking machine, characterised by 


means (5,6,7,8) for measuring the length of the sock (C), 
which means are arranged along the path of the sock after having 

been turned, 
deflector means (10) for determining the conveying way of the 
turned sock along one of two alternative, different ejection 

paths, depending on whether the sock (C), at the exit of the 
sock turning apparatus, has been completely or only partially 

turned, 
actuating means (9) controlled by said measuring means 
(5,6,7,8) and by said deflector means (10) such that the sock is 

being directed to the one or to the other of said two ejection 
paths, depending on whether it has been completely or partially 

turned. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the measuring means comprise 
a sensor detecting the passage of a sock, an element for 

detecting the operating duration of said sensor and a comparator 
circuit for comparing said sensor operating duration with a 

predetermined standard time which may be adjusted dependent on 
the length of the sock to be turned. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the measuring means comprise 
two sensors detecting the passage of a sock and having an 

adjustable distance between each other which is equal to or only 
slightly shorter than the length of a completely turned sock. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the sensors 
detecting the passage of a sock consist of beam detecting 

elements, preferably photocells (5, 7), connected to a control 
circuit.  

 
Device according to claim 3 or 4, wherein to the end of the 
ejector tube (4) are fastened in adjustable positions two collar 

bands, each of which carrying, in diametrically opposite positions, 
a photocell (5, 7) and a corresponding reflector (6, 8). 
Device according to claim 5, wherein below the downwardly directed 
exit at the end of the ejector tube (4) is fastened a deflector 

chute (10) hingedly mounted to a horizontal axis and 
connected with a lever which is coupled to the piston rod of a 

cylinder (9), said deflector chute (10) may have a vertical or 
an inclined position depending on whether the piston rod of the 

cylinder (9) is retracted or extended, the position of said 
piston rod within its cylinder (9) being controlled by pulses 

sent from said photocells (5, 7) to said control circuit. 
Device according to claim 6, wherein the control circuit is 
interlocked with said photocells (5, 7) such that it may expel 

the piston rod from the cylinder (9) for moving the deflector 
chute (10) into its inclined position when both photocells (5, 

7) are simultaneously darkened by the edge (C") and by the 
point (C') of the sock (C) introduced into the ejector tube (4). 
Device according to claim 6, wherein the control circuit is 
interlocked with both photocells (5, 7) such that the piston rod 

is being retracted into the cylinder (9) for moving the 
deflector chute (10) into its vertical position when both 

potocells (5, 7) are simultaneously darkened by the edge (C") 
and by the point (C') of the sock (C) introduced into the 

ejector tube (4).
