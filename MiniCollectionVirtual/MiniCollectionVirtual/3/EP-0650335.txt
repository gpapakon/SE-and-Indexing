<ABSTRACT>
A hairdrying apparatus (10) having a motor (13), driven blower assembly (12) and a C-shaped air duct (22) of tubular construction discharging through on outlet adjacent the palm of the user's hand is mountable directly on the user's hand without the aid of additional straps. The air duct (22) is configured to extend tightly around an edge of the hand (11) and secure the dryer (10) to the hand as a result of the inherent compression of the C-shape of the duct (22) against the topside and palm of the hand. A layer of resiliently compressible thermal and electrical insulation material (30) may be provided on the surfaces (28) of the duct contacted by the hand (11) to further aid in securing the apparatus to the hand (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable hairdrying
apparatus, and more particularly to a hairdrying
apparatus mountable on the back of the hand of the user
and having a discharge duct which secures the apparatus
to the hand without the aid of a strap.Attempts have been made to improve the process of drying
hair while allowing the hair stylist to have full use of
his or her hands. One such device is inventor's prior
U.S. Patent No. 4,138,827, which discloses a wrist
mounted hair dryer comprising a motor driven air blower
having an air inlet and an air outlet. Further, U.S.
Patent No. 4,620,374 teaches the use of a hairstylist
glove.Other hairdrying apparatuses are shown and taught in the
following utility patents: U.S. Patent Nos. : 4,890,395
illustrates and teaches a hand held dryer; 4,370,544
discloses a flat and compact dryer; 3,986,272 shows a
dryer with a pivotably attached hand grip; 3,861,060
discloses a dryer with an arched tube designed to be
held in the hand and swept forwardly and rearwardly
over the crown of the head; 3,955,065 illustrates
a spherical casing on a hand-held dryer.Various U.S. design patents teach or illustrate
different types of housings and ducts, but none of the
following design patents teach the unique art duct
function following design patents teach the unique art
duct function or configuration of the present
invention: D287,297 D3Ol,23l, D294,740; D30915l0; 
D272,lOl; D265,002; D309,195; D294,873; D289,566;
D2731141; D265,5l4; and D254,45l.The following foreign patents show hairdrying devices:
French patent 424,749 illustrates a hand held dryer.
French patent 454,686 teaches a dryer which discharges
air from a funnel in the user's palm. Japanese patent
J63229097A discloses a bedding dryer with a U-shaped
handle, but the handle is not an air duct.According to the invention there is provided a dryer
apparatus for mounting on a user's hand without the aid
of a strap as claimed in Claims 1 to 5.The present invention is a strapless, hand-mounted
hairdryer having an air blower assembly and an arcuate
discharge duct conforming to the user's hand and
extending from the output of the blower, which both
secures the blower on the hand of the user and directs
the air flow to the palm of the hand. The present
invention may be quickly transferred from one hand
to the other during the hairdrying operation because
of its generally C-shaped configuration and easy,
strapless release of the unit from the hand.The discharge duct is designed to urge against the hand
in a slight clamping
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dryer apparatus (10) for mounting on a user's hand
(11) without the aid of a strap comprising a motor

driven air blower means (15) having an air inlet (20) and
an air outlet (19), a C-shaped air duct (22) of tubular

construction having first and second ends and an air
discharge port (24), the first end being secured to

said blower means (15) in communication with said air
outlet, wherein the said C-shaped air duct (22) is

adapted to urge against said user's hand (11) and
secure said dryer apparatus (10) thereto.
A dryer apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said
C-shaped duct (22) has an upper portion (33) adapted

to overlie the top of said user's hand (11) and a
lower portion (26) adapted to underlie the palm of

said user's hand (11), the said upper portion (33)
being spaced apart from the said lower portion (26)

less at an open side of said C-shaped duct (22) than
at a closed side of said C-shaped duct (22).
A dryer apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
said C-shaped duct (22) is made of a material having a

small amount of inherent resiliency.
A dryer apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein the said C-shaped air duct (22) further

comprises a means (30) to thermally and electrically
insulate said dryer (10) from said user's hand (11),

said insulating means (30) being resilient and having
a thicker portion near said second end of said duct

(22), said thicker portion extending along an inside
surface of said duct (22) from an open side to a

closed side of said duct (22) for further urging said
duct (22) against said user's hand (11) . 
A dryer apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein said C-shaped duct (22) further comprises a

lower section adjacent said second end, the air
discharge port (24) being located in said lower

section, and means for connecting styling attachments
(42) to said lower section such that air discharged

from said port (24) flows through and around said
attachments (42).
