<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns an automatic control system for lights in a series circuit illumination plant, in particular lights for airport signalling or lamps for road lighting, motorway lighting or for private areas (large industrial areas). It is characterised in that it is physically distinct from the work circuit feeding the lights and galvanically separate from the latter. This system allows the lights to be switched on and off, and more importantly allows them to be switched on and off individually and not all together. This system permits one to have an always up-to-date picture of the state of operation of all the lights and is predisposed for activating alarms if necessary, or indication of breakdown for the human operator. Since all devices able to recognise and distinguish the type of vehicules which move on various airport runways and taxiways may also be connected to it, this system is proposed as a complete system for running airport ground traffic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an automatic control 
system of lights in a series circuit illumination 
system, in particular for lights for airport signalling. 
It is furthermore possible to utilise the same system 
for automatic control of road or motorway (motorway 
crossings or ramps) illumination plants or even for 
controlling the illumination plant of large industrial 
areas. Airport signalling lights or runway lights are not 
limited to those which illuminate the landing strip to 
make it well visible to pilots, but also include the 
taxiway or runway centreline lights which are arranged 
on the axis of the taxiways, the take-off strip and the 
routes between the taxiway and the various parking 
areas. The characteristics, arrangement and functioning 
of these lights are disciplined by the regulations of 
the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) 
which is the international body which controls flight 
regulations including also those to be respected in the 
movement of aircraft and vehicles on the ground, in 
order to guarantee collective safety. The presence of 
these lights has, in fact, the purpose of giving the  
 
pilots and drivers of vehicles circulating in the 
airport area (such as ambulances, fire engines, vehicles 
for passenger transport, vehicles for baggage transport, 
etc) an exact indication of the whereabouts of various 
airport sectors which can be driven on also in 
conditions of unfavourable visibility, in particular 
enabling aircraft pilots to avoid any collisions with 
the wing tips and to align the aircraft along the axis 
of the taxiways and the take-off strip. The use of lights for airport signalling has been 
proposed in the art as a visual means for disciplining 
the airport ground traffic in a centralised manner and 
thus taking it away from the judgement of individual 
drivers, something which, however, leads to situations 
of chaos very similar to those encountered in urban 
motor vehicle traffic. In particular, from the control 
tower the central lights of the route to be taken are 
activated progressively in front of the aircraft or 
motor vehicle to be moved, which is thus enabled to 
follow. At the intersection between two or more taxiways 
stop bar lights are positioned horizontally and across 
the entire width of the individual taxiway. Said stop 
bar lights if lit up indicate the obligation to stop. 
In short it concerns a "stop-go" system of guiding the 
pilot or driver of the motor vehicle, which substitutes  
 
and surpasses the function of the

Automatic control system for the lights (3) of an 
illumination plant in a series circuit, in particular for 

airport signalling lights (3), physically separated from the 
work circuit feeding said lights (3) and galvanically 

separated from the latter, comprising: 

a suitable computer (HOST1); 
several Main Stations (SP) each containing several 
Main Modules (MM), that is firmware boards, each controlling 

several Remote Modules (RM01), which are also firmware 
boards, which check and act on a single airport light (3); 
a full duplex data transmission network (1,2) which 
connects the above mentioned components of the system 

together, 
 
   characterised in that each Remote Module (RM) has 

externally two couples (A,B;C,D) of electric terminals of 
which one (A,B) is connected to the secondary of an 

insulating transformer (4) making part of said work circuit 
and the other (C,D) is connected to a light (3) or a group 

of lights (3) being controlled, these two couples (A,B;C,D) 
of electric terminals being connected to each other by 

electrical leads, connected in series to one of these is a 
coil (L1) which is magnetically coupled to a Hall sensor  

 
(HALL) making part of the internal electronic components of 

the Remote Module (RM) and being two terminals of a TRIAC, 
or another equivalent electronic device with controlled 

conduction, each connected with one of the above mentioned 
electric leads while the control terminal is connected to 

the primary of an impulse transformer which connects it 
magnetically to the internal circuit of the Remote Module 

(RM) itself. 
Control system as in Claim 1, characterised in that 
it activates switching on or switching off of each 

individual airport light (3), independently from the 
commutators of said work circuit, giving the Remote Module 

(RM) controlling it commands which, respectively, bring the 
said Triac to complete cut-off or full conduction, as in the 

first case there is no current absorption by the Triac from 
the two electrical leads which connect together the two said 

couples (A,B;C,D) of external terminals of the Remote Module 
(RM) and short circuiting the same and thus the airport 

light (3) which is fed by these in the second case. 
Control system as in Claim 2, characterised in 
that, when a certain airport light (3) is burnt out the said 

coil (L1) in series with one of the said electric leads 
which connect together the two couples (A,B;C,D) of external 

terminals of the Remote Module (RM) controlling said light 

(3), no longer communicating the passage of the current  
 

towards the light (3) to said Hall sensor (HALL) to which it 
is magnetically coupled, circuitally causes said Triac to be 

brought to a state of partial conduction that simulates to 
the secondary of said insulation transformer (4) the load 

determined by the functioning light (3) in order not to 
create imbalances in said work circuit and contemporaneously 

causes the "condition of the light" stored in the relative 
memory of the internal circuit of the Remote Module (RM) to 

be changed from "ON" to "BURNT OUT". 
Control system as in Claim 1, 2 or 3 characterised 
in that each Remote Module (RMO1) is able to control several 

airport lights (3) contemporaneously, provided that these 
are grouped within the same physical location. 
Control systems as in any claim 1 to 4, 
characterized in that said full duplex data transmission 

network (1,2) comprises: 

a ring network (1) which connects to each other the 
said main stations (SP), which have access to it by means of 

suitable Concentrators (CT); 
a network (2), which may be in particular an 
Ethernet network, connecting the above mentioned ring 

network (1) to said computer (HOST1) by means of a 
Concentrator Node (NC) positioned between these; 
a plurality of cables which connect each of the said 
Main Modules (MM) to said Remote Modules (RM) which it may  

 
control. 
Control system as in Claim 5, characterised in that 
in the said network (2) connecting the said ring network (1) 

to the said computer (HOST1), there is a second computer 
(HOST2) which is constantly updated with the information 

contained in the first (HOST1) and may substitute it in any 
moment that the latter (HOST1) undergoes a breakdown. 
Control system as in Claim 5, characterised in 
that: 


each of the said main stations (SP) is fed 
autonomously by two buffered feeders, of which one functions 

as a reserve; 
the said Remote Modules (RM) are fed by an 
appropriate electric lead by feeders distributed along said 

cables which connect them to the said main module (MM) which 
commands it, the said lead being connected electrically 

between the external sheath of said cables and insulated 
from the lead where the two-way transmission of data takes 

place. 
Control system as in any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that connected to each Remote Module (RM) 

is a sensor applied to the airport light (3), able to 
evaluate the condition of transparency of the glass which 

covers the light (3) itself, and adding to the present 
"condition of the light" stored in said memory, the  

 
information of "DIRTY" light when the above mentioned sensor 

communicates this condition to the internal circuit of the 
Remote Module (RM). 
Control system as in the preceding claims, 
characterised in that said computer (HOST1) periodically 

sends to individual Remote Modules (RM) messages containing 
the address which identifies them in the said full-duplex 

data transmission network (1,2) and the command to be 
carried out, which may be that of switching on (ON) or 

switching off (OFF) or that of switching on again after 
replacement of the relative light (3) (RESET), and the 

individual Remote Modules (RM) sends back, by means of the 
Main Module (MM) which drives it, a message containing its 

address as well as information stored in the said memory on 
the "Condition of the light" controlled, thus giving the 

above mentioned computer (HOST1) the possibility of being up 
to date on the functional condition of the individual 

airport lights (3) and if necessary activating the alarms or 
signals provided for the human operator. 
Control system as in one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the Remote Module (RM02) 

controls and acts on two airport lights (3) independently. 
Control system as in any one of the claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that the Remote Module (RM05) identifies 16 

separate inputs of respective sensors and commands 6  
 

separate outputs for their diagnosis or to control 
particular functions. 
Control system as in any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that this system is utilisable in 

illumination plants for roads, motorways or large industrial 
areas.
