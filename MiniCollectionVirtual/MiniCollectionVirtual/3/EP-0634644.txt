<ABSTRACT>
The described measuring device is based on the NDIR method. Pulsed infrared light passes, parallel in two beam paths (3, 4), first through a cuvette (6) filled with 
<

>
CO2 and a cuvette (7) filled with 
<
12
>
CO2 and subsequently, likewise parallel, through two cuvettes (8, 9) which are filled with the gas sample to be analysed. The latter two cuvettes (8,9) form, together with a capacitor microphone (15) acting as a pressure transducer, an optopneumatic detector (17). By regulating the pressure in one of the former two cuvettes (6), the minimum in the pressure-transducer signal is searched for and is related to a correspondingly obtained reference value. The device, which is simple to produce, allows cost-effective implementation of
