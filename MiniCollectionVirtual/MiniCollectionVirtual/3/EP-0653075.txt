<ABSTRACT>
An optical system operable to focus an annular beam of light onto a spot (16) comprises a paraboloidal reflector (10) with a lamp (12) at its focus, a coaxial annular convex lens (13) and a coaxial internally silvered conical mirror (15). A parallel beam of light formed by reflection by the reflector (10) of light from the lamp (12), is formed into a convergent annular beam by the lens (13) and reflected by the mirror (15) which is located between the lens (13) and its focus so that it converges to the spot (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical system operable 
to focus an annular beam of light onto a spot. In reflection densitometry there is often a 
requirement to illuminate a sample at 45° with 
light of a narrow beam width, see ISO Standard 5/4 
'Geometric conditions for reflection density'. This 
ideally takes place over a full 360° cone to 
ensure that the orientation of directionally 
reflective materials does not effect the resulting 
measurement. If an optical system for forming a narrow annular 
beam converging at 45° onto a spot on a sample to 
illuminate that spot is formed substantially as is 
described in GB-A-2191572 or, alternatively, 
comprises a lamp mounted at the centre of the 
reflective surface of a paraboloidal reflector so as 
to produce a substantially parallel beam of light, a 
disc mounted co-axially with the axis of the 
paraboloidal reflector in the path of the parallel 
beam of light so as to restrict that beam such that 
the light that passes it is an annular, parallel beam 
of light co-axial with the axis of the reflector, and 
a simple converging lens mounted co-axially with the 
axis of the paraboloidal reflector on the other side 
of the disc remote from the paraboloidal reflector 
whereby the annular parallel beam is caused to 
converge and focus on the spot which is on the axis 
of the paraboloidal reflector, the required lens  
 
must have a large f/no. This is difficult to achieve 
and, in addition, there is little space available 
between the lens and the sample to house the 
necessary detector which senses light reflected by 
the sample perpendicular to its plane. An object of this invention is to provide an optical 
system which more easily achieves the desired result 
than is the case when a simple converging lens is 
used and which provides adequate space for 
accommodation of a detector operable to sense the 
light reflected perpendicular to the sample plane. US-A-4422135 discloses the use of an aspherical 
mirror arranged so that its reflecting surface has an 
annular concave form extending around an axis of 
rotational symmetry, the radial cross-section being 
that of an elliptical segment. A cylindrical 
mirror is connected to the radially outer edge of the 
aspherical mirror and focuses the convergent annular 
beam to form a single spot image on the axis of the 
annular beam. Although this arrangement eliminates 
the need for a lens having a large f/no it does not 
increase the space available to house the detector. According to this invention there is
