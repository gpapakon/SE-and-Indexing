<ABSTRACT>
An active component of parathyroid hypertensive factor which comprises a polypeptide linked to a phospholipid has been identified. The component exhibits activities substantially similar to parathyroid hypertensive factor and therefore is indicated in the control of extracellular calcium uptake, and is related to hypertension and some other diseases in mammals. Methods for screening patients for the presence of the circulating factor using antibodies against the component are described. Antagonists of the parathyroid hypertensive factor component have been developed and the use of such antagonists in methods of treating patients with diseases which involve intracellular calcium elevation are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ACTIVE COMPONENT OF PARATHYROID HYPERTENSIVE FACTORField of the InventionThis invention relates to the identification, characterization and synthesis of an active component of parathyroid hypertensive factor which comprises a polypeptide linked to a phosphoglyceride (sometimes referred to as phospholipid) . The component exhibits activities substantially similar to parathyroid hypertensive factor and therefore is indicated in the control of extracellular calcium uptake, and is related to hypertension and some other diseases in mammals. Methods for screening patients for the presence of the circulating factor using antibodies against the component are described. Antagonists of the parathyroid hypertensive factor component have been developed and the use of such antagonists in methods of treating patients with diseases which involve intracellular calcium elevation are also described.Background of the InventionHypertension is generally defined as the elevation of the systolic and/or diastolic arterial blood pressure above a nominal value of 140/90 mm Hg. Diseases associated with hypertension include arteriosclerosis, hypertensive renal failure, stroke, congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction. Although numerous methods of treatment have been found to be effective in the reduction of arterial blood pressure, the etiology of essential hypertension remains essentially unknown. A genetic predisposition to hypertension is generally accepted, but the number of different drugs which have been found effective in the treatment of hypertension, and the fact that these drugs seem to operate by eliciting different pharmacological responses, suggests that there may be different primary causes for essential hypertension. 

 A number of studies have suggested that one or more circulating factors may play a role in the genesis or the maintenance of hypertension [See: Wright et al., A Hypertensive Substance Found in the Blood of Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats; Life Sci. 1984; 34:1521-1528; Dahl et al.. Humoral Transmission of Hypertension: Evidence from Parabiosis; Circ. Res. 1969; 24/25 (Suppl. I):21-23; Greenberg et al., Evidence for Circulating Factors as a Cause of Venous Hypertrophy in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats; Am. J.
