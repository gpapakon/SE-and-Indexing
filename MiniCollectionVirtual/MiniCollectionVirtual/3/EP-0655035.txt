<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic 
control system of an automatic transmission for a 
vehicle and, more particularly, to the hydraulic control 
system which can improve shift feeling and fuel 
consumption ratio by permitting a 5-speed change to be 
realized and a line pressure to be variably controlled. Generally, a conventional automatic transmission 
for a vehicle includes a torque converter, a multi-stage 
shift gear mechanism connected to the torque converter, 
and a plurality of friction elements, which are actuated 
by hydraulic pressure, for selecting one of the gear 
stages of the shift gear mechanism. The hydraulic pressure pressurized by an oil pump 
is supplied to the friction elements and a plurality of 
control valves. The torque converter includes a pump impeller 
connected to an output shaft of an engine to rotate 
therewith, a turbine runner connected to an input shaft 
of the transmission to operate therewith, and a stator 
located between the pump impeller and the turbine 
runner. Automatic speed change is realized by a planetary 
gear unit operated by the friction elements such as  
 
clutches or a kick-down band brake. The friction elements are selectively actuated by 
the valves of the hydraulic control system which change 
the direction of the hydraulic pressure. A manual valve 
is designed to receive the hydraulic pressure from the 
oil pump through a port, which is closed or opened in 
accordance with position of a shift lever, and connected 
to a shift control valve by a passage to supply the 
hydraulic pressure thereto. Such an automatic transmission for vehicle is 
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,842. WO-A-94/15809 describes a shift control device of 
a hydraulic control system for an automatic transmission 
comprising a pressure regulating valve, a pressure 
supply converting valve, a clutch converting regulating 
valve, valve spools of the pressure regulating valve and 
clutch converting regulating valve receive variable 
force according to opening or closing operation of 
associated solenoid for exhausting or interrupting a 
hydraulic pressure regulated by a solenoid supply valve 
(referred to as a reducing valve) 42 for making a 
pressure lower than a line pressure protecting an 
hydraulic pressure line. The reducing valve provides a 
controlled hydraulic pressure torque control regulating 
valve for generating an engaging pressure required to 
the operation of the clutch and to a control switch 
valve 52 for dividing the hydraulic pressure to a first 
speed
