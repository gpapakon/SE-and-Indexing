<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the identification of
antigenic portions of malaria proteins, their expression
in host cells, particularly bacteria, and their potential
use as a vaccine.Malaria is caused by protozoal parasites of the genus
Plasmodium. There are four species that infect man, P.
falciparumP, vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale. Of these
P. falciparum is largely responsible for acute and often
fatal malaria, but there is significant morbidity
associated with each malaria infection and a large
proportion of the world's population is at risk from the
disease. It has been estimated that malaria is a public
health problem in areas where 40% of the world's
population live and the disease has severe social and
economic consequences for these communities. There has
been a recent resurgence of the disease due to the
abandonment or breakdown of control measures and to an
increasing resistance of the vector to insecticides and
falciparum malaria to chemotherapy. Thus there is an
urgent need to develop a vaccine effective against
malaria.Most attempts to develop a vaccine have focused on trying
to identify single proteins that are capable of inducing 
protective immune responses in the host against the
relevant species and stage of parasite. This is in itself
an enormous task because of the complexity of the
parasite's life cycle, the number and diversity of
antigens within the spectrum of polypeptides synthesised,
and the superficial understanding we have of the important
aspects of the immune system that control malaria.
Nevertheless, several proteins have been identified by
using monoclonal antibodies, sera from immune individuals
and antibodies to fragments of genes expressed from
libraries in bacteria. Using a variety of criteria,
including the effects of antibodies in vitro or in vivo on
the parasite's growth and development, direct immunization
studies, and subcellular location or possible function of
the protein, several vaccine candidates have been
proposed.One such candidate is the Merozoite Surface Protein-1
(abbreviated to MSP1, but also known as MSA1, PMMSA, P.190
or gP195) located on the exterior of the merozoite, the
parasite stage which invades erythrocytes. MSP1 is found
on the merozoite surface of all malaria parasite species
and is therefore an ideal target for a candidate-malaria
vaccine. The precursor protein is, in fact,
proteolytically processed to form a complex of several
polypeptides of differing molecular weights (Holder et
al., [1987] Parasitology 94, 199-208).It has been
