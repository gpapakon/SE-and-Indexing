<ABSTRACT>
The invention has produced a method for folding an air bag (15) by means of which the storage shape of the air bag is adapted to a trapezoidal casing (10). To achieve this, the airbag is folded in such a way that by initially taking the form of a web with parallel sides, the air bag is first further reduced in size to form a rectangle, after which process points are formed by diagonal folding (fold E) and further folding (fold F) at an angle causes the points to come to rest above recesses (8) into which the said points can be inserted from the previous folding plane.

A method of folding an airbag (15) for accommodation in a
housing (10) in which an inflation device (9) and the folded airbag

(15) are accommodated, the side of the housing facing the
vehicle occupant being provided with a covering cap and having

recesses (8) adjacent to obliquely extending sidewalls (13, 14),
characterised in that the airbag (15) is folded into points (20)

adjacent to the obliquely extending sidewalls (13, 14) and the
points (20) are inserted into the recesses (8).
A method according to claim 1, characterised by the following
steps for folding the airbag (15) into points:


the airbag (15) is folded into a strip (18) with parallel sides;
one half (19) of the strip (18) is folded back about a first folding
line (C);
the free end of the half (19) of the strip (18) is folded diagonally
about a second folding line (E), the second folding line (E)

extending through one corner of the free end, and this corner
forming the point (20);
the strip (18) is folded diagonally about a third folding line (F) in
the opposite direction, the third folding line (F) extending

substantially through a central point (M) of the housing (10)
and being arranged so that the point (20) comes to lie beyond

the recess (8); 
the point (20) is inserted into the recess (8) by bending the
point (20) at right angles out of the folding plane, and
the second half of the strip is folded in a corresponding
manner.
An airbag (15) for an impact protection device for vehicle
occupants, comprising a tub-shaped housing (10) in which an

inflation device (9) and the folded airbag (15) are
accommodated, the side of the housing facing the vehicle

occupant being provided with a covering cap and having
recesses (8) adjacent to obliquely extending sidewalls (13, 14),

characterised in that the airbag (15) is folded into points (20)
adjacent to the obliquely extending sidewalls (13, 14) and the

points (20) are inserted into the recesses (8).
An airbag (15) according to claim 3, characterised in that the
airbag (15) is folded into a strip (18) so as to be parallel with

parallel housing walls (11, 12) of a housing (10) for holding the
airbag (15), and each corresponding half of the strip (18) has:


in a lower packing position, a first fold (C) extending inside the
housing (10) and outside the recess (8) at right angles to the

longitudinal extent of the strip (18), and
in an upper packing position, a central fold (F) extending
substantially through a central point (M) of the housing (10) so that

the point (20) comes to lie beyond the recess (8),
the sides of a triangle, forming the point (20), being formed on
one side by a diagonal fold (E) extending through one corner of

the free end of the strip (19), and on the other side by the edge of
the strip (19).
