<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a vibration cancellation device for rigidly mounting to or 
forming part of an apparatus subject to vibration. The device comprises a mass (14) 

supported by magnetic levitation but which is magnetically driven to provide vibration - 
cancelling relative movement, movement sensors (18, 20, 26) controlling the application 

of power, in a relative motion cancellation direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a vibration cancellation device. There is a considerable
potential for an active vibration cancellation device able to reduce overall vibration of
mechanical structures. Such devices could be attached to or embedded in struts,
pipes or masts that are subject to vibration forces in order to eliminate these by active
cancellation techniques. In addition, machinery is conventionally mounted on some
type of passive mounting arrangement to reduce the severity of transmitted vibration
to a supporting structure therefor. The use of an active vibration cancellation device,
mounted near the base of such passive mounts can be used substantially to improve
overall performance by cancelling vibrations which would otherwise be transmitted into
the supporting structure.Active vibration cancellation has been experimented with in the past particularly
in the case of engines running at a steady speed where the vibration energy spectrum
has a significant content in only a few harmonics of the engine rotation rate. This
allows one to use narrow-band active cancellation techniques only, which techniques
are the simplest to implement. The cancellation technique tried was to use oscillating
masses to suppress the resultant narrow band mechanical vibrations. However,
heretofore, to generate an anti-phase momentum in a required direction, the oscillating
mass had to be mechanically supported. A linear oscillating mass of an active
vibration canceller is described in, for example, the journal of the Chartered
Mechanical Engineer, January 1983, pages 41 to 47 (particularly page 44 and Fig. 13)
in a paper by G.B.B. Chaplin. Other active vibration cancelling devices are described 
and shown in UK Patent Specifications Nos. 1,601,096 and 2,222,279. Usually, some
form of diaphragm or spider support was provided to limit motion of the mass to the
correct axis. In practise, such linear supports, spiders or diaphragms proved to be
unreliable, through wear and fatigue. There was also a more significant objection: they
could not easily withstand shock loading. This, along with their demonstrated
unreliability, resulted in the idea largely being dropped. A vibration cancellation device is known from EPA 0 338 993 comprising
a substantially spherical housing which is to be mounted on a structure that is
otherwise subject to vibrations, a substantially spherical auxiliary mass freely
positioned within the housing, a magnetic levitation means capable of moving
the auxiliary mass in three linear degrees of freedom
