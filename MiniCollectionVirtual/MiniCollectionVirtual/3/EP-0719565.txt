<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a safety stop push button mechanism that prevents unwanted 
activation of the push button. This invention has particular applicability to a catheter and 

spring activated safety introducer needle assembly. A projection extending from the 
activation latch engages the catheter hub to prevent inadvertent activation of the safety 

mechanism until the catheter has been at least partially advanced distally over the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent relates generally to a safety stop push button feature that could be used
on most any push button activation mechanism to prevent unwanted activation of the push
button. This invention has particular applicability for use in a spring actuated safety
introducer needle assembly which may be used with an intravenous (IV) catheter.With the advent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other infectious
diseases, there has been much concern with accidental needle sticks of healthcare workers
by used IV catheter introducer needles. As a result many companies have attempted to
develop a safety needle system that would allow the healthcare worker to shield the sharp
distal tip of the needle after the catheter has been placed in a patient's vein. One such
system is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,747,831, the disclosure of which is hereby
incorporated by reference.In that system, the needle hub and introducer needle are slidably disposed in a hollow
barrel with the sharp distal tip of the needle initially extending beyond the distal end of the
barrel. A spring is located between the needle hub and the distal end of the barrel. A latch
is used to keep the needle hub adjacent to the distal end of the barrel so the sharp distal tip
of the needle extends beyond the distal end of the barrel. After the introducer needle and
catheter have been properly inserted into the patient's vein, the latch is activated allowing
the spring to force the needle hub to the proximal end of the barrel. As a result, the sharp
distal tip of the needle is withdrawn into the barrel out of reach of the healthcare worker.Although the above described device works for its intended purpose, it could be
improved. Since the device is spring activated, movement of the latch will allow the spring to
withdraw the needle into the barrel. Unfortunately, in certain circumstances, the healthcare
worker may inadvertently depress the latch prior to the catheter being properly placed in the
patient's vein. According to US 5, 338,331, a needle-syringe assembly, operable in a normal
mode and convertible to a retraction mode, comprises an elongated, generally
cylindrical barrel, a plunger slideably mounted in the barrel, and a needle holder
carrying a hollow needle on the distal end thereof. The barrel forms a hollow nozzle
located at the distal end of the barrel. The plunger forms a coaxial cavity extending
therethrough, and the plunger, includes a helical slot exposing a proximal portion of the
coaxial cavity. The needle holder is slidably

<CLAIMS>
A medical device, comprising:

a handle (31) having a proximal end and a distal end;
a carrier (33) disposed for movement with respect to the handle (31);
a hub (22) movably located adjacent to the handle (31); and
an activation latch (34) adapted for selective engagement with the carrier (33);

   
characterized in that

   a projection (40) extends from the activation latch (34) for engagement with the
hub (22) to prevent movement of the activation latch (34) when the hub (22) is adjacent

to the handle (31).
The medical device of claim 1 wherein the projection (40) has a length of
between about 0.5 mm and about 2.5 mm.
The medical device of claim 1 or 2 wherein the projection (40) is wedge
shaped.
The medical device of claim 3 wherein the wedge shaped projection (40)
extends at an angle of between about 15 degrees and about 25 degrees from the handle

axis.
The medical device of either claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the projection
(40) is adjacent to the top of the activation latch (34) for engagement with the outside of

the hub (22).
The medical device of any of claims 1 through 4 wherein the projection
(40) is adjacent to the bottom of the activation latch (34) for engagement with the inside

of the hub (22). 
The medical device of claim 1 further comprising a spring (39) extending
between the hub (33) and the distal end of the handle.
The medical device of claims 7 further comprising a needle (32)
mounted to the carrier wherein the activation latch (34) has a top and a bottom and is

moveably mounted adjacent to the distal end of the handle, and wherein the activation
latch (34) is adapted to hold the carrier adjacent to the distal end of the handle against

the bias of the spring (39) when the activation latch (34) engaged to the carrier, such
that the needle (32) extends beyond the distal end of the handle.
The medical device of claim 8 further comprising a hollow catheter (20)
mounted to the hub (33) wherein, when the activation latch (34) engaged to the carrier,

the needle (32) extends through the catheter (20).
