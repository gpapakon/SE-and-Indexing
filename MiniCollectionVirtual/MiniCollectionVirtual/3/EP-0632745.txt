<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for dosing and in particular for mixing substances, in particular for mixing at least one granulated or powdery solid with a liquid. A first substance, in particular the granulated or powdery solid, is fluidized with a continuously or intermittently supplied gas and then this homogenized gas-substance mixture is brought together and mixed in time-constant doses with a second substance. In order to dose the homogenized gas-substance mixture, gas is additionally supplied thereto before it is mixed with the second substance. Said gas is supplied so as to flow parallel to and surround the stream of gas-solids that flows into the mixing device.

Process for mixing granular or powdery substances with at
least one liquid, wherein, by use of a dosing fluidised bed,

the granular or powdery substances are drawn off from the base
region of the fluidised bed and then, in the form of a

homogenised gas/substance mixture, are dosed to the at least
one liquid, and mixed with the latter in a mixing device.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
liquid is sprayed into the homogenised gas/substance mixture.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, for dosing the homogenised gas/substance

mixture, gas is additionally supplied to the latter prior to
mixing with the at least one liquid, this gas being supplied to

the flow of gas/substance mixture flowing to the mixing device
so as to surround it and optionally parallel to its direction

of flow, and in that the velocity of the additionally supplied
gas surrounding the flow of gas/substance mixture is preferably

provided to be of like magnitude as the velocity of the flow of
gas/substance mixture.
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to
claim 1, provided with a fluidised bed installation (1), having

at least one inlet and at least one outlet, having a gas
permeable fluidising base, e.g. a perforated base, for

producing a two phase mixture of a granular or powdery solids
substance with a gas supplied over the fluidising base,

characterised in that the at least one outlet (3) of the
fluidised bed installation (1) is adjoined to the fluidising

base (11) and opens in the region of the latter, in that an
output conduit (4) is provided at the outlet (3) which opens

into a mixing device (18), to which can also be supplied the at
least one liquid, preferably by way of spray nozzles or the

like.
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that a
measuring device is provided for measuring the solids substance

content of the gas/substance mixture, especially in the
fluidised bed installation (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that
a nozzle device (28) is provided at the outlet (3) of the

fluidised bed installation (1) or in the region of the output
conduit (4), preferably formed as a hollow body (5), the nozzle

device (28) being provided as a dosing device, especially for
the mixing action, and having channels (10) for bringing in

additional gas by way of a porous wall (7), nozzles or the like
of the hollow body (5), in or to the homogeneous gas/substance

mixture.
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 6, characterised
in that, for measuring the substance content of the fluidised

gas/substance mixture, the fluidised bed installation (1) and
the nozzle device (28) are equipped with measuring

locations (12a to 12f'), arranged spaced apart if appropriate,
with preferably electrical or electronic pressure measuring

devices or level detectors, whose output signals are fed to an,
e.g. memory programmable, electronic control (34) whose output

signals are fed preferably for the control of valves (13, 13'),
especially directional control valves and/or pressure control

valves, and preferably for the control of a conveying
device (21) for the supply of at least one substance into the

fluidised bed installation (1) and/or into a mixing device.
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 7, characterised
in that the fluidised bed installation (1) can be subjected to

gas pressure, especially pre settable gas pressure, by way of a
valve (35) controllable by the control (34).
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 8, characterised
in that a liquid regulating circuit (34, 40, 41) is provided,

and that the latter can be regulated, preferably by the control
or regulating circuit (34) connected to the respective pressure

gauge (12-12f) on the fluidised bed installation (1).
