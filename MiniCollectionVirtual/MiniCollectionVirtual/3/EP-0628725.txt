<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the invention, for the case of shafts supported in a plain bearing and lubricated by the flow medium, to recirculate the lubricating medium into the low-pressure-side main delivery stream with as a low a flow resistance as possible. This object is achieved by having recessed into or at the bearing body (7', 7'') at least one recirculating duct (return duct) (71a-71d), in such a way that the lubricating medium, as it escapes from the plain bearing on the side facing away from the delivery chamber, seen in an axial direction, can flow back by a minimal flow path. This makes it possible to keep the pressure downstream of the plain bearing at a minimum while nevertheless maintaining a lubricating medium return flow, which in turn reduces, particularly in the case of shafts run through to the outside, the demands made on their seals with respect to the pump's environment.
