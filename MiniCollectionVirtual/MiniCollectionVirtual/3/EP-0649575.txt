<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an electric motor drive with overload protection for the electric motor (10) which receives input (18) predetermining a reference position for a moving part. When the overload protection responds, the reference position is altered to a predeterminable position of rest of the moving part which that moving part assumes before the electric motor (10) is switched off. Besides thermal damage to the electric motor (10), the electric motor drive of the invention prevents the occurrence of consequential damage which can arise from the fact that the part moved by the electric motor drive can assume an undefined position when the electric motor (10) is overloaded.
