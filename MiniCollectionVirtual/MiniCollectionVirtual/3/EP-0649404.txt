<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
mercaptan terminated polymers. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to synthesis of low viscosity 
polymeric polythiols and their use in compositions (and 
methods) for decreasing the viscosity of polymer 
formulations without the use of plasticizers or volatile 
organic components which decrease the viscosity at a 
cost to the final properties and are environmentally 
unacceptable. Mercaptan terminated polymers are widely used in 
sealant, adhesive and coating compositions where quick 
or low temperature cures are needed. The polythioethers 
and polysulfides among this group also have good fuel, 
solvent, water and temperature resistance. Exemplary 
polymers within this group are described in United 
States Patent Nos. 3,923,748; 4,355,307; 3,640,965; 
4,425,389; 4,689,395 and 4,609,762. The sealants, adhesives and coatings which contain 
these mercaptan terminated polymers are applied to 
surfaces as flowable liquids. In general, mercaptan 
terminated polymers have relatively high viscosities 
which make them difficult to formulate into viable 
finished products. One method for reducing the 
viscosity of the polymer compositions involves adding 
various volatile organic solvents to these compositions. 
Although the use of volatile diluents provides 
sufficient reduction in polymer viscosity, which results 
in easy to apply compositions, there are a number of 
drawbacks associated with the use of such volatile 
components. For example, the volatile diluents 
evaporate during the curing process and cause shrinking  
 
of sealant, adhesive or coating. In addition, the 
evaporating volatile components must be contained and 
dealt with in accordance with increasingly strict 
environmental regulations. Another approach for providing flowable mercaptan 
terminated polymer sealants involves the use of 
plasticizers. Plasticizers eliminate shrinking problems 
because they do not evaporate from the polymer during 
the curing process. However, the plasticizer which 
remains in the cured sealant causes the sealant to have 
lower hardness and lower modulus. In many cases limited 
compatability of plasticizer and polymer results in slow 
phase separation leading to cracks in the applied 
materials. Blending of plasticizers also results in 
dirt collection at the surface of the applied 
compositions. The problems associated with the use of volatile 
diluents and plasticizers become even more evident when 
compositions having increased hardness are desired.
