<ABSTRACT>
The method for the automatic acquisition and recognition of scripts, using software-controlled reading devices is especially suitable for the acquisition and recognition of handwritten entries and/or machine scripts on receipts and forms, that is to say a mixture of various types of script. The electronic receipt images acquired by means of a special camera device are fed to readers I, II (to N), which operate respectively with different recognition methods, that is to say they have differently optimised reading properties. Characters not recognised by one reader are recognised by the other reader. A correct data set can be generated automatically. If characters are recognised as correct in reader I but are substituted in reader II, this recognition discrepancy leads to a forced checking and correction. Manual processing is significantly reduced by means of this improvement of recognition and undiscovered substitutions are largely prevented.

<CLAIMS>
Method for automatically acquiring a number of
characters arranged on a receipt, especially characters

applied by hand, comprising the step of carrying out a
comparison step for each of the characters, in which


(a) if at least two script recognition methods have
recognized the character and are in agreement,

the character recognized is output, and
(b) if one of the script recognition methods has
not recognized the character and another of the

script recognition methods has recognized the
character, the character recognized is output,

characterized by the following further steps:

(1) producing an electronic image of the receipt,
(2) subjecting the image to at least two script
recognition methods of different types, each of

the script recognition methods being provided
for the purpose of recognizing each character

of the number of characters in the electronic
image,
(3) if the script recognition methods do not
recognize the character or recognize it as

different characters, carrying out one or more
of the following method steps, depending on the

recognition situation:

(i) subjecting this character to a further
recognition method, which takes into

account a number of characters in a 
sequence and, in the event of recognition,

outputs the character recognized,
(ii) that character is output which has the
higher probability of occurrence between

adjacent and already recognized characters
in the electronic image,
(iii) depending on characters already
recognized and on the type of script,

selecting a predetermined one of the script
recognition methods and outputting the

character recognized by the selected script
recognition method,
(iv) if the character is recognized as
different characters, outputting that

character which, together with characters
which are arranged in a predetermined first

area of the electronic image, are adjacent
to the former character and have already

been recognized, has an information content
which is consistent with an information

content of characters which are arranged in
a second predetermined area of the

electronic image, this area being different
from the first predetermined area, and have

already been recognized, and
(4) otherwise, an operator performing a correction
to the characters involved.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that at least two of the script recognition methods are

each optimized to recognize a predetermined type of

script, these types of script being different from one
another.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that at least two of the script recognition methods

are each optimized to recognize a predetermined type of
script which is used in a predetermined area, these

predetermined areas being different from one another.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the number of script recognition 

methods corresponds to the number of types of script to
be used on the receipt.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the further script recognition

method carries out the recognition of the character to
be output with the aid of algorithms and/or data

matching using lists or dictionaries.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the knowledge relating to the

individual writing styles of a respective customer is
stored in tables in a computer integrated into the

interpretation method.
Device for automatically acquiring a number of
characters arranged on a receipt, especially characters

applied by hand, the device being designed to carry out
all the method steps according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that it has a document processing
station in which at least two reading stations (I, II

... N) of different script recognition methods are
provided, through which stations each electronic

receipt image passes.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the reading stations (I, II) are connected in

parallel.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the reading stations (I, II) are connected one

after another.
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that the reading stations are equipped

for the recognition of general-purpose script,
handwritten block-capital and/or machine scripts.
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 10,
characterized in that the methods of the reading

stations are co-ordinated with one another in such a
way that they are each optimized for the recognition of

a different type of script and/or individual areas
within the different type of script.
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 11,
characterized in that at least one correction station 

is provided and is formed by a software-controlled
computer.
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 12,
characterized in that a sequence of handwritten letters

and/or numbers is stored in the mechanical correction
station (27) and is used to establish handwriting

comparison data for future events.
