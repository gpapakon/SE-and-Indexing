<ABSTRACT>
A scroll type machine (10, 214) is disclosed which incorporates an improved mounting arrangement for the non-orbiting scroll member (64, 226) which mounting arrangement greatly facilitates manufacturing and assembly, effectively prevents radial displacement of the non-orbiting scroll member, and offers the advantages of axial compliance. In one embodiment, the non-orbiting scroll is axially movably secured to a bearing housing (24) by means of a plurality of bolts (92, 102) or bolts (82, 98) and sleeves (78, 94). In another embodiment a rigid annular ring (106) serves to axially movably secure the non-orbiting scroll to the bearing housing while in a third embodiment a stamped ring (170) is secured to both the non-orbiting scroll and the bearing housing. In another embodiment a two piece main bearing housing (242, 244) includes an integral ring (158) for radially positioning the non-orbiting scroll member and means for securing anti-rotation (282) and axial stop means (278) thereto. In  yet another embodiment, a bayonet-type (334, 338) axially compliant mounting arrangement is provided for the non-orbiting scroll which provides integral stop means. Additionally, notches (354) may be provided to isolate the mounting flanges (348) of the two piece main bearing (330) from the integral guide ring (332) to avoid possible distortion thereof. A method of assembling and/or testing the compressor is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to scroll machines and more
specifically to an improved axially compliant mounting arrangement for scroll type
compressors and an arrangement for assembling the components thereof together
which greatly facilitates the assembly thereof as well as enables testing of the
compressor prior to installation of the compressor in the outer shell.A unique axially compliant mounting arrangement is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No.
4,767,293. One embodiment of this mounting arrangement utilizes an elongated
leaf spring strap having opposite ends secured to a flange portion provided on the
non-orbiting scroll member. The center portion of this strap is secured to a pair of
upstanding spaced posts provided on the main bearing housing. A stop flange is
provided on the non-orbiting scroll which engages the lower surface of the strap to
limit axial movement of the non-orbiting scroll member away from the orbiting scroll. 
A retainer overlies the center portion of the strap and serves as a backup to aid in
limiting this axial separating movement of the non-rotating scroll. While this
mounting arrangement offers excellent performance and durability characteristics,
it requires a substantial number of components which render it rather costly in terms
of both manufacturing and assembly time and material. U.S. Patent No. 5,102,316, filed 1st October 1990 and
published 7th April 1992, discloses the embodiments of
apparatus illustrated in Figures 1-20 of the present
application.U.S. Patent No. 5,088,906 discloses a scroll-type
compressor including a fixed scroll frame, a fixed scroll
plate and a connecting pin coupling the plate and frame
together in a manner permitting axial separation. The
compressor also comprises an orbiting scroll plate, a drive
plate and a connecting pin coupling the orbiting plate and
drive plate together in a manner permitting axial
separation. The fixed and orbiting scroll assemblies are
forced axially toward one another by exposure of their back
surfaces to a combination of refrigerant and suction
pressure and refrigerant and oil at discharge pressure.According to the present invention there is provided
a scroll-type machine comprising:
a first scroll member including a first end plate
having a first sealing surface thereon, a first spiral wrap
disposed on said first sealing surface and a first radially
facing abutment surface;a second scroll member including a second end plate
having a second sealing surface thereon and a second spiral
wrap disposed on said second
