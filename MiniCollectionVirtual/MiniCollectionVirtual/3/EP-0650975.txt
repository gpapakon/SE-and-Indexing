<ABSTRACT>
A method for regeneration of denatured proteins by 
refolding of said denatured proteins by reacting said 

denatured proteins and one number selected from the group 

composed of 1 ○ chaperonin 60 monomer, 2 ○ chaperonin 60 
monomer fragment which starts from threonine at 79th 

position from N-terminal of said chaperon 60 monomer and 
having a molecular weight of approximately 50 kD, 3 ○ 

chaperonin 60 monomer and chaperonin 10 and 4 ○ holo-chaperonin. 
The refolding can be carried out without the addition of a 
high energy compound such as ATP and by merely adding one of 

the above mentioned proteins 1 ○ through 4 ○ in the reaction 
system. 
Inactivated proteins forming inclusion bodies in 
transformants or chemically inactivated proteins can be 

regenerated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for the refolding of 
denatured proteins using chaperonin 60 monomer and related 
substances thereof to regenerate the denatured proteins. The present invention concerns chaperonin 60 monomer and 
related substances thereof which provide regenerating agents 
for denatured proteins by supporting and refolding them. This invention can be applied for the regeneration and reactivation 
of chemically denatured inactive proteins and 
inactive proteins cumulated in transformants used in gene 
technology. Numerous types of proteins have been expressed and 
produced by gene technology procedures using host cells 
(transformants) such as Escherichia coli, yeasts or mammal 
derived cells. For example, E. coli can be transformed with a gene coding 
for a protein having human derived physiological activity. 
Then, the transformed E. coli is cultured to express the 
target protein in the cultured cells. However, a large 
amount of cumulated protein in the cells becomes inactive by  
 
the formation of inclusion bodies, thus refolding of the 
inactive protein is required to give the target active 
protein. Therefore, up to now the expressed proteins have 
been denatured with a potent denaturing agent, such as 
guanidine hydrochloride, followed by refolding by dilution 
with a large amount of a diluent to reduce the concentration 
of the denaturing agent. However, the method resulted in a 
poor refolding rate and was liable to give differently bound 
thiol (-SH) groups. Thus, the method cannot always give the 
identical structure to that of the target active protein and 
is laborious. Therefore, production of the desired protein 
using E. coli has been limited to a few proteins such as 
growth hormones although the process is cost effective. A new protein called a "molecular chaperon" which 
participates in the refolding of inactive protein was 
recently found. A molecular chaperon is defined as "a 
protein molecule which helps correct folding and aggregation 
of polypeptides but is not included in the final component 
of protein" by Ellis, J., (Nature, 328, 378-379 (1987)). 
Taguchi et al. (Biophysics, 33(1) 11-14 (1993)) stated that 
a molecular chaperon is required for steps wherein the 
conformational coupling of protein varies greatly such as 
the synthesis of proteins, folding of newly synthesized 
polypeptide chains, permeation of various membranes, heat 
shocks and degradation of proteins at the alteration of 
generation. In other words, a molecular chaperon is  
 
indispensab
