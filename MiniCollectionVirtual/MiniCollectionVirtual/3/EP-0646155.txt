<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the improvement of rubber-to-metal adhesion and adhesion retention in sulfur vulcanizable, metal reinforced rubber compositions via the use of substituted pyrimidine and triazine adhesion promoters of structure (I), wherein A is N or C-H, X, Y and Z are independently selected from the group consisting of chloro, (II) wherein R1 may be hydrogen, chloro, acyl, or C1-C12 alkyl; R2 may be hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl, chloro, hydroxy, alkoxy, or anilino; R3 may be hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or phenyl; R4 may be hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl, cyclohexyl, C1-C12 hydroxyalkyl, or C1-C12 alkoxyalkyl; R5 may be hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, cyclohexyl, or C1-C12 hydroxyalkyl; with the proviso that Z may not be chloro when both X and Y are chloro.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITUTED PYRIMIDINES AND SUBSTITUTED TRIAZINES AS RUBBER-TO-METAL ADHESION PROMOTERSTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is directed toward improving the adhesion and adhesion retention between rubber compositions, such as those used in the manufacture of tires, conveyor belts, hoses and the like and brass coated wire or cable which is embedded in the stock. The improved useful life of modern rubber composi¬ tions, especially in belting and tire end uses via more sophisticated and effective antiozonant/antioxidant packages have necessitated the desirability of adding materials to the rubber compositions to improve useful article life and service through increased reinforcing agent adhesion and adhesion retention. Improved adhesion between rubber and brass coated wire is obtained according to the present invention.BACKGROUND ART It is often desirable to reinforce rubber articles by incorporating therein metal reinforcing elements. For example, tires, conveyor belts, power transmission belts, timing belts, hoses and a variety of other rubber articles are often reinforced with metal wire. In order for rubber articles which are provided with steel 

reinforcing elemen to function effectively, it is important that good adhesion between the rubber and the metal reinforcing elements be maintained. One of the most common methods of enhancing the adhesion of wire filaments to rubber is to coat the filament with another material, for example, pneumatic vehicle tires are often reinforced with cords prepared from steel filaments which are coated with brass. Normally, steel reinforcing elements are coated with a brass that is an alloy of copper and zinc.It is also known that various agents can be mixed into the rubber which will increase adhesion between the rubber and metal reinforcements embedded in it. U.S. Patent No. 3,894,903 discloses a process for improving the bonding of rubber to copper and copper alloys by incorporating into the rubber before vulc?- .zation certain triazines, for example 2-(3-hydroxJ
 4-chloro-6-aminotriazine.Peroxide initiated curing systems for rubbery ate- rials have proven to be unsatisfactory in the production of finished articles that are required to have extended flex life, for peroxide cured rubbers tend to crack when subject to repeated flexing. Additionally, peroxide curing systems tend to be expensive and because of their reactivity, they require careful handling to avoid the creation of a dangerous environment.As a result, many industries, such as the tire and industrial
