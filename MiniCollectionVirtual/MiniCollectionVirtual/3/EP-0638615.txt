<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a copper phthalocyanine pigment. More
specifically, it relates to a process for the production of
a copper phthalocyanine pigment, which comprises wet-milling
crude copper phthalocyanine in the co-presence of a
phthalocyanine derivative, an inorganic salt and an organic
liquid. Further, the present invention relates to a
printing ink (gravure ink or offset ink) or a coating
composition, which has excellent fluidity and excellent
gloss and which comprises a copper phthalocyanine pigment
obtained by the above process and a vehicle for a printing
ink or a vehicle for a coating composition.Finely milled copper phthalocyanine pigments are
widely used in large amounts in the industrial field of
coloring materials owing to their fine color tones, high
tinting strength and excellent properties in weatherability
and heat resistance.Generally, crude copper phthalocyanine is produced
by reacting phthalic anhydride or its derivative, urea and a
copper source, or reacting phthalodinitrile or its
derivative and a copper source, in the presence or absence
of a catalyst such as ammonium molybdate or titanium
tetrachloride in an organic solvent such as alkylbenzene,
trichlorobenzene or nitrobenzene under atmospheric pressure
or elevated pressure. During the synthesis of crude copper
phthalocyanine, however, synthesized phthalocyanine
molecules undergo crystal growth one after another in a 
synthesis solvent, and it is obtained only in the form of
coarse needle-like particles having a major diameter of
about 10 to 200 µm. As a consequence, the so-synthesized
crude copper phthalocyanine has little or no value as a
pigment for coloring an ink, a coating composition and
plastics.Therefore, the above crude copper phthalocyanine
is required to be finely milled so that it is converted to
particles having high coloring usefulness, i.e., having a
particle diameter of approximately 0.01 to 0.5 µm.For industrially finely milling crude copper
phthalocyanine, JP-A-51-28119 typically discloses a so-called
solvent-salt milling method in which crude copper
phthalocyanine is charged into a double-armed dispersing
mixer together with a water-soluble inorganic salt as a
milling aid such as sodium chloride and an organic liquid
such as an alcohol, a polyol or an amine, and wet-milled.
The copper phthalocyanine pigment obtained by the above
method has fine particles, and mostly exhibits a high
viscosity when dispersed in a vehicle for a gravure ink or a
coating composition. It
