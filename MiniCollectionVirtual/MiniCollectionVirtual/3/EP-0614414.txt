<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and process for the manufacture of paint rollers, wherein in said apparatus cylindrical tubular matrix rods (10) are automatically, individually and sequentially carried throughout the apparatus and rotatively driven, in order to receive a covering strip (812), which is helically applied onto the heated surface of each matrix rod (10). The apparatus allows the covering to be automatically and continuously processed along the matrix rods (10), which are sequentially fed. Upon the completion of the covering of each matrix rod (10), said rod is separated from the immediately anterior rod, through the automatic cut of the covering at the junction point of both rods, said rod being then released from said apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an apparatus and a 
process for the manufacture of paint rollers, which 
provide, automatically, the covering of a cylindrical 
tubular rod with a fibrous material that externally 
carries a layer or web made of animal, vegetal of 
synthetic fibers. In one of the known processes for the manufacture of 
paint rollers (DE-A-35 44 640), the feeding, conducting 
and removing operations of the processed material are 
made through stages, requiring the paralyzation of the 
apparatus whenever a matrix tubular rod, presenting a 
length corresponding to a plurality of rollers, passes 
through the rolling stage of the manufacturing process, 
and when, after it has been removed from said 
apparatus, a new matrix rod is positioned, in order to 
be covered by said apparatus. This process, apart from not being continuous, requires 
a great deal of interference from the operators, thus 
becoming very slow. Another inconvenience refers to the 
inevitable loss of the covering material at the ends of 
each rod, since the beginning and the end of the 
winding should occur with the strip of the covering 
material being slightly projected beyond the end limits 
of the rod. US-A-2,812,007 describes a process for the manufacture 
of paint rollers, in which a semi-automatic apparatus 
is used, which operates continuously but requires the 
matrix rods to be fed and removed manually and a 
tensioning clamp in a rod cover material strip feed to 
be continuously adjusted by an operator in order to 
control the strip width where it is laid on the core to  
 
ensure the facing margins of adjacent layers of the 
spirally wound covering strip to be in perfect abutment 
so that there are no gaps in the coverage of the core 
and be no overlapping of adjacent layers. Although the 
matrix rods are continuously covered in a relatively 
short time and without interruption of the rod covering 
process during operation of said apparatus, a 
relatively great deal of interference by the operator 
is still required. A more recent process for the manufacture of paint 
rollers (published Brazilian patent application No. PI 
8602712), presents a semi-automatic apparatus of 
continuous operation, in which the matrix rods are 
manually fed and removed from said apparatus, but 
without interrupting the rod covering process during 
the working period of said apparatus. In this 
apparatus, a system for supporting a central guide of 
the rod and having carriages is mounted onto a basic 
structure, in which a first carriage
