<ABSTRACT>
The pulse rate monitor is arranged by employing pulse wave component 
extracting means for extracting pulse wave components from frequency-analyzing results 

of a pulse wave sensor (301) which senses the pulse of a body and an action noise sensor 
(302) which senses movement of the body and pulse rate calculating means for 

calculating a pulse rate per 1 minute from the pulse wave components extracted from 
data from the pulse wave (301) and action noise sensor (302) by the pulse wave 

component extracting means, so that the pulse rate is displayed (313). Furthermore, 
there is employed an action noise signal confirming means (304,307) for judging whether 

or not an action noise is present, and also calculation changing means for changing a 
calculation method of the pulse rate based on the output signal from the action noise 

signal confirming means. As a result, the amount of calculation is reduced and power 
consumption is suppressed, so that calculation time can be shortened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pulse rate monitor mounted on a portion of a
human or other biological body.In many circumstances it is desirable to be provided with an indication of the pulse
rate of a human or other biological body. For example, during exercise, such as running, a
person may wish to monitor their pulse rate in order to obtain an indication of their physical
fitness and/or the vigorousness of the excercise. However, the movement/actions of the
body make it difficult to accurately determine the pulse rate.DE 3150925A discloses an arrangement for pulse measurement, comprising a pulse
wave sensor for detecting a pulse from a biological body and generating a signal indicative
thereof; an interference movement sensor for sensing movement of the body and generating
a signal indicative thereof; and a differential amplifier for subtracting the amplified
movement signals from the amplified pulse signals.Figure 11 is a functional block diagram representing the construction of the
conventional pulse wave detecting apparatus. The pulse wave detecting means 1101 detects
a pulse wave signal, and outputs a detected pulse wave signal to a frequency analyzing
means 1103. The action noise detecting means 1102 detects an action noise signal and
outputs a detected action noise signal to the frequency analyzing means 1103. The display
means 1104 displays the frequency-analyzed result made by the frequency analyzing means
1103. The control means 1105 controls the frequency analyzing means 1103 and the
display means 1104.The above-described pulse wave analyzing apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent No. 60-259239. WO 91/18550 discloses a pulse responsive device comprising a light emitter and
receiver for providing an electrical signal varying in accordance with blood flow pulsations
and a movement transducer for providing an electrical signal representing body movement.
The device cancels out the movement noise from the signal varying in accordance with
blood flow pulsations.However, the conventional pulse rate monitor merely displays both the frequency
analyzed result of the pulse wave sensor and the frequency analyzed result of the action
noise sensor on the output display unit. As a result, either the pulse wave frequency, or the
pulse rate, must be determined by the user by observing the respective result representations
on the output display unit. Also, the same signal processing system is used to determine the
pulse wave frequency-analyzed and action noise frequency-analyzed results
