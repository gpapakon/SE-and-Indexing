<ABSTRACT>
A method of regulating the expression of one or more anthocyanin pigment genes in a plant which comprises the steps of transforming plant tissue with an expression vector comprising a DNA segment encoding a protein having the amino acid sequence of the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 or a protein having an amino acid sequence which shows substantial homology with the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 and which is capable of regulating expression of one or more plant genes involved in pigment biosynthesis, the said DNA segment being under the control of a promoter upstream of and operably linked thereto and regenerating from the transformed tissue plants showing altered anthocyanin pigmentation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REGULATION OF PLANT GENESThis invention relates to the regulation of plant genes, more , particularly the regulation of genes which control the pigmentation of plants.Technological Background.Plant species display remarkable diversity in the pattern and intensity of their pigmentation, in particular red or purple anthocyanin pigmentation. Mutations that block anthocyanin production are viable and have readily observable phenotypes; consequently two classes of genes affecting anthocyanin biosynthesis have been characterised in a range of species including maize, Antirrhinum ma jus , pea and Petunia hybrida (see Coe and Nuffer in Corn and corn improvement , ed. Sprague, 19-53, American Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wisconsin (1977) , Dooner et al, Ann . Rev . Genet . , 25, 173-199 (1992) , Martin et al, Soc . Exp .Biol . Symp . , 3_2., 19-52 (1987) , Harker et al, The PlantCell , 2 , 185-194 (1990) and Gerats and Martin, RecentAdvances in Phytoche istry, H. Stafford, Ed. , (in press) .The genes of one class encode enzymes required for pigment biosynthesis and many of these genes appear to be common to different species (see Martin et al, The Plant Journal , 1 , 37-49 (1991) , Sommer and Saedler, Mol . Gen . Genet . , 202, 429-434 (1986), Coen et al, Cell , AJ_, 285-296 (1986) and Beld et al, Plant Mol . Biol . , Ï‹, 491-502 (1989)) . The other class comprises regulators of the biosynthetic genes (see Almeida et al, Genes Dev . , 3./ 1758- 1767 (1989) , Harker et al ibid , Dooner and Nelson Genetics, 91, 309-315 (1979) and Beld et al ibid) . This class includes the CI and R genes in maize, which encode products related to the myb and myc families of transcription factors respectively (see Paz-Ares et al, EMBO J . , 6_, 3553- 3558 (1987) and Ludwig et al, Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . 

 U . S .A . , 86.r 7092-7096 (1989)) .The present invention is based on the isolation and characterisation of a gene designated delila. that regulates pigmentation pattern in Antirrhinum ma jus and the use of this gene to regulate the expression of one or more anthocyanin pigment genes in a plant. Wild- ype A. majus flowers have five red petals united to form a corolla tube with five distinct lobes. The epidermal cells of the petals contain red anthocyanin pigments. A recessive delila (del) mutation is known which confers a strikingly different pattern of floral pigmentation in which the corolla tubes are ivory and the lobes fully pigmented. The del mutation also blocks pigmentation of the anther filaments and lower stems and

CLAIMS
1. A method of regulating the expression of one or more anthocyanin pigment genes in a plant which comprises the steps of transforming plant tissue with an expression vector comprising a DNA segment encoding a protein having the amino acid sequence of the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 or a protein having an amino acid sequence which shows substantial homology with the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 and which is capable of regulating expression of one or more plant genes involved in pigment biosynthesis, the said DNA segment being under the control of a promoter upstream of and operably linked thereto and regenerating from the transformed tissue plants showing altered anthocyanin pigmentation.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the plant belongs to the dicotyledoneae.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the DNA segment encoding a protein having the amino acid sequence of the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 is a protein having an amino acid sequence which is at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 98% similar with the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2.
4. A plant having a DNA segment encoding a protein having the amino acid sequence of the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 or a protein having an amino acid sequence which shows substantial homology with the DEL protein as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or 2 incorporated into its genome or plant propagation material of such a plant.
