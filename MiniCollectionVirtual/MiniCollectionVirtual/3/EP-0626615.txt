<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coating composition for 
antistatic layers and to a 
method of preparing such layers for photographic 
elements. U.S. Patent 4,070,189 relates to antistatic 
compositions comprising a highly cross-linked 
vinylbenzyl quaternary ammonium polymer and a 
hydrophobic binder. This patent suggests that since 
the solvent for applying the coating must both disperse 
the antistatic polymer and dissolve the binder, 
mixtures of solvents may be desirable. The preferred 
solvent combination disclosed is acetone/methanol and 
methanol/propylene chloride/2-methoxyethanol. 
Subsequently, it has been found that a mixture of 
acetone, methanol, and methyl chloroform gave 
particularly good results with regard to coating 
latitude and to the elimination of an imperfection 
known as "bloom" which appears as a haze under specular 
lighting. Because of environmental reasons, solvents 
utilizing halogenated hydrocarbons in any degree are 
suspect. Therefore, in order to avoid any question of 
environmental degradation, it is desired to replace the 
methyl chloroform used in the solvent mixture without 
an accompanying degradation to the photographic films. 
This is not a simple task because the methyl chloroform 
in conjunction with the mixture of solvents indicated 
above gives particularly good results for a variety of 
reasons as expressed. Thus, one cannot simply remove 
the methyl chloroform from the solvent formulation or  
 
substitute any known solvent in its place and expect to 
achieve substantially the same results. This invention provides 
a coating composition for applying an antistatic layer to a surface as claimed in 
Claim 1 and a method of preparing antistatic layers on a photographic element 
as claimed in Claim 6.  
 While any of the three solvents mentioned 
above may be employed together with acetone and 
methanol in the percentages indicated, it is preferred 
that the group member, i.e., n-propyl acetate, 1-methoxy-2-propanol 
or cyclohexane be employed in an 
amount of from 10 to 25 percent by weight 
based on the total weight of the solvent mixture and 
for best results the group member be employed in an 
amount of from 12 to 20 percent by weight. It 
has been found that these particular mixtures of 
solvents when employed for applying the antistatic 
layer compositions in accordance with this invention 
produce excellent results with regard to bloom, 
conductivity, friction characteristics and scratch 
susceptibility. Of the three, n-propyl acetate is most 
preferred.
