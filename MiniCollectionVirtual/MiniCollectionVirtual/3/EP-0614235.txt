<ABSTRACT>
The structure according to the invention comprises a coaxial cable (2) encased in a solid stress-distribution part (1), produced from an elastically deformable material and designed so that a force (F) exerted at any point of the part (1) has an impact over a relatively large region (Z) of the surface of a cable (2), and that the cable (2) substantially recovers its initial position as soon as the force which has caused its deformation ceases. The invention applies particularly to the detection and/or the location of objects or persons in a defined detection area.
