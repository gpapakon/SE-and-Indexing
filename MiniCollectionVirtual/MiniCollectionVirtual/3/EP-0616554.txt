<DESCRIPTION>
CATALYST TREATMENT PROCESS.This invention relates to a process for the reactivation of a deactivated chromium based fluorination catalyst and to a process for the production of hydrofluorocarbons by the fluorination of hydrocarbons or hydrohalocarbons , in particular a process for the production of 1 , 1 , 1 , 2- etrafluoroethane by the fluorination of l-chloro-2 , 2 , 2-tetrafluoroethane with hydrogen fluoride, _n the presence of a reactivated chromium based fluorination catalyst.The production of fluorinated hydrocarbons, which may also contain halogen atoms other than fluorine, by the catalysed vapour-phase fluorination of hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons with hydrogen fluoride is well known and numerous catalysts have been proposed for use in such processes. Catalysts comprising or based upon chromium are frequently employed in these known processes. The chromium based catalyst may for example be chromium oxide, commonly known as chromia, or it may be a halogenated chromia, for example a chromium fluoride or oxyfluoride. Furthermore, these chromium based catalysts may also comprise amounts of other species which are present in order to promote the activity of the catalyst, for example the chromium based catalyst may also comprise activaty promoting amounts of zinc, nickel, cobalt or other metals.As examples of vapour phase fluorination processes in which chromium based catalysts are employed may be mentioned inter alia, the reaction of trichloroethylene with hydrogen fluoride to produce l-chloro-2 , 2, 2-trifluoroethane as described in GB 1,307,224, the reaction of l-chloro-2 , 2 , 2-trifluoroethane with hydrogen fluoride to produce 1 , 1 , 1 , 2-tetrafluoroethane as described in GB 1,589,924 and the fluorination of chlorodifluoroethylene tc l-chloro-2 , 2 , 2-trifluoroethane as is also described for the removal of chlorodifluoroethylene impurity from 1 , 1 , 1 , 2-tetrafluoroethane in GB 1.589,924- 

 The use of such catalysts in these processes does however suffer from the problem that the catalyst is deactivated with time so that the activity of the catalyst, reflected in the reactant conversion, and selectivity of the catalyst, decrease gradually with time. The loss in activity may be reduced to a certain extent by steadily increasing the temperature at which the reaction is carried out. However, such increase in temperature leads inevitably to a consequential decrease in the selectivity of the process. It is conventional practice for the catalyst to be periodically "re-activated" or
