<ABSTRACT>
For the continuous measurement of the air permeability on moving or stationary product webs (B), these are guided over a measuring aperture (9) which opens at the end of a measuring pipe (8) into the convex curved outer surface of a measuring head (5). This convex curved surface deflects the web (B). By means of the tension in the web material, the web (B) is thereby automatically wrapped around the measuring aperture (9) in a sealing fashion on this surface. In the measuring pipe (9), air is sucked by means of a pump (10) through the portion of the web lying over the measuring aperture (9). The flow speed of the air sucked through the test specimen is measured in a flowmeter (15) and is indicated as air permeability of the test specimen by an indicator device (16) and, if necessary, used for control.
