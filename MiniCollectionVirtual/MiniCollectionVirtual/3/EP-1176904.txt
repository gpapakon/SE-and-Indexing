<DESCRIPTION>
 PHYSIOLOGICAL SENSOR ARRAYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a physiological sensor device or sensor array for attachment to a mammalian subject in order to obtain data about one or more physiological parameters of the subject. In particular, the invention relates to a physiological sensor device in the form of a patch attachable to the chest of a human subject to enable sensing of physiological data such as electro-cardiographic data and/or respiration data.Description of the Prior ArtThe prior art includes US 3,943,918 to Lewis which discloses an ECG signal sensing and transmitting device for use in the care of medical patients requiring monitoring of cardiac functions. The device disclosed is a single use, disposable unit consisting principally of a foam pad having a pair of circular electrodes in one face of the rectangular foam block. The block comprises electrical circuitry which transmits an RF signal to a receiver which is required to be within 100 feet of the patient. Subsequent filtering and amplification of the signal takes place at a monitoring station comprising a receiver and the like. The device is disposable after one use but, as a result, is somewhat crude and only comprises two electrodes for very basic ECG measurements. US 4,121,573 discloses a chest sensor for monitoring cardiac rhythms of a patient using a pair of spaced circular electrodes mounted on a foam pad. Electrical 

connectors between the electrodes and electronic circuitry for acquiring and transmitting cardiac rhythm signals is provided by independent electrical leads or wires. The circuitry and wires are located on the rear surface of a first layer of foam and held in position by a second layer of foam. Accordingly, a fairly deep configuration of layers of foam, electronic circuitry and electrodes is provided in this rather crude two electrode device. US 4,957,109 discloses an electrode array for use in generating electrocardiographic signals for a patient. The array comprises ten different electrode regions (comprising pairs of semicircular electrodes) for attachment to different parts of the human body. The electrodes are interconnected to an output connector for attachment to signal processing apparatus. The electrode sensors and electrical conductors between the electrodes and the output conductor are formed on a large flexible circuit board having a large dentritic or tree-like configuration to enable location of the electrodes at appropriate positions on the human
