<ABSTRACT>
Tape units having a 
plurality of kinds of tapes, to be reloaded to corresponding 

tape cassettes, and when the tape unit is to be reloaded, the 
kind of tape unit to be reloaded can be discriminated at a single 

glance and the tape unit can be reloaded in a proper state to the 
corresponding tape cassette without fail. 
A cap (30) is fitted in a spool hole (24) disposed on the upper 
end part of a tape spool (23) of each tape unit, and there is a 

display for displaying the ground color of a tape (103), a color 
which can be colored in printing, the use of the tape (103) and the 

width of the tape (103) provided on the upper surface of the cap 
(30). Thus, the characteristic of each tape can be recognized at a 

single glance, and reloading can be performed properly in 
selecting a desired tape unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape unit to be housed 
in a tape cassette to be applied to a tape printer for 
manufacturing a tape with characters which is used being affixed 
on the back of a video cassette, etc., in particular, it relates 
to a tape unit which is reloadable on a tape cassette and which 
can be properly reloaded on a tape cassette main body without 
mistaking a tape unit to be reloaded for a wrong one in the case 
of reloading of a tape unit. The invention further relates to a 
tape printer comprising such a tape unit. Concerning tape cassettes to be used for a tape printer, it 
is desirable to use different tapes having different tape widths 
or tape colors. Therefore, a plurality of kinds of tape cassettes 
have been prepared corresponding to the tapes having a plurality 
of kinds of tape widths or tape colors. Tapes to be housed in 
tape cassettes are wound in roll shapes, respectively. A tape 
has a lamination structure of four layers: a thermosensible 
agent layer which can be colored by the heat of a thermal head is 
formed on a surface of a tape base and on the other surface of the 
tape base, a releasable paper is placed through an adhesive agent 
layer. In order to manufacture a tape with characters using such 
a tape, a part of the roll-shaped tape is pulled out till it 
reaches a thermal head. Heat control is performed selectively by 
the thermal head on the side of the thermosensible agent layer 
and a tape with characters is manufactured, the tape which has 
characters, etc. formed by coloring on the thermosensible agent 
layer. In the case of such conventional tape cassettes, no 
consideration is given to the rehousing of a new tape to a 
cassette case when a tape is used up and, therefore, when a housed 
tape is used up, the cassette case itself loses its use value and 
is discarded. Thereupon, it can be considered to form a tape spool for a 
tape cassette and a tape wound on it into one unit and to arrange 
the unit to be exchangeable for a tape cassette main body. 
Hereinafter, a unit composed of a tape spool and a tape wound  
 
around it will be called a tape unit. A plurality of kinds of 
tape units are prepared by the use objects. A tape unit has a simple structure, and it is an 
indispensable condition that a tape unit can be interchangeable 
with another tape unit for the identical tape cassette, so that 
all tape units have to have similar shapes; therefore, it has 
been difficult to discriminate a desired tape unit out of a 
plurality of tape units. Since
