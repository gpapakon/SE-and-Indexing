<ABSTRACT>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an
agent system in which it will not be necessary to respecify

the destination and in which the dead time entails in
specifying the destination will be minimized. Agent

generating unit in the system agent generates mobile object
with its attached routing list which indicates the object's

destination. MPU converting unit converts agent to MPU code.
Intermediate code converting unit changes to intermediate

code, and outputs to the next communication device. In the
communication device which received the agent, the MPU

converting unit converts the agent to MPU code. Agent
restoring unit restores the agent of MPU code to the original

agent, and stores it in the memory area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an agent system in which an agent
generated by an agent server is moved consecutively among
communication devices via communication lines.A typical agent system of the type which has recently
been proliferating is shown in Figure 14. Agent server 50,
various communication devices 60 (personal computers, work
stations, etc.) and storage device 80, which stores a program
to generate agents, are all connected via cable line 90 (or,
although not pictured, they may be connected cordlessly).
This line is used to transfer agent 70, which we shall discuss
shortly, from one device to the next.In such an agent system, agent server 50 generates, based
on a source program, an agent 70 consisting of object code.
The agent 70 which has been generated is transmitted to a
designated communication device 60, where the system agent 601
for that device 60 executes it.Agent systems of the sort described above use two methods
to transmit an agent 70. In one method, the agent is given
its destination and target processing but not the route by
which it is to reach the destination. In the other method,
the agent is given only its target processing and does not
receive either its destination or its transmission route.We shall now discuss these two methods for transmitting
an agent, with reference to the flow charts in Figures 15 and
16. Method 1: Agent is given destination and target
processing.Agent server 50 uses a source program which executes
specific processing stored in storage device 80 to generate
object code. It also generates an agent by assigning a
destination to this object code to indicate where it is to go
(Step 510), and it sends this agent 70 to its destination.Agent 70 travels along line 90 to whichever communication
device 60 has a node for the specified destination (Step 520).
It is taken in by this device 60, whose system agent 601
executes it.The system agent 601 of this device 60 renders a judgment
as to whether the target processing assigned to agent 70 has
been completed (Step 530). If it determines that the
processing has not been completed (Step 530: N), it returns
the agent to its source, agent server 50.When agent 70 returns to agent server 50, the server
respecifies its destination and target processing (Step 550).
We return to 520, and the processing described above resumes.If system agent 601 determines that the target processing
has been completed (Step 530: Y), agent 70 is sent back to
agent server 50 (Step 540) and the processing is completed.Method 2: The agent is given

An agent system in which an agent server and a number
of communication devices are connected via a communication

line which may be a cable or cordless line, and an agent with
routing data generated by said agent server travels among said

communication devices via said communication line according to
said routing data, wherein said communication device comprises

a restoring and transmitting means to restore and transmit
said agent which can modify said routing data for said agent

which are received and stored in a memory, and which can
restore said agent with a specified set of routing data and

transmit said restored agent.
An agent system in which an agent server and a number
of communication devices are connected via a communication

line which may be a cable or cordless line, and an agent with
routing data generated by said agent server travels among said

a memory area reserving means to reserve a memory area for
said agent in a destining communication device to which said

agent is to be sent according to said routing data.
An agent system in which an agent server and a number
