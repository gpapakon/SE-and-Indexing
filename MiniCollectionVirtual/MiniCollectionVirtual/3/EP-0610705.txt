<ABSTRACT>
This new and practical type of equipment is a special equipment with three grinding heads 
for processing bore of internal spline parts. Clamping a workpiece in one time can finish 

grinding processing operation of bore, spline in bore and one of its end faces. There are 
a grinding head for bore and a grinding head for a side of bore spline installed in main 

sliding plate moving on the vertical shaft of the machine body; a rotary table is installed 
in a removable working table driven by a driving unit. Both the working table and the 

grinding head for the spline end face are located in the body. It has high efficiency, high 
precision and low equipment investment as the time saving for aligning and clamping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new and practical type of
grinder, especially to a combined grinder for internal spline
grinding.The invention is based on Chinese patent CN 88 216 959.5
"Spline Side Grinder for Internal Spline" and realizes an
improvement thereof. According to the general technology that
is used by prior art several mounting and dismounting procedures
are required in order to finish grinding of one particular
workpiece. Mounting and dismounting of the workpiece
is required between any of the grinding steps, i.e.
grinding in bore, grinding an end face, and grinding the side
of internal spline. Such mounting and dismounting results in
low efficiency, high equipment investment, large area requirements,
and unstable quality of the processed parts.An example for grinding internal splines is given by the
publication "Machinery and Production Engineering, vol. 129,
No. 3329, 29. September 1976, pages 383 - 385; A. W. Astrop:
Grinding Internal Splines with a Boron Nitride Wheel". In this
publication it is disclosed how to perform internal spline
grinding in an elaborate manner, by use of a boron nitride
wheel. Due to the described technique it is possible to grind
internal splines to finish size at a single pass. The particular
reason for the achievements of subject publication is related
to the material of the grinding wheel and is further
induced by a special eccentric construction of the workhead 
spindle. However, subject publication neglects the disadvantages
that are related to mounting and dismounting between
several successive grinding steps which are usually required
for finishing manufacture of a workpiece.Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to supply
a grinder for internal spline that makes mounting and dismounting
between successive grinding steps dispensable.Such object is solved by providing a grinding machine that can
finish grinding of a bore, end face grinding and grinding a
side of internal spline by one time clamping the workpiece,
resulting in high quality, high efficiency, and low clamping
deviation.The grinding machine according to the present invention comprises
a machine body, a vertical shaft and a working table
mounted to said machine body, and grinding means. The vertical
shaft comprises main slideways that are carrying a main
sliding plate which is movably mounted to the slideways. A
locking mechanism is installed in the main sliding plate. The
working table of the grinding machine is carrying a rotary
table with clamping means for clamping a

<CLAIMS>
A grinding machine for internal splines composed of a machine body
(1), a vertical shaft (8), and a working table (13) mounted to said machine

body (1) and grinding means (3, 4, 6)

characterized in that

said vertical shaft (8) comprising main slideways, carrying a
main sliding plate (9), movably mounted to said slideways, and

a locking mechanism being installed in said main sliding plate
(9);
said working table (13) carrying a rotary table (2) with clamping
means (5) for clamping a workpiece, a rotating mechanism

(12) for rotating said rotary table (2), and a driving unit
(14), placed at one end of said working table (13), comprising

a hydraulic oil cylinder or a servo motor for driving said
working table (13); and
said grinding means (3, 4, 6) comprising a bore grinding head
(4) and a spline side grinding head (6), mounted to slideways

(7, 11) of said main sliding plate (9) of said vertical shaft
(8), and an end grinding head (3) mounted to said machine body

(1);
said driving unit (14) forcing the working table (13) successively
into three working positions, namely the position of

clamping a workpiece, a position of grinding for a side of
bore spline, and a position of grinding for bore and end face,

thereby allowing all faces to be ground with one clamping.
