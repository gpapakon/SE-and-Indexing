 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING INFECTION USING OPTICALLY PURE (S)-LOMEFLOXACIN1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel compositions of matter containing optically pure (S)-lomefloxacin. These compositions possess potent activity in treating various infections while avoiding adverse effects associated with racemic lomefloxacin including but not limited to headache, stomach discomfort, gastrointestinal disorders, hypoglycemia, renal and hepatic dysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress, and arthropathy, such as cartilage lesions and erosion and abnormalities in bone growth in immature patients. Additionally, these novel compositions of matter containing optically pure (S)-lomefloxacin are useful in treating infection in those patients with impaired renal function. Also disclosed are methods for treating the above-described conditions in a human while avoiding adverse effects that are associated with the racemic mixture of lomefloxacin, by administering the (S)-isomer of lomefloxacin to said human.1.1 Steric Relationship and Drug Action Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e.. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s) . The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is 

 dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers if referred to as a racemic mixture.Stereochemical purity is of importance in the field of pharmaceuticals, where 12 of the 20 most prescribed drugs exhibit chirality. A case in point is provided by the L-form of the jS-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, which is known to be 100 times more potent than the D-enantiomer.Furthermore, optical purity is important since certain isomers may actually be deleterious rather than simply inert. For example, it has been suggested that the D-enantiomer of thalidomide was a safe and effective sedative when prescribed for the control of morning sickness during

What is claimed is:
1. A method of treating infection in a human, which comprises administering to a human, an amount of (S)-lomefloxacin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, substantially free of its (R)-stereoisomer, said amount being sufficient to alleviate infection.
2. A method of treating infection in a human while avoiding the concomitant liability of adverse effects associated with the administration of racemic lomefloxacin, which comprises administering to a human, an amount of (S)-lomefloxacin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, substantially free of its (R)-stereoisomer, said amount being sufficient to alleviate infection, but insufficient to cause said adverse effects associated with administration of racemic lomefloxacin.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein said adverse effects are selected from the group consisting of headache, stomach discomfort, gastrointestinal disorders, arthropathy and abnormalities in bone growth in immature patients.
4. The method of claim 2 wherein said adverse effects are selected from the group consisting of hypoglycemia, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress.
5. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein (S)-lomefloxacin is administered by intravenous infusion, transdermal delivery, orally as a tablet or a capsule.
6. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the amount administered is from about 100 mg to about 800 mg. 


 7. The method of claim 6 wherein the amount administered is from about 100 mg to about 400 mg.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the amount administered is from about 100 mg to about 200 mg.
9. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the amount of (S)-lomefloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is greater than approximately 90% by weight.
10. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the amount of (S)-lomefloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, substantially free of its (R)- stereoisomer is administered together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
11. The method according to claims 5, 6, 7, or 8, wherein (S)-lomefloxacin is administered as a hydrochloride salt.
12. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said infection is selected from the group consisting of urinary tract infections, upper respiratory tract infections, sexually-transmitted infections, ophthalmological infections, and intestinal infections. 13. An antibiotic composition for treating infection in a human, which comprises an amount of (S)-lomefloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, substantially free of its (R)- stereoisomer, said amount being sufficient to alleviate infection, but insufficient to cause adverse effects associated with lomefloxacin.
14. A composition according to claim 13 wherein said adverse effects are selected from the group consisting of headache, stomach discomfort, 


 gastrointestinal disorders, arthropathy and abnormalities in bone growth in immature patients.
15. A composition according to claim 13 wherein said adverse effects are selected from the group consisting of hypoglycemia, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress.
16. A composition according to claim 13 wherein the amount is about 100 mg to about 400 mg. 17. A composition according to claim 13 wherein said composition is administered from one to four times a day.
18. A composition according to claim 17 wherein said composition is administered once a day. 19. A composition according to claim 13 which comprises the hydrochloride salt of (S)- lomefloxacin.
20. A composition according to claim 19 wherein said composition is adapted for oral administration.
21. A composition according to claim 19 adapted for intravenous delivery.
22. A composition according to claim 19 for use in a transdermal formulation. 23. A composition according to claim 22 for use as a transdermal patch.
24. The composition according to claim 13 wherein (S)-lomefloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, substantially free of its (R)- stereoisomer is administered together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
