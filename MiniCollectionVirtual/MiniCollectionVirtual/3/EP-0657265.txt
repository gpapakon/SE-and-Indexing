Process for the production of laminated, dimensionally 
stable formed parts, such as inner linings for motor 

vehicles or similar, in which a support part is 
provided with a surface lamination, and in which 

firstly a preform is made, which is equal in volume to 
the support part but is not equal in area thereto with 

respect to the end shaping, this is then joined by the 
action of pressure to the lamination by rear punching 

with the thermoplastic material of the support part by 
utilising inherent heat from its production, and 

reaches its final form by means of material flow 
processes, characterised in that characterised in that 

the preforms with the same finished support part 
volume, having the same contour shapes as the finished 

laminated formed part and having a grid-like structure 
at least in part areas, are subjected to the material 

flow process so that the initially open grid meshes of 
the preform are closed with the application of 

pressure for the rear punching process by localised 
flow. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
preforms with different mesh shapes and/or different 

thickness in some areas are subjected to the material 
flow process. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the preforms are brought into the course of the 

process together with additional structural elements 
integrally formed onto the rear side, e.g. retainer 

elements or similar. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that reinforcement inserts in the  

 
form of wires, fibres and/or strips are embedded into 

the grid structure of the preform before this is 
subjected to the rear punching process. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by the use of preformed laminating 

materials. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the rear punching of at least 

two areas of the lamination, which is made of 
different laminating materials, is carried out in at 

least two process steps directly following one 
another, whereby the seams between the part 

laminations are also punched in in the form of shadow 
joins. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the punching tool is deaerated 

in the region of the grid meshes of the preform during 
the rear punching. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the preforms are made directly 

before the rear punching process by deforming 
thermoplastic materials. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the preforms are produced from plane, panel-shaped 

starting material by hot-deformation directly before 
the rear punching process. 
Formed part produced according to the process of Claim 
1 and at least one of Claims 2 to 9, formed out of a  

 
preform with ends deformed by rear punching and with 

at least partially original grid structure, and 
surface lamination joined to this firmly over the 

surface solely by the application of heat and/or 
pressure.
