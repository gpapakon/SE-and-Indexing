<ABSTRACT>
Hot melt packaging adhesive compositions consisting essentially of 20 to 
50% by weight of an ethylene n-butyl acrylate copolymer containing 25-45% by 

weight, preferably 30 to 40% n-butyl acrylate and having a melt index of at least 
10; 30 to 60% of an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon resin or hydrogenated 

derivative thereof or a hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbon resin; and 10 to 30% 
by weight of a high melting synthetic wax provide adhesives characterized by an 

excellent balance of high and low temperature performance without sacrifice to 
machinability or thermal stability. Further, the adhesive is characterized by 

a low density and consequently is readily filterable in recycling systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hot melt adhesives are widely used in industry for various applications 
such as product assembly and packaging, including particularly, for use in 
cardboard case sealing and carton closing operations. Some of these operations 
(e.g., for cartons, cases or trays used for packaging molten cheese at 60°C and 
its subsequent storage at freezer temperatures of -18 to -6°C or for packaging 
yogurt or freshly baked goods at temperatures greater than about 40°C) require 
a hot melt adhesive with exceptionally high heat resistance (ability to maintain 
a fiber tearing bond at elevated temperatures) without sacrificing good cold 
resistance (ability to maintain a high strength bond in the cold with no tendency 
to fracture). Moreover, the viscosity of such adhesives must be low enough and 
the set speed fast enough to give good machinability, for example, on rapid-fire, 
automatic equipment with short compression sections which are used in commercial 
case or carton operations. The thermal stability and aesthetics also must be 
such as to produce no charring, skin, or gel formation coupled with a small 
viscosity change following prolonged aging at typical operating temperatures 
(e.g., 200°C) so as to minimize down time for maintenance and to provide 
consistent application patterns and amounts during operation. These aesthetic 
considerations have become more important in recent years as customers 
increasingly demand hot melt adhesives having pot clarity, i.e., adhesives which 
are clear in their molten form. Hot melt case and carton sealing products available and in commercial use 
today (primarily polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate formulations) lack one 
or more of the previously described properties; (1) high temperature end use 
performance; (2) low temperature end use performance; (3) clean machining; (4) 
low viscosity; (5) desirable aesthetics (clarity); (6) satisfactory thermal  
 
stability; (7) and/or low cloud point (below 120°C). It would therefore be an 
advance in the art to provide another hot melt adhesive having good bond 
strengths (i.e., producing fiber tear) at both high and low temperatures coupled 
with low viscosity, fast set speed and excellent thermal stability, machining and 
aesthetics. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,816,306 and 4,874,804 to Brady, et al., disclose that 
hot melt packaging adhesive compositions consisting essentially of 35 to 45% by 
weight of an ethylene n-butyl acrylate copolymer containing 25-45% by weight n-butyl 
acrylate and having a melt index of at least 50; 35
