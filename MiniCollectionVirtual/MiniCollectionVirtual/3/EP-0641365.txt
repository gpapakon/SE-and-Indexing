<DESCRIPTION>
 MANUFACTURE OF TEREPHTHALIC ACID COPOLYAMIDESThe present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of copolyamides of terephthalic acid, and especially to the manufacture of such copolyamides without formation of a high melting fraction.As used herein, a "single step" polymerization process is a polymerization process in which monomers are subjected to a polymerization cycle in a reactor that concludes with the pressure being returned to substantially atmospheric pressure. It is understood that the copolyamide obtained from such a process may be subjected to further processing, including finishing and extrusion, before or after pelletization.Polymers formed from terephthalic acid and diamines are known in the art. For instance, PCT patent application WO 92/10525 of S.L. Mok and R.U. Pagilagan, published 1992 June 25, discloses copolyamides of terephthalic acid with hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine, optionally containing isophthalic acid, having melting points of at least 280°C. Other polyamides of terephthalic acid are referred to therein. Single-step polymerization processes have the advantage that polymer is manufactured in a single step, as opposed to two step or multi-step processes, thereby reducing handling of the partially formed polymer during the intermediate stages of the process. However, in the manufacture of copolyamides of terephthalic acid, especially copolyamides of terephthalic acid, hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine, using a single step polymerization process, it has been found that a high melting fraction is formed. The high melting fraction, with a melting point in excess of 320°C and especially approximately-334°C, is usually not noticed in the first batch of polymer produced in an autoclave, but becomes apparent in subsequent batches made in the same autoclave without 

steps being taken to clean-out the autoclave between consecutive batches. As the polymer would normally be subsequently processed at melt temperatures of less than 320βC, the high melting fraction manifests itself as unmelted or gel-like portions of polymer, which are commercially unacceptable; the gel-like portions are believed to be essentially comprised of a high melting crystalline phase, which is soluble in sulphuric acid, and not gel per se which would not be soluble in sulphuric acid.It has now been found that copolymers of terephthalic acid, optionally including isophthalic acid, and mixtures of hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene

CLAIMS :
1. A process for the preparation of a partially crystalline copolyamide comprising the polymerization stages of: (a) feeding to a reactor an aqueous salt solution of an admixture of aromatic carboxylic acid and aliphatic diamine, said aromatic carboxylic acid being selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid and mixtures of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid and said aliphatic diamine being a mixture of hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine;
(b) heating the aqueous salt solution under pressure and venting water and other volatile matter from the reactor;
(c) reducing the pressure in the reactor to atmospheric pressure;
(d) controlling stages (b) and (c) so as to avoid excessive foaming of the admixture in the reactor; and
(e) discharging the copolyamide so obtained from the reactor; the combined amount of isophthalic acid and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine fed to the reactor in stage (a) being selected so that on being annealed the copolyamide has less than 1% by weight, based on the total amount of copolyamide, of fractions with melting points greater than 320°C.
2. The process of Claim 1 in which the stages of the process are controlled so that the copolyamide produced has an inherent viscosity of at least 0.6 dL/g.
3. The process of Claim 2 in which the copolyamide has an inherent viscosity of at least 0.8 dL/g. 4. The process of any one of Claims 1-3 in which stage (c) additionally includes maintaining the admixture in the reactor under a vacuum. 


 5. The process of any one of Claims 1-4 in which the acid and diamine are selected such that the combined amount of isophthalic acid and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine is greater than 27.5%, molar basis, of the total amount of acid and diamine.
6. The process of any one of Claims 1-4 in which the acid and diamine are selected such that the combined amount of isophthalic acid and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine is greater than 30%, molar basis, of the total amount of acid and diamine.
7. The process of any one of Claims 1-6 in which the copolyamide has less than 0.1% by weight of the fraction with an annealed melting point of greater than 320°C. 8. The process of any one of Claims 1-6 in which the copolyamide has less than 0.01% by weight of the fraction with an annealed melting point of greater than 320°C.
9. In a process for the preparation of multiple consecutive batches of a partially crystalline copolyamide of terephthalic acid and hexamethylene diamine in a reactor without clean-out of the reactor, in which the copolyamide obtained from such process contains more than 1% by weight of a fraction with an annealed melting point of greater than 320°C, said process comprising the stages of:
(a) feeding to a reactor an aqueous salt solution of an admixture of aromatic carboxylic acid and aliphatic diamine, said aromatic carboxylic acid being selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid and mixtures of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid and said aliphatic diamine being a mixture of hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine; (b) heating the aqueous salt solution under pressure and venting water and other volatile matter from the reactor; 


 (c) reducing the pressure in the reactor to atmospheric pressure;
