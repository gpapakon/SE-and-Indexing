A dental single-tooth implant for a fixed false tooth, having an essentially cylindrical basic body which can be inserted in a bore introduced into a jaw bone and has a blind bore which is open towards its coronal end, having a spacer sleeve which can be fitted onto the coronal end edge of the basic body, having an implant stump which can be inserted in the blind bore of the basic body and connected securely against rotation to the basic body, having a connection device for attaching the spacer sleeve to the basic body, and having an attachment head for the false tooth connected to the implant stump, is characterised in that the attachment head and the connection device are configured as an integral bell-like annular cap (46) which is open at the cervical end, surrounds the implant stump (44) concentrically, and whose annular apron (50) engages over the junction between the outer circumference of the basic body (10) and the spacer sleeve (22) and is configured in its cervical region in such a way that it merges smoothly into the cylindrical circumferential wall of the basic body.
