<ABSTRACT>
An electrolysis cell for the production of aluminium by the electrolysis of alumina dissolved in a molten halide electrolyte, preferably at a temperature below 880  DEG C, using a multimonopolar arrangement of substantially non-consumable anodes (2) and cathodes (1) with facing operative surfaces which are upright or at a slope and are in spaced substantially parallel relationship, enabling operation at low anode current density with an acceptable production per unit cell floor area. The operative surface area of the anodes (2) and cathodes (1) is high due to their upright of sloping configuration. The operative surfaces of the anodes (2) and possibly of the cathodes (1) can be increased by making them porous, preferably with a reticulated skeletal structure, e.g. with a porous active part (13) on opposite faces of a central current feeder (12). There is an upward circulation of electrolyte by gas lift between the electrodes, there being electrolyte circulation guide means such as spacers (5) adjacent the edges of the facing anodes (2) and cathodes (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cell for producing 
aluminium by electrolysis of alumina dissolved in a molten 
halide electrolyte particularly at temperatures between 
680°-880°C. Aluminium is produced by the Hall-Héroult process 
which involves the electrolysis of alumina dissolved in 
molten cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) at about 960°C using carbon 
anodes which are consumed with the evolution of CO₂. 
However, the process suffers from major disadvantages. The 
high cell temperature is necessary to increase the 
solubility of alumina and its rate of dissolution so that 
sufficient alumina can be maintained in solution, but 
requires heavy expenditure of energy. At the high cell 
temperature, the electrolyte and the molten aluminium 
aggressively react with most materials including ceramic 
and carbonaceous materials, and this creates problems of 
containment and cell design. The anode-cathode distance is 
critical and has to be maintained high due to the 
irregular movement of the molten aluminium cathode pool, 
and this leads to loss of energy. Since the anodes are 
continually being consumed, this creates problems of 
process control. Further, the back oxidation of Al to Al³⁺ 
decreases the current efficiency.  
 Potentially, the electrolysis of alumina at low 
temperatures (below 880°C) in halide melts has several 
distinct advantages over the conventional Hall-Héroult 
process operating at about 960°C. As shown by bench-scale 
tests, electrolysis at reduced current densities in low 
temperature melts potentially offers a significant 
advantage in increasing the stability of electrode 
materials, but it has not yet proven possible to implement 
the process in a way where this advantage could be 
realised in larger scale cells and in commercial cells. 
Other potential advantages are higher current and energy 
efficiencies and the possibility of designing a completely 
enclosed electrolytic cell. Problems which hindered the practicability of low 
temperature electrolysis are the low alumina solubility in 
low temperature electrolytes, as well as low alumina 
solution rates. Under these conditions, a sufficiently 
high transport rate of oxide ion species from the bulk of 
the electrolyte to the anode surface cannot be maintained 
at the anode current densities normally used in 
conventional Hall-Héroult cells. The configuration of 
cells presently used does not permit a substantial 
increase of the relative surface area of anode to cathode. 
This means that a reduction of the current density would 
lead directly to
