<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, 
and particularly to a semiconductor device that employs 
mounting terminals. A semiconductor device employing mounting terminals has 
been conventionally known in the prior art, as shown in Figs. 
11 and 12. Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view of a 
semiconductor device (for example, pin-grid array type 
semiconductor device) employing mounting terminals known in 
the prior art. Fig. 12 is a partial bottom view of the 
semiconductor device shown in Fig. 11. The semiconductor device of Fig. 11 comprises a base 
resin substrate 102 and a semiconductor chip 104 rigidly 
mounted on the lower surface thereof. The semiconductor chip 
104 is connected by means of wires to a plurality of 
circuit patterns 106 formed around the chip 104 and on the 
lower surface of the substrate 102. The semiconductor chip 104 and the connecting portions 
between the chip 104 and the circuit patterns 106 are 
integrally, hermetically sealed with a resin 108. Mounting 
terminals 110 are inserted into a plurality of through holes 
112 which are arranged on the substrate 102 at the 
peripheral area thereof. As shown in Fig. 12, the through 
hole 112 is opened at at the center of land portion 114. An 
inner surface of the through hole 112 is plated with a metal 
to which the mounting terminal 110 is soldered. The mounting terminals 110 are connected to a circuit 
board (not shown) and thus the semiconductor device 100 can 
be surface-mounted thereon. The above-mentioned semiconductor device 100 has the 
following problems. Since it is necessary that the inner surface of the 
through hole 112 is metal-plated to secure the mounting  
 
terminals 110 to the substrate 102 so as to electrically 
connect to the circuit patterns 106. Thus a manufacturing 
cost is raised because of necessity of such a metal plating 
process. In addition, since the through hole 112 is positioned 
at the centre of the land portion 114, the diameter Z of 
the land portion 114 must be larger than the diameter of 
through hole 112. According to the recent requirement for 
high density of circuit patterns 106, for example, as 
shown in Fig. 12, if other circuit patterns 106 are 
arranged between two circuit patterns 106a and 106b (the 
distance therebetween being Y), the possible area X for 
the other circuit patterns 106 will be X = Y - Z. Therefore, 
if the diameter Z of the land portion 114 becomes 
larger, it will be difficult to attain a high density of 
circuit patterns 106. On the other hand, since
