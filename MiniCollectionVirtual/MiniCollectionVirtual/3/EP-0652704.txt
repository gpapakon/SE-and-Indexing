<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is the use of ether carboxylic acids of the general formula R-(OC2H4)n-OCH2COOH, in which R is C4-C10 alkyl and n is 2-8, as disinfectants in aqueous acid media comprising inorganic or organic acids or mixtures thereof, optionally together with other disinfectants and surfactants.

The use of ether carboxylic acids corresponding to 
the general formula 


R-(OC
2
H
4
)
n
-OCH
2
COOH
 
in which R may be an alkyl radical containing 4 to 

10 carbon atoms and n may be a number of 2 to 8, 
as germicidal substances in aqueous acidic media. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the content of ether carboxylic acids in the acidic media 

is 0.05 to 50% by weight and preferably 1 
to 10% by weight. 
The use claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that 1 to 99% by weight and preferably 50 

to 90% by weight of the acidic media consist of inorganic 
or organic acids or mixtures thereof. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the aqueous acidic media contain 0.05 to 50% 

by weight and preferably 1 to 10% by weight of an 
additional disinfecting component. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the additional disinfecting components are selected from 

the group of quaternary ammonium compounds, anionic 
surfactants, oxygen-yielding compounds, alkylphosphonic 

acids. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the acidic media additionally contain surfactants. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the quantity of surfactants is 0.5 to 20% by 

weight and preferably 1 to 10% by weight. 
The use claimed in claims 6 to 7, characterized in 
that the surfactants are nonionic surfactants. 
The use claimed in claims 6 to 8, characterized in 
that the mixing ratio in % by weight of ether carboxylic  

 
acids to nonionic surfactants is in the range from 

1:10 to 10:1 and preferably in the range from 
1:2 to 2:1. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the in-use solution contains 0.0005 to 5% by weight 

and preferably 0.01 to 1% by weight of the ether carboxylic 
acids. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 10, characterized in 
that the in-use solution contains 0.1 to 20% by weight 

and preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight of the organic or 
inorganic base acid.
