<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sheet transfer cylinder for printing machines using gripper bridges arranged distributed evenly and symmetrically over the circumference of the cylinder. The object of the invention is to ajust the gripper opening strips of the gripper bridges evenly for different thicknesses of the printing medium. This is achieved in that, for the uniform raising and lowering of the gripper opening strips 21, a drive motor 5 is arranged in the cylinder journal 4 of a sheet transfer cylinder 2 which is connected via a clutch 15 to centrally adjusting means 16. The centrally adjusting means 16 are coupled for each gripper bridge to a positioning device 20, which positioning devices move the gripper opening strips 21 in a radial direction by means of advancing wedges 19.

gripper links respectively formed of gripper shaft, 

grippers and adjustable gripper support bar and 
arranged evenly distributed at the periphery of the 

drum, characterised in that for unified high and low 
setting of the gripper support bars (21) a drive (5) 

is arranged in the drum trunnion (4) of the drum (2) 
and is fixed to the framework (1) which, via a link 

(15), is connected with central adjusting adjustment 
means (16, 17, 28, 29, 30) which are coupled for 

each gripper link 31 by means of a positioning 
device (20) coordinated to one of the gripper 

support bars (21).
