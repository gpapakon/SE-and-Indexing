<ABSTRACT>
A rack (20) has at least one support (22) and holding means, distributed preferably uniformly over its height and constructed as openings (32), into which supporting elements (24, 25) for receiving shelves (28), cupboards (18) or the like can be inserted. The supporting element (24, 25) has a plug-in part (24') which, after engagement in one or more holding means and in a guide rail (33) formed by the support (22), is retained in self-locking fashion in the support (22). With this solution according to the invention, a rack has been created whose supports are extremely simple to use and which overall has a high degree of stability.
