<ABSTRACT>
A round baler (10) having a main frame (11), a 
tailgate (14) pivotally connected to the main frame and an 

apron (32) extending around a plurality of guide rolls (33-38) 
disposed in the main frame and the tailgate. A pair of 

take up arms (41), rotatably mounted on the main frame, 
carry at least one additional guide roll (43, 44) for the 

apron. A bale forming chamber, including the apron, varies 
in size from a bale starting position to a full bale 

position. A crop loading monitor (45, 64) is provided for 
signalling the operator when the compactness of the crop 

material in at least one portion of the bale being formed 
in the bale forming chamber reaches a predetermined 

acceptable level. This signal is used by the operator for 
repositioning the baler (10) over the windrowed crop 

material in order to obtain a bale with a uniform 
compactness and a cylindrical shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to balers,
typically referred to as "round balers", which form
cylindrical bales of crop material, and more particularly
to apparatus and method for monitoring the degree of
compaction of crop material in the chamber in which the
bale is being formed.Round balers generally have a bale forming chamber
defined by a pair of opposing side walls associated with an
array of side-by-side belts, transverse slats trained on
chains, a plurality of rolls or a combination of these
various elements, e.g. rolls and belts. During field
operation, windrowed crop material such as hay or straw is
picked up from the ground and fed into a fixed or variable
diameter chamber. The hay or straw is then rolled into a
cylindrical package, wrapped with twine, net or the like
and ejected onto the ground for subsequent handling.Because it is not uncommon for windrows of crop
material to be uneven and typically narrower than the width
of the bale forming chamber, it is necessary for the
operator of some prior art balers to observe the shape of
the bale being formed and weave the baler in a generally
zigzag pattern to uniformly distribute the crop material
across the bale being formed and thereby avoid poorly
shaped bales. This approach relies on the experience of the
operator to determine when to laterally shift the position
of the baler. The lack of exactness, inability to observe
the bale shape, reliance on operator skill and operator
fatigue all contribute to the possibility of improper
feeding causing misshaped bales.In belt type balers where a substantially uniform
diameter is not maintained, improper tracking occurs
resulting in belt jamming and damage. In addition, the 
uneven shape of the bale causes low density areas on the
bale periphery which could result in premature
deterioration of the bale during field storage, where it is
exposed to weather extremes, i.e., the low density area
does not shed water as well as an evenly balanced and
uniformly compacted area.Many present day balers of the various types mentioned
above recognize the need for enhancing bale shape. Systems
are employed that address the problem of conveniently and
consistently forming bales having a substantially uniform
diameter throughout their length. This has been
accomplished to a certain degree by utilizing monitoring
arrangements to ascertain parameters that in turn are used
in the control of functions that have a direct bearing on
the shape of bales formed. A bale shape controlling system
of this type is
