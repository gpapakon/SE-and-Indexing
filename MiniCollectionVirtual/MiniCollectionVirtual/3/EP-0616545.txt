<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method for displaying 
the amount of drug delivered transdermally by iontophoresis. Iontophoresis is defined by Dorland's Illustrated Medical 
Dictionary as, "the introduction, by means of electric current, of 
ions of soluble salts into the tissues of the body for therapeutic 
purposes." Iontophoretic devices have been known since the early 
1900's. British patent specification No. 410,009, published in 
1934, describes an iontophoretic device that overcame one of the 
disadvantages of such early devices known to the art at that time, 
namely the requirement of a special low tension (low voltage) 
source of current which meant that the patient needed to be 
immobilized near such source. In that British specification, the 
device was made by forming a galvanic cell from two electrodes 
plus the material containing the medicament or drug to be 
transdermally delivered. The galvanic cell produced the current 
necessary for iontophoretically delivering the medicament. This 
ambulatory device thus permitted iontophoretic drug delivery with 
substantially less interference with the patient's daily 
activities. The iontophoresis process has been found to be useful in the 
transdermal administration of medicaments or drugs including 
lidocaine hydrochloride, hydrocortisone, fluoride, penicillin, 
dexamethasone sodium phosphate and many other drugs. Perhaps the 
most common use of iontophoresis is in diagnosing cystic fibrosis 
by delivering pilocarpine salts iontophoretically. The 
pilocarpine stimulates sweat production; the sweat is collected 
and analyzed for its chloride content to detect the presence of 
the disease.  
 Presently known iontophoretic devices use at least two 
electrodes, positioned in intimate contact with some portion of 
the skin of the body. A first electrode, called the active or 
donor electrode, delivers the ionic substance, medicament, drug 
precursor or drug into the body by iontophoresis. The second 
electrode, called the counter or return electrode, closes an 
electrical circuit including the body, the first electrode and a 
source of electrical energy, such as a battery. For example, if 
the ionic substance to be driven into the body is positively 
charged, the anode will be the active electrode and the cathode 
will serve as the counter electrode to complete the circuit. If 
the ionic substance to be delivered is negatively charged, the 
cathode will be the active electrode and the anode will be the 
counter electrode. Alternatively, both
