<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a charging method for batteries (accumulators), in particular for NiCd and NiMH cells. According to the invention, the increase in the charging voltage is measured in a unit of time corresponding to a specific voltage value in each case during successive charging cycles of specific duration. The number of these units of time is fed as a counting pulse to two up/down counters (bidirectional counters) over the duration of the charging cycle, one counter operating in the counting down mode and having at the beginning of a charging cycle a count corresponding to the number of units of time which were determined in the preceding charging cycle. The roles of the two counters are exchanged in the subsequent charging cycle, with the result that the counting-up counter is switched into the counting down mode and the other counter is switched into the counting up mode, the last-mentioned counter being set at a specific initial counter reading. After each charging cycle, the final counter reading of the counting-down counter is compared with the specific initial state and a turn-off criterion for the charging operation is derived from this. This method according to the invention allows both positive and negative changes in the dU/dt value of the charging curve to be detected, in conjunction with a high voltage resolution and at the same time a low outlay.

A charging process for accumulators, in particular for 
NiCd (nickel-cadmium) and NiH (nickel-hydride) cells, in 

which the accumulators are supplied from a charging current 
source, characterised by the following features: 


a) in order to produce charging cycles of a specific 
duration, the charging current source is cyclically cut 

off from the accumulator, 
b) in consecutive charging cycles a measurement is in each 
case carried out of the voltage increase in the charging 

voltage in a measurement unit corresponding to a 
specified voltage value, 
c) at the start of a charging cycle 

c1) a first forwards/backwards counter (9) is set at a 
defined starting count of a 
>
 0 and is switched 
into the forwards mode while 
c2) a second forwards/backwards counter (10) is 
switched into the backwards mode wherein, at the 

start of the charging cycle, it possesses a count 
(e) which corresponds to the sum of the value of 

the defined starting count a and the value of the 
units of the voltage increase of the preceding 

charging cycle, 
d) the number of units of the voltage increase established 
over a charging cycle is fed as count value to the first 

and second counters (9, 10), 
e) at the end of a charging cycle the amount of the 
difference between the count (e) of the counter 

operating in the backwards mode and the defined starting 
count a is determined and 


e1) the charging process is ended if the difference 
amount is greater than a specified positive value 

(m), otherwise 
e2) the charging process is continued with a charging 
cycle in that process steps c) to e) are repeated  

 
in such manner that now the counter operating in 

the backwards mode is set at the defined starting 
count a and switched into the forwards mode and the 

counter operating in the forwards mode is switched 
into the backwards 
mode. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
for the measurement of the voltage increase over a charging 

cycle the following process steps are carried out: 

a) equidistant times are defined over the duration of a 
charging cycle, 
b) at each of these times a comparison is carried out 
between the charging voltage (U
ist
) and a reference 
value (U
ref
), where, when a voltage increase has been 
determined, the reference value (U
ref
) is increased by 
the voltage value provided as measurement unit and 
c) every increase by one measurement unit is fed as 
counting pulse to the two counters (9, 10). 
A process as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that 
at the start of a charging cycle the reference value (U
ref
) 
corresponds to the instantaneous charging voltage (U
ist
). 
A process as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a preliminary charging comprising the 

following process steps is carried out: 

a) equidistant times are defined for the measurement of the 
charging voltage (U
ist
), 
b) at these times a comparison is carried out between the 
charging voltage (U
ist
) and a reference voltage (U
ref
), 
c) if at one of these times the charging voltage (U
ist
) is 
identical to the reference value (U
ref
), the 
forwards/backwards counters (9, 10) are activated for 

the execution of the main charging and 
d) if at these times the charging voltage (U
ist
) is greater 
than the reference value (U
ref
), the reference value is  
 

increased by a specified voltage value and forms the 
reference value (U
ref
) for the comparison measurement at 
the following time. 
A process as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
the preliminary charging and main charging are carried out 

with equal charging current strength. 
A process as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that at the times for the measurement of the 

voltage increases, the charging cycle is in each case 
interrupted for a short time interval. 
A process as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the last charging cycle is followed by 

a secondary charging with a secondary charging current 
reduced in comparison to the charging current supplied for 

the last charging cycle. 
A process as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that 
the secondary charging, the so-called top-off charging, is 

ended after a specified time interval.
