<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein are a method for disposing of 
organic waste materials using microorganisms; methods for 

accelerating the growth of plants, for destroying or 
repelling insect pests, for improving the soil, of 

deodorization and for improving water quality, using the 
waste materials processed by the disposal method; and 

compositions for use in these methods. The 
microbiological method for disposing of an organic waste 

material comprises the step of bringing (i) an organic 
waste material into contact with (ii) at least 5 species 

of microorganisms, each being selected from each of 5 
groups consisting of actinomycetes, phototrophic 

bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, mold fungi and yeast, the 
microorganisms (a) being acid-fast, (b) capable of 

producing lactic acid, (c) producing no butyric acid, (d) 
being non-pathogenic and (e) having an antagonistic value 

of 50 or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
disposing of organic waste materials using
microorganisms, and a use of the waste materials
processed by this disposal method. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a method for disposing
of organic waste materials, methods for accelerating the
growth of plants, for destroying or repelling insect
pests, for improving the soil, for deodorizing unpleasant
odors and for improving water, using the waste materials
processed by the disposal method; and compositions for
use in these methods.One of the major problems of society is to
efficiently dispose of organic wastes and sometimes to
effectively utilize them.For instance, liquid waste discharged in a process
of alcohol production has been utilized as livestock feed
or an organic fertilizer put on fields. However, this
liquid waste deteriorates quickly, so that its
utilization is limited. In addition, when this liquid
waste flows into rivers, the biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) increases drastically, threatening the ecosystem of
the rivers with destruction. Furthermore, since the
liquid waste has potent reducing power, there is a
possibility that soil and underground water are polluted
when the liquid waste permeates the soil. For these
reasons, it is the present situation that the liquid
waste is, in most cases, handled and disposed as
industrial waste, not used efficiently.An effective method for disposing of the above
liquid waste has not been found so far. Because the
liquid waste discharged in the process of alcohol 
production contains organic acids, it exhibits high
acidity at the outset of discharge. The liquid waste is
however alkalized swiftly as the oxidization thereof
proceeds. This alkalization brings about a rapid
increase of anaerobic putrefying bacteria such as butyric
acid bacteria. As a result, the liquid waste produces
extremely strong unpleasant odors. Furthermore, since
the protein and the amino acid contents of this liquid
waste are extremely high, large quantities of hydrogen
sulfide, ammonia, mercaptan and the like are produced in
the degenerating process of the liquid waste. It has been
said that an unpleasant odor released from a mixture of
the above compounds produced and acetic acid has a nature
of the worst kind.In general, the liquid waste discharged in the
process of alcohol production is alkalized, specifically
to a pH of 8 or more. Under such conditions, ordinary
microorganisms cannot be active. For this reason, it
cannot be expected that the liquid waste is degraded
