<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the production of naturally cloudy fruit drinks, in particular naturally cloudy stone fruit drinks, according to the invention a fruit product having a high stable natural cloud content being mixed with fruit juice concentrate (with a low cloud content or clear). The usual quality criteria with respect to a naturally cloudy fruit drink produced by standard processes, such as analytical composition, sensory properties, cloudiness, cloud stability, colour, colour stability, storage stability etc., are substantially unchanged.

Process for preparing a fruit beverage with a stable natural cloud through mixing a 
clouding component of the beverage with a low-cloudiness component of the 

beverage, without adding a cloud stabilisation agent, characterised in that a proportion 
of the non-concentrated clouding component which is less than 50% is mixed with a 

proportion of the low-cloudiness component which exceeds 50% and that a standard, 
storable fruit juice full concentrate is used as the low-cloudiness component. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that a whole fruit preparation (fruit 
puree) obtained through straining is used as the clouding component. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterised in that the proportion of whole fruit 
preparation used is less than 22%, with the remainder being a low-cloudiness 

component. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that a juice obtained by means of 
mechanical separating processes is used as the clouding component. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterised in that a juice with a high level of 
cloudiness is used, the cloud content of which is expressed as a cloudiness value and 

is greater than 1500 cloudiness units / formazin. 
Process according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the proportion of juice used is 
less than 35%, the remainder being a low-cloudiness component. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that, during preparation, 
the mash is left to stand for a period, which should preferably be between one hour 

and eight hours, before the juice is extracted, in order to increase the cloud yield and 
the cloud stability.  

 
Process according to Claim 7, characterised in that the temperature of the product lies 
between approximately 10 and 45° C during its standing period. 
Claim according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the clouding component 
and the low-cloudiness component are obtained from the same fruit variety or from a 

number of different fruit varieties. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the clouding 
component particles are reduced in size prior to mixing, preferably to a particle size 

which is smaller than 50 µm and then once again to a size which is preferably smaller 
than 10 µm, and whereby the wet crushing is preferably carried out with the aid of 

high-pressure homogenisers or colloid mills or other physical methods. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that at least one enzyme 
which is suitable for increasing the juice and/or cloud yield is added to the clouding 

component. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that a fruit juice 
concentrate is used as the low-cloudiness component, the cloud content of which is 

expressed as a cloudiness value and is less than 250 cloudiness units / formazin. 
Process according to one of Claims 11 to 12, characterised in that the level of 
concentration reaches a content of dissolved dry substance of 80 degrees Brix. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that size reduction 
processes, preferably as described in Claim 10, and / or separation processes such as 

centrifuging are used either before or after the mixing of the two components. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised in that the aroma which is 
obtained during the preparation of fruit juice concentrate, in the case of fruit juice or 

fruit nectar from the fruit which gives it its name, is added to the mixture.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 15, characterised in that gas is removed from 
the mixture, preferably leaving a residual oxygen content which is less than 1 mg/l. 
Fruit beverage, prepared according to the process described in one or several of 
Claims 1 to 16, characterised in that the fruit beverage has a juice content greater than 

or equal to 50%. 
Fruit beverage, prepared according to the process described in one or several of 
Claims 1 to 17, characterised in that its cloud content, expressed as a cloudiness value, 

is between 200 and 1500 cloudiness units / formazin and preferably between 300 and 
1000 cloudiness units / formazin.
