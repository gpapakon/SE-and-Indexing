exhaust valve of an internal combustion engine by being 

reciprocated in the working cylinder (2); and a damper 
provided in the working cylinder (2) for controlling the 

speed of the intake or exhaust valve. The damper further 
includes: a first damper member (11, 31) having a 

projecting portion (13, 32) provided in the top portion 
of the working cylinder (2) to which the working oil is 

supplied; a second damper member (22) including a 
recessed portion (21), the second damper member (22) 

being moved in the working cylinder (2) together with the 
piston (4) accompanied by the reciprocating motion of the 

intake or exhaust valve, the recessed portion (21) being 
fitted to the projecting portion (13, 32) of the first 

damper member (11, 31) on closing the intake or exhaust 
valve for forming an oil chamber (23) with the first 

damper member (11, 31); and a valve unit (14, 33) 
provided in the first damper member (11, 31), which is 

opened on opening the intake or exhaust valve for 
introducing the working oil into the oil chamber (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydraulic intake/exhaust valve drive 
unit according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a hydraulic intake/exhaust valve drive unit is known from 
JP-A-60 085 208, wherein a damper chamber is formed in a piston 
which drives a valve, and a damping element projects into this 
chamber. A passage and a check valve are provided in the damping 
element and, when opening the valve, the oil being introduced 
into a cylinder is also introduced into the damper chamber 
through the passage and the check valve, causing smooth valve 
opening movement to take place. When closing the valve, the 
check valve closes the passage, causing the damper chamber to 
produce a damping effect.  
 In the technical field of an internal combustion 
engine, various types of mechanisms for opening/closing 
an intake or exhaust valve using oil pressure have been 
proposed. For example, Fig.3 is a sectional view 
showing a prior art hydraulic intake/exhaust valve drive 
unit provided with a damper for use in an internal 
combustion engine. An intake or exhaust valve (not shown) is driven by 
a working cylinder 100. A piston 101 is provided in the 
working cylinder 100 in such a manner as to be freely 
reciprocated. The upper end of a valve rod 102 for the 
intake or exhaust valve is connected to the lower end of 
the piston 101. A working oil is supplied from an oil 
passage 103 provided on the upper portion of the working 
cylinder 100. The working oil, which is supplied at a 
high pressure by an oil pressure generating pump in 
synchronization with the drive of the internal combustion 
engine, pushes down the piston 101, to thus open the  
 
intake or exhaust valve. On closing of the intake or 
exhaust valve, the flow of the working oil is reversed to 
that on opening of the valve, that is, the working oil is 
discharged from the oil passage 103 to the exterior of 
the working cylinder 100, and the intake or exhaust valve 
is returned to a specified upper position by a biasing 
means such as an air spring (not shown). A damper 104 for controlling the speed of the intake 
or exhaust valve is provided in the working cylinder 100. 
A first damper member 106 having a projecting portion 105 
is provided on the inner surface of the top portion of 
the working cylinder 100. On the other hand, a second 
damper member 108 having a recessed portion 107 
corresponding to the projecting portion 105 is provided 
on the upper surface of the piston 101. On closing the 
intake or exhaust valve, both the damper members 106
