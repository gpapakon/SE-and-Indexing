<ABSTRACT>
It is of the kind that comprises two uprights (1) and 
rungs (2) attached between same. It is characterised by 

the fact that the uprights (1) have, for attachment of 
the rung (2), a recess (3) on their edge where a lug (5) 

is attached threaded, which has a protrusion (8) on its 
inner edge, which matches said recess (3) and on the lug 

(5) of which the rung (2) rests and is held up by its 
end, by way of the threading of a tubular finish (9) of 

said end on the lug (5). Between the lug (5) and the 
tubular finish (9), support (10) and anchorage (11,12) 

components have been provided, which ensure the 
attachment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a ladder and, more 
particularly, to the means for attachment of the rungs to 
the uprights. Although this ladder can be constituted in any 
manner and applied to differing functions, it has been 
designed mainly to be used in swimming pools. GB-A-1 089 761 discloses a ladder of the kind in which the stiles of the ladder each comprises two lengths of tubular cross-section having recesses for coupling the protrusions of a bracing piece which surrounds the periphery of the two lengths and is adapted to receive one end of a rung of the ladder. The object of this invention is to obtain a ladder 
at a reasonable price and at the same time which is easy 
to assemble, enabling it to be assembled by anybody, 
making this ladder suitable, for example, for marketing 
as "do-it-yourself" merchandise, the consumer being able 
to buy the component parts loose and to assemble it 
himself. According to the invention this object is achieved with the features as defined in claim 1. In this ladder, the conventional assembly of the 
rungs to the upright using screws and nuts has been 
dispensed with, and at the same time the holes to be made 
in the uprights are eliminated, so they are not weakened. Between the bushing and the tubular end, support 
components may be provided to hold up the rungs. Likewise, between the bushing and the tubular end of 
the rung, anchoring components may be fitted, which ensure 
mutual attachment. Preferably the bushing is open on one of its generating lines to 
assist its attachment to the upright. These and other characteristics can be appreciated  
 
better from the detailed description which follows, to 
assist which a sheet of sketches is attached, 
representing a practical case of application, which is 
cited solely for the purpose of an example and is not 
limitative of the scope of the invention. In the sketches: 
Figure 1 represents a piece by piece perspective of 
the means for attachment of the rungs to the uprights. Figure 2 illustrates an elevational cross-section of 
the attachment of the rung to the upright, and Figure 3 is a plan view of said attachment. As per the sketches, the metal, tubular uprights 1 
present a recess 3 on their periphery, at the spot where the 
rungs 2 are to be attached, which in this case is 
achieved by press drawing, the result being two opposite 
arched recesses, separated by two opposite ridges 4. Two plastic bushings 5 are attached on the uprights in 
each recess 3 by threading; these bushings are open on one of 
their

<CLAIMS>
A ladder comprising two uprights (1) and a plurality of 
rungs (2) attached therebetween, each upright (1) having 

for attachement of each rung (2) a recess (3) on its external 
periphery for mounting a bushing (5) on the upright 

(2), said bushing (5) having a protusion (8) on 
its inner surface which matches said recess (3), characterized 

in that each rung comprises a tubular end (9) 
which is mounted coaxially on the bushing (5), the rung 

(2) being supported and maintained in position by 
coacting means (10, 11, 12) between the bushing (5) and 

the tubular rung end (9). 
A ladder according to claim 1, in which, between the 
bushing (5) and the tubular rung end (9), support components 

comprising a flange (10) in the lower external periphery 
of the bushing (5) are provided. 
A ladder according to claim 1, in which anchoring components 
(11, 12) between the bushing (5) and the tubular 

rung end (9) are provided, said anchoring components 
comprising a flexible finger (11) topped by an external 

claw (12) provided at the periphery of the bushing (5), 
said claw (12) engaging on the upper edge of the tubular 

rung end (9). 
A ladder according to claim 1, in which the bushing is a 
single piece split along one of its generating lines (6) 

to assist its attachment to the upright (1).
