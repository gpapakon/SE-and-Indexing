<ABSTRACT>
A fire detecting apparatus includes a first dust recovering 
part (34) at a midpoint in an air inlet passage (35a, 31a) 

into a fire detecting part. The airflow is deflected in the 
first dust recovering part (34) so as to cause the dust to 

drop, to separate from the air, and to be recovered by the 
recovering part (34). Farther downstream than the first dust 

recovering part (34), a second dust recovering part (36) is 
arranged to have a filter (37, 38, 39) for recovering the dust 

in the air which has passed through the first recovering part 
(34). Thus, the filter (37, 38, 39) is prevented from being 

clogged by the dust, and erroneous operations of the fire 
detecting part caused by dust are prevented more reliably. 

A plurality of filters (37, 38, 39) may be placed from 
upstream successively, in the order from larger to smaller 

meshes, so that larger dust particles are recovered by the 
filter (37) having larger meshes, and the filter (39) having 

smaller meshes is prevented from clogging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fire detecting apparatus
comprising a fire detecting part for detecting the presence of
a fire by detecting smoke in the air introduced from a
supervision area into the fire detecting part through an inlet
passage within which dust protection means are arranged,
according to the introduction of claim 1, as disclosed in EP-A-0 324 295.Conventionally, a fire detecting part of the fire
detecting apparatus of this type is known such as ionization
type, light scattering type, or light obscuration type. No
matter which type is used, such a fire detecting part
detects smoke in the air introduced from a supervision area so
as to detect the presence of a fire according to the density
of the smoke.Fig. 6 is a schematic view of the construction of one
example of a conventional fire detecting apparatus of light
scattering type (photoelectric type) similar to that disclosed in EP-A-0 324 295. Referring to Fig. 6,
an air inlet 2 is arranged to face a supervision area 1 and
a filter 3 is provided for the air inlet 2. A detecting
part case 4 is connected to the air inlet 2. A light-emitting
device 5 is mounted on an inner wall of the
detecting part case 4. Also, a light-receiving device 7 is
mounted On a preamplifier 6 arranged within the detecting
part case 4. A plurality of light-screening plates 8
protrude from the inner walls of the detecting part case 4.
The fire detecting part 9 comprises the above-noted 
detecting part case 4, the light-emitting device 5, the
preamplifier 6, the light-receiving device 7 and the light-screening
plates 8. A suction fan 10 is connected to the
outside of the detecting part case 4. A fire determining
part 11 is electrically connected to the preamplifier 6.The operation of the above fire detecting apparatus
will now be described. The suction fan 10 is driven so as
to allow the air in the supervision area 1 to be induced
into the detecting part case 4 from the air inlet 2 through
the filter 3 and to be discharged from the suction fan 10.
During this procedure, the light-emitting device 5 emits
light, which is normally screened by the light-screening
plates 8, thereby preventing the light from being received
by the light-receiving device 7.However, when smoke is present in the air induced into
the detecting part case 4, the light emitted from the light-emitting
device 5 is scattered due to smoke particles and is
received by the light-receiving device 7, thereby detecting
the smoke. When the smoke is thus detected by the light-receiving
device 7, a
