<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 1H-indole-3-acetamides
useful for inhibiting sPLA2 mediated release of fatty acids
for conditions such as septic shock.The structure and physical properties of human non-pancreatic
secretory phospholipase A2 (hereinafter called,
"sPLA2") has been thoroughly described in two articles,
namely, "Cloning and Recombinant Expression of Phospholipase
A2 Present in Rheumatoid Arthritic Synovial Fluid" by
Seilhamer, Jeffrey J.; Pruzanski, Waldemar; Vadas Peter;
Plant, Shelley; Miller, Judy A.; Kloss, Jean; and Johnson,
Lorin K.; The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 264, No.
10, Issue of April 5, pp. 5335-5338, 1989; and "Structure and
Properties of a Human Non-pancreatic Phospholipase A2" by
Kramer, Ruth M.; Hession, Catherine; Johansen, Berit; Hayes,
Gretchen; McGray, Paula; Chow, E. Pingchang; Tizard, Richard;
and Pepinsky, R. Blake; The Journal of Biological Chemistry,
Vol. 264, No. 10, Issue of April 5, pp. 5768-5775, 1989. It is believed that sPLA2 is a rate limiting enzyme in
the arachidonic acid cascade which hydrolyzes membrane
phospholipids. Thus, it is important to develop compounds
which inhibit sPLA2 mediated release of fatty acids (e.g.,
arachidonic acid). Such compounds would be of value in
general treatment of conditions induced and/or maintained by
overproduction of sPLA2; such as septic shock, adult
respiratory distress syndrome, pancreatitis, trauma, bronchial
asthma, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and etc.Indolyl-3 substituted compounds having glyoxylamide
functionality are described in U.S. Patent 2,825,734. This
patent related to a process for converting glyoxyamides to 3-(2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl
) indoles.U.S. Patent No. 3,271,416 describes indolyl aliphatic
acids as sun screening agents and intermediates. These acids
may be -NH2 substituted (see, definition of M in claim 1) and
require 5- or 6- position substitution with nitrogen or sulfur
functional groups.U.S. Patent No. 2,890,223 and the article "The Synthesis
of Tryptamines Related to Serotonin", by Elliott Shaw, J. Am.
Chem. Soc., Vol. 77, 1955, (pp. 4319-4324) describe several
amide derivatives of 3-indoleacetic acids. These compounds
are used in the preparation of 5-lower alkoxy tryptamines and
are stated to have utility for influencing serotonin related
functions in the brain. In addition, the article, "Recherches
en serie indolique. VI sur tryptamines substituees", by Marc
Julia, Jean Igolen and Hanne Igolen, Bull. Soc. Chim. France,
1962, pp. 1060-1068, describes certain
