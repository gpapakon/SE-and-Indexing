<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to stitchbonded, durable, absorbent articles made 
using a stitching yarn having fibers of differing heat stabilities, and to methods of 
producing such articles. Parella, J.C., "Nonwoven Technology and Wipers", paper presented at 
INDA-TEC 1989, presents a perceptive account of the nonwoven industry. 
Specifically, Parella describes and compares the four primary techniques that 
commercial manufacturers have focused on for producing wipes. In order of 
commercialization they are: 
dry staple (carded, air laid, saturation or spray bonded webs made from 
textile fibers); air-lay (fabric made by air laying and bonding cellulosic or synthetic pulp 
fibers); melt blown (webs formed by in-line melt spinning of very fine fibers); and spunlace (fabrics produced by hydraulic entangling of fibers). Parella compares these primarily using the "alphabet" of consumer driven 
requirements for wipes: 
"A" for absorbency; "B" for bulk density; "C" for consistency; "D" for durability; 
and "P" for price. Dry staple nonwoven wipes were acceptable in terms of A and D, but P 
was a premium over 100% cellulosic paper wipes. Wipes made using the air-lay 
process generally met consumer needs for A, B, C, and P but fell short on 
improving D over already available dry staple nonwoven wipes. Despite this, 
product acceptance was almost immediate in industrial and consumer sectors. 
Fabrics made from melt blown fibers exhibited outstanding oil absorbency, and 
aqueous absorbency was acceptable. Adsorption or entrapment is the method of 
absorbency employed rather than absorption into the fiber or cellulose as in the use 
of the dry staple or air laying techniques. B, C, D, and P were adequate but not 
dramatically different from prior wipes. Spunlaced fabrics were said to be "the 
most complete nonwoven wiper seen to date" in terms of A, B, C, and D, and P 
was "within the range of acceptance given the performance characteristics. "  
 Whitehead et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,881,490), at column 4, line 63, through 
column 5, line 68) gives a respectable rendition of the air-lay technique of 
fabricating nonwoven wipes. However, Anderson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324) 
describes one apparent disadvantage of air lay wood pulp fiber webs, that they 
exhibit reduced absorbent capacity and rate (as compared to mechanically 
entangled webs of wood and synthetic pulp fibers) due to the adhesive used to 
contain the wood pulp fibers. Stitchbonding, as a method of bonding two fabrics together to form a 
durable,

A stitchbonded absorbent article characterized by a nonwoven batt 
consisting essentially of cellulosic pulp fibers bonded together by an adhesive 

binder, the batt having a basis weight of at least about 95 gsm per ply, the article 
stitchbonded by stitches of yarn, at a stitch density ranging from about 15 to about 

35 st/10cm, and stitch gauge ranging from about 10 to about 40, using a stitching 
yarn comprising at least two compositionally different fibers having different heat 

stability being at least partially melt-bonded together at points of mutual contact, 
the yarn being melt-bonded at least partially to external surfaces of the article. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, the nonwoven batt being a first layer, 
the article further characterized by a second layer selected from the group 

consisting of 

i) a second nonwoven batt consisting essentially of cellulosic pulp 
fibers bonded together by an adhesive binder, wherein the second 

nonwoven batt consisting essentially of nonwoven cellulosic pulp 
fiber being the same or different than the first batt, and 
ii) a woven, nonwoven, or knitted layer of materials selected from the 
group consisting of viscose rayon, cotton, non-polyolefin synthetic 

fibers, and mixtures thereof, 
 
wherein the first and second layers are mechanically held together by said stitches 

of yarn. 
The absorbent article of claim 2, further characterized by the second 
layer being a second nonwoven batt consisting essentially of cellulosic pulp fibers 

bonded together by an adhesive binder, the second nonwoven batt consisting 
essentially of nonwoven cellulosic pulp fiber being the same or different than the 

first batt.  
 
The absorbent article of claim 2 further characterized by the second 
layer being a woven, nonwoven, or knitted layer of materials selected from the 

group consisting of viscose rayon, cotton, non-polyolefin synthetic fiber, and 
mixtures thereof. 
The absorbent article of claim 1 further characterized by the stitch 
density ranging from 20 to 30 st/10cm.

no greater than 175째C, and a second fiber having a melting temperature of at least 
200째C. 
The absorbent article of claim 2 further characterized by the yarn being 
a first fiber having a melting temperature below that of the cellulosic pulp fiber but 

no greater than 175째C, and a second fiber having a melting temperature of at least 
200째C. 
The absorbent article of claim 4 further characterized by a third layer, 
the third layer being a woven, nonwoven, or knitted layer of materials selected 

from the group consisting of viscose rayon, cotton, non-polyolefin synthetic fibers, 
and mixtures thereof. 
The absorbent article of claim 5 further characterized by the first fiber 
consisting essentially of polyolefin polymers selected from the group consisting of 

branched polyethylene, linear polyethylene, polypropylene, mixtures thereof, and 
copolymers thereof. 
The absorbent article of claim 5 further characterized by the second 
fiber consisting essentially of polymers selected from the group consisting of
