<ABSTRACT>
In a spectacle lens, one surface has at least one area with an approximately constant power, except for aspheric corrections, and at least one transition area with a progressively increasing or diminishing power adjacent to the area with an approximately constant power. The other surface of the lens has an astigmatic effect. The orientation of the surface with astigmatic effect with respect to the surface with progressive power depends on the position of the axis of astigmatism of the eye. This spectacle lens is characterised in that the surface with astigmatic effect has at least one main section whose form differs from the toric form, in a per se known manner, and in that the surface with astigmatic effect is a surface optimised for an axis located at 0 DEG , independently of the orientation of said surface with respect to the surface with progressive power.

Spectacle lens for correcting an astigmatic defect of an eye having an axis
position different from 0°, comprising a face and a surface on the eye side,

whereof

one surface is a progressive surface including least one zone where the
surface power is approximately constant, with the exception of aspheric

corrections, and at least one transitional zone joining said zone of approximately
constant surface power, where the surface power increases

or decreases continuously, and
the other surface is a surface producing an astigmatic effect, with the
orientation of said surface which produces an astigmatic effect, relative to

said progressive surface, being dependent on the position of the astigmatism
axis of the eye,
characterised
 in that the astigmatic surface comprises at least one principal
section varying from the circular shape, whilst it is calculated for this progressive

surface and the position of the 0° axis, such that the angle of view, which
is limited by the iso 0,5 dpt line of the astigmatic defect, will practically not

vary in the event of axis positions different from 0°, and
that this astigmatic surface is turned correspondingly relative to the progressive

surface in the event of axis positions different from 0°.
Spectacle lens according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that no section of the surface producing an astigmatic effect,
which passes through the apex, presents a circular shape. 
Spectacle lens according to any of the Claims 1 or 2,
characterised
 in that said two principal sections of said surface producing
an astigmatic effect are planes of symmetry.
Spectacle lens according to any of the Claims 1 to 3,
characterised
 in that at least the plane of a principal section of said surface
producing an astigmatic effect is not a plane of symmetry.
Method of computing a spectacle lens serving to correct an astigmatic defect
of an eye, and comprising a face and a surface on the eye side, whereof


one surface is a progressive surface including least one zone where the
surface power is approximately constant, with the exception of aspheric

corrections, and at least one transitional zone joining said zone of approximately
constant surface power, where the surface power increases

or decreases continuously, and
the other surface is a surface producing an astigmatic effect, with the
orientation of said surface which produces an astigmatic effect, relative to

said progressive surface, being dependent on the position of the astigmatism
axis of the eye,
characterised
 in that independently of the actual position of the eye axis, a
surface is computed as astigmatic surface which presents at least one principal

section having a shape varying from the circular shape and having a
surface configuration for the "spectacle lens/eye system" and for a progressive

surface determined by an optimising computation for an axis position of

0°,

and in that the astigmatic surface computed for the axis position of 0° is
turned relative to the progressive surface only when the astigmatic surface

computed for the axis position of 0° is turned relative to the progressive surface
only when it is employed for other axis positions. 
Method according to Claim 5,
characterised
 in that said surface producing an astigmatic effect is optimised
for two cones of view.
Method according to Claim 6,
characterised
 in that one of said cones of view corresponds to an excursion
of view by 15 to 20° approximately whilst the other cone of view corresponds

to an excursion of view by 30 to 40° approximately.
Method according to any of the Claims 5 to 7,
characterised
 in that said surface producing an astigmatic effect is optimised
on the basis of an opposite surface producing an almost constant effect,

whereof the effect corresponds to the effect bf a zone producing an almost
constant effect of said surface having a varying surface power.
Method according to any of the Claims 5 to 7, wherein said surface having a
continuously varying surface power comprises, in its upper section, an area

suitable for distance vision or near-seeing vision and, in its lower section, an
area suitable for near-seeing or distance vision, and the zone of continuously

varying surface power between these areas,
characterised
 in that in optimisation along said cones of view the viewing
aperture sites in said distance vision and near-seeing vision areas are

weighted more strongly than the sites in the lateral area.
Method according to Claim 9, wherein said surface having a continuously
varying surface power comprises, in its upper section, an area suitable for

distance vision or near-seeing vision and, in its lower section, an area suitable
for near-seeing or distance vision, and the zone of continuously varying

surface power between these areas,
characterised
 in that in optimisation along said cones of view the viewing
aperture sits in said distance vision and near-seeing vision areas are considered

separately in correspondence with the respective distance of vision.
