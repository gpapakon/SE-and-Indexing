<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a device for cutting and attaching the leading end of a web of a new roll onto a core of a winder. Device, essentially consisting of a cutting means (3) interacting with a means (4) for gripping the web and of a means (5) for attaching an adhesive strip or the like to the cut end of the web and for pressing and attaching the latter and the adhesive strip onto the core (1) of the new roll, characterised in that the cutting means (3) has the form of a caisson (box) (7) for accommodating and guiding a cutter (8) which can be displaced in a slot (8'), the said caisson being mounted on the chassis (9) for guiding the web, arranged with the possibility of tilting, under the action of a jack (ram) (10), in the chassis (11) of the winder (2), the said caisson (7) being displaceable transversely to the direction of advance of the web, its face bearing the slot (8') being turned towards the said web. The invention is more particularly applicable to winding up fragile materials.

Device for cutting and attaching the start of the
web of a new reel to a mandrel (1) of a winding machine

(2), wherein rotary discs (23) for supporting reel-carrier
shafts (24) are mounted on a frame (11), the device being

constituted essentially by a cutting means (3) co-operating
with a clamping means (4) for the web and by a means (5)

for applying an adhesive strip or the like (6) to the cut
end of the web and for pressing and applying the latter and

the adhesive strip (6) to the mandrel (1) of the new reel,
the cutting means (3) being in the form of a casing (7) for

housing and guiding a knife (8), the casing being displaceable
transversely to the direction of unwinding of the web,

which device is characterised in that the clamping means
(4) for the web, co-operating with the cutting means (3),

is constituted in the form of a transverse complementary
plate (20) provided with a slot (21) intended to co-operate

with the end of the knife (8) of the cutting means (3), the
said complementary plate (20) being mounted at the end of

arms (22), pivoting about the axis of the support discs
(23) for the reel-carrier shafts (24) of the winding

machine (2) and actuated in a pivoting movement by means of
synchronised pressure cylinders (25).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the casing (7) is mounted on a frame (9) for guiding

the web, arranged with a possibility of tilting, under the
action of a pressure cylinder (10), in the frame (11) of

the winding machine (2).
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the casing (7) is mounted by its ends in the guide

frame (9) by means of end guiding slides (12), co-operating
by means of small guide wheels (13) with guide rails of the

said frame (9) and is actuated in displacement, 
transversely to the direction of unwinding of the web, by

means of pressure cylinders (14) bearing on the opposite
face of the said casing (7) from that guiding the knife

(8), the said pressure cylinders (14) being mounted on a
support bar (15) of the guide frame (9).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the guide frame (9), being able to be

tilted by the action of the pressure cylinder (10) and
equipped with web return rollers (9'), is pivotally mounted

about the axis (9'') of one of the return rollers (9')
between a retracted position for preparation of the means

(5) for applying the adhesive strip or the like (6),
presenting the cutting means (3) in a horizontal position,

with the knife (8) turned upwards, and a position for
cutting and attaching the cut end of the web substantially

in the vertical, in a plane tangential to the generatrix
described by the axes of the reel-carrier shafts (24)

mounted on the discs (23) of the winding machine (2).
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 4,
characterised in that the winding machine (2) has a number

of clamping means (4) equal to the number of reel-carrier
shafts (24).
Device according to any one of Claims 1, 2 and 4,
characterised in that the guide frame (9) is additionally

provided with a means (26) for locking the web during the
operation of cutting and attaching to the mandrel of the

new reel, the means (26) co-operating with a return roller
(9').
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in
that the locking means (26) is preferably constituted by a

transverse bar (27) mounted so as to be displaceable in a
plane passing through the axis of the corresponding roller

(9'), by way of at least one actuating pressure cylinder
(28), and by a cross-member (29) of the guide frame 9

supporting the said pressure cylinder (28) and transverse
bar (27). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the casing (7) for housing and

guiding the knife (8) of the cutting means (3) is provided
with centring and end of stroke detecting means co-operating

with means of corresponding shape provided on the
ends of the support arms (22) for the complementary plate

(20) forming the clamping means (4).
Device according to Claim 8, characterised in
that the centring and detecting means are constituted in

the form of frustoconical bores opening at their base of
restricted section onto an end of stroke contact and the

means of corresponding shape, provided on the ends of the
support arms (22) for the complementary plate (20), then

contact of the means provided on the casing (7).
Device according to any one of Claims 1, 3, 4, 6

perforated strip (32) for holding the adhesive strip (6) or
the like by means of low pressure, is pivotally mounted in

the tilting frame (9) by means of arms (33) actuated by at

with recesses (39) of corresponding shape provided on the

corresponding end of the low pressure cylinder (31).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 and 11,
characterised in that the recesses (39) are two in number

and are arranged at an angular distance corresponding to 
the linear distance between the median axis of the
