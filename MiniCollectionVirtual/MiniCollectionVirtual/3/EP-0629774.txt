<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal 
combustion engine air intake regulating system. As is known, motor vehicles feature an air intake 
manifold fitted with an air supply regulating valve 
generally a throttle valve - at which is formed a bypass 
conduit for additional air, and the angular position of 
which is user-controlled either directly (accelerator 
pedal) or indirectly (electronic control system 
activated by the accelerator pedal). The bypass conduit 
is in turn fitted with a second valve for regulating air 
supply to the engine independently of the user, and 
which is particularly useful for supplying the engine 
with additional air at idling speed, startup, or when 
the vehicle is "braked" by the engine upon release of 
the accelerator pedal ("dashpot" conditions). Known engine air intake regulating systems provide 
for feedback control of the air supply along the intake 
manifold, i.e. for continuously detecting air supply due 
to the angular position of the throttle, by detecting 
either the air pressure along the intake manifold, or  
 
the electrical resistance of a potentiometer, which is 
closely related to the angular position of the throttle. 
In most known systems, no feedback control is provided 
of the air supply along the bypass conduit, so that no 
information relative to performance and the efficiency 
of the adjustment effected along the bypass is supplied 
to the system controlling the second valve. For example, 
in the case of known systems featuring a step motor for 
controlling the second valve, air supply can only be 
determined by the control system on the basis of the 
steps commanded by it to the step motor. As step motors, 
however, are known, under certain conditions, to "fall 
out of step", thus resulting in a discrepancy - 
"undetected" by the control system - between the number 
of steps commanded and those actually performed, and 
since the additional air supply parameter serves for 
processing further engine control data, any computing 
errors relative to additional air supply obviously 
result in data processing errors. In certain engine air intake regulating systems, 
the additional air supply is feedback-controlled by 
detecting the electrical resistance of a potentiometer, 
which is closely related to the position of the second 
valve. Such systems, however, are expensive to produce, 
mainly due to the cost of the potentiometer, and the 
difficulties posed by suitably seating and assembling 
it. WO 90/07052 discloses a system according to the
