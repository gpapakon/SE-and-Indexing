<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to perfluorocarbon polymer-based 
matrices having a coating of a crosslinked hydrophilic polymer 

such as polyvinyl alcohol. Solid affinity supports prepared 
using such hydrophilic polymer coated perfluorocarbon polymer-based 

supports and their use in affinity separations are also 
provided. The affinity support is based on crosslinked 

hydrophilic polymer coated perfluorocarbon carrier having ligands 
or binders for the ligands attached to its surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inert solid affinity supports exhibiting
low nonspecific binding, comprising perfluorocarbon
polymer-based matrices having a coating of a crosslinked
hydrophilic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol
and their use in affinity
separations.Laboratory and process operations in biotechnology, such as
membrane and chromatographic separations, must frequently be
carried out under conditions which resemble the natural
environment of a host organism. Ionic strength, pH and
temperature are often selected to mimic the in-vivo domain. To
insure maximum stability of biomolecules, exposed surfaces in
process and laboratory apparatus should be very polar or
hydrophilic in order to avoid inactivation and/or adsorption of
biomolecules such as nucleic acids, and proteins, including
enzymes. Adsorption of biomolecules onto exposed surfaces is
highly undesirable in that the process can be irreversible and/or
lead to a loss in biological activity.Although wetting agents such as surfactants and water
miscible organic solvents will typically reduce adsorption, the
effect is generally temporary, particularly where the surface is
exposed to air. Further, the presence of these agents in
solution can lead to foaming and negatively impact biological 
activity by disturbing the tertiary structure of proteins.To avoid hydrophobic adsorption, many practitioners select
hydrophilic materials as supports for membranes or
chromatographic processes. Materials such as cellulose,
acrylamide, polyethyleneimine and agarose are widely used for
this reason. Although possessing the desired low level of
hydrophobic character, these naturally hydrophilic substances can
be deficient in other ways. For example, many of these
hydrophilic substances exhibit low, but finite, solubility in
aqueous solutions. This is a concern in most biological process
operations which generally utilize large volumes of aqueous
fluids. Such solubilization leads to both physical breakdown of
the support matrix and additionally, the potential for
contamination of the end product by the foreign materials
released from the support matrix. The presence of such
contaminants in therapeutic agents is a major concern in
commercial biotechnology as they may cause fever or initiate an
unexpected immune response in the patient.In addition, many hydrophilic materials also exhibit limited
thermal and chemical stability, thus interfering with their use
in procedures for sterilization and endotoxin removal.In contrast, matrices possessing the best thermal,
