<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DNA fragment which is useful 
when protein is produced making use of recombinant DNA 
techniques, a vector containing the DNA fragment, a transformant 
transformed with the vector and a process for the production of 
protein using the transformant. Genetic engineering techniques are commonly used as a means 
for the production of proteins such as physiologically active 
substances and the like. That is, a gene coding for a protein 
of interest is inserted into an appropriate expression vector, 
host cells are transformed with the vector and the protein is 
purified from a cultured mixture of the resulting transformant. 
In recent years, improvements of such techniques have been made 
for more efficient production of protein with increased final 
production yield. For example, when Escherichia coli is used as a host, 
expression level of a protein of interest and its final 
production yield can be increased by using a strong SD sequence 
in order to enhance binding of mRNA to ribosome (J. Shine and L. 
Dalgano; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol.71, p.1342, 1974), 
increasing copy numbers of recombinant DNA molecules per cell 
(R. Nagarajarao and S.G. Rogers; Gene, vol.6, p.247, 1978), 
using strong promoter with the aim of increasing transcription  
 
efficiency (H.A. DeBore, L.J. Comstock and M. Vasser; Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol.80, p.21, 1980) or using a protease 
defective strain (lon‚Åª strain for instance) as a host cell in 
order to prevent hydrolysis of a useful protein of interest by a 
protease which exists in E. coli itself (M.F. Charatte, G.W. 
Henderson and A. Markovitz; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol.78, 
p.4728, 1981: C.H. Chung and A.L. Goldberg; Proc. Natl. Acad. 
Sci. USA, vol.78, p.4931, 1981). On the other hand, processes for the secretion of a protein 
of interest from its host cells into the extracellular milieu 
have already been developed and applied to the production of the 
protein of interest. Such an extracellular secretion can avoid 
decomposition and modification of the protein of interest inside 
the host cells. In addition, since formation of inclusion 
bodies can be avoided, purification of the protein of interest 
can be made easily. Therefore, techniques of extracellular 
secretion of a protein of interest is important for increasing 
production efficiency of the protein by recombinant DNA 
techniques. In order to effect extracellular secretion of a protein of 
interest, it is necessary to express it in the form of an 
intracellular
