<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to the field of
protein-glycosaminoglycan interactions and, more
particularly, to means and compositions for mimicking
the specificity of this interaction.Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are naturally-occurring
carbohydrate-based molecules implicated in regulation
of a number of cellular processes, including blood
coagulation, angiogenesis, tumor growth, nerve cell
development, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and gene
expression, most likely by interaction with effector
molecules. GAG's are linear, non-branched chains of
repeating two-sugar (disaccharide) units which may be
up to 150 units in length, and are well known and
described in the art. See, for example, Jackson et al.
(1991) Physiological Reviews71:481-539 and Kjellen et
al. (1991) Ann. Rev. Biochem.60:443-475. GAG's are
often, but not always, found covalently bound to
protein cores in structures called proteoglycans.
Proteoglycan structures are abundant on cell surfaces 
and are associated with the extracellular matrix around cells.Glycosaminoglycans (also referred to herein and in the art as
"glycans") can be divided into four main classes on the basis of the
repating disaccharide unit in the backbone. Typically, one sugar is a uronic
acid, and the other is either an N-acetylglucosamine or an N-acetylgalactosamine.
The classes are exemplified by the following four
GAGs: (1) heparin sulfate (D-glucuronic acid/N-acetyl- or N-sulfo-D-glucosamine);
(2) chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (D-glucuronic acid or L-iduronic
acid/N-acetyl-D-glactosamine); (3) keratan sulfate (D-galactose/N-acetyl-D-glucosamine),
and (4) hyaluronic acid. All GAG's, with the
exception of hyaluronic acid, contain sulfate groups variously esterified to
the ring hydroxyl group of the sugars. These negatively charged group are
believed to figure prominently in the biological properties attributed to
glycosaminoglycans. The naturally-occurring forms of GAG's, particularly
heparin, heparin sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, in fact are
complex hetero-oligosaccharides composed of mixtures of differentially
sulfated sugar residues.One of the most thoroughly studied glycosaminoglycans is the widely
used anticoagulant heparin. Heparin is a highly sulfated form of heparin
sulfate, which is found in most cells. As a commercial product heparin is
a hetero-oligodisaccharide composition of about 20-60 monomeric units,
having an overall extended length of about 10-30nm (100-300 Å), having
no protein associated with it, and its anticoagulant
