<ABSTRACT>
A programmable logic device having macrocells (53, 40, 55) enables gate cascades between macrocells (51, 56) to occur with a faster signal transit time, while preserving the flip flop function of the cascaded macrocells by reallocating a redirectable flip flop reset product term (42) to the flip flop (47) input. All gate product terms are retained during cascading. The macrocell logic is optimized for fast signal transit with selectable flip flop clocking. Multiplex clocking (64) and programming (CB1, CB2, CB3) are done with fewer transistors in the signal path, further reducing signal transit time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MACROCELL WITH PRODUCT-TERM CASCADE AND IMPROVED FLIP FLOP UTILIZATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the implementation of custom logic functions in an integrated circuit logic device and more specifically to cascading of product terms.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART There is a need for flexibility and speed in integrated circuit design. In response, a class of integrated circuits (I.C. 's) known as Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) was developed. PLDs enable the designer to custom program arbitrary logical functions in an I.C. chip, according relative ease and flexibility in testing prototypes and making design changes. Xilinx, Inc. the assignee of the present invention, manufactures PLDs, the architecture of which is shown in Fig. 1 including an array of configurable logic blocks 1, 2, 3, 4 interconnected via a universal interconnect matrix (UIM) 5. The input lines 6 into logic block 1 are programmably combined into a number of AND gates 7 in the AND array 8. The output lines 9 provide product terms. Product terms 9 of each AND gate 7 of the AND array 8 are provided to one of a series of macrocells 10 in each logic block. Architecture of a typical macrocell 10 is shown in Fig. 2. Macrocell 10 configures the outputs of AND array 8 of Fig. 1 and may perform additional logic on the output signals of AND array 8. Macrocell 10 contains an OR gate 11 into which product terms are gated, and a flip flop 12 for storing the output signal of OR gate 11. Output line 13 of OR gate 11 and the output lines 13a and 13b of flip flop 12 can be 

configured programmably by setting the multiplexers (MUXs) 14, 15 and 16 with configuration bits on their control terminals, each specifying the output state of the respective MUX. The macrocell of Fig. 2 advantageously provides a relatively large count (eight) of product terms 11.1 per macrocell, but is inefficient in macrocell usage. The disadvantage is that a fixed product term count is not flexible enough to handle the product term count variability that arises. User product term requirements for a logic function can vary widely, anywhere from one to sixteen product terms or more, depending on the complexity of the logic function. Single product term functions are quite common. For logic functions requiring less than eight product terms in the macrocell of Fig. 2, the unused product terms are wasted. For functions requiring more than eight product terms, the function must be split up into two or more subfunctions, each of which can be implemented with
