Hydraulic device for lymphatic drainage and massage of a part 
(1) of the human body, the device comprising an enclosure (2) capable of 

covering said part of the body, and in which a fluid (3) circulates throughout 
its volume, being subjected to headloss tied in particular to the flow rate and 

to the pressure of the fluid at the inlet (5) of sad enclosure, which enclosure 
(2) comprises zones capable of covering the entire surface of said part (1) 

of the body, the device being characterized in that said enclosure (2) is 
undeformable locally under the sole effect of the pressure 
p
 at which said 
fluid (3) circulates spatially in the desired massage direction, which 

enclosure is filled with a porous medium (4) of given low permeability, 
determined as a function of the section of the circulation volume of the fluid 

(3) and of which the headloss characteristic imposed to the fluid in each 
zone of said enclosure (2) is linearly continuous in the fluid circulation 

direction. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said fluid (3) is 
a fluid of high viscosity, and is determined as a function of the section of its 

circulation volume inside the enclosure (2) and of its adhesion against the 
walls along which it circulates. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 2, characterized in 
that said enclosure (2) comprises a practically rigid outside wall (7) and a 

flexible inside wall (8) that cover said part of the body (1) to which it 
transmits the pressure 
p
 of the fluid (3). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the outside wall (7) of the enclosure (2) is premolded to the shape of 

said part of the body (1). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the outside wall (7) of the enclosure (2) is externally deformable by any 

means, in order to modify the section of the inside volume through which 
the fluid (3) circulates at given points. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that it comprises pressure sensors (9) inside said enclosure (2), connected 

to an external central unit (10) that compares the recorded pressures (pi) 
with set reference values, determined beforehand as a function of the 

desired type of massage, and that enable the flow rate and the pressure at  
 

the fluid inlet (5) into the enclosure (2) to be regulated so as to obtain said 
reference values. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that said enclosure (2) comprises intermediate outlet orifices (19) for the 

fluid (3), which orifices may be very localized on special zones to be treated 
by a local pressure variation effect, or may cover a more extended zone 

such as around a complete circumference of a cylindrical enclosure for a 
limb. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that said enclosure (2) may comprise intermediate inlet orifices (19) for the 

fluid (3), which orifices may be localized in special treatment zones. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that said porous medium (4) is constituted of laminated layers. 
Hydraulic device for the massage and lymphatic drainage of a 
part (1) of the human body, characterized in that it comprises different 

separate enclosures (2) according to any one of claims 1 to 9, placed one 
behind the others, for treating said part of the body.
