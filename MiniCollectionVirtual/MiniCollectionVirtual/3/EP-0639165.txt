<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic composite material comprises matrix and possibly reinforcing materials and intermediate weak interface material and is particularly intended for being used at temperatures above 1400  DEG C and in an oxidizing environment, the matrix and possibly reinforcing materials consisting of the same or different ceramic oxides having a melting point above 1600  DEG C. In order to obtain said ceramic composite material the invention suggests that the interface material consists of one or more ceramic oxides not exhibiting solid solubility, eutecticum below the temperature of manufacture or use or reactivity with any of the matrix or possibly reinforcing materials and in combination with said materials providing a stress field liable to micro-cracking, said matrix and possibly reinforcing materials essentially being substantially pure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a ceramic composite 
material comprising matrix, reinforcing materials 
and an intermediate weak interface material and particularly 
adapted for use at temperatures above 1400°C and in 
oxidizing environment, said matrix and possibly reinforcing 
materials consisting of the same or different ceramic oxides 
having a melting point above 1600°C. Ceramic composite materials might be divided into 
materials reinforced by particles, whiskers or elongated 
fibres. Said materials are prepared by powder processes 
and sintering or by gas-phase infiltration. The materials 
hitherto mentioned in the literature often are based on the 
provision of desired composite characteristics by means of a 
weak interface material between the matrix and the reinforcing 
material, preferably fibres, said interface material 
consisting of carbon or boron nitride, see e.g. Frety, N., 
Boussuge, M., "Relationship between high-temperature 
development of fibre-matrix interfaces and the mechanical 
behaviour of SiC-SiC composites", Composites Sci. Techn. 37 
177-189 (1990) and Singh, R.N., "Influence of high temperature 
exposure on mechanical properties of zircon-silicon 
carbide composites", J. Mater. Sci. 26 117-126 (1991), 
respectively. Both carbon and boron nitride have a layered 
structure which makes them weak in one direction and this 
can be utilized for deflecting cracks along the interface 
between fibre and matrix. Both carbon and boron nitride, 
however, are very sensitive to oxidation which starts already 
at relatively low temperatures of about 500-800°C. In 
order to enable the use of ceramic composites at high temperatures 
in oxidizing atmosphere, such as in combustion 
chambers of gas turbines, rocket nozzles etc. other oxidation-resistent 
weak interface materials are required. An  
 
attempt to provide such materials has been mentioned in 
Carpenter, H.W., Bohlen, J.W., "Fiber coatings for ceramic 
matrix composites", Ceram. Eng. Sci. Proc. vol 13 9-10 
(1992). In said attempt composites have been manufactured 
with SiC fibres and a layered SiC interface in an SiC matrix. 
Experiments also have been made with interfaces of a 
porous oxide in a SiC/SiC composite. However, SiC is stable 
in an oxidizing environment only up to 1000°C, at higher 
temperatures a SiO2 layer always is formed on the surface in 
oxidizing atmosphere. Often SiO2 is not stable together with 
other oxides but reacts therewith and forms strong bonds to 
adjacent materials. Therefore, SiO2 does not

debonding between the interface material and the matrix 

material and/or the reinforcing fibres, respectively, the 
interface material has been applied as a coating on the 

fibres and that said interface material consists of one or more ceramic oxides not exhibiting

A composite material according to claim 1,

 that a beneficial stress field for 
enhancing the debonding has been formed either by differences 

in thermal expansion coefficient between the interface 
material and the matrix and reinforcing fibres or between 

various inherent phases in the very interface material; or 
by the latter as such having anisotropic structure with 

different thermal expansion coefficient in different crystal 
directions; or by providing a phase conversion between the 

phases of the interface material and hence a volume change 
or by the interface material being a composite having at 

least two phases which have different elastic characteristics 
or different thermal expansion coefficients. 
A composite material according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in
 that the combination fibre/interface 
material/matrix material is selected from the group
