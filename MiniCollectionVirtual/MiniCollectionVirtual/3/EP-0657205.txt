<ABSTRACT>
A process for the removal of at least one component 
of a liquid mixture basically comprises directing the 

liquid mixture (10) against the feed side of a membrane 
(25) and directing a condensable vapor sweep stream (32) 

past the permeate side of the membrane (25) in a manner 
such that the flow of the condensable vapor sweep stream 

(32) is substantially countercurrent to the flow of the 
liquid mixture (10), thereby transporting at least a 

portion of at least one component of the liquid mixture 
(10) from the feed side to the permeate side of the 

membrane (25) to form a combined permeate side mixture (34) 
of condensable vapor and at least one transported 

component.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pervaporation is a membrane-based process that 
can be used to remove a vaporizable component from a 
liquid mixture. In an example of such a process, water 
containing low concentrations of at least one organic 
compound is fed at essentially ambient pressure to the 
feed side of a membrane, while a vacuum pump or a gaseous 
sweep stream maintains a sufficiently low partial pressure 
of the organic compound on the permeate side of the 
membrane to provide a chemical potential gradient of the 
organic compound across the membrane. The organic 
compound and some of the water vaporize from the permeate 
side of the membrane to form a vapor-phase permeate. One problem commonly associated with 
pervaporation is economically providing and maintaining 
the chemical potential gradient across the membrane. 
Those pervaporation processes employing a vacuum pump or 
condenser to provide the necessary chemical potential 
gradient are energy-intensive and thus expensive to operate. 
As the concentration of the organic compound in the 
feed stream is reduced to low levels, the partial pressure 
of the vaporizable organic compound in the permeate 
stream must be kept even lower for permeation and therefore 
separation to take place. If a vacuum pump is used 
to maintain the difference in partial pressure of the 
organic compound in equilibrium with the liquid feed 
stream and the partial pressure of the vaporizable 
organic compound in the vapor-phase permeate, the pump 
must maintain a very high vacuum, thus incurring high 
capital and operating costs. Similarly, if a condenser 
is used, extremely low temperatures must be maintained, 
requiring a costly and complicated refrigeration system. A noncondensable sweep gas has been used to 
provide the driving force for the transport of vaporizable 
components across a pervaporation membrane.  
 
Although such a practice eliminates the vacuum pump-related 
problems associated with pervaporation, it 
introduces other problems associated with separating the 
condensable permeate from the noncondensable sweep gas. 
See, for example, Hoover et al., 10 J. Memb. Sci. 253 
(1982). Lee et al., in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,933,198, 
5,013,447 and 5,143,526, disclose a process for treating 
alcoholic beverages by pervaporation using a noncondensable 
sweep gas or vacuum. Although the sweep gas streams 
disclosed by Lee et al. may comprise water or ethanol, 
conditions in the sweep gas stream are controlled to 
ensure that these components are present only as 
noncondensable gas vapors and
