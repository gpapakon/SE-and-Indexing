<ABSTRACT>
In wide-span soil-working appliances with a working width of 8 m and above, it is necessary to fold the implement carrier together for road travel to a maximum width of 3 m and a transport height of a maximum of 4 m. This is achieved by means of the invention by the use of a folding-arm arrangement (48) with a telescopic supporting-arm arrangement (49,50) which is pivotable about a middle frame (43) by means of a working cylinder (45). The boom arm (43) is fixedly connected to the supporting-arm arrangement (49,50) and, during the pivoting from the vertical position of rest into the horizontal operating position, is displaced radially outwards together with the movable telescopic tube (50). A connecting rod (56) of fixed length, which is arranged in an articulated manner between the middle frame (43) and the boom arm (53) and the fixed point of articulation of which is arranged at a distance from the mid-axis which is greater than the distance of the pivoting point of the telescopic arrangement, executes the linear movement in conjunction with the extension of the telescopic arrangement.

Tool carrier for soil working or soil treating machines, having a frame
with a minimum working width of approximately 8 m, reducible for road

travel to a width of up to max 3 m and a transportation height of up to
max 4 m, in which a horizontal central carrier (1; 41) is firmly connected

to a central frame (6-10; 43) and in which a support arm arrangement (18,
19; 48) is so coupled to a working cylinder (28, 29; 45) that the support

arm arrangement and therefore the tool carrier can be moved from the
vertical position for road travel into the horizontal, extended working

position, wherein

a) to the left and right to the outside an extension (2, 3; 42) is
connected to the central carrier (1; 41), said central carrier (1; 41)

and the bilateral extensions (2, 3; 42) together having a maximum
length of 3 m,
b) to the central frame (6-10; 43) a hinged arm arrangement (13, 14; 48)
with a telescopic support arm arrangement (18, 19; 49, 50) is pivotably

fixed (at 11, 12; 51) and is connected horizontally to the extension
(2, 3; 42) in the working position and
c) the telescopic support arm arrangement (18, 19; 49, 50) comprises a
fixed carrier (20, 21; 49) of fixed length and a carrier (22, 23; 50)

connected thereto and displaceable with respect thereto, as well as
having a tool carrier or cantilever arm (15, 16; 53) firmly connected

to and arranged parallel to the longitudinally displaceable carrier
(22, 23; 50),

characterized in that
d) between the extension (2, 3, 42) of the central carrier (41) and the
tool carrier or cantilever arm (53) there is in each case a flexibly

mounted connection (54, 55, 56) of fixed length and that
e) between a bearing point (44) of the central frame (43) and a bearing
point (46) of the fixed length telescopic carrier (49) is articulated

a working cylinder (45), which pivots the hinged arm arrangement (48)
together wit
h the cantilever arm (53) about a pivot point (50) from the
vertical inoperative position into the horizontal working position.
Tool carrier according to claim 1, characterized in that a push rod
(56) is articulated between the tool carrier or cantilever arm (53) and the

extension of the central carrier (41) (at 54, 55). 
Tool carrier according to claim 1, characterized in that the fixed
length telescopic carrier (49) concentrically surrounds the displacement

telescopic carrier (50) and that the displaceable telescopic carrier (50) is
guided in the fixed length telescopic carrier (49).
Tool carrier according to claim 2, characterized in that the fixed
length telescopic carrier (49) has an elongated slot, in which is guided

the displaceable telescopic carrier (50) with the connecting piece (52).
Tool carrier according to one of the claims 3 or 4, characterized in
that the stationary pivot point (51) of the hinged arm arrangement (48) is

positioned with a spacing (a) from the central axis and the stationary
pivot point (55) of the push rod (56) with a spacing (b) from the central

axis, the spacing (b) being larger than the spacing (a).
