<DESCRIPTION>
 ALLERGENIC PROTEINS AND PEPTIDES FROM JAPANESE CEDARPOLLENBackground of the InventionGenetically predisposed individuals, who make up about 10% of the population, become hypersensitized (allergic) to antigens from a variety of environmental sources to which they are exposed. Those antigens that can induce immediate and/or delayed types of hypersensitivity are known as allergens. (King, T.P., AJv. Immunol. 23: 77-105, (1976)). Anaphylaxis or atopy, which includes the symptoms of hay fever, asthma, and hives, is one form of immediate allergy. It can be caused by a variety of atopic allergens, such as products of grasses, trees, weeds, animal dander, insects, food, drugs, and chemicals.The antibodies involved in atopic allergy belong primarily to the IgE class of immunoglobulins. IgE binds to mast cells and basophils. Upon combination of a specific allergen with IgE bound to mast cells or basophils, the IgE may be cross-linked on the cell surface, resulting in the physiological effects of IgE-antigen interaction. These physiological effects include the release of, among other substances, histamine, serotonin, heparin, a chemotactic factor for eosinophilic leukocytes and/or the leukotrienes, C4, D4, and E4, which cause prolonged constriction of bronchial smooth muscle cells (Hood, L.E. et al. Immunology (2nd ed.), The Benjamin/Cumming Publishing Co., Inc. (1984)). These released substances are the mediators which result in allergic symptoms caused by a combination of IgE with a specific allergen. Through them, the effects of an allergen are manifested. Such effects may be systemic or local in nature, depending on the route by which the antigen entered the body and the pattern of deposition of IgE on mast cells or basophils. Local manifestations generally occur on epithelial surfaces at the location at which the allergen entered the body. Systemic effects can include anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock), which is the result of an IgE-basophil response to circulating (intravascular) antigen. 

 Japanese cedar (Sugi; Cryptomeria japonica) pollinosis is one of the most important allergic diseases in Japan. The number of patients suffering from this disease is on the increase and in some areas, more than 10% of the population are affected. Treatment of Japanese cedar pollinosis by administration of Japanese cedar pollen extract to effect hyposensitization to the allergen has been attempted. Hyposensitization using Japanese cedar pollen extract, however, has drawbacks in that it can elicit anaphylaxis if high doses
