<ABSTRACT>
Selective items showing a plurality of functions are 
displayed on a display of a television. An angular velocity 

sensor is mounted on a transmitter to detect an angular 
velocity about its longitudinal axis. The resulting angular 

velocity is converted into a control signal, which is 
transmitted to a receiver from the transmitter. That is, by 

rotating the transmitter about its longitudinal axis, a 
cursor is moved and the desired selective item is selected. 

A selected function is executed by pressing on execution 
switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a remote control 
system, and particularly to a remote control system used for 
selecting selective items displayed on, for example, a 
display. In a television and the like adopting a remote control 
system, functions such as ON and OFF of a power switch, a 
selection of channels, a volume control and so on are 
controlled by a control signal sent from a transmitter. The 
control signal from the transmitter is sent mainly by 
pressing an operating button. However, when the functions 
added to the television and the like increase, the operating 
button of the transmitter also increases to deteriorate the 
operability. In order to solve such a defect, for example, as shown 
in Fig. 3, a system using a three-dimensional mouse for 
controlling is considered. In such system, for example, 
selective items 2 showing the functions are displayed on a  
 
display 1 in a matrix. For selecting the selective items 2, 
movements of the transmitter 3 is utilized. On the 
transmitter 3, two angular velocity sensors are mounted to 
detect a rotation x about a perpendicular axis and a 
rotation y about a horizontal axis. When the rotation x 
about the perpendicular axis is detected, the control signal 
corresponding to the rotation is sent to a receiver 4 from 
the transmitter 3, and the lateral selective items 2 are 
selected by a cursor 5. When the rotation y about the 
horizontal axis is detected, the control signal 
corresponding to the rotation is sent to the receiver 4 from 
the transmitter 3, and the vertical selective items 2 are 
selected by the cursor 5. That is, when the transmitter 3 is moved laterally, the 
cursor 5 moves on the selective items 2 laterally, and when 
the transmitter 3 is moved vertically, the cursor 5 moves on 
the selective items 2 vertically. As such, by moving the 
transmitter laterally and vertically, any selective items 2 
displayed on the display can be selected. When the 
selective item 2 is selected, by pressing an execution 
button, the selected function is executed. In such remote control system, however, since the 
transmitter is moved laterally or vertically, if a volume of 
the movement is large, sometimes the control signal from the 
transmitter deviates from a receiving range of the receiver.  
 
Since the transmitter is operated by hand, there is the 
possibility that the selected selective item may change due 
to an unsteady operation. Furthermore, since it is 
necessary to detect the rotations about the two axes in this 
system, at least,
