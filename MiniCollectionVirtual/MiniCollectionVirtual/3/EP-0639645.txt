<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing trehalose from inexpensive 
saccharide raw materials via an enzymic method uses stable 

enzymes with high productivity. The process includes 
incubating a saccharide raw material and an inorganic 

phosphoric acid and/or a salt thereof in the presence of 
phosphorylase to produce α -glucose 1-phosphate, and 

contacting the produced α -glucose 1-phosphate with glucose in 
the presence of a trehalose phosphorylase to produce trehalose. 

The isolation and purification of trehalose is easier in 
comparison to conventional fermentation methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing trehalose. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a process for producing trehalose by use of 
inexpensive saccharide raw materials and stable enzymes with 
high productivity via an enzymic method wherein the isolation 
and purification of the end product are easier in comparison 
with fermentation methods. Recently, attention has been given to various 
oligosaccharides and efforts are being made to develop their 
use. Trehalose is a disaccharide widely distributed in animals, 
plants and microorganisms. It is proposed that trehalose be 
utilized as sweetening agents (Published Unexamined Japanese 
Patent Application No. 240758/1988), and agents for protecting 
proteins from drying (Published Unexamined Japanese Patent 
Application No. 500562/1988). It is known that there are extraction methods, which 
make use of the natural sources of trehalose listed above. 
There are also microbiological fermentation methods, which make 
use of yeasts, Arthrobacter, Nocardia or the like. The known 
methods in the prior art, however, are minimally productive and 
not industrially feasible because they require complicated 
operations in the separation and purification of the desired 
saccharide products. An enzymic method, in which trehalose is produced from 
maltose via β-glucose 1-phosphate, is disclosed in Japanese  
 
Patent Publication No. 60998/1988. This method, however, has 
disadvantages in view of the cost of maltose as well as the 
cost and availability of maltose phosphorylase. In addition, 
trehalose phosphorylase, which catalyzes the formation of 
trehalose from β-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, lacks 
stability. Further, Euglena (green algae), the source of the 
trehalose phosphorylase, is not easy to culture. Another enzymic method, in which trehalose is produced 
from α-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose around pH 7 in the 
presence of a trehalose phosphorylase obtained from Flammulinavelutipes, is disclosed in FEMS Microbiology Letters, 55, 
147-150 (1988). The trehalose phosphorylase from Flammulinavelutipes, however, lacks stability, making its preparation 
rather difficult. The enzyme cannot sustain its activity at 
the temperature range necessary for industrial operations for 
an extended period of time. It therefore is concluded that 
the trehalose phosphorylase from Flammulinavelutipes is not 
applicable to industrial use. In short, although fermentation and enzymic methods are 
known in the prior art for producing trehalose
