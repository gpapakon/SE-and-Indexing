<ABSTRACT>
Novel point of joining sheet-metal blanks by cold flow, of the type in which a circular cavity (7a, 8a) is made simultaneously in two blanks (7 and 8) by means of a punch and a die, the said cavities (7a, 8a) being thus housed one in the other and having, in the vicinity of the bottom, a widened part (7c, 8c), characterised in that the bottom of the said cavities has at least one boss (7b, 8b) extending towards the inside of the cavities (7a, 8a).

<CLAIMS>
A tool for making connecting points for sheet metal
blanks by cold flowing consisting in making

simultaneously in two sheet metal blanks (7, 8, 7a, 8a,
7b, 8b, 7m, 8m), by means of a punch and a die, a

circular cavity (7a, 8a, 7i, 8i, 7n, 8n), the cavities
(7a, 8a, 7i, 8i, 7n, 8n) being housed in one another and

having, in the vicinity of the base, an enlargement (7c,
8c, 7j, 8j, 7p, 8p), the said tool being of the type

comprising a punch (5, 5a), a holding-down device (6,
6g) and a lower tool (26, 117, 131, 150) having an anvil

(28, 102, 141, 152) and supporting a die (3, 32, 111,
130) formed of at least two complementary shells (20, 23,

20a, 23a, 112, 115, 133) moveable on a guide surface (25,
116, 132, 151) of the lower tool (26, 117, 131, 150)

against the action of means (33, 119, 137, 139) tending
to bring them closer together, stops being provided to

limit their spacing, the complementary shells (20, 23,
20a, 23a, 112, 115, 133) being mounted sliding on the

guide surface (25, 116, 132, 151) in two opposite
directions and disposed in a cage (34, 34a, 122, 134)

integral with the lower tool (26, 117, 131, 150),
characterised in that
 the said cage (34, 34a, 122, 134)
is pierced by guide holes (35, 135) for guide studs (31,

31a, 120, 136) integral with the said shells (20, 23,
20a, 23a, 112, 115, 133) and sliding in the said guide

holes (35, 135).
A tool for making connecting points, according to Claim
1,
characterised in that
 it comprises four shells (20, 21,
22, 23; 21a, 22a, 23a; 112, 113, 114, 115), with two

opposite shells sliding in two opposite directions,
whereas the two other opposite shells slide in opposite 

directions perpendicular to those of the first opposite
shells.
A tool for making connecting points according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the means tending to bring the
shells (133) closer together are formed by jets of

compressed air directed against the outer surface of the
said shells (133).
A tool for making connecting points according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 it comprises detection means (125,
126) to verify that the displacement of the shells (20,

23; 20a, 23a; 112, 115, 133) during the formation of the
connecting point corresponds to a predetermined setting.
