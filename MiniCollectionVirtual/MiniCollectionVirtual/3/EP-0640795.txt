<ABSTRACT>
A combustion apparatus comprising a nozzle (11) for ejecting flammable fuel retained 
in a fuel container (5) through a valve (13), and a flow rate control means (19) 

upstream of said valve (13), said means (19) having a thread (19b) comprising a 
plurality of fibers (22) and/or a plurality of capillaries (24) and a fuel impenetrable 

member (19a) arranged around the thread (19b), whereby in use fuel from the fuel 
container (5) is supplied to the valve (13) by the capillarity of and/or clearences 

between the fibres (22) and/or capillaries (24) of the thread (19b), and wherein said 
fibers (22) and capillaries (24) are selected from one or more types of the group 

consisting of synthesized fibers, metal fibers, carbon fibers, glass fibers and hollow 
threads or fibers is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustion 
apparatus which burns flammable fuel, such as a gas 
lighter, and is equipped with flow rate regulating means 
for regulating the flow rate of the flammable fuel, and, 
more particularly, to a combustion apparatus whose 
assumability and workability are improved and which can 
ensure stable combustion. Combustion apparatuses which burn flammable fuel 
include a lighter, various types of ignition devices, a 
portable hot plate and a lamp, for example. Among them is 
a lighter equipped with flow rate regulating means for 
regulating the flow rate of ejected flammable fuel, and 
lighters of this type are disclosed in, for example, 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication Nos. 50613/1988 and 
21092/1988 and Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication 
Nos. 18852/1991 and 35969/1991. The lighter in the 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 21092/1988 is 
illustrated in FIG. 12. This lighter has a lighter body 
101 with a cylindrical pocket portion 103 formed in the 
lighter body 101. The interior of the lighter body 101 
around the outer surface of the pocket portion 103 serves 
as a fuel tank 105. This fuel tank 105 is filled with 
flammable fuel.  A valve body portion 107 of is securely retained in 
the pocket portion 103 by means of a hinge structure. A 
valve burner 109 is attached inside this body portion 107 
in such a way as to be movable in the up and down 
direction in the diagram. A packing 111 is located at the 
bottom end portion of this valve burner 109. Those valve 
burner 109 and packing 111 are normally urged downward in 
the diagram by a coil spring 113, the packing 111 pressed 
against a valve seat 115. The valve seat 115 is formed at 
the top end of a cylindrical member 117. A passage 119 is 
formed in the center portion of this cylindrical member 
117, and its lower end defining space 121. A support member 123 is located under the cylindrical 
member 117, with depressurizing means 125 intervening 
between the cylindrical member 117 and the support member 
123. This depressurizing means 125 is the so-called flow rate 
regulating means which comprises a semi-porous film 125a 
and a porous film 125b closely placed on the semi-porous 
film 125a. The semi-porous film 125a has holes with a radius of 
20 to 500 angstroms, and is made from, for example, 
stretchable polyolefin, particularly, polypropylene or 
polyethlene. The flammable fuel in the fuel tank 105 flows into 
the space 121 and the passage 119 while being 
depressurized by or under the
