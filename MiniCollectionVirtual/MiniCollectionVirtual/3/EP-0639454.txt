<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for holding a printing plate on a plate cylinder in a printing machine and to a printing machine containing such a device. The printing plate (9), which is held by a front edge (end edge 24) on the outer circumferential surface (8) of the plate cylinder (1), is otherwise held by means of a rear end fold (26) being hooked onto a hook (165) which can be moved relative to the plate cylinder (1) between a front end position in which it forms a projection on the outer circumferential surface (8) to allow the rear end fold (26) to be hooked on or unhooked, and a retracted position in which it is retracted relative to said outer circumferential surface (8) and holds the printing plate (9) under stress in a state wrapped over the outer circumferential surface (8). This facilitates assembly and demounting of a printing plate. Gaps in printing are reduced to a minimum.
