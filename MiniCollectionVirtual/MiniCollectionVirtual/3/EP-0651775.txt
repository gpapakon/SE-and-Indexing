<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to polymer compositions and 
processes. Processes in which poly hydroxyalkanoates especially 
hydroxybutyric acid polymers and copolymers, for example 
copolymers of hydroxybutyric acid and hydroxyvaleric acid are 
microbially produced and separated from the microorganisms for 
use as plastics materials, are known, for example from European 
Patents 69,497 and 52,459. Polymers produced in this way are difficult to separate 
completely from other organic matter derived from the 
microorganisms and such organic matter may cause discoloration 
of the polymer and/or impart an objectionable odour to the 
polymer during melt processing. We have found that if the melt processing is carried out 
in the presence of a temperature stable sulphite salt, 
preferably an acid sulphite salt, the colour and/or odour of 
the processed polymer is better than when it is absent. The invention comprises a plastics composition which 
comprises a microbially produced hydroxyalkanoic acid polymer 
and a temperature stable sulphite salt. The polymer preferably comprises at least 50% and 
preferably at least 90% of hydroxyalkanoic acid residues by 
weight and more preferably comprises substantially only 
hydroxyalkanoic acid residues. The hydroxyalkanoic acid 
residues suitably contain 4 to 12 carbon atoms and may be for 
example hydroxybutyric and/or hydroxyvaleric acid residues. By temperature stable is meant a salt which is 
sufficiently stable for an effective amount to be present after 
the composition has been raised to a temperature at which it is 
melt processed. It is believed that the salt reacts with 
impurities when the polymer is in the molten state, thereby 
achieving the desired results. In general, compounds of which 
at most 10% decompose when exposed to a temperature of about  
 
150°C for a period of 0.5 - 10 minutes can be expected to be 
satisfactory when melt processing is to take place in the range 
170 to 210°C. The sulphite is preferably an alkali metal for example a 
lithium or preferably sodium or potassium sulphite salt, and is 
more preferably an alkali metal acid sulphite for example 
sodium bisulphite. The quantity of sulphite salt required depends on the 
amounts and character of the impurities present, on the nature 
of the salt and its stability (which influences the amounts 
present at melt processing temperatures). However, 
concentrations equivalent to 0.1 to 1% and preferably 0.1 to 
0.5% by weight of sulphur present in the form of sulphite are 
in general suitable. The
