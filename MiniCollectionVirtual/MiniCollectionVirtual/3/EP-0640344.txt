<ABSTRACT>
The active compound ursodeoxycholic acid has proven therapeutically effective inter alia for the treatment of cholestatic liver disorders in children. A problem in the administration of this active compound, a bile acid, to children is its extreme bitterness. A liquid dosage form for ursodeoxycholic acid which is acceptable as regards taste and has a sufficiently high active compound concentration is described. The liquid to be taken is a suspension prepared with addition of a swelling or thickening agent, which contains the active compound mainly in finely crystalline form as a disperse phase and only to a significantly lower amount dissolved in the aqueous dispersing agent. Residual bitterness which still remains can be additionally masked by addition of  beta -cyclodextrin, or suitable flavour correctants.

<CLAIMS>
Medicament in a liquid administration form containing ursodeoxycholic
acid as the active agent, particularly for the treatment

of cholestatic hepatic diseases in infants, characterized in that
the liquid to be taken is a suspension prepared accompanied by the

addition of a swelling and/or thickening agent, which contains the
active agent mainly in a finely crystalline form as the disperse

phase and only in a much smaller proportion dissolved in the aqueous
dispersant.
Medicament according to claim 1, characterized in that over
99%, preferably 99.4%, of the fine crystalline active agent has

a nucleus size smaller than 90 µm.
Medicament according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that demineralized water is used as the dispersant.
Medicament according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the swelling or thickening agent is a microcrystalline

cellulose, which is dispersible in water and which contains a proportion
of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as the protective colloid

and is present in a quantity range of 0.005 to 0.03 g/ml.
Medicament according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the suspension additionally contains β-cyclodextrin

as the taste masking agent for the active agent dissolved in the
dispersant.
Medicament according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the suspension
 additionally contains as preservatives
methylparaben and/or propylparaben and/or benzoic acid and/or sorbic

acid.
