<ABSTRACT>
The printed products (33) to be pressed run in an imbricated formation (S), in which the folding edges (33a) of the printed products (33) are on top, through between the press rollers (3, 4, 5, 6) of two pairs of press rollers (1, 2) arranged in succession. The upper press rollers (3, 5) of each pair of press rollers (1, 2), which come into contact directly with the folding edges (33a), are fixedly mounted. Opposite these, the other press rollers (4, 6) of each pair of press rollers (1, 2) are mounted on each side in a common mounting (15) supported flexibly on pneumatic springs (16). The press rollers (3, 4, 5, 6) are driven individually via elastic drive belts (17, 18, 19, 20). As a result of these measures, the printed products (33) can be pressed perfectly and with care, even at a high conveying speed.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for pressing folded printed products (33) fed in an overlapping 
array (S), such as newspapers, magazines and parts thereof, with a first pair (1) 

of rotatably mounted pressing rolls (3, 4) which between them define a gap (7) 
for the printed products (33) to pass through and of which the one, first pressing 

roll (3) has a fixed mounting and the other, second pressing roll (4) of the pair is 
deflectable away from the first pressing roll (3) and transversely with respect to 

the conveying direction (F) of the printed products (33) against the action of an 
elastic restoring force (16), and with a second pair (2) of rotatably mounted 

pressing rolls (5, 6) which are arranged adjacent to the first pressing roll pair (1) 
and, viewed in the conveying direction (F) of the printed products (33), 

downstream of the first pressing roll pair (1), and which likewise between them 
define a gap (8) for the printed products (33) to pass through, the one, first 

pressing roll (5) of this second pair having a fixed mounting and the other, 
second pressing roll (6) of the pair being deflectable away from the first pressing 

roll (5) and transversely with respect to the conveying direction (F) of the printed 
products (33) against the action of an elastic restoring force (16), wherein the 

first, fixedly mounted pressing rolls (3, 5) of both pressing roll pairs (1, 2) are 
arranged on the same side of the path defined by the gaps (7, 8) for the printed 

products (33), characterized in that to guide the printed products (33), presented 
with a folded edge (33a), which extends at right angles to the conveying direction 

(F), leading in the said conveying direction, to the gap (7) between the pressing 
rolls (3, 4) of the first pressing roll pair (1), at least one first circulating, elastic, 

extensible guide element (29) is guided from a first deflection pulley (21) 
mounted ahead of the first pressing roll (3) of the first pressing roll pair (1) at 

least over this first pressing roll (3) of the first pressing roll pair (1), and at least one 
second circulating, elastic, extensible guide element (30) is guided from a second 

deflection pulley (22) mounted ahead of the second pressing roll (4) of the first 
pressing roll pair (1) at least over this second pressing roll (4) of the first pressing  

 
roll pair (1), and in that each pressing roll (3, 4, 5, 6) is driven by at least one 

endless driving element (17, 18, 19, 20) made of elastic, extensible material which 
is guided over a drive pulley (21, 22, 23, 24). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the drive pulleys (21, 
22, 23, 24) are in driving engagement with an endless drive member (37), 

preferably a toothed belt provided with toothing on both sides, driven in circulation 
by a drive (36). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the first guide 
element (29) is also guided over the first pressing roll (5) of the second pressing 

roll pair (2) and the second guide element (30) is also guided over the second 
pressing roll ([6]
) of the second pressing roll pair (2), in each case with a section 
(29a, 30a) of the guide element (29, 30) spanning the interval (31, 32) between the 

first pressing rolls (3, 5) and the interval between the second pressing rolls (4, 6), 
respectively, of the pressing roll pairs (1, 2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that the guide elements (29, 
30) are formed as long coil springs consisting of helically coiled wire (52). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
second pressing rolls (4, 6) of each pressing roll pair (1, 2) are supported on 

pneumatic springs (16). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in that the second pressing 
rolls (4, 6) at each end are moun
ted in a common bearing part (60, 61) supported 
on a pneumatic spring (16).  

 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized by an 
adjusting device (69) which acts on the bearings (58, 59, 61, 62) of the second 

pressing rolls (4, 6) of the pressing roll pairs (1, 2) to set the size of the gaps (7,8). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the pneumatic 
springs (16) are connected to a pressure adjusting unit (50) for setting the pressure 

in the interior of the pneumatic springs (16). 
Use of the apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that the printed products (33) presented in an overlapping array (S) with their 

folded edge (33a), which extends at right angles to the conveying direction (F), 
leading in the said conveying direction, are fed to the pressing roll pairs (1, 2) with 

their folded edges (33a) turned towards the first, fixedly mounted pressing rolls (3, 
5).
