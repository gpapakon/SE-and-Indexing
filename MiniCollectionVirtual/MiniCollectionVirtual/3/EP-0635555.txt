<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a refinery for 
hydrotreating of petroleum fractions, and more particularly, 

a refining method and a refinery configuration comprising a 
step for distillation of a crude oil to separate a residue 

and a distillate and a step for hydrotreating the distillate 
at once in a single hydrotreating unit. If compared to the 

conventional wherein crude oil is distilled into several 
fractions and hydrotreating is carried out on each fraction 

independently, the present invention can simplify a refinery 
configuration and achieves compact plant with low capital 

investment cost, even for a small scale refinery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refining method and 
a refinery configuration for separating fractions of gas 
oil, kerosene, heavy naphtha, light naphtha, LPG, and light 
gas from crude oil, and for hydrotreating thereof. Fig. 8 illustrates a conventional refining procedure. 
Crude oil is supplied to an atmospheric distillation unit 1 
pre-treatment such as dehydration and desalting. In the 
atmospheric distillation unit 1, crude oil is distilled 
into fractions of light gas, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), 
light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene, gas oil, and 
residue. The light gas (off gas) from the atmospheric 
distillation unit is amine treated in an amine treating unit 
2 together with off gases from other process units to remove 
an acid gas contained in the off gas. Treated gas is used 
as s refining fuel gas. The acid gas is sent to a sulfur 
recovery unit 3 for recovery of sulfur. The LPG fraction is 
processed in an LPG treating unit 4 for eliminating 
impurities and is made into an LPG product. The light 
naphtha fraction is sweetened in a light naphtha treating 
unit 5 and blended into a high octane reformate. The heavy 
naphtha fraction is sent to a heavy naphtha hydrotreating 
unit 6 so as to be hydrotreated in the presence of a  
 
catalyst and then sent to a catalytic reforming unit 7 so as 
to be subjected to isomerization and aromatization and made 
into high octane reformate for high octane reformate 
blending. The kerosene fraction is sent to a kerosene 
treating unit 8 to remove mercaptan sulfur contained in 
kerosene. The gas oil fraction is sent to a gas oil 
hydrotreating unit 9 to be hydrotreated in the presence of a 
catalyst and, after removing impurities, made into a gas oil 
product. Cracked naphtha (wild naphtha) produced in this 
process is sent back to the atmospheric distillation unit 1. 
Residue from the atmospheric distillation unit 1 is used as 
a blending component of a heavy fuel oil or is further 
processed in a vacuum distillation unit to obtain a vacuum 
gas oil. According to the prior art, regardless of refinery 
capacity, crude oil is separated into several fractions in 
distillation unit and then each fraction is hydrotreated or 
treated independently. Therefore, a conventional refinery provides a rather 
complicated configuration and requires large capital 
investment cost. Especially for a small scale refinery, development of a 
compact plant with low capital investment cost has been 
desired. The present invention has been developed against the 
above
