<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic goods, and 
more particularly to door handles therefor. The present invention seeks to provide a door 
handle for electric units that has a soft feeling on 
use. To this end, the invention provides a door handle 
for electrical units comprising a reinforcing metal 
bracket within a body of soft material, the handle 
having upper and lower portions, and means for fixing 
such portions to the door of an electrical unit. 
Normally, the soft material comprises one of rubber and 
urethan. The metal bracket may extend through the body 
of soft material, the ends thereof forming the upper and 
lower portions of the handle. The invention will now be described by way of 
example and with reference to the accompanying schematic 
drawings wherein: 
Figure 1(A) is an exploded perspective view showing 
a door handle for an electrical unit in accordance with 
a known construction; Figures 1(B) and 1(C) are detail views of the 
handle shown in Figure 1(A); and Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of a 
handle embodying the present invention. As shown in Figure 1, the door 1 of an electrical 
unit such as a refrigerator has a handle 2 attached 
thereto. To mount the handle on the door 1, the engineer 
inserts the projection 2a which is formed on handle base 
2, into a rectangular groove la formed in the door 1 and 
pushes upward for securement by joining screws 3. The 
joining shape of the rectangular groove 1a and the 
groove 2a is shown in Figure 1(C). After securement of the handle base 2 into the door 
1, a decoration piece 4 is set onto the handle 2 and 
pushed in the direction C, to complete an assembly of  
 
two parts. Grooves 4a formed at the sides of decoration 
handle 4 and projections 2a of the handle base 2 cooperate 
to secure the decoration piece 4, as is shown in 
Figure 1(B). The decoration piece 4 is made of hard 
plastic. In the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 
2, a soft handle 102 is formed by moulding the shape of 
handle in rubber and coating urethan onto the surface 
thereof after completion of said moulding step. The 
handle 102 may be formed only by moulding of urethan. The assembly of a handle according to the present 
invention will now be described. First, the holder 104 is fixed to the door 100 by 
screws SC1, and the soft handle 102 pushed upward onto 
the handle holder 104. The soft handle 102 is then 
secured by screws SC2. The screws SC2 joining the handle holder 104 and 
the soft handle 102 are received in upper side holes 
101a of a
