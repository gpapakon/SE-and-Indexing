<ABSTRACT>
Collisions between messages simultaneously transmitted by multiple spread spectrum transmitters are reduced by distributing the transmissions over the available resources of the receiver. Each mobile station uses one or more randomization methods to distribute its transmissions. Each mobile station includes a microprocessor (100); an encoder (140); a timing generator (136); a PN long code sequence generator (146); and XOR gate (152). The system is used in a CDMA mobile telephone system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cellular telephone systems. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a system for increasing the
reliability of the cellular telephone system in environments having
substantial multipath propagation or under conditions wherein a large
number of mobile telephone units simultaneously attempt to access a base
station.Many communications systems have multiple transmitters that need
to randomly access one or more receivers. A local area network (LAN) is
one example of such a multiple access system. A cellular telephone system
is another. In any such system, when several transmitters attempt to
transmit simultaneously, the messages may interfere or "collide" with one
another. A receiver cannot distinguish among the messages involved in
the collision.Two such multiple access protocols, commonly called the "Aloha"
and "Slotted Aloha" protocols, are described in Bertsekas et al., Data
Networks, chapter 4, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1987. In the Aloha
protocol, each transmitter may transmit a message at any time. Upon
discovering that the transmitted message has collided, the transmitter waits
a random delay time and retransmits the message. In Slotted Aloha, all
messages fit into a time slot of a predetermined length. Upon discovering
that the transmitted message has collided, the transmitter delays a random
number of slots and then retransmits the message. In both methods, a
random delay is introduced to prevent transmitters from retransmitting
simultaneously.The use of code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation is one
of several techniques for facilitating communications in which a large
number of system users are present. The use of CDMA techniques in a
cellular telephone system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,265,119 entitled
"Method and Apparatus for Controlling Transmission Power in a CDMA
Cellular Mobile Telephone System" and in U.S. Patent No. 5,103,459 entitled
"System and Method for Generating Signal Waveforms in a CDMA Cellular
Telephone System," both assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In the above-mentioned patent, a multiple access technique is
disclosed where a large number of mobile stations, each having a
transceiver, communicate through base stations, also known as cell-sites,
using CDMA spread spectrum communication signals. The base stations
are connected to a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO), which in turn
is connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).The use of CDMA spread-spectrum techniques
