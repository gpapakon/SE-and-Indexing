<ABSTRACT>
An optical data storage system uses an optical medium 12 made of a 
stack of spaced-apart optical disks 50, 60, 70, 80. Each disk in the 

stack is made of light-transmissive material, such as polycarbonate when 
the system is a CD-ROM system, and has a partially light-transmissive 

data layer on at least one of its faces. A focusing lens 210 in the 
system focuses light to the data layers along optical paths, with each 

data layer corresponding to a unique optical path length. The light is 
focused to each data layer by reflection off adjacent data layers such 

that the total substrate thickness through which the light passes is the 
same for each optical path. In this manner, the fixed spherical 

aberration correction provided by the focusing lens is adequate and 
variable aberration correction is not necessary. By appropriate 

selection of reflectivities of the multiple data layers in the disk 
stack, it is possible to design the system so that the effective 

reflected light intensity from each data layer is the same, and that 
adjustable signal amplification is not necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical data storage media and
systems, and more specifically to optical media with multiple disk
surfaces and storage systems using such media.Optical data storage systems provide a means for storing great
quantities of data on a disk. The data is accessed by focusing a laser
beam onto the data layer of the disk and then detecting the reflected
light beam. Various kinds of systems are known. In a ROM (Read Only
Memory) system, such as a compact disk system (CD-ROM), data is
permanently embedded as marks in the disk at the time of manufacture of
the disk. The data is detected as a change in reflectivity as the laser
beam passes over the data marks. A WORM (Write-Once Read-Many) system
allows the user to write data by making marks, such as pits, on a blank
optical disk surface. Once the data is recorded onto the disk it cannot
be erased. The data in a WORM system is also detected as a change in
reflectivity. There are also erasable optical data storage systems, such
as phase change and magneto-optic (M-O) systems. While phase change
systems also read data by sensing a change in reflectivity, M-O systems
read data by measuring the rotation of the incident polarization caused
by the M-O media.To increase the storage capacity of an optical disk, multiple data
layer systems have been proposed. An optical disk having two or more
data layers may be accessed at different layers by changing the focal
position of the lens. One example of this type of system is described in
U.S. Patent 5,202,875 assigned to IBM. In such systems, the light from
the laser source must pass through one or more of the light-transmissive
disk substrates in order to access the data layers on the different
substrates. The focusing of the light through a relatively thick
substrate introduces spherical aberration into the light beam. In the
case of conventional single-disk optical systems, this can be corrected
by slightly changing the curvature of the focusing lens by a fixed amount
because the amount of substrate material through which the light must
pass remains fixed. However, in multiple data layer optical disk
systems, because the light is required to be focused through different
numbers and thicknesses of substrates, depending on which data layer is
being accessed, some form of adjustable active compensation for spherical
aberration is required.EP-A-0 517 491 discloses a solution for this problem
by using an abbavation compensator from the same material as the substrates and
providing a step-wise
