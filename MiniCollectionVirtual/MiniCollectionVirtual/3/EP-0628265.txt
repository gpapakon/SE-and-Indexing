<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to backpacks generally. Backpacks have been known for many years as a 
convenient means of carrying loads on the back of a person while 
leaving his hands free. Backpacks are most typically used by 
military personnel in the field and by mountaineers and hikers. A modern backpack is typically equipped with adjustable 
shoulder supports and a waist belt, both attached to the main 
pouch, or to a frame associated therewith, so as to most 
efficiently and comfortably locate the backpack on the back of a 
user. It has been recognized, however, as being desirable to 
enable adjustment of the position of the shoulder supports 
relative to the waist belt so as to fit the backpack with maximum 
comfort onto the back of a person. One type of backpack on the market employs adjustable 
length straps for attaching the shoulder supports to the main 
pouch frame. A further type of backpack on the market employs a 
generally vertical track to which the shoulder supports are 
attached, the position of the shoulder supports being determined 
by tightening of a screw so as to fix them in a selected 
position. A disadvantage of the systems employed by these two 
backpacks is that the distance between the shoulder supports and 
the waist belt cannot be adjusted while the backpack is located 
on a person's back.  A further backpack on the market employs a shoulder 
support adjustment system wherein the shoulder supports are 
attached via adjustable straps to a track mounted on an adjacent 
portion of the pouch. While this system permits a reduction in 
the distance between the shoulder supports and the waist belt 
while the backpack is being worn, the back pack must be removed 
from the back of the wearer in order to increase the shoulder 
support-waist belt distance. A further disadvantage of this 
backpack is that it is properly supported on the back only when 
the weight of the load being carried in the backpack is 
predominantly exerted in the direction of the hips, or down the 
back. If the wearer of the backpack bends over forwards, however, 
the backpack tends to slip off the back.  The present invention seeks to provide a system for 
enabling adjustment of the distance between the shoulder supports 
and the waist belt of a backpack while the backpack is being 
worn, wherein the system also provides support to a load being 
carried in the backpack, regardless of the orientation thereof. There is provided, therefore, in accordance with an 
embodiment of the invention, a backpack having an

   first elongate, flexible fastening means attached to 
said article carrying means and extending through said buckle 

means in association with said first buckle portion; and
 

   second elongate, flexible fastening means attached to 
said article carrying means and extending through said buckle 

means in association with said second buckle portion, 
   and wherein said body portion and said first and second 

buckle portions are configured to cooperate so as to selectably 
lock together said buckle means and at least one of said first 

and second flexible fastening means, thereby locking together 
said shoulder support means and said article carrying means. 
A backpack according to claim 2, and wherein said body 
portion is attached to said shoulder support means and defines 

first and second openings through which said first and second 
flexible fastening means respectively extend, 

   and wherein said first buckle portion is arranged in 
association with said first opening such that said first flexible 

fastening means extends through said first opening tangentially 
to said first buckle portion and thereabout so as to form a loop 

between said first buckle portion and said body portion, and back 
out through said first opening, and 

   said second buckle portion is arranged in association 
with said second opening such that said second flexible 

fastening means extends through said second opening tangentially 
to said first buckle portion and thereabout so as to form a loop 

between said second buckle portion and said body portion, and 
back out through said second opening. 
A backpack according to claim 3, and also comprising 
 

means enabling a predetermined displacement of said first buckle 
portion relative to said body portion in response to at least a 

predetermined force applied via said first flexible fastening 
means, said predetermined displacement causing entrapment of said 

first loop between said first buckle portion and said body 
portion, thereby locking said first flexible fastening means to 

said buckle means, and thereby also locking together said 
shoulder support means and said article carrying means.

enabling a predetermined displacement of said first buckle 

portion also includes means enabling a predetermined displacement 
of said second buckle portion relative to said body portion in 

response to at least a predetermined force applied via said 
second flexible fastening means, said predetermined displacement 

causing entrapment of said second loop between said second buckle 
portion and said body portion, thereby locking said second
