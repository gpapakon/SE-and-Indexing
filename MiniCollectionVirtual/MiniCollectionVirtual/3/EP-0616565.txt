<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to portable power tool means intended to form part of a power tool or a conversion unit adpated to be fitted to the shaft of a power tool. The tool means includes a rotary cam member (6, 8) having an internal sinusoidal cam track (12) in which cam followers (26) of an output shaft (2) are received. When the cam member (6, 8) rotates, the shaft (2) is caused to partake of a lengthwise reciprocating movement suitable for application to a scraper bit or other tool kit such as a chisel. In an example of the invention, the shaft (86) passes through a fixed bearing ring (88), a slidable sleeve (96) being provided to control engagement of the shaft (86) via a key member (104) with portions of the ring (88) or the cam member (76), so as to enable the shaft (86) to partake of lengthwise movement or to be convertible to rotational movement, as selected by the operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with power tools
particularly, but not exclusively, with power tools which
are relatively lightweight and suitable for use by the
general public.In GB-A-2219958 there is described
a portable power tool which comprises a housing and a
drive means for operating a range of interchangeable tool
bits such as scrapers and chisels or even tool bits which
perform the function of a small spade in breaking up
soil. All these power tools provide the user with the
advantages of a linear path for the powered stroke of the
bit, without component of rotary motion. This is
achieved by providing a cylinder cam mounted for rotation
with an output shaft and provided with a circumferential
sinusoidal cam track in which run cam followers
associated with the drive shaft, which is captive against
rotation. Tools made in accordance with the invention
described in that specification are remarkably efficient
in use as small hand-held tools, but if the intended
purpose of the tool requires a greater cam throw range
and/or a larger cam cylinder for smoothing action, the
shaft portion carrying the cam followers is also enlarged
making the components too cumbersome for ease of use and
incorporation into a reasonably sized housing.A further example of a small hand-held tool is
illustrated in FR-A-775120 of 1934 which
describes a smoothing device for improving the sliding 
surfaces of machine tools. The hand-held tool comprises
a hollow cylinder within which are disposed cylindrical
sleeves having undulating edge surfaces. A first,
hollow, spindle extends from the cylinder end wall. A
second spindle is freely received within the first
spindle so as to project into and through the hollow
cylinder. The second spindle which is held against
rotation is provided with a thickened eccentric portion
from which projects a single pin held captive between the
cylindrical sleeves. Rotation of the hollow cylinder
causes a smoothing blade secured to the outer end of the
second spindle to partake of a reciprocating action
designed to remove irregularities from a machined
surface.The present invention seeks to provide an
arrangement which will increase the versatility and
capability of a portable tool such as referred to above
while tending to avoid the penalty of increased size of
component parts.The invention provides a portable power tool means
comprising a housing, a drive means and a mounting
arrangement for a selected tool bit, said drive means
being adapted to drive an output shaft means in a
reciprocatory axial
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A portable power tool means comprising a housing
(30), a drive means and a mounting arrangement (32) for a

selected tool bit (34), said drive means (18) being
adapted to drive an output shaft means (2) in a

reciprocatory axial motion with respect to a longitudinal
axis thereof to drive said tool bit (34), including means

(24,28) provided to restrain said output shaft means (2)
against rotation when said output shaft means is

partaking of said reciprocatory axial motion, wherein
there is provided a rotatable cam device (6,8) to convert

rotary motion from the drive means into said
reciprocatory motion, said cam device (6,8) comprising a

sinusoidal cam track (12), characterised in that said cam
device (6,8) further comprises two block portions (6,8)

each having a radially corrugated cam surface (12' ,12''),
said block portions (6,8) being secured together so that

said cam surfaces confront each other at a uniform spaced
distance apart so as to provide a cavity in the form of a

radially corrugated disc, said surfaces (12' ,12'')
providing a sinusoidal cam track having a plurality of

lobes, said cavity having at least one passage (4) in
communication with the exterior of the block and

extending along a longitudinal central axis thereof, said
passage (4) being adapted to enclose said output shaft

means (2) along a portion thereof, said shaft being
provided with a plurality of cam follower means (26)

arranged equidistantly therearound so as to extend 
radially from the shaft means (2) and to be received

within the disc-shaped cavity of the block (6,8).
A power tool means as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said cam follower means comprises pins or rolling members

(26) projecting from said shaft (2) into said cavity.
A power tool means as claimed in either of claims 1
and 2, wherein the output shaft means comprises a shaft

(2) received in a sliding bearing arrangement (24) in
which rotational movement is prevented.
A power tool means as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the bore of the cam member is a

through-bore through which the output shaft (2) passes,
said cam member (6,8) being rotated through an eccentric

gearing arrangement (18) from an electric motor.
A power tool means as claimed in any of claims 1 to
3, wherein the bore (4) of the cam member (6,8) is a
