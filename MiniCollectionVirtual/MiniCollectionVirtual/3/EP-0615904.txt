<ABSTRACT>
Rotor craft rotor head including a hub (1), to which each blade is connected by means of an attachment piece (2) and of a spherical laminated stop (13). A rotary, viscoelastic-type drag damping device (303) is arranged between the attachment piece (2) and the hub (1), in such a way that the damping device (303) is articulated to the hub (1) around a spindle (61) allowing it to pivot due to the flapping of the blade. The damping device (303) includes a linking piece (346) linked to the hub (1) or to the attachment part (2) by a ball joint (56) in which the said linking piece (346) is able to move in translation. The rotary viscoelastic damper (303) consists of an alternate stacking of at least two metal discs, and of at least one layer fixed to the discs by vulcanising or bonding of a viscoelastic material with high stiffness and high remanence for deformations, each of the discs being linked to the hub (1) or to the attachment piece (2).
