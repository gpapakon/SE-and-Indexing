<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR THE TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS USING BISPHOSPHONATES AND PARATHYROID HORMONEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to methods of increasing bone mass in humans and other animals, i.e., for the treatment of osteoporosis and related bone metabolic disorders. In particular, this invention relates to such methods of treatment by the admin¬ istration of a bone-active phosphonate and parathyroid hormone.The most common metabolic bone disorder is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal tissue. In general, there are two types of osteoporosis: primary and secondary. "Secondary osteoporosis" is the result of an identifiable disease process or agent. However, approximately 90% of all osteoporosis cases is "primary osteoporosis". Such primary osteoporosis includes postmenopausal osteoporosis, age-associated osteoporosis (affecting a majority of individuals over the age of 70 to 80), and idiopathic osteoporosis affecting middle-aged and younger men and women.For some osteoporotic individuals the loss of bone tissue is sufficiently great so as to cause mechanical failure of the bone structure. Bone fractures often occur, for example, in the hip and spine of women suffering from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Kyphosis (abnormally increased curvature of the thoracic spine) may also result.The mechanism of bone loss in osteoporotics is believed to involve an imbalance in the process of "bone remodeling". Bone remodeling occurs throughout life, renewing the skeleton andSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 maintaining the strength of bone. This remodeling involves the erosion and filling of discrete sites on the surface of bones, by an organized group of cells called "basic multicellular units" or "BMUs". BMUs primarily consist of "osteoclasts", "osteoblasts", and their cellular precursors. In the remodeling cycle, bone is resorbed at the site of an "activated" BMU by an osteoclast, forming a resorption cavity. This cavity is then filled with bone by osteoblasts.Normally, in adults, the remodeling cycle results in a small deficit in bone, due to incomplete filling of the bone resorption cavity. Thus, even in healthy adults, age-related bone loss occurs. However, in osteoporotics, there is an increase in the number of BMUs that are activated. This increased activation accelerates bone remodeling, resulting in abnormally high bone loss.Although its etiology is not fully understood, there are many risk factors thought to be associated with
