<ABSTRACT>
A high pressure condenser (20) comprising a plurality of transversely 
spaced flattened tubes (21) having their ends extending into headers (23) 

at each end to the tubes and a plurality of undulating fins (22) 
extending between adjacent tubes. The tubes are made by utilizing flat 

strip stock that is coated on both surfaces with a coating that will 
fuse and bond on the application of heat and has a plurality of 

longitudinally and transversely spaced deformed portions or projections 
(25). The flat strip stock is subjected to the steps of first rolling 

the opposite edges of the strip into a curved configuration having a 
radius corresponding to the radius of curvature desired on the rounded 

longitudinally welded edge of the tube, then progressively rolling the 
central portion of the strip into the rounded configuration desired 

along the other longitudinal edge of the tube (21) while utilizing the 
rounded free edge portions and the center bend to accurately center the 

strip as it advances through the successive forming rolls and, 
thereafter heating the spaced free edges of the rolled strip to a 

temperature at which they are adapted to be fused together and directing 
them through a guide located upstream 

from and directly adjacent a pair of 
squeeze rolls for effecting a weld seam therebetween, the guide being 

designed to engage each free edge portion of the strip on laterally 
opposite sides thereof. The projections (25) in the strip are brought 

into engagement before the free edges of the rolled strip are fused 
together. When the tubes (21) are assembled with the fins to the headers 

(23), the entire assembly is subjected to heat to cause the coating on 
the surfaces of the tubes to bond the 
projections to one another and to 
bond the exterior of the tubes to the slots in the headers (23) through 

which the ends of the tubes extend.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method of making a
high pressure heat
condenser.In the manufacture of heat exchangers and particularly
high pressure heat exchangers, known as condensers, one of the
problems is the high pressure of the material handled such as
refrigerant requires either that the tubes utilized in the
condenser be thick or be extruded
with sufficient thickness
to provide multiple paths
that have the adequate strength.The tubes must be reinforced or the walls thereof
thickened.Thus, in one commercial form which has been utilized,
it is common to provide a plurality of flat extruded tubes that
have longitudinally extending channels for the refrigerant,
headers at each end or the tubes which are bonded to the tubes and
a plurality of sheets having openings through which the tubes
extend to provide fins.Another prior art method, according to the pre-characterising part of
claim 1, is known from US-A-5172476.The objective of the present invention is to
provide an
alternative method of making the condenser.This objective is realised by the method according to claim 1.In accordance with
one preferred embodiment of
the invention, a high pressure
condenser comprises a plurality of transversely spaced
flattened tubes having their ends extending into headers at
each end to the tubes and a plurality or undulating fins extending 
between adjacent tubes. The tubes are made by utilizing flat
strip stock that is coated on both surfaces with a coating that
will fuse and bond on the application of heat and has a plurality
of longitudinally and transversely spaced deformed portions or
projections. The flat strip stock is subjected to the steps
of first rolling the opposite edges of the strip into a curved
configuration having a radius corresponding to the radius of
curvature desired preferably on the rounded longitudinally welded edge of
the tube, then progressively rolling the central portion of the
strip into the rounded configuration desired along the other
longitudinal edge of the tube while utilizing the rounded free
edge portions and the center bend to accurately center the strip
as it advances through the successive forming rolls and,
thereafter heating the spaced free edges of the rolled strip to
a temperature at which they are adapted to be fused together
and directing them through a guide located upstream from and
directly adjacent a pair of squeeze rolls for effecting a weld
seam therebetween, the guide being designed to engage each free
edge portion of the strip on laterally opposite sides

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a high pressure condenser (20)
comprising a plurality of flattened tubes (21) having two

longitudinally extending rounded edges, the ends of which extend
into slots in a header

(23) whereby the flattened tubes (21) are made by roll-forming
flat strip stock, which has a coating on both surfaces,

the method characterised by

forming spaced indentations (25; 25a; 25b; 25c; 25d) in said strip,
which result in projections on the opposite side thereof,
subjecting the strip to the steps of

first rolling the opposite edges of the strip into a
curved configuration having a radius corresponding to the radius

of curvature desired on one rounded edge of a tube,
then progressively rolling the central portion of the
strip into the rounded configuration, desired along the other

longitudinal edge of the tube while utilizing the rounded edge
portions and the center portion to accurately center the strip

as it is advanced through the successive forming rolls,
thereafter heating the spaced free edges of the rolled
strip to a temperature at which the edges will fuse together and

directing them through a guide located upstream from and directly
adjacent a pair of squeeze rolls for effecting one or more weld seams

therebetween, the guide being designed to engage each free edge
portion of the strip on laterally opposite edges thereof,
bringing opposed projections in the strip into abutting engagement,
and assembling the tubes (21) with the fins (22) to the
headers (23)

with the ends of the tubes (21) extending into slots into the headers (23), 
subjecting the entire assembly to heat to cause the
coating on the surfaces of the tubes to bond the projections to

one another, to bond the exterior of the tubes to the slots in
the headers (23) through which the tubes (21) extend, and to bond the fins (22)

in the tubes (21).
The method set forth in claim 1 wherein said step of
forming indentations comprises forming longitudinally extending

transversely spaced indentations (25a).
The method set forth in claim 1 wherein said step of
forming indentations comprises forming longitudinally and

transversely spaced indentations (25b; 25c; 25d).
The method set forth in claim 3 wherein said
indentations (25b; 25d) are in longitudinally aligned rows.
The method set forth in claim 1 wherein said step of
forming said indentations (25c) comprises forming said indentations (25c)

in one row such that they are staggered longitudinally with
respect to indentations (25c) in an adjacent row.
