includes a photoconductive drum (1), a developing device 

(4) having a toner storage section, a replaceable toner 
cartridge (14) for supplying toner to the toner storage 

section, a cleaner (2) for clearing the photoconductive

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing
device and an image forming apparatus, such as an
electrophotographic apparatus or electrostatic printer,
which is provided with a developing device for visualizing
an electrostatic latent image and a toner cartridge
for replenishing the developing device with toner.Recently, there have been provided many image forming
apparatuses which incorporate a removable process
unit. In general, process units integrally comprise an
image carrier, a developing device, a cleaner for clearing
the image carrier of the toner remaining thereon
after transfer, and a waste toner receiving section for
receiving the toner removed by means of the cleaner.
Among these process units, those which use a removable
toner cartridge for replenishing the developing device
with the toner have an advantage over those which are
furnished with an integral toner cartridge in entailing
lower initial cost.Generally, moreover, life management of the process
unit is based on its lifetime print quantity or frequency
of toner-empty detection. If the lifetime print
quantities for the process unit and each toner cartridge
are 10K and 5K, respectively, the life is determined
depending on the detection of the attainment of 10K by
the print quantity or a second detection of a toner-empty
state, whichever is earlier. Usually, in this case, the lifetime print quantity
is a value for standard printing (with print ratio of
5%, for example), so that it is inevitably subject to
variation depending on the user of the apparatus. The
frequency of toner-empty detection is a question here.
If the user replaces the toner cartridge before the
toner-empty state is established, for example, then the
toner-empty state cannot be detected, so that the life
of the process unit will be determined solely by the
print quantity.No problem will arise, in this situation, if
the user employs an average print ratio lower than the
standard print ratio. If the user's average print ratio
is higher than the standard ratio, however, the printing
entails a large toner consumption, unlimited in an
extreme case.Thus, in the process unit which contains therein
the receiving section for receiving the waste toner
removed by the cleaner for clearing the image carrier of
the toner remaining thereon after transfer, the capacity
of the waste toner receiving section must be made so
large that the process unit itself is very bulky.To cope with this, a method for detecting the frequency
of toner cartridge mounting is conventionally
proposed.
