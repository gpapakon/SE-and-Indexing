<ABSTRACT>
An ECG diagnostic pad having upper fit portions (12,120) 
with upper limb lead electrodes (22a,22b,240), central fit 

portions (14,140) with unipolar precordial lead electrodes 
(32a-32f) and lower fit portions (16,160) with flank lead 

electrodes (42a,42b,440) is fitted onto the chest wall of 
a human subject. Only by attaching the pad onto the chest 

wall of the subject, the lead electrodes (22a,22b,32a-32f, 
42a,42b,240,440) can readily be brought in close contact 

with the desired locations prescribed anatomically on the 
chest wall with accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
diagnostic pad capable of measuring and recording 
electrocardiograms of the electric current detected from 
various parts of the body for electrocardiographic 
diagnostic purposes, and more particularly, to an ECG 
diagnostic pad having ECG electrodes which can readily be 
brought in contact with the anatomically prescribed parts 
of the body of a human subject with accuracy merely by 
attaching the pad onto the chest wall of the body. Analytical diagnostics which are made by utilization 
of electrocardiograms (ECG) have been generally applied 
for a diagnosis of cardiopathy, for example. As one of 
existing electrocardiographs, there has been widely used 
so far the so-called Holter's electrocardiograph of a 
portable type with a built-in cassette tape recorder for 
continuously detecting and recording ECG data over a long 
period of time. A standard 12-lead ECG method for inducing twelve sorts of 
lead ECG currents from the body of a human subject by 
using the aforesaid portable electrocardiograph and so on 
has been known. In this 12-lead ECG method, bipolar limb 
lead ECG (Standard lead I: left arm-right arm; Standard 
lead II: left leg-right arm; and Standard lead III: left 
leg-left arm), unipolar limb lead ECG (Standard lead aVR: 
right arm, and left arm-left leg; Standard lead aVL: left 
arm, and right arm-left leg; and Standard lead aVF: left 
leg, and right arm-left arm), and unipolar precordial lead 
EGG (V1-V6) are analyzed. Namely, twelve electric 
potential differences which are expressed in terms of the 
waveforms (ECG pattern) which vary with time are detected 
by applying ECG lead electrodes to ten parts of the 
subject's body and provide information on the condition 
and performance of the heart.  The ECG lead electrodes for detecting bipolar and unipolar 
limb leads are attached onto both arms and both legs, and 
the ECG lead electrodes for unipolar precordial lead are 
attached onto the chest wall. Particularly, the unipolar 
precordial lead electrodes are placed at six anatomically 
prescribed locations on the left-hand region of the chest 
wall close by the heart. In most cases, a human subject 
or patient would enlist the aid of a doctor or other 
helpers to attach the ECG lead electrodes onto the surface 
of the subject's body and endure discomfort. Besides, the 
work of attaching the ECG lead electrodes requires much 
time and labor and proves to be troublesome. To eliminate the aforenoted drawbacks suffered by the 
conventi
