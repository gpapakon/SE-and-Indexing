<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
motor which comprises:
a stator having a piezoelectric member which is
vibrated by a drive signal, and an elastic member for
generating a vibration in a drive surface thereof upon
vibration of said piezoelectric member; anda rotor which is driven by the generated
vibration, and has a slider member urged against the
drive surface of said elastic member and a rotor base
coupled to said slider member.The structure of a conventional ultrasonic motor
is disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-62-77068. Fig. 6 is a
sectional view of the ultrasonic motor. A stator 1 is
constituted by integrally fixing a piezoelectric
member 1b to an elastic member 1a. A radial support
member 3 is integrally molded on an inner peripheral
surface of the elastic member 1a near a neutral axis
of the stator 1 as a whole. The support member 3 has
a thin plate portion 3a provided to the inner
peripheral surface of the elastic member 1a, and a
thick portion 3b provided on the peripheral edge of
the thin plate portion 3a and having a larger
thickness than that of the thin plate 
portion 3a. A technique for integrally molding the
support member to the elastic member in this manner is
also disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-59-213286.
The thick portion 3b is fixed in a case 5 which
receives a bearing 4.A flange portion 6a radially projects from the
inner periphery of the rotor 2, and a thick portion 6b
is integrally molded on the peripheral edge of the
flange portion 6a. A compression force by a given
means (not shown) is applied to the thick portion 6b
through a bearing 7, so that a lower surface 8 of the
rotor 2 is urged against a drive surface 1c of the
elastic member 1a.When an AC voltage is applied to the piezoelectric
member 1b, the piezoelectric member 1b causes bending
vibration, and a traveling vibration wave is generated
in the elastic member 1a. This vibration wave
frictionally drives the rotor 2. The generation
mechanism of the traveling vibration wave is described
in detail in JP-A-60-24582, and a description thereof
will be omitted.In the above structure, when the thick portion 3b
of the support member 3 is fixed by a pressing 40 and a
fixing cylinder 50 or their equivalents shown in
Fig. 2, the following problems are posed. If a lower
end face 3c of the thick portion 3b of the support
member 3 is not flat, when the thick portion 3b is 
fixed by the pressing 40 and the fixing cylinder 50
shown in Fig. 2, an internal stress is generated in the
elastic member 1a, thus decreasing drive efficiency of
the
