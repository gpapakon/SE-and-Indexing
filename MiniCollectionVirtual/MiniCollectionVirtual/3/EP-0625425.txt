<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a thermal printer which includes a 
dot number computing memory (152, 252) for detecting the 

number of dots which are simultaneously heated according 
to gradation by receiving image data in line units, a dot 

number computing controller (153, 253), a thermistor for 
detecting the temperature of a thermal print head (TPH), 

and a corrector (154, 156, 255) for controlling the TPH to 
emit heat by gradation with a substantially constant 

energy by varying the pulse width of a strobe signal 
depending on the detected number of simultaneous 

heated-by-gradation dots and temperature of the thermal 
print head (TPH), and a printing method thereof. Picture 

quality is improved by compensating a picture quality 
deterioration due to the TPH common drop and a temperature 

characteristic, by varying a heating period of the TPH.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal printer and 
printing method thereof, and more particularly (though not 
exclusively), to a thermal printer for compensating for a 
picture quality deterioration due to a common drop and a 
temperature characteristic of a thermal print head, and 
printing method thereof. In general, examples of an apparatus for printing using a 
thermal print head (TPH) are a thermal printer, a colour 
copier, a facsimile, etc. Among these, a sublimation-type 
thermal printer prints a desired image or picture 
according to the transfer amount of dye on a sheet of 
recording paper, by applying energy to the TPH and 
sublimating the dye of a dye-deposited film by the energy 
emitted from the TPH. A conventional thermal printer stores one frame of image 
data to be printed in its frame memory 10, as shown in 
FIG. 1. When printing starts, the frame memory 10 transfers one 
line of the image data to be printed to a line memory 20 
and a first selection contact point aO of a controlling 
switch 51, at the same time. The one line of image data to be printed is synchronized 
with the clock generated in a clock generator 31 and 
stored in the line memory 20 according to the address 
generated in an address counter 32. Gradation counter 33 
generates gradation data having a value of 0-255, given 
that the image data is expressed in eight-bit form, and 
outputs as an input signal of a comparator 34.  
 When data is read from line memory 20 and actually printed 
in TPH 40, the data is printed according to gradation. 
For example, if image data consists of eight bits, 
gradation levels represented as values from 0 to 255 can 
be indicated and TPH 40 prints 255 times, from gradation 
1 to gradation 255, with respect to each pixel. The gradation counter 33 increases the counter values from 
1 to 255. Then, the output of gradation counter 33 and 
the eight bit image data of line memory 20 are compared 
with respect to their gradations, in the comparator 34. 
As the result thereof, the output of comparator 34 becomes 
"high" or "low," thereby determining whether the dots of 
TPH 40 are to emit heat or not. Meanwhile, controlling switch 51, dot number computing 
memory 52, dot number computing controller 53, common drop 
correcting ROM 54, and strobe signal generator 55 
constitute a common drop correcting unit 50 for 
compensating picture quality deterioration due to a common 
drop of TPH 40. Analog-to-digital converter 61, temperature correcting ROM 
62, and power source 63 composed of a
