<ABSTRACT>
Method for managing pieces of information and data relating to telephone number
lists, stored in a telephone apparatus of the electronic type, the displaying and use

thereof being allowed only after the input, by one of the users of the said apparatus, of
a personal secret access code, previously defined, in order to guarantee the

maximum of privacy for each of the users.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to telephone apparatus and in particular to a method for
managing pieces of information and data relating to telephone number lists, stored in
a telephone apparatus of the electronic type, the displaying and use thereof being
allowed only after the input of an access code.It is known that in some telephone apparatus it is possible to automatically memorize
pieces of information and data relating to telephone numbers, corresponding to
telephone calls, which have been made or received with the said apparatus, and
which are maintained in suitable lists, prepared by the users or automatically by the
apparatus itself.In this way it is possible for the user to have a record of each one of the calls made or
received, together with the corresponding date, duration, number and name of the
calling or called persons, and in case also special notes, by voice or text according to
the capacity of the apparatus and the desire of the user.Normally the electronic telephone apparatus provide for a security accessing function,
which allows to inhibit the activation of outgoing calls or of some of the different
functions of the apparatus, so that any unauthorized use is prohibited; in this way
however the apparatus may be used only for receiving incoming calls, or eventually
for making emergency calls and the function of the apparatus is strongly limited.In fact normally a telephone apparatus, particularly of the mobile type, is designed by
the manufacturer assuming that it will be used by a single user, and therefore a single
access code is foreseen; in this way, once said access code has been inputted, all the
facilities of the apparatus are made possible, with the only exclusion of the
reprogramming of the function parameters, which normally require a second and more
complicated accessing code. However, if the telephone apparatus, for instance of the mobile type, is used by more
than one people, which can also be unknown persons, for instance employees of the
same company or legal entity, such a common access possibility may constitute a
violation of the privacy of the users which have legally stored into the telephone
memory pieces of information or personal data, may be confidential, or which have
received calls from persons which it is desired to keep unknown.Once activated the apparatus inputting the normal accessing code, any person could
not only verify the existence of said number lists, memorized by another person or
automatically, but also retrieve all the data and pieces of

<CLAIMS>
Method for managing pieces of information and data relating to telephone number
lists, stored in a telephone apparatus of the electronic type, characterized in that the

displaying and/or the use of a restricted part of said list of said numbers, for the
outgoing and/or the incoming calls, is allowed only after the input, by one of the users

of the said apparatus, of a personal secret access code, previously defined, in order to
protect said numbers contained in said restricted part of the list.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the stored lists are at least two,
one public and one private and that there are provided procedures for the

memorization in the public list of all the not code protected telephone numbers of the
outgoing 
and/or incoming calls, and for the memorization in the private list, which can
be accessed only after the input of the said secret code, of the code protected

telephone numbers of the outgoing and/or incoming calls.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the stored list is only one, and
that in case of a normal use of the telephone apparatus, only the not protected

numbers can be viewed, while, in order to display also the protected numbers, it is
necessary, before the list is recalled, to supply a secret code number.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that there are provided, for the
telephone apparatus, two operating modes, a first mode which is free, without access

restrictions, and a second public mode, with access restrictions.
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that, in said public mode it is provided
the possibility of rejecting an incoming call and the corresponding blocking of any

visual and/or sound signal, in the case that the call is coming from one of said
protected numbers.
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that the switching from said second
operating mode to said first operating mode can be effected at any moment through a

special keyboard command.
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that said special keyboard command
consists of a particular sequence of commands and/or in a plurality of contemporary

commands, having a predetermined duration.
Method according to claims 6 and 7, characterized in that, after the input of said
special keyboard command, the switching to the private mode is accomplished only

after the input of said personal secret code.
Method for managing pieces of information and data relating to telephone number
lists, stored in a telephone apparatus of the electronic type, according to the teachings

contained in the present description and in the attached drawings.
Telephone apparatus using the method for managing pieces of information and
data relating to telephone number lists, stored in a telephone apparatus of the

electronic type, according to one or more of the preceding claims.
