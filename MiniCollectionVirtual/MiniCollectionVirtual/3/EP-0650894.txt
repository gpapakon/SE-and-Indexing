<DESCRIPTION>
"Protective element for rapid packing of objects". This model refers to a protective element for the rapid packing of objects, 
especially applicable to the packing of small and medium-sized objects, consisting of 
a layer of foam in low-density thermoplastic material, inside a sleeve of thermoplastic 
barrier material. Said sleeve is open, but once the inside plate is in place, the foam is cut and 
the sleeve is hermetically sealed. When it is to be used, the sleeve or bag made of barrier material is punctured 
and the foam returns to its original volume, adapting both to the container in which 
it is placed and to the object it contains. Said plate may be of any geometric shape, depending on the recipient for 
which it is to be used for packing. It can even be placed in a plastic envelope to 
protect any product it may be wished to deliver. It can similarly be placed inside a box, to enclose a product requiring 
protection. Other applications include its use for comfort, as a cushion, at large events, 
to damp vibrations, noise, etc. The object of this model is that, being compressed, it takes up very little space 
and so is easy to store and transport. These specifications make clear the benefits of this model, but the following 
are some of the most notable, given by way of illustration only and without 
limitation: 
Ease of manufacture. Reduced weight. Ease of handling and adaptation to any object for protection or any 
container in which it is placed. Limited space requirement, facilitating and cheapening storage and 
transport. For a better understanding of these specifications, the attached drawings give 
an example of a design, without limitation, and show:  Figure 1. The single page of drawings shows a cross-section of the plate which 
is the subject of this model, open and prior to the compression of the foam. Figure 2 is a view of the subject of this model once compressed. In accordance with these drawings, this model consists of a plate of low-density 
thermoplastic type foam (1) inside a sleeve (2) made of a thermoplastic barrier 
material. Said plate is compressed by the foam (4) then closing the sleeve hermetically, 
so that the plate takes on a minimum thickness, making it extremely ductile and 
enabling it to adapt easily to any object. Subsequently, when this element is placed in any packing or wrapping, the 
sleeve is punctured and the foam returns to its initial volume, adapting to the 
container and to the object it is to protect. Finally, following this description, it remains
