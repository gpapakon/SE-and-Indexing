<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a rigid panel for a vehicle roof, with a peripheral seal opposite the roof opening. For the purpose of more simple manufacture and easier assembly, it is envisaged according to the invention that the gap seal (3) be manufactured in the form of a coextruded profile with a profile region (10), which surrounds the glass panel (2) and the edge (16) of the baseframe (15), is made of an elastomer and has an inner, U-shaped reinforcement (20), and an outer profile region in the form of a hollow-chamber seal (22) made of microcellular rubber, be supplied as a constructional unit prebent at the four corners (30 - 33) to form a frame (6) which is still open on the rear longitudinal side, and during assembly be placed laterally onto the edge of the other constructional unit comprising the glass panel (2) and base frame (15), and the open frame ends (7, 8) be bonded and screwed.

A method of manufacturing a rigid lid for an automobile roof 
comprising a seal on all sides of the roof opening, a glass 

panel (2) bonded to a baseframe (15) provided with a 
backing in the edge portion and protruding on the sides, as 

well as a weatherstrip (3) connected to the protruding edge 
of the baseframe (15), character
ized in that said 
weatherstrip (3) is produced in the form of a coextruded 

section including a section portion (10) of an elastomer 
incorporating on the inside a U-shaped strengthening (20) 

and an outer section portion in the form of a sponge rubber 
hollow cavity seal (22) surrounding said glass panel (2) 

and the edge of said baseframe (15) which is furnished 
prebent at the four corners (30 - 33) to form a frame (6) 

which is still open at the rear longitudinal side as a 
single unit and which on being fitted to the edge of the 

other unit comprising said glass panel (2) and said 
baseframe (15) is fitted to the sides, the open frame ends 

(7, 8) then being bonded and screwed in place. 
The method as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
prebending of said open frame (6) is done by means of a 

stretch or roll forming method. 
The method as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
the elastomer portion is produced from EPDM having a Shore 

A hardness of roughly 70. 
A lid produced by the method as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized in that said weatherstrip (3) consists of two 

section lengths (A, B) in the form of a length (A) 
extending over the front edge of the lid (2) including a 

sealing lip (25) extending over the side of the sponge 
rubber section portion (22) from the elastomer part and a 

sealing lip (24) extending inclined downwardy and outwardly 
from the sponge rubber section portion (22) as well as in  

 
the form of a length (B) extending over the remaining 

portion of the lid including a lip (26) extending 
downwardly from the elastomer portion (10) and a sealing 

lip (25) with a cutaway in the upper portion. 
The lid as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that said 
weatherstrip (3) is extruded continuously together with 

said section lengths A and B in one piece such that said 
sealing lip (25) of said section length (A) extending from 

said elastomer part (10) is peeled off in the side portions 
of section length (B) directly following extrusion. 
The lid as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that said 
elastomer portion of said section (10) comprises three webs 

(11, 12, 13) protruding from the side, of which the two 
upper webs (1, 12) clasp the edge (14) of said glass panel 

(2) and the two lower webs (12, 13) clasp the edge (16) of 
said baseframe (15) and an internal strengthening (20) 

extends U-shaped from said upper web (11) over the vertical 
main portion of the section (10) into said lower web (13) 

and covers the edge of said glass panel (2) and baseframe 
(15). 
The lid as set forth in claim 6, characterized in that said 
strengthening (20) consists of a stamped band including 

internal cutouts (21). 
The lid as set forth in claim 6, characterized in that 
between said upper and middle web (11, 12) a sealing lip 

(18) sealing off the surrounding edge (14) of said glass 
panel (2) is arranged. 
The lid as set forth in claim 6, characterized in that said 
middle web is configured as a sealing lip (55) for the edge 

(14) of said glass panel (2).  
 
The lid as set forth in claim 9, characterized in that said 
edge (16) of said baseframe (15) is defined by means of an 

activatable adhesive (53) between said two lower webs (62, 
55). 
The lid as set forth in claim 10, characterized in that said 
activatable adhesive (67) is embedded in a side recess (66) 

of said middle web (55). 
The lid as set forth in claim 6 and 9, characterized in that 
said strengthening in said upper portion is configured two-layer 

sectionwise such that said upper strengthening (57) 
extends from the section web (51) covering said glass panel 

(2) at the edge (14) with an approximate Z-shaped kink (58) 
up to said main portion of the section (50) and the lower, 

U-shaped strengthening (60) extends from below the kink 
(58) of said upper strengthening (57) up to the lower web 

(62).
