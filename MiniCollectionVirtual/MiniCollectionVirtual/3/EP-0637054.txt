<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a discharge plasma
processing device.Plasmas are easily produced by applying DC and/or AC electric
field, and are utilized for many kinds of processing such as
cleaning, coating, etching, sputtering and and plasma CVD on the
surface of objects to be processed such as substrates and other
targets. However, it is difficult to process the surface freely as
programmed, for instance sufficiently in uniform, without any other
treatment.Magnetic field is an effective means to localize in space the
plasma production. When an electron cyclotron resonance phenomenon
is used, plasma is produced at a position of specified magnetic field
where the resonance arises, which works as a point plasma source. A
planner magnetron discharge which is realized by a special
combination of electric field E and magnetic field B near a cathode
surface is also useful for sputtering process. However, the eroding
efficiency of cathode target used is rather low even when the
permanent magnet is set movably. In the document JP-A-5 013 404 an example for a semiconductor
processing device is given that uses an ECR-CVD device.
A semiconductor substrate is set on an electrostatic chuck in
the evacuated reaction chamber of an ECR-CVD device, and the
currents of solenoid coils are adjusted in order to produce a
surface of zero magnetic flux in the vicinity of a semiconductor
substrate. Thus, the deposition of a film on the semiconductor
can be controlled due to the magnetic field properties.The invention relates to a discharge plasma
processing device according to claim 1.The very new idea proposed here is characterized by the use
of plasma produced in a magnetic neutral line
which is made up with zero magnetic field points connected continuously.
The magnetic neutral line can be closed or opened.
The plasma is produced by applying an electric field
along the neutral magnetic line, for which an alternative AC
field can be applied in the case of closed loop, while a direct DC
field and/or AC field can be 
used for the opened line case.By choosing an adequate combination of current carrying
conductors or a system of permanent magnets for the magnetic field
composition, the magnetic neutral line is formed in an arbitrary
shape of any size at a variable distance from the object to be
processed. As these geometric parameters of the magnetic neutral
line can be controlled even during the processing period as well as
the plasma parameters can be controlled with rf power input, freely
programmed processing like as
