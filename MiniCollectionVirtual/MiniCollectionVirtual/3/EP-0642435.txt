A brake pressure control method in a vehicle brake system 
equipped with an electronically adjustable brake pressure 

booster (28), with which an actuating speed of the brake 
pedal (10) is determined and brake pressure boosting 

effected in response to the same, wherein, during a braking 
operation, a stored or calculated design or desired value 

(P
soll
) of the brake pressure that is exclusively responsive 
to the instantaneous actuating speed constantly is 

associated with a respective instantaneous actuating speed 
(v
Ped
) of the brake pedal (10), and wherein the brake 
pressure actual value (P
Br
) is measured at this instant 
and compared with the design value, and the brake pressure 

booster (28) is adjusted in response to the result of the 
comparison between the design and actual values.
