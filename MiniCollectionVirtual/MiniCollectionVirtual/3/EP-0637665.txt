<ABSTRACT>
Mechanism for blocking and releasing a motor vehicle door lock comprising an internal lever (13) articulated about a hinge pin (12) and a blocking lever (20) articulated about the same hinge pin (12), a tumbler (50) mounted pivoting about a pin (51) parallel to the said hinge pin (12) and intended to interact with a retaining pawl (3) of the latch (2) of the lock; the mechanism further includes a transfer lever (30) articulated about the hinge pin (12) and interacting with the tumbler (50) in order to actuate the said tumbler (50) and releaseable engagement means for rendering the interior lever (13) and the transfer lever (30) integral in terms of rotation, or not integral in terms of rotation.

Mechanism for locking and unlocking a motor-vehicle 
door lock, the said lock being able to assume a 

"locked" position in which outside operation is impossible, 
or an "unlocked" position in which the lock can be 

operated both from outside and from inside the vehicle, 
or a "super-locked" position in which the lock cannot be 

operated either from outside or from inside the vehicle, 
the said mechanism comprising an internal lever (13) 

pivoted about a pivot pin (12) and a locking lever (20) 
pivoted about the same pivot pin (12), a rocker (50) 

mounted so as to pivot about a pin (51) parallel to the 
said pivot pin (12) and intended to act cooperatively 

with a pawl (3) for catching on the latch bolt (2) of the 
lock, characterized by the fact that it furthermore 

includes a transfer lever (30) pivoted about the pivot 
pin (12) and acting cooperatively with the rocker (50) in 

order to actuate the said rocker (50) and disengageable 
clutch means for making the internal lever (13) and the 

transfer lever (30) rotationally integral, or not, the 
internal lever (13) and the transfer lever (30) being 

rotationally integral in the "unlocked" and "locked" 
positions of the lock and being rotationally free in the 

"super-locked" position of the lock. 
Mechanism according to Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the disengageable clutch means comprise a 

clutch member (40) in the form of a plate (41) provided 
with an oblong hole (42) by which the plate (41) is 

mounted on the pivot pin (12) so that the clutch member 
(40) can rotate about the pivot pin (12) and move 

transversely with respect to the said pivot pin (12), the 
said clutch member (40) bearing a clutch stud (43), the 

transfer lever (30) having an oblong opening (31) and the 
internal lever (13) having, at one of its ends (16), a 

longitudinal recess (17), the clutch stud (43) of the 
clutch member (40) passing through the oblong opening 

(31) in the transfer lever (30) and being designed to 
act cooperatively with the recess (17) of the internal  

 
lever (13) or not to act in this way depending on the 

transverse position of the clutch member (40) with 
respect to the pivot pin (12). 
Mechanism according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized by the fact that the locking lever (20) is 

provided with a control tab (22) designed to act cooperatively 
with a tab (33) on the transfer lever (30). 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that the transfer lever (30) 

bears a return (32) by means of which it acts cooperatively 
with the rocker (50). 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized by the fact that the clutch member (40) 

bears an actuation stud (44), the clutch stud (43) and 
the actuation stud (44) being arranged on either side of 

the plate (41). 
Mechanism according to Claim 2, characterized by 
the fact that the plate (41) is extended, on one of its 

sides, as a lug (45) making an acute angle with the axis 
of the oblong hole (42). 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized by the fact that the internal lever (13), 

the transfer lever (30), the clutch member (40) and the 
locking lever (20) are placed in succession around the 

pivot pin (12). 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized by the fact that the locking lever (20) and 

the clutch member (40) are electromechanically actuated 
from a control unit (70) comprising an electric 

motor (71) which is designed to move an actuation 
rod (74) in order to actuate the locking lever (20) and 

an electric motor (81) which is designed to move a clutch 
lever (84) acting cooperatively with the actuation 

stud (44) of the clutch member (40) in order to actuate 
the latter. 
Mechanism according to Claim 8, characterized by 
the fact that position detectors (76, 86) make it possible 

to display on the dashboard the position of the 
actuation rod (74) and of the clutch lever (84).  

 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized by the fact that it is mounted on a rear 

door and makes it possible to obtain a "child-locked" 
position of the lock, in which the internal lever (13) 

and the transfer lever (30) are free to rotate and the 

locking lever (20) occupies the position which it has 
when the lock is unlocked. 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized by the fact that it is mounted on a door 

not provided with a key-operated cylinder plug and 
includes, furthermore, an emergency lever (90) which is 

capable of actuating the locking lever (20). 
Mechanism according to Claim 11, characterized by 
the fact that the emergency lever (90) comprises two 

pivoted plane pieces (91, 93) arranged so that action in 
one direction on one piece (93) has no effect on the 

other piece (91). 
Mechanism according to one of Claims 2 to 9, 
characterized by the fact that it is mounted on a door 

whose lock is equipped with a key-operatable cylinder 
plug and the locking lever (20) bears a stop (26) capable 

of acting cooperatively with the lug (45) of the clutch 
member (40). 
Motor-vehicle door lock equipped with a lock 
locking and unlocking mechanism characterized by the fact 

that the said mechanism is of the type according to 
Claims 1 to 13.
