<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chair (1), especially an office swivel chair, having a seat support (6) which is held upon a chair lower part (7) and which is pivotably connected to a seat (2) which is motionally coupled via a synchronising sliding guide (5) or suchlike synchronising mechanism to a back rest (3), the seat (2) being supported by a restoring device (5) acting against the pivoting-down movement. Characteristic of the chair (1) according to the invention is that the seat support (6) is movably guided on the chair lower part (7) approximately in the vertical direction, that the seat (2) is supported on the chair lower part (7) by means of the restoring device (5) and that there is provided within the movement-transmission path between backrest (3) and chair lower part (7) a device (14) for blocking and/or compensating the movement transmitted to the restoring device (5) during a pivoting-back movement of the backrest (3). The chair according to the invention, in which the restoring force of the backrest (3) is automatically adapted in dependence on the weight of the person using the chair and rises with increasing backrest inclination, is distinguished by its constructionally simple and compact design.

<CLAIMS>
A chair, particularly an office chair, comprising a 
seat support (6) which is held on a lower chair part 

(7), is guided thereon so as to be movable in an 
approximately vertical direction and is joined in a 

swivelling fashion to a seat (2) movably coupled with 
a backrest (3) by means of a synchronizing sliding 

guide (5) or by a similar synchronizing mechanism, 
whereby the seat (2) is supported at the lower chair 

part (7) by a readjusting apparatus acting in 
opposition to the swinging movement, and whereby 

there is provided within the movement transmission 
path between backrest (3) and lower chair part (7) an 

apparatus (14) for blocking and/or compensating for 
the movement transmitted to the readjusting apparatus 

(8) during a backward swivelling movement of the 
backrest (3). 
A chair as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the blocking apparatus (14) is active in the 

transmission of movement between seat support (6) and 
lower chair part (7), and that the blocking apparatus 

(14) is activable during a backward swivelling 
movement of the backrest (3). 
A chair as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the blocking apparatus (14) is 

coupled with the synchronizing sliding guide (5). 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the blocking apparatus (14) is 

configured as a braking device, preferably engaged 
frictionally, that is rigidly joined to the seat  

 
support (6) and that, in its blocking position (14), 

engages with the lower chair part (7). 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the blocking apparatus (14) is 

a clamping collar or clamping shackle (15) that 
preferably encompasses an approximately vertically 

protruding section of the lower chair part (7) and, 
in its blocking position, lies at least in some 

regions in frictional engagement against said section 
of the lower chair part (7). 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that at least one of the two free 

collar arms (16, 17) of the collar clamp (15) is 
provided on the outside with a ramp bevel (18), 

particularly helical in shape, that cooperates with a 
corresponding matching bevel (19) which is preferably 

supported so as to be essentially immovable in the 
axial direction and is movably coupled with the 

backrest (3). 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that each of the two free collar 

arms (16, 17) of the clamping collar (15) has a 
helical ramp bevel (18), that each of the ramp bevels 

(18) has an associated matching bevel (19) supported 
essentially immovably in the axial direction, and 

that said bevel surfaces on opposite sides of the 
clamping collar have helical shapes oriented in 

opposite directions of rotation. 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 76, 
characterized in that the backrest (3) is joined with 

a backrest support (11) guided in an adjustable  
 

fashion in the synchronizing sliding guide (5), that 
the backrest support (11) is joined to at least one 

clamping lever (22) swivel-mounted in the common axis 
of rotation (21) of the matching bevels (19), and 

that associated to each clamping lever (22) is a 
matching bevel (19) non-rotatably connected thereto. 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the readjusting apparatus (5) 

has arranged in the swivel axis between seat (2) and 
seat support (6) a torsion bar (9) as restoring 

force, that said torsion bar (9) is on the one hand 
non-rotatably held at the seat (2) and on the other 

is non-rotatably connected to a support lever (10), 
said support lever (10) being supported in the region 

of its free end at the lower chair part (7). 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the lower chair part (7) is 

adjustable in height and for that purpose has two 
vertical guides with preferably two enclosing guide 

bushings (24, 25), of which a first guide bushing 
(24) is associated with a gas pressure spring (26) or 

similar height adjustment element, and a second guide 
bushing (25) is associated with the seat support (6). 
A chair as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that in its clamping position the 

clamping collar or clamping shackle (15) engages with 
the height adjustment element (26) at the upper 

section thereof projecting above the first guide 
bushing (24).
