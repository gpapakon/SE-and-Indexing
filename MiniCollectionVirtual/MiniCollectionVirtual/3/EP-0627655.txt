<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a projection exposure 
unit for projecting and exposing an image of a film 

onto a photosensitive material, an image exposure unit 
for exposing the photosensitive material based on 

exposure image information with setting an exposure 
amount for each of a number of areas of the 

photosensitive material, a transport device for 
transporting the photosensitive material through the 

projection exposure unit and the image exposure unit, 
a reader device for reading the image information of 

the film with dividing the image information into a 
number of areas, and a correction information 

inputting device for inputting a correction-target 
portion of the image information read by the reader 

device and a correction content for the correction-target 
portion. Based on the image information read 

by the reader device and on correction information 
instructed by the correction information inputting 

means, the image exposure unit generates, as the 
exposure image information, image information 

concerning only the correction-target portion 
corrected in accordance with the correction content. 

The transport device transports the photosensitive  
 

material in such a manner that the projection exposure 
by the projection exposure unit and the exposure by 

the image exposure unit are effected in an overlapping 
manner onto the photosensitive material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer.One conventional invention known as an image
printer for exposing a photosensitive material with an
image recorded on a film is as follows
JP-A-63-189262).That is, aside from an ordinary image printer for
projecting and exposing a film image on a
photosensitive material, a further image printer is
known. In this printer, image information of a film
is read with dividing the image information into a
number of areas and an exposure amount is set for each
of the number of areas. The photosensitive material
is exposed with the exposure amounts of the respective
areas being adjusted by an electronic shutter
comprised of PLZT or liquid crystal elements operable 
in correspondence with each of the number of areas.Different from the image printer operable through
projection-exposure, such image printer described
above is capable of effecting a variety of processing
on the read image information since the image
information is processed as a number of divided areas.
Such processings include, for instance, correction of
contrast or of color tone of the read image
information.However, while the above-described convention is
convenient as being capable of effecting a variety of
processings on the read image information, since the
exposure of the photosensitive material is effected
with an exposure amount being set for each of a number
of areas, there tends to occur the inconvenience that
the image produced through the exposure on the
photosensitive material shows, in a micro view, a
zigzag contour portion in one direction of the image
corresponding to the configuration of the picture
elements constituting the number of areas thereby to
deteriorate the image quality.EP-A-0 305 327 is directed to a process and apparatus for the production of
photographic images of transparent masters, wherein the master is reproduced in
a first beam path by means of a light source and optical means on photographic
material, and a second beam path for color and contrast correction by means of
CRT controlled by image measuring means and a computer unit as a mask in a
coincident manner. This apparatus does not include a controller for controlling
the operations of the projection exposure unit, the image exposure unit and of the
transport means and an exposure-mode instructing means for instructing said
controller, an image exposure unit for dividing the match information to be
exposed into the photosensitive material into a plurality of lines and then
exposing each line, wherein the

<CLAIMS>
An image printer comprising:

a projection exposure unit(5) for projecting and exposing an image of a film frame
onto a portion of a photosensitive material (3);
an image exposure unit (I) for exposing said portion of the photosensitive material (3) based
on exposure image information for setting a further exposure amount for each of

a number of areas of said portion of the photosensitive material (3);
a transport means (T) for transporting the photosensitive material (3)
through the projection exposure unit (5) and the image exposure unit (I);
a reader means (15) for reading the image information of the film frame by dividing
the image information into said number of areas;
a correction information inputting means (J) for inputting a correction-target
portion in the image information read by the reader means (15) and a

correction content for the correction-target portion;
wherein, based on the image information read by the reader means (15) and
on correction information instructed by said correction information inputting

means (J), said image exposure unit (I) generates, as said exposure image
information, image information concerning only said correction-target

portion corrected in accordance with said correction content;
characterized by
a controller (100) for controlling the operations of the projection exposure
unit (5), the image exposure unit (I) and of the transport means (T); 
an exposure-mode instructing means (E) for instructing said controller (100)
to be switched over between a double exposure mode and a projection exposure

mode;
said image exposure unit (6) being arranged to divide the image information to be exposed
onto the photosensitive material (3) into a plurality of lines and then to expose

each line sequentially ;
said transport means (T) being adapted to transport said photosensitive material (3) sequentially by a distance corresponding to one of said lines;
wherein with an instruction of the double exposure mode, said controller
(100) executes a control scheme for effecting the exposure of said portion of the photosensitive material at the projection

exposure unit (5) and the further exposure of said correction target portion at the image exposure unit (I) in
an overlapping manner onto the photosensitive material (3) when the exposure at the projection exposure unit needs contrast correction; whereas, with

an instruction of the projection exposure mode, said controller (100) executes
a further control scheme for effecting the exposure of said portion of the photosensitive material only at the projection exposure

unit (5) when the exposure at the projection exposure unit does not need contrast correction;
