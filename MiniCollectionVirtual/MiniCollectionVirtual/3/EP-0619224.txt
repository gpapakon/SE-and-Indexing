<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to aircraft technology and, in particular, to the construction and aerodynamic shape of light multi-purpose aircraft. The light multi-purpose aircraft has a fuselage 1 with a cabin 2 in the centre in whose rear part a pusher propeller is arranged in an annular casing 3 (in whose rear part a pusher ducted-fan is arranged). The front part of the fuselage is provided with an oscillating horizontal stabiliser 4 of the canard type. The wing of the aircraft is coupled and consists of a lower wing 5 and a higher wing 6 of opposite sweep. The ends of the wings are connected with the aid of an arrow-shaped pylon 8 which is provided with rudders 9. As a result of the new construction, the aircraft has a high lift capability and good stability.
