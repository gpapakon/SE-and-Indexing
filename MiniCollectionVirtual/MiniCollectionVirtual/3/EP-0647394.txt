<ABSTRACT>
System consisting of a non-absorbent mineral litter and of a device making it possible to increase its efficacity over time by sterilising processing and regular and automatic drying of the water from urine and faeces. The invention relates to a process making it possible to increase the longevity and the efficacy of mineral litters for small domestic pets by rapid and active drying of the grains making up this litter. It consists of a rectangular tray (1) having a central orifice (lower chimney) (2). In this tray, at mid-height, a slotted floor (3) is arranged, with a more or less loose frame supporting the bottom (4) containing the treated non-absorbent mineral litter (7). A low-power (20-40 watt) electric radiator (5), fed with 12 volts is placed under the slotted floor (3) and heats the air of this enclosure, creating a vertical convection, the hot air escaping via the upper chimneys (6).   The urine of the cat dissolves the adsorbed bactericidal products, and releases the perfumes contained during its vertical travel. On contact with the bottom (4), the urine diffuses laterally in a very rapid way, creating a patch of large diameter which is rapidly dried by the hot air flowing in this enclosure. On contact with this bottom, the urine also undergoes bactericidal treatment and releases a perfume into the air current of the lower enclosure. By the rapid drying of the litter as well as by the bactericidal and perfuming action, the device described allows preservation and enhancement of the performance of non-absorbent mineral litters for small domestic pets.
