<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ethylene/propylene copolymer rubbers
(EPRs), which include ethylene/propylene copolymers (EPMs) and
ethylene/propylene/ethylidene norbornene terpolymers (EPDMs),
generally having a crystalline content of less than about 15 percent by
weight, and a process for their production.The EPRs are elastomeric copolymers and terpolymers used in
such applications as hose and tubing, wire and cable, gaskets, and
single ply roofing. They are usually formulated with fillers, oils,
processing aids, and stabilizing agents, and cured by reacting the
polymers with sulfur in the presence of accelerators or with a
combination of sulfur and an organic peroxide such as dicumyl
peroxide.These polymers are presently manufactured commercially in
solution and slurry processes with soluble vanadium catalysts. The
processes are very expensive to run, requiring solvent removal and
steam stripping steps. In addition, these solution catalysts do not
provide satisfactory particle morphology in a fluidized bed.
Improvement in these processes would be desirable and, particularly,
the development of a gas phase process to produce these same products
would be more economically attractive because little post-reaction cost
will be incurred.One of the catalysts selected to produce the EPRs in the gas
phase is described in United States patent 4,508,842. This catalyst is
one of several conventional catalysts useful for the production of
polyethylene, and it would be commercially advantageous to have a
catalyst, which, not only can be utilized in the production of
polyethylenes having good properties, but can also be used successfully
for the production of EPR's. Typically, the catalyst described in the above-mentioned
United States patent is comprised of a catalyst precursor, which is the
reaction product of vanadium trichloride and an electron donor, the
precursor being reacted with an aluminum containing modifier, and
impregnated into a silica support; a promoter such as chloroform; and
a triisobutylaluminum cocatalyst. This catalyst does achieve good
particle morphology, but poor overall product, e.g., EPRs made with
this catalyst exhibit poor cure and contain much high temperature
crystallinity. This is believed to be the result of poorly distributed
propylene, and, in the case of the EPDMs, poorly distributed diene.
Adjustments with respect to the cocatalyst and the promoter were
found to improve the propylene distribution and lower the high
temperature crystallinity somewhat, but only a marginal improvement
in
