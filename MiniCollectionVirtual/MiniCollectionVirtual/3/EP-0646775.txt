<ABSTRACT>
A device is proposed, for angular position detection of a shaft, in particular a gearbox selector shaft of a speed-change gearbox for a motor vehicle, in which a support arrangement supports a magnet and, in proximity thereto, magnetically sensitive detectors. A shielding (screening) device which is rigidly connected to the shaft, moves in the intermediate space between the magnet and the detectors. This shielding device is equipped with ferromagnetic materials such that the magnetic field passing through the detectors is influenced so that the sensors produce a signal unambiguously characterising the position of the shaft.

Device for detecting the angle of rotation of a shaft (1), in 
particular of a gearshift shaft of a change-speed gearing for a motor 

vehicle, wherein the position of the shaft is contactlessly scanned 
by means of magnetically sensitive sensors (6) installed in the 

gearbox (5) and at the location of the sensors (6) the magnetic field 
strength alters in dependence upon the position of the shaft (1), 

having the following features: 

a) a U-shaped carrier arrangement (4) having a first and second 
limb is provided, 
b) a magnet (10) is disposed on the first limb of the carrier 
arrangement (4) in such a way that its polar axis extends 

parallel to the first limb, 
c) a pair of sensors are disposed on the second limb of the 
carrier arrangement (4) in the spatial vicinity of the magnet 

(10) on a line parallel to the polar axis of said magnet in 
such a way as to be permeated by the magnetic field, 
d) there is further disposed, at the side of the second limb of 
the carrier arrangement (4) remote from the magnet (10), a 

screening plate (9) made of ferromagnetic material, 
e) a screening device (8) is further provided, which is rigidly 
connected to the shaft (1), said screening device (8) being 

disk-shaped and moving in the gap between the first and second 
limb of the carrier arrangement (4), and

influence the magnetic field penetrating the sensors in a 

predetermined manner for each sensor (6) such that the sensors 
(6) produce a signal clearly characterizing the position of the 

shaft (1).
