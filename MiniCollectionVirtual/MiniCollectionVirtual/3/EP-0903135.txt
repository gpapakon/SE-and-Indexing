<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article including a liquid-retentive absorptive layer formed on a
liquid-impermeable, leak-preventive layer in a substantially elongated configuration,

the absorbent layer including a liquid-permeable top sheet and a liquid-retentive
absorbent member, and the absorbent article is provided longitudinally with left and

right opposite side portions containing elastic members which extend in the
longitudinal direction thereof, wherein the elastic members are covered with an

elastic member-attached sheet provided on an inner surface side of the top sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent article as defined in the preamble of claim 1, such as a sanitary napkin
or an incontinent pad.The absorbent article of the present invention renders no adverse effect to the skin of the user due to
the oozing-out of an adhesive agent. The absorbent article is also superb in fitness
and high in its leak-preventive effect. WO-A-97/09016 and EP-A-534 488 describe absorbent articles of the type as defined in the preamble of claim 1, having a topsheet, a
backsheet and an absorbent member enclosed therebetween. The top and back sheets
extend beyond the lateral sides of the absorbent member and are attached to each
other in this region. The attachment region is covered by one or more separate sheets
to form lateral cuffs which may include elastic means. The sheets are intended to make
the cuffs compliant and soft to the skin.EP-A-219 326 describes an absorbent article having lateral cuffs. In one embodiment
the cuffs contain absorbent material and are provided with elastic means. The elastic
means are enclosed within a fold of the combined back and top layers which are extended
beyond the absorbent member and which are attached to each other to form the
cuffs. As an absorbent article such as a sanitary napkin and the like, there has
heretofore been widely used one including a liquid-retentive absorptive layer and a
liquid impermeable leak-preventive layer and formed in a substantially vertically
elongated configuration.In such an absorbent article, the absorbent layer usually comprises a liquid-permeable
top sheet and a liquid-retentive absorbent member. Recently, it has been
proposed, in order to enhance the fitness and leak-preventive property, that the elastic
members should each be disposed on opposite left and right side edge portions of the
absorbent member.However, since it is the usual practice that the elastic member is adhered to
the top sheet and the absorbent member through an adhesive agent directly applied to
the elastic member, the conventional absorbent article such as a sanitary napkin and
the like provided with such an elastic member has the shortcoming in that the
adhesive agent oozes out to the top sheet to reach the surface of the top sheet where
the adhesive agent contacts the skin of the wearer which degrades the perception of
wearing. In a worst case, the adhesive agent even adversely affects the skin of the
wearer. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an absorbent
article which is superb in fitness and in

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article (1) including a liquid-retentive absorptive layer (2) arranged
on a liquid-impermeable, leak-preventive layer (3) in a substantially elongated

configuration, said absorptive layer (2) including a liquid-permeable top sheet (23)
and a liquid-retentive absorbent member (24), wherein said absorbent article (1)

is provided on longitudinal left and right opposite side portions thereof with elastic
members (25) which extend in the longitudinal direction thereof, said elastic

member (25) being covered with a sheet (28) disposed on the inner surface side
of said top sheet (23), 
characterised In that
 said sheet is an elastic member
attached sheet (28), said absorbent member (24) includes a free edge portion

(22), provided with said elastic member (25), said elastic member-attached sheet
(28) is disposed in such a manner as to cover front and back sides of said free

edge portion (22) of said absorbent member (24), and said elastic member (25) is
fixed to said elastic member-attached sheet (28) by an adhesive agent (29), with

one surface of the elastic member (25) contacting the absorbent member (24)
and the other surface contacting the elastic member-attached sheet (28).
The absorbent article according to claim 1, wherein said absorptive layer (2) has a
central fixture portion (21) and lateral side portions.
The absorbent article according to claim 1, wherein said elastic member-attached
sheet (28) is formed of a nonwoven fabric.
The absorbent article of claim 2, wherein the lateral side portions define said left
and right free edge portions (22) which extend outwardly and upwardly from said

centrally disposed fixture portion (21) due to the contraction of the elastic
members (25).
The absorbent article of claim 2, wherein the lateral side portions are extensions
of the central fixture portion (21). 
The absorbent article of claim 2, wherein lateral side portions are independent of
the central fixture portion (21).
