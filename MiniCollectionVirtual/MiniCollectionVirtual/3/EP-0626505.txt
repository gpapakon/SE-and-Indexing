<ABSTRACT>
A muffling and denitrating apparatus (1, 20, 50, 70) 
comprises a hollow body (2) having exhaust pipe connection 

ports (11, 12); 

(a) a muffling and denitrating section (4, 23, 54) 
including a cover member (6, 24, 76) made of a perforated 

metal and arranged to hold a layer of carbon fibers or 
particles (7, 25, 54a, 54b, 77); 
(b) a soot reservoir section (9, 32) arranged in said 
body at the lower portion of said body and provided with 

heating means (10, 34); and 
 
   at least one rectifying plate (8, 30, 78) formed with 

a plurality of through-holes (16,17) via which automobile 
exhaust gas pipes are insertable and arranged so as to 

divide a space defined in said body by cooperation between 
said sections (a) and (b) into spaces (A, B). 
A dust collecting mechanism may be arranged in an 
exhaust gas discharge path. 
Preferred carbon fibers have a fiber diameter of 0.5 
to 15 µm and carbon particles are formed into a 

substantially spherical shape having a particle diameter of 
0.01 to 2 mm. The modified carbon may be prepared by 

contact with nitrogen monoxide gas or nitric acid. 
The NO
x
 in the exhaust gas from the engine is thereby 
converted into N₂ and CO₂ and the soot is adhered to the 

carbon layer and is burned to CO₂.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a muffling and denitrating 
apparatus for reducing the exhaust sound generated by a 
combustion engine and concurrently reducing the 
concentration of nitrogen oxides contained in the exhaust 
gas from the engine. Also, the present invention relates 
to a muffling and denitrating apparatus equipped with a 
dust collecting mechanism for removing particles from the 
exhaust gas. Further, the present invention relates to 
modified carbon fibers or carbon particles used for the 
muffling and denitrating apparatus and a process for 
producing the same. In various kinds of combustion engines including, 
particularly, a moving combustion engine such as an 
automobile or the like, sound-damping or a decrease in 
noise attendant upon the generation and discharge of 
exhaust gas from the combustion engine, and denitration or 
a decrease in concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the 
exhaust gas are highly desirable. A conventional muffler in an automobile exhaust system 
contains a plurality of rectifying plates for sound-damping. 
Unfortunately, such arrangement of rectifying 
plates causes the back pressure to be increased, resulting 
in the combustion efficiency of the automobile being 
substantially decreased, so that the fuel consumption 
efficiency is reduced. One of the denitrating devices which have been 
conventionally known uses a noble metal catalyst made of 
noble metal such as platinum or the like. Unfortunately, 
platinum is highly expensive and readily poisoned by 
impurities contained in exhaust gas of a combustion engine, 
resulting in the catalytic performance of the catalyst 
being impaired. In particular, this leads to a failure in 
the use of the catalyst for a diesel engine. Also, there is 
known denitration using carbon fibers, as described in the 
Proceedings of the 69th National Convention Lecture of the  
 
Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, "1508 Research of 
Denitrating Apparatus by New Material", 11 October 1991, pp 
450-452. However, denitration still requires improvements 
such as an improvement in denitration performance of the 
material and improvement in the denitrating apparatus. A conventional engine for an automobile generally 
employs a denitrating device using a catalyst which is 
rendered active at an elevated temperature. The denitrating 
device is installed at a high temperature site in proximity 
to an outlet of the engine. Also, the engine is provided 
with a muffling device, which is located at a position of 
reduced temperature on a
