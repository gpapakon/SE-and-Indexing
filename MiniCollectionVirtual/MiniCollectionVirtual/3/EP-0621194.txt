<ABSTRACT>
A case arrangeable in a single plane includes a back wall (10), a 
cover (12), a top wall (14) hinged between the back wall (10) and the 

cover (12), two side panels (20,30) oppositely hinged to the back wall 
(10) and each foldable to form a column, a front wall (40) secured to 

the back wall (10) and folded to form a space between the back wall (10) 
and the front wall (40). Paper or documents may be received in the 

space. A front panel (60) may further be secured to the front wall (40) 
so as to form another space between the front wall (40) and the front 

panel (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a carrying case, and more 
particularly to a carrying case which can be easily 
assembled by the users. Typical carrying cases comprise a plurality of 
panels, lugs, ears, plates, etc., which are assembled 
and fixed together by the manufacturers who spend a lot 
of time for assembling, fixing and adhering the parts 
together so as to form the carrying cases. This greatly 
increases the manufacturing costs thereof. In addition, 
the users may not assemble the carrying cases by themselves. The invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate 
the afore-described disadvantages of the conventional 
carrying cases. The objective of the invention is to provide a 
carrying case which includes a simplified configuration 
and can be easily assembled by the users. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a case arrangeable in a single plane 
comprising a back wall, a cover, a top wall secured 
between the back wall and the cover and folded to be 
perpendicular to the back wall and the cover respectively, 
two side panels oppositely hinged to the back 
wall and each foldable to form a column, at least one 
first slot formed between the back wall and each of the 
side panels, a front wall, a bottom wall secured 
between the back wall and the front wall and folded to  
 
be perpendicular to the back wall and the front wall 
respectively, the front wall including a pair of bands 
oppositely formed therein and secured to the columns 
respectively, and each of the bands including at least 
one ear extended therefrom for engaging with the first 
slot so as to secure the front wall to the columns, 
whereby, a space is formed between the back wall and 
the front wall for receiving objects. Further objectives and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from a careful reading of the 
detailed description provided hereinbelow, with appropriate 
reference to the accompanying drawings. 
FIG. 1 is a plane view of a sheet material which 
can be easily folded and assembled to form the carrying 
case; FIG. 2 is a perspective view illustrating the 
folding processes of the carrying case; and FIGS. 3 and 4 are perspective views illustrating 
the carrying case which has been assembled, in which a 
panel of the carrying case as shown in FIG. 3 is folded 
inward of the carrying case, and the panel of that 
shown in FIG. 4 is folded outward. Referring to the drawings, a carrying case is made 
of or arrangeable in a sheet material as shown in FIG. 
1, the sheet material is

to a position in parallel to said front wall, said 

front panel including at least one engaging member 
extended therefrom for engaging with said third slot so 

as to secure said front panel to said front wall, 
whereby, a second space is formed between said front 

wall and said front panel. 
A case according to claim 5, wherein said front 
panel includes at lea
st one flap extended therefrom for 
engaging with said second slot so as to further secure 

said front panel to said front wall. 
A case according to claim 5, wherein said front 
wall includes at least one door formed therein such 

that said objects may be inserted into said second 
space via said door.
