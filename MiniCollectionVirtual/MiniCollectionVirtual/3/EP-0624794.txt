<ABSTRACT>
In a method for detecting defects (14) with a 
surface ultrasonic wave in which a surface ultrasonic wave 

probe (4) is brought into contact with a surface of a rotating 
cylindrical member (2) via a thin film of a contact 

liquid medium (15) such that a contact trace of the probe 
(4) extends linearly or in the shape of a linear ribbon in 

a rotational direction (A) of the cylindrical member (2), 
and an ultrasonic wave propagates in the surface portion 

of the cylindrical member (2) from the probe (4) in an 
opposite direction (16) to the rotational direction (A) of 

the cylindrical member (2), the probe (4) is provided in a 
front portion (12) thereof with a projection means (121) 

slightly extending downward from a lower surface of the 
probe (4) so that the thin film of the contact liquid 

medium (15) is stably formed, and that there is substantially 

no thin film of the contact liquid medium on a 
surface of a portion of the cylindrical member (2) in 

which the surface ultrasonic wave propagates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surface ultrasonic wave probe
and apparatus for use in an ultrasonic inspection method for
automatically detecting defects such as cracks, voids, scratches, etc.
in a surface portion of a cylindrical member such as a roll for hot- or
cold-rolling, a roller for conveying various articles, etc.The detection of defects in the surface portion of a
metal member is mainly conducted by the following methods:While an ultrasonic probe is manually scanned on a
member to be tested in contact with the member, an ultrasonic
beam is generated from the probe to cause a surface ultrasonic
wave to propagate through a surface portion of the member to
detect defects therein. However, since the probe is moved
manually, the test takes many steps and an operator of the probe
should have high skill. In addition, measurement errors easily take
place because manual operation is not always the same.An ultrasonic wave is generated from a tire-type
probe to automatically detect defects in a surface portion of a
cylindrical member to be tested. In this method, a thin film of a
contact liquid medium should be formed in advance on a surface of
the cylindrical member with which the tire-type probe is brought
into contact. Also, since there is a large attenuation in a ultrasonic
wave, high detection sensitivity cannot be obtained for fine defects.Defects are detected by the change of eddy current.
This method is widely utilized because it can easily be automated.
However, the changes of metal texture, hardness, magnetic
properties, etc. are also detected together with the defects, and
closed cracks are not detected. Accordingly, the reliability of this
method is lower than that of the manual defect-detecting method
with a surface ultrasonic wave (1). Particularly, in the case of a
roll, etc., only a low detection sensitivity is obtained for fine defects.A member is etched with nitric acid and hydrochloric
acid to observe by the naked eye the difference in color between
different metal textures of the member. However, this method has
problems that acids are used, that the interior of the member
cannot be inspected, that cast iron cannot be inspected, and that
automatic inspection cannot be conducted.Defects opening on a surface of a member to be tested
are detected by using a penetrating liquid and a developing liquid
which can penetrate into the defects by a capillary action.
However, this method cannot be conducted efficiently, and shows
only a low reliability for fine defects.As described above, among the
