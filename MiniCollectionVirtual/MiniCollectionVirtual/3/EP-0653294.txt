<CLAIMS>
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre, comprising one
or more carcase plies (8, 9), which are disposed one above

the other, of reinforcing members (15, 16) which are each
embedded in rubber,


wherein one ply is formed from a carcase ply piece
or from a plurality of adjacently disposed carcase ply

pieces (8', 8'', 9', 9'') provided with parallel textile
reinforcing members (15, 16), at least two ends of carcase

ply pieces, orientated in the circumferential direction of
the carcase, are held together in abutment with each other

in an overlap-free manner in a connection region.
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 1,


comprising means for maintaining a permanent
contiguous contact between the two interconnected end

regions (8', 8'', 9', 9'').
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 2,


wherein the means for maintaining a permanent
contiguous contact are seam regions (19, 19'), which hold

together the end regions.
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 1 or 2,


comprising end regions which are intimately
interconnected.
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 4,


comprising end regions which are vulcanised
together by prevulcanisation.
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 5,


comprising a single-ply or multiple-ply carcase
with textile reinforcing members (15, 16),
of which at least one ply is vulcanised together in
end regions by prevulcanisation, and the end regions are

vulcanised together, at least with one additional adjacent
ply.
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 6,


wherein the adjacent ply is the lower ply.
Carcase of a pneumatic vehicle tyre according to
the features of claim 6,


wherein the adjacent ply is the internal layer.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre from a carcase ply piece or from a plurality

of carcase ply pieces provided with parallel textile
reinforcing members (15, 16) embedded in rubber, wherein

ends of carcase ply pieces (8', 8'', 9', 9''), which are
disposed in the pneumatic vehicle tyre adjacent one another

when viewed with respect to the circumferential direction,
are joined together so as to abut each other with a

contiguous contact and are subsequently interconnected by
being held together.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to the features of claim 9,


wherein ply end regions (8', 8'', 9', 9'') are sewn
together after being joined to one another.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to the features of claim 9,


wherein ply end regions (8', 8'', 9', 9'') are 
intimately interconnected after being joined to one

another.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to the features of claim 11,


wherein ply end regions (8', 8'', 9', 9'') are
vulcanised together by prevulcanisation after being joined

to one another.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to one or more of claims 9 to 11,


wherein ply end regions (8', 8'', 9', 9'') are
permanently interconnected prior to the ply being placed

upon the winding drum for the construction of the tyre.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to the features of one or more of

claims 9 to 11,

wherein ply end regions (8', 8'', 9', 9'') are
interconnected after being placed upon the winding drum for

the construction of the tyre.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to the features of claim 11,


wherein, after the ply end regions (8', 8'', 9',
9'') have been joined together, at least one vulcanising

apparatus is moved into a spacing from the connection
region, such spacing being required for prevulcanisation,

and said apparatus is then moved along the connection
region during the prevulcanisation.
Method of producing a carcase ply of a pneumatic
vehicle tyre according to the features of claim 11,


wherein, after the ply end regions (8', 8'', 9',
9'') have been joined together and prior to the

vulcanisation, a vulcanising apparatus, which extends over
the entire connection region of the two ply end regions, is 

moved into a spacing from the connection region, such
spacing being required for prevulcanisation.
