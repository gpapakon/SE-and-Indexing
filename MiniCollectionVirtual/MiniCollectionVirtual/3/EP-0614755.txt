<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an oriented multilayer polyolefin film which comprises a base layer essentially containing polypropylene, and at least one heat-sealable top layer. The base layer contains a tertiary aliphatic amine and an amide of a water-soluble carboxylic acid having 8 to 24 carbon atoms. The heat-sealable top layer contains SiO2. The multilayer film is essentially free from silicone oil. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the multilayer polyolefin film and to the use of the film.

<CLAIMS>
An oriented multi-layer polyolefin film comprising a base layer comprising a
tertiary aliphatic amine and an amide of a carboxylic acid with 8 to 24 carbon atoms, and

at least one sealable outer layer which contains SiO
2
, characterised in that the SiO
2
 is
reprocessed with a coating which contains 0.5 to 5% by weight of an aliphatic carboxylic

acid, based on the weight of the particles and the multi-layer film is free from silicon oil
and in that after being printed on, cut, laminated, coated, metallised and/or embossed, the

film has a lower coefficient of friction than prior to processing, the coefficient of friction
following processing being in the range from 0.12 to 0.3.
A multi-layer polyolefin film according to claim 1, characterised in that the SiO
2

has a mean particle diameter of 2 to 5 µm.
A multi-layer polyolefin film according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that the base layer contains 0.03 to 0.25% by weight (based on the weight of the base

layer) of tertiary aliphatic amine.
A multi-layer polyolefin film according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the base layer contains 0.1 to 0.3% by weight (based on the weight

of the base layer) of amide.
A multi-layer polyolefin film according to one or more of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the outer layer contains 0.2 to 0.5% by weight (based on the weight

of the outer layer).
A multi-layer polyolefin film according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the processing comprises the printing or lining of the multi-layer film. 
A process for the production of the multi-layer polyolefin film according to
clam 1 in which the melts corresponding to the individual layers of the film are coextruded

through a flat-film die, the coextruded film is taken over via a take-off roll whose
temperature is between 80 and 110°C, the film is biaxially stretched at a longitudinal

stretching ratio of from 4:1 to 7:1 and transverse stretching ratio of from 8:1 to 10:1, the
biaxially stretched film is thermofixed and subsequently wound up.
A process according to claim 7, characterised in that at least one surface of the
film is corona-treated.
Use of a multi-layer polyolefin film according to one or more of claims 1 to 6
as a packaging film.
Use of a multi-layer polyolefin film according to one or more of claims 1 to
6 for further processing, preferably for printing and/or lining.
A laminate comprising a multi-layer polyolefin film according to one or more
of claims 1 to 6 and paper or cardboard or at least one further film of a synthetic

thermoplastics substance.
A process for further processing a multi-layer polyolefin film according to
claim 1, characterised in that the film is subjected to a processing stage and in that after

processing the film has a lower coefficient of friction than prior to processing.
A process according to claim 12, characterised in that after processing the
coefficient of friction of the film is 
<
 0.3, preferably 0.12 to 
<
 0.3, and in that the
processing stage comprises printing, cutting, laminating, coating, metallising and/or

embossing and/or the processing on packaging machines.
