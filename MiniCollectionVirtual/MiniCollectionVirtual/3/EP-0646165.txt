<DESCRIPTION>
 DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING LIPASE AND WATER-SOLUBLE QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to detergent compositions having enhanced soil removal properties, particularly of triglyceride-containing soils.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEnzymatic detergent compositions are well known in the art. In particular, upases have been described as possible enzymes from detergent compositions in several patent publications; representative of such disclosures are US 4011 169, describing the use of upases in the preparation of additives for washing agents, as well as EP-A- 205 208, EP-A-206390 or EP-A-341 999, all relative to specific detergent compositions containing lipase as a soil-removal agent.The production of lipase from certain microorganismes has been described in e.g. EP-A-214761 and EP-A-258068.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 On the other hand, the use of certain water-soluble quaternary ammonium compounds in detergent compositions exhibiting textile cleaning and softening properties is known; in particular, EP-A- 26529 describes such detergent compositions, where the presence of certain water-soluble quaternary ammonium compounds provides benefits in terms of fabric cleaning and softening.It has now been found that the combination of lipase enzymes with certain water-soluble quaternary ammonium compounds, unexpectedly increases the removal of triglyceride-containing soils from fabrics, and provides soil-anti- redeposition effects not previously achievable from the use of either or the combined species above.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to detergent compositions comprising a surface-active agent, a water-soluble quaternary ammonium compound of the formula:(i) R-|R2R3R4N+ X- wherein R-j is Cs - C- Q alkyl or is R5-T-C-R6, wherein T is O, NH or N-C-|_4O alkyl, R5 is a divalent C1-C3 alkylene group or (C2H4θ)m, wherein m is a number of from 1 to 8, wherein each of R2, R3 and R4 is independently C-| - C4 alkyl or hydroxyl alkyl, benzyl, or - (C2H4θ)xH where x has a value from 2 to 5, not more than one ofR2, R3 or R4 being benzyl and X" is an anion, or:(ii) ^(CH2)χ X"Q. N-R2 wherein n is 2, 3, or 4, preferably 2 Q is CH, CH2, or N r + and R-| and R2 are the same as in formula (i).IRl X " and X" is an anion. characterized-in, that the compositions additionally contain a lipase enzyme.The quaternary ammonium salts above are preferably selected from species in which R-| is C12-C15 alkyl and R2, R3 and R4 are preferably selected from methyl and hydroxyethyl
