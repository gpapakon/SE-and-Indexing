<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
lightweight I-beam bumper for a vehicle, 
as specified in the preamble of claim 1 and as disclosed, for 
example, in US-A-4 482 180. Current automotive bumper systems generally 
consist of a C-shaped beam which spans the vehicle 
front rails. Loads experienced by the beam in a low 
speed collision (typically 2.5 to 5.0 mph) are passed 
to the front rails of the vehicle. In order to prevent 
damage to the components protected by the bumper 
system, the kinetic energy is absorbed by the bumper 
system. Other components such as hydraulic 
attenuators, absorptive foams or egg-crating type parts 
are usually added to help dissipate system energy. 
Multi-step processing is required because the present 
bumper systems are made up of several different types 
of materials. United States Patent 4,762,352, for example, 
discloses a bumper assembly with a front made of fiber 
reinforce thermoplastic resin, a back up beam and a 
layer of foam between the face and the back up member. 
Each of these parts are made of different materials and 
requires a separate processing step to form the bumper. United States Patents 4,635,984, 4,586,739 
and 4,616,866 teach a bumper construction having a 
semi-rigid resilient face and a rear mounting member. 
An impact absorbing foam is layered between the two 
pieces. During a collision, the outer face deforms and 
compresses the foam dissipating at least some of the 
energy of the impact.  
 United states Patent 4,482,180 
discloses a bumper system which comprises an I-beam 
having a resilient outer covering and one or more 
layers of an energy absorbing foam between the I-beam 
and the outer covering. Finally, United States Patent 4,762,352 again 
discloses a bumper having an inner support beam with a 
resilient outer cover. An impact absorbing foam is 
placed between the beam and the cover with an air space 
between the cover and the foam. The backup beam is a 
hollow tube made of fiber reinforced thermoplastic 
resin. Each of these designs is made up of several 
different components each formed from different 
materials. This means that many different steps are 
required to produce a single unit of limited 
effectiveness. These multiple steps and different 
materials add significantly to the cost of producing 
each vehicle. In addition, they add to the weight of 
the vehicle reducing the fuel efficiency of the 
vehicle. In addition, as seen in the patents discussed 
above, most of the currently produced composite bumper 
beams have cross
