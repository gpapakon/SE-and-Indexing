<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
system for detecting a displacement between an
objective lens and a surface to be measured and more
particularly, to the system using the optical
astigmatic method.The non-contact measuring method such as the
optical astigmatic method, critical angle detecting
method, or knife edge method is conventionally known,
which serves to measure a displacement between the
objective lens and the surface to be measured, or a
shape and roughness of the surface. A displacement
detecting system using such measuring method includes,
for example, a non-contact surface roughness tester
which uses an absolute level of a focus error signal
to detect a displacement between the objective lens
and the surface to be measured, and a focusing-type
non-contact displacement detecting system which
includes a drive arranged to the objective lens so as
to make the latter follow the surface through feedback
control of a focus error signal, detecting a
displacement between the two through the drive.Fig. 9 shows a constitution of the displacement
detecting system disclosed in JP-A 4-366711. This
system is a focusing-type non-contact detecting system
with a scale. Referring to Fig. 9, an optical
detector, designated generally by reference numeral 1,
is arranged to detect through light reflected by a
surface 6 to be measured a deviation of a distance
between an objective lens 5 and the surface 6 from a
focal length. An actuator 16 is arranged to move the
objective lens 5 in the direction of an optical axis
21 in response to an output of a light receiving
element 7 of the optical detector 1 so that the
distance between the objective lens 5 and the surface 
6 is equal to the focal length. A linear scale 20 is
disposed on an axis 22 which is in line with the
optical axis 21 of the objective lens 5, and
integrally mounted to the actuator 16 so as to move
together with the objective lens 5. The optical
detector 1 comprises a laser diode 2, a beam splitter
3, and a mirror 4 in addition to the light receiving
element 7.The conventional displacement detecting system
operates as follows: The optical detector 1 detects
a deviation of the distance between the objective lens
5 and the surface 6 from the focal length through
light reflected by the surface 6, and the actuator 16
moves the objective lens 5 in the direction of the
optical axis 21 so that the distance between the
objective lens 5 and the surface 6 is equal to the
focal length in response to an output of the light
receiving element 7 of the
