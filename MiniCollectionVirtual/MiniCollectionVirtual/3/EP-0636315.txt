<ABSTRACT>
A composition comprising hydrotalcite-like 
compound intercalated with an organic anion such as 

organic sulfonic anions, sulfuric acid ester anions, 
phosphoric acid ester anions, carboxylic anions and N-acylamino 

acid anions and various active agents such as 
pesticidal active agents, for example an insecticide, a 

fungicide, a repellent, etc. and a perfume supported by 
said hydrotalcite-like compound, can release an active 

agent gradually over a long time while retaining the 
active agent stably for a long time, so that it has a 

long acting effect and can be used for various 
applications such as a pesticidal formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent-slow 
releasing composition. More particularly, it relates to 
a composition comprising an organic anion-intercalated 
hydrotalcite-like compound and an agent, and to a method 
for slowly releasing an agent by using said composition. Hydrotalcite is a natural mineral found in 
Ural of Russia and Snarum of Norway. In the past, it 
was not well studied because these have been found few 
uses for hydrotalcite, the use as antacids was only 
major use found for it. However, it has recently been found that it 
can be used as additives for plastics and rubbers. 
Since then the compounds having crystal structure 
similar to that of hydrotalcite (the so-called 
hydrotalcite-like compounds or hydrotalcites) have 
generally been investigated. The present invention provides the 
hydrotalcite-like compounds with a new application, that 
is a use as a carrier or vehicle for slow-releasing 
compositions of agents. The present inventors have found that the 
hydrotalcite-like compounds which have been intercalated 
with an organic anion or anions can stably retain agents 
such as pesticides and gradually release the active 
agents, thereby producing the effects of the active  
 
agents for a long period of time. Thus, the present invention provides a 
composition comprising a hydrotalcite-like compound 
intercalated with an organic anion and an active agent 
supported thereby. It also provide a method for control 
of pests by releasing an active agent by using said 
composition. In the present invention, "the hydrotalcite-like 
compounds" means hydrotalcite or the compounds 
having crystal structure similar to that of 
hydrotalcite, including those hydrotalcites reported in 
Gypsum & Lime, No. 187 (1983), p. 333-339. In this 
article, they are described as unfixed-ratio compound 
represented by the formula (1), 
wherein M²⁺ is a divalent metal cation, M³⁺ is a trivalent 
metal cation, An- is an n-valent anion, and x is in the 
range of 0 ≦ x ≦ 0.33. A metal cation represented by M²⁺ includes 
magnesium ion, manganese ion, iron ion, cobalt ion, 
nickel ion, copper ion, zinc ion, etc., a metal cation 
represented by M³⁺ includes aluminum ion, iron ion, 
chromium ion, cobalt ion, indium ion, etc., and an anion 
represented by An- includes a hydroxyl ion, carbonic ion, 
fluorine ion, chlorine ion, bromine ion, nitric ion, 
sulfuric ion, etc. A preferred organic anion used in the present  
 
invention is a relatively bulky anion, and the desirable 
bulkiness of it is of such a degree
