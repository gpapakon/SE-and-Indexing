<CLAIMS>
A device for administering implants, comprising an
active substance container (1) with injection

cannula (6) and plunger (4), the plunger (4) being
arranged in a plunger channel (3) which merges with

continuity into the lumen of the cannula (6), and a
holder device (5) for the implant (2) being arranged

at the lumen-side end of the plunger channel (3),
wherein the holder device (5) is designed such that

it can move out of the way of the implant (2) and
can clear the plunger channel (3).
The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the holder
device (5) comprises two elastic pins (7, 8) which

are arranged opposite one another and which in each
case have a rounded end (11) protruding into the

plunger channel (3).
The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the holder
device (5) comprises two spring-loaded pins (7, 8)

which are arranged opposite one another and which in
each case have a rounded end (11) protruding into

the plunger channel (3).
The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the holder
device (5) comprises at least one spring-loaded

ball, preferably two spring-loaded balls (9, 10)
arranged opposite one another and protruding into

the plunger channel (3) via their spherical caps
(13).
