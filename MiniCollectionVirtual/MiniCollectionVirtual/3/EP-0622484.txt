<ABSTRACT>
The device consists of a housing (1) and of a plurality of brake bodies (2) which are arranged as a loose filling in the housing. A thread is guided through the filling via a deflecting member (6), so that the thread is surrounded by the brake bodies. The thread is thereby braked, so that a thread advance is prevented and any kinks (11) in the thread are eliminated as a result of the braking.
