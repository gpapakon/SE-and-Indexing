<ABSTRACT>
A method of assaying for non-familial Alzheimer's disease in a live patient, by preparing washed platelets from the blood of the patient; inserting a pH probe in the platelets in the form of a fluorescent dye such as 2',7'-bis (carboxyethyl)- 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; inhibiting alkalinization of platelet response by blocking Na+/H+ transfer across the platelet membranes with dimethyl amiloride; stimulating the platelets with (alpha)-thrombin so that the cytoplasm of the stimulated platelets shows a characteristic acidification response or change in cytoplasmic pH; measuring the cytoplasmic pH of the platelets following stimulation; and comparing the measured pH with the corresponding stimulated cytoplasmic pH in platelets from normal individuals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY FOR NON-FAMILIAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASEThis invention was made during the course of work supported in part by the U.S. Government, and the government has certain rights in the invention. This invention relates to an assay, and more particularly to an assay for detecting the presence of Alzheimer's disease in living patients. Alzheimer's disease (hereinafter AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, presently affecting an estimated four million people in the United States alone. Two types of AD are recognized. A first is Familial Alzheimer' s Disease (FAD) which is genetically linked, generally exhibits an early onset and may be caused by a faulty gene for the Alzheimer's precursor protein, βAPP, on chromosome 21 leading to an altered βAPP sequence. The other type of AD has a later onset, is more common, does not appear to be familial, and the βAPP is normal. AD is distinguished and defined by the presence of mature, senile plaques with a central core containing the 4.5 kDa amyloid β -protein (β/A4) which is obtained by proteolytic processing of its amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). The latter is synthesized in neural as well as non-neural mammalian cells and has a highly conserved sequence. The detection, in autopsy, of β/A4 plaques and of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain has, to date, been the primary definitive diagnosis of the disease. In living patients, diagnosis has only been approached by using a set of behavioral and psychological criteria, or made by assay that detects depletion of Alzheimer's precursor protein in spinal fluid as described by Van Nostrand et al., (1992) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sciences 89, 2551. It is known that relatively large quantities of amyloid precursor protein exist in the α- granules of human platelets together with growth factors and other proteins. While it has been shown that the platelet βAPP in non-familial Alzheimer's diseased patients has exactly the same sequence as that in normal controls, some abnormalities in platelets from such patients have been reported: altered membrane fluidity specific to platelets and attributed to altered internal membranes but not to abnormal phospholipid synthesis, and a report that platelets from such patients exhibit an enhanced Ca++ response to thrombin, tentatively attributed to a large storage pool, a report with which the data presented in this specification do not agree. Platelets are one of several cellular components of blood and when appropriately

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is: 1. Method of assaying for non-familial Alzheimer's disease in a live patient, comprising the steps of: collecting platelets from the blood of said patient; stimulating said platelets with a physiological agonist so that the cytoplasm of said platelets shows a characteristic acidification response; measuring the maximum extent of said response immediately following said stimulation; and comparing the measured maximum extent of said response with the corresponding stimulated acidification response in platelets from individuals not suffering from non-familial Alzheimer's disease.
2. Method of assaying as defined in claim 1 wherein said agonist is α-thrombin.
3. Method of assaying as defined in claim 1 wherein said agonist is selected from the group consisting of thrombin, collagen, adenosine diphosphate, epinephrin, ristocetin and mixtures thereof.
4. Method of assaying as defined in claim 1 wherein said step of measuring comprises so using a pH-sensitive probe that the change in cytosolic acidification upon stimulation can be determined by said probe.
5. Method of assaying as defined in claim 4 wherein said probe is a fluorescent material which can be emplaced within the platelet cytoplasm.
6. Method of assaying as defined in claim 5 wherein said material is 2' ,7'-bis (carboxyethyl)- 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein.
7. Method of assaying as defined in claim 5 wherein said material is 5(6)- carboxyfluorescein.
8. Method of assaying as defined in claim 5 wherein said platelets are incubated with 


an ester of a fluorescein derivative that can pass freely across the platelet plasma membrane and will be cleaved in situ by cytoplasmic esterases to generate said fluorescent material.
9. Method of assaying as defined in claim 8 wherein said ester is 2' ,7'-bis (carboxyethyl)- 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester.
10. Method of assaying as defined in claim 8 wherein said ester is 5(6)- carboxyfluorescein diacetate.
11. Method of assaying as defined in claim 1 including the step of treating said platelets with an agent to block Na
+
/H
+
 exchange across the membranes of said platelets.
12. Method of assaying as defined in claim 11 wherein said agent is dimethyl amiloride.
13. Method of assaying as defined in claim 11 wherein said agent is amiloride.
14. Method of assaying as defined in claim 11 wherein said agent is an amiloride derivative.
