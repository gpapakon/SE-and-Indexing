<ABSTRACT>
Plate for cell cultures with a system for laterally diffusing molecules 
through a barrier membrane consisting of two or more compartments 

(wells) separated by means of one or various barrier membranes situated 
in the contiguous side wall or walls, providing for the passage of 

soluble substances through the membranes, and retaining the insoluble 
particles and the cells. The cells deposited in one of the compartments 

may interchange their metabolic products with one or various contiguous 
compartments containing a culture medium or other cells. The problem 

caused by other devices wherein the diffusion of substances occurs between 
a higher compartment (which usually contains the cells) and a lower compartment, separated by a barrier membrane, making 

difficult the microscopic observation of the cells and the manipulation thereof, is thus solved. The fields of application include 
various branches of biology, such as immunology, pharmacology, toxicology, microbiology and paracytology.

<DESCRIPTION>
A cell culture plate with a system for lateral diffusion of molecules across a barrier 
membrane. In the course of biological experimentation, it is frequently necessary to culture one or 
several cell populations at high cell density and under low oxygen concentration. In such 
circumstances it is necessary to use special techniques, with the aim of supplying 
metabotically active cells with the necessary nutrients and of maintaining pH within 
physiological limits. To date, these objectives have been achieved either by daily supplementation of 
cultures with fresh nutrients and with a alkaline substance which corrects the excess 
acidity of the culture procedure A), or by the use of special culture plates in which the  
 
cells are cultured on a permeable membrane, the cell metabolites passing across this 
membrane into a reservoir of culture medium (procedure B). The two procedures described have two major disadvantages: Under procedure A, the metabolites produced by the cells are not removed, and thus 
may accumulate to levels which are toxic for the cultured cells. The procedure is very 
time-consuming, and the need for daily handling of cultures increases the risk of 
contamination. The daily addition of an alkaline substance in order to correct pH leads to 
abrupt fluctuations in this parameter, and this may prove harmful to the cultured cells. Under procedure B, the need to culture cells on a permeable membrane makes it 
difficult or impossible a) to harvest the cells (particularly cells that adhere to the 
membrane), b) to examine the cells under a microscope (since observation must be across 
both the culture medium reservoir and the membrane), and c) to carry out multistage 
cultures (eg. in situations when is necessary to maintain the cells in contact with given 
substance for a given period of time). In the culture plate fitted with a lateral diffusion system (Figure 1), two flat-bottomed 
open-topped wells, denominated the reservoir well and the diffusion well, communicate via 
two slits situated in the lateral wall/s of the diffusion well. Each of these slits is covered by 
a semipermeable membrane which permits the transfer of soluble substances, but not of 
insoluble substances or cells, between the two wells. Transfer of cell metabolic products 
from the diffusion well to the reservoir well, and of culture medium from the reservoir well 
to the diffusion well, may thus occur. In existing apparatuses based on basal diffusion, in 
which substances diffuse across a semipermeable membrane
