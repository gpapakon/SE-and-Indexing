<ABSTRACT>
An optical fibre-connecting device includes a passageway which is funnel-shaped at both ends thereof and with which an optical fibre is intended to be inserted from either end into the passageway, so that the fibres will meet one another therein. The invention is characterized in that the connecting device (1) includes a first silicon part (7) having a flat surface in which one or more grooves (8) of V-shaped cross-section have been etched; in that the connecting device (1) includes a second part (9) which is made of transparent glass and which has a flat side that is intended to abut the grooved surface of the first part (7) so as to form a channel of triangular cross-section, wherein a circle inscribed in the channel will have a diameter which is only slightly larger than the outer diameter of an optical fibre (5, 6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connecting device
for optical fibres.When optical fibres are used as information carrying
media, it is often necessary to join the fibres
together and also to connect the fibres to light-transmitting
and light-receiving units.The present invention relates to a device for mutually
connecting different kinds of fibres. Thus, the inventive
connecting device can be used to join both
plastic fibres and glass fibres.A connecting device which is comprised essentially of
an homogenous cylinder having a through-penetrating
hole which extends along the cylinder axis is known to
the art. At each end of the cylinder, there is
provided a funnel-shaped recess which is symmetrical
with respect to the cylinder axis and which leads to
the throughpassing hole. The connecting device is made
from a non-transparent material.When using this known device, the ends of respective
fibres are inserted into the funnel-shaped recess and
then guided into the throughpassing hole, so as to
meet one another within the device.This known fibre-connecting device is expensive to
manufacture and is encumbered with several decisive
drawbacks. One drawback is that it is difficult to
achieve sufficient precision with regard to the
diameter of the throughpassing hole. The hole diameter
should be precise to a tolerance of less than about 1
micrometer in order for the fibre ends to meet one
another in the manner desired, i.e. with sufficient
overlap of the fibre cores. Another drawback is that
the connecting device is intended only for one single 
join. A further, serious drawback is that it is not
possible to see or check the positions of the fibre
ends in the fibre- connecting device.US 4,950,048 shows an optical connector comprising two
ferrules, where one fibre is inserted in one ferrule,
and another fibre in a second ferrule, whereafter the
ferrules are connected to each other via a connector.
Funnel-shaped parts at one end of each ferrule leading
to guide grooves in the ferrules are resin-molded.There is an apparent drawback with this device, namely
that several parts are involved in order to connect
two fibres to each other.US 4,475,790 shows a coupler where two complementary
opposed V-grooves from a channel. The channel is
provided with a thin layer of deformable hard glass
lining in order to allow variations in fibre size. The
two parts of the coupler is bonded together after that
the fibre has been inserted. This is a very great
disadvantage. Further, it is expensive to manufacture
because many
