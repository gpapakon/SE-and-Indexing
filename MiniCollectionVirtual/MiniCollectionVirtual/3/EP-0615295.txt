<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a uni-morph,
bi-morph or other types of piezoelectric or electrostrictive
element as disclosed in JP-A-5-29675 (corresponding to U.S.
Patent Application Serial No. 07/912,920), which undergoes
displacement in the form of bending, deflection or flexure
and which can be suitably used for ink jet print heads,
microphones, sounding bodies (such as loudspeakers), various
resonators or vibrators, sensors, and other components or
devices. The terms "piezoelectric element" and
"electrostrictive element" used herein are interpreted to
mean an element capable of transducing or converting an
electric energy into a mechanical energy, i.e., mechanical
force, displacement, strain or vibrations, or transducing a
mechanical energy into an electric energy.In recent years, in the fields of optics and
precision positioning or machining operations, for example,
there have been widely used and increasingly demanded an
element whose displacement is controlled for adjusting or
controlling an optical path length or the position of a
member or component of a device on the order of fractions of 
a micron (µm), and a detecting element adapted to detect
infinitesimal displacement of a subject as an electric
change. To meet the needs, there have been developed or
proposed various piezoelectric or electrostrictive actuators
or sensors utilizing a piezoelectric or electrostrictive
material such as a ferroelectric material, which exhibits
the reverse or converse piezoelectric effect or the
electrostrictive effect, in which such a piezoelectric or
electrostrictive material produces a mechanical displacement
upon application of a voltage or electric field thereto, or
which exhibits the piezoelectric effect in which the
piezoelectric material produces a voltage or electric field
upon application of pressure or mechanical stress.For example, an ink jet print head uses
conventional piezoelectric/electrostrictive elements of a
uni-morph or bi-morph type, so as to effect a printing
operation utilizing displacement of the elements. In order
to improve the quality and speed of the printing operation,
efforts have been made to reduce the size of the
piezoelectric/electrostrictive elements so as to form these
elements with higher density, and lower the required drive
voltage for displacing the elements, assuring improved
operating response of the elements. In the piezoelectric or
electrostrictive elements of modern vintage, a lower
electrode, a piezoelectric/electrostrictive film and an
upper electrode are
