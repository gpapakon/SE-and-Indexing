<ABSTRACT>
A microminiature piezoresistive pressure transducer (12) has first (RA) and second (RB) variable resistive elements. Circuitry (51) is coupled to the variable resistive elements of the transducer, and includes third (RF1) and fourth (RF2) fixed resistances of known values. The first (RA) and third (RF1) elements are coupled to an amplifier (61) and analog-to-digital converter (41), and the second (RB) and fourth (RF2) elements are coupled to a separate and independent amplifier (76) and analog-to-digital converter (42). Thus, the analog-to-digital converters (41, 42) have indepedent outputs with digitized voltages thereon, having a pressure component and a temperature component. A computer (46) coupled to the outputs of the analog-to-digital converters (41, 42) ascertains the unknown first (RA) and second (RB) variable resistances as independent variable resistance elements in solving a set of equations having these variable resistances elements as unknowns and pressure and temperature as the remaining unknowns to provide a temperature compensated pressure value as measured by the microminiature pressure transducer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PIEZORESISTIVE PRESSURE TRANSDUCER CIRCUITRY ACCOMMODATING TRANSDUCER VARIABILITYThis invention relates to a piezoresistive transducer circuitry accommodating transducer variability and having reduced dynamic range requirements.Conventional pressure transducer systems, both strain gauge and piezoresistive types, typically utilize a balanced Wheatstone bridge-type circuit between two variable and two fixed resistive elements. The transducer itself may contain only the two variable resistive elements or all four resistive elements. Typically the resistive elements are trimmed during manufacture to ensure a close tolerance to and match between the nominal zero-pressure resistance values. The resistive elements are also trimmed to provide a close match between individual pressure-resistance characteristics. Electrical circuitry typically utilized therewith permits a small adjustment to the value of one of the fixed resistors by adding a small offset voltage to one of the output legs of the bridge. The demodulated amplified output can then be supplied to an analog-to-digital converter. With such circuitry, typically the dynamic range of the amplified signal is matched to the input of the analog-to-digital converter and only 9 bits (1 part in 512) of resolution is needed in the analog-to-digital converter to provide adequate pressure resolution 

(resolution better than 1 mmHg from 0-300 mmHg or over a 0-300 mmHg span as typically required for human blood pressure measurements) . With the advent of ultraminiature pressure sensors such as that disclosed in the co-pending application Serial No. 08/300,445 filed on September 2, 1994, it has been found that the conventional Wheatstone circuitry of the type hereinbefore described is incapable of assimilating the various characteristics of such ultraminiature pressure sensors such as insensitivity to pressure, variability of resistor values, sensitivity to temperature, and with pressure sensitivity decreasing inversely with temperature increases. There is therefore need for a new and improved circuitry for use with such ultraminiature pressure sensors which can accommodate such variabilities.In general, it is an object of the present invention to provide piezoresistive pressure transducer circuitry and method accommodating transducer variability.Another object of the invention is to provide circuitry which makes it possible to measure the pressure component and the temperature component of the change in resistance of each variable resistor.Another object of the
