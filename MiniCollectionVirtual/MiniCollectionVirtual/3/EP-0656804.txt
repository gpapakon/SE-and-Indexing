<ABSTRACT>
System (10) for separating solids from slurry (12) from a source (14). The slurry (12) is flowed into a separation channel (20) positioned over a moving foraminous medium (26) to effect cross flow separation of liquid from the slurry (12) in an initial channel section (21) followed by separation of solids from the slurry (12) in a second channel section (23), all the separation being effected employing the moving foraminous medium (26). The flow rate of slurry (12), the rate of travel of the foraminous medium (26), and the differential pressure across the foraminous medium (26), as established by the pressure exerted by the flowing slurry on the foraminous medium (26) and the relative pressure underneath the foraminous medium (26), are controlled in different compartments (34a-34d) underneath the length of the separation channel (20) to provide optimum steady state separation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for
separation of solids from liquids and particularly to a
cross-flow liquid/solid separation system for treating a
slurry to isolate solids and liquids for collection.Industry generates vast amounts of unsewerable
waste streams each year which contain components which must
be removed before disposal. These components often have
value for sale or reuse. For example, in the coal
industry, waste waters often contain significant amounts of
coal fines. Removal of the fines from the water is
difficult and expensive because of the small particulate
size of the fines and because the fines have ionic forces
which cause them to adhere to the water molecules. It is
desirable to remove the coal fines from the water because
environmental regulations prohibit the disposal of such
waste streams without proper pretreatment. In addition,
the recovered fines, and the water which is substantially
free of the fines, are valuable for reuse.In a typical prior art filtration process, a
liquid having solids suspended therein is disposed on a
filtration medium whereupon the liquid preferentially flows
through the pores of the filtration medium, leaving a
portion of the solids deposited as a layer on the surface
of the medium. In this conventional filtration process,
the pores through the filtration medium commonly define
elongated tortuous pathways through the thickness of the
filtration medium. The mechanism of filtration then
becomes one of entrapment of the solid particulates within
the pores and consequential buildup of a layer of solids on
one surface of the medium. As is well recognized in the
art, this mode of filtration results in the passage of
substantial quantities of fine (small) solid particulates
to escape through the filtration medium with the liquid so
that frequently the filtrate containing the solids must
again be processed to clarify the filtrate. These fines
and other small solid particles so clog the filtration
medium as to require close attention to cleaning of the
filtration medium in order to maintain a reasonable 
continuous system of filtration. Even so, the system is
greatly limited to throughput, size of particulates which
may be separated, rate of separation, etc.US-A-4 285 816 discloses an apparatus for separating solids
from a slurry, wherein an endless foraminous screen is used as a
filter surface. Due to the prevailing vacuum at the lower side
of the screen the liquid is drawn through the screen, whereas
the solids are deposited onto the screen. Other

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for separating liquid and solid from
a slurry (12) which contains solids within a liquid

carrier comprising:

means (14, 18) providing a source of said slurry,
means defining an elongated separation channel (20)
having closed top and opposite side walls (132, 133,

134), said channel being adapted to receive said slurry
at one end thereof and convey the same along the length

thereof,
dam means (38) dividing said separation channel (20)
into an initial length portion (21) and a second length

portion (23) which is located downstream of said initial
length portion (21) whereby flow of slurry along said

initial and second length portions is adjustable to
different values,
substantially planar foraminous means (26) defining
a lower wall of said separation channel (20) whereby

slurry contained within said channel is disposed in
contact with said foraminous means,
means (35, 60, 62, 64, 66) for moving said foraminous
means (26) forwardly relative to said separation

channel (20),
means (48, 50) causing said slurry to flow along
said initial portion (21) of the length of said separation

channel (20) at a first flow rate, said flow rate
being sufficient to establish and maintain solids contained

within said slurry suspended and swept along with
said flowing slurry, and thereby prevented from accumulating

in, or inhibiting flow of liquid from said slurry
through the foramina of said foraminous means (26) which

is disposed along said initial length portion (21) of
said separation channel (20),
means (90, 31, 34a, 34b) for developing a differential
pressure of a first value across said foraminous 

means (26) along said initial portion (21) of the length
of said elongated channel (20) whereby liquid is caused

to flow from said slurry through said foraminous medium
(26) during the time of residence of said slurry within

said initial length portion (21) of said separation
channel (20),
means (38, 159) for directing a portion of the flow
along said initial portion (21) of the length of said

elongated channel (20) to said second length portion (23)
of said separation channel,

along said second length portion (23) of said separation

channel (20) to second value which is lower than said
first value,

pressure across said foraminous means (26) along

said second length portion (23) of said separation channel
to a second value which is higher than said first

value of said differential pressure, the combination of
said higher differential pressure with said flow of

slurry along said second length portion (23) being sufficient
to cause said solids in said slurry to be captured

on that surface of said foraminous means (26) facing said
slurry in said second length portion (23) of said separation

channel (20) to define a layer of solids (152) on
said foraminous means, and

foraminous means (236) comprises a foraminous filtration

medium.

means (90, 31, 34a, 34b) for developing said differential

pressure along said initial length portion (21) of said
separation channel (20) at said first value comprises

means (48, 50) for conducting the slurry into the initial
length portion (21) of said separation channel (20) under

comprises orifice means (150) for imparting turbulence to

the flow of slurry, the orifice means being positioned
within said enclosed separation channel and projecting

into said channel in the flow path of said slurry moving
within said channel.
The apparatus of any of claims 1-7, which includes
flow restrictive means disposed within said separation

channel and serving as a dividing location between
said initial length of said separation channel and its

first value of differential pressure and said second
length portion of said separation channel and its second

value of differential pressure.
The apparatus of any of claims 1-8, wherein said
foraminous means moves along said initial and second
