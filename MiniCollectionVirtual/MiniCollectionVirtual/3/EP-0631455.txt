<ABSTRACT>
A virtual connection initially set up within a first packet switching network (PVN1) is released from the faulty location through to the originating and destination switching devices when a connection fault occurs. A call packet is then generated from the originating switching device, following the occurrence of which an alternative connection including a second packet switching network (PVN2) is set up towards the destination switching device. The relevant call packet and signalling packets and data packets following the former, of the relevant virtual connection are then transparently transmitted in data packets of the alternative connection within the second packet switching network.
