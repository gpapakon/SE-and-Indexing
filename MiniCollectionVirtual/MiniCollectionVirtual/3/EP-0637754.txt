<ABSTRACT>
This meter comprises means for measuring the discharge 
current and terminal voltage of a battery; a data table 

showing the values of available capacity which are expressed 
by combinations of the values of different discharge currents, 

and the values of the terminal voltages, and prepared on the 
basis of the values measured in advance; storage means for 

storing the data table; and means for displaying on a display 
the value of the available capacity by reading the capacity 

from the storage means in accordance with the terminal current 
and voltage values when the battery is in use. The value 

of the available capacity is defined as the ratio of the total time 
during which the discharge with a constant current is possible 

at from the initial voltage in the fully charged condition 
to the final voltage, and the remaining time during which the 

discharge of constant current is possible at from the value of 
the measured terminal voltage to the final voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a remaining capacity meter of
a battery to be used as a driving source for electric motor
vehicles, and particularly to a battery remaining capacity
meter with which a usable capacity of the battery being used
can be easily understood.A battery is generally used as a driving source for an
electric motor in an electric motor vehicle such as an
electric car. Several different methods are known for
detecting the remaining capacity of the battery. Such
methods can be classified into either 1) direct detection or
2) indirect detection of the remaining capacity.Specifically, the first classification uses the
relationship between the following essential battery
characteristics and the battery remaining capacity. These
characteristics include the open circuit voltage.
electrolyte density, the electrode potential of a pair of
reference electrodes, the pH value of the electrolyte.
partial pressures of various gases in the cell, relative
humidity in the cell dead space, the electrolyte viscosity,
and the refractive index of the electrolyte. A numerical formula representing the relation between
these characteristics and the remaining capacity varies
depending on the type of battery. Specifically, a sealed
lead acid battery is generally recognized to have a linear
correlation between the remaining capacity and the open
circuit voltage. For example, in a 30-Ah sealed lead acid
battery, a 13V open circuit voltage corresponds to 27Ah,
12.4V to 15Ah, and 11.8V to 2Ah. A remaining capacity meter
using this correlation is described in detail in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open Print No. 57-149144.An apparatus based on the relation between the density
and the refractive index of the sulfuric acid electrolyte of
a lead acid battery has also been used widely to detect the
remaining capacity (e.g.. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
Print No. 63-274064 and Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open Print No. 1-260769). According to this method, a
special probe is inserted into the battery to measure the
refractive index of the sulfuric acid electrolyte. The
remaining capacity is calculated from the detected values.The second classification, indirect detection of a
remaining capacity, calculates a remaining capacity by
measuring either the output current of the battery or the
output current and voltage of the battery when the battery
is being used as an energy source. This detection method
mainly uses the well known PEUKERT equation, InT=C. In the 
formula, I stands for the discharge current, n for
