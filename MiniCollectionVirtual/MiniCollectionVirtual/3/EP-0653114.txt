<ABSTRACT>
A device for removing the insulating powder that adheres to the outer surface (16) electrostatically coated with powder of the bundle of laminations (14) of the armature (10) of an electric motor has a clamping tool (30) operationally linked to a driving unit (32) for clamping the armature (10) to the armature shaft (12) and for rotating the armature (10) around the clamping axis (x). A doctoring strip (42) arranged underneath the bundle of laminations (14) of the clamped armature (10) may be moved perpendicularly to the clamping axis (x) and applied to the outer surface (16) of the bundle of laminations (14). In order to remove the insulating powder from the sleeves (34, 36) that cover the ends of the armature shaft (12), the device has a doctoring template (54) which corresponds to the outer contour of the covering sleeves (34, 36) and which may be upwardly applied on the covering sleeves (34, 36) which rotate on the armature shaft (12) around the clampin axis (x). Several clamping tools (30) with mutually parallel clamping axes (x) form a clamping unit (31) and a number of clamping units (31) which corresponds to the number of machining stations (A, B, C, D, E, F) are mounted on a rotary base (28).
