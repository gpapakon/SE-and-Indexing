<ABSTRACT>
An information data composed of a predetermined 
quantity converted from input data and an information data 

parity for use in detecting or correcting an error in the 
information data are formulated. An ID comprising information 

including position information indicative of a position of the 

information data relative to a recording medium, and an ID 
parity for use in detecting or correcting an error in the ID 

are formulated. Then, a sync pattern is formulated, followed 
by formulation of a sync block comprised of the sync pattern, 

the ID, the ID parity, the information data and the information 
data parity. A plurality of the sync blocks are connected together 

to provide a recording area. This recording area forms 
a track together with other recording areas. Three or more 

consecutive tracks forms a minimum editing unit with which 
recording or reproduction is carried out. Each minimum editing 

unit has a plurality of the sync blocks having the same information 
data, and the plural tracks forming each minimum editing 

unit includes at least one track other than those positioned on 
respective opposite sides of the minimum editing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital data
recording method and apparatus for recording and/or reproducing
digital data and a digital data reproducing apparatus.A digital recording/reproducing technology has
recently been utilized in various field of industry, particularly
in a digital audio-video application, and digital video
devices of D1 or D2 type have come to be utilized in rotary
head systems for business use.In view of an advance made in high-density recording
technology and image compression technology such as MPEG, it
has been longed for development of a compact, high performance
inexpensive digital video device for home use.Information data (hereinafter referred to as time
codes) representative of position information such as information
for use in search of contents recorded on a length of
magnetic tape and/or time information in the digital video
device of either D1 type or D2 type are standardized as LTC
(Linear Time Code) which is recorded by a fixed head and VITC
(Vertical Interval Time Code) which is recorded in superimposed
fashion with image data.Since LTCs are recorded by the fixed head in parallel
relation to the direction of travel of the length of magnetic
recording tape, they can be properly reproduced even during a
high speed reproduction. On the other hand, reproduction of
VITCs at a high speed is correlated with the length of sync 
blocks which is a unit of recording of data and can therefore
be reproduced at a speed some tens times the normal speed.The digital video device is discussed in detail in
"19-mm type D-1 Cassette-Tape Record" (March, 1986, SMPTE J.,
95, 3) and "The Composite Digital Format and its Application"
(October, 1987, SMPTE J., 96,10).However, the LTC of the existing structure requires
the use of, in addition to the rotary head for recording audio
and video signals which are a main signal, a fixed head dedicated
for LTC, resulting in an increase of costs. This also
has a problem in that the number of recording areas in the
length of magnetic recording tape tends to increase since a
linear track is necessitated in the length of magnetic recording
tape for accommodating time codes.With respect to VITC, since the VITCs are recorded
superimposed with the image data, they cannot be reproduced at
a high speed and, in addition, only the VITC time codes cannot
be recorded again.These problems are extremely detrimental to the
existence of the data recording apparatus.EP-A-241 014 discloses the recording of time code in audio segments, which are
arranged so as to
