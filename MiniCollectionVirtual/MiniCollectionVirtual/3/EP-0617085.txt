<ABSTRACT>
A polyacetal composition is provided for use in plastic-plastic 
wear applications, said composition containing about 85 to 99 weight percent 

polyacetal, about 0 to 5 weight percent polytetrafluoroethylene fibers, about 
0.5 to 5 weight percent ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer, and about 0.5 to 

5 weight percent of at least one lubricant. The compositions are particularly 
useful in forming shaped articles for use especially in conveyor chain 

applications and gear applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyacetal compositions that are
especially useful in plastic-plastic wear systems. A wear system is one in
which the surface of one part of the system bears against the surface of
another part of the system, thereby causing friction and wear of each part.
In a plastic-plastic system, the parts of the system bearing against each other
are each plastic.More specifically, the present invention is directed towards the
use of polyacetal compositions containing ethylene methyl acrylate and a
lubricant, and optionally polytetrafluoroethylene fibers, in said wear systems.
The compositions are especially useful in wear systems due not only to their
excellent wear resistance, but also due to their ability to maintain
substantially constant wear resistance under varying maximum pressure
molding conditions. Further, it has been found that the compositions of the
present invention that contain pigments, said pigments often being added in
the final applications, also maintain substantially constant wear in the face of
varying molding conditions, especially maximum pressure molding
conditions.It is known that polyacetal compositions are used in plastic-plastic
wear systems, such as, in particular, conveyor chain systems. Conveyor
chains are well known in the art. Generally, they are made from a series of
links having flat tops, said links being connected to each other by pins. The
pins are in most cases made from stainless steel or plastic resins. The
conveyor chain links can be made from thermoplastic resin, such as
polyacetal resin. The conveyor chain links move on a guided rail and they
are driven by gear sprockets located on both ends of the conveyor chain line.
The gears can also be made of polyacetal resin.There are many types of conveyor chains. However, two types of
conveyor chains, the flat-top conveyor chain and the open hinge conveyor
chain, are predominant.Flat top conveyor chains move straightly and flexibly. They are
generally made of single width chain links having relatively limited contact 
with the driving gear sprockets. However, these chain links have noticeable
contact with guided rails, said rails usually being made of stainless steel or
wear resistant plastic resin. Flat top conveyor chain links are connected to
each other by pins, said pins also usually being made of stainless steel or
wear resistant plastics. Thus, in a flat top conveyor chain system, wear
occurs between the pin and the chain link, on the flat top surface due to
carried materials, on the part
