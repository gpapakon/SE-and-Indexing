A process for the preparation of a benzaldehyde 
dialkyl acetal of the formula I 


 
where R
1
 is C
1
-C
6
-alkyl, R
2
 is C
1
-C
6
-alkyl, C
1
-C
6
-alkoxy, 
halogen, cyano or carboxyalkyl where the alkyl group is 

of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, n is an integer of from 1 to 3 
and the radicals R
2
 may be identical or different when n 
is 
>
 1, by electrochemical oxidation of a substituted 
toluene compound of the formula II 


 
wherein a substituted toluene compound II is oxidized in 

the presence of an alkanol R
1
-OH and of an auxiliary 
electrolyte in an electrolysis cell, the reaction solution 

thus obtained is let down outside the electrolysis 
cell to a pressure which is from 10 mbar to 10 bar lower 

than the pressure in the electrolysis cell and 

A) in the batchwise procedure, the gas released from 
the reaction solution on letting down the latter is 

separated off and the reaction solution is recycled 
at least once to the electrolysis cell, subjected to 

electrolysis, let down, separated from the released 
gas and then worked up to obtain the product, or 
B) in the continuous procedure, some of the reaction 
solution is worked up to obtain the product and the  

 
remaining part of the reaction solution is mixed 

with an amount of the originally used reaction 
solution which corresponds to the part removed and 

is recycled to the electrolysis cell, subjected to 
electrolysis and let down. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a 
substituted toluene compound of the formula III 


 
where R
3
 is C

-alkoxy, is converted. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
reaction solution is let down to atmospheric pressure. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
reaction solution is let down to a pressure which is from 

0.1 to 6 bar lower than the pressure in the electrolysis 
cell.
