<ABSTRACT>
Referring to Fig. 2, the engine of a power driven mower and the 
drive to the mower are both controlled by a single bail (3) pivoted to 

the mower handle (2) . When the bail (3) is fully released, a switch or 
brake renders the motor inoperative. In a first position, the motor 

can operate but the drive clutch is disengaged and in a second 
position, the drive clutch is engaged. The bail (3) is so shaped that 

it is brought to the first position when it is grasped together with 
the sides of the handle (2) and to the second position when it is 

grasped together with the rear bar of the handle (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with power-driven mowers and provides a 
safety feature for such mowers. In power driven mowers apart from the controls for the engine itself 
a control lever is required to enable the operator to engage or 
disengage the drive to the land wheels or rollers which propel the 
mower forward. This control lever normally takes the form of a bail 
hinged to the mower handle so that it can be grasped together with 
the handle by the operator during mowing. It is a desirable feature and in some countries required by law that 
when a power mower is left unattended the engine of the mower or at 
least the cuter blades should be brought to a standstill. In the 
prior art this has been achieved by means of a second bail attached 
to the mower handle so that when the operator lets go of the handle, 
the bail is released and the engine is brought to a standstill by 
means of a switch or brake. Such an arrangement is complicated and 
confusing to the operator since he has to bear clearly in mind which 
bail performs which operation and he is likely to stop the engine 
unintentionally each time he momentarily wishes to disengage the 
drive. The present invention which is defined in the appended claims 
provides a simple arrangement which is not confusing to the operator 
which readily allows the drive to be disengaged without stopping the 
engine which is less complicated in that it involves only a single 
bail. The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view 
of a handle and bails of a mower according to the prior art. Figure  
 
2 is a diagrammatic side view of a control bail as used in the 
present invention. Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating the bail in 
its fully engaged position and Figures 4a and 4b show an additional 
feature which may be employed with the invention. Referring first to Figure 1 a mower has a handle (1) of generally 
U shape with the ends of the legs attached to the mower at the sides 
and with the bend of the U bent backwards to provide a bar (2) in 
a convenient position for grasping. A bail (3) is hinged to the 
handle and connected by a cable (4) to the clutch so that when the 
operator grasps the handle and pulls up the bail (3) the clutch is 
engaged and the mower moves forward. As a safety precaution a second bail (5) above the handle is 
connected by a further cable (6) to a switch or brake so that when 
the bail is in the position shown in the drawing the engine or

<CLAIMS>
A power driven mower including a handle and a power drive is 
controlled by bail means mounted on the mower handle characterised 

in that a single bail controls both the operation of a mower blade 
and the engagement of a self propulsion drive clutch and the bail 

is so shaped and connected to the mower handle that grasping the 
mower handle and bail together at the sides of the handle moves the 

bail into a first position which permits the operation of the blade 
and grasping the mower handle and bail together at an upper part of 

the handle further moves the bail into a second position in which 
it allows the self propulsion drive clutch to engage. 
A power driven mower in which the power drive is controlled by 
bail means mounted on a mower handle characterised in that a single 

bail controls both the running of the engine and the engagement of 
a drive clutch and the bail is so shaped and connected to the mower 

handle that grasping the mower handle and bail together at the sides 
of the handle moves the bail into a first position which permits the 

engine to run and grasping the mower handle and bail together at an 
upper part of the handle further moves the bail into a second 

position in which it allows the drive clutch to engage. 
A power driven mower according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the blade is driven through a blade clutch, and the blade clutch is 

engaged when the bail is in the first or second position. 
A power driven mower according to any preceding claim 
characterized in that the mower further comprises blade braking 

means which is disengaged when the bail is in the first or second 
position. 
A power driven mower according to claims 1, 2 and 4 
characterized in that the blade is mounted directly on a drive line 

 
of the engine and, when the bail is in the first or second position, 

the running of the engine operates the blade. 
A power driven motor according to claims 2, 4 
&
 5 
characterized in that the mower further comprises drive line braking 

means which is disengaged when the bail is in the first of second 
position. 
A power driven mower according to any preceding claim in which 
a toggle arm pivoted to the bail or to the handle prevents the 

accidental movement of the bail from the first to the second 
position. 
A power driven mower according to any preceding claim in which 
the running of the engine is controlled by a switch or a brake and 

both the self propulsion drive clutch and the switch or brake are 
operated by cables attached to the bail and are spring loaded so as 

to disengage the self propulsion drive clutch and stop the engine 
when the bail is released and the self propulsion drive clutch cable 

is attached to the bail in such a position that the spring 
tensioning 
the cable exerts little or no force on the bail when the 
bail is in the second position. 
A power driven mower according to any preceding claim driven 
by an electrically started petrol engine. 
A power driven mower according to any preceding claim 
characterized in that when the bail is released, operation of the 

blade ceases. 
A power driven mower according to claim 10 characterized in 
that when the bail is released, the blade braking means are engaged. 
A power driven mower according to claims 10 and 11 
 

characterized in that when the bail is released, the blade clutch 
is disengaged.
