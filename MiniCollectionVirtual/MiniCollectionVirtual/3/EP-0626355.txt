<ABSTRACT>
Wall material has a favorable sterilizing effect against Pseudomonous 
aeruginosa or MRSA (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aereus) which 

are main germs for hospital infection. The wall material having a 
sterilizing effect is characterized in that composite polymer emulsion 

including acrylic ester copolymer as main constituent and ceramic 
powder are mixed into mortar. Such wall material can drastically reduce 

not only Pseudomonous aeruginosa but also MRSA due to the favorable 
sterilizing effect of the composite polymer emulsion and the ceramic 

powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wall material having a favorable 
sterilizing effect against Pseudomonous aeruginosa or MRSA (methicillin 
resistant staphylococcus aereus) which are main germs for hospital 
infection and the method for using such a wall material. Generally, followings are considered to be mechanisms how the 
hospital infection occurs. 1 ○ Patients who do not have resistance against infection is 
increasing in number. 2 ○ Treatments or inspections which weaken the patient's resistance 
against infection have been applied to the patients. 3 ○ Medical treatments which hamper the normal defense mechanism of 
the patients are applied to the patients. 4 ○ Chemical treatment agents, especially multi-purpose antibiotics 
have been heavily dosed to the patients for a long time. 5 ○ The structure of hospital rooms, especially the wall and the 
floor of rooms promote the growth of Pseudomonous aeruginosa or MRSA. Among above mechanisms, upon focusing on the mechanism 5 ○, it is 
noticed that the conventional wall material of the hospital is mainly 
made of cement mortar layer and an ornamental material such as paint. The wall material, however, has following problems in terms of 
hospital infections. Namely, since the wall material is mainly made of mortar and the 
mortar has a great hygroscopicity, the front and rear surfaces of the 
wall material become the best place for promoting the growth of 
Pseudomonous aeruginosa or MRSA.  Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide 
wall material having a sterilizing effect which can overcome the above 
mentioned problems. It is another object of the present invention to provide various 
methods for effectivel utilizing the wall material having a sterilizing 
effect. This invention discloses wall material having a sterilizing effect 
characterized in that the wall material is made by mixing composite 
polymer emulsion including acrylic ester copolymer as main constituent 
and ceramic powder into mortar. In the above composition, mortar may preferably be made by mixing 
silica sand, iron oxide powder, zinc oxide and others into white cement 
or Portland cement. The composite polymer emulsion has a sterilizing effect against 
Pseudomonous aeruginosa or MRSA. The composite polymer emulsion may 
preferably be acrylic ester copolymer solutions including 25 to 50 % of 
solid components. The ceramic powder also has a sterilizing effect against 
Pseudomonous aeruginosa or MRSA. The ceramic powder may preferably be 
produced by firstly sintering
