<ABSTRACT>
A self-seating backshell includes a backshell 
body, a coupling ring, and a spring. The 

backshell body has a first plurality of teeth. The 
coupling ring is mounted on the backshell body for 

coupling the backshell body to an electrical connector. 
The electrical connector has a second plurality 

of teeth. The first plurality of teeth are arranged 
to seat against the second plurality of 

teeth. A spring retains the coupling ring on the 
backshell body and biases the first plurality of 

teeth into seating engagement against the second 
plurality of teeth even though the first plurality 

of teeth initially are not properly seated against 
the second plurality of teeth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-seating
connector adapter and, more particularly, to
a self-seating connector adapter which is arranged
to assure proper seating to a corresponding electrical
connector.An electrical connector is frequently used
to terminate a multi-conductor electrical cable.
The electrical connector may be either a male or
female plug or receptacle, and the conductors of the
multi-conductor electrical cable are terminated to
contacts of the electrical connector. This connector
is arranged to electrically mate with a corresponding
connector of an electrical apparatus.
Furthermore, a connector adapter, such as a backshell
having a backshell body and a coupling ring,
is frequently used in combination with an electrical
connector and its associated multi-conductor electrical
cable. The coupling ring of the backshell is
arranged to couple the backshell body to the electrical
connector. Backshells are formed in various configurations,
such as elbows, and are arranged to perform
one or more various functions, depending upon
their particular application. In an example of one
application, electrical connectors having backshells
coupled thereto are used extensively for the interconnection
of an aircraft's various control and/or
instrumentation functions. This application requires
such electrical connectors to be shielded
from electromagnetic interference and to withstand
substantial dynamic forces such as those arising
from vibration, shock, bending, and temperature
cycling. If electrical connectors are not properly
shielded, electromagnetic interference can result in
undesirable and potentially dangerous disruptions of
the control and/or instrumentation functions of an
aircraft. Similarly, if strain relief is not provided,
dynamic forces can cause strain on the electrical
conductors which, in turn, can cause dislocation
of the pins of the electrical connectors resulting
in a disruption or loss of an aircraft's
control and/or instrumentation functions. Backshells
have been arranged to provide electromagnetic
interference shielding and strain relief for such
electrical connectors and conductors.The coupling ring and the backshell body
of a typical backshell are arranged so that the 
coupling ring is held captive to the backshell body.
Accordingly, once the backshell is assembled, the
coupling ring cannot easily be removed from the
backshell body. The backshell may be provided with
an anti-rotation device in order to prevent rotation
between the backshell and the electrical connector
to

<CLAIMS>
A self-seating electrical adapter comprising
a backshell body (12), a coupling ring (14) for

coupling the backshell body (12) to an electrical connector
(50), and biasing means (36) cooperating with the

backshell body (12) and the coupling ring (14) for
biasing the backshell body (12) into proper seating

engagement against the electrical connector (50) even
though the backshell body (12) initially is not properly

seated against the electrical connector (50), characterized
in that the biasing means (36)

is a wave spring.
The self-seating electrical adapter of
claim 1 wherein one of the backshell body (12) and the coupling

ring (14) comprises a flange (22), the flange (22)
and the wave spring (36) being arranged to cooperate

in order to capture the coupling means (14) on the backshell
body (12) in a first direction. 
The self-seating electrical adapter of
claim 2 further comprising rotation resisting means

(42/44) for resisting rotation between the coupling ring
(14) and the backshell body (12).
The self-seating electrical adapter of
claim 3 wherein the rotation resisting means (42/44)

comprises rotation resisting elements (42) on the backshell
body (12) and a clip (44) on the coupling ring

(14), the rotation resisting elements (42) being arranged
so that, when the clip (44) engages the rotation

resisting elements (42), relative movement between the backshell
body (12) and the coupling ring (14) is resisted.
The self-seating electrical adapter of
claim 3 wherein the rotation resisting elements (42)

comprise teeth arranged around a perimeter of the backshell
body (12). 
The self-seating electrical adapter of
claim 1, wherein the wave spring (36) has an outer perimeter,

an inner perimeter, and first and second surfaces
extending between the outer and inner perimeters,

wherein the first and second surfaces are oppositely
facing surfaces, wherein the coupling ring (14) has a

recess (34) to receive the outer perimeter of the wave
spring (36), and wherein the first surface of the wave

spring engages the backshell body (12) in order to prevent
separation of the coupling ring (14) from the backshell body (12)

in the first direction. 
The self-seating electrical adapter of
claim 1 wherein the backshell body (12) has first engaging

elements thereon, wherein the electrical connector (50) has
second engaging elements thereon, wherein the first

engaging elements are arranged to seat against the
second engaging elements, wherein the backshell body (12) and

the coupling ring (14) are arranged without interference in
at least the first direction such that the backshell body (12)

and the coupling ring (14) are separatable in the first
direction, wherein the wave spring (36) biases the first

engaging elements into seating engagement with the
second engaging elements even though the first engaging

elements of the adapter body initially are not properly 
seated against the second engaging elements of the

electrical connector (50), and wherein the wave spring (36)
prevents separation between the coupling ring (14) and the backshell

body (12) in the first direction.
