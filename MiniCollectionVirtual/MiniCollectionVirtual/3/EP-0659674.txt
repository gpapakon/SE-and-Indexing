position for insertion of the yarn (F) on said yarn-holder cop (14) and 

means for cutting a lower branch of yarn (F3), comprising a cutting part 
(40) having a first and a second cutting element (42, 44) moving one in 

respect of the other for cutting the yarn (F), means (32) for trapping a 
lower branch (F3) of the yarn (F) and means for driving said cutting part 

(40) which can be actuated and are actuated mechanically by said yarn 
insertion part (42), with said yarn cutting part (40) which is arranged 

near said yarn-holder cop (14) at the point of insertion of the yarn (F) by

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the insertion of yarn on a
yarn-holder cop in automatic winding apparatus. It relates more
particularly to an improvement of means for cutting a damaging part of
yarn. The yarn insertion device comprises a part suitable for trapping a
yarn and for inserting it on the rotating winding cop of the same, which
moves between a normal backward rest position and a forward position
for insertion of the yarn on the cop, and means for cutting the yarn.Devices for automatically inserting yarn on a cop for winding a package
of yarn are already known
(see e.g. US-A-3165275).
In them the part for trapping and inserting
yarn generally traps the yarn by taking it at an intermediate point and
draws it, bending it into two sections or branches, namely into an upper
branch of good yarn for being wound on the cop and a secondary
underlying branch of yarn which is not suitable for being wound on the
cop.In fact this secondary branch of yarn is wound together with the
abovementioned good main branch and is damaging in that it winds
around the main yarn, more particularly around the section thereof 
which defines the tail or reserve of yarn, tangling it and making the
subsequent operation of yarn winding impossible or difficult, also due
to the fact that it prevents connection of the yarn reserve to a further
yarn package. The damaging secondary branch must therefore be cut
before it is drawn by rotation of the cop together with the good yarn to
be wound.In known yarn insertion devices
(see e.g. US-A-3097804),
the problem of cutting the damaging
branch of yarn has already been tackled, but has not been solved
satisfactorily as the parts used for cutting the yarn have been provided
far from the reel so that there was always a certain length of covering
yarn which hindered to a certain extent the winding phase and also due
to the fact that occurrence of the cutting action was not always ensured
therein.In fact in some known devices
(see e.g. US-A-4856722)
the parts for cutting the damaging branch
of yarn are actuated by means of systems with a pneumatic or
electromagnetic drive, so that a fault in such a drive system may involve
failure to cut the damaging branch of yarn with subsequent tangling of
the yarn being wound which leads to rejection of the package of yarn.Moreover, in other known devices, the parts for cutting the yarn are in
the form of individual blades whereon the branch of yarn to be scrapped
is rested and cut due to slight resting pressure and the considerable
sharpne

A device for insertion of yarn on a yarn-holder cop in winding
apparatus having a support bench (17), the device comprising: a part

(12) for trapping and inserting the yarn (F) on the cop (14) having a
portion (38) for trapping the yarn, said trapping and inserting part (12)

being supported on the bench of the winding apparatus and being
mobile in respect to the bench in a path disposed in a plane between a

backward rest position and a forward position, adjacent said yarn-holder
cop (14), for insertion of yarn (F) on said yarn-holder cop (14),

along which said path said trapping portion (38) traps said yarn (F)
causing it to be divided in an upper (F2) branch suitable for being

wound on the cop (14) itself and a lower branch (F3) which is damaging
for winding on the cop (14) and to be eliminated, and means (40) for

cutting said lower branch (F3) of the yarn supported on the bench (17)
of the winding apparatus and placed between said inserting part (12)

and said yarn-holder cop (14), adjacent to said yarn-holder cop (14) at
the point of insertion of the yarn (F) by said yarn trapping and inserting

part (12); in which said means (40) for cutting the lower branch (F3) of
the yarn (F) comprise a first stationary cutting element (42) and a

second movable cutting element (44) which define a recess between
them for receiving the branch of yarn to be cut (F3), said recess

between said first and second cutting elements (42,44) being oriented
towards said insertion part (12) in order to receive said lower branch

(F3)to be cut of the yarn when said insertion part (12) is in the forward 
position; in which elastic means(46) are provided for acting said first

and second cutting element (42,44) to maintain said recess open, in
