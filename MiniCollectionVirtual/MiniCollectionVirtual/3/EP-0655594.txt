<ABSTRACT>
A deodorizing device for a refrigerator is disclosed. The deodorizing device 
includes a deodorizing unit which is detachably mounted to a cooling air return port of 

a cooling chamber and sucks the cooling air laden with odor and bacteria thereinto by the 
blowing force of a cooling air fan. The deodorizing unit includes a cooling air grille 

provided with a plurality of cooling air through holes, a deodorant container provided on 
each side of the top surface of the grille, a guide cover detachably coupled to the grille 

for guiding the cooling air to the cooling air return passage, and a fixing plate for fixing 
the guide cover to an inner case of the freezing chamber so as to mount the deodorizing 

unit to the second cooling air return port. The fixing plate is placed on the top of the 
guide cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a refrigerator with a deodorizing device
and, more particularly, to a deodorizing device provided in a cooling chamber of the
refrigerator and deodorizing and sterilizing the cooling air of the cooling chamber, thereby
deodorizing and sterilizing the refrigerator.With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown in a side sectional view a refrigerator according to the preamble of claim 1, said refrigerator
having a typical deodorizing device. As shown in this drawing, the refrigerator includes
a freezing chamber 200 and a cooling chamber 300, which chambers 200 and 300 are
defined in the upper section and in the lower section of the interior of a refrigerator
casing 100 respectively. The front of the freezing chamber 200 is provided with a
freezing chamber door 220, while the front of the cooling chamber 300 is provided with
a cooling chamber door 320. Placed in the upper section in the space defined in the rear
wall of the freezing chamber 200 is a cooling air fan 210 for drawing the cooling air to
the freezing chamber 200 and to the cooling chamber 300. In order to introduce the
cooling air of the fan 210 into the freezing chamber 200, a first cooling air inlet 240 is
provided in the rear wall of the freezing chamber 200 in front of the cooling air fan 210.
Placed under the cooling air fan 210 is an evaporator 230 for absorbing heat of cooling
air, which cooling air was generated through a cooling air generating cycle of the
refrigerator and circulated in the freezing chamber 200 and in the cooling chamber 300. The freezing chamber 200 is insulated from the cooling chamber 300 by both an
upper insulating wall 260 and a lower insulating wall 270. A cooling air return passage
280 is defined between the upper insulating wall 260 and the lower insulating wall 270,
so that the freezing chamber 200, the evaporator 230 and the cooling chamber 300
communicate with each other through the return passage 280. The cooling air return
passage 280 communicates with the freezing chamber 200 through a first cooling air
return port 290, which port 290 sucks the cooling air, after circulating in the freezing
chamber 200, into the passage 280. In the same manner, the cooling air return passage
280 communicates with the cooling chamber 300 through a second cooling air return port
340, which port 340 sucks the cooling air, after circulating in the cooling chamber 300,
into the passage 280. A cooling air passage 250 for introducing the cooling air into the
cooling chamber 300 is provided
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

top surface of said grille (510), said container (512)

removably receiving deodorant cakes (514) therein ;
a guide cover (530) detachably coupled to said grille for
guiding the cooling air to the cooling air return passage

(280) ; and
a fixing plate (540) for fixing said guide cover (530)
to an inner case (600) of the freezing chamber (200) so as

to mount the deodorizing unit (500) in the second cooling air
