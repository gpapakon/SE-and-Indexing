<ABSTRACT>
In an SDH cross connect all switch elements are synchronized to the same multiframe reference clock (AU/TU "master"). According to the invention the synchronizing modules (AU/TU) calculate such pointer information that the time switch (T) on the input side can connect the signals to the space switch (S) so that the incoming signal's phase difference to the reference is observed. The time and space switches do not require a multiframe synchronization, and the incoming signal is not buffered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a synchronization method according to
the preamble of claim 1 in a node of the synchronous digital
hierarchy.The synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) comprises quite a large
entity to be very far advanced in order to transmit time division
signals in the telecommunication network, the backbone network
of which is developing from separate PCM encoded links towards
a remotely controlled cross connect network. The recommendation
CCITT G.707 defines the signals of the first level synchronous
transport module (STM-1) for SDH signals having a transmission
rate of 155.520 Mbit/s. The SDH signals or transport modules are
formed by interleaving the bytes of the subsystem signals. The
frames are combined into multiframes.In the synchronous digital hierarchy each frame contains at its
beginning a synchronization signal for the synchronization of
an the signal, such as an STM-1 signal. The frames are combined
into multiframe signals, and for instance an AU-4 multiframe
signal contains four frames or STM-1 signals. In the cross
connect interface the signals coming from the line are
synchronized with the cross connect clock. The incoming signals
thus have the same frequency and are in synchronism, but at the
cross connect input they still have different phases, whereby
phase differences may occur relating both to a byte and to a
frame. In order to realize the cross-connection the signals must
be further processed in some way.A simple and known idea is to decompose in a demultiplexer the
signals on the incoming lines into signal elements, as is shown
in figure 1. The signal elements are connected through the cross
connect, which in this case could simply be a large space switch,
and then the cross-connected signals are combined by a 
multiplexer to be sent on the outgoing lines.A solution according to prior art is also to delay the incoming
signals with buffers, so that the signals offered to the cross
connect have the same phase. Such a solution entails an
inconvenient construction and requires much components needing
too much space. Due to the speeds and the large frame structures
of the SDH systems the buffering would require a large amount
of memories, which in practice does not appear as a sensible
solution. However, this is the case for example in central
offices, where 2 Mbit/s lines are connected to the cross connect.
A speed like this is low compared to e.g. the SDH speeds, at
which the distances between subracks and racks cause considerable
delays of the transmitted signals. Due to
