<ABSTRACT>
A winding support body (6, 10) for transformers/reactors with a winding of a tape-formed superconductor (8), wherein the support body consists of a substantially straight, circular-cylindrical tubular body which, on the side where the winding is to be placed and out towards the two ends, is provided with a helical slot with a plane surface with a width equal to the width of the tape. In this way, each turn of the slot around the support body forms a surface which practically constitutes the envelope surface of a straight frustum of a cone. The angle (v) between a generatrix (9) of the envelope surface and the axial centre line of the support body increases for each turn out towards the ends of the support body in such a way that the envelope surface at all points coincides with the direction of the magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
One important condition for transformers/reactors to be 
provided with superconducting windings while at the same 
time becoming a commercial and competitive product in 
relation to transformers/reactors with conventional windings 
is that the unavoidable a.c. losses are minimized. In the 
same way as sheet-wound windings are used in conventional 
transformers/reactors, the superconductor can be designed as 
a sheet or a tape to reduce the losses. At the same time, it 
is very important that the orientation of the conductor 
relative to the direction of the magnetic field be chosen 
in an optimal manner. The present invention relates to a 
winding support body with the aid of which the conductor is 
oriented such that the direction of the magnetic field 
coincides with the plane of the conductor. Figure 1 schematically shows the magnetic field configuration 
of two concentric transformer windings around a limb of 
a transformer core, Figure 2 shows how, according to the state of the art, 
conventional sheet-wound transformers are designed to keep 
the losses as low as possible. Figure 3 shows how one end of a winding support body of a 
superconducting transformer winding according to the invention 
can be designed, and Figure 4 shows winding support bodies for the two superconducting 
single-layered windings of the transformer. Characteristic of superconductors is that the current density 
is much higher than in metallic conductors. A superconductor 
which is to be used in a transformer winding/reactor 
winding is suitably given the shape of a tape, 
that is, the width thereof is considerably larger than the 
thickness. The tape preferably consists of a number of 
superconducting filaments embedded into a metallic matrix. 
This, however, means that with such a conductor the 
mechanical strength of the winding is not sufficient to 
support the magnetic forces which may arise. Therefore, the 
conductor needs a mechanical support in the form of a 
winding support body. Since the prior art at present does 
not comprise transformers/reactors with superconductors, 
there is also no prior art regarding the design of winding 
support bodies for such windings. With respect to transformers, the magnetic field configuration 
for two concentric windings 1 and 2 around a limb 3 of 
a transformer core will have an appearance as shown in 
Figure 1. The substantially axial leakage flux 4 extending 
between the windings is deflected in a more or less radial 
direction at the ends of the windings in order to enter the 
co

A winding support body (6, 10) for a winding with conductors in the 
form of a superconducting tape (8), 
characterized
 in that the 
winding support body consists of a substantially straight, 

circular-cylindrical tubular body (6) and that, on the side 
of the body where the winding is to be placed and out 

towards the ends of the body, a helical slot is provided 
along the body with a plane surface with a width equal to 

the width of the tape (8) such that each turn of the slot around 
the body practically forms the envelope surface of a 

straight frustum of a cone and that the angle (v) between a 
generatrix (9) of the envelope surface and the centre axis 

of the body increases for each turn out towards the ends of 
the body in such a way that the envelope surface for each 

turn at all points coincides with the direction of the 
magnetic field which is generated by the winding.
