<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a substantially circular 
tablet dispenser component system which may be adapted for 
a variable day start of a prescribed periodic tablet 
regimen. Also provided are a tablet dispenser kit, a 
tablet package adopted for filling the tablet dispenser 
system, methods of filling the tablet dispenser of the 
invention and methods of administering a prescribed 
regimen of medication using the tablet dispenser system of 
the invention. Medicaments and other pharmaceutical preparations are 
often prescribed for patients on a time related or 
scheduled dispensing basis. Examples of tablets or pills 
that are prescribed in a set periodic regimen include 
tablets or pills adapted for oral ingestion that are used 
for birth control, for regulating blood pressure, for 
regulating blood lipids, as antibiotics and for treating 
a variety of other ailments such as diabetes. Such 
extended time periodic regimens are particularly adaptable 
to preventative medicine (e.g. regulating blood pressure 
or birth control) or for treatment of chronic ailments 
which all require a relatively long course of therapy. The amount of drug provided in a solid form 
pharmaceutical preparation such as a tablet or pill is 
inherently controlled so that each tablet contains a fixed 
amount of dosage so that there is little or no confusion 
as to the amount which should be taken. Variability in 
pharmaceutical administration is often, if not invariably, 
attributable to patient uncertainty, forgetfulness and/or 
confusion as to whether or not a tablet has been taken at  
 
the prescribed rate and time. This problem can be 
compounded when the dosage is to be repeated a number of 
times daily or when multiple medicaments are prescribed or 
when medicaments are to be taken over a long course of 
therapy which may extend from weeks to years. This 
problem may be applicable to most every type of patient 
including the elderly, the chronically ill (who may be in 
a weakened state), and the active person engaged in a long 
term course of treatment such as contraception or hormone 
replacement therapy. As a result of problems of confusion, uncertainty or 
forgetfulness a patient may in reality take more or less 
than the prescribed rate of dosage that is indicated, 
thereby, inadvertently altering the prescribed course of 
treatment. To assure maximum effectiveness of medication 
prescribed it is desirable to provide a dispenser that 
will aid the patient in adhering to the prescribed time 
schedule for dosing whether
