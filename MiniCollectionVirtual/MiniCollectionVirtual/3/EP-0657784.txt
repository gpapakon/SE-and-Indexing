<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive cleaner blade lubricating system for 
electrophotographic printing machines. In an electrophotographic 

printing machine, the amount of residual toner 
available to lubricate a 

cleaner blade is calculated based on the density of the transferred image. A 
band of toner (94) is deposited 

in an inner document gap in selective widths so 
as to provide an adequate amount of toner to 

lubricate the cleaner blade 
(76) across the full width of the photoreceptor (12). 

The lubricating band may be 
variable or may be a constant width with the frequency of placement of the 

band determined based on average image density for a group of 
documents. In the preferred embodiment, the width of the toner band is 

varied as a function of the overall residual toner in each pixel location 
across the width of the photoreceptor based on the density of the images 

transferred. As a result of the varying lubrication bands, the cleaner blade 
is maintained so as to not tuck and cause streaking and/or damage while 

toner efficiency is maximized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a cleaner blade lubrication
system, and more particularly concerns an adaptive system to maintain
cleaner blade lubrication while minimizing toner waste in an
electrophotographic printing machine. Further, it relates to a
method of adaptive cleaner blade lubrication.In a typical electrophotographic printing process, a
photoconductive member is charged to a substantially uniform potential so
as to sensitize the surface thereof. The charged portion of the
photoconductive member is exposed to a light image of an original
document being reproduced. Exposure of the charged photoconductive
member selectively dissipates the charges thereon in the irradiated areas.
This records an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive member
corresponding to the informational areas contained within the original
document. After the electrostatic latent image is recorded on the
photoconductive member, the latent image is developed by bringing a
developer material into contact therewith. Generally, the developer
material comprises toner particles adhering triboelectrically to carrier
granules. The toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules to the
latent image forming a toner powder image on the photoconductive
member. The toner powder image is then transferred from the
photoconductive member to a copy sheet. The toner particles are heated
to permanently affix the powder image to the copy sheet. After each
transfer process, the toner remaining on the photoconductor is cleaned by
a cleaning device.One type of cleaning device utilized is a urethane blade which is
configured in either a wiper or doctor mode to remove residual toner and
other particles. In some instances a disturber brush is used in combination
with the blade to remove paper debris and to disturb the residual toner
image. It is known that the residual toner acts as a lubricant for the cleaner
blade and helps to minimize blade tuck which can lead to streaking of the 
image at the very least or can cause blade and/or photoreceptor damage.
One way of assuring proper blade lubrication is to place a toner swath
across a photoreceptor at some known interval to assure blade lubrication.It is desirable to be able to lubricate the blade with a minimum
of extra toner and to fully utilize any residual toner to lubricate the cleaner
blade. It is also desirable to provide a substantially uniform lubrication to
the cleaning blade across its width.The following disclosures may be relevant to various aspects of
the present

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for adaptive cleaner blade lubrication
comprising:


a photoreceptive member (12);
a cleaner blade (76) to clean toner remaining on the

photoreceptive member after image transfer to a
recording sheet (48);
an image density sensor, said image density sensor
determining the density of an image to be transferred to

a recording sheet and generating a signal indicative
thereof;
a controller, responsive to the signal from the said
image density sensor, said controller being adapted to

determine the amount of toner required to properly
lubricate the cleaner blade; and
means (38) for depositing a quantity of toner on said
photoreceptive member in a direction transverse to a

process direction so as to provide cleaner blade
lubrication.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
depositing means varies a width of a toner band so as

to provide more toner for lubrication purposes in one
section of said photoreceptive member than in other

sections. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
depositing means varies the frequency of depositing the

toner on said photoreceptive member in response to said
controller blade lubricating determination.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said image
density sensor comprises a raster input scanner which

determines the image on a pixel by pixel basis and emits
a signal indicative thereof to said controller.
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said
controller determines the area coverage over a distance

in the process direction along the photoreceptor for a
discrete pixel location in a direction normal to the

process direction of the said photoreceptive member so
as to determine the available toner for cleaner blade

lubrication.
A method of adaptive cleaner blade lubrication
comprising the steps of:


calculating the density of an image to be transferred to
a recording sheet; and
depositing a selective width toner band in a direction
transverse to a process direction of movement of a

photoreceptive member to thereby lubricate a cleaner
blade (76) to clean toner remaining on the

photoreceptive member after image transfer to a
recording sheet (48).
The method as described in claim 6, wherein said
calculating step comprises:


determining for each pixel in a scan direction normal to
the process direction of movement of the photoreceptor

member whether it is a black or a white pixel; 
averaging the number of pixels that are developed for
each discrete pixel location over a selected distance in

the process direction; and
generating a signal to control the depositing of the
selective width toner band as a function of the

determined image density.
