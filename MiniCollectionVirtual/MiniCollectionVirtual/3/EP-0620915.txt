<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the determination of a chemical or biochemical species comprises a resonant optical biosensor (1-4) disposed in a light path between a pivotally-mounted source (5) of monochromatic light and a stationary detector (12) adapted to monitor some characteristic of the light. There is provided means (7) for causing pivotal motion of the light source (5) so as to vary the angle of incidence of the light on the sensor (1-4). Also provided is means for monitoring the instantaneous angle of incidence. The means for varying the angle of incidence of the light on the sensor may be a cam arrangement (7) acting on a pivoting member (6) carrying the light source (5), and the means for monitoring the instantaneous angle of incidence of the light on the sensor (1-4) may comprise means for monitoring the number of steps performed by a stepper motor driving the cam arrangement (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sensors, especially those termed
biosensors, ie devices for the analysis of biologically active
species such as antigens and antibodies in samples of
biological origin. In particular, the invention relates to
biosensors based on resonant optical phenomena, eg surface
plasmon resonance or resonant attenuated or frustrated total
internal reflection.Many devices for the automatic determination of biochemical
analytes in solution have been proposed in recent years.
Typically, such devices (biosensors) include a sensitised
coating layer which is located in the evanescent region of a
resonant field. Detection of the analyte typically utilizes
optical techniques such as, for example, surface plasmon
resonance (SPR), and is based on changes in the thickness
and/or refractive index of the coating layer resulting from
interaction of that layer with the analyte. This causes a
change, eg in the angular position of the resonance.Other optical biosensors include a waveguide in which a beam
of light is propagated. The optical characteristics of the
device are influenced by changes occurring at the surface of
the waveguide. One form of optical biosensor is based on
frustrated total reflection. The principles of frustrated
total reflection (FTR) are well-known; the technique is
described, for example, by Bosacchi and Oehrle [Applied Optics
(1982), 21, 2167-2173]. An FTR device for use in immunoassay
is disclosed in European Patent Application No 2205236A and
comprises a cavity layer bounded on one side by the sample
under investigation and on the other side by a spacer layer
which in turn is mounted on a substrate. The substrate-spacer
layer interface is irradiated with monochromatic radiation
such that total reflection occurs, the associated evanescent
field penetrating through the spacer layer. If the thickness
of the spacer layer is correct and the incident parallel wave 
vector matches one of the resonant mode propagation constants,
the total reflection is frustrated and radiation is coupled
into the cavity layer. The cavity layer must be composed of
material which has a higher refractive index than the spacer
layer and which is transparent at the wavelength of the
incident radiation.In devices of this kind, the position of resonance is
monitored by varying the angle at which light is incident on
the sensor. The scanning of angle may be performed either
sequentially or simultaneously ie by varying the angle of
incidence of a parallel beam of light or by simultaneously
irradiating over a
