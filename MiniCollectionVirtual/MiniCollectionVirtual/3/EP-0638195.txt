<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for assisting the learning of a foreign language employs a text in the foreign language printed with an ink which reflects part of the visual spectrum, such as red ink. Superimposed on that foreign language text is a literal translation of the text in a language familiar to the reader, imprinted in an ink which reflects a different portion of the visual spectrum, such as blue ink. A student (14) reads the text (16) using eyeglasses (12) which have lens (18) coated with filters to that the upper portions (20), through which the student normally reads the text, pass light reflected from the foreign language text, rendering it visible to the reader, and block light reflected from the familiar language translation, rendering it invisible to the reader. When the reader requires translation of a section of the foreign language text, the reader's gaze is shifted, in the manner of use of bi-focal glasses (12), to observe the text through the lower sections (22) of the filter, rendering the translation visible.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TEACHING AID FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGE&Field of the Invention*This invention relates to apparatus useful in the teaching of a foreign language comprising a media imprinted 5 with both a foreign language text and a familiar language translation of that text positioned closely to one another, and filter means to render either the text or its translation visible to a reader.Background cf the Invention10 A simple and effective method for learning a foreign language is to read entertaining literature in that language. However, the need to constantly refer to a dictionary often makes what should be an enjoyable experience tedious, thus discouraging the reader.15 One solution to this problem involves printing the foreign language text and its familiar language translation on opposing pages of a book so that quick reference may be had to the translation. This has been implemented in prayer books and the like but the relatively20 extensive eye movement required to refer to the translation â– A interrupts the reading of the foreign language text* sufficiently to destroy the flow of the reading process.Alternatively, it has been proposed to print the familiar language translation and a foreign language text25 directly adjacent to one another, effectively interleafing lines of the foreign and the familiar text. U.S. Patent 

3,126,647 discloses this type of arrangement in which the familiar text is printed in such small size type as to be unreadable to the normal unaided eye. When the familiar language translation of a word in the foreign text is required, a hand magnifying glass is brought into position over the translation, rendering it visible. Similarly, U.S. Patent 4,891,011 discloses a system in which a familiar language translation is printed directly beneath the foreign language text using a medium which is generally invisible to the human eye unless exposed to light of a specified frequency range, such as ultraviolet light. The reader is provided with a portable light source of the specified frequency which may be used to illuminate the translation when required. These arrangements require that the lines of the foreign text be spaced relatively widely from one another, and require the reader to move the device which will reveal the foreign language into position over the text.Swiss Patent 363010 suggests overprinting the familiar and foreign texts using inks of different colors and employing a sheet of the same size as the book incorporating a series of two-color filters which may be positioned over the text so

 CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for assisting the learning of foreign language to a reader having fluency in a familiar language, comprising: a media imprinted with a plurality of lines of text in the foreign language with ink of a first color, and a. plurality of lines of text constituting a translation of the foreign text in the familiar language imprinted on the media with each line of the familiar language translation associated with an equivalent line in the foreign text; and eyeglasses adapted to be worn by the reader incorporating lenses having a pair of sections, a first adapted to pass electro-magnetic radiation reflected from the ink in.which the foreign language is imprinted and to block radiation reflected from the ink in which the familiar language is imprinted and a second adapted to pass radiation reflected from the ink in which the familiar language is imprinted, whereby the user may shift his gaze relative to the media so as to view either the foreign language text or the familiar language text.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 in which the eyeglasses have lens with the first sections forming the upper portion of each lens and the second section forming the lower portion of each lens. 


 3. Apparatus for assisting the learning of foreign language to a reader having fluency in a familiar language, comprising: a media imprinted with a plurality of lines of text in the foreign language with ink of a first color, and a plurality of lines of text constituting a translation of the foreign text in the familiar language imprinted on the media with each line of the familiar language translation associated with an equivalent line in the foreign text; and filter means for reading either the foreign or familiar text comprising a transparent bookmark having a length at least equal to the length of the imprinted text lines and having a width allowing it to be placed over a single line of text at a time, the filter having an upper section extending the full length of the filter tinted so as to pass light from a first of the imprinted texts and block light from the second, and lower section tinted so as to pass light from the second text and block light from the first.
