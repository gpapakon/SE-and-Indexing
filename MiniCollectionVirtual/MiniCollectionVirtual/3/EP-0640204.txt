<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is that of telescoped-round type ammunition. The ammunition according to the invention comprises a case consisting of a cylindrical envelope (2) carrying at each end a cap (3a, 3b), and within which are disposed a projectile (8) and a propellant charge. Means are also provided for axially holding in place the projectile in relation to the envelope, said means consisting of a cover (16) which is integral with the front part of the projectile (3) and carries an annular flange (19) made integral with the front cap (3a) with the aid of securing means. Application in weapons.

A telescoped type munition (1) comprising a case,
formed of a cylindrical casing (2) having a plug (3a, 3b)

at each end, inside which are positioned a projectile (8)
and a propellant charge, a munition incorporating means to

ensure the axial hold of the projectile with respect to
the casing, a munition 
characterized in that
 the axial
holding means are solely constituted by a cap (16)

incorporating a cylindrical central part (17) integral
with a front part of the projectile (8) and carrying a

ring-shaped collar (19), made integral with the front plug
(3a) by fastening means, and which is symmetrical with

respect to the munition axis.
A munition according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the ring-shaped collar (19) closes the front of the

casing (2).
A munition according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the fastening means are formed by

welding the collar (19) onto the front plug (3a).
A munition according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the front plug (3a) carries a

metallic reinforcement ring (4a) and the fastening means
are formed by pinching the collar (19) between the ring

(4a) and the front plug (3a).
A munition according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the cylindrical central part (17) of

the cap (16) carries axial slots (30), evenly spaced
angularly, as well as teeth (31) arranged at one end and

intended to fit into a groove (32) on the projectile so as
to make the projectile integral with the cap.
A munition according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the ring-shaped collar (19) carries

a ring-shaped incipient fracture (20, 34).
A munition according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the incipient fracture is a circular thinning (34) of 

the collar (19) whose diametre is substantially equal to
that of the cylindrical central part (17) of the cap (16).
A munition according to one of Claims 3 to 7,
characterized in that the projectile incorporates a sub;

calibered penetrator (9) placed in a bore (10) arranged in
a calibered sabot (11), and in that the cap (16) is made

integral with a front part of the sabot (11) at the bore
(10).
A munition according to one of Claims 3 to 7,
characterized in that the projectile has a nose cone (22)

at its front part on which a nose (21) having a
cylindrical external profile (27) is fastened enabling it

to be fitted into the front ring (3a), the nose also
comprises a bore (23) by which the cap (16) is made

integral with it.
