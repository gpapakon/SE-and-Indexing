<ABSTRACT>
According to a first aspect of the invention, a power control switch comprises two solid 
state switching elements (14, 15) in parallel, the second switching element (15) having 

a higher resistance but faster turn-off time than the first element. In operation the switch 
is pulse width modulated and the first element is switched off after the second element 

to establish a guard period, the duration of which is controlled in dependence upon the 
duty cycle to provide efficient switching. According to a second aspect of the invention 

a power control switch comprises a switching element (14 or 15) controlled by a field 
programmable gate array (5) which is preferably programmed by an erasable 

programmable read only memory (EPROM), thereby providing a reconfigurable control 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power control switch of the type employing a solid state 
switching element. Power switches for DC applications commonly use pulse width modulation. In its 
simplest form this comprises the power switch being driven at a particular frequency, 
with the switching element switched to an "on" position for a certain proportion of each 
cycle, the duty cycle, in which the energy transmitted depends on the proportion of the 
cycle for which the switching element is in the "on" position. Pulse width modulation 
is commonly achieved by using a comparator to compare a sawtooth waveform with a 
reference voltage and applying the comparator output via buffering to the base of a 
bipolar transistor. The duty cycle can be increased or decreased by varying the reference 
voltage such that the proportion of each cycle for which the reference voltage is 
exceeded is correspondingly increased or decreased. In certain power switching applications it is important that the switch be efficient for one 
of two reasons. The first reason is that if the switch is inefficient then considerable heat 
is generated within the switch, which reduces the power handling capability of the 
switching element and/or requires heat sinking for the switching element and consequent 
heat exchanging apparatus, which can substantially dictate the size of the switch. 
Secondly, in some DC applications the power is supplied by a finite source, namely a  
 
battery, and therefore it is particularly important that the energy stored in that battery is 
used efficiently, especially in such applications as electric vehicles where the battery size 
itself is limited. Therefore there is a requirement for a highly efficient power control 
switch. The recent development of the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) overcomes the 
inefficiency associated with the large drive current required for conventional bipolar 
transistors. However, another power loss associated with bipolar transistors, both 
conventional and IGBTs, in pulse width modulated applications, is that which arises due 
to the relatively slow turn-off time of typically 500 ns or more. During this period the 
voltage across the switching element increases while current continues to pass, especially 
if there is a high inductance in the circuit, as there would be if the load was, for 
example, an electric motor. The power dissipated in the transistor is the product of its 
voltage and current. It will be readily appreciated that the efficiency of the bipolar 
tra
