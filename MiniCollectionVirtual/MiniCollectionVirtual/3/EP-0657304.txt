<ABSTRACT>
The binding machine (1) using the tape employs the 
binding tape (6) having the bonding tape (7) coated on its rear 

surface with the adhesive and consists of the boring mechanism 
(2) for boring the aperture (
h
) through the papers (P) to be 
bound and the binding mechanism (3) which winds the bonding tape 

(7) around or halfway around the portion between the bored 
aperture (
h
) and the end surface (p₁) of the papers (P) and so 
on to be bound and bonds the bonding tape (7) thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for
binding papers, a bag opening and so on and particularly to a
binding machine using a tape, which bores an aperture through a
bundle of papers and so on and binds the papers and so on with a
tape by piercing the tape made of a paper, for example, through
the aperture, and a binding tape.
Related Art:An existing binding machine is such that a Hotchkiss
type stapling machine using a staple cartridge binds the papers
by driving a metal staple into a bundle of the papers to an
extent that needles of the staple are pierced therethrough and
then projected from a rear surface of the papers and by bending
finward the needles of the staple projected from the rear
surface of the papers.The binding machine using the staple (a stapling
machine) according to this method is sometimes encountered by
disadvantages such that the staple is stuck into a finger by
mistake when the papers are bound and that the needles of the
staple catch a cloth and injure a skin if they are not
satisfactorily bent but projectingly kept. When the papers
which are already bound are to be released because the papers
are not satisfactorily bound or become unnecessary, an equipment
such as a remover for removing the staple is necessary. Without
such remover, it is attempted to remove the staple with a 
fingernail. However, there is then the risk such that the
fingernail is injured and, moreover, clacks if the staple is
thick.When the unnecessary papers are fed into a paper
cutting machine such as a shredder or the like, it is necessary
to remove the staple from the bound papers. If the papers bound
by the staple are fed into the paper cutting machine by mistake,
there is then the disadvantage such that the staple is caught by
the paper cutting machine, which causes trouble in operation
thereof and further damages a blade portion of the paper cutting
machine to lead to reduction of life of the cutting machine. An
envelop is sometimes stapled and sealed by the stapling machine.
When a letter opener is used to open such envelop, the stapled
envelop sometimes causes trouble. Therefore, in consideration
of inconvenience in opening the envelop, it is not recommended
to staple the envelop to seal it.On the other hand, when many bundles of the papers
bounded by the metal staples are housed and piled, only an upper
left stapled portion, for example, of a pile of the papers
becomes extraordinarily thick because one bundle of papers
becomes thick only at a stapled portion and hence the whole
papers to be

<CLAIMS>
A binding machine (1) for binding together a plurality
of sheets of paper (P) comprising:


a binding tape (6);
a boring mechanism (2); and
a binding mechanism (3); characterised in that

   said boring mechanism (2) comprises a blade body (16)
for boring an aperture through a plurality of sheets of

paper, said blade body (16) having a tape insertion aperture
(16b) bored through the centre portion thereof for receiving

said binding tape (6) and drawing said binding tape through
the said paper aperture as the blade body (16) moves through

the said paper aperture.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the boring mechanism (2) further comprises a pressing member

(15) for supporting said blade body (16) and a spring member
(19a) for returning said pressing member upward.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim
2, wherein said blade body (16) of said boring mechanism (2)

has a blade edge (16a) which, in use, is sharply curved
downward at its centre or a concave blade edge (16a) which,

in use, is curved upward at its centre.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim
2, wherein said blade body (16) of said boring mechanism (2)

has a circular type or box type boring blade.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 4, wherein said binding mechanism (3) further comprises

a peeling unit (27,33,34,35a,35b) for peeling a bonding tape
(7) with a predetermined length of said binding tape (6) 

from an auxiliary tape (8), a first pressing body (17) for
pressing and bonding a head end of said bonding tape (7) to

a front surface of said sheets of paper (P), a rotating
second pressing body (22) for pressing and bonding a tail

end of said bonding tape (7) to a rear surface of said
sheets of paper (P), a movable gripping body (40) for

gripping the papers to be bound and for slidably inserting
the said sheets of paper into said boring mechanism (2), and

a projection portion (44) provided on a rear portion of said
movable gripping body (40) for engaging with a forwarding

aperture (10) of the binding tape (6) in a ganged relation
with movement of the movable gripping body and for

forwarding the binding tape.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in Claim 5, wherein
said movable gripping body (40) of the binding mechanism (3)

has two rectangular boards (41,42) which are engaged at
respective sides thereof in a hinge fashion so as to freely

grip papers, and apertures at respective centres of the
rectangular boards (41,42) to pass said bonding tape (7)

therethrough.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, further comprising threading means for

threading the said paper aperture with said bonding tape (7)
by inserting said bonding tape into the tape insertion

aperture (16b) of the blade body (16) before the said paper
aperture is bored through the said sheets of paper, whereby

the bonding tape (7) is passed through the said paper
aperture at the same time as when the said paper aperture is

bored.
The binding machine (1) as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 6, further comprising threading means for threading the

said paper aperture with said bonding tape (7) by inserting
