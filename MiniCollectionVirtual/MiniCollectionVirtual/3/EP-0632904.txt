<ABSTRACT>
The device is primarily an anti-theft device or alarm for use in a vehicle and which can operate in a plurality of modes. The first mode may involve transmission of signals in the form of ultrasonic pulses from a transmitter (15) which are reflected from surfaces in the driver/passenger space (11) of the vehicle. The pulses are picked up by a receiver (16) and a pattern of reflections (34) is formed for comparison with a reference (33) based on the current level of background noise and environmental conditions in the space (11) and those associated with types of disturbance not intended to trigger an alarm. If an intrusion or disturbance occurs in the space which does not provide certainty that an alarm should be given, the device switches to a second mode where the transmitter (15) can transmit a continuous ultrasonic signal or a burst of ultrasound for a relatively long period. The reflected signal is picked up by the receiver (16) and compared to a reference level based on the current level of background noise and environmental conditions in the space (11) and those associated with types of disturbance not intended to trigger an alarm. If the reference level is exceeded an alarm is triggered. A third mode can be provided where there is no continuous or burst transmission from the transmitter and the system becomes passive so that the receiver (16) can pick up noise of breaking glass (Fig. 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for and method of
surveillance of a space and is particularly, but not
exclusively, concerned with an anti-theft device for a
motor vehicle.In particular, the invention is concerned with a device
which makes use of a transmitter for transmitting a
signal into a space to be monitored, the signal being
reflected from the space and picked up by a receiver.
The reflected signal is then processed to provide a
reference. Where there is an intrusion into the space,
the subsequent reflected signal will deviate from the
reference and provided that there is a significant
difference between the two signals the device will
provide an appropriate indication such as an audible
and/or visible alarm or electrical signal. Insignificant
differences such as would be created, for example, by
environmental changes will not normally be sufficient to
trigger the indication.In one type of prior system the signal is transmitted as
a series of pulses which has a fairly low power
consumption and enables moving objects to be detected.
However, with such a system coverage is restricted to a
defined area, it does not perform well where the space is
defined by or includes highly absorbent interiors, the 
position of the transmitter and receiver is fairly critical for efficient
operation, storing means for the reference requires a large amount of
memory and it does not easily sense smaller and faster moving objects if
environmental noise is significant. In another prior system, the signal is
transmitted continuously and sets up a wave pattern in the space. With
such a system there is a relatively greater coverage area, it is less sensitive
to the nature of the space itself and its contents and can provide reliable
sensing of fast moving objects. However the continuous transmission
consumes more energy than intermittent pulses.With prior art systems of either type, there are borderline areas where
the system cannot differentiate between an intrusion which should trigger
an alarm and a change which could be due to environmental variations.
Increasing the sensitivity of the device can cause the device to be triggered
by a change in temperature in the space, small moving objects such as flies
and external noise. On the other hand, decreasing the sensitivity of the
device renders the device incapable of sensing, say the breaking of a window
or the arm of an intruder reaching into the vehicle and stealing a small
article.EP-A-0473835 discloses a surveillance method having two detection
modes, namely
