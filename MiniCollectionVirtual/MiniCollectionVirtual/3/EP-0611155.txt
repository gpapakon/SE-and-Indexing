<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing device for detecting 
the servo pattern pre-recorded at a pre-set interval on a 

disc-shaped recording medium, and for generating channel 
clocks, that is, clock signals for sampling data used 

during recording or reproduction on the basis of the 
detected information on the servo pattern, is disclosed. 

For providing the correctly phased channel clocks, a 

voltage controlled oscillator employed in the phase-locked 
loop of a channel clock forming unit of the recording 

and/or reproducing device for generating the channel clocks 
is controlled not only by phase error data but also by 

positive phase error data and negative phase error data for 
enlarging the locking range for enabling correct phase 

locking. Besides, for providing correctly phased channel 
clocks for the disc-shaped recording medium of the constant 

angular velocity (CAV) system, the pickup position on the 
recording medium is detected so that the phase error 

detection data is corrected on the basis of the detected 
pickup position for providing the channel clocks phased in 

correspondence with the recording/replay position on the 
recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or
reproducing device for detecting the servo pattern
pre-recorded at a pre-set interval on a disc-shaped
recording medium, such as an optical disc, magneto-optical
disc or a magnetic disc, and for generating channel clocks
based on the detected information on the servo patterns.There has hitherto been known an optical disc of the
sample servo system as shown in JP Patent KOKAI (Laid-Open)
Publication No.3-156774 (1991). The preamble of claim 1 is based on this document.With the sampled servo system optical disc device,
the channel clocks, which are clock signals for sampling
data used during recording or reproduction, need to be
phased correctly.Fig.1 shows an arrangement of a clock detection
system for the optical disc as applied to a reproducing
device for a magneto-optical disc.The magneto-optical disc employed with the
reproducing device shown in Fig.1 is explained by referring
to Fig.2. The magneto-optical disc includes a number of
servo areas each having recorded therein servo patterns
each consisting of a pair of wobble pits 200 and a clock
pit 201. Each pair of the wobble pits is offset towards the
inner and outer peripheries from the center 
of a concentric track TR and the associated clock pit is formed
on the center of the track TR intermediate between the wobble
pits.960 of the servo areas, for example, are formed for each
circular turn of the track, with an area defined between a given
servo area to the next servo area being a data area. Recording
data modulated in a pre-set manner are photomagnetically recorded
in the data area along with synchronization data, address data
and the like.Referring to Fig.1, before proceeding to reproduction of
recording data recorded on the magneto-optical disc, a servo
pattern detection mode is set, in which the reproducing device
for the magneto-optical disc causes the magneto-optical disc to
be run in rotation by a spindle motor 100 for phase-matching the
servo pattern detection data with the channel clocks.During the servo pattern detection mode, the optical system
102 causes a laser beam to be radiated on the magneto-optical
disc 101 to detect the return light beam. The recording data and
the servo patterns recorded on the magneto-optical disc 101 are
reproduced by photo-electric conversion of the return light beam
for generating playback signals which are supplied to an
amplifier 105.The amplifier 105 amplifies the playback signals with a preset
gain to supply the amplified playback signals to an A/D
converter
