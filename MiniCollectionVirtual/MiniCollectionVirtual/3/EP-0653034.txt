<ABSTRACT>
A locked seal with an axially compressed gasket (8), includes a mating seal flange (9) for axially compressing the gasket (8), and a mating lock flange (12) for urging the locking ring (18) against the flat end (1), said ring (18) being provided with an elastomeric front portion (25) for engaging the back of the mating seal flange (9). The joint may be used in a pipe made of ductile cast iron.

<CLAIMS>
Locked joint between the plain end (1) of a first 
tubular element and the sleeve (2) of a second tubular 

element, comprising an axial-compression sealing gasket 
(8), a locking ring (18) with internal teeth (21) 

surrounding the plain end, and a clamping device (9, 12) 
provided with means (10, 34, 34A, 34B) for fastening with 

respect to the sleeve and suitable for providing the 
axial compression of the gasket (8) and the anti-recoil 

retention of the locking ring, this clamping device 
comprising two mating flanges, namely a sealing mating 

flange (9) suitable for axially compressing the gasket 
(8), and a locking mating flange (12) suitable for 

tightening the locking ring (18) onto the plain end (1), 
characterized in that the locking ring (18) is provided 

with an elastomeric front appendage (25) intended to bear 
on the rear face of the sealing mating flange (9). 
Locked joint according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the sealing mating flange (9) includes members 

(10) for fastening axially onto the sleeve (2), whereas 
the locking mating flange (12) includes members (34) for 

fastening axially onto the sealing mating flange (9). 
Locked joint according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the mating flanges (9, 12) include independent 

means (10, 34A, 34B) for fastening axially onto the 
sleeve (2). 
Locked joint according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the fastening means (10, 34A, 34B) of each mating 

flange (9, 12) pass freely through the other mating 
flange. 
Locked joint according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized  
 

in that all the fastening members (10, 34A, 34B) 
are positioned radially, on the sleeve (2) side, by a 

peripheral rim (16) of the sealing mating flange (9). 
Locked joint according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the fastening members (10, 34A, 34B) of 

each mating flange (9, 12) are positioned radially, on 
the sleeve (2) side, by a sector of peripheral rim (16A, 

16B) secured to this mating flange. 
Locked joint according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that spacing means are provided to 

ensure a minimum spacing (d) between the two mating 
flanges (9, 12) when the joint is assembled. 
Locked joint according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the said spacing means comprise a limitation of 

the screwing length of threaded members (34, 34A, 34B) 
for fastening the locking mating flange (12).
