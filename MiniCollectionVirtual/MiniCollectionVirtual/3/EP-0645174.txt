<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the removal of 
components causing turbidity, from a fluid, by means of microfiltration, 

whereby the fluid is beer, wine, fruit juice, bacterial 
suspension, blood, milk, enzyme suspension, etc. 
According to the invention the fluid to be treated is 
fed across an asymmetric membrane having a pore structure such 

that the pores on the feed side of the membrane are larger 
than the nominal pore size and the pores of nominal pore size 

occur in the cross section toward the permeate side, the filtered 
off components are back-flushed from the membrane and 

are subsequently carried away with the fluid. The nominal pore 
size is usually 0.1-5.0 µm and preferably 0.2-1.0 µm. The membrane 

may be tubular, flat or capillary. Back-flushing takes 
place intermittently with a frequency of 1 second to 10 

minutes for 0.1-1 second at a counter pressure of 0.5-5 bar. 
The feed velocity is preferably below 2 m/s and the pressure 

difference over the membrane is less than 0.5 bar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
removal of components that cause turbidity, from a liquid, by
means of microfiltration.The application of microfiltration whereby by
maintaining a flow along the membrane wall, it is attempted to
prevent accumulation of dirt, is a known technique. This technique
is generally called crossflow microfiltration.In practice this technique is applied in, for instance,
ultrafiltration and microfiltration.Effective velocities to prevent the build-up of a
fouling layer often begin at 2 m/s while as a rule velocities
from 4-6 m/s are used.Dependent on the membrane configuration this is the
range where turbulence in the flow occurs.It should be noted that the technique of back-flushing
membranes was introduced by Klein and Schneider for self-supporting
capillary membranes (Desalination 41 (1982 263-275)
whereby microfiltration membranes were applied with a pore
size of above 0.01 µm. For further prior art reference is made
to "Microfiltration mit Membranen" by S. Ripperger (ISBN 3-527-28457-5,
1992).In the above-mentioned known techniques the back-flush
is performed once every few minutes, giving a loss of
production because part of the permeate is pushed back to the
concentrate side of the membrane.A special technique is used
by Memtec, who back-flush the membrane with gas (AU-B-34.400/84).The fastest back-flush intervals are recorded in DK-A-476/90
(APV Pasilac).
Here back-flush frequencies are recorded of 1-10
back-flushes per minute at a back-flush duration of 1-5
seconds. One thing and another results in the fact, that due
to these relative long back-flushing times the installation may
not be in use for filtration for 10-20% of the time.DE-C-4105210 discloses crossflow microfiltration with periodic
backwashing. The larger pores of the asymmetric membrane used are
oriented towards the feed side. The shortest backwash mentioned lasts
"a few tenths of a second". A disadvantage of the known membrane is that it suffers
a productivity drop due to the formation of a so-called
secondary membrane, consisting of a packing of particles to be 
filtered off, which partly plug the pores and as layer shows
only a limited "own" permeability.The object of the invention is to provide a method
with practically no productivity drop because the thickness of
the layer of particles to be filtered off is limited and the
secondary membrane is disturbed.To this end the present invention provides a method
for the removal of components causing turbidity from a liquid,
by means of
