<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a prosthesis for controlling urinary incontinence in women by correcting the vesicourethral angle with a fluid-filled or fluid-fillable, height-adjustable elevation chamber (1) which can be inserted as an adjustable spacer between the vagina and the start of the urethra and whose upper outer surface (7) is designed as a non-constricting support surface for the urethra (9) and whose lower outer surface (8) is designed as a support surface for placing on the upper side of the vagina, and whose distance-determining height can be adjusted in the implanted state by puncturing and correction of the fluid amount. According to the invention, the prosthesis has at least two flexible bands (2, 3) arranged on the elevation chamber (1) for loose fixation of its position in the body.
