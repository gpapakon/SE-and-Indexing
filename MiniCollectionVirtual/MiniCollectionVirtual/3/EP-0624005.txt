<ABSTRACT>
To produce a balanced broadband blocking filter for low-voltage networks which are used for carrier frequency information transmission, a triple-chain filter structure is proposed. In the filter, a series coil (L1), which bridges a series circuit comprising three resistors (R1 to R3), is disposed between the input and output. A bypass coil (L2, L3) is in each case connected to the connecting points between two resistors (R1 and R2 or R2 and R3). The outputs of the bypass coils (L2, L3) are connected to one another and to a bypass capacitor (C).

High-frequency rejection filter for arrangement 
in a low-voltage power supply which is used for carrier-frequency 

message transmission, characterized in that the 
filter is constructed as a broadband filter with downstream 

bridged triple chain structure: 

a) a longitudinal coil (L1) is arranged between a first 
filter input (E1) and a first filter output (A1) and is 

bridged by a series circuit formed by three resistors 
(R1, R2, R3), 
b) a first bypass coil (L2) is connected to the junction 
point between the first resistor (R1) and the second 

resistor (R2), and a second bypass coil (L3) is connected 
to the junction point between the second resistor (R2) 

and the third resistor (R3), 
c) the outputs of the two bypass coils (L2, L3) are 
connected to one another and to the input of a bypass 

capacitor (C), the output of which is connected to the 
base line between the second input (E2) and the second 

output (A2) of the filter. 
High-frequency rejection filter according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that at least one of the 

resistors (R1 to R3) is designed to be variable. 
High-frequency rejection filter according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that solely the second resistor 

(R2) is designed to be variable. 
High-frequency rejection filter according to one 
of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

inductance of the two bypass coils (L2, L3) is identical 
and in that the inductance of the longitudinal coil (L1)  

 
is twelve times as large as the inductance of one of the 

bypass coils (L2 or L3). 
High-frequency rejection filter according to one 
of the preceding claims, modified in that a series 

resonant circuit is employed instead of just a bypass 
capacitor (C), which series resonant circuit comprises a 

series circuit formed by a capacitor (C) and a series 
resonant coil (L4).
