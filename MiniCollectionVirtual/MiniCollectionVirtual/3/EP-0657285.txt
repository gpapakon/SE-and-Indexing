<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing plate feed control for printing plates conveyed on the sheet path in printing machines. Setting out from the object of providing a printing plate feed control for printing machines having printing plates supplied via the sheet path and an intermediate cylinder, the printing plates to be delivered or supplied are conveyed virtually simultaneously on all transfer routes and the end of the drawing-in of the flexible printing plates and the setting-down of the last printing plate to be delivered occur virtually simultaneously in a printing plate feed control for automatically mounting and/or demounting flexible printing plates on/from at least one printing forme cylinder, provided with a printing plate gripper system, of a printing machine, comprising at least two printing units, via the sheet path and transfer routes by sheet conveying means, present on the printing machine and containing sheet-conveying cylinders fitted with gripper systems, and an intermediate cylinder provided with an auxiliary gripper system.

<CLAIMS>
Printing plate feed logistics for the automatic introduction and extraction of flexible printing 
plates (4) on to / from at least one print forme cylinder (8), fitted with a printing plate gripper 

system (9) of a printing press with at least two print units (DW 1: DWn) via sheet route (16) 
and transfer sections (19) by means of the sheet feeding device available in the printing press, 

consisting of the sheet feed cylinder (13;14), fitted with gripper systems (5), and with an 
intermediate cylinder (6) fitted with an auxiliary gripper system (7), characterised in this way, 

that the plates to be extracted, and therefore the flexible printing plates (4) to be introduced 
are advanced virtually simultaneously on all transfer sections (19), and that the introduction of 

the flexible printing plates ends virtually simultaneously to the stacking of the last flexible 
plate to be extracted. 
Printing plate feed logistics according to the claim 1, is hereby characterised, that the flexible 
printing plate (4) to be advanced to the last print unit (DWn) on sheet route (16) sets off 

before the flexible printing plates (4) for the other print units (DW 3; DW;2 DW 1). 
Printing plate feed logistics according to claim 1 and 2, is hereby characterised, that the 
flexible printing plates starting after the first flexible printing plate, start at intervals equal in 

length to that of the printing plate switches sheet feed transfer section (20) between the print 
units, and virtually simultaneously, therefore within the length of one cycle reach the print 

unit switches sheet route/transfer route (20). 
Printing plate feed logistics according to claim 2, is hereby characterised, that the length of 
the cycle corresponds to one revolution of a single revolution shaft. 
Printing plate feed logistics according to claim 1, is hereby characterised, that the flexible 
printing plates (4) traverse the transfer section (19) at a transfer velocity of VT and the sheet 

route (16) at a sheet velocity of VB.  
 
Printing plate feed logistics according to claim 1, is hereby characterised, that the earliest 
starting point
 
TStart N of the first flexible printing plate (4) advanced, is determined by the equation 


TStart N 
>
 (TTA +1) - T1 X TStartA 
Print plate feed logistics according to claim 1, is hereby characterised, that the latest starting 
point Tstart of the first flexible printing plate to be advanced is determined by the equation, 


TStart = (TE -T1 + TTA) - (TN + TTE)
