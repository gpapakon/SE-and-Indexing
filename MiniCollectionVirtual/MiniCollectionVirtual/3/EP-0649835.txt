<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel N-substituted-3-halopropiolamide 
compound, a method of 
producing the same compound, and a composition for 
controlling noxious organisms containing the same 
compound. It has been reported by Yamazoe et al. that 
certain propiolic acid derivatives and propiolamide 
derivatives exhibit antifungal activity [Japanese J. 
Pharmacology, Vol. 102, page 278 (1982)]. N-(substituted 
phenyl)propiolamide is known to exhibit 
bactericidal activity, wood preservative activity, and 
repelling activity for water microbial (disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 14756/1965, 
31220/1969, and 58885/1985, respectively]. It is also 
reported that 3-iodopropiolic acid (I-C≡C-COOH) and 
esters or derivatives thereof have exhibited 
antifungal activity [Ann. Applied Biol., Vol. 36, page 
250 (1949); Japanese J. Pharmacology, Vol. 90, page 
1578 (1970)]. The present patent assignee synthesized 
a large number of N-substituted-3-iodopropiolamides 
and reported that these compounds have antibacterial 
and antifungal activities [European Patent No. 0519427 
(A1)]. On the other hand, 3-chloropropiolamide (Cl-C≡CONH₂), 
N-branched alkyl derivatives thereof and 
bridged ring alkyl-substituted derivatives thereof are 
known compounds, of which biological activities are 
not disclosed [J. Chem. Soc. C, (3), page 406 (1969); 
J. Chem. Soc. C, (11), page 2147 (1971); Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 17579/1978]. Further, 3-bromopropiolic  
 
acid (Br-C≡COOH₂) and methyl 3-bromopropiolate 
(Br-C≡CO₂CH₃) are known compounds, of 
which biological activities are not disclosed 
[Berichte, Vol. 63B, page 1868 (1930); J. Am. Chem. 
Soc., Vol. 71, page 2948 (1949); Ann. Chem., Vol. 2, 
page 819 (1957); Japanese Patent Publication No. 
40402/1988; Synth. Comm., Vol. 22, page 567 (1992)]. Accordingly, an object of the present invention 
is to provide a novel compound which has a different 
chemical structure from those of the compounds 
disclosed in the above mentioned articles and patent 
gazettes, and which exhibits superior antibacterial 
and antifungal activities. The present inventors have discovered novel N-substituted-3-halopropiolamide 
compounds having 
superior and wide-ranging antibacterial and antifungal 
activities. Compounds in accordance with the present 
invention have been discovered to exhibit superior 
antibacterial and antifungal activities against (1) 
gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, 
and Bacillus subtilis; (2) gram-negative bacteria 
such as
