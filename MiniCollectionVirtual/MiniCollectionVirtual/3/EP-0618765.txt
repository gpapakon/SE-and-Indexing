<ABSTRACT>
A suction lawn mower has a sucking air flow generator for sucking-in grass blades (14) through an inlet (16) arranged in the housing. The inlet (16) is oriented at an adjustable angle of up to 80 DEG  in relation to the normal growth direction of the grass blades (14), ensuring an in-depth action of the sucking air flow and allowing grass blades especially in the area of walls, tree trunks and posts (1) on the roadside to be sucked-in and cut down. The invention may be used as an appliance in itself or as an accessory appliance for conventional lawn mowers.

Vacuum mower with case (6)
 
a device for generating an air stream to transport cut off 

blades of grass (14) within the mower,
 
with an intake opening (16), as well as at least one 

cutting device immediately behind the intake opening (16) 
for cutting off the blades of grass,
 
with the cutting device having at least one blade (7),
 
and where in an operating position the minimum distance 

between the intake opening and the ground is kept by 
distance means so that in operating mode the intake opening 

will follow the contour of the ground, characterized in
 
that the plane as defined by the intake opening (16) in the 

operating position of the vacuum mower forms an angle of 
less than 80 degrees with the normal direction of growth of 

the grass blades (14)
 
and that the device for generating the air stream is 

powerful enough to make not yet cut grass in around the 
intake opening (16) bend into it to be cut there. 
Vacuum mower as in claim 1, characterized in that the 
cutting device respectively the blade (7) is part of said 

device and is mechanically operated and when in operation 
preferably will create the air stream itself. 
Vacuum mower as in claim 1, characterized in that the 
device for producing a vacuum generated air stream and the 

blade (7) are positioned in a particular tubular case (6) 
the knife (7) rotating freely on a bearing and being driven 

by said air stream. 
Vacuum mower as in one of the above claims characterized 
in that the angle of application is less than 20 degrees 

and/or in which this angle can be varied by a special 
mechanism.  

 
Vacuum mower as in one of the above claims and 
characterized in that it is designed to be attached to a 

conventional motor mower (3) wherein the cutting device (7) 
and/or the device for producing a vacuum air stream is 

preferably driven by a belt (4a), a shaft or the like by 
the motor of the motor mower (3) or by a separate - as for 

example hydraulic motor - possibly with a friction clutch 
regulated by the speed of rotation. 
Vacuum mower as in claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the 
blade (7) running in a case (6) constitutes the mowing 

device of a motor scythe (freely movable cutter). 
Vacuum mower as in one of the above claims characterized 
in that the casing (6) has an intake opening (16) opposite 

the discharge opening (17) which when in operation is 
oriented towards a grass collecting container (11), towards 

the case of a lawn mower (3a) or towards the ground. 
Vacuum mower as in one of the above claims characterized 
in that the intake opening (16) of which has an adjustable 

cover (9) which may be closed completely or is protected by 
rods (8) or a grill, etc. 
Vacuum mower as in one of the above claims characterized 
in that the intake opening (16) is placed in the area of 

the front or back wheels (12a) of a lawn mower, in 
particular in the area of the felloe of a wheel (12a) of a 

lawn mover and/or the casing (6) has a spiral shape. 
Vacuum mower as in one of the above claims characterized 
in that the motor (4) of the cutting device, respectively 

the blade (7), is linked to a safety device that will kill 
the motor when lawn mower is not being pushed with both 

hands and/or which will stop the cutting device (7) as soon 
as the lawn mower is not being moved forwards or backwards.
