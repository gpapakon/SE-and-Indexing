<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a filter using a digital integrator which forms the sum, weighted by a coefficient B of input data (E) of q1 bits arriving at a frequency F. The integrator comprises: a first p-bit right-shift register (30); a second q-bit right-shift register (36) (q1
<
/=q
<
/=p) connected in a loop and holding the current input data (E(k)) in its high-order bits; and an adder (32) comprising two inputs linked respectively to the outputs of the first and second shift registers, and an output linked to the input of the first shift register. A sequencer (42) enables the shift by the first register during p clock cycles and the shift by the second register during q clock cycles, commencing b cycles after the start of the said p cycles, the number b being chosen as a function of the coefficient B.

A digital integrating filter that
establishes the sum, weighted by a coefficient B, of q1-bit

input data (E) arriving at a frequency F,
characterized in that it includes:


a first p-bit shift-right register (30);
a clock of frequency (NF) at least p times
higher than frequency F;
a second q-bit shift-right register (36)
(q1µqµp), circularly connected and storing the current

input data (E(k)) in its most significant bits;
a full bit adder (32) having two inputs
respectively connected to the outputs of the first and

second shift registers, an output connected to the input
of the first shift register, a carry output (Cout), and a

carry input (Cin) receiving the carry output delayed by
one clock cycle; and
a sequencer (42) for enabling the shifting of
the first register during p clock cycles, and the

shifting of the second register during q clock cycles
starting b cycles after the beginning of the p cycles,

number b being selected as a function of coefficient B.
The integrator of claim 1, including a
multiplexer (40) controlled by the sequencer to provide

the adder with the output bits of the second shift
register (36) during the ql first cycles of said q

cycles, and the sign bit (SGN) of the current input data
after the q1 cycles until, at least, the end of said p

cycles.
The integrator of claim 1, wherein number
b is chosen such that B = 2
b-p+q1
. 
A digital low-pass filter of the first
order including an integrator according to claim 1,

wherein the clock frequency is at least 2p times higher
than the frequency F, routing means (K) controlled by the

sequencer (42) for connecting the first shift register
circularly (30) and the input of the second shift

register (36) to the output of the adder (32) after said
p clock cycles, the sequencer being designed to enable

the shifting of the first register during p additional
cycles, and the shifting of the second register until the

end of the p additional cycles after a delay of 
a
 cycles
from the beginning of the p additional cycles, the

content of the second register being provided as a filter
output after the p additional cycles, and number 
a
 being
selected as a function of a weighting coefficient A of

the input data (E).
The filter of claim 4, including a
multiplexer (40) controlled by the sequencer to provide

the adder with the output bits of the second shift
register (36) during the first q1 cycles of said p

additional cycles, and the sign bit (SGN) of the current
input data after the first q1 cycles until the end of
