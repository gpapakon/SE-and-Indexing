<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to halichondrins and compounds
related thereto, such as synthetic intermediates of
halichondrins and derivatives of such intermediates.Halichondrins are a class of polyether macrolides
isolated originally from the marine sponge Halichondria
okadai Kadota. Examples of halichondrins include
halichondrin B, homohalichondrin B and homohalichondrin B,
the structures of which have all been elucidated.
Halichondrins exhibit an extraordinary in vitro and in vivo
antitumor activity. However, the very limited supply of
halichondrins from natural sources has prevented the full
evaluation of their potential clinical applications.One aspect of the present invention relates to novel
compounds that can be used to synthesize halichondrin B and
norhalichondrin B, as well as derivatives of these novel
compounds. One class of compounds of this invention has the
following formula:

   in which each of R1 and R2 is H- or C1-10 alkyl,
alkenyl or alkynyl (preferably, C1-6 alkyl, e.g., methyl);
and each of A and B is H-, HO- with or without an alcohol
protecting group, an unsubstituted hydrocarbon, or a
substituted hydrocarbon with or without an alcohol
protecting group; wherein the total carbon number of A and B
ranges from 0-18 (not counting the carbons in any alcohol
protecting groups, if present); and each of m and n is 0-3
(preferably, 1).Note that a line between two atoms in the structural
formulas disclosed herein indicates a single bond unless
otherwise stated.The term "substituted hydrocarbon" or "substituted
alkyl" refers to a hydrocarbon or an alkyl which contains a
functional group, such as halogen, keto, aldehyde, ester,
amino, or alcohol (-OH). When the functional group is -OH,
it can be protected by an alcohol protecting group. Alcohol
protecting groups include, but are not limited to, 
R5-O-, R5-CO-O-, R5-O-CO-O-, or

in which R5 is
C1-10 alkyl, C2-10 alkenyl, C2-10 alkynyl, C7-20 aralkyl, C7-20
alkaryl, phenyl or tetrahydropyranyl, and each of R6, R7 and
R8 is C1-6 alkyl, C2-6 alkenyl or phenyl. Note that the
oxygen at the right end of the above listed alcohol
protecting groups refers to the same oxygen in an -OH which
is intended to be protected.Below are four examples of alcohol protecting
groups:
p-methoxyphenylmethyl (MePhCH2O- or "MPM"),

(t-butyldimethylsilyl or "TBS"), pivaloyl ("Pv") and
CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-O-.It is preferred that each of A and B in the above
formula be HO-, HO- linked to an alcohol protecting group,
or a substituted hydrocarbon selected from the group
consisting of
