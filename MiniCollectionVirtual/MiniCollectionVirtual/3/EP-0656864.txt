<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a flexible conveyor system with several processing stations for the assembly and/or treatment of components or assemblies which has conveyor means (29) to convey the workpiece holders (19) receiving the components or assemblies and is designed with a main conveyor track and possibly branches therefrom for the workpiece holders (19) circulating thereon, in which a plurality of modules of the same length arranged one behind the other, each with a to and fro conveyor section (11, 12), form a main circulation track and each module can take at least one processing station. The module with the to and fro conveyor sections (11, 12) forms a basic module (10). The branch sections take the form of a branch module (20) with two mutually parallel transverse conveyor tracks (21) and (22) having opposing travel directions, and a branch section (23) running between them. The branch module (20) can be coupled to at least one of the to and fro conveyor sections (11, 12) of the main circulation section of the basic module (10).

Flexible conveyor system for one or more working 
stations for the fitting and/or working of parts or 

assemblies, which has conveyor means for the conveyance 
of workpiece carriers (19) receiving the parts or assemblies 

and is designed with a main circulatory track and 
off-branching branch segments for the workpiece carriers 

(19) circulating thereon, a plurality of equal-length 
modules disposed one behind the other in the longitudinal 

direction forming with a respective outbound and return 
section a main circulatory track segment and each module 

being capable of receiving at least one working station, 
characterized in that deflection units (30) are disposed 

at the ends of the main circulatory track, in that each 
module having the outbound and return conveyor section 

(11, 12) forms a basic module (10), in that the branch 
segments are designed as shunt modules (20) with, 

respectively, two transverse conveyor tracks (21, 22) 
having two mutual
ly parallel and opposite-running transport 
directions and with a branch section (23) running 

between the transverse conveyor tracks (21, 22), and in 
that each shunt module (20) can be coupled by corresponding 

means to at least one of the two outbound and 
return conveyor sections (11, 12) of the main circulatory 

track segment of a basic module (10). 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that along the two main circulatory 

track segments (11, 12) there are respectively provided 
two mounting surfaces, disposed at a distance from the 

transverse conveyor tracks (21, 22), for the reception of  
 

transfer units (17) for the feed-in and feed-out of 
workpiece carriers (19) from the outbound and return 

conveyor section (11, 12) to the evacuating transverse 
conveyor track (21) and from the supplying transverse 

conveyor track (22) to the outbound and return conveyor 
section (11, 12) respectively. 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that at least one basic module (10) is 

equipped at the feed-in and feed-out points with transfer 
units (17). 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the transfer units (17) are lifting-shunt 

units, which raise the workpiece carrier (19) 
from the conveyor means and return it to the conveyor 

means and shift it to the adjacent conveyor track. 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the outbound and return conveyor 

section (11, 12) of each basic module (10) and the branch 
segments (21 to 23) of each shunt module (20) are respectively 

mounted on a stand, so that the conveyor means 
(29) of both modules (10, 20) lie in one plane. 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the stand of the basic module (10) 

is provided in the longitudinal direction, at both ends, 
with respective means for the attachment of a further 

basic module (10) and transversely to the longitudinal 
direction, on both sides, with respective means for the 

attachment of a respective shunt module (20). 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the distance of the conveyor means 

of the adjacent modules from the respective means for the 
attachment of the modules is fixed. 
Flexible conveyor system according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the spacing between the adjacent 

conveyor means is dimensioned such that the workpiece 
carriers (19) can shift or be fed in and out without 

difficulty from one conveyor track to the adjacent 
conveyor track. 
Flexible conveyor system according to one of the  
 

preceding claims, characterized in that the basic module 
(10) and the shunt module (20) are respectively interchangeable.
