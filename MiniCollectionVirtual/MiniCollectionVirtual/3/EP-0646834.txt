<ABSTRACT>
In a color photographic printer of the type 
having a film scanner having a 50% green spectral response 

between 522±5nm and 570±2.5nm and peaking at 550nm, a 
lowpass cutoff filter (40) for lowering the upper cutoff 

wavelength of the green channel response is added to the 
green channel to improve the color correction of the 

printer for all color films presently in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photographic color
printers, and more particularly to such color printers
having a scanner for scanning negative color originals and
determining the amount of exposure required in each of the
primary colors during printing.It is well known in photographic color printers
to employ a scanning system to scan a photographic negative
to determine the amount of exposure required in each of
three primary colors for printing the photographic negative
onto photographic color paper. U.S. patent 4,589,766
issued May 20, 1986 to Fursich et al discloses a color
copier having such a scanning system and teaches that if
the spectral sensitivities of the measuring system and the
copying system are exactly matched, the type of
photosensitive material or film being printed in the copier
is of no consequence. A copying system as used herein
means a given photographic paper exposed by a given printer
lamp. Thus, theoretically, if the spectral sensitivities
of the color channels in the scanner exactly match the
spectral sensitivities of the color photographic paper in
the photographic printer, the exposure in the printer can
be controlled so as to obtain properly colored copies
independently of the type of dye or density of the masks
used in making the film.Although in theory this may be correct, in
practice it has not proven to be feasible to achieve a
wavelength by wavelength match between the spectral
response of the scanning system and the spectral response
of the photographic paper in a color photographic printer.
This has been due to the difficulty and expense of 
designing color filters and light source combinations for
the scanner that exactly match the spectral sensitivity of
the photographic paper at all wavelengths. For example, a
line of photographic printers of the type described in U.S.
patent 4,589,766 is manufactured and sold by the AGFA
corporation as the MSP and MSC printers. The MSP and MSC
printers are designed to be used with all kinds of film
without the need to readjust the printer for film type.
Figure 3 shows a measured spectral response of the scanner
in an AGFA MSP printer with filters designed to be used
with Kodak color photographic paper versus a typical
spectral response of the Kodak color photographic paper
when exposed by the MSP printer lamp. The curves labeled
10, 12, and 14 are the measured spectral response curves of
the blue, green and red channels of the scanner
respectively. The curves labeled 16, 18, and 20 are the
measured spectral response curves of the
