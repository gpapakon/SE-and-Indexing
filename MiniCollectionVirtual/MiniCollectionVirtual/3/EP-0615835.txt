<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is an automatic process for determining, monitoring and controlling a forced draining phase prior to the pressing in discontinuous fruit presses. Automatic process, characterised in that it consists, after filling of the fruit press (1) and before beginning the normal pressing cycle, in continuously measuring the rate of flow of the liquids without applying pressing pressure, in noting the minimum value and maximum value of the said rate, in particular when the vat of the fruit press (1) is rotating, in then comparing these values respectively with predetermined quantities, then, as a function of the results of the said comparisons, in carrying out, if appropriate, a forced draining phase on the materials to be pressed (2), simultaneously verifying the possible presence of a blocking of the orifices (3) for discharge of the liquids, in repeating the above operations until the results of the abovementioned comparisons no longer involve carrying out a forced draining phase and, finally, in beginning the normal pressing cycle.

Automatic process for determining, controlling and 
monitoring a forced draining phase prior to pressing in 

discontinuous presses, characterised in that, after filling 
the press (1) and prior to beginning the normal pressing 

cycle (C), it consists in continuously measuring the flow 
rate (D) of the liquids without applying pressing pressure, 

recording the minimum value, Dmin, and the maximum value, 
Dmax, of the said flow rate (D), in particular when the vat 

of the press (1) is rotating, then comparing these values 

(Dmin and Dmax) respectively with predetermined quantities 
(K1 x Do and K2 x Do), then, as a function of the results 

of the said comparisons, if necessary, effecting forced 
draining of the material to be pressed (2), simultaneously 

checking for possible clogging of the outlets (3) for the 
liquids, repeating the preceding operations until the 

results of the aforesaid comparisons no longer imply forced 
draining and, finally, beginning the normal pressing cycle 

(C). 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
consists in effecting forced draining of the material to be 

pressed (2) solely when at least one of the following 
conditions is established: 


Dmax ≥ K1 x Do or Dmin ≥ K2 X Do, 
 
where K1 is a constant with a value of between 0.5 and 2, 

K2 is a constant with a value of between 0.05 and 0.4 and 
Do is a flow rate value determined as a function of the 

dimensions and filling ratio of the vat of the press (1). 
Process according to either of claims 1 and 2,  
 

characterised in that the forced draining of the material 
to be pressed (2) consists firstly in evacuating the air 

(4) contained in the vat of the press (1), then effecting 
controlled pressing at low pressure, followed by 

decompression of the said vat. 
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that the air 
(4) contained in the vat of the press (1) is expelled from 

the said vat via the outlets (3) and at least one drain 
(3') provided for the discharge of the liquids, the said 

vat being positioned in such a manner that the said outlets 
(3) and the said drain (3') are situated partly above the 

vat, the air (4) then being expelled by the material to be 
pressed (2) rising in the vat by the action of the pressing 

member. 
Process according to either of claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that, after evacuation of the air (4) 

contained in the vat of the press (1), the controlled 
pressing at low pressure for forced draining consists in 

applying a first pressing pressure (P1) of low value for a 
period of time (T1) determined as a function of the flow of 

the liquids, then, provided that no clogging of the outlets 
(3) for the liquids has been detected during the first 

pressure stage (P1), applying a second pressing pressure 
(P2) of greater intensity than the first pressure (P1) and 

then effecting decompression and optionally mixing of the 
material to be pressed (2) after the second pressure stage 

(P2). 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
second pressure stage (P2) is maintained for at least a  

 
predetermined period of time (T2) and, if necessary, beyond 

the latter until the flow rate (D) of the liquids extracted 
falls below a set point, D2, a function of Do. 
Process according to claims 2 and 5, characterised in that 
the outlets (3) for the liquids are considered to be 

clogged when, after the application of the first pressure 
(P1) for a period of time (TC) during a forced draining 

phase, the flow rate (D) of the liquids extracted is less 
than Do, whereas 
Dmin ≥ K2 x Do
 during the phase preceding 
the application of the first pressure (P1). 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that, after the detection of clogging, it 

consists in prolonging the application of the first 
pressure (P1) for a predetermined period of time (TP), then 

clearing the clogged outlets (3) by effecting thorough 
mixing of the material to be pressed (2) after 

decompression.
