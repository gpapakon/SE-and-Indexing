<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin film
transistor, and more specifically, relates to a thin
film transistor suitably used as a switching element
for selectively switching a pixel electrode for an
active matrix liquid crystal display apparatus.Figure 43 is a plan view of a first conventional
thin film transistor (hereinafter, referred to
as a TFT) used for an active matrix liquid crystal
apparatus, and Figure 44 is a sectional view of the TFT
taken along the line X44-X44 of Figure 43. Referring
to Figures 43 and 44, the first conventional TFT includes
a gate electrode 1, a gate insulating film 8, a
semiconductor layer 7 made of amorphous silicon, an
etching stopper layer 6, ohmic contact layers 4 and 5
made of a phosphorus-doped semiconductor, and source
and drain electrodes 2 and 3. All of these layers are
formed in this order on an insulating substrate 9. The
TFT having the above structure is called an inverted
staggered type transistor.Figure 45 is a plan view of a second conventional
TFT, and Figure 46 is a sectional view of the
TFT taken along the line X46-X46 of Figure 45. The
second conventional TFT is also an inverted staggered
type transistor though it does not include an etching
stopper layer as in the first conventional TFT. Figure 47 is a plan view of a third conventional
TFT, and Figure 48 is a sectional view of the
TFT taken along the line X48-X48 of Figure 47. Referring

includes source and drain electrodes 2 and 3, ohmic
contact layers 4 and 5 made of a phosphorus-doped
semiconductor, a semiconductor layer 7 made of amorphous
silicon, a gate insulating film 8, and a gate
electrode 1. All of these layers are formed in this
order on an insulating substrate 9. The TFT having the
above structure is called a staggered type transistor.
Besides the transistors of the above-described types,
those having structures called a inverted coplanar type
as well as a coplanar type have also been realized.
Figures 49 and 50 show TFTs of the inverted coplanar
type and the coplanar type, respectively.All of the above conventional TFTs include
the ohmic contact layers 4 and 5 made of amorphous
silicon doped with phosphorus (hereinafter, referred to
as a-Si(n+)). They also have overlap portions 10, as
shown in Figure 44 for example, where part of the
source electrode 2 and part of the drain electrode 3
are located right above part of the gate electrode 1
with the gate insulating film 8 therebetween.A case where the source electrode 2 and the
drain electrode
