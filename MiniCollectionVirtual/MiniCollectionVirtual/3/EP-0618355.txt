<ABSTRACT>
This method is characterised in that it consists in deriving a filtered engine-speed signal (NF) representing fluctuations (oscillations) in the engine speed (N), and in slaving this filtered engine-speed signal to 0 in order to damp out the fluctuations in the engine speed, by calculating a correction to be made to the engine torque and determination of the corresponding correction (CP) to be applied to the said parameter for controlling the operation of the engine, with the aid of a digital governor (3), the parameters of which have been calculated beforehand on the basis of an engine-torque estimating model into which the parameters for controlling the operation of the engine have been entered, and of a filtered transmission estimating model for each gearbox ratio.

A method for controlling the operation of an internal combustion engine of an 
automotive vehicle, by controlling at least one parameter (P1) for controlling the 

operation of this engine (1), characterised in that it consists in producing a filtered engine 
speed (NF) signal which is representative of the oscillations of the engine speed (N), and 

in locking in this filtered engine speed (NF) signal at 0, in order to deaden the 
oscillations of the engine speed, by calculating an adjustment to be made to the engine 

torque and by determining the corresponding adjustment (CP) to be applied to the said 
parameter for controlling the operation of the engine with the aid of a digital regulator 

(3) with its parameters calculated in advance using an estimator model of the engine 
torque into which the parameters for controlling the operation of the engine and for a 

filtered transmission estimator model are entered, for each gearbox ratio. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the digital regulator (3) is a 
RST-structure regulator which receives a direct action control signal produced using the 

engine torque (Uo) to control the speed of acceleration of the vehicle. 
A method according to either Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the regulator has a 
period of constant sampling. 
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the estimator model (B/A) for 
filtered transmission is identified using the average engine speed at each sampling period 

of the regulator and a filtered speed obtained using a linearly interpolated speed between 
speed values measured at two determined angular references of the engine, which angular 

references surround the sampling moment. 
A method according to Claim 4, characterised in that the filtered speed is obtained by 
passing of the interpolated speed into at least a second order high-pass filter. 
A device for controlling the operation of an internal combustion engine of an automotive 
vehicle for implementing the method according to any one of the preceding claims with 

means for controlling at least one parameter (P1) for controlling the operation of this 
engine (1), characterised in that it comprises means (2) for producing a filtered engine 

speed signal representative of engine speed (N) oscillations, and a regulator (3) for 
locking in this filtered engine signal at 0, wherein this regulator comprises means for  

 
calculating an adjustment to be made to the engine torque and for determining the 

corresponding adjustment (CP) to be applied to the said parameter for control of 
operation of the engine, wherein the parameters of the regulator are calculated in advance 

using the estimator model of the engine torque into which the parameters for controlling 
the operation of the engine and for a transmission filtered estimator model are entered, 

for each gearbox ratio.
