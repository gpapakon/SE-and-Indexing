<ABSTRACT>
The invention features immunoreagents which 
neutralize the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) 

by binding to a novel conserved epitope of the HIV-1 
gp120. These immunoreagents exhibit a broad neutralizing 

effect upon HIV attachment to host cells, and are 
therefore useful in the detection, prevention, 

amelioration and treatment of HIV disease, primarily AIDS 
(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and ARC (AIDS Related 

Complex). More particularly, the invention relates to 
novel human monoclonal antibodies selectively reactive to 

a conserved conformation dependent determinant of the HIV-1 
gp120, derivatives thereof, cell lines that produce 

these antibodies, and the use of the monoclonal antibodies 
and their derivatives for the detection, prevention, 

amelioration and treatment of HIV related disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of immunotherapy. 
Specifically, the invention relates to the development of 
antibodies and derivatives thereof, cell lines that 
secrete the antibodies, and their method of use in the 
prevention, detection, amelioration or treatment of HIV 
disease, primarily AIDS (Acquired Inmunodeficiency 
Syndrome) and ARC (AIDS Related Complex). Recent scientific inquiry has focused upon an 
extracellular glycoprotein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
Type 1 (HIV-1), namely gp120. This glycoprotein is 
believed to play a vital role in attachment of HIV-1 to a 
host cell, by binding specifically to the host cell's 
cellular receptor CD4 and therefore important for the 
development of an AIDS vaccine. However, the gene 
encoding gp120 is highly variable among different HIV-1 
strains, including sequential isolates from the same 
patient (1-4). The greatest variability has been 
demonstrated in several hypervariable regions which are 
flanked by more conserved regions (3, 4). In response to the AIDS virus, the host immune system 
will produce antibodies targeted against various antigenic  
 
sites, 
or determinants, of gp120. Some of those antibodies will have a 
neutralizing effect and will inhibit HIV infectivity. It is 
believed that this neutralizing effect is due to the antibodies' 
ability to interfere with HIV's cellular attachment. It is also 
believed that this effect may explain in part, the rather long 
latency period between the initial seroconversion and the onset of 
clinical symptoms. Much of our present knowledge about which domains of 
gp120 are immunogenic has come from studies of antibodies raised in 
laboratory animals. It was first observed that a variety of 
animals immunized with purified or recombinant gp120 or gp160 
developed strain specific neutralizing antibodies (5-7). 
Subsequently, polyclonal animal antisera raised to recombinant or 
synthetic peptides representing the third hypervariable domain (V3) 
of gp120 (covering amino acid residues 307-330) were found to 
manifest similar strain specific neutralizing activity. This 
observation identified the V3 domain as a major target of 
neutralization, at least in laboratory animals (8,9). The V3 
hypervariable region is flanked by conserved cysteine residues 
which may form a disulfide bond and define a "loop" region 
containing the largely conserved sequence Gly-Pro-Gly in its 
center. Synthetic loop region peptides have been found to elicit 
the production of antibodies that neutralize only virus obtained 
fr
