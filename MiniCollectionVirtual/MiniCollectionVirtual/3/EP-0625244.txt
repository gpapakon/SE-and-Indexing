<ABSTRACT>
A scroll compressor (10) comprising a stationary scroll member (12) including an end plate (14) and a stationary involute wrap (16) extending from the end plate (14), and a discharge port (18) defined within the end plate (14). The scroll compressor (10) has an orbiting scroll member (20) including an orbiting involute wrap (16) which is movable in cooperative relationship with the stationary involute wrap scroll (12) so that a pair of sealed pockets (26, 28) is formed therebetween, the volume of the sealed pockets (26, 28) being reduced as orbital motion progresses. A relief port (32) extends through the end plate (14), in communication with one of the sealed pockets (26, 28) so that at any given point of orbital motion, there is a pressure imbalance between pockets in the pair of sealed pockets (26, 28), and a consequent diminution in noise and vibration of the scroll compressor (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scroll compressor 
for use in a refrigeration system, such as an air 
conditioner. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a scroll compressor including a relief port which 
causes a pressure imbalance between a gaseous medium 
confined by sealed pockets disposed within the compressor, 
together with a consequent diminution of noise and 
vibration. Scroll compressors are increasingly used to compress 
gasses in energy-efficient residential heat pumps and in 
refrigeration systems such as air conditioners. Uses of 
scroll compressors include their application in vacuum 
pumps, pumps for various liquids, gas expanders, and engine 
blowers. In such compressors, there is a stationary scroll 
member having an end plate and an involute or spiral wrap 
extending therefrom. A discharge port is typically defined 
within the end plate. Disposed in inter meshing relationship 
with the stationary scroll is an orbiting scroll, which also 
extends from an end plate. The orbiting scroll member is 
operatively connected to a driving shaft by a short-throw 
crank mechanism so that any given point on the orbiting 
scroll member describes an orbital trajectory in relation to 
a given point on the stationary scroll member. The two scroll members are phased 180Â° apart, i.e., one 
is a mirror image of the other. During relative motion 
between the stationary and orbiting scroll members, sealed 
pockets are formed between inter meshing involute scrolls, 
within which the gas to be compressed is confined. As 
orbital motion progresses, the sealed pockets undergo a 
reduction in volume. As a result, the sealed pockets act as 
compression chambers while the entrapped gas undergoes 
progressive confinement. In such compressors, suction refrigerant gas enters the 
stationary and orbiting scroll members at their outer 
periphery. The meshing of the scrolls forms crescent-shaped  
 
pockets, which, starting from the periphery, reduce in size, 
thereby increasing the pressure of the trapped gas. The 
outer-most pockets which are initially open to a suction 
chamber are sealed off as the orbiting scroll member touches 
the outside end of the fixed scroll member. The closed 
pockets move radially inward until they coalesce in 
communication with the discharge port, resulting in the 
expulsion of gas under high pressure. The scroll compressor is uni-directional. It functions 
as a compressor when rotated in one direction, and as an 
expander when rotated in the opposite direction. By
