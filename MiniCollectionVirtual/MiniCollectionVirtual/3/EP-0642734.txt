<ABSTRACT>
With the present invention we succeed to the collection 
and transportation of the bees during 24 hours.

 
   The bees collector is consisted of the axe (1) 

with the small screws with the help of the springs (2) 
and the centralised parties (4) goes and comes in the 

inside parts (comb) of the main body. The side pieces 
are adjusted to the body and to the beeshive completing 

the possible space of every beeshive, and the secure 
airing of it. 
The cover (8) helps to the stabilising of the screws 
of the axe. 
The square tubes (6) with the crosses, operate 
as valves of one direction, not allowing the exit of the 

bees. 
For bigger security in the transportation we use 
the tubs (taps) that close in the external part the 

tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an instrument of collection and 
transportation of bees. With this instrument the collection 
and the transportation of bees is obtained any 
moment during 24 hours. The invention is original and does not exist all over 
the world any other instrument of collection and transportation 
of bees during the day. Up today the transportation of bees is done only during 
the night. With the present instrument the transportation 
during the day is obtained offering bigger facility 
to the bees producers during the transportation of 
the beehive. During the transportation of the beehive 
the airing of the bees is complete through the opening 
of the instrument that remains open so that the air in 
beehive is recycled and so we have the secure transportation 
of the bees without losses. More analytically we see at (pic.1) the bees collector 
and at (pic.2) the analytical pieces. The axe (1) is consisted of a metal stick, bears pending 
pieces (screws) and at the edges one attraction 
spring (2). With the help of the spring and another 
two pieces (centralised) (4) we make the up and down 
of the axe(1) in openings that have the shape of comb 
(b) for the stable movement of the pending pieces  
 
that bears the axe (1), that is used for entrance and 
exit of the bees. There are two springs on the right and the left (2). 
The upper parts enter at the edges of the axe(1). The 
lower parts are staale entering in two screws (each 
spring). They are used for the stabilisation of the 
central axe (1).
 
   Two oblong cylinder bases (3) for the help of 
the covers support each one bearing a screw.
 
   Two centralised parts (4) which are used for the 
up and down of the axe (1). Its use is done with oblong 
screw which enters through (4) at the lower 
part of the piece, and has the ability with a special 
key alen to allow the operation up and down. 
At the lower part of the main body there are incorporation 
tubes (5) that are used for the entrance 
of the bees.
 
   There are square tubes (6) which enter in the 
tubes (5) and on the other hand there are moving 
crosses (one for every tube), supported freely at the 
upper part of each tube (16). These crosses allow the entrance of the bees and 
do not allow the exit because they are moving only 
to side of the entrance. The piece (7) is a double cover (tap) which is used  
 
to close the tubes (5) because during the transportation 
for any reason the pending crosse may ope and we may 
have some loss. In the cover (8) there are holes for the

<CLAIMS>
The Bees Collector is consisted from the central axe (1) 
which bears screws, by springs (2), by oblong basis (3), by 

centralised parts (4), by square tubes (5), by square 
tubes (6) with the pending crosses, by a special part (7), 

from the cover (8) and by the side pieces (9). 
The Bees Collector according to the claim Number 1, is 
characterised by the fact that the springs (2) and the 

centralised parts (40 help the up and down of the central 
axe (1) for the collection or not of the bees. 
The Bees Collection according to the claim Number 
1 is characterised by the fact that the cover (8) is stabilised 

with the help of oblong bases (3). 
The Bees Collector according to the claim number 
1 is characterised by the fact that the tubes (5) and the 

square tubes (6) bearing a special cross prohibit the 
exit of the bess and allow only the entrance of the bees 

to the beehive. 
The bees collector according to the claim 1 
is characterised by the fact that it bears tubs (7) 

for the 
external closing of the square tubes (5) and (6). 
The bees Collector according to claim number 1 
is characterised by the special moving side pieces 

(9) which are adjusted at the entrance of beehive no 
 

matter of the size of the beehive securing though the 
safe air of it.
