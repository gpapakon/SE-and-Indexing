<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to basic polynucleate 
aluminum hydroxy silicate sulfate (PASS) compounds and to 
a process for their preparation. These compounds act as flocculants, coagulating 
agents, precipitating agents, dewatering agents and 
clarifiers useful in industries such as water treatment, 
pulp and paper, or wherever an aluminum hydroxide gel 
system resulting from such polymeric compounds can be 
employed. Compounds of this type, processes for their 
production, and specific uses are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,981,675, issued on January 1, 1991 and U.S. Patent 
5,069,893 issued on December 3, 1991, both assigned to the 
same assignee as the present application. Attention is directed in particular to European 
patent application EP 0 372 715 published on June 13, 1990 
and assigned to the same assignee as the present 
application (corresponding to U.S. patent 4,981,675 
already listed above). This application discloses 
polynucleate aluminum hydroxy silicate-sulfate solutions 
and compounds produced by a one-step process involving 
reacting an aluminum sulfate solution with an alkali metal 
silicate solution and an alkali aluminate solution under 
high shear mixing conditions. The solution and compound 
produced by this process are useful, in particular, for 
reducing water turbidity. While these compounds and processes are effective and 
useful, there is still room for improvement both in the 
form in which the compounds are prepared and in their 
processes of preparation. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a novel family of basic polynucleate aluminum 
hydroxy silicate sulfate compounds and solutions and novel  
 
processes for producing the same. The present invention, in one form, comprises a 
process for producing a polynucleate basic aluminum 
hydroxy silicate sulfate having an average chemical 
composition indicated by the formula: 
AlA(OH)B(SO₄)C(SiOX)D(H₂O)E 
wherein: 
A is the number 1.0; B is a number from 0.75 to 2.0; C is a number from 0.30 to 1.12; D is a number from 0.005 to 0.1; x is a number greater than 2 but less than or 
equal to 4, 
   such that 3 = B + 2C + 2D(x-2); and E is a number greater than 8 for products in 
solution form and less than 8 for products in solid form; the polynucleate compounds having a basicity defined 
by B/3A x 100 in the range of 25 - 66%; with the provisos that up to 10 molar % of the amount 
of Al indicated in the above formula may be replaced by an 
equivalent amount of another multi-valent cation and up to 
10
