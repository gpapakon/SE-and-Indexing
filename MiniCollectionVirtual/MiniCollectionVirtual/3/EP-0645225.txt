<ABSTRACT>
A tile cutter has an elongated base plate (1), which has a transversely directed tile fence (16) and a longitudinally directed breaking web (14), and a slide (7) which is displaceable on a horizontal guide (4) above the breaking web (14) and on which a bell-crank lever (8) having a cutting wheel (12), a breaker head (13) and an actuating arm (10) is pivotably mounted, the part of the base plate (1) which lies on one side of the breaking web (14) forming a tile-supporting area (1a) of at least a hand's breadth. So that narrow tile strips can also be cut exactly and quickly, provision is made for the tile-supporting area (1a) of the base plate (1) to be subdivided into a front and a rear bearing area (20, 20a) by a lateral transverse recess (18) which has a width (B) sufficient to marginally enclose a tile to be cut. The front and rear bearing areas (20, 20a) together with the breaking web (14) form reliable three-point support even for small tile strips.
