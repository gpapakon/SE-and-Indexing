<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light sensitive silver halide photographic
material, having reduced fog and improved residual stain of the image and, in particular,
to a light sensitive silver halide photographic material comprising tabular silver
halide grains.The covering power of a silver halide emulsion is a matter of a great concern
for emulsion makers, because the amount of silver required to maintain a given
optical density can be decreased by using an emulsion having a high covering
power. It is disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,411,986, 4,434,226, 4,413,053,
4,414,304, 4,414,306, 4,435,501 that the covering power of developed silver can
be greatly increased by using tabular grain emulsions having a high aspect ratio
(i.e., diameter to thickness ratio) and a small grain thickness.It is known that the use of tabular grains of a highly sensitive emulsion
having a small average grain thickness provides high covering power for silver, as
compared with the covering power of emulsions which have a large average grain
size and a large average grain thickness.Moreover, the use of intermediate (from 5:1 to 8:1) and high (more than
8:1) aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions can produce increased image sharpness,
and improved speed-granularity relationships. In radiographic elements with emulsion
coatings on each of the two opposite faces of the support, marked reductions
in crossover have been observed using intermediate and high aspect ratio tabular
grain emulsions.A disadvantage that has been discovered with the use of spectrally sensitized
tabular grain silver halide emulsions is related to a bad color tone of developed
silver of emulsion grains. The color tone of developed silver of emulsion
grains depends upon the grain size and grain thickness. The tone of tabular grains 
is yellowish, and gives an unfavorable impression to the observer of the resulting
picture image. This yellowishness is caused by the strong yellowish light produced
by the increase in scattering of blue light due to decrease in size and thickness of
the grains. In order to solve such a problem, a tone regulating agent is generally
used. For example, a certain kind of mercapto compound may be used for this purpose.
However, application of such a conventionally known tone regulating agent
to an emulsion having tabular grains causes extreme desensitization, and thus,
such an emulsion cannot be put into practice.Japanese Laid Open Patent No. 158,436/1985 discloses a technique for
improving the color tone of a silver image by including a
