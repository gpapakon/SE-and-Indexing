<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
triazolyl-substituted tertiary amine compounds having an
aromatase inhibiting activity useful as medicines.Regarding biosynthesis of estrogen in a living
body, it is known that an enzyme, aromatase, participates
in the final step of the route of the biosynthesis.
Aromatase aromatizes A ring of a steroid with a substrate
of androgen to form estrogen. Therefore, by inhibiting
this enzyme activity, prevention and curing of various
diseases to be caused by estrogen as an exacerbating
factor are possible.On the basis of this knowledge, some aromatase
inhibiting compounds have heretofore been proposed. As
typical examples of them are mentioned imidazolyl- or
triazolyl- or pyridyl-substituted methyl compounds
described in EP-A-0,236,940 and
EP-A- 0,293,978.However, compounds of the present invention are
structurally different from these known
compounds in that the former have a triazolyl-substituted 
tertiary amino group.US-A-5,041,458 discloses compounds of formula (I)
below wherein A is CH(CH3), ring D is 4-nitrophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl
or 4-chlorophenyl, B is 2,4-dichlorophenyl
and ring E is 1H,1,2,4-triazole; and wherein A is
CH(CH2CH3), ring D is 4-nitrophenyl and B and ring E are as
above; the compounds of US-A-5,041,458 are proposed for
use as agricultural fungicides; it is also disclosed that
"certain" of the compounds (not identified) can be used in
pharmaceutical antifungal compositions.The present invention provides aromatase-inhibiting
pharmaceutical compositions including triazolyl-substituted
tertiary amino derivatives, and the use of
these derivatives for preparation of medicaments for
treating or preventing estrogen-exacerbated disease. It
also provides such derivatives per se with the exclusion
of those disclosed in US-A-5,041,458.Triazolyl-substituted tertiary amino compounds on
which the present invention is based are represented by
the following general formula (I) :

wherein
A represents a single bond, a lower alkylene group
or a carbonyl group;B represents a lower alkyl group, an optionally 
substituted aryl group, an optionally substituted 5- or
6-membered heterocyclic group having from 1 to 3 hetero
atoms of oxygen, sulfur and/or nitrogen atoms, or an
optionally substituted bicyclic fused heterocyclic group
composed of the preceding hetero ring and a benzene ring;
D ring represents an optionally substituted aryl group,
an optionally substituted 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic
group having from 1 to 3 hetero atoms of oxygen, sulfur
and/or nitrogen atoms, or
