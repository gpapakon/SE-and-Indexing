<ABSTRACT>
A cooling system for an automotive engine has a 
first passage (6) provided between an outlet (5) of a water 

jacket (4) of the engine and an inlet (12) of a radiator (11), a 
second passage (14) provided between an outlet (13) of the 

radiator (11) and an inlet (10) of the water jacket (4), and a bypass 
passage (7) provided between the first passage (6) and the 

second passage (14). A thermostat (1) is provided in a housing (8) 
for controlling coolant passing through the first and 

second passages (6,14). A flange (15) is provided for supporting 
the thermostat (1) in the housing (8) and for closing the second 

passage (14). The flange (15) has a hole (17) having a diameter 
between 1.8 mm and 2.8 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermostat for 
an automotive engine cooling system. As shown in Fig. 1, a conventional cooling system 
for an automotive engine has a thermostat 1 which is 
disposed in an inlet side passage of water jackets 4. The cooling system comprises a first coolant 
passage 6 disposed between an upper outlet 5 of the 
water jackets 4 and an upper inlet 12 of a radiator 11, 
and a second coolant passage 14 provided between a lower 
outlet 13 of the radiator 11 and a lower inlet 10 of the 
water jackets 4, including a thermostat cap 16, a 
thermostat housing 8 and a water pump 9. A bypass 
passage 7 is provided between a junction J of the first 
passage 6 and the housing 8 so as to communicate the 
first passage 6 with the second passage 14 without 
passing the radiator 11. The thermostat 1 is secured to 
the housing 8 by the thermostat cap 16. The thermostat 
1 has a main valve 3 for closing the second passage 14 
and a bypass valve 2 for closing a bypass port of the 
bypass passage 7. In Fig. 1, the reference A' designates a measuring 
point for measuring the temperature of the coolant in 
the housing 8, and B' designates a measuring point 
provided in the second passage 14 adjacent to the  
 
thermostat cap 16 and upstream of the thermostat 1 for 
measuring the temperature of the coolant in the second 
passage 14. The reference C designates a measuring 
point for measuring the flow rate of the coolant in the 
second passage 14. A pipe used for each of the first and second 
coolant passages 6 and 14 is of 24 mm diameter, and a 
pipe used for the bypass passage 7 is of 10 mm diameter. 
When the main valve 3 is opened, the flow rate of the 
coolant at the point C passing through the radiator 11 
is 60 liters per minute. During the engine is warmed up, the main valve 3 of 
the thermostat 1 is closed, while the bypass valve 2 
integrated with the main valve 3 is fully opened. Thus, 
the coolant drawn from the outlet 5 of the water jackets 
4 does not pass through the radiator 11. The coolant is 
circulated by the water pump 9 through the junction J of 
the first passage 6, bypass passage 7, housing 8, and 
inlet 10 of the water jackets 4 as indicated by arrows. 
Thus, the temperature of the coolant in the housing 8 
quickly rises. Before the engine starts, a difference between the 
temperature A of the coolant at the point A' in the 
housing 8 and the temperature B of the coolant at the 
point B' in the passage 14 is zero. However, after the 
engine starts, since the coolant in the
