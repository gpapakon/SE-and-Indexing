<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for generating ultrasonic waves such as an ultrasonic
therapeutic apparatus suitable for medical treatment of
malignant tumors and medical treatment of thrombi and
calculi, an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus having the
function of generating ultrasonic cavitation for
emphasizing an ultrasonic echo image of, for example,
blood flow, an ultrasonic apparatus accelerating
chemical reactions, an ultrasonic cleaning apparatus for
solid surfaces, an ultrasonic bubble generating
apparatus or a sterilizing apparatus for liquid.A medical treatment of malignant tumors and a
remedy for calculi which are based on irradiation of a
converging high-intensity acoustic wave have been
expected to serve as a noninvasive modality which does
not depend on operation and as a modality which makes
much of the quality of life after operation of a patient
and-increase their social value more and more in future,
too. Acoustic cavitation is considered to play an
important role in generating the effect of medical 
treatment based on high-intensity focused acoustic wave
irradiation. It has also been known that acoustic
cavitation plays an important role also in accelerating
chemical reactions and in cleaning based on ultrasound
irradiation.As a method of efficiently inducing the
generation and collapse under pressure of acoustic
cavitation for the above purposes, a technique has
hitherto been reported as proposed in JP-A-2-126848,
according to which ultrasonic waves are irradiated by
switching acoustic fields at intervals of 1 to 100 msec.
In this technique, based on the fact that the ultrasonic
irradiation time, 1 to 100msec, is needed for generation
of acoustic cavitation, ultrasonic irradiation is
carried out while switching acoustic fields of different
wave fronts at intervals of the above time range whereby
the cycle of generation of acoustic cavitation by one
acoustic field and collapse under pressure of the
acoustic cavitation by the other acoustic field is
repeated. Through this, the efficiency of ultrasonic
chemical reaction could be an order of magnitude
improved for the same ultrasonic power in comparison
with the case without the switching of acoustic fields.In the semiconductor device production
process, high-density integration of device prevails and
concomitantly therewith, deposition of minute foreign
matters on substrates or surface contamination affect
the yield of products to a great extent. Therefore, the 
cleaning process becomes very important in the semiconductor
dev
