<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
chlorine dioxide. More particularly, this invention 
relates to the production of chlorine dioxide from a 
chloric acid solution. Chlorine dioxide has found wide use as a 
disinfectant in water treatment/purification, as a 
bleaching agent in pulp and paper production, and a 
number of other uses because of its high oxidizing 
power. There are a number of chlorine dioxide 
generator systems and processes available in the 
marketplace. Most of the very large scale generators 
utilize a chlorate salt, a chloride ion source or 
reducing agent, and a strong acid. In the presence of 
chloride ion and acid, chlorate ion reacts to produce a 
mixture of chlorine and chlorine dioxide. The chlorine 
present is an undesired by-product. Many processes have been developed to produce 
chlorine dioxide with lower chlorine concentrations by 
adding a reducing agent. Reducing agents which have 
been used include methanol or other organic compounds, 
sulfur, sulfur dioxide or other sulfur-oxygen species 
having a sulfur valence of less than +6, and carbon  
 
monoxide among others. When organic compounds are 
used, unreacted volatile organics including formic acid 
are present in the product gas. Using sulfur containing reducing agents, the 
sulfate or sulfuric acid produced accumulates as a 
waste product. When gaseous reducing agents such as 
sulfur dioxide or carbon monoxide are employed, reactor 
designs and process control systems must protect 
against unreacted reducing agent leaving the system 
with the chlorine dioxide gas. In addition, prior art processes for the production 
of chlorine dioxide from chlorate salts require an 
excess of the acid used. This acid is slowly 
neutralized by the accumulation of alkali metal ions 
that enter the process with the chlorate salt. The 
accumulation of salts must be removed as a waste 
stream, either liquid or solid, in every process 
currently practiced commercially. To avoid the formation of an acidic alkali metal 
salt, it has been proposed that chlorine dioxide be 
prepared from chloric acid. Chloric acid is, however, 
not commercially available. Its preparation has been 
taught, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,810,969 issued 
May 14, 1974 to A.A. Schlumberger. Schlumberger 
teaches a process for producing chloric acid by passing 
an aqueous solution containing from 0.2 gram mole to 11 
gram moles per liter of an alkali metal chlorate such 
as sodium chlorate through a selected cationic exchange 
resin at a temperature

wherein a source of the chlorate ions is a solution of chloric acid 

and a molar ratio of the perchlorate ions to the chlorate ions is at 
least 0.5:1, and wherein said catalyst contains a metal or 

metal oxide wherein the metal is cobalt, iridium, iron, nickel, 
palladium, platinum, osmium, rhodium, ruthenium, mixtures 

thereof or alloys thereof.
