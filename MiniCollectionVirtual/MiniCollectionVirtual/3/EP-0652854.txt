<ABSTRACT>
A piston rod (2) of a piston-cylinder unit (3) bears at the top a plunger die (not shown) of a glass moulding machine and is guided in a guide bush (22). The guide bush (22) is fitted in a magnetically conductive securing bush (20) of a securing flange (14). The securing bush (20) supports a coil (27) on its outside, the connecting leads (30) of which are taken outwards to a connector (37). Secured to the top of the piston (6) there is an inner flange (39) of a circular metal actuator (40). At the top end of the extrusion stroke of the piston (6), the actuator (40) enters an annular space (29) outside the coil (27) and thus alters its inductance.
