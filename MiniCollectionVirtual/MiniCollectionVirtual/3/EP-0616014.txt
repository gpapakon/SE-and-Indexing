atoms of the cyanine chromophore bear a carboxyalkyl 

substituent comprising an alkyl chain of at least five 
carbon atoms. The dyes are useful as sensitisers in 

photothermographic imaging materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of carboxyalkyl substituted 
heptamethine cyanine dyes as sensitisers in 
photothermographic imaging materials. The increasing availability and use of light 
emitting diodes based on laser or semiconductor light 
sources emitting in the near infrared (NIR) region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum has created the need for high 
quality photographic imaging materials which are 
sensitive to this region. For example, imaging materials 
sensitised to the red and NIR may be used to produce hard 
copy from computer stored graphics data using a scanning 
laser diode source. The wavelengths of interest are 
primarily in the region from 650 to 900nm, particularly 
650 to 850nm. Due to environmental concerns, the use of 
conventional silver halide materials which are processed 
by known 'wet' chemistries are being replaced by 'dry' 
processed materials. Wet processing produces waste 
materials which are becoming more difficult to dispose 
of, both commercially and environmentally. Dry processed 
materials do not suffer from these disposal 
considerations. Two main classes of dye have proven useful in the 
spectral sensitisation of photothermographic imaging 
materials; namely, merocyanine and cyanine dyes. 
Merocyanine dyes are often used to spectrally sensitise 
photothermographic materials to the visible part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum (400 to 650nm), but extending 
their absorption into the NIR region has proven  
 
difficult. Cyanine dyes have also been used to 
spectrally sensitise photothermographic materials to 
visible radiation. Although frequently subject to 
residual dye stain problems, as well as being inferior in 
overall performance to merocyanine dyes, cyanine dyes 
that absorb in the NIR region can be readily prepared. 
In particular, heptamethine cyanine dyes, in which the 
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic end groups are linked by 
a seven-carbon polymethine chain, are generally found to 
absorb in the near infrared. Many photothermographic imaging materials 
incorporate mercury and other heavy metal salts to enable 
an acceptable Dmin, a useful sensitivity (speed) 
(initially and after shelf storage of the coated 
material), as well as to reduce post processing print out 
in unexposed areas. Environmental concerns over the use of mercury and 
its salts and their subsequent disposal has necessitated 
the preparation of materials which do not incorporate any 
mercury species. Consequently, photothermographic 
materials must be constructed which overcome the
