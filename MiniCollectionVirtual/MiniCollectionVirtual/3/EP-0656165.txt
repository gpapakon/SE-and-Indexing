<ABSTRACT>
A surface-acoustical-wave (SAW) or other lumped intermediate-frequency amplifier filter is followed by an IF amplifier chain and a second detector constructed within the confines of a monolithic integrated circuit. The IF amplifier chain includes three emitter-coupled differential amplifiers, each exhibiting up to about twentyfold voltage gain, cascaded one after the other. Provision is made for automatically controlling the voltage gain of the first two emitter-coupled differential amplifiers. Common-collector amplifiers are used to buffer the application of the balanced output signals from each of the emitter-coupled differential amplifiers to the succeeding emitter-coupled differential amplifier or second detector (DET). Balanced current responses to the direct bias potentials on which the balanced signals supplied to the second detector are respectively superposed, are extracted by lowpass filtering (LPF) that is on-chip and does not use off-chip IF bypass capacitors. These balanced current responses are fed back to the emitters of the transistors in the common-collector amplifiers (Q68, Q69) used to couple the first gain-controlled emitter-coupled differential amplifier in the IF amplifier chain to the second gain-controlled emitter-coupled differential amplifier in the IF amplifier chain. This completes a direct-coupled feedback loop for degenerating the differences between the direct bias potentials on which the balanced signals supplied to the second detector are respectively superposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to intermediate-frequency (IF)
amplification and, more particularly, to intermediate-frequency
amplifier and second detector combinations as
constructed in monolithic-integrated-circuit form.Television receivers commonly use a type of monolithic
integrated-circuit, or IC, which is constructed using
bipolar transistors; is designed to follow a surface-acoustical-wave
(SAW) or other lumped "block" intermediate-frequency
amplifier filter; and comprises a cascade
connection of three emitter-coupled differential
amplifiers, each exhibiting up to about twentyfold voltage
gain, followed by a second detector. Untuned, direct
interstage coupling is provided by common-collector-amplifier
(or emitter-follower) transistors. Provision is
commonly made for automatically controlling the voltage
gain of the emitter-coupled differential amplifiers. The
second detector may be an envelope detector, but in recent
years is more often a synchronous detector or a quasi-synchronous
detector of the exalted-carrier type. In
double-conversion receivers or in an IF amplifier dedicated
to generating intercarrier sound, the second detector may
be a second mixer for converting a first intermediate
frequency to a second intermediate frequency.US-A-5 305 109, corresponding to EP-A-0 656 164 published 7 June
1995,
describes IF amplifier
circuitry modified by the inventor in making embodiments of 
the invention claimed hereinafter.
The IF amplifier circuitry
meets the automatic gain control range requirements of
about 66 dB for a television receiver IF amplifier chain to
be met by controlling the voltage gains of first and second
emitter-coupled differential amplifiers therein, and a
third emitter-coupled differential amplifier therein can be
operated with a fixed voltage gain.Commonly, second detectors are designed to be driven
with balanced signals from the IF amplifier chain. Then,
the desideratum is for reasonably good matching, at least
to within 20 millivolts or so, of the direct bias
potentials on which the balanced signals supplied to the
second detector are superposed. In previous designs
respective low-pass filters, each filter using an off-chip
capacitor, extract the direct bias potentials on which
these balanced signals supplied to the second detector are
superposed. The responses of these low-pass filters are
then differentially combined to develop an error signal fed
back to the input of the IF amplifier chain, thereby to
complete a direct-coupled (d-c) feedback loop for
degenerating the error signal.
