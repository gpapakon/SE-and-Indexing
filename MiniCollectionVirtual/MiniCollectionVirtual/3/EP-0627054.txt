<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to annular 
resilient seals such as used to prevent contaminants 
from entering into anti-friction bearings and 
particularly to a radially compressible hoop for 
providing radial support to such seals. In some steel-making facilities hot steel 
ingots are moved between one or more pairs of 
transversely extending rollers which work or shape 
the ingots to their finished thickness and 
sectional configuration. The individual rollers 
are spaced slightly apart on substantially  
 
horizontal axes extending transverse to the motion 
path of the ingots. Each roller is supported by a stub shaft at 
each of its opposite ends. Each stub shaft is 
supported in anti-friction bearings that are 
arranged in pillow block housings. The stub shaft 
may have a diameter of about nineteen inches (483 mm) in 
which case the axial length of the associated anti-friction 
bearing may be about thirteen inches (330 mm). 
Each bearing includes an inner race having a press-fit 
on its associated stub shaft. The outer race 
of each bearing is seated within an associated 
pillow block housing. Due to the large dimensions of the bearings, 
each bearing is usually divided into two annular 
half sections. Each half section is formed as an 
annulus about six and one-half inches (165 mm) long, and may 
contain two rows of anti-friction rollers. The 
bearing half sections are individually press fit 
axially onto the associated shaft in an end-to-end 
relationship. Due to the split or two-piece nature 
of the bearings, there is an annular joint formed 
between the abutting ends of the bearing half 
sections.  
 The annular interface between each stub shaft 
and the associated bearing inner race is sealed 
against entry of dirt by reason of the press fit 
between the shaft and inner race bore surface. 
Additional sealing is provided by a static annular 
seal which is located within an annular channel 
located at the annular abutment joint between the 
bearing half sections. It has been found that airborne dirt particles 
as well as dirt particles mixed with water can 
migrate through the press fit seal and through the 
backup seal during steel making operations. The 
migrating dirt can work itself into the interior 
spaces within the bearing to deposit on the roller 
bearing surfaces, thereby shortening the bearing 
service life by a grinding action on the roller 
surfaces. In order to provide for a more effective 
backup seal, a split resilient hoop had been 
considered to provide radial support for

<CLAIMS>
An annular seal assembly (31) comprising 
an annular sealing element (37) and an annular 

resilient reinforcement element (39); said 
reinforcement element (39) having a radial thickness 

dimension, an axial width dimension, and a 
circumferential dimension; said reinforcement 

element (39) having a circumferentially extending 
sinuous configuration (51,53) so that said 

reinforcement element (39) can expand or contract 
circumferentially without change in its radial 

thickness, characterized in that said reinforcement 
element (39) defines a flat axial section in contact 

with said sealing element (37) and wherein said 
reinforcement element (39) exerts substantially the same 

radial force on said sealing element (37) by 
circumferential deformation of said sinuous 

configuration(51, 53). 
The annular seal assembly (31) of claim 1, 
wherein said elastomeric sealing element (37) further 

comprises an inner annular surface, and a circumferential 
groove (41) in said inner annular 

surface; said annular reinforcement element (39) being  
 

seated within said groove (41) and trapped against axial 
displacement out of said sealing element (37). 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 1, wherein 
said reinforcement element (39) comprises a flat outer 

annular surface (47), a flat inner annular surface 
(49), and two side surfaces (51) interconnecting 

said outer and inner surfaces (47, 49); said reinforcement 
element (39) having regularly spaced slots (53) 

extending from one side surface part way toward the 
other side surface; said slots (53) being staggered so 

that successive slots extend from different ones of 
said side surfaces; said slots (53) extending from the 

outer annular surface (47) to the inner annular surface (49) 
of said reinforcement element (39) to give said 

reinforcement element said sinuous configuration (51, 53). 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 3, wherein 
each slot (53) extends from a side surface (51) of said 

reinforcement element (39) more than one half way across 
said reinforcement element (39). 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 4, wherein 
each slot (53) extends from a side surface (51) of said 

reinforcement element (39) approximately seventy five 
percent across said reinforcement element (39).  

 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 3, wherein 
spacing (57) between adjacent slots (53) is 

approximately equal to the width (55) of each slot (53). 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 3, wherein 
each slot (53) comprises a blind end surface (61) that 

is essentially semi-circular. 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 1, wherein 
said reinforcement element (39) is circumferentially 

compressed within said sealing element (37) so that the 
circumferential leng h of said compressed 

reinforcement element (39) is substantially less than 
the circumferential length of said reinforcement 

element (39) in its initial as-formed state. 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 8, wherein the 
change in circumferential length of the reinforcement 

element (39) due to its compression within the

said reinforcement element (39) is formed of spring 

steel.  
 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 8, wherein 
said reinforcement element (39) is formed from a flat 

steel band curled into a circular configuration 
with its ends welded together to form an endless

the radial thickness dimension of the circular 

steel band is appreciably less than the axial width 
dimension. 
The seal assembly (31) of claim 12, wherein 
the radial thickness dimension (47, 49) of the band is less

The seal assembly (31) of claim 12, wherein 
said steel band has flat side edges (51) thereof spaced 

apart to form the width dimension of the annular 
reinforcement element (39); said steel band having
