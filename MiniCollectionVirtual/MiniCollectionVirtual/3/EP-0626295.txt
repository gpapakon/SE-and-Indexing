<ABSTRACT>
A filter assembly (16) as well as a treatment system 
and an inflator module assembly (10) including such a 

filter assembly are provided. The filter assembly is 
mounted within the module diffuser housing (14) externally 

of the side or end (22) of an inflator (12) from which gas 
is emitted and is effective in the treatment of the gaseous 

emission. Such treatment can include the filtration of 
particulate from the gaseous
 emission as well as 
redirecting the flow of such emission in a desired manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable restraint 
systems and, more particularly, to improved treatment of the 
emission of an inflator of such an inflatable restraint system. Safety restraint systems which self-actuate from an undeployed 
to a deployed state without the need for intervention by the 
operator, i.e., "passive restraint systems", and particularly those 
restraint systems incorporating inflatable bags or cushions, as 
well as the use of such systems in motor vehicles have been the 
subjects of much discussion as the desirability of the use of such 
passive restraint systems has gained general acceptance in the 
United States. It is well known to protect a vehicle occupant using a cushion 
or bag that is inflated with gas, e.g., an "air bag", when the 
vehicle encounters sudden deceleration, such as in a collision. 
During deployment, the rapidly evolving gas with which the bag is 
typically filled is an inert gas, e.g., nitrogen. In such systems, 
the cushion is normally housed in an uninflated and folded 
condition to minimize space requirements. Upon actuation of the 
air bag system, gas is discharged from an inflator to rapidly 
inflate the bag. The cushion, upon inflation, serves to restrain 
the movement of the vehicle occupant as the collision proceeds. In 
general, such air bags are commonly designed to be inflated in no 
more than about 30-60 milliseconds. Vehicular inflatable restraint systems generally include 
multiple crash sensors generally positioned about or mounted to the 
frame and/or body of the subject vehicle and serve to sense sudden 
decelerations by the vehicle. In turn, the sensor sends a signal  
 
to an inflatable air bag/cushion module or assembly strategically 
positioned within the riding compartment of the vehicle to actuate 
deployment of the cushion. In general, an inflatable cushion 
provided for the protection of a vehicle driver, i.e., a driver 
side air bag, is mounted in a storage compartment located in the 
steering column of the vehicle. Whereas, an inflatable cushion for 
the protection of a front seat passenger, i.e., a passenger side 
air bag, is typically mounted in the instrument panel/dash board of 
the vehicle. Typical inflatable cushion restraint systems make use of an 
air bag module which generally includes an outer reaction housing 
or canister, commonly referred to as a "reaction can" or, more 
briefly, as a "can". The reaction canister generally serves to 
support or contain other components of the air bag module system, 
including
