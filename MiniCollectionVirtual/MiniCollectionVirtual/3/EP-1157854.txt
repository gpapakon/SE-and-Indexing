<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a presensitized plate, having intermediate
and photosensitive layers sequentially provided on a support

for a lithographic printing plate, which is provided by
subjecting an aluminum plate to graining, alkali etching and

anodizing treatments. The amount of alkali etching is set in
a range of 0.5 to 4 g/m

 for the alkali etching treatment, and
an average thickness of thinnest 10% of the photosensitive layer

on convex portions of a surface of the support is set in a range
of 0.2 to 2 µm. This presensitized plate has wide deve
lopment
latitude, makes it difficult for scratch-like non-image

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support for a
lithographic printing plate and a presensitized plate,
particularly to a positive working presensitized plate
having a photosensitive layer that can become alkali-soluble
by photothermal conversion with laser beams and a
support for a lithographic printing plate used for the
positive working presensitized plate.Lithographic printing is a printing method using the
property that water and oil are immiscible. On the
printing surface of the lithographic printing plate used
for the method, areas (hereunder referred to as non-image
areas) that accept water and repel oil ink and areas
(hereunder referred to as image areas) that repel water and
accept oil ink are formed. The support for a lithographic printing plate, which
is used so as to carry the non-image areas of the surface,
requires various properties such as water wettability and
water receptivity, and further good adhesion to a
photosensitive layer provided thereon, which are
incompatible.When the water wettability of the support is too low,
ink attaches on the non-image areas during printing and a
stain is generated on a blanket cylinder, then a so-called
scum develops on a print. When the water receptivity of
the support is too low, much fountain solution is needed to
prevent clogging on shadow areas during printing.
Therefore, a so-called water range becomes narrow.Recent years, accompanied with development of image
formation technology, it has come to be possible to make a
printing plate directly by scanning narrow focused laser
beams on the printing plate and by forming a manuscript of
letters, images and the like directly on the plate without
using a film manuscript.For example, in the case of a so-called thermal 
positive working type presensitized plate in which a
positive image is formed by making a photosensitive layer
alkali-soluble by photothermal conversion in the photo
sensitive layer, heat generated from photothermal
conversion materials in the photosensitive layer by
applying laser beams induces image forming reaction.Here, when a deep pit generated by graining treatment
exists on the surface of support treated for graining,
thickness of the portion of the photosensitive layer
becomes thicker, and image forming reaction on the bottom
of the pit becomes inadequate. As a result, local residual
layers (hereunder referred to also as dot residual layers)
are generated on the non-image areas, causing a problem of
scum developing on the non-image areas during printing.Moreover, the amount of the
