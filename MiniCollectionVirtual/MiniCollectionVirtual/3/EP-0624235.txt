<ABSTRACT>
A cassette type gas cylinder, containing liquefied fuel gas, for giving an alarm when the volume of remaining fuel is reduced to a predetermined level or less in order to provide an advanced notice of replacement of the gas cylinder with a simple structure using burst energy of discharged gas. A valve (12) for opening and closing the discharged of liquefied gas is arranged at the centre on one end of a container body (11a). A gas flow channel (17), with one end thereof opened into a gas space formed above the level of the fuel when the gas cylinder is laid horizontally, is connected to the valve (12). A vibrating member (27), for producing a sound when vibrated and caused to collide with a body by the burst of the fuel gas, is disposed in the gas flow channel (17). This vibrating member (27) is connected to a damping member (38) by means of a coupling member (29). The damping member (38) is located below a predetermined level of the liquefied fuel gas, and is subjected to resistance while moving in the liquefied fuel gas. The damping member (38) suppresses the production of a collision sound made by the vibrating member (27) by providing the vibrating member (27) with resistance when the level of the liquefied fuel is above the predetermined level, but does not suppress the production of the collision sound when the level of the liquefied fuel is below the predetermined level, thereby giving an alarm indicating the reduction of remaining fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a remaining volume 
alarm unit for use with a cassette type cylinder 
containing liquefied fuel gas according to the 
pre-characterizing part of claim 1. Portable heaters are heretofore widely known 
wherein combustion is effected by gas supplied from a 
cassette gas cylinder set into a portable heater containing 
liquefied fuel gas instead of gas supplied through a gas 
hose connected to a gas outlet of town gas. This cassette 
type gas cylinder is used with portable heaters and stoves 
for outdoor activity purposes or with other types of gas 
apparatuses. The above-mentioned cassette type gas cylinder is 
provided with a cylindrical container body, and a valve for 
opening and closing the discharge of liquefied gas 
contained in the container. This container is set into a 
gas apparatus while being laid. A nick-shaped indentation 
which engages with a corresponding protuberance of the gas 
apparatus is formed on the end of the container so that a  
 
definite position of the container can be directed to the 
upper side. A gas flow guide channel extends from the 
inner end of the valve into an upper space inside the 
container body defined when the container is positioned 
horizontally, and the upper end of the channel is open in 
the upper space. This ensures that vaporized gas is 
constantly given off from a gas space, which in turn 
prevents the supply of liquefied fuel as it is. However, in the case of the gas cylinder of the 
above-mentioned type, it is difficult to know the volume of 
remaining gas from the outside when the amount of liquefied 
fuel gas contained is reduced as a result of its use. 
Also, a gas spray velocity tends to drop sharply, and hence 
there is a fear of unforeseeable consumption of fuel which 
causes the gas to be extinguished. In other words, the volume of the remaining fuel of 
the cassette gas cylinder can be definitely ascertained by 
removably swinging the container away from the gas 
apparatus. Accordingly, an opportunity for replacing the 
gas cylinder with a new one is difficult to realize while 
the gas cyiinder is set in the gas apparatus, and the fuel 
may come to an end without the preparation of a spare gas 
cylinder. Hence, there is a demand for an alarm which is 
sounded when the volume of the remaining fuel is reduced to 
a nominal amount. US-A-3,640,241 discloses a remaining 
volume alarm unit having the features 
of the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. 
The valve is held in an opened position 
by means of a weight acting upon

<CLAIMS>
A remaining volume alarm unit for use with a cassette type gas 
cylinder (10) containing liquefied fuel gas (F), said alarm unit (20) 

comprising: 

a gas flow channel means (17) with one end thereof connected to the 
inner end of a valve (12) of said cyiinder and with the other end thereof 

opened into a gas space formed above level of the fuel (F) when said 
gas cylinder (10) is laid horizontally; and 
a movable vibrating member (27) disposed in said gas flow channel 
means (17) for producing a sound when vibrated and caused to collide 

with a body by the burst of the fuel gas; characterized by 
a damping means (38) connected to said vibrating member (27) by 
means of a coupling member (29), and located below a predetermined 

level of the liquefied fuel gas (F), whereby said damping means (38) 
suppresses the production of a collision sound made by said vibrating 

member (27) by providing the vibrating member (27) with resistance 
when the level of the liquefied fuel (F) is above said predetermined 

level, but does not suppress the production of the collision sound when 
the level of the liquefied fuel is below said predetermined level. 
An alarm unit as defined in claim 1, further comprising: 

a casing (21) connected to said gas flow channel menas (17); and 
a cylinder (24) having a connecting hole (25) arranged inside said 
casing, in which said vibrating member (27) is slidably fitted in said 

cylinder (24) with one end surface of said vibrating member (27) being 
subjected to an internal gas pressure of said container;  

 
said connecting hole (25) formed so as to be closed by said vibrating 
member (27) when said vibrating member (27) is situated at a descended 

position; 
whereby the movement of said vibrating member (27) is brought 
about by the increase of a difference between pressures acting on both 

sides of said vibrating member (27) when said connecting hole (25) is 
closed in response to a pressure drop occuring in said gas flow channel 

means (17) resulting from the opening of said valve (12), and the speed 
of movement of said vibrating member (27) depends on the position of 

said damping means (38) with respect to said predetermined level. 
An alarm unit as defined in claim 2, wherein said vibrating means 
(27) is in the form of a piston. 
An alarm unit as defined in any of claims 1 to 3, further comprising: 

a resilient member (31) for supporting the weight of said vibrating 
member (27) when said gas flow channel means (17) is disconnected 

from an internal space of said cylinder (24) by said vibrating member 
(27); and 
a port which opens when said vibrating member (27) is moved displacing 
said resilient member (31), and then said gas flow channel 

means (17) is connected with the internal space of said cylinder (24). 
A cassette type gas cylinder including the alarm unit of claim 1, 
comprising: 


a container (11), for containing liquefied fuel gas (F), which is made 
up of a cylindrical container body (11a), an annular top (11b) to be 

joined to one end of said container body (11a) and a lid (13) to be 
joined to the center aperture of said top (11b);  

 
said valve (12) being fixed to the center of said lid (13) for controlling 
the discharge of the liquefied fuel gas (F); 
said gas flow channel (17) with one end thereof insertably fitted into 
the inner end of said valve (12) in the axial direction and with the other 

end thereof extended upward into the gas space; 
a casing (21) connected to the end of said gas flow channel (17) for 
housing the remaining volume alarm unit (20) the outer surface of said 

casing (21) being cylindrically shaped so as to be fitted along the inner 
surface of said container body (11a) and also joined to a radially extended 

supporting member (22, 22'); 
said supporting member (22, 22') for fixedly placing said casing (21) 
to which said gas flow channel (17) is firmly attached in position inside 

said container body, wherein the inner end of said valve is fitted to the 
end of said gas flow channel (17) after said container body (11a) is 

joined to said top (11b) but before said lid (13) is attached to said top. 
A cassette type gas cylinder as defined in claim 4 or 5, wherein 
said resilient member is made up of a coil spring (31) sandwiched between 

said vibrating member and a bottom of said casing (21).
