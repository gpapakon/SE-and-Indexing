<ABSTRACT>
A propellant gas sealing device for artillery shells comprising a projectile and a propellant charge, including a piston (10) attached to the back of the projectile by a separable connector (12) to separate the projectile from the explosive charge, a low pressure seal (14) supported by the piston for sealing the piston from the weapon chamber, and a high pressure plug (17) supported by the piston (10) for sealing the piston from the weapon barrel. The device is suitable for shells in which the propellant charge is separate from the projectile.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing device for the propellant gases of a
piece of artillery ammunition (6) incorporating a

projectile (7), a propellant charge (8), and a piston (10)
fastened to the rear of the projectile by a removable

connecting device (12), 
characterized in that
 it
comprises:


low pressure packing ring (14) carried by the piston
and intended to provide gas-tighting between the piston

and the weapon chamber (2),
and a high pressure obturator (17) carried by the
piston (10) and intended to provide gas-tightness between

the piston and the weapon barrel.
A device according to Claim 1 characterized in that
the packing ring (14) is positioned to the rear of the

piston and behind the obturator (17).
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the piston (10) carries a removable connecting device

(12) comprising delayed operation separating means, which
can be automatic or controlled.
A device according to Claims 1 or 3, characterized
in that the piston carries a pressure-sensitive trigger

(13) designed to control, in a delayed manner, the
separation of the projectile from the piston.
A device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the piston carries means controlling the delayed

ignition of an additional propellant charge integral with
the projectile.
A device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the packing ring (14) has at least one flexible lip

whose diameter, in its initial position, is greater than
that of the loading chamber (2) into which the projectile

must be loaded.
