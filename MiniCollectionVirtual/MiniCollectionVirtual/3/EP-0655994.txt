<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new process to an optically active aminodiol which may 
be used to prepare chiral carbocyclic analogues of nucleosides. During the past two decades much attention has been given to the synthesis and 
biological studies of carbocyclic analogues of nucleosides. Recently, a number of 
approaches have appeared in the literature for the preparation of enantiomerically 
pure carba-2'-deoxyribonucleosides, for example chemoenzymatically, by 
asymmetric synthesis and by chromatographic and enzymatic resolution. A key 
synthetic precursor of the carbocyclic analogues of 2'-deoxyribonucleosides is 
[1S(1α, 2β, 4β)]-4-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1-cyclopentanol, a compound of formula 
(I) below first described by L Ötvös et al in Tetrahedron Letters, 28 (50), 6381-6384, 
1987. 
This paper described the preparation of the compound of formula (I) from an 
unsaturated bicyclic lactone, (+)-(1R,5S)-2-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-6-en-3-one. The 
authors subsequently reported in Tetrahedron, 44(19), 6207-6216, 1988 an 
improved procedure from a bicyclic lactone diol. We now describe herein a novel alternative procedure for the preparation of the 
compound of formula (I). Thus, according to one aspect of this invention, there is 
provided a multistep process for preparing the compound of formula (I) as depicted 
in Scheme 1 hereinafter.  
 
 
wherein R represents a suitable protecting group. 
Step a  for the preparation of the compound of formula (V) from the compound of 
formula (VI) comprises treating (VI) with a suitable base such as an organic amine 
[e.g. 1,5-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-5-ene (DBU)]. The reaction may conveniently be 
effected in an organic solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. 
dichloromethane) at an elevated temperature (e.g. reflux).  Step b  for the preparation of the compound of formula (IV) from the compound of 
formula (V) comprises treating (V) with a Lewis acid such as aluminium trichloride, 
zinc chloride, titanium tetrachloride or boron trifluoride etherate in a solvent such 
as a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane) conveniently in admixture 
with a hydrocarbon solvent (e.g. toluene) at about room temperature, followed by 
reduction with a suitable hydride reducing agent, for example an aluminium hydride 
reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL). The DIBAL may 
conveniently be added as a solution in a hydrocarbon solvent (e.g. toluene) and 
the reduction carried out at a reduced temperature (e.g. at about 0° to 10°C). The 
reaction may be
