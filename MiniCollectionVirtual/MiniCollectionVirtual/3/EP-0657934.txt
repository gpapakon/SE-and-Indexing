<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor integrated circuit adaptable to any logic circuits using a common mask with the exception of a mask of 
metallic wirings so as to drastically improve performance of custom LSIs. The semiconductor integrated circuit comprises a logic 

circuit having a plurality of input terminals and at least one output terminal. The logic circuit includes a plurality of circuit blocks 

of the same circuit construction. Each of the circuit blocks has at least two stages of inverter formed by MOS semiconductor devices 
and at least one layer of a wiring pattern having a different pattern. The output signal of each block is defined by a predetermined 

function of an input signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated 
circuit, and in particular, provides novel custom LSIs capable of 
realizing a variety of logical functions using essentially 
identical circuit patterns. The degree of integration of semiconductor integrated 
circuits has increased year by year in concert with development in 
the miniaturization of transistors. As the degree of integration 
has increased, the logical LSI functions realizable on one chip 
have increased dramatically. As a result, 32 and 64 bit microprocessors have been 
developed and installed in industrial and consumer apparatuses, 
and an extremely high degree of control has been conducted. 
However, the method in which predetermined control is conducted by 
programming general purpose chips such as microprocessors in 
accordance with the respective purpose has the drawback that, in 
general, processing speed is reduced. Specialized LSI chips which are developed so as to conform to 
specific applications and which are incorporated into the 
appropriate systems, that is to say, the so-called custom LSIs,  
 
have thus increased in importance; however, it is currently the 
case that an enormous amount of time and cost is associated with 
the development of specialized chips, and such development is 
incapable of meeting the needs of a rapidly developing world. Furthermore, in semiconductor manufacturing facilities which 
produce chips, in order to produce a variety of custom LSIs, it is 
necessary to store a large number of LSI pattern originals (termed 
reticles), and to conduct the manufacturing of LSIs by, where 
necessary, setting these in a stepper (a pattern projection 
transfer apparatus); this causes problems such as a marked 
decrease in manufacturing efficiency, in particular in view of the 
time required for the changing of the reticles. Accordingly, the development of technology by which a variety 
of custom LSIs can be produced using, in so far as possible, 
identical reticles, has been desired. An example of technology meeting these requirements is the 
gate array. A gate array is constructed by arranging a plurality 
of identical circuit blocks, wherein two NMOS and PMOS transistors 
are formed into a group, on a chip. The necessary logical 
function is then realized by appropriately connecting these 
transistors by means of a conductive wiring pattern such as Al or 
the like. This technology is capable of forming simple circuits, 
such as AND, NAND, OR, and NOR circuits, comparatively easily; 
however, if an
