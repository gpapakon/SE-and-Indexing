Powder inhaler for the inhalation of therapeutically
active powders from the surface of flat carriers (1)

wherein the inhaler comprises a flat carrier (1) with
regularly arranged microstructures (3) and with a device

(4,5,6,7,8,9,10) for generating a blast of air by means of
which a dose of the powder between the regularly arranged

microstructures (3) of a carrier (1) is blown out and
converted into an aerosol which is mixed with the

patient's breath immediately or after storage in an
intermediate container, characterised in that the

microstructures (3) are knob-like elevations which project
above the surface of the carrier holding the powder and

have a height in the range from 10 to 500 µm, said
microstructures (3) not being fibres arranged in the

manner of velvet or velours.
Powder inhaler according to claim 1, characterised in
that the height of the microstructures (3) is in the range

from 50 to 200 µm.
Powder inhaler according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the carrier (1) is in the form of a

belt, plate or disc.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the microstructures (3) are

circular, elliptical, polygonal, Y-shaped or cross-shaped
in cross-section or have a cross-section which is a

combination of such shapes.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the axes of the microstructures (3)

directed towards the plane of the carrier are 
perpendicular thereto or form an angle of 
<
 90° therewith.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the microstructures (3) are

cylindrical, prismatic, conical or frustoconical, or in
the form of pyramids or truncated pyramids.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the diameter or the corresponding

dimensions of the microstructures, in the case of a non-circular
cross-section, are between about 10 and 500 µm,

preferably between 30 and 100 µm.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the spacing between the

microstructures (3) is between about 10 and 500 µm,
preferably between 30 and 100 µm.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the ratio of free volume between the

microstructures (3) to the total space filled with
microstructures is from 10 to 98%, preferably from 50 to

80%.
Powder inhaler according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the carrier (1) consists of flexible

or rigid material.
Powder inhaler according to claim 10, characterised
in that the carrier (1) takes the form of a rigid or stiff

circular disc on which the individual doses of the powder
for inhalation are arranged in sectors, the individual

sectors being separated from one another, if desired, by
means of partition walls.
