Compositions intended for the surface treatment of 
papers and cardboards characterized in that they contain, in 

aqueous solution, a mixture constituted by glyoxal (G), urea 
(U), and an alkali metal salt of an oxygenated boron acid and 

that the pH of said compositions is adjusted to a pH of less 
than 6 using an alkaline-earth metal hydroxide. 
Compositions according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the alkali metal salt of an oxygenated boron acid is disodium 

tetraborate crystallized with 10 molecules of water, 
designated hereafter A. 
Compositions according to claim 2, characterized in that 
they contain in aqueous solution, a mixture of glyoxal (G), 

urea (U) and disodium tetraborate crystallized with 10 
molecules of water (A) in the following molar ratios: 


0.1 ≤ 
U
G
 ≤ 2 
0.01 ≤ 
A
G
 ≤ 0.5 
 
and that the pH of said compositions is adjusted to a pH of 

less than 6 with calcium hydroxide. 
Compositions according to claim 3, characterized in that 
they contain in aqueous solution between about 10% and about 

60% by weight of a mixture of glyoxal, urea, sodium 
tetraborate crystallized with 10 molecules of water and 

calcium hydroxide. 
Compositions according to claim 4, characterized in that 
they contain in aqueous solution 40 ± 5% of a mixture 

containing on the one hand, per 1 mole of glyoxal, 0.1 to 0.5 
mole of urea, 0.01 to 0.2 mole of disodium tetraborate 

crystallized with 10 molecules of water and a quantity of 
calcium hydroxide. 
Compositions according to claim 5, characterized in that  
 

the molar ratio of calcium hydroxide (D) to disodium 
tetraborate crystallized with 10 molecules of water (A) 

complies with the following relationship: 

0.1 ≤ 
D
A
 ≤ 1.3 
Coating baths for papers and cardboards based on mineral 
pigments and binders characterized in that they contain a 

composition according to any one of claims 1 to 6. 
Papers having an improved resistance to abrasion whilst 
moist characterized in that they have been treated with a 

coating bath according to claim 7. 
Use for the surface treatment of papers or cardboards of 
a composition as defined in one of claims 1 to 6, in a 

coating bath for papers and cardboards based on mineral 
pigments and binders.
