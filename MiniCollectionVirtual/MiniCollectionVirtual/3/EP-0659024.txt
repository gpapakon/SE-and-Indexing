<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an illumination system (7) for a colour image 
projection device (1). The illumination system (7) comprises a radiation source (3) for 

generating an unpolarized radiation beam (5) and at least a cholesteric mirror (9, 10, 
11, 12, 13, 14) for wavelength-selective splitting of the radiation beam (5) into at least 

two sub-beams of different wavelengths. A composite circular polarizer (35) for directly 
converting the unpolarized radiation beam (5) into circularly polarized sub-beams jointly 

forming one beam is arranged in the path of the unpolarized radiation beam (5) between 
the radiation source (3) and the cholesteric mirror (9). The composite circular polarizer 

(35) comprises a polarization-sensitive beam splitter (43) which splits the unpolarized 
radiation beam (5) into two mutually perpendicularly and linearly polarized sub-beams, 

and a polarization converter (51, 53; 59, 61). The circularly polarized monochrome 
sub-beams are subsequently modulated, either or not after passage through a λ/4 plate 

(63, 65, 67), by a corresponding number of image display panels (27, 29, 31) and 
projected as an image 
via
 a projection lens system (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an illumination system for a colour image
projection device, successively comprising a radiation source for supplying an unpolarized radiation
beam and at least one cholesteric mirror for splitting the radiation beam into at least two
sub-beams having a different wavelength.The invention further relates to a colour image projection device
comprising such an illumination system and a circular polarizer.The term colour image projection device should be considered to have a
wide meaning and may be used for a device for displaying a video image, a graphic
image, numerical information or a combination thereof.An illumination system suitable for use in a colour image projection
device of the type described in the opening paragraph is known from the article "New
Liquid Crystal Polarized Color Projection Principle" by M. Schadt and J. Fünfschilling
in Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 29, no. 10, October 1990, pp. 1974-1984.
The image display panels of the illumination system used in the known device are
transmission panels having a layer of liquid crystalline material as an image-forming
element. This layer modulates the state of polarization of incident radiation in
conformity with the image information present therein. To this end the beam supplied
by the illumination system should be linearly polarized in a given direction or should
have a given direction of polarization rotation, dependent on whether the image display
panel is suitable for modulating linearly or circularly polarized radiation. An image
display panel is herein understood to mean the combination of the liquid crystalline
layer with a polarizer and an analyser.The illumination system described in the article makes use of cholesteric
mirrors for splitting the "white" unpolarized radiation beam emitted by the radiation 
source into a plurality of "coloured" sub-beams in conformity with the number of image
display panels and in a defined state of polarization. Thus, the cholesteric mirrors have
a dual function, viz. colour selection and polarization selection.A cholesteric mirror has an optical layer of liquid crystalline material with
a spiral or helix-like structure having a pitch p. When a "white", unpolarized radiation
beam is incident on such a mirror, a circularly polarized radiation component having a
direction of rotation corresponding to the direction of rotation of the molecular helix
and a wavelength adapted to the pitch p of the helix will be reflected, while a
component having the opposite direction
