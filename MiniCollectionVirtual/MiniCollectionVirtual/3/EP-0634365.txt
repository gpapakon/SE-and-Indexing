<ABSTRACT>
A process for breaking down aromatics in industrial 
wastewaters that contain small amounts of aromatics by reaction 

with an ozone-containing oxygen stream at a temperature of from 40 
to 70°C and at a pH of from 4 to 7, involves treating industrial 

wastewaters that contain small amounts of aromatics in two stages 
with an oxygen stream that contains from 5 to 8% by volume of ozone 

with thorough mixing by causing the wastewater to flow upward 
through two reaction zones, the overflow of the wastewater at the 

top of the first reaction zone entering the second reaction zone at 

the base, the purified wastewater being obtained at the top of the 
second reaction zone, the ozone-containing oxygen stream first 

entering at the base of the second reaction zone, and the waste gas 
obtained at the top of the second reactor being introduced at the 

base of the first reaction zone, and, furthermore, a gas containing 
less than 0.2% by volume of ozone being obtained at the top of the 

first reaction zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for breaking
down aromatics in industrial wastewaters that contain small amounts
of organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds by reaction with an
ozone-containing oxygen stream at from about 40 to 70°C and at a pH
of from about 4 to 7.It is known from EP-A-378 994 that nitrobenzene synthesis
wastewaters, which contain various aromatic compounds, in
particular nitrophenols, can be purified solely by treatment with
ozone at from 20 to 100°C, a pressure of from 1.5 to 10 bar and a
pH of from 3 to 12, essentially from 7 to 9, to such an extent that
the levels of the original impurities are lowered to below their
detection limits.However, this method is not entirely satisfactory, since
the ozone consumption is still relatively high and consequently,
because of the high energy requirements of ozone generation, the
costs are too high; that is, some of the ozone decomposes without
contributing to the breaking down of the aromatics.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
process which will maximize the proportion of ozone that
contributes to breaking down the organic and inorganic nitrogen-based
compounds.It has been found, surprisingly, that this object is
achieved in that combination of the following measures leads to an
appreciably improved utilization of the ozone used:
a) industrial wastewaters that contain small amounts of aromaticsb) are treated in two stages with an oxygen stream that contains
from about 5 to 8% by volume of ozone with thorough mixing by
causing the wastewater to flow upward through two reaction
zones, the overflow of the wastewater at the top of the first
reaction zone entering the second reaction zone at the base, the
purified wastewater being obtained at the top of the second
reaction zone, the ozone-containing oxygen stream first entering at
the base of the second reaction zone, and the waste gas obtained at
the top of the second reactor being introduced at the base of the
first reaction zone, and, furthermore, a gas containing less than
about 0.2% by volume of ozone being at the top of the first
reaction zone;c) the breaking down is carried out in both the reaction zones at
from about 40 to 70°C;d) the reaction is carried out essentially under atmospheric
pressure;e) the wastewater is introduced at the base of the first reaction
zone with a pH of from about 4 to 7 and at the base of the
second reaction zone with a pH that is lower by from about 2
to 3 units, or the wastewater is continuously operated between
a pH of from about

about 40 to 70°C and at a pH of from about 4 to 7, comprising the

treatment of said wastewaters in two stages with said ozone-containing
oxygen stream, by causing said wastewater to flow upward

through two reaction zones such that the overflow of said
