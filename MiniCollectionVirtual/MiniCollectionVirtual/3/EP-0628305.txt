<ABSTRACT>
This composition contains:   (a) from 15 to 50% by weight of at least one vegetable oil consisting of at least 40% of linoleic (linolic) acid triglycerides, (b) from 2 to 7% by weight of a self-emulsifiable composition comprising from 60 to 90% by weight of at least one fatty alcohol having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, from 10 to 40% by weight of at least one alkylpolysaccharide (alkylpolyglycoside), in which the alkyl chain has from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, and from 0 to 5% by weight of polysaccharide (polyglycoside), (c) from 0.5 to 5% by weight of a coemulsifier chosen from at least one saturated fatty alcohol having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms, a saturated fatty acid having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms and their mixtures,   (d) from 0.1 to 1% by weight of a gelling agent, and  the remainder consisting essentially of an aqueous phase. This composition can be provided in the form of a cream, milk or mask or alternatively in the form of a foundation cream.

Cosmetic or dermatological composition in the 
form of a stable oil-in-water emulsion, characterized in 

that it contains: 

(a) from 15 to 50% by weight of at least one 
vegetable oil consisting of at least 40% linoleic acid 

triglycerides, 
(b) from 2 to 7% by weight of a self-emulsifiable 
composition comprising from 60 to 90% by weight of at 

least one fatty alcohol having from 12 to 22 carbon 
atoms, from 10 to 40% by weight of at least one alkylpolysaccharide 

whose alkyl chain has from 12 to 22 carbon 
atoms, and from 0 to 5% by weight of polysaccharide, 
(c) from 0.5 to 5% by weight of a coemulsifying 
agent chosen from at least one saturated fatty alcohol 

having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms, a saturated fatty acid 
having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms and their mixtures, 
(d) from 0.1 to 1% by weight of a gelling agent, 
and
 
the remainder consisting essentially of an aqueous phase.

claims, characterized in that the self-emulsifiable 

composition is present in a proportion of between 2 and 
6% by weight with respect to the total weight of the 

emulsion.
