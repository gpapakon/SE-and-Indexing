<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic film 
scanners and more particularly to apparatus utilizing 
solid-state image scanning devices, such as linear 
array charge coupled devices (CCD), as a virtual 
contact scanner whereby image pixel information is 
sensed without the use of focussing optics between the 
film and the solid state scanning device. The use of solid state scanners in photographic 
film scanning apparatus is well known. For example, in 
the CLAS 35 manufactured and sold by Eastman Kodak 
Company, assignee of the present application, color 
exposure analysis of film images is performed at a 
scanner station in which light transmitted through a 
film strip is focussed onto a linear CCD array by means 
of optical lenses. The CLAS 35 is a large scale, high 
speed photographic printer in which the space between 
the film and the CCD scanner device that is required to 
accommodate an optical focussing lens system is not of 
particular concern. In copending commonly assigned 
application Serial No. 618,532 - Bender et al, filed 
November 26, 1990, entitled "Exposure Determining Color 
Film Scanning Apparatus for a Photofinishing System" a 
solid state scanner is disclosed in which the optical 
lens system is eliminated and the solid state CCD 
scanning device is maintained in virtual contact with 
the film as the film passes through the scanner film 
gate. By "virtual contact" is meant that the CCD 
photosites of the scanner are nearly in contact but may 
be spaced fractionally away from the film image by the  
 
housing in which the CCD photosites are enclosed and to 
avoid physical contact that might damage the film 
and/or the CCD scanner device. The result of employing 
virtual contact scanning is a much smaller system 
suitable for small photographic printers of the minilab 
and desktop variety. A concern with the design of a virtual contact 
scanner of the type described in the above Bender et al 
application is the need to establish and maintain 
precise spacing of the CCD arrays from the film image 
plane. It is typical to mount CCD devices on a printed 
wiring board which includes the scan control and 
readout circuits needed to operate the CCD. This 
requires close control of the manufacturing tolerances 
on the printed wiring board which is costly and not 
practical for this application. Additionally, repair 
and replacement of board mounted scanners can be a 
problem in terms of maintaining a precise repeatable 
spacing relationship of the scanner device to the film 
image plane. It

<CLAIMS>
Film gate apparatus for a color film virtual 
contact scanner in which a plurality of scanning 

arrays, each associated with a selected color to be 
scanned, are spaced a predetermined distance from a 

film image plane to respond directly to discrete pixels 
in the film image without interposition of focussing 

optics, the film gate apparatus comprising: 

a generally planar film gate base having a film 
track on one side with a film gate opening defining a 

film image plane and on the other side, a site for 
receiving a scanner assembly, and having a scanning 

aperture between the receiving site and the film gate 
opening; 
a solid-state scanner assembly including a 
substrate and an array of solid-state image pixel 

sensors, the sensor array being mounted on the 
substrate, said substrate being positioned on said 

receiving site with said sensor array positioned within 
said scanning aperture at said predetermined distance 

from the film image plane, the scanner assembly also 
including sensor array electrical terminals accessible 

on the opposite side of the substrate from the sensor 
array; 
a printed circuit board carrying sensor array 
control circuits and being positioned adjacent the 

terminal-accessible side of said substrate, said 
circuit board having control circuit contact terminals 

aligned with the sensor array electrical terminals; 
and clamping means operative to hold the scanner 
assembly and printed circuit board in place on the film 

gate base with the contact terminals of the circuit 
board in electrical contact with the sensor array 

electrical terminals. 
The film gate apparatus of claim 1 wherein 
said scanner assembly receiving site is comprised of a 

recess with upstanding sides, at least one of which 
forms a reference position stop, said scanner substrate 

is positioned within said recess and the film gate 
apparatus further includes spring means for urging said 

scanner substrate against said reference position stop. 
The film gate apparatus of claim 2 wherein 
said recess includes a pair of mutually orthogonal 

sides forming a right angle position stop, said scanner 
substrate is rectangular in shape, and said spring 

means includes a pair of spring fingers engaging 
orthogonal edges of the scanner substrate to urge the 

substrate against the right angle position stop of the 
recess. 
The film gate apparatus of claim 1 wherein 
said scanner substrate includes apertures aligned with 

said sensor array electrical terminals through which 
the sensor terminals are accessible, and the film gate 

apparatus further includes compressible electrically 
conductive pads positioned in the substrate apertures 

to provide electrical contact between the sensor 
terminals and the contact terminals of the printed 

circuit board. 
The film gate apparatus of claim 4 wherein 
said compressible pads also comprise compression means 

holding the scanner assembly substrate in position 
against the film gate base. 
The film gate apparatus of claim 5 wherein 
said clamping means comprises a pressure plate which  

 
spans the printed circuit board and is affixed to the 

film gate base on opposite sides of the board, the 
pressure plate further including raised segments 

abutting the printed circuit board in alignment with 
said compressible pads. 
The film gate apparatus of claim 6 wherein 
said raised segments of the pressure plate comprise the 

sole points of clamping pressure against the printed 
wiring board.
