<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at reading optical information formed on a specular surface having a high intensity of reflected light 
of a specular reflection component. Part of the light radiated through a lens is diffused and reflected on a diffusing reflector, and 

it reaches an image sensor. When a bar code reader is inclined at a predetermined angle, the first radiated light out of the first 
and second radiated light does not reach the image sensor, but part of the diffused reflected light is reflected on a specular surface 

and introduced to the image sensor along the above-mentioned optical path. This enables even a bar code formed on a specular 
surface to be read by a regular reading operation in which such a bar code is read by a bar code reader disposed with its read 

port in contact with the specular surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
reading apparatus, and more specifically to an apparatus for
reading optical information (bar codes, optical characters
etc.) provided on a specular or mirror surface (like metal
surface).Conventionally, a bar code reader for POS (Point of
Sales) system reads bar code by the following method.A bar code consisting of black bars 20 and white
spaces 21, printed on paper as shown in enlarged section along
the scanning direction in attached Fig. 7, is irradiated by
light beams 200 from a light source (not shown).The light beam 200 incident to the bar 20 is reflected
and diffused on the surface of the bar 20. The surface of
the bar 20, in case of in black color, provides a low reflectance.
Consequently, the luminous intensity of light reflected
on the bar surface to form an image in an image sensor or
photoelectric conversion device (such as CCD) is extremely
low.Meanwhile, the light beam 200 incident to the space
21 is also reflected and diffused on the space surface in the 
same manner as in the black bar 20. Since the surface of the
white space 21 provides a high reflectance, the luminous
intensity of light (reflected light beam 201) reflected on the
space surface to form an image in the image sensor is higher
than that of the reflected light from the surface of the bar
20. Thus, the bar code reader identifies bars 20 and spaces 21
based on the difference in the luminous intensity of reflected
light beams received by the image sensor, thereby reading bar
code information.Further, the conventional bar code reader for
performing the above-described operation is designed to
overcome the following drawback.When the bar code surface is covered with colorless,
transparent laminate or vinyl film, and when the reflection
light beam from the bar code surface to form an image in the
image sensor is a regular or mirror reflection component, the
bar code reader cannot read information, due to halation in
the image sensor caused by the excessively high luminous
intensity of the reflected light beam.This problem has been solved in the conventional bar
code reader by designing a housing shape of the bar code
reader and the internal optical system layout appropriately,
so that an optical image is formed in the image sensor not by
a regular reflection component but by a diffusion reflection
component. As a result, the conventional bar code reader can
read bar code information by the aforementioned method even
when the bar code surface is covered with colorless, transparent
