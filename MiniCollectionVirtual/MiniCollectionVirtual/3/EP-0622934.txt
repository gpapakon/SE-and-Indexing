<ABSTRACT>
A device for the acoustic identification of a caller in telephone sets has a microprocessor-controlled electronic device which contains a call receiver circuit (1), a holding circuit (3) and a speech memory (4). When a call is received, an identification prompt text stored in the speech memory (4) is automatically forwarded to the caller and the telephone connection is maintained for a predefined period of time. With the aid of a loudspeaker circuit (6, 7) for connecting a loudspeaker (7) at the end of the announcement of the identification prompt text, it is possible for the called party to identify the caller without himself entering into a telephone connection with the caller.
