<DESCRIPTION>
This application pertains to superconducting compositions, more 
specifically, to intermetallic superconducting compositions. Before the recent discovery of copper-oxide based superconductors, the 
materials with the highest superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) were Niobium- and 
Vanadium-based intermetallic compounds with the "A15" structure type. These 
are based on stoichiometry A3B, with the earliest examples V3 Si (Tc = 17K) and 
Nb3Sn (Tc = 18K) discovered in 1953. Tc's in the vicinity of 20K are obtained 
for Nb-based materials only, with the record high Tc of 23K for Nb3Ge obtainable 
in sputtered thin films only, not in bulk material. The highest known bulk Tc is 20.7 
K for Nb3 Ga. The existence of these and many other Nb-based superconductors 
with lower Tc's have led to the general belief that intermetallic superconductors 
should include Nb in the chemical system for the best results. The superconducting magnets currently in wide use in machines such as 
MRI scanners employ Nb based alloy wire, but preparation of bulk materials with 
very high Tc's in the A15 structure type has proven difficult. In view of this 
difficulty, alternative intermetallic superconducting materials with high Tc's would 
be of considerable interest. Although the Tc's of such intermetallic superconductors 
might be expected to be lower than those of the copper oxide based ceramic 
superconductors, the better processability and manufacturability of metals, along 
with the likelihood of good superconducting critical currents suggests possible 
advantages over ceramic materials for use at low temperatures. Although the Tc's of prior art boride superconductors are low, less than 
12K, it has been widely speculated that the low mass of boron might result in the 
presence of high frequency lattice vibrations, and consequently the possibility for 
relatively high Tc's. Recently, indications of superconductivity were discovered in a 
Y-Ni-boride composition. See C. Mazumdar et al., SolidStateCommunications, 
Vol. 87(5), pp. 413-416. A newly discovered Y-Ni-boride, an intermetallic 
composition, was formed by melting Y, Ni and B in nominal 1:4:1 atomic ratio in an 
arc furnace, and had Tc (onset) of about 12K. However, superconductivity was not 
present at high levels in the samples.  
 In view of the great significance of intermetallic superconducting 
compositions, a new such composition would be of great interest, both scientifically 
and technologically. This application discloses such compositions. According to
