<ABSTRACT>
An oil filter assembly for an internal combustion engine 
includes a body (31) which provides inflow and delivery 

passages and an attachable filter element container (45) 
which is attached to the body by a screw-thread at its open 

end to enclose a cylindrical pleated paper filter element 
(41) which is located by a perforated support tube (35) 

carried by the main body, the filter element (35) is sealed 
at one end against the body and is axially positioned by a 

spring (38) acting between the closed end of the container 
and a disc-like closure member (42) which thereby maintains 

engagement between one end of the filter element and the main 
body and sealing closure of the other end of the filter by 

the closure member sealing, the radial and axial compression 
of the filter element being limited by the support tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid filter assemblies and relates 
especially but not exclusively to oil filter assemblies for 
filtering the lubricating oil of an internal combustion 
engine. A now-familiar construction of a fluid filter for an internal 
combustion engine comprises a main metal casting having a 
flat face which provides an annular sealing surface. 
Concentric with said sealing surface a screw-threaded tubular 
spigot projects out of the plane of the surface the interior 
of the spigot providing communication to an oil delivery 
passage. Between the spigot and the annular sealing surface 
further ports are provided which provide communication from 
an oil inlet passage. A generally cylindrical pleated paper 
filter element is housed in a metal container having a 
threaded aperture of a surface at one end to receive the 
threaded spigot and a peripheral annular seal which is 
clamped between the main body and the container. the oil 
flows from the inlet passage into the container and then 
inwards through the filter element to the delivery passage 
via the central passage. Usually the container is metal and 
the filter element itself is built in such a way that it is 
inaccessible. Moreover the filter element itself often is 
provided with metal components such as a centre tube, pleat 
fastenings and end plates. There is now a desire in the motor car industry to encourage  
 
the use of disposable filters of which the component parts 
can be separately recycled or disposed of and dismantling of 
used spin-on cartridges of filter assemblies such as outlined 
above can be tedious and even very difficult for many people. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
an improved low cost fluid filter assembly which not only 
offers ease of servicing but also permits easy separation of 
different materials for disposal or recycling. It is an object of a further aspect of the invention to 
provide means whereby existing filter assemblies may utilise 
the present invention. According to the present invention there is provided a fluid 
filter assembly comprising a body which defines fluid inflow 
and fluid delivery passages said body being provided with 
attachment means to sealingly but detachably receive an open 
end of a container for a generally cylindrical disposable 
filter element said element permitting fluid flow between one 
of said passages and the interior of the container and means 
including resiliently compressible means to locate said 
filter element within said

<CLAIMS>
A fluid filter assembly comprising a body (1; 21; 31) 
which defines fluid inflow and fluid delivery passages said 

body being provided with attachment means to sealingly but 
detachably receive an open end of a container (5; 30; 45) for 

a generally cylindrical disposable filter element (11; 41) 
said element permitting fluid flow between one of said 

passages and the interior of the container and means 
including resiliently compressible means (16; 38) to locate 

said filter element within said container to constrain fluid 
flow between said passages to flow via said filter element 

characterised in that said main body has attachment means 
cooperable with attachment means of the open end of the 

container and a filter support tube (15; 25; 35) located at 
one end by said main body and by which the filter is 

supported said support tube limiting radial and axial 
deformation of the filter element. 
A fluid filter assembly as claimed in claim 1 
characterised in that said support tube (15; 25; 35) is 

attached to said main body. 
A fluid filter assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
characterised in that said filter element is urged with one 

end sealing engagement with said main body by said 
resiliently compressible means acting between the closed end 

of said container (5; 30; 45) and a generally disc shaped 
closure member (17; 42) which sealingly engages the other 

 
end, the axial compression of the filter element being 

limited by available axial clearance between the support tube 
and the closure member. 
A fluid filter assembly as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that said closure member (42) includes a 

pressure relief valve (47). 
A fluid filter assembly as claimed in claim 3 or 4 
characterised in that sealing between said filter element and 

said main body and/or said closure member is provided by 
face-to-face contracts. 
A fluid filter assembly as claimed in claims 1, 2, 3, 4 
or 5 characterised in that said attachment means comprises an 

internal screw-thread (9; 29; 49) which receives an external 
screw-thread (7; 27; 37) of the open end of said container. 
A fluid filter assembly as claimed in claims 1, 2, 3, 4 
or 5 characterised in that said attachment means comprises an 

external screw-thread of said main body which receives in 
internal screw-thread of said open end of said container.
