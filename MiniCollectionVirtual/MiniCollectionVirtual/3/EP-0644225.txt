<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention was to provide a process for the preparation of composite articles made from thermoplastic polyesters and a vulcanisate, in which, in contrast to the prior art, polyesters having an unimpaired processing behaviour are employed. The process found is characterised in that     a) the polyester contains aliphatic double bonds and b) the vulcanisate is prepared under conventional vulcanisation conditions in contact with the hard component by vulcanisation of a rubber composition containing the following components:     I. 100 parts by weight of a rubber,   II. from 0 to 300 parts by weight of fillers,   III. from 1 to 10 parts by weight of peroxidic vulcanising agents,   IV. from 0 to 4 parts by weight of vulcanisation activators,   V. from 0 to 150 parts by weight of plasticisers and   VI. from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of a silane of the formula  X-R

A process for the production of composite articles of 
at least one rigid and at least one flexible component, 

the rigid component being based on a thermoplastic 
polyester and the flexible component being a 

vulcanizate,
 
characterized in that 


a) the thermoplastic polyester contains aliphatic 
double bonds and 
b) the vulcanizate is prepared under customary 
vulcanization conditions in contact with the rigid 

component by vulcanization of a rubber composition
