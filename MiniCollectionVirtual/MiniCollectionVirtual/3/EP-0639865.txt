<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for producing a 
sheet-like electric cell plate and an electrochemical cell 

produced by using the plate. The sheet-like electric cell 
plate is produced by a method which comprises discharging 

an electrode material coating solution from an extrusion-type 
slot die and coating the solution onto an 

electrically-conductive support running around a backup 
roll. The electrochemical cell comprises a positive 

electrode plate, a negative electrode plate, both of which 
plates are produced by the above method, and an 

electrolyte.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a sheet-like electric cell plate (hereinafter
referred to as a "sheet-like plate") in accordance with the generic clause of claim 1 that renders the
production fluctuation of discharge capacity of the cell
small and improves the cycle life of repeating discharge
and recharge of two or more cells connected in series,
parallel, or both of them; and relates to an
electrochemical cell using the above sheet-like plate.Such a method is already disclosed in document US-A-3951688, wherein a substrate is coated with a paste by a nozzle. Rolls are provided to evenly distribute the paste to a desired width on the substrate.Document DE-A-3126795 does not relate to a method for producing a sheet-like electric cell plate, but describes the production of a magnetic storing medium with the help of a slot die and a backup roll.From document WO-A-9 422 659 there is known an apparatus and method for extruding shear thinning material, whereby the thinning material is extruded on to a conductive substrate material, and is then distributed by rolls 15.In nonaqueous electrolyte cells, since the
electric conductivity of the nonaqueous electrolyte used
therein is low in comparison with the electrolyte of
aqueous electrolyte cells, it is required to reduce the
thickness of the electrode layer formed on the
electrically-conductive support. In cylindrical
electrochemical cells, to increase the filling amount of
the electrode-active material, a volute structure having a
sheet-like electrode rolled in a volute fashion is used.Conventionally, as a method for the production
of a sheet-like plate, a milling or rolling process is  
used. That is, an electrically-conductive agent, a
binder, etc., are mixed and kneaded with an electrode-active
material and the mixture is milled between pressure
rolls and filled forcibly into a support, to form a
sheet-like plate. There are also suggested a method
wherein the mixture kneaded is extruded onto both sides of
a support (as described in JP-A ("JP-A" means unexamined
published Japanese patent application) No. 282558/1992),
methods of pulling-up the mixture (as described in JP-A
Nos. 256365/1987 and 114058/1988), and methods of
pulling-down the mixture (as described in JP-A Nos.
267953/1989 and 194265/1989). Although these methods are
efficient because both sides of the support are
simultaneously coated, there are such problems that it is
difficult to place the support at the center of the plate
sheet, and that a thin sheet cannot be made.As
