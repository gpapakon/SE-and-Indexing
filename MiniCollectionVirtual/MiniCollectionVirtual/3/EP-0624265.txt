<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to vehicle 
transmission control shifters and, more particularly, to a 
shifter for controlling an automatic transmission. Conventional automatic transmission shifters comprise 
a metal or plastic mounting bracket which mounts a pivoted 
shift lever for shifting the transmission among a plurality 
of discrete control positions. The bracket mounts a 
plastic or metal cover that has a slot for the shift lever 
that is usually flanked by a PRNDL transmission control 
position indicator. A shift control plate engaged by a lever-mounted 
position pin is usually provided to restrict movement of 
the lever between the control positions. A metal "rooster 
comb" comprising a series of detent notches and a 
cooperating spring-biased follower are provided to locate 
the lever in these positions. Most controls are mechanical, with the lever operating 
a Bowden cable connected to the transmission. Some 
controls are electronic and include a switch operated by 
the control lever which must have an insulated mounting. These conventional shifters are unduly complex and 
expensive to manufacture, comprising 20 to 50 or more 
separate component pieces which must be manually assembled. 
US-A-4 991 535 discloses the preamble of claim 1. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a simpler 
automatic transmission shifter mechanism that comprises 
fewer component pieces and is simpler and less expensive to 
manufacture.  
 It is therefore an object of this invention to provide 
a simpler automatic transmission shifter mechanism that 
comprises fewer component pieces and is simpler and less 
expensive to manufacture. This invention accomplishes this object by combining 
many of the component parts into a single, plastic housing 
that is injection molded in one piece. In one aspect, this invention features a housing for 
an automatic transmission shifter comprising a unitary 
piece of plastic open at the bottom and having spaced 
upper, side and end walls, a slot formed in the upper wall 
for receiving a shifter control lever therethrough, a pair 
of aligned bosses formed in the side walls for mounting a 
shift lever pivot pin, and flanges extending from the side 
and end walls for mounting the housing to vehicle 
structure. In another aspect, this invention features a housing 
for an automatic transmission shifter comprising a unitary 
piece of plastic open at the bottom and having spaced 
upper, side and end walls, a slot formed in the upper wall 
for receiving a shifter control lever
</DESCRIPTION>

along said slot among a plurality of transmission control 
positions (P, R, N, D2, D1, L). 
The shifter of claim 1, further characterized in 
that 


a series of detent notches (120) are formed as part of 
the housing on the interior surface (82) of the housing 

(12) and 
cooperating spring biased detent means (114, 116) are 
mounted on the lever assembly (14, 86) in engagement with 

the detent notches (120) for locating the lever (14) in 
each of the control positions (P, R, N, D2, D1, L). 
The shifter of claim 2, further characterized in 
that 


position control means (122a, 122b) are formed on the 
housing interior surface (82, 84) and have a plurality of 

notches corresponding to the transmission control positions 
(P, R, N, D2, D1, L) and 
the shift lever assembly (14, 86) includes a position  
 

pin (102) movable into and out of the notches, a spring 
(96) biasing the position pin into the notches, and a 

release rod (94) for moving the position pin (102) out of 
the notches. 
The shifter of claim 3, further characterized in 
that 


the position control means (122a, 122b) comprise a 
pair of spaced, aligned, identically-contoured position 

control plates (122a, 122b) formed on the housing interior 
surface (82, 84) flanking the shift lever (14) and 
the position pin (102) engages simultaneously both 
position control plates (122a, 122b). 
The shifter of claim 1, further characterized in 
that 


the position control means (122a, 122b) comprise a 
position control plate (122b) which is formed on the 

housing interior surface (82) adjacent the shift lever (14) 
and has a plurality of notches corresponding to the
