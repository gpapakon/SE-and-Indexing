<ABSTRACT>
A process for thermoforming lofted reinforced 
composites is provided. The process involves (a) 

creating a sealed preform by applying a 
thermoplastic film (22) to a lofted, porous, air 

permeable, fiber reinforced thermoplastic web (20) 
containing thermoplastic particulates; (b) heating 

the sealed preform (24) to a temperature above the melt 
temperature of 
the thermoplastic particulates of the 
web (20); (c) vacuum and/or air pressure forming the 

heated preform to produce a formed article (26). The 
process provides-for the vacuum and/or air pressure 

forming of otherwise porous composite materials. 
The process may be used for making shaped articles 

which may be suitable as sinks, bathtubs or 
automotive panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for 
the thermoforming of thermoplastic webs, and more 
particularly relates to the thermoforming of air 
permeable fiber reinforced thermoplastic webs. Air permeable sheet-like structures (web 
composites) comprising (a) 20% to 60% by weight of 
reinforcing fibers having a high modulus of 
elasticity, and being between about 7 and about 50 
millimeters long, and (b) 40% to 80% by weight of 
wholly or substantially unconsolidated particulate 
plastics material are set forth in published 
European Patent Applications 0,148,760 and 0,148,761 
which are incorporated herein by reference. Such 
sheet-like structures are made from air permeable 
lofted webs of reinforcing fibers and plastic 
particulates. Vacuum and/or air pressure forming such porous 
webs can be difficult due to their air permeability. 
The air permeable nature of the webs allows air to 
be drawn through them, breaking vacuum, and 
preventing a sufficiently substantial pressure 
differential across the web necessary for 
thermoforming thereof. Accordingly, one object of the present 
invention is to provide a process for vacuum and/or 
air pressure thermoforming air permeable webs of 
elastic fibers and thermoplastic particulates.  The present invention involves an air pressure 
differential thermoforming process for air permeable 
webs of reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic 
particulates. The process involves (i) applying a 
thermoplastic cap film to an air permeable composite 
web of reinforcing fiber and thermoplastic 
particulates resulting in a capped preform; (ii) 
heating the preform to a temperature above the melt 
temperature of the thermoplastic resin of the web; 
and (iii) vacuum and/or air pressure forming the 
heated preform to produce a shaped article. Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a web; Figure 2 is a top plan view of the web of 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a side elevational view of a film; Figure 4 is a top plan view of the film of 
Figure 3; Figure 5 is a side elevational view of a film 
capped web preform; Figure 6 is a schematic vertical 
cross-sectional view of a vacuum forming apparatus 
with the capped web preform; Figure 7 is a schematic vertical 
cross-sectional view of the apparatus of Figure 6 
having the vacuum formed article; Figure 8 is a schematic vertical 
cross-sectional view of a vacuum/pressure forming 
apparatus; Figure 9 is a top plan view of the bottom mold
