<ABSTRACT>
A laser-diode-pumped solid-state laser in which a solid-state 
laser crystal (13) is pumped by a laser beam emitted from a 

laser diode (11). An index-guided type multi-transverse mode broad 
area laser (11) having a single optical waveguide is used as 

the laser diode. This leads to reduced output variations and 
noise of the laser. Preferably, the front reflectivity of the 

laser (11) with respect to the oscillation wavelength of the 
same should be more than 20%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laser-diode-pumped solid-state
laser, and more particularly to a laser-diode-pumped solid-state
laser in which output variations and noise are reduced.Gain-guided broad area laser diodes for pumping Nd:YAG solid-state lasers are
suggested from "High-Power Operation of Broad-Area Laser
Diodes with GaAs and AlGaAs Single Quantum Wells for Nd:YAG
Laser Pumping" by k. Shigihara et. al. in
IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 27,
no.6, June 1991, p. 1537-1543 and from "High-Power Operation
of AlGaAs SQW-SCH Broad Area Laser Diodes for Nd:YAG Solid-State
Laser Pumping" by Y. Nagai et. al. in
IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, vol.1, no.2,
Feb. 1991, p.97-99.An index-guided laser diode is known from "Spatial
Mode Structure of Index-guided Broad-Area Quantum-Well
Lasers" by C.J. Chang-Hasnain et.al. in
IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 26,
no.10, Oct.1990, p.1713-1716.As disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,656,635, a
laser-diode-pumped solid-state laser is well known, wherein a
solid-state laser crystal doped with rare earth elements such
as Neodymium is pumped with a laser diode (a semiconductor
laser). In this laser-diode-pumped solid-state laser, an
optical output thereof is detected by a photodetector, and a
drive current of the laser diode is subjected to a feedback
control on the basis of an output obtained from that detection.
Thereby, so-called APC (automatic power control) is effected
for maintaining an optical output at a predetermined value.
Thus, the laser-diode-pumped solid-state laser is often used
while being subjected to APC.In this type of laser-diode-pumped solid-state laser, a
multi-transverse mode broad area laser is often used as a laser
diode in order to obtain a high pump power. More particularly,
the multi-transverse mode broad area laser, conventionally used  
as such a pumping source, is of the gain-guided type which
forms a guide mode using a current gain.In the conventional laser-diode-pumped solid-state laser
that uses the gain guide type multi-transverse mode broad area
laser as a pump source, sharp output variations (so-called
kinks), resulting from variations in drive current of the laser
diode itself, and minute output variations and noise, caused by
returning light which is reflected from a solid-state laser
crystal or the like, occur. This may lead to a considerably
deteriorated linearity of drive current vs. optical output
characteristics of the laser diode. In such a case, it is
impossible to suppress output variations of the
