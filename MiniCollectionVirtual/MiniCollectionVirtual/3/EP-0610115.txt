<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the driving of an electro-hydraulic braking device of an undercarriage, in which each wheel is equipped with a brake actuated from brake pedals via a servovalve which is controlled electrically by a drive unit which measures information corresponding to the degree of depression of the said pedals. In accordance with the invention, when the aircraft is taxiing at low speed, the braking is organised separately for the wheels (Ri) of a first group and for the wheels (Rj) of a second group, with a law of variation of the pressure controlled as a function of the degree of depression of the brake pedals which is specific to each group of wheels and which intervenes over the whole active depression range of the brake pedals (11). One of the two laws (L1) is a continuously increasing function inducing a braking torque from a low value of depression of the brake pedals, while the other braking law (L2) is a continuously increasing function inducing a braking torque only from a predetermined threshold of depression of the said pedals.

A method of controlling an electrohydraulic 
braking apparatus for an aircraft wheel set, in which each 

wheel is fitted with a brake that is actuated from brake 
pedals (11) by means of a servo-valve that is electrically 

controlled by a control unit which measures an information 
corresponding to the depression of said pedals, consisting, 

while the aircraft is taxiing, in separately organizing 
braking for the wheels (Ri) in a first group of wheels 

comprising half of the wheels in question and for the 

wheels (Rj) of a second set of wheels comprising the other 
half of the wheels in question, characterized in that 

braking is performed in compliance with one or the other of 
two different relationships between controlled pressure as 

a function of the depression of brake pedals (11) that is 
respectively specific to each group of wheels, in which a 

first braking relationship (L1) is a continuously increasing 
function that causes a braking torque to be applied 

from a low value of pedal depression (E1), and a second 
braking relationship (L2) which is a continuously increasing 

function that causes a braking torque to be applied 
only from a predetermined threshold (Es) of pedal depression 

which is substantially higher than the said low value 
of pedal depression (E1), said first and second relationships 

acting over the entire active range of depression of 
brake pedals (11) and being selected in such a manner that 

for each relationship the controlled pressure progressively 
increases from a predetermined low threshold value (P
o
), and 
that the same controlled pressure is ensured at maximum 

brake pedal depression (E2), so that the mean overall 
pressure varies in compliance with a function which is 

continuous over the entire range of brake pedal depression. 
A control method according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the first and second braking relationships 

(L1, L2) are identical from a predetermined high value (E3)  
 

of depression of the brake pedals (11) up to maximum 
depression of said pedals, the said predetermined high 

value (E3) being higher than the predetermined threshold 
(Es) of pedal depression from which a braking torque is 

applied in compliance with the second braking relationship 
(L2). 
A control method according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the predetermined high value (E3) is 

selected so that the corresponding controlled pressure is 
less than a mean threshold pressure (P
A
) of anti-skid 
members associated with the brakes. 
A control method according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the first and second 

braking relationships (L1, L2) are constituted by one or 
more slopes. 
A control method according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that braking relationship 

allocation is automatically alternated between the two 
groups of wheels each time the brake pedals (11) are 

released from an amount of depression that is less than a 
predetermined low value, such that the braking applied to 

each group of wheels is organized alternately in application 
of one or the other of the two braking relationships 

(L1, L2). 
A control method according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, for use in controlling the braking of two 

subsets each comprising a plurality of pairs of wheels 
disposed on either side of a longitudinal midplane of the 

aircraft, characterized in that each group of wheels (Ri, 
Rj) comprises one wheel in each pair for one subset, and 

the wheels of the other subset that are symmetrical thereto 
about the said longitudinal plane. 
An apparatus for implementing the control 
method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, including a 

hydraulic generator (13) and an associated electrically  
 

controlled valve (14) for feeding a hydraulic circuit (15) 
to which servo-valves (SVi, SVj) are connected, a control 

unit (10) which measures an information given by an 
associated sensor (12) corresponding to the degree of brake 

pedal depression and which electrically controls the 
above-mentioned servo-valves (SVi, SVj), with each of said 

servo-valves (SVi, SVj) feeding a respective brake in one 
of two groups of brakes (Fi, Fj), characterized in that 

each servo-valve (Si, SVj) is controlled by the 
above-mentioned control unit (10) in compliance with one or 

the other of two different braking relationships (L1, L2) 
which is respectively specific to each group of wheels (Ri, 

Rj), as a function of the degree to which the brake pedals 
(11) are depressed, in which a first braking relationship 

is a continuously increasing function that causes a braking 
torque to be applied from a low value of pedal depression, 

and a second braking relationship which is a continuously 
increasing function that causes a braking torque to be 

applied only from a predetermined threshold of pedal 
depression which is substantially higher than the above-mentioned 

low value, the said first and second relationships 
acting over the entire active range of brake pedal 

depression and being selected in such a manner that for 
each relationship the controlled pressure progressively 

increases from a predetermined low threshold value, and 
that the same controlled pressure is ensured at maximum 

brake pedal depression, so that the mean overall pressure 
varies in compliance with a function which is continuous 

over the entire range of brake pedal depression. 
An apparatus according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the control unit (10) includes control means 

enabling the allocation of a braking relationship (L1, L2) 
to one and the other of the groups of wheels (Ri, Rj) to be 

alternated automatically each time the brake pedals (11) 
are released from a degree of depression that is less than 

a predetermined low value.
