<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION RELATES TO cyclic compounds and to a 
process for making them. The compounds are useful 
intermediates in the fields of agrochemicals and 
pharmaceuticals. Certain cis 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadienes are useful in the 
preparation of novel polymers. In our European Patent 
Specification No. 76606 B we disclose a process for the 
production of such dihydroxy cyclohexadienes from aromatic 
compounds using mutant strains of the species Pseudomonas 
putida, in particular mutants of P. putida strains NCIB 11767 
and NCIB 11680. The enzyme which catalyses the reaction 
involved in this process is an aromatic dioxygenase which 
catalyses a reaction between certain aromatic compounds and 
oxygen for example, the reaction below between benzene and 
oxygen 
When strains such as P. putida NCIB 11767 and NCIB 11680 
are fed with aromatics, the dihydroxy cyclohexadiene compounds 
do not accumulate since they are rapidly further oxidised via 
catechols to products of intermediary metabolism. However, in 
our European Patent No. 76606-B we describe how mutants of 
these microorganisms may be produced which are unable to 
oxidise the dihydroxy cyclohexadienes and these as a result 
accumulate when such mutants are exposed to aromatic 
substrates. Some of these mutants must be grown in the 
presence of benzene or toluene if the activity of the aromatic 
dioxygenase enzyme needed to convert aromatics to dihydroxy 
cyclohexadienes is to be induced. The process of our European Patent 76606-B, particularly 
when carried out using microbial cells produced by the method 
of European Patent No. 250 122 B, enables conversions of  
 
aromatic compounds to be achieved to produce some interesting 
new cyclic dihydroxy compounds. In our EP-A-364 152 we 
disclose compounds of the formula 
 
where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group, and a process 
for preparation of such compounds using Pputida. The process of EP-A-364 152 involves crystalising the 
cyclic dihydroxy compounds under conditions of extremely low 
temperatures (for example, -78Â°C) which are not practical or 
economic for the preparation of large quantities of the 
compounds for use in the preparation of, for example, 
agrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. Surprisingly, it has been found that preparation of the 
novel compounds of the present invention can be achieved with 
much less difficulty and more economically by the process of 
the present invention. According to the invention there is provided a 
cyclohexadiene compound of formula (I) or (II) 
 
where
