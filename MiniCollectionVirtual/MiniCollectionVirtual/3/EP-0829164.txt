<ABSTRACT>
Video conferencing system including stations at a plurality of different sites, and in which system first and second video channels are simultaneously displayed at each site station on a picture-in-picture video monitor (24), a site controller (28) causes a video decoder (14) at the site to decode either a video signal generated at the site or a video signal received from another site via the first video channel. The site controller (28) also responds to a channel assignment signal generated by a system controller by assigning the first video channel to either a first predetermined broadcast frequency or to a second predetermined broadcast frequency and by assigning a second video channel carrying a video signal received from another site to the other available broadcast frequency. The system controller processes channel allocation requests signals with a predetermined priority from the different sites to generate the channel assignment signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to video conferencing systems and methods and is
particularly directed to simultaneously displaying at each of a plurality of sites video
signals generated at a plurality of said sites.In one prior art video conferencing system and method, video signals generated at
a plurality of sites are transmitted to a central site, where the transmitted video signal
having the highest priority for a primary display is combined with the transmitted video
signal having the highest priority for a secondary display to provide a composite video
signal for providing a simultaneous display of both the primary display and the secondary
display, such as a picture-in-picture display, wherein the primary display occupies most
of the screen of a video monitor and the secondary display occupies one corner of the
primary display. One use for this system and method is to provide a primary display of a
lecturer and a secondary display of a person questioning the lecturer. The choice of the
site for the secondary display is based upon voice activation. This prior art system and
method requires as many separate simplex video channel as there are sites in the system
and there is an approximately 0.56 second round-trip delay for video signal transmission
throughput.A bi-directional video transmission system is described in US-A-5 365 264. The present invention provides a system for simultaneously displaying at each of
a plurality of sites video signals generated at a plurality of said sites, comprising at each
site: a video encoder for encoding a video signal generated at said site to provide an
encoded video signal; a broadcast channel modem for conditioning the encoded video
signal generated at said site for transmission to the other sites via a first video channel
and for demodulating a video signal received via said one video channel; a demodulator
for demodulating a video signal received via a second video channel; a first video
decoder for decoding the demodulated video signal received via the second video
channel; a second video decoder for decoding either the video signal generated at said
site or the video signal received via the first video channel; means coupled to the first and
second video decoders for simultaneously displaying the decoded video signal received
via the second video channel and either the decoded video signal generated at said site or
the decoded video signal received via the first video channel; characterised by a site
controller coupled to the second video decoder for
