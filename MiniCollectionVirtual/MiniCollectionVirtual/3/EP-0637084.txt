<ABSTRACT>
A radiation imager includes a photosensor barrier layer 
disposed between an amorphous silicon photosensor array and the 

scintillator. The barrier layer includes two strata, the first stratum 
being silicon oxide di
sposed over the upper conductive layer of the 
photosensor array and the second stratum is silicon nitride that is 

disposed over the first stratum. The photosensor barrier layer has a 
shape that substantially conforms to the the shape of the underlying 

upper conductive layer and has a maximum thickness of about 3 
microns. The silicon oxide and silicon nitride are deposited in a vapor 

deposition process at less than about 250 °C using tetraethoxysilane 
(TEOS) as the silicon source gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid state radiation imager.Solid state imagers typically include a photosensor
array coupled to a scintillating medium. Radiation absorbed in the
scintillator generates optical photons which in turn pass into a
photosensor, such as a photodiode, in which the optical photon is
absorbed and an electrical signal corresponding to the incident
optical photon flux is generated. Substantially hydrogenated
amorphous silicon (a-Si) is commonly used in the fabrication of
photosensors due to the advantageous photoelectric characteristics
of a-Si and the relative ease of fabricating such devices. In particular,
photosensitive elements, such as photodiodes, can be formed in
connection with necessary control or switching elements, such as thin
film transistors (TFT's), in a relatively large array. In such arrays both
the TFT's and the photodiodes typically comprise a-Si. The performance of amorphous silicon based imagers
can be degraded by a number of factors, including, for example,
exposure to moisture (which can cause the leakage of a-Si
photodiodes to increase irreversibly), exposure to materials, such as
solvents used in the fabrication process, that degrade the electrical
characteristics of the a-Si photodiode or may damage the polymeric
dielectric materials, or by exposure to temperatures higher than those
of the a-Si deposition processes (e.g., greater than about 250°C). It is
thus beneficial to use fabrication processes that do not present
adverse environmental conditions and to provide a protective
boundary for a-Si components to minimize degradation both in
fabrication and during operation of the imager. A protective boundary
disposed between the a-Si components of the photosensor array and
the scintillator in an imager desirably provides 1) protection of the
photosensor array from contamination by the scintillating medium
(and vice versa); 2) a good surface to which the scintillator material
can adhere; 3) good optical coupling between the scintillator and the
underlying pixels in the imager array (that is, a high degree of
transmission of the optical photons with a minimum of scattering of the
photons); and, 4) a good environmental barrier to protect the
photosensor array, especially from moisture.In U.S. Patent No. 4,906,850 to Beerlage, a thick layer of
dielectric, such as silicon nitride or silicon oxide, is deposited over the
photosensor array such that it can be patterned to form a number of
islands on which a scintillator can be vapor deposited so that it grows
up from
