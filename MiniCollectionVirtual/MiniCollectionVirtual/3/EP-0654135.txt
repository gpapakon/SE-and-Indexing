<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an oil-burner nozzle connection including electrical sub-assemblies. The aim of the invention is to ensure that these sub-assemblies, in particular PTC heating elements, can be assembled simply and with high contacting accuracy. This is achieved by use of a conductive sheet which has conductor-track zones which are not covered by insulating layers and which, when folded, touch the PTC contact surfaces and have the necessary soldering lands which match the contact points of other electrical sub-assemblies.

<CLAIMS>
Oil burner nozzle assembly comprising electrical components, in 
particular at least one PTC-heating element, characterized in that a 

conducting foil (3) is employed for current supply within the nozzle 

assembly, which conducting foil (3) being provided on one of its faces 
with non-insulated conducting areas (2, 21) embodied in such a manner 

that when the conducting foil is folded it contacts the contact areas of 
said at least one PCT-heating element (1), the conducting foil base 

material (6) providing the external electrical insulation of the heating 
element in enveloping the latter. 
Nozzle assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein, apart from contacts 
(5) for establishing electrical connections of the nozzle assembly to the 

outside and for said non-insulated conducting areas (2, 21), soldering 
terminals (4) are provided which are positioned to meet the contact 

areas of further electrical components of the nozzle assembly such as 
thermostat switches and/or rectifiers and/or magnet valves. 
Nozzle assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the electrical 
contacting of the entire electrical components within the nozzle 

assembly is achieved by a single conducting foil once and multiple 
folded, respectively 
Nozzle assembly according to one of the preceding claims, wherein at 
least one PCT-heating element (1) is entirely covered on both of its 

contact faces by the conducting foil portions comprising the non-insulated 
conducting areas (2, 21) and is electrically insulated to the 

exterior via the conducting foil base material. 
Nozzle assembly as claimed in claims 1 or 4, wherein at least said 
one of the PCT-heating elements enveloped by said conducting foil 

portions is clamped upon the fuel duct of the nozzle assembly. 
Nozzle assembly as claimed in claims 1 or 4, wherein the conducting 
foil portion comprising the non-insulated conducting areas is provided 

with twice the number of non-insulated conducting areas as PCT-heating 
elements employed and is once and multi-folded, respectively.
