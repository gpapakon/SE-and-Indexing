<ABSTRACT>
Mono-alkadienyl alkyl ethers and di-alkadienyl 
alkyl ethers are prepared by telomerization of a 

conjugated diene, by causing said conjugated diene to 
react with an aliphatic alcohol or an aliphatic diol 

respectively, by operating in an aqueous/organic 
biphasic liquid system, in the presence of a catalytic 

system formed by: 

-- (a) a palladium salt or complex; 
-- (b) an alkyl-, alkylcycloalkyl-, or alkylaryl-phosphine 
ligand, bearing an acidic or neutral 

hydrophylic moiety, having the formula: 

 
wherein R₁, R₂, R₃, x and y are as defined in 

the disclosure; and 
-- (c) an either inorganic or organic base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing mono- and di-alkadienyl alkyl ethers by 
means of the telomerization of conjugated dienes and 
to a catalytic system suitable for that purpose. Alkadienyl alkyl ethers are well known compounds 
in the art, which find use in particular as solvents 
for paints, components in cosmetic formulations and 
crosslinking agents for organic polymers. The reaction 
of telomerization of conjugated dienes (for example, 
butadiene, and isoprene, with a compound 
bearing an active hydrogen atom (for example water, 
alcohol, carboxy acids, amines, and ammonia 
is known to be catalyzed by transition metal compounds 
(in particular palladium compounds) and phosphines (J. 
Tsuji, Adv. Organomet. Chem. 17, 141-193, 1979; R.F. 
Heck, "Palladium reagents in organic syntheses" 1990 
Academic Press). A problem met with these telomerization reactions 
derives from the difficulty of separating and 
recovering the catalyst from the reaction products. On considering the high cost of the catalyst, it 
is evident that simplifying the recycle of said 
catalyst would lead to a more advantageous process 
from the financial view point. In this regard, one 
should observe that the catalyst is soluble in the 
reaction system and that, owing to the thermal 
instability thereof, not always the separation of the 
reaction products by distillation without decomposing  
 
the catalyst is possible. Therefore, the use of 
sulfonated aryl phosphines in the telomrization 
reactions was proposed in the art, as disclosed in the 
following patents: FR 2,366,237, DE 2,733,516, EP 
296,550 and EP 436,226, which make it possible the 
catalyst to be separated from the reaction products by 
means of a simple phase separation. In fact, said 
phosphines endow the catalyst with a hydrophilic 
character, which catalyst is consequently selectively 
kept in the polar phase, whilst the reaction products 
remain in the apolar phase. The present Applicant found now, according to the 
present invention, that the use of particular alkyl, 
alkylcycloalkyl or alkylaryl phosphines bearing an 
acidic or neutral hydrophilic moiety in their 
molecule, as ligands for palladium, in a process of 
telomerization of conjugated dienes, makes it possible 
the catalyst activity and selectivity to the desired 
telomers to be unespectedly improved, because the 
telomerization exclusively or substantially 
exclusively takes place at the conjugated function. The present Applicant found furthermore that the 
use of such ligands
