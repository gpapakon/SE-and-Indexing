<ABSTRACT>
Methods of monitoring the operation of a refrigeration 
system (10), including interlocking the selection and 

operation of an engine (18) and electric motor (34) which 
are arranged to alternatively function as prime movers for 

a refrigerant compressor; detecting slippage of a clutch 
connected between the engine and compressor (12); and, 

detecting improper rotational direction of an evaporator 
fan motor (64). The interlocking method prevents 

energization (180,198) of the drive motor while the engine 
is operative, and it includes monitoring engine oil pressure 

(170,186) and engine RPM (172,204). The clutch 
slippage method includes detecting engine speed fluctuations 

(284,310) and the polarity of battery current 
(252,258,290). The monitoring of the evaporator fan motor 

(64), which drives a fan (66) which draws return air from 
a conditioned space (82), and discharges conditioned air 

into the conditioned space, includes the steps (220,230) of 
comparing the difference between the temperatures of the 

return air and discharge air with a predetermined reference 
value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to methods of 
operating a refrigeration system: (1) to interldck the 
operation of first and second selectable compressor prime 
movers which respectively include an engine and a clutch, 
and an electric motor; (2) to detect slippage of the clutch 
during operation of the engine; and, (3) to detect improper 
rotational direction of an evaporator fan motor. It is common in the field of transport refrigeration 
to selectively operate a refrigerant compressor via 
one of two prime movers. A first prime mover includes an 
internal combustion engine, such as a diesel engine, and a 
centrifugal or electric clutch; and, a second prime mover 
includes an electric drive motor. The engine and clutch 
drive the compressor while the associated truck, trailer, 
container, and the like, is away from a terminal, and the 
electric motor drives the compressor while the refrigeration 
system is accessible to a source of electrical potential, 
such as at a terminal or on board a ship. U.S. 
Patents 3,720,842; 3,941,012; 4,616,743; 4,811,569; 
4,846,327; and 5,105,096, all of which are assigned to the 
same assignee as the present application, illustrate 
arrangements for selectively and alternatively utilizing an 
internal combustion engine or an electric motor to drive a 
refrigerant compressor. It would be desirable, and it is a first object of 
the invention, to be able to interlock the selection and  
 
operation of the engine and drive motor, to prevent 
energization of the electric motor while the engine is 
operative, and to de-energize the electric motor when 
running if starting of the engine is attempted. It would also be desirable, and it is another 
object of the invention, to be able to detect slippage of 
the clutch disposed between the internal combustion engine 
and the refrigerant compressor. It would also be desirable, and it is still 
another object of the invention, to be able to detect 
improper rotational direction of an evaporator fan motor, 
to provide back-up protection in the event an electrical 
phase detector is faulty, improperly connected, or not 
used. Briefly, the invention includes a method of 
interlocking the selection and operation of an internal 
combustion engine and an electric drive motor which are 
arranged to selectively and alternatively function as a 
prime mover for a refrigerant compressor in a refrigeration 
system, to prevent energization of the electric motor while 
the engine is operative. The method includes the steps of 
monitoring
