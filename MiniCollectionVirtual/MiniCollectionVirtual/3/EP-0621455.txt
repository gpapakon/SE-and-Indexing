<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a water box (52) and expansion 
chamber (51) assembly comprising moulding a housing (2) using a 

moulding tool (5 or 35) of at least two members (6 or 36, 8 or 38). A 
baflle (3) is subsequently fitted to the housing (2) to separate the water 

box (52) from the expansion chamber (51).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of a water 
box and expansion chamber assembly for a heat exchanger such as 
the radiator in the cooling circuit of a motor vehicle engine. The 
water box and expansion chamber are separated by a common wall 
within a housing. An orifice is provided in the wall and a siphon tube 
may be fitted so as to pass through the orifice to connect the water 
box to the expansion chamber. US Patent No. 4592418 discloses such an assembly in which 
the water box and expansion chamber are disposed generally 
vertically with the upper part of the expansion chamber being 
provided with a liquid filler orifice suitable for receiving a cap that 
may include a pressure release valve. In order to function correctly the volume of the expansion 
chamber has to be substantially greater, e g up to ten times greater, 
than the volume of the water box. Since the height of each must be 
the same i.e. approximately equal to the height of the radiator, and 
because of the closeness of the engine and other components in the 
engine compartment of the car, both the width and breadth of the 
expansion chamber are of necessity greater than the width and 
breadth respectively of the water box. Several methods of manufacturing such an assembly by 
moulding have been devised but these usually entail forming the 
housing in more than one part which then have to be joined by 
welding and it has been found that the welded joints are often prone 
to leaks when the pressure and temperature of the coolant rises in 
use. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of 
manufacturing such an assembly using a moulding technique which 
substantially overcomes this disadvantage. In accordance with the invention a method of manufacturing 
a water box and expansion chamber comprises moulding in a  
 
moulding press a housing using a moulding tool of at least two 
members, removing the moulded housing from the press and fitting 
a baffle to the housing to separate the water box from the expansion 
chamber. In accordance with the invention also a method of 
manufacturing a water box and expansion chamber assembly is 
characterised in that a housing therefor is moulded in a moulding 
press, by assembling a moulding tool of a main member and at least 
one further member while the press is open, closing the press to 
cause the assembled moulding tool to be positioned within a mould, 
injecting moulding material into a moulding space between the 
moulding tool and the mould to form the

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a water box (52) and expansion 
chamber (51) assembly characterised by comprising moulding in a 

moulding press a housing (2) using a moulding tool (5 or 35) of at least 
two members (6,8 or 36,38), removing the moulded housing (2) from 

the press and fitting a baffle (3) to the housing to separate the water 
box (52) from the expansion chamber (51). 
A method of manufacturing a water box (52) and expansion 
chamber (51) assembly characterised in that a housing (2) therefor is 

moulded in a moulding press, by assembling a moulding tool (5 or 35) 
of a main member (6 or 36) and at least one further member (8 or 38) 

while the press is open, closing the press to cause the assembled 
moulding tool (5 or 35) to be positioned within a mould, injecting 

moulding material into a moulding space between the moulding tool and 
the mould to form the housing (2), opening the press, moving the main 

member (6 or 36) away from the moulded housing (2), the at least one 
further member (8 or 38), becoming at least partially detached from the 

main member (6), removing the moulded housing (2) from the press, 
and fitting a baffle (3) to the housing to provide a common wall 

between the water box (52) and the expansion chamber (51). 
A method according to Claim 2 characterised in that said further 
member (8 or 38) is attached to the main member (6 or 36). 
A method according to Claim 2 characterised in that the further 
member (8 or 38) is attachable to the main member (6 or 36). 
A method according to Claim 3 or Claim 4 characterised in that 
said further member (8 or 38) is attached or attachable to the main 

member (6 or 36) by means of complementary formations to form a 
slide (9 or 39). 
A method according to Claim 5 characterised in that the 
complementary formations forming the slide (9 or 39) are of dovetail 

configuration. 
A method according to Claim 3 or Claim 4 characterised in that 
said further member (8 or 38) is attached or attachable to the main 

member (6 or 36) by means of complementary formations to form a 
pivot. 
A method according to any one of Claims 2-7 characterised in 
that the further member (8 or 38) becomes wholly detached from the 

main member (6 or 36) on moving the main member (6 or 36) away 
from the moulded housing (2) and remains with the housing (2). 
A method according to Claim 8 characterised in that the housing 
and further member (8 or 38) are subsequently removed together from 

the press and then separated. 
A method according to Claim 8 characterised in that the further 
member (8 or 38) is moved on moving the main member (6 or 36) away 

from the moulded housing (2) and is thus separated from the housing 
(2) with the main member (6 or 36). 
A method according to any one of Claims 2-10 characterised in 
that the main member (6 or 36) comprises a plurality of components 

which move together on closing of the press. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the housing (2) is moulded to have at least one 

internal housing formation (10,11,18) and the baffle (3) is sealingly 
fitted to said housing formation. 
A method according to Claim 12 characterised in that the housing 
formation comprises a flange (10), a ledge (11) or a shoulder (18) and 

the baffle (3) is fitted by suitable attachment means (16). 
A water box and expansion chamber assembly manufactured by 
a method according to any one of the preceding claims.
