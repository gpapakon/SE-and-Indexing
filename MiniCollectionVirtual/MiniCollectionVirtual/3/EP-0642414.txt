<CLAIMS>
Metal/plastic film composite containing 
inorganic oxides, characterized in that 0.1 to 8% by 

weight, preferably 0.5 to 8% by weight, relative to the 
total weight of the thermoplastic of the plastic film 

and of the inorganic oxides, of a powder consisting of 
zinc oxide and/or manganese oxide is incorporated in 

the plastic film and/or in the adhesion promoter layer 
or adhesive layer located between the metal and the 

plastic film, and the metal of the composite has a 
thickness of at least 0.08 mm. 
Metal/plastic film composite according to Claim 
1, characterized in that 2 to 4% by weight of zinc 

oxide, relative to the total weight of the thermoplastic 
of the plastic film and of the inorganic 

oxides, is incorporated in the plastic film. 
Metal/plastic film composite according to Claim 
1 or 2, characterized in that the mean particle size of 

the zinc oxide and of the manganese oxide is in the 
range from 0.1 to 10 Âµm. 
Metal/plastic film composite according to 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the plastic film 

is obtained by extrusion of random polypropylene 
copolymer, preferably by extrusion of polypropylene 

copolymer consisting of 1 to 4% by weight of ethylene 
and 96 to 99% by weight of propylene, relative to the 

total weight of the monomer composition. 
Process for producing the metal/plastic film 
composite according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 

that a thermoplastic is co-extruded with an adhesion 
promoter and the film produced is laminated to a metal 

sheet, the zinc oxide powder and/or the manganese oxide 
powder having been incorporated into the thermoplastic 

film and/or into the adhesion promoter layer, or a 
thermoplastic film is laminated by means of a 

solvent-containing or aqueous adhesive to a metal 
sheet, the zinc oxide powder and/or the manganese oxide 

powder having been incorporated into the thermoplastic 
film and/or into the adhesive layer.  

 
Use of the metal/plastic film composite according 
to one or more of Claims 1 to 4 for the manufacture 

of cans.
