<ABSTRACT>
- Method for bounded insertion of a flexible decoration into a thermoplastic support, by low-pressure overmoulding, the mould having cavities (10a) into which the molten injected plastic (10) penetrates, passing through the decoration (1), sharp edges (11, 12) being provided on the die (3), and the ram (punch) (5) cutting off the excess decoration, on opening the mould, after injection.

A method of inserting a defined piece of decoration in a rigid thermoplastic
support (10) by low-pressure overmolding of the textile decoration placed in a

mold that comprises a die (3) and a punch (5), the decoration being placed
against the die (3) of the mold and being pressed thereagainst by the

injection pressure, the method being characterized in that the die (3) has
spacers (8, 9) each presenting a sharp projecting edge (11), the die (3) cooperating

with a spacer (9) to form a cavity (10a) over which the decoration
(1 ) is tensioned, the injected material (10) penetrating during injection into the

cavity (10a) through the decoration (1) so as to integrate the decoration in the
injected
 material, the decoration (1) being cut along its edge facing the
outside of the cavity (10a) by the die (3) and the punch (5) moving apart.
A method accordion to claim 1, characterized in that the punch (5) has at
least one second cavity (12a) disposed beneath said cavity (10a) formed by

the die (3) and the spacer (9), the two cavities being defined by said sharp
edge (11) of said spacer (9) and a second sharp edge (12) situated above

said sharp edge (12) of said spacer (9) when the mold is closed, the edges
(11, 12) acting during opening of the mold to cut off excess decoration at the

outside edge of the cavity (10a) by the die (3) and the punch (5) moving
apart.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it includes a
second overmolding step in a second mold, the material injected (20, 20a)

during the second step being chemically bonded to the first piece (10) via one
of the margins (16) thereof.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the thermoplastic
piece is made in two steps without opening the mold:


during the first step, the peripheral portion (30) is injected over the
decoration (1) and integrates the margins thereof by the material passing

through the decoration; and
during the second step the cavity (4) of the die (3) and the decoration
(1 ) are moved away from the punch (5) and injection is performed again, the

two injected portions being connected together by chemical bonding, thereby
providing sealing without a wick effect and without transferring moisture.
