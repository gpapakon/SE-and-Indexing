<ABSTRACT>
An annular safety system for a well produced by 
gas lift includes a packer (15), a landing nipple (16) below 

the packer and an operating seal unit (14) to which primary 
(11) and secondary (12) well tubings and a control line (22) 

are connected. There is an inline valve (13) in the 
secondary tubing (12) and safety valve (20) operated by the 

control line in a primary flow conduit (18) in the operating 
seal unit. After the operating seal unit (14) is inserted 

through the packer (15) to automatically land and be locked 
in the landing nipple (16) and the packer (15) operated to 

anchor and seal in a well casing, flow passages are formed 
for conveying lift gas from the secondary tubing to around 

the landing nipple for lifted flow upward through the 
primary conduit and tubing. When the well is being produced 

by lift gas, and pressure in the control line (22) is 
reduced purposely or by rupture of the control line, the 

safety valve (20) operates to prevent upward lifted flow in 
the primary tubing. If lift gas pressure in the secondary 

tubing is reduced purposely or by rupture, the inline valve 
(13) prevents upward flow. The operating seal unit (14) may 

be unlocked from the landing nipple (16) for retrieval from 
the packer (15) and well.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an annular safety system 
for a cased well. The known annular safety systems for gas lift 
wells utilize complicated and expensive assortments of 
packers, sidepocket mandrels, gas lift valves and safety 
valves. These annular safety system installations require 
pressurized gas or production in tubing casing annular flow 
passages with inaccessible safety valves positioned below 
one or two packers. Well servicing tools cannot be lowered 
into some of the installations on wireline because of 
restrictions or abrupt offsets in the flow conduits. We have now devised an annular safety system for a 
cased well, which system requires no gas lift valves or side 
pocket mandrels, and only one packer. Pressurized lift gas 
or production does not flow in the tubing casing annulus. 
All safety valves used are above the only packer required 
and are thus easily retrievable. Full bore tubings are 
utilized permitting wireline servicing tools to be lowered 
through the production tubing. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an annular safety system for a cased well 
comprising: 
(a) packer means for anchoring and sealing in said casing, 
said packer means having outlet ports for flow from inside 
to outside said packer means;  (b) a landing nipple connected below said packer means; 
and (c) operating seal unit means for operating said packer 
means to anchor and seal in said casing, said operating seal 
unit means sealingly engaging and extending through said 
packer means to form an annular flow passage communicating 
with said packer means outlet ports, said operating seal 
unit means including: a dual head having primary and 
secondary well tubing connected thereto, a valve permitting 
downward flow and automatically preventing upward flow in 
said secondary well tubing, a primary flow conduit therein 
connected to said dual head and having a flow passage 
communicating said primary tubing through said landing 
nipple with said well casing below said packer means, said 
primary flow conduit having a safety valve therein operable 
to prevent upward flow in said primary conduit, lockable 
locator means on said primary flow conduit for landing and 
releasably locking in said landing nipple, and annular flow 
passages therein for communicating said secondary tubing 
with said annular flow passage through said packer means. The annular safety system of this invention 
utilizes a packer which is hydraulically operable to anchor 
and seal in a well casing. Suspended below the
