<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by the partial oxidation of a
hydrocarbon feed, in particular of a hydrocarbon feed comprising
carbon dioxide.The partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, for example methane or
natural gas, in the presence of a catalyst is an attractive route
for the preparation of mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen,
known in the art as synthesis gas. The partial oxidation of a
hydrocarbon is a highly exothermic reaction and, in the case in
which methane is the hydrocarbon, proceeds by the following
reaction:
2CH4 + O2 → 2CO + 4H2Processes for the catalytic partial oxidation of hydrocarbons,
such as methane, are known and described in the art. For example,
D.A. Hickman and L.D. Schmidt ("Synthesis Gas Formation by Direct
Oxidation of Methane over Pt Monoliths", Journal of Catalysis 138,
1992, pages 267 to 282) have conducted experiments into the partial
oxidation of methane in the presence of catalysts comprising either
platinum or rhodium. The catalysts employed were in the form of a
polycrystalline platinum foil or rhodium or platinum supported on a
ceramic foam carrier. The partial oxidation reactions were
conducted at substantially atmospheric pressure, at temperatures in
the range of from 600 to 1500 K (337 to 1237 °C) and using a range
of gas flow rates. The experiments used a mixture consisting of
methane and oxygen or air as the feed. The experiments achieved a
typical methane conversion of 80% with typical selectivities to
carbon monoxide and hydrogen of 90% and 50% respectively. Further, P.D.F. Vernon et al ("Partial Oxidation of Methane to
Synthesis Gas, and Carbon Dioxide as an Oxidising Agent for Methane
Conversion", Catalysis Today, 13 (1992) 417-426) describe the
partial oxidation of methane by oxygen to give synthesis gas using
the transition metals nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium,
platinum and iridium supported on inert oxides.Suitable feedstocks for use in the catalytic partial oxidation
process, in addition to comprising hydrocarbons such as methane,
can also comprise carbon dioxide. Indeed, some natural gas
reserves contain carbon dioxide in significant quantities.
Accordingly, there is a need for a commercial process for the
conversion of the aforementioned hydrocarbon feedstocks comprising
carbon dioxide into mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.The reforming of hydrocarbons using carbon dioxide is a well
known process. The process is endothermic which, in the case of
the reforming of methane,
