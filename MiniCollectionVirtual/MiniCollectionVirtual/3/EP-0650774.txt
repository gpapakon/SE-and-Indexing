<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and 
an apparatus for the cleaning of air 

ducts. The brushing device of the invention, 
supported by supporting and friction 

brushes (2), is moved in an air duct 
in the transverse direction of the duct. 

The direction of rotation of the drive 
motor (1) of the apparatus is reversed by 

means of a pneumatic control system, 
enabling the brush to move back and forth 

in the duct so as to produce an efficient 
brushing result.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure as defined in the 
preamble of claim 1 and an apparatus as defined in the preamble 
of claim 3 for the cleaning of air ducts. Previously known is e.g. the procedure and apparatus for the 
cleaning of air ducts presented in Finnish patent application 
902078. In this known solution, a suction fan is connected to a 
desired point in the piping and the connections close to the 
suction fan are temporarily closed. When a cleaning brush is 
then inserted into the duct at a point at a distance from the 
fan, the dust and dirt loosened by the brush are carried by the 
suction into the container of the suction fan. The brushing 
device used in this solution comprises a motor-driven brush 
which is supported by wheels running along the duct walls. A 
drawback with this known solution is that each brushing device 
can only be fitted for one pipe or duct size. Therefore, in 
ducts larger than the designed size, the brush moves along the 
bottom or the duct but leaves the upper part uncleaned. The object or the present invention is to correct the drawbacks 
mentioned above and to achieve a new type of procedure and apparatus 
for the cleaning of air ducts which is cheap and reliable 
in operation. The procedure of the invention is characterized by 
what is said in the characterization part of claim 1. Similarly, 
the apparatus of the invention is characterized by what is said 
in the characterization part of claim 3. In addition, different 
embodiments of the invention are characterized by what is said 
in the characterization parts of the subclaims. The solution or the invention has the advantage that it allows 
easy cleaning or ducts having a rectangular, square, elliptical 
or circular cross section. Moreover, the solution of the invention 
is applicable for the cleaning of ducts of various cross-sectional 
sizes. Since the brushing device also moves in the 
widthwise direction, it can be used to clean even ducts having a 
large width and a rectangular or ellipctical cross-sectional  
 
form by making use of an automatic feature for the change of the 
direction of rotation. In addition, a flexible spiral shaft 
coupler can be fitted between the shaft of the pneumatic motor 
and the brush fixture. This coupler enhances the sideways movement 
of the brushing device when required, making it easier for 
the brushing device to move in the corner areas of the ducts. In the following, the invention is described in detail by the 
aid of an example of its embodiments by

<CLAIMS>
Procedure for the cleaning of air ducts, in which procedure a 
motor-driven brushing device provided with a cleaning brush (3) 

is moved in the air duct to be cleaned, characterized in that 
the brushing device is equipped with supporting and friction 

brushes (2) supporting the cleaning brush (3) and that, during 
the brushing, the brushing device is driven, if necessary, in 

the transverse direction of the duct by means of a driving motor 
(1), the brushing device being supported by the brushes (2, 3), 
Procedure for the cleaning of air ducts according to claim 1, 
characterized in that, by reversing the direction of rotation of 

the drive motor (1), the brushing device is driven in the duct 
back and forth in the widthwise direction of the duct during 

brushing. 
Apparatus for the cleaning of air ducts, comprising a 
pneumatic motor (1), a cleaning brush (3) mounted on a rotatable 

shaft at its front end and a flexible working arm (6) attached 
to the rear end of the motor and enabling the brushing device to 

be moved in the direction of the motor shaft, characterized in 
that the apparatus is provided with at least one supporting and 

friction brush (2) fitted to support the soft cleaning brush (3). 
Apparatus for the cleaning of air ducts according to claim 3, 
characterized in that it has on either side of the cleaning 

brush, directly at each end of the cleaning brush (3), a supporting 
and friction brush (2) having a diameter smaller than 

that of the cleaning brush.
