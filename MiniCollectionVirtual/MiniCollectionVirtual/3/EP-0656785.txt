<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the inhibition of HIV
replication in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage which
employs Interleukin-4.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was initially
identified as the etiologic agent of the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1983. Much has been
learned subsequently about the structure and function of this
virus. In addition HIV has been shown to be harbored by
T helper lymphocytes and cells of monocyte/macrophage
lineage [Ho et al., New Engl. J. Med. 321(24):1621 (1989)]. The
average time interval between the acquisition of HIV infection
and the onset of AIDS is approximately 8 to 11 years [Lifson et
al., J. Infec. Dis. 158:1360 (1988)]. This long incubation period
suggests that HIV replication is at least partially restricted by
host factors.Mononuclear phagocytes play a prominent role in the
pathogenesis of AIDS. These cells are among the first to become
infected by HIV. They are also major reservoirs for virus in the
central nervous system, lungs and lymph nodes; potential
vectors for the spread of virus to different tissues within the
infected patient and between individuals; and major regulatory
cells that control the pace and intensity of disease progression
[Gendelman et al., AIDS 3:475 (1989)]. Host factors such as
Interferon (IFN) that affect viral replication within the
mononuclear phagocyte are likely to be major elements in the
establishment of restricted virus growth and the delay of HIV
disease. The fact that macrophages are the major virus reservoir in the
central nervous system, the lungs, and lymph nodes suggests that
therapies that inhibit viral replication in these particular cells may
have a major impact on virus burden and disease progression
[Gendelman et al., J. Immunol 145:2669 (1990)].Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a lymphokine that has properties
that exemplify many of the characteristics of the set of immune
recognition-induced lymphokines [Paul, Blood 77(9):1859 (1991)].
IL-4 is principally responsible for the production of IgE in mice in
response to a variety of stimuli that elicit Ig class switching to the
expression of this Ig class [Finkelman et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 8:303
(1990)]. IL-4 was initially described based on its ability to enhance
DNA synthesis by purified resting mouse B lymphocytes stimulated with
anti-IgM antibodies [Howard et al., J. Exp. Immunol. 155:914 (1982)].IL-4 has also been shown to act on resting B cells to induce
expression of class II MHC molecules [Noelle et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 81:6149 (1984)], and to
