<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel D-glucosamine 
derivative which has a leukocyte-increasing activity and an 
infection-preventing activity, processes for preparing the 
same and a synthetic intermediate thereof. It has been known that leukocytes in a living body, particularly 
neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes have a 
preventing activity against bacterial or fungal infection, 
anti-tumor activity or an extensive immunological activity 
with a wide spectrum by enhancing functions thereof. As a compound having such an activity, particularly an 
infection-preventing activity, there has been known, for 
example, a compound in which a group at i-position of a 
saccharide is substituted by an N-acyl-N-alkylamino group 
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 40036/1989) and also a 
compound in which groups at 1-position and 2-position of a 
saccharide are each substituted by an N-acyl-N-alkylamino 
group (Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 
293991/1986 and No. 311093/1989).  On the other hand, methyl 6-deoxy-2,3-di-O-methyl-6-methylacetamido-α-D-glucopyranoside 
is disclosed in "Carbohydrate 
Research", Vol. 45, pp. 65 to 72 (1975), and also methyl 2-N-methylacetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranoside 
is disclosed in 
"The Journal of Biochemistry (J. Biochem.), Vol. 78, p. 679 
(1975), but no pharmacological activities of said compounds 
are disclosed. The present invention is to provide a novel compound having 
an excellent infection-preventing activity based on a 
leukocyte-increasing activity. The D-glucosamine derivative of the present invention is 
represented by the formula (I): 
   wherein (1) X is a group represented by the formula: 
   and R¹ and R² are each hydrogen atoms; or
