<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to electrolytic cells, and more particularly to
an improved electrolytic cell for electrolysis of water and the production of heat.The present invention utilizes microspheres formed of non-metallic beads
which are plated with a uniformly thick coating of palladium or another metal which will form hydrides in the presence of hydrogen. Palladium
coated microspheres are taught in my previous U.S. patent 4,943,355 and
5,036,031. In these above-recited previous patents
cross linked polymer microspheres having a plating of
palladium are taught to exhibit improvements in the absorption of hydrogen.The use of a palladium sheet to form one electrode within an electrolytic
cell to produce excess heat, the electrolytic cell being a Pons-Fleischmann-type
is taught by Edmund Storms. The description of the Storms electrolytic cell and
his experimental performance results are described in an article entitled
Measurements of Excess Heat from a Pons-Fleischmann-Type Electrolytic Cell
Using Palladium Sheet appearing in Fusion Technology, Volume 3, Mar. 1993.
In a previous article, Storms reviewed experimental observations about
electrolytic cells for producing heat in an article entitled "Review of Experimental
Observations About the Cold Fusion Effect" FUSION TECHNOLOGY, Vol. 20,
Dec. 1991.None of the previously reported experimental results or other prior art
devices known to applicant have utilized palladium coated (or other metals
which will form "metallic hydrides" in the presence of hydrogen) non-conductive
microspheres within an electrolytic cell for the production of heat and the
electrolysis of water into its hydrogen and oxygen components. The present
invention discloses various embodiments of palladium coated microspheres
within an electrolytic cell in conjunction with an electrolytic media containing
either water or heavy water, particularly deuterium oxide.This invention is directed to an electrolytic cell, a system and method
of electrolizing and heating a liquid electrolyte. The electrolytic cell
includes a non-conductive housing having an inlet and an outlet and spaced
apart first and second conductive foraminous grids connected within the
housing. A plurality of non-conductive microspheres each having an outer
conductive metallic surface thereon are positioned within the housing in
electrical contact with the first grid adjacent the inlet. An electric power source
may be operably connected across the first and second grids whereby electrical
current flows between the
