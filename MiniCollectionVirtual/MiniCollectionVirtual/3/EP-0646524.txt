<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ice-protection apparatus for an airfoil having a
polyurethane outer shell and a method for making same.The accumulation of ice on aircraft wings and other
structural members in flight is a danger that is well known. As used
herein, the term "structural members" is intended to refer to any
aircraft surface susceptible to icing during flight, including wings,
stabilizers, engine inlets, rotors, and so forth. Attempts have been
made since the earliest days of flight to over come the problem of ice
accumulation. While a variety of techniques have been proposed for
removing ice from aircraft during flight, these techniques have had
various drawbacks that have stimulated continued research activities.
Efforts to prevent and/or remove such accumulations of ice has
resulted in three generally universal approaches to remove accumulated
ice, a process known as deicing.One commonly employed method for deicing involves the
application of a chemical to all or part of an aircraft to depress
adhesion forces associated with ice accumulation upon the aircraft, or
to depress the freezing point of water collecting upon the surfaces of
the aircraft.Another commonly employed method for deicing is typically
termed mechanical deicing. In the principal commercial mechanical
deicing means, pneumatic deicing, the leading edge zone or wing or
strut component of an aircraft is covered with a plurality of
expandable, generally tube-like structures, inflatable employing a
pressurized fluid, typically air. Upon inflation, the tubular
structures tend to expand substantially the leading edge profile of
the wing or strut and crack ice accumulating thereon for dispersal
into the air stream passing over the aircraft component. Other
mechanical means for effecting deicing include electro mechanical
hammering, such as that described in U.S.-A-3,549,964 to Levin et
al., U.S.-A-4,690,353 to Haslim et al., U.S.-A-4,875,644 to
Adams et al., and U.S.-A-4,706,911 to Brisco et al..Another common approach for deicing is thermal deicing,
wherein the portions of the aircraft that meet and break the air
stream impinging on the aircraft are heated to prevent the formation 
of ice or to loosen accumulated ice. The loosened ice is blown from
the structural members by the air stream passing over the aircraft.In one form of thermal deicing, heating is accomplished by
placing electro-thermal pads having heating elements over the leading
edges of the aircraft, or by incorporating heating elements into the
structural
