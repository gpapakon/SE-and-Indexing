<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to N-(substituted
amino)pyrrole derivatives, production process thereof, and
herbicidal compositions containing the derivatives as
active ingredients.Regarding herbicidal compounds having an
(azinylureylene)sulfonyl group such as a {[(pyrimidin-2-yl-
or 1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)aminocarbonyl]aminosulfonyl} group, a
variety of compounds has heretofore been reported. For
example, there are following reports regarding atoms to
which an (azinylureylene)sulfonyl group is attached.U.S. Patent 4,169,719: Carbon atoms in a
nonsubstituted of substituted benzene ring.EP-A-51466: α-Carbon atom in the unsubstituted of
substituted toluene.U.S. Patent 4,473,394: Carbon atom in the
unsubstituted of substituted pyrrole ring. GB 2,015,503 and EP-A-98569: Oxygen atom of hydroxyl
group in unsubstituted of substituted phenols.EP-A-61661: Oxygen atom of hydroxyl group in
unsubstituted of substituted alcohols.EP-A-131258: Nitrogen atom of the alkanesulfonamide
group or alkoxyamino group.GB 2,113,217: Nitrogen atom of the amino group in
substituted anilines or 1-aminoindanes.GB 2,110,689: Nitrogen atom in the ring of
pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine,thiomorpholine or 1,3-thiazolidine.Among herbicidal compounds described in the above
patent publications, compounds having an
(azinylureylene)sulfonyl group such as a {[(pyrimidin-2-yl-
or 1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)aminocarbonyl]aminosulfonyl} group on
a nitrogen atom of the nitrogen containing heterocyclic
ring have been known (GB 2,110,689), but compounds having
an (azinylureylene)sulfonyl group which is attached to a
nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring through another nitrogen
atom have not been known.By the way, there have conventionally been strong
demands for herbicides capable of exhibiting reliable
herbicidal activity even at such low application dosages as
bringing about the advantage of reducing the amount present
in the environnment, herbicides capable of exhibiting
selectivity between crops and weeds irrespective of 
variations in environmental conditions, herbicides free
from crop injury to the second crop in double cropping,
etc. The present invention has been completed with a view
toward meeting such demands.The present inventors have found that compounds
having an (azinylureylene)sulfonyl group which bonds to a
nitrogen atom of pyrrole ring through another nitrogen atom
have excellent herbicidal activity, leading to the
completion of the present invention.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to
provide novel compounds which show
