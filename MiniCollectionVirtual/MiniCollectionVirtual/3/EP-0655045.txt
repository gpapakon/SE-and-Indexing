<ABSTRACT>
Device having a first container (1) for one of the products, at least one second container (2) for at least one other product, both containers being assembled to be sealed relative to the exterior, while being capable of relative displacement, and sealing means (F) capable of isolating the first container from the second. Said sealing means (F) can be opened in response to a suitable relative displacement of the containers. The sealing means (F) comprise a sealing plate (22) linked to one of the containers and a closure partition (28) with a seat (29) for said sealing plate (22) linked to the other container. In the closed position, the sealing plate (22) is sealingly applied against the seat (29) while a suitable relative displacement of both containers shifts the plate (22) from the seat (29) and opens the sealing means.

<CLAIMS>
Device for keeping at least two products (A, B)

desired instant, especially at the moment of use, including: 

a first container (1, 201) for one of the 
products, 
at least one second container (2, 102, 302, 
402) for at least one other product, the two containers 

being assembled to be sealed relative to the exterior, 
whilst having a capability for relative displacement, 

this second container (2-402) being equipped with a cap 
(3) closed by a stopper (5) which can be broken or torn 

off, at the moment of use, to let the mixture out, 
and sealing means (F) able to keep the first 
container isolated from the second one, it being possible 

for these sealing means to be opened in response to an 
appropriate relative displacement of the containers, 

these sealing means comprising: 

a sealing piece (12, 212, 312, 412) consisting, 
on the one hand, of a peripheral skirt (13, 313, 413) 

able to surround the neck of the first container (1), 
this skirt including a hoop (18, 418) extending radially 

inwards and a cylindrical sleeve (20, 420) which extends 
from the hoop (18, 418) and which has an outside diameter 

smaller than that of the skirt (13, 413) and, on the 
other hand, a sealing plate (22) carried some distance 

from the hoop (18, 418), 
and a closure partition (28, 428) equipped with 
a seat (29) for the said sealing plate, connected to the 

second container, 
the assembly being such that, in the closed position, the 
sealing plate (22) is applied in a sealed manner against 

the seat (29), whereas an appropriate relative displacement 
of the two containers moves the plate (22) away from 

the seat (29) and opens the sealing means, the translational 
displacement between the two containers, able to 

cause the sealing means (F) to open, giving an increase 
in the internal volume of the assembly of the two  

 
containers, 
characterized in that
 the sleeve (20, 420) extends on the 
opposite side from the skirt (13, 413) starting from the 

hoop (18), that the closure partition (28, 428) constitutes 
a sort of hoop including, in its central region, an 

opening forming a seat (29) for the sealing plate (22), 
that a cylindrical sealing skirt (31, 431) extends 

downwards from the lower face of the partition (28, 428) 
in order to interact with the abovementioned cylindrical 

sleeve (20, 420), an annular passage lying between the 
edge (24) of the sealing plate (22) in the open position 

and the internal surface of the skirt (31, 431). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sealing plate (22) is situated beyond the upper 

edge of the sleeve (20, 420). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the closure partition (28, 428) is slightly 

frustoconical and its concavity points towards the first 
container (1). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the cross-sectional area (S1) of an 

opening (18
a
) delimited in the hoop (18) is substantially 
equal to the cross-sectional area (
S2) of the annular 
passage lying between the edge (24) of the sealing plate 

(22) in the open position and the internal surface of the 
skirt (31, 431) and is substantially equal to the passage 

cross-sectional area (S3) of the seat (29). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the sealing plate (22) is carried 

by at least two tabs (23) extending substantially in the 
axial direction of the containers, these tabs being 

secured, at their end remote from the sealing plate, to 
the base hoop (18, 418) including a central opening (18
a
, 
418
a
). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the sealing plate (22) has a frustoconical edge (24) 

able to interact with a corresponding frustoconical seat 
(29, 30). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in  
 

that the sealing plate (522) is equipped, on its upper 
face, with a projecting peripheral rib (51), whereas the 

internal partition (528) is equipped, on its lower face, 
with a groove (52) whose cross-section complements the 

rib (51), which can be applied in a sealed manner into

container (2). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the helical ramps (17) are closed at their ends to
