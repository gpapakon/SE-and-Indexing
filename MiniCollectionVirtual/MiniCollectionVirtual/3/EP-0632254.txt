<ABSTRACT>
An instrument (40) comprises a pointer (10) 
including a pointer blade (12), a pointer cap (18) 

supporting the pointer blade (12) and a hub (20) 
integral with the cap (18) for securing the pointer 

(10) to an instrument, the pointer blade (12) being 
formed from a coloured transparent or translucent 

material containing fluorescent particles or pigment, 
for example a material known as "LISA" produced by 

Bayer. The instrument (40) also includes a light 
source (42) capable of emitting white or near white 

light which illuminates the pointer (10). The use of 
a coloured pointer blade (12) avoids light bleeding 

behind the cap (18) from being visible and the use of 
fluorescent particles or pigment ensures that the 

pointer is adequately illuminated and provides 
balanced illumination along the length of the pointer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
instrument including a fluorescent pointer. Known prior art pointers intended to be 
illuminated, for example for use in automotive 
applications, are generally moulded from either clear 
polycarbonate or acrylic material. These materials 
allow light to be transmitted through the length of 
the pointer via a pick-up prism located in the cap 
area of the pointer. If it is desired to give the 
pointer a colour, a layer of suitably coloured 
material is applied to the front or rear surface of 
the pointer blade by pad printing or hot foiling. 
When the pointer is given an amber, orange or red 
colour, a white coat of foil or paint is applied 
behind the colour coat. Prior art pointers of this type generally 
give adequate illumination with virtually any desired 
colour. However, the brightness of the pointer is 
limited and it is also difficult to produce a balanced 
light level along the entire length of the pointer 
blade. Furthermore, since the light reflected within 
the cap prism is substantially white due to the clear 
material used, light which seeps between the pointer 
cap and the surface of the instrument dial is visible, 
as a ring of white light around the pointer cap. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved instrument. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an instrument as 
specified in claim 1. It has previously been considered that 
pointer blades always had to be made of clear 
transparent materials in order to obtain sufficient 
illumination of the pointer and that the only way to 
provide a coloured pointer was by providing a coating  
 
on a surface of the pointer. However, the 
incorporation of fluorescent particles into the 
material of the pointer blade has enabled the use of 
pre-coloured translucent materials. It has been found 
that the fluorescent particles can compensate 
sufficiently for the loss of brightness caused by the 
coloured pigmentation of the pointer material and can 
provide a more balanced light level along 
substantially the entire length of the pointer blade. Additionally, it has been found that any 
light bleeding behind the pointer cap is much less 
visible than with prior art pointers, and with some 
colours of pointer blade this stray light is not 
visible. The use of a light source which emits light 
in the range of visible frequencies reduces the cost 
of the instrument and also its reliability. Preferably, the fluorescent particles have 
or the fluorescent pigment has edge
