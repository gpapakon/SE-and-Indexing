<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paper toweling which 
provides an improved combination of strength, bulk and 
absorbency while presenting an attractive appearance. This 
invention further relates to a paperlike web having perforate 
and non-perforate boss elements which are arranged to 
incorporate strength control while enhancing bulk. The 
invention further relates to single ply paper towels having 
areas of light bosses and heavy boss perforations which form 
islands of heavy boss perforations surrounded by intersecting 
bands of light bosses. Roll paper toweling such as that used in commercial, 
"away- from-home" dispensers, is a relatively modest product 
normally sold almost exclusively on the basis of cost as the 
purchaser is rarely the user. Accordingly, since improved 
performance can only rarely justify even a minimal increase 
in cost, techniques for improving the quality of this product 
must usually meet the most stringent of economic criteria, 
i.e., they can add nothing to the marginal cost of 
production. Roll paper toweling has been described in the 
state of the art for example US-A-4,191,609 and US-A-4,671,983. The advantages and purposes of the invention will be set 
forth in part in the description which follows and in part 
will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by 
practice of the invention. The advantages and purposes of 
the invention may be realized and attained by means of the 
instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out 
in the appended claims.  
 To achieve the advantages and in according with the 
purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described 
herein, the invention comprises: 
   a paperlike web of randomized cellulosic fibers having 
a basis weight of from about 13,0 (8) to about 97,6 g/m2 (60 lbs per 3000 sq ft 
ream), the web having a plurality of infundibulate bosses 
formed therethrough. The bosses fall into two classes, light 
and heavy, the light bosses being from about 0,05 (0.002) to 1,02 mm (0.040 
inch) less in height than the heavy. The heavy bosses should 
be perforate while the light bosses are preferably lightly 
perforate but need not be so to provide substantial benefit. 
The boss-perforations form an array of islands comprised 
primarily of a plurality of heavy boss- perforations 
surrounded by intersecting bands of light 
boss-perforations. In this specification, the term "boss" 
should be understood to comprehend all bosses whether 
perforate or not. In another aspect the invention comprises a single ply 
paper

infundibulate bosses formed therethrough; said bosses falling 
into light and heavy classes, the light bosses being from 

about 0.05 (0.002) to 1.02 mm (0.040 inch) less in height than the heavy, said 
heavy bosses being perforate, said bosses forming an array 

having islands comprised primarily of a plurality of heavy 
boss- perforations surrounded by intersecting bands of light 

bossses.

islands have from 7 to 12 bosses along each edge of the 

diamond. 
The web of claim 1, wherein said islands are 
separated from one another by a distance of from 5 to 12 

light bosses. 
The web of claim 3, wherein said diamond shaped 
islands are separated from one another by intersecting lines 

of light bosses which are from 2 to 10 bosses in width. 
The web of claim 1, wherein said heavy boss-perforations 
have a depth of from about 0,25 mm (0.010 inch) up to 

about 1,78 mm (0.070 inch). 
The web of claim 1, wherein the light and heavy 
boss-perforations are elongate hexagons. 
The web of claim 9, wherein the elongate hexagons 
have a base dimensions from about 1,91 mm (0.075 inch) in length to 

about 3,56 mm (0.140 inch) in length.  
  

 
The web of claim 9, wherein the elongate hexagons 
have a base dimension of from about 0,51 mm (0.020 inch) in width to 

about 1,52 mm (0.060 inch) in width. 
The web of claim 1, wherein both the base and the 
crown of the bosses are elongate hexagons joined by two 

relatively planar walls, the first sloping inward and upward 
at an angle between about 60° and 85°, and the other sloping 

inward and upward at an angle between about 70° and 87°, 
measured from the plane of the hexagonal base. 
The web of claim 9, wherein the bosses are arranged 
in staggered lines in which the bosses are aligned narrow end 

to narrow end. 
The web of claim 13, wherein the distance between 
adjacent tips of the bosses is from about 0,51 (0.020) to about 

1,40 mm (0.055 inch). 
The web of claim 1, wherein said web is a single 
ply product. 
The web of claim 1, wherein said web is a multiply
