<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an avalanche photodiode multilayer 
structure comprising an absorption layer for absorbing photons 

and subsequent generation of electron hole pairs, a field 
relaxation layer in contact with the absorption layer and a 

multiplication layer in contact with the field relaxation 
layer. The multiplication layer comprises a plurality of 

periods of first and second layers. The first layer has a 
first graded energy band gap being gradually widen in a 

direction toward which electrons are accelerated by a 
predetermined electric field. The second layer has a second 

graded energy band gap gradually narrowing in the direction. 
Both a conduction band edge and a valance band edge are free 

from any discontinuity and sloped down toward the direction 
through the first and second layers when the first and second 

layers are applied with the electric field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an avalanche photodiode having 
separate absorption and multiplication layers. Among the photodetectors, avalanche photodiodes are attractive 
as able to exhibit a high sensitivity and a high speed 
response. As could be well known, the most important factor 
for realizing a high sensitivity of the avalanche photodiode 
is the signal to noise ratio. The value of the signal to noise 
ratio depends upon an impact ionization rate in an avalanche 
region. Realizing a high sensitivity of the avalanche 
photodiode requires a high impact ionization rate. Avalanche 
photodiodes made of compound semiconductors including Ge or 
avalanche photodiodes having InP/InGaAs heterostructure have 
been practiced. The signal to noise ratios of the above 
conventional avalanche photodiodes are approximately 1 to 3  
 
only. Much more high impact ionization rate is seriously 
required to obtain a much higher sensitivity of the avalanche 
photodiode. In the prior arts, it has been known to enhance the impact 
ionization rate of the avalanche region in the avalanche 
photodiode by providing a superlattice structure therein so 
that electrons are allowed to be accelerated in traveling from 
a barrier layer into a quantum well layer. The electrons may 
receive an energy corresponding to a conduction band gap 
discontinuity when traveling from a barrier layer into a 
quantum well layer. The accelerated electrons may contribute 
an improvement in the impact ionization rate. One of the 
conventional superlattice avalanche photodiodes is disclosed 
in Electronics Letters 5th June 1980 Vol. 16 No. 12 pp. 467-469. 
Another type of the conventional superlattice avalanche 
photodiodes is also disclosed in Applied Physics Letters Vol. 
47(6), September 1985, pp. 597-599. A result of the 
measurement of the impact ionization rate was reported by 
Kagawa et al. in Applied Physics Letters Vol. 55, 1989, pp. 
993-995. In the above publications, it was reported that the 
superlattice structure such as InGaAs/InAlAs is able to 
contribute an improvement in the impact ionization rate rather 
than a bulk structure. Such the conventional avalanche photodiodes having the  
 
superlattice structure in the avalanche region are however 
engaged with serious issues as described below. The 
superlattice structure in the avalanche region involved in the 
conventional avalanche photodiode has a step-like energy band 
gap profile or energy band gap discontinuities at interfaces 
of the well layers and the barrier layers. As
