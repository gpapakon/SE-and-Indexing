<ABSTRACT>
A fabrication chuck (100) for applying a thin membrane (105) to the 
irregularly-shaped surface (112) of a workpiece (110) includes a 

foundation (120) 
adapted to hold the workpiece (110) in a selected fabrication position 

and 
an upper chuck assembly (160) adapted to be fastened to the foundation 

(120). 
The upper chuck assembly (160) includes an applicator (170) that is 

moveably 
mounted so that it can be displaced towards the workpiece (110) in the 

assembly chamber. The applicator (170) has a mating surface (176) and is 
adapted to selectively retain the thin membrane (105) on the mating 

surface (176) 
until the applicator (170) is disposed in a position so that the thin 

membrane (105) 
can be released and deposited in a desired position on the 

workpiece (110). The foundation (120) is adapted to generate a 
differential 

pressure across the workpiece (110) and the thin membrane (105) so as 
to draw 

the thin membrane (105) down over the workpiece so that it is in 
conformal contact with the irregularly-shaped surface (112).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fabrication chuck
for applying a thin membrane to an irregularly-shaped
surface of a workpiece.This application is related to EP-A-0,633,124,
filed concurrently herewith.In a number of devices, such as radiation imagers, it is
desirable to apply a thin membrane to an irregularly shaped surface.
For example, in a radiation imager in which a scintillator is optically
coupled to a photosensor, it is desirable to apply a layer of reflective
material to the surface of the scintillator opposite the surface adjoining
the photodetector so that optical photons generated in the scintillator
are reflected towards the photosensor. Commonly, one surface of the
scintillator is irregularly shaped, that is, protrusions extend from the
surface so that the surface is not flat Such protrusions are needle or
pyramid-like structures that result from the deposition process and
serve to localize detection of photons generated in the array to the
area in which the incident radiation was absorbed in the scintillator.Application of reflective coatings to the irregular surface
of the scintillator poses a number of difficulties. Many scintillator
materials, such as cesium iodide, have large thermal expansion
coefficients and thus are extremely sensitive to processes in which a 
reflective coating is deposited onto the surface, such as by sputtering.
The relatively high temperatures associated with such deposition
processes (e.g., above about 300° - 400°C) cause cracks in the
scintillator material that create optical discontinuities and thus
degrade scintillator performance.For example, a reflective coating on a scintillator surface
desirably significantly increases the number of optical photons
detected by the photosensor as compared with an arrangement in
which the scintillator has no reflective coating (e.g., an increase of at
least one-third or more in optical photons captured is desirable).
Further, the reflective coating should conform to the irregular shape of
the scintillator so that optical photons are directly coupled between
the reflective layer and the scintillator material, with few if any
interstitial voids between the scintillator material and the reflective
material. Additionally, the application of the reflective material should
not degrade the scintillator structure, either by thermally degrading
the material or mechanically deforming the needle or pyramid-like
structure of the scintillator. Reflective materials having the desired
optical and physical characteristics are available in
