<ABSTRACT>
Containers 19 for materials which are to be microwave 
heated, such as in digesting or extracting operations, are 

made of thermoplastic material, such as a fluoropolymer, 
e.g., TEFLON® PFA, that is strengthened by reinforcing means 

that may be a fiber reinforced theremoplastic of high tensile 
strength, such as polyetherimide, e.g., ULTEM®, with 

reinforcing continuous fibers in a matrix of such thermoplastic, 
which fibers are preferably of glass or other heat 

resistant and microwave transmissive material. The containers 
19 may be strengthened by incorporating the fiber reinforced 

thermoplastic in a wall or walls of the container or by 
inserting the container into a reinforcement 31, which is a 

sleeve or collar of the reinforced thermoplastic. In both 
such constructions the reinforcing means protects the 

container 19 against peripheral or radial failure due to 
pressure that is generated by the microwave heating of the 

container contents. Also described are processes for manufacturing 
the described reinforcing means and for utilizing 

containers protected by such means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pressure resistant reinforcing
means for containers that may be subjected to high internal
pressures during microwave heating of their contents. More
particularly, the invention relates to reinforced walls of
such containers and to reinforcements for the containers that
act as confining means or sleeves to prevent failures of the
container walls and burstings of the containers when the
internal pressures and temperatures of the containers are
raised, such as to 4.1 MPa (600 lbs./sq. in. or 42
kg./sq.cm.) and 204°C (400°F). In a broader sense the
invention relates to continuous fiber-reinforced tubular
structures that are comprised of a thermoplastic that is
reinforced against peripheral or radial failure by continuous
microwave transmissive fibers that are enclosed in a matrix
of the thermoplastic.It has been known in the art that plastics may be
reinforced by forming them about reinforcing fibrous
materials, such as glass fibers. Rocket engine parts, which
are subject to high temperatures and pressures and to
consequent strains in operation, have been formed of graphite
fiber reinforced thermosetting polymers, which fibers may be
in continuous yarn or weave form. Containers for materials
that are to be stored under pressure have been made from
fiberglass-reinforced polyesters and containers made from
plastics that are not so reinforced have been reinforced with
surrounding sleeves. In fiber-reinforced containers the
presence of the fibrous material has contributed strength to
the thermoset plastic matrix material.However, thermosetting plastics, such as phenolics,
polyesters, epoxies, silicones, alkyds, melamines and
diallyl-phthalates, are not microwave transmissive and
therefore are unsuitable for use as materials of construction
for containers that are to be subjected to microwave
radiation. In addition, containers for materials that are to 
be digested or extracted, utilizing microwave heating, often
should be resistant to attack by strong acids and organic
solvents.EP-A-0 416 759 discloses such a digestion container
comprising an inner liner made of polyfluoroethylene and an
outer casing made of polyetherimide. The outer casing may
also be made of others of the "engineering plastics", fiber
reinforced plastics, or other polymers known to be of good
strengths and transmissive of microwaves.It has been found by the present inventor that
fluoropolymers, such as those described in Chemical
Engineering for April, 1993, in an article beginning at page
163, which are melt
