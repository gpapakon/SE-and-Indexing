<ABSTRACT>
A device for fixedly interconnecting two parts (1, 2) of a clothes hanger comprises at least one cylindrical socket (3) on one part and at least one pin (4) on the other part to be inserted into the socket. The pin (4) has at least one portion (9) of a radial extent exceeding the radial extent of the socket. This portion is flexible in the direction of insertion of the pin for wedging the pin in the socket after insertion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for fixedly 
interconnecting two parts of a clothes hanger as defined in 
the preamble of claim 1 More particularly, the invention relates to a 
trouser crossbar to be fixedly connected to a clothes 
hanger as defined in the preamble of claim 2. Relevant 
background art is disclosed in US 4,046,293. Today the producers of clothes hangers aim at high 
flexibility. As an example, it may be mentioned that a 
clothes hanger is constructed with elements for receiving 
a trouser crossbar. The clothes hanger is supplied with 
or without a crossbar, as desired by the customer. Thus, 
it is important to be able to manufacture a standard 
clothes hanger which can be supplemented with the crossbar. 
Normally such supplementary mounting is effected in 
the factory, but there is nothing to prevent this from 
taking place in the garment factory or even in the clothing 
shop. There are different ways of constructing the hanger 
and the crossbar to permit this supplementary mounting. 
US 4,046,293 discloses a plastic clothes hanger with downwardly 
extending sockets on the lower side of the hanger. 
The sockets are formed with recesses in the inner wall for 
receiving a resilient tongue on the end of the crossbar, 
thereby locking the crossbar in the hanger. This design 
results in satisfactory strength and simple supplementary 
mounting but renders the manufacture of hanger and crossbar 
considerably more expensive owing to the complex 
moulds that are required for forming the recess in the 
socket. DE 26,24,805 discloses a clothes hanger with 
cylindrical sockets on the lower side of the hanger for 
receiving cylindrical pins in the ends of the crossbar. In 
this construction, the pins must be glued to the sockets  
 
in order to attain the requisite strength. Also this 
method makes the manufacture of the hanger more expensive, 
since the machine for making the hanger and crossbar must 
be fitted with components for the gluing operation. Moreover, 
the gluing operation causes environmental problems. The main object of the invention is to make the 
manufacture of clothes hangers, which consist of a 
plurality of parts assembled afterwards, less expensive. This object is achieved by means of a device of the 
type described above and having the features defined in the characterising 
clause of claim 1. According to another aspect this object is 
achieved by means of a trouser crossbar as defined above and having 
the features defined in the characterising clause of claim 2.

<CLAIMS>
Device for permanently interconnecting two 
parts (1, 2) of a clothes hanger, said device comprising 

at least one cylindrical socket (3) on one part and 
at least one pin (4) on the other part to be inserted in 

the socket, said pin (4) comprising at least one portion 
(9) of a radial extent exceeding the radial extent of the socket, 


characterised
 in that said portion (9) is adapted to flex, 
when the pin is inserted in the socket, towards the socket 

opening to such an extent that the pin is permanently 
wedged in the socket. 
Trouser crossbar to be permanently connected to 
a clothes hanger (1) via cylindrical sockets (3) on the 

hanger, said crossbar (2) having a pin (4) in each end 
to be inserted in the respective socket, 

said pin (4) comprising at least one portion (9) of a 
radial extent exceeding the radial extent of the socket, 


characterised
 in that said portion (9) is adapted 
to flex, when the pin is inserted in the socket, towards 

the socket opening to such an extent that the pin is 
permanently wedged in the socket. 
Trouser crossbar according to claim 2, 
characterised
 
in that said portion (9) is part of 

a radially oriented disc (7a, 7b) formed on a shaft (5). 
Trouser crossbar according to claim 3, 
characterised
 
in that said disc (7a, 7b) has a 

bevelled edge (8) at said portion (9), which facilitates 
the flexing of said portion and the wedging of said pin 

(4) in said socket (3).
