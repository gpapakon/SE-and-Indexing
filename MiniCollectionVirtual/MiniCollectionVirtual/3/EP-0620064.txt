<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a workpiece manipulating and
processing system as indicated in the preamble of claim 1.When handling and manipulating workpieces robots are
increasingly used in automated processing lines. One in the
field of increasing use of robots is the handling of molded
products, for example, made by injection molding of synthetic
resin or aluminum or other metals. Thus, it is necessary to
remove the runner and gate areas from the molded product after
same has been ejected from the mold. Usually, to remove the
runner the product removed from the mold cavity was struck with
a hammer manually and the shocks from the blows to the gate zone
where the runner is attached to the final product would cause it
to break so that the runner could be removed.In order to meet the increasing demand for automated production
it has be deliberated to perform the afore-indicated removal of
the runner from a molded product by machine rather than
manually. In conjunction herewith the use of a robot and of a
robot arm to hold either the product part or the runner part of
the molded product in the condition as it is removed from the
mold cavity and hammering the molding to remove the runner was
considered. However, as the shocks from the hammering in such an
arrangement would be transfered to the robot arm and put an
unnecessary vibrating load thereupon. Moreover, the shock effect
absorbing capacities of the arm would cause the removal
procedure to take longer than desired.Using a shock absorbing material between the product to be
subject to shocks for removing a part of it, such as a runner,
and the arm could be deliberated, but this would cause shaking
betweeen the product and the arm and would affect the accuracy
of positioning the workpiece (molded product to be further 
processed) to its proper position.Moreover, in view of using an automated vibrator device having
the hammer means for removing the runner it might be possible
to use a vibrator device driven by a pneumatic cylinder, so that
air pressure is used to make the hammer means collide with
the molded article in order to remove the runner, directing the
hammer means to the spot where the runner connects to the
molded product. In such a device the hammer would be positioned
at the end of a piston rod, the associated piston being moved
longitudinally by means of pressurized air alternately
introduced in front and behind the piston, triggering a
reciprocating movement of same so that the hammer means strikes
the molded product repeatedly. In such
