 SUBSTANCE THAT CAN STOP BLEEDING IN SURGICAL,MEDICAL AND DENTALUSES/SUBSTANCE POWDER 001 THAT CAN STOP BLEEDING DURING SURGERY,AFTER SURGERY, MEDECINE, DENTISTRY OR ANY BLEEDING DUE TO ANY CAUSESSPECIFICATION OF INVENTION(a) Title of the Invention.The substance powder 001 that can stop (stanch) bleeding in surgical, postsurgical , medical and dental uses or any bleeding due to any causes by topical administration or the substance powder 001 that has very potent hemoεtatic action can be administered topically to stop bleeding during surgery, after surgery, medicine by inqestion, dental surgery, extraction of teeth, and any injury or due to any causes for any normal and pathological ρpr«?nn«?.(b) Cross-References to Related Applications.The early literature on scurvy due to vitamin r riefioeπry wa reviewed by Bourne in 1944, he shoved hieroglyphs from Egypti papyri as convincing evidence that this disease, charaterized by bleeding gums and hemorrhages in the skin, existed about 3000 years ayo. Λ sudden pain seized their feet, and leys; immediately afterwards the gums and teeth were attacked by a sort of gangrene. The bones of the legs become horribly black. The legs shrivelled up and became covered with black spots. It as a sure sign of death when the nose began to bleed. ( Hourne, G,H, 1944, Proc. K. Spc. Me . , 37, 51? ) PΛTNΛIK 1971 stated that the concentration of ascorbic acid has been reported as decreaεingvith age in the rat eye lens, adrenal, brain, testis, and blood. ( Patnaik, B.K. 1971, Gerontologia , 17, 122 ) Purpura (extensive bruising ) and hemorrhages under the tongue are common in elderly people. Tattersal and Seville 1950 reported purpura in 60 out of 009 elderly patients admitted to hospital; the bruises were most commonly seen on the anterior aspects of their arms and fore- ornv. and on tr.e backs of their hands, noth p-it ientj. an7 the controls were ascorbate deficient, as ju ged by ascorr.:r acid loading tests; skin biopsies from those vith purσura sho ed degeneration of tne collagen fibres rf the derππs.

 (c) Background of the Invention.(1) THIS invention pertains to the field of disorder of hemσstasis, which is further classified into evaluation of hemostatic function, platelet disorders, coagulation factor disorders and thromboe bolic disorders. However, the blood coagulation mechanism of ascorbic acid which - was administered topically does not fall into either intrinsic or extrinsic pathway cascade, since it works the same for hemostaεiε in normal situation as in
