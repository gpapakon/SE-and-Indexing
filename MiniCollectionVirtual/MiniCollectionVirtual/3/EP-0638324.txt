<ABSTRACT>
A luer needle unit and an injector effectively 
prevent a user's fingers from being hurt when a disposable 

needle (1) is separated from the luer needle (2) after the use, 
while realizing simple and positive attachment of the luer 

needle (2) to a supporting cap (4). Guide protrusions and guide 
recesses are provided between the luer needle (2) and the 

supporting cap (4) to prevent the rotation thereof. Guiding 
projecting portions are formed in the supporting cap (4) to 

guide a needle part (3) of the luer needle (2) in the axial 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a luer
needle unit and an injector for medical use, and more
particularly to a luer needle unit used along with a
prefilled syringe, that is, a syringe having pharmaceutical
liquid preliminarily filled therein and which allows
setting of a disposable needle thereto, and an injector
using the luer needle unit.An injector of the aforementioned type has been
constructed in various kinds of structure. For example, in
an injector disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open
Publication No. 2-96149 (96149/1990), a luer needle is
preliminarily set to a supporting cap for supporting it
fitted at a mouth of a prefilled syringe. While a needle
part of the luer needle is held not to penetrate a sealing
cap of the syringe before the use, a disposable needle is
fixed at the outside of the luer needle and pressed
together with the luer needle to the syringe at the using
time, whereby the needle part pierces the sealing cap to
allow the pharmaceutical liquid in the syringe to flow out
through the needle part. In the constitution as above, since it is
necessary to rotate and pull out the disposable needle from
the syringe after the use in order to dispose of the
disposable needle, in some cases, the luer needle alike is
rotated and inadvertently taken out concurrently with the
disposable needle. The needle part of the pulled out luer
needle may hurt fingers or the like of a user. Moreover,
at the setting time of the luer needle to the supporting
cap after the supporting cap is fitted at the mouth of the
syringe, it may undesirably take place that the needle part
of the luer needle pierces the supporting cap due to the
absence of a guiding member for the needle part.
Therefore, it has been difficult to set the luer needle to
the supporting cap. AU-A-7 730 475 describes a needle assembly for a hypodermic
syringe. The syringe is prefilled with a pharmaceutical
liquid. The syringe cap is provided at the mouth of said
syringe. A ferrule is fitted at the mouth of said syringe. A
combined needle and hub assembly to which a disposable
needle is settable comprises one needle part which is held
in engagement with the ferrule at a use position where the
needle part pierces the syringe cap. The ferrule has a
flange portion a cylindrical guiding projecting portion
extending at one side of the flange portion and has a
through hole through which the needle part is penetrable. It
further comprises a cylindrical portion extending at the
other side of the flange portion to be fitted in the

A luer needle unit comprising:

a syringe (6) having pharmaceutical liquid filled therein
beforehand and a syringe cap (5) provided at the mouth of said

syringe (6),
a luer needle supporting cap (4) to be fitted at
the mouth (6a) of said syringe (6) and
a luer needle (2), to which a disposable needle (1) is settable,
having one needle part (3)

which is selectively held in engagement with the supporting
cap (4) at a non-use position where the needle part (3)

does not pierce said syringe cap (5) provided at the mouth
(6a) of the syringe (6) and at a use position where the

needle part (3) pierces said syringe cap (5),
wherein the supporting cap (4) him a flange
portion (4f), a cylindrical guiding projecting portion (4g,

40g) extending at one side of the flange portion (4f) and
having a through hole (4c) through which the needle part

(3) is penetrable, and a cylindrical portion (4a) extending
at the other side of the flange portion (4f) to be fitted

in the mouth (6a) of the syringe (6), so that a fitting
portion (2h) of the luer needle (2) is fitted outside the

guiding projecting portion (4g, 40g) due to guidance of the
guiding projecting portion (4g, 40g),
wherein guide protrusions (2d) extend in the axial
direction of the syringe at one of the confronting surfaces of

the supporting cap (4) with the luer needle (2),
said guide protrusions (2d) being 

engaged with guide recesses (4k) formed at the other of the
confronting surfaces of the supporting cap (4) with the leur

needle (2) and also extending in the axial direction of the syringe, thereby
prohibiting relative rotation of the luer needle (2) relative to

the supporting cap (4) and guiding the engagement of the luer
needle (2) with the supporting cap (4) in the axial

direction of the syringe, and
wherein the distance (A) between the two use and non-use positions of the luer
needle (2) is not smaller than the

sum of the axial distance (t) between a front end (3c) and a
base end (3b) of a notch portion (3a) of the needle part

(3) of the luer needle (2) and the thickness (m) of the
syringe cap (5),
The luer needle unit as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the luer needle (2) has an engaging protrusion (4m)

extended in a direction orthogonal to the axial
direction of the syringe at one of the confronting surfaces of

the fitting portion (2h) with the supporting cap (4), while
at the other of the confronting surface of the fitting

portion (2h) on the supporting cap (4) two
engaging recesses (2e, 2f, 20e, 20f) are formed to be selectively

engaged by the engaging protrusion (4m) at the non-use
position and the use position.
The luer needle unit as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the supporting cap (4) is provided with a 

cylindrical outer guiding projecting portion (4b) which
defines along with the guiding projecting portion (4g, 40g)

a predetermined space (4h) to receive the fitting portion
(2h) of the luer needle (2) and which extends to one side from

the flange portion (4f) thereby to guide an outer
peripheral face of the fitting portion (2h) of the liner

needle (2).
An injector equipped with a luer needle unit
as claimed in any one of claims 1-3.
