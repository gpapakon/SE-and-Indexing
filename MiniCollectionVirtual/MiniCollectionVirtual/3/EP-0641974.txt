<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a tile stove in which masoned flues (III, IV, V) are adjacent to a masoned furnace chamber, the flues being led to a chimney connection (4), to achieve a fully automatic, economical and explosion-proof operation it is proposed to arrange in a wall of the furnace chamber a gas burner from which a nozzle tube (1) reaches into the furnace chamber (I) and that a blocking-off device be arranged at a point between the gas burner and the chimney connection (4), the blocking-off device largely preventing the through-flow of fresh air when the burner is stopped.

Basic tiled stove in which a masonry fire box (I) is 
connected masonry smoke gas flues (I - VII) which are 

fed to a chimney connection (4), characterised by the 
fact that in one wall of the fire box (I) there is a 

gas burner (2) from which a nozzle tube (1) projects 
into the fire box (I) so that at one point between the 

gas burner (2) and the chimney connection (4) there is 
a shut-off device (5) which almost totally prevents the 

passage of fresh air when the burner is not operating 
and so that the shut-off device (5) does not totally 

seal the full cross-section when in its "closed" 
position. 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 1, 
characterised by the fact that the shut-off device (5) 

is positioned in the immediate vicinity of the chimney 
connection (4). 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised by the fact that the shut-off device (5) 

is designed in the form of a flap which can be 
swivelled through one axis (6) and which is operated by 

a servo motor (7). 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 3, 
characterised by the fact that the area of the flap is 

slightly smaller than the cross section to be closed. 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 3, 
characterised by the fact that the area of the flap is 

the same as that of the cross section to be closed but 
the flap can only be swivelled until it leaves a 

passage cross section open. 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 4, 
characterised by the fact that the area of the flap is 

the same as that of the cross section to be closed and 
the flap itself leaves an opening. 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 1, 
characterised by the fact that a heating flap (10) is 

fitted which can be swivelled through one axis (11) and 
controlled by a servo motor using which an opening 

which connects the fire box (I) with the area of the 
last smoke gas flue (VII) before the chimney connection 

(4) can be shut off. 
Basic tiled stove as described in claim 7, 
characterised by the fact that an electronic controller 

(21) is fitted which is connected to a room thermostat 
(15), a temperature sensor (14) on the surface of the 

tiled stove, a temperature sensor (13) on the chimney 
connection (4), two servo motor (7, 12) for the shut-off 

device (5) and the heating flap (1) and the gas 
burner (2) by means of control lines (16 - 20). 
Operating the tiled stove described in claim 8,  
 

characterised by the fact that the controller (21) 
controls the servo motor (7) for the shut-off device 

(5) to move it to its "closed" position as soon as the 
gas burner (2) has been switched off and to move it 

into its "open" position before the gas burner (2) is 
lit. 
Operating the tiled stove described in claim 8, 
characterised by the fact that the controller (21) 

controls the servo motor (12) for the heating flap (10) 
to move the flap (10) to its "open" position when the 

gas burner (2) is lit and to move it into its "closed" 
position as soon as the temperature sensor (13) on the 

chimney connection (4) has reached a preset value for 
the flue gas temperature. 
Operating the tiled stove described in claim 8, 
characterised by the fact that the controller (21) 

lights the gas burner (2) when the temperature falls 
below a preset value for the temperature sensor (14) on 

the surface of the tiled stove and/or for the room 
thermostat (15) and that it shuts down the gas burner 

(2) as soon as a preset temperature for the temperature 
sensor (14) on the surface of the tiled stove is 

reached.
