<ABSTRACT>
A composite resin for use in dentistry contains a synthetic 
resin and an inorganic filler, in various forms such as a filling 

material for restoring carious tooth cavities or decayed teeth in 
the mouth; a bonding agent for dental crowns and bridges, a dental 

cement, or any other adhesive. Active elements of either ions or 
radicals having antimicrobial and microbicidal properties are 

implanted into at least one of the synthetic resin and the inorganic 
filler. A method for preparing such a composite resin is also 

provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite resin for use in 
dentistry, and a method for treating same to impart antimicrobial 
and microbicidal properties thereto. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a composite resin adapted for application to 
carious tooth cavities and decayed portions of teeth in the mouth, 
in various forms such as a filling material for restoring teeth, a 
bonding agent for dental crowns and bridges, a dental cement, or 
any other adhesive. In the following description, the term "active element" is used 
to refer an ion. A composite resin, in a form such as a filling material for 
tooth restoration, a bonding agent, an adhesive or the like, 
generally contains a rigid synthetic resin and an inorganic filler. 
In application thereof, at first the composite resin is filled in 
the portions in the mouth to be treated, and then hardened and 
bonded by means of a photochemical polymerization reaction using 
ultraviolet rays, or other chemical reaction. However, a composite resin of this type tends to corrode in the  
 
portions contacting the tooth and peel away from the surfaces of 
the tooth enamel or dentine, due to the attack or cariogenic 
bacteria and the like after use for an extended period. The 
mechanical strength of such composite resins per se may also be 
reduced. In addition, the color of the tooth may deteriorate due to the 
accretion ad corrosion of food remnants left on the tooth.

1991 & JP-A-30 20 203 (MIGIO SUGIMOTO) 29 January 1991 describes 
a dental treating material obtained by adding an inorganic 
microbial agent to a resin for forming dental protheses and a 
resin for filling carious teeth and kneading the resultant 
mixture. The antimicrobial agent is prepared by adding antimicrobial 
metal ions to a zeolite and kneading the obtained material 
with the resins. Patent Abstracts of Japan vo. 13, no. 569 (C-666) 15 December 
1989 & JP-A-12 38 508 (DENTARU KAGAKU KK) 22 September 1989 
describes a dental material composition containing a metal 
containing inorganic compound antimicrobial agent containing 
metallic ions in an inorganic substance such as zeolite. The 
metal containing inorganic compound antimicrobial agent is 
preferably dispersed into the composition in form of particles 
as fine as possible. FR-A-2 636 811 describes antimicrobial hydroxyapatite powders 
containing hydroxyapatite powder in metal ions which are absorbed 
on the hydroxyapatite powder. GB-A-0 118 701 describes
