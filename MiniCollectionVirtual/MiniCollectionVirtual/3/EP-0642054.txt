<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an illumination device for plate exposing apparatuses, in which, for the purpose of compensating light mountains (mountains of light, excess of light), in which black surfaces (15a) are arranged as light-compensating (light-balancing) devices on the white, diffusely reflecting rear wall (15) of the light cabinet (4). The black surfaces (15a) have the shape of trapeziums, the shorter base line of the trapezium not being straight but, while reducing the width of the trapezium, having the design of a partial circle, with the result that the remaining, straight-line end regions of the trapeziums form so-called flat humps and that furthermore the light gaps, arranged on the left and on the right, of the light cabinet are narrower than the light gaps arranged at the top and at the bottom.
