<ABSTRACT>
A hollow extruding die (1) for extruding a hollow section of 
a zinc-containing aluminum alloy is provided. The die (1) is 

protected from cracks and has an extended life, without 
requiring any substantial structural changes to the die (1). In 

the die mandrel (13) of the die a mandrel (13) is connected by bridges 
(19) with an outer cylindrical member (11). The bridges (19) 

have a tapered 
projection (23) facing toward the mandrel (13). A 3mm thick coating 

(25) composed of a nickel alloy is bonded on the surface of the 
projection (23) by padding the welding material. Instead of 

coating the bridges (119), a covering (125) can be attached to the 
surface of the bridges (119). To receive the covering (125), an engaging 

groove (127) extends from the root of the mandrel (113) and along the 
surface of the bridges (119) to the outer cylindrical member (111) of the 

die mandrel (101). The covering (125) is composed of the same steel 
material as that of the die (101) or of the nickel alloy. The 

covering (125) has a through hole (125b) for receiving the 
mandrel (113) formed 

on the base. At the opposite sides of the through hole (125b), the 
covering (125) has projecting portions that are disposed parallel 

to the mandrel and the covering is tapered along the bridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hollow extruder die for 
extruding an aluminum alloy containing zinc to form hollow 
sections having a square cylindrical, circular cylindrical, 
tubular or pipe configuration 
and to a method of protecting an extruding die from cracks. Conventionally, aluminum alloy is extruded through a 
die P1 as shown in Fig. 10A, to form a hollow section of 
aluminum alloy. The die P1 is a port-hole die provided with 
a die mandrel P2 shown by a solid line in Fig. 10B for 
forming a hole in the hollow section. A die cap P3 shown by 
a two-dot dashed line is provided, in combination with the die 
mandrel P2, for forming the peripheral portion of the hollow 
section. A mandrel P5 projects from a mandrel support P4 in the 
center of the die mandrel P2 of the die P1 for forming the 
hole in the hollow section. The die cap P3 has an inner 
surface P6 of an extruding hole for forming the peripheral 
portion of the hollow section. When the die mandrel P2 is 
assembled with the die cap P3, an extruding orifice P7 is 
defined by the tip of mandrel P5 and the inner surface P6. 
By forcing the extruding material through the orifice P7, the 
hollow section is extruded. When the hollow section of aluminum alloy is extruded  
 
from the die P1, an output of at least 10 tons per die is 
generally achieved. When 7000 series Al-Zn-Mg alloy 
(according to Japanese Industrial Standards) or other zinc-containing 
aluminum alloy is extruded, however, the die P1 
provides an output of less than 1 ton per die. Moreover, 
when extruding a zinc alloy, the conventional die P1 has a 
short useful life and provides little productivity as a tool. The conventional die P1 partially cracks during the 
extrusion. Bridges P8 shown in Fig. 10A adjacent to the root 
portion "a" of support P4 of mandrel P5 are especially easily 
cracked due to the stress concentrations at the root 
portion "a" shown in Fig. 10B under the extruding load. Others have attempted to reduce the concentrated stress 
by modifying the structure of the die P1. However, this 
merely complicates the structure of die P1 and increases the 
difficulty and expense in processing and assembling the die. 
Since increased precision in the dimensions and configuration 
of the extruded section is continually demanded by the 
industry, modifications of the die structure is not a 
satisfactory solution for providing the necessary reduction 
in concentrated stress. Furthermore, as the structure 
changes, the stress concentration merely shifts to another 
portion of
