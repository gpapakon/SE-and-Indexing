<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus includes a two-stage mixer comprising a first high 

shear mixer 12 and a record low shear mixer 14. Plaster 
slurry is formed in the first mixer; a portion 38 is laid on a 

first facing sheet 32, a portion 40 B is laid on a second facing 
sheet 36, and the remainder goes to the second mixer. In the 

second mixer, foam is added and the formed slurry is laid on the 
unfoamed slurry on the first facing sheet. The unfoamed slurry 

on the second facing sheet is brought onto the foamed slurry to 
form the product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a
multilayer plasterboard in which a core layer of the board has a
different density from the outer layers, and to apparatus
therefor.The manufacture of a multilayer gypsum plasterboard is
disclosed in US-A-2 940 505. This document discloses the
application of thin layers of gypsum plaster slurry to two paper
liners. A core layer of gypsum plaster slurry is applied to the
first slurry coated liner, and the second slurry coated liner is
brought onto the exposed surface of the core. A very
satisfactory bond between the liners and the plaster is said to
result, even without the use of starch or other adhesive. The
apparatus disclosed in US-A-2 940 505 includes three slurry
mixers, supplying gypsum slurry to the two paper liners and the
core respectively. In practice, this necessitates complex
control systems to ensure synchronicity between the mixes and to
ensure that each mixer supplies slurry at the correct rate. The
capital and running costs of such an arrangement are high
compared to a conventional plasterboard manufacturing line with
only one mixer.US-A-2 985 219 discloses the manufacture of plasterboard by
depositing foamed gypsum slurry on a moving cover sheet.
Relatively dense edge portions (relative to the rest of the
plasterboard) are formed by taking a portion of the foamed slurry
from the mixer and subjecting it to further mixing in a
supplemental mixer (12), considerably more intense than the
mixing in the main mixer. The supplemental mixing breaks down
the foam in the slurry, which is then directed to the edge
margins of the cover sheet to provide more dense, stronger edge 
margins.EP-A-0 613 764 forms part of the state of the art only by
virtue of Article 54(3) EPC. It discloses a two stage mixer in
which an initial gypsum slurry is formed under relatively high
shear conditions in a first mixing chamber, from where it is
passed into a second, relatively low shear, mixing chamber where
it is mixed with foam. The foamed slurry is taken from the
second mixing chamber and formed into plasterboard.According to the present invention there is provided a
method for making a multilayer set cementitious product
comprising:
(a) dispersing particulate cementitious material in a
liquid medium at a first shear to form a first slurry;(b) blending a first portion of the first slurry with foam
under conditions at a second shear lower than the said first
shear to form a second, foamed, slurry;(c) depositing a first layer of either a second portion of
the
