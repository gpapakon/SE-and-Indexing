<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of improving 
measurement precision in optical biosensor assays 
employing evanescent wave detection, to devices for use 
in such a method and to the use of such devices. Of the large variety of chemical and biochemical 
techniques used for analysis or assay, a particularly 
useful and sensitive one is an optical system employing 
the principles of internal reflection spectroscopy. 
Especially useful for immunoassays, such an optical 
system employs an optical waveguide, a portion of one 
surface of which generally carries an immobilised 
reagent, for example, a specific binding partner to the 
ligand to be assayed in the sample solution. A light 
beam directed into the waveguide will be totally 
internally reflected in the dense medium of the 
waveguide and will generate an electromagnetic waveform, 
known as the evanescent wave component at the surface of 
the waveguide. This component characteristically 
extends only a fraction of a wavelength across the 
interface between the waveguide and the sample solution. 
This penetration, however, is sufficient to permit 
substantial optical interaction between the evanescent 
wave component and entities close to or at the surface 
of the waveguide, and only minimal interaction with 
species in the bulk solution. Hence in the example of 
an immunoassay for a ligand where a specific binding 
partner to the ligand is immobilised onto the waveguide, 
the evanescent wave component will interact with this 
immobilised species and with any species complexed to  
 
it. By employing an optically labelled reagent in the 
assay which complexes with the immobilised species as a 
function of the amount of ligand present, the 
interaction of the evanescent wave component with this 
labelled reagent can be determined. Since there is only 
minimal interaction with the labelled reagent in the 
bulk solution, this then permits one to assay the ligand 
of interest. The two principal forms of optical 
detection which have been used are those based on the 
optical absorbance or fluorescence characteristics of 
the species to be measured i.e. Attenuated Total 
Reflection (ATR) and Total Internal Reflection 
Fluorescence (TIRF). Such techniques and their application to assays are 
described, for example, by I. Chabay in Analytical 
Chemistry, Vol. 54. No.9, (1982) and in EP-A-103426, and 
biosensors employing such techniques are described in, 
for example, Biosensors: fundamentals and applications, 
Eds. Turner, Karube and Wilson, pp. 655-678,

<CLAIMS>
A method of improving measurement precision in an 
optical biosensor assay for a ligand in a sample which 

comprises the steps of 

i) incubating the sample in contact with a surface 
("the measurement surface") which surface carries a 

directly or indirectly immobilised reagent ("the 
measurement reagent") appropriate to the assay technique 

employed and which surface additionally carries an 
amount of a directly or indirectly immobilised species 

("the reference reagent") which gives rise to a 
detectable signal ("the reference signal"), independent 

of the amount of ligand present in the sample, at the 
measurement surface, and prior to, during, or subsequent 

to the said incubation of the sample measuring the said 
reference signal by a method appropriate to the assay 

technique employed; 
ii) simultaneously with or sequentially to the said 
incubation of the sample in i) introducing one or more 

ancillary reagents appropriate to the assay technique 
employed whereby if ligand is present in the sample, a 

complex involving said measurement reagent and said 
ligand and/or said ancillary reagent(s) is formed giving 

rise to a detectable signal which is a first function 
of the amount of ligand (if any) present in the sample; and 
iii) subsequently monitoring the signal arising from the 
measurement surface ("the assay signal") by a method 

appropriate to the assay technique employed and,

surface(s)") onto each of which is immobilised a 

reagent ("the calibration reagent") appropriate to 
the assay technique employed, the calibration 

reagent either being such to give rise to a zero or 
non-zero signal or being such as to form a complex 

involving said ligand and/or said ancillary 
reagent(s) whereby any such complex gives rise to a 

non-zero signal (or, where no such complex is 
formed, which would be formed if ligand were 

present), the signal being either a second function

present in the sample;

signal(s)") arising from the calibration 

surface(s); and
