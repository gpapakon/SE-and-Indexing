<ABSTRACT>
An ellipsometry cell is provided with a transparent lid (94) that is positioned close to a specimen (96) within the cell, thus allowing for a low volume wet chemical treatment of the specimen, and yet prevents interference with the ellipsometry measurements by partial reflections of a probe beam (106) off the outer (98, 100) and inner (104) lid surfaces. This is accomplished by configuring the lid to direct an ellipsometry beam (106) and reflections (108, 110, 112) thereof at different angles, so that the beam but not its reflections enter an ellipsometer analyzer (20). The lid preferably has an angled outer surface (98, 100) with beam entry and exit windows symmetrically tapering from a central ridge (102), and its inner surface (104) substantially flat and parallel to the cell base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the ellipsometric analysis 
of samples enclosed within a small cell, and more particularly 
to a window structure for the cell that allows accurate 
ellipsometric measurements to be taken despite the 
presence of reflections from the window surfaces. Ellipsometry is an established nondestructive optical 
technique for characterizing the properties of surfaces and 
surface films, such as film thickness, refractive index, 
surface oxidation, surface reaction kinetics, catalysis, 
electrochemistry, corrosion, passivation and anodization. 
It is described for example in Spanier, "Ellipsometry - A 
Century Old New Technique", Industrial Research, September 
1975, pages 73-76. The technique involves directing an 
elliptically polarized light beam onto the surface of a 
sample to be analyzed, and detecting the beam reflected 
from the surface to determine changes in its polarization 
state; such changes correspond to the properties of the 
sample surface. Measurements are obtained for tan ψ, the 
change in the amplitude ratio of the parallel component to 
the perpendicular component of the light wave upon reflection, 
and Δ, the change in the phase difference between the 
parallel component and the perpendicular component of the  
 
light wave upon reflection. The quantities ψ and Δ are 
functions of the surface's optical constants, the wavelength 
of the light used, the angle of incidence, the optical 
constants of the ambient medium and, for a film covered 
surface, the thickness and optical constants of the film. 
ψ and Δ are both measured in degrees, and each different 
combination of these two quantities corresponds to a unique 
set of surface conditions. A conventional ellipsometric measurement system is 
illustrated in simplified form in FIG. 1. A laser 2 generates 
a beam 4 that is linearly polarized by a polarizer 6, 
with the linear polarization indicated by polarization vector 
8. The beam is typically oriented at about 70° to vertical, 
and passes through a compensator 10 that converts it 
to an elliptical polarization, as indicated by the polarization 
ellipse 12. The elliptically polarized beam is reflected off the 
surface of a sample 14, which is assumed in this illustration 
to be horizontal, and which is shown as having a surface 
film 16, and is transmitted through an aperture 18 to 
an analyzer 20. The analyzer is a high quality crystal 
polarizer that determines the plane of polarization of the 
reflected linearly polarized light. The process of reflection 
changes

An ellipsometry system having means for holding 
a sample to be ellipsometrically analyzed, means for 

directing an elliptically polarized beam onto said sample, 
and means for analyzing the beam reflected from the sample, 

comprising the provision of said 
sample holding means as: 


a housing for enclosing said sample, and 
entrance and exit windows for said housing that 
are substantially transparent to and partially reflect said 

beam, said windows being configured to direct said beam and 
window reflections at different angles so that said beam 

but not said window reflections enter said analyzing means.

outer surface tapers on each side from a ridge, the opposite 
sides of said ridge comprising said entrance and exit

at different angles from the analysis beam.

surface comprises a plurality of sections that are oriented 

at different respective angles relative to the base.
