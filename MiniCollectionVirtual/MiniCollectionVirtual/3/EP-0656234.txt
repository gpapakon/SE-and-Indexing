<ABSTRACT>
Process for the biological treatment of solid waste and mud 
contaminated by oily residues. 

A pre-treatment step at 40-110°C by at least one extraction with a 
non-volatile organic solvent in a ratio 0.1-3 : 1 is performed to 

separate the oily phase from the solid residue. The emanating 
solid residue is washed with a 

supernatant liquid resulting from a bioxidation of the washing medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
biological treatment of mud and oily residues generated 
by the oil and petrolchemical industry. Materials of this kind arise from the storage of crude 
oil, intermediates and end-products of an oil origin, 
from refinery processing and accidental contamination 
of the ground with hydrocarbons. They are obtained in 
a great quantity. Recent estimations indicate about 2.5 
and 0.8 million tons per year of mud coming from the 
American and European refining industries respectively. Italian law classifies process mud arising from the 
storage of oil products as toxic and harmful waste and 
provides for their placement in third-category type C 
discharge grounds. American law (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) 
classifies mud generated by refineries as "dangerous" 
and has adopted a special classification thereof:  
 
tank bottoms for the storage of lead distillates 
(code EPA K 052); API separator mud (separating systems for oil-water-solids 
before water treatment plants, code EPA K 051); materials obtained from the air flotation of water-oil 
mixtures (code EPA K 048); water-oil emulsions (slop oil emulsion, code EPA K 
049); mud obtained from the cleaning of exchangers (code 
EPA K 050); primary mud obtained from water storage basins and 
water-oil separation plants (code EPA F 037); secondary mud coming from flotation plants and other 
equipment for the collection of water-oil waste (code 
EPA F 038). These materials can be disposed of by thermodestruction, 
landfilling or landfarming. If the latter disposal 
methods are used, American law (Hazardous and Solid 
Waste Amendments Act, HSWA 1984) imposes pre-treatment 
to reach the BDAT standards (Best Demonstrated Available 
Technology). These standards were promulgated by 
EPA at the end of the 80s' for K type mud and in 1992 
for F type mud. For the latter waste however the 
adoption of the BDTA limits was postponed until 1994. The limitations involved relate to the main aromatic  
 
polycyclic hydrocarbons (anthracene, benzoanthracene, 
benzopyrene, chrysene, naphthalene, phenanthrene and 
pyrene), the main heavy metals (chromium and nichel) 
and organic molecules with a high toxicity (benzene, 
ethyl and butylphthalate, ethylbenzene, phenol, toluene, 
xylene, cresols and cyanides). The impact of the adoption of these new standards on 
the American refining industry has been considerable. It has in fact been estimated that the costs of treating 
this waste, indicated at about 40 million dollars

<CLAIMS>
Process for the treatment of solid waste and mud 
contaminated by oily residues consisting of the following 

steps: 

(a) pre-treatment at 40-110°C by at least one 
extraction with a non-volatile organic solvent 

in a ratio 0.1-3:1 with the hydrocarbons 
to separate the oily phase from the solid 

residue; 
(b) washing of the solid residue resulting from 
step (a) with a supernatant liquid resulting 

from step (c) in a ratio 5-15:1 with said 
solid residue; 
(c) bioxidation of the washing medium using an 
oxidating hydrocarbon microbic mixture and a 

high producer of biosurfactant. 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that 
in step (a) the non-volatile organic solvent is used in 

a ratio 1:1. 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that 
in step (a) the pre-treatment is carried out by means 

of three extractions. 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that 
in step (a) the non-volatile organic solvent is gas 

oil.  
 
Process according to claims 1 to 4 characterized 
in that the washing step (b) is carried out in continuous 

using a supernatant liquid resulting from step 
(c). 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the washing of step (b) can be carried out with the 

culture broth as such.
