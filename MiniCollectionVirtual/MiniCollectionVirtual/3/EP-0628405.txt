<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a succession of self-adhesive 
labels on a length of a release material, the method 

comprising the steps of: (a) providing a length of release 
material carrying a succession of self-adhesive supports 

which are coated on their rear surface with a 
pressure-sensitive adhesive; (b) providing a length of 

laminar material; (c) disposing a succession of multilaminar 
label pieces between the laminar material and the 

self-adhesive supports, the laminar material being adhered 
by an adhesive layer to the self-adhesive supports and to 

the release material; (d) cutting through the length of 
laminar material as far as the release material thereby to 

form a succession of self-adhesive labels on the release 
material, each self-adhesive label including a multilaminar 

label piece carried on a respective self-adhesive support 
and a portion of the laminar material which is adhered to 

the upper surface of the self-adhesive support and to the 
release material on respective opposed sides of the 

multilaminar label piece; and (e) removing from the release 
material waste portions of the laminar material and the 

self-adhesive supports which surround the self-adhesive 
labels. The invention also provides a self-adhesive label 

carried on a release material, the label comprising a 
self-adhesive support which is coated on its rear surface 

with a pressure-sensitive adhesive and is releasably adhered 
to a release material, a multilaminar label piece which is 

carried on the support, and a laminar material which covers 
the multilaminar label piece and is adhered by an adhesive 

layer to the upper surface of the support and to the release 
material on respective opposed sides of the multilaminar 

label piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
labels and in particular to a method of producing a succession
of self-adhesive labels on a length of release material. The
present invention also relates to a self-adhesive label.In the packaging field there is a great demand for high
quality pre-printed labels for labelling containers of various
types. In order to facilitate the packaging and labelling of
containers at a fast rate it is generally required that the
labels to be attached to the containers be made available in a
form in which they are easy to handle and easy to transfer
onto the containers for which they are intended. In one
convenient arrangement the labels are self-adhesive labels
which are carried in series on a web of release material which
is wound into a reel. The Applicant's earlier GB-A-2199010
discloses a method of and apparatus for producing labels in
which self-adhesive labels are carried directly on a release
material.EP-A-0192444 discloses the features of the precharacterising
portion of claim 6.It is an aim of the present invention to provide an
improved method for producing labels which is a development of
the Applicant's earlier method.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of
producing a succession of self-adhesive labels on a length
of a release material, the method comprising the steps of:
(a) providing a length of release material carrying a
succession of self-adhesive supports which are coated on
their rear surface with a pressure-sensitive adhesive; (b)
providing a length of laminar material; (c) disposing a
succession of multilaminar label pieces between the laminar
material and the self-adhesive supports, the laminar
material being adhered by an adhesive layer to the
self-adhesive supports and to the release material; (d)
cutting through the length of laminar material as far as the 
release material thereby to form a succession of
self-adhesive labels on the release material, each
self-adhesive label including a multilaminar label piece
carried on a respective self-adhesive support and a portion
of the laminar material which is adhered to the upper
surface of the self-adhesive support and to the release
material on respective opposed sides of the multilaminar
label piece; and (e) removing from the release material
waste portions of the laminar material and the self-adhesive
supports which surround the self-adhesive labels.The present invention also provides a self-adhesive
label carried on a release material, the label comprising a
self-adhesive

A method of producing a succession of self-adhesive labels
(270) on a length of a release material (284), the method

comprising the steps of:

(a) providing a length of release material (284) carrying
a succession of self-adhesive supports (290) which are coated on

their rear surface with a pressure-sensitive adhesive;
(b) providing a length of laminar material (280);
(c) disposing a succession of multilaminar label pieces
(272) between the laminar material (280) and the self-adhesive

supports (290), the laminar material (280) being adhered by an

adhesive layer (286) to the self-adhesive supports (290) and to
the release material (284);
(d) cutting through the length of laminar material (280) as
far as the release material (284) thereby to form a succession

of self-adhesive labels (270) on the release material (284), each
self-adhesive label (284) including a multilaminar label piece

(272) carried on a respective self-adhesive support (290) and a
portion of the laminar material (280) which is adhered to the

upper surface of the self-adhesive support (290) and to the
release material (284) on respective opposed sides of the

multilaminar label piece (272); and
(e) removing from the release material (284) waste portions
of the laminar material (280) and the self-adhesive supports

(290) which surround the self-adhesive labels (270).
