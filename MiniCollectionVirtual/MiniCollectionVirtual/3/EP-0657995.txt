<ABSTRACT>
An output power stage composed of a pair of 
transistors driven in phase opposition and wherein the 

pull-up transistor is a PNP bipolar transistor and the 
push-down transistor is an n-channel FET has an 

outstandingly improved power handling capability per 
semiconductor area occupied, coupled with a large 

output voltage swing, without requiring the use of 
externally connected discrete boot-strap components. 

The "hybrid" output stage is fully complementary and 
the current-driven, bipolar, pull-up transistor may be 

driven through an auxiliary stage composed of a field 
effect transistor for substantially eliminating output 

power requisites of a signal amplification stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an output stage for
an integrated power amplifier particularly suited for
audio amplifiers.The document US-A-4,588,960 discloses a class B output stage specifically for a
low power, low voltage amplifier with particularly low quiescent power dissipation
and low cross-over distortion composed by a bipolar transistor and a field effect
transistor connected in series between power supply rails so that the input voltage
dead band is advantageously reduced. Most preferably the upper or high side range
of the out stage is realized with a bipolar junction NPN transistor and the lower or
low side range of the stage is realized with a p-channel field effect transistor.The document EP-A-0 349 954 discloses a voltage clamped differential to single
ended converter circuit, the output stage of which is composed of a MOS transistor
connected between an output node and ground and a current source is operatively
connected between the positive supply rail and the output node.The document US-A-5,028,881 discloses an operational transconductance amplifier
with differential output employing saturated MOS transistor in the lower branches of
the two output stages to improve linearity and dynamic range.The output stages of power amplifiers are normally
designed for maximizing the dynamic excursion of the
output voltage (output voltage swing), by reducing as
much as possible voltage drops due to the series
resistance of the active components (transistors) that
form the output stage. There is an ample specific
bibliography out of which the volume "Power Integrated
Circuit", published by Mc.Graw Hill, in 1986, pages
9.28 - 9.35 may be cited.A widely used technique in power output stages is
that of realizing a "bootstrap" line, using for this
purpose a relatively large capacitance, that may be
externally connected to the IC pins, in order to obtain
the maximum peak-to-peak variation of the output
voltage. Unfortunately, this technique conflicts with a
general IC design trend of eliminating or reducing the
need of passive external components to a minimum.The known configurations of a power output stage are
amply reported in literature and substantially are
those employing a pair of transistors operating in
phase opposition, namely an NPN/NPN, PNP/NPN, pMOS/nMOS
and nMOS/nMOS pair. Of course, the selection of one of
the above configurations depends on the fabrication
technology that is employed, which determines also the
maximum reverse voltage that can be withstood by the
devices (for example the
