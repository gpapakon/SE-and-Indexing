<ABSTRACT>
A transportable container (10) for carrying refrigerated products in frozen or refrigerated temperatures includes a structural container having an insulated outer shell with an access doorway (21). The upper portion of the container (10) includes a transverse perforated baffle (25) and positioned above the baffle (25) are a pair of spaced apart canisters (27, 28) containing liquid refrigerant. A gas or liquid feeder tube (32) penetrates each bottle (27, 28) and communicates with an on/off valve (30, 31). A feeder tube (32) can draw liquid to dispense for cooling, or it can release gas and pressure within the canister to boil the CO2. When CO2 reaches its boiling point, the canister (27, 28), its bracket, and the cold plate reach very cold temperatures to cool the cargo area. The gas is released through copper tubing over the cold plate to act as method for convection.

"PORTABLE SELF-CONTAINED COOLER/FREEZER FOR USE ON AIRPLANES, COMMON CA UNREFRIGERATED TRUCKS"SPECIFICATION This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/602,856, filed October 23, 1990, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 07/493,298, filed March 14, 1990, now U.S.Patent No. 4,991,402, which is a continuation of Serial No.343,025, filed April 24, 1989 (now abandoned) which is a continuation of Serial No. 119,702, filed November 12,1987, now U.S. Patent No. 4,825,666, all incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to refrigerated containers having self-contained refrigeration systems. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to an improved portable self-contained cooler/freezer apparatus wherein either an external bulk supply or self-contained carbon dioxide canister dispense C02 or like liquid coolant through a manifold and plate like diffuse system to regulate temperature within the container, and wherein a temperature controlled solenoid valve dispenses C02 or like coolant as needed into the container interior. The plate like diffuser allows use of the shipping container walls to cool.2. General BackgroundMany truck lines use refrigerated trucks to carry food products over long distances. Typically, such a truck is designed to carry either frozen foods or foods that must be maintained in higher, but still refrigerated temperatures, 

such as, for example, 40Â°F. These trucks typically carry either refrigerated or frozen food only and differ from the typical common carrier truck which is unrefrigerated and which carries any of a number of bulk, unrefrigerated commodities, such as palletized loads of any general merchandise, product, or equipment. Presently, there does not exist a means for carrying refrigerated and/or frozen food products over long distances of several hundred or even thousands of miles via common carrier, namely, with trucks that are not refrigerated but which have space for holding any number of general commodities.Several devices have been patented which have attempted to provide portable refrigeration devices. An example is U.S. Patent No. 3,633,381, entitled "Open-Cycle Portable Refrigerator." In that patent there is disclosed a portable refrigerator employing an open cycle system. A stored compressed gas, such as carbon dioxide is passed from the storage container through an evaporator which comprises a serpentine passageway for the gas
