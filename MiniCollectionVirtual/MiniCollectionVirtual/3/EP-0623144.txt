<DESCRIPTION>
Shock, which is induced by endotoxin, is
known as septic shock (SS). This condition is a iife-threatening
situation which occurs following infections
by Gram-negative bacteria as complication of surgery,
prolonged hospitalization, accidents and other
traumatic events. It is today well recognized that the
agent responsible for this disease is the bacterial
endotoxin, a glycolipid antigen present only on the
surface of Gram-negative bacteria. This glycolipid is
also known as lipo-poly saccharide (LPS) or lipo-oligosaccharide
(LOS) depending from the size of the
carbohydrate chain which is covalently bound to the
fatty-acid-rich moiety called Lipid A (LipA). Only
Lipid A is responsible of the major toxic effects shown
by endotoxin (LPS). Once endotoxin is released in the
blood-stream by bacteria, specialized cells of the
immune system like macrophages and monocytes are
activated by the endotoxin and several immune mediators
are released (Cytokines such as Interleukin-1 and
Interleukin-6; α- Tumor necrosis factor;
γ-Interferon). Furthermore, endotoxin also activates
the complement cascade which results in cell lysis with
the consequent release of proteolytic enzymes promoting
the release of vasoactive effectors from platelets
(e.g.: bradykinine and histamine). The final result is
death of the patient in 40-60% of the cases within 48-72
hours. So far, there has been no specific cure or
therapy available although bolus injections of adrenal
corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are used.Polymyxin "B" is known as a molecule that
binds and detoxifies bacterial endotoxins and can
prevent septic shock when given therapeutically in
animal models. However, Polymyxin "B" is a toxic
product in vitro and in vivo and this fact limits its
potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of 
septic shock.Septic shock can be caused by infection with
any bacteria that cause the release of LPS. These
bacteria include Pseudomonas aeroginosa,Escherichia
coli, Salmonella typhi,Neisseria meningitidis,
Neisseria gonorrheae, Bordetella pertussis, Klebsiella
pneumoniae and the like.The reasons leading to the reported toxicity
of Polymyxin B are not completely understood but they
are most likely related to the peculiarity of its amino
acid composition, specifically for the content of L α-γ
-, diamino butyric acid (DAB) (49.1% w/w of the
structure) which is an analog of the aa Lysine
(reported in literature as able to substitute Lysine in
the protein synthesis) and for the presence of D-Phenylalanine
an isomer of the
