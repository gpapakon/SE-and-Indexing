Device for thermally treating loose materials, such as 
earth, sand, sewage sludge, gravel and the like, comprising:
 
a reception device (12) for receiving the loose material 

(58);
 
a supply device (45) by which the loose material is substantially 

continuously supplied to the reception device;
 
a vibration producing device (4,5), connected to said reception 

device for producing a vibration motion thereof which 
moves the loose material in respect to this reception device; 

and
 
a burner device (35) arranged above said reception device and 

which directly fires and heats the materials to be treated,
 
characterized in
 
that the reception device has a surface arrangement, having 

at least one surface section inclined with respect to the 
horizontal,
 
that said vibration producing device (4, 5) is connected with 

said at least one surface section and produces a vibration 
motion thereof which moves the loose material along the inclination 

of said surface section, and
 
that said burner device (35) comprises at least one burner 

rail extending substantially transverse to the direction of 
movement of the loose materials, said bruner rail having a 

plurality of output openings for the burning substance directed 
substantially onto the surface arrangement.  

 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
surface arrangement of the reception device has at least two 

surface sections inclined with respect to the horizontal 
whereby the lower end of the first surface section seen in 

the direction of movement of the loose materials is arranged 
vertically over the beginning of the upper end of the second 

surface section in such a way that the loose materials moving 
on the first surface section reaches the second surface section 

from the said first section. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the surface arrangement of the reception is formed as a step 

plate whereby the transition from said at least first surface 
section to at least a second surface section takes place over 

a plate formed as a step, whose inclination to the horizontal 
is greater as the inclination of the first surface section 

and the second surface section, and is connected with said 
first and said second surface sections. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
at least three surface sections are provided arranged one after 

the other seen in the direction of movement of loose material. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
burner arrangement comprises at least 2, preferably 3 or 

more, burner rails. 
Device according to at least one of claims 2 to 5, characterised 
in that said burner arrangement and respectively 

said burner rail(s) are located in the transition extending 
betwen said at least first and said at least second surface 

section and/or one of the transition regions of the surface 
sections which follow thereafter. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the inclination of said surface sections  

 
with respect to the horizontal amount to between 5 and 15 degrees, 

preferably, between 9 and 11 degrees. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that said supply arrangement comprises a measuring 

drum, integrated with a stripping device and which extends 
substantially transverse to the direction of movement 

of said loose materials on the surface arrangement, whereby 
the said measuring drum has a cylindrical body having a plurality 

of plate sections provided thereon which extend parallel 
to the axis of the cylindrical body and form a respective 

chamber for receiving the loose materials. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
measuring drum can be driven at different speeds of rotation 

by means of a driving device. 
Device according to one of claims 8 or 9, characterized 
in that the supply arrangement has a hopper, and that said 

measuring drum is rotatably fixed in the region below said 
hopper. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the supply arrangement has a hopper arranged above 

the said surface arrangement. 
Device according to claim 11, characterized in that a 
first sensor is arranged in said hopper which outputs an 

electrical signal to a control device, when the hopper is 
filled to a predetermined maximum filled condition as well as 

a second sensor which outputs a signal to the control device 
when the filling condition of the loose materials in the hopper 

reaches a predetermined minimum value, and that the supply 
arrangement further comprises a conveying arrangement 

which is controlled by said control device in such a way that 
the filling condition of the loose materials in the hopper 

during operation is found to be between said predetermined 
minimum and said predetermined maximum value.  

 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that said vibrating producing device is 

electromagnetically operated and vibrates with a frequency 
between 25 and 100 Hz, preferably, between 45 and 55 Hz. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that said vibrating producing device comprises 

an unbalanced rotating body. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the reception device is made from a 

step plate formed as a single piece having side plates in order 
to prevent a sliding off of the loose materials transverse 

to the direction of movement, and that said step plate 
is fixed by means of supports onto a main body whereby said 

vibrating producing device is provided between said supportds 
and said main body. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that a control device is provided which controls 

the speed of rotation of said measuring drum and/or the 
power output of the burner arrangement. 
Device according to claim 16, characterised in that the 
control device is connected with temperature sensors which 

are located in said surface sections in the region of said 

burner arrangement and/or with an impulse transmitter for detecting 
the speed of rotation of the measuring drum. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 17, 
characterised in that said burner arrangement is operated 

with a gas-air or gas-oxygen-mixture. 
Use of the device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 18, for sterilizing earth.  

 
Use of the device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 18, for sterilizing sand from sand boxes as is used in 

childrens playing grounds and the like. 
Use of the device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 18, for drying sewage sludge. 
Use of the device according to at least one of claims 1 
to 18, for thermally decontaminating contaminated earth soil.
