<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of anti-theft 
devices and, more particularly, to improved vehicle anti-theft 
devices for attachment to a steering wheel of a vehicle 
to prevent unauthorized operation of the vehicle by limiting 
rotation of the steering wheel within the vehicle. United States Patents Des. 289,491 dated April 28, 
1987; Des. 306,252 dated February 27, 1990; 4,738,127 dated 
April 19, 1988; 4,856,308 dated August 15, 1989; 4,935,047 
dated June 19, 1990; and, 4,961,331 dated October 9, 1990 
are incorporated by reference herein and illustrate types of 
mechanical security devices which are a part of or can be 
used in conjunction with the present invention. The invention has particular application to preventing 
the increasing incidences of theft of vehicles by facilitating 
the ease of use and thus promoting the use of anti-theft 
devices attachable to a vehicle steering wheel to limit rotation 
thereof, and the invention will be described with 
particular reference thereto; however, the invention has 
broader applications which will become apparent upon the 
reading of the specification. Over the last several years, there has been a growing 
demand by vehicle owners to better secure their vehicles 
against theft when the vehicle is left unattended. Due to 
the increased crime rate, vehicle insurance premiums have 
increased with respect to vehicles not protected by an anti-theft 
device. In an effort to address these security 
problems, various industries have developed which manufacture 
and promote various mechanisms to deter the theft of a 
vehicle. Presently, there are a large number of anti-theft 
devices for motor vehicles on the market. In addition, many 
motor vehicles are provided from the factory with integrated  
 
security or theft prevention systems. Common vehicle security 
mechanisms include electronic devices such as alarms or 
so called "killer" switches which disable the engine and/or 
ignition of the vehicle unless bypassed by the authorized 
operator. Most of these security mechanisms which incorporate 
the use of alarms or "killer" switches employ complicated 
and sophisticated circuitry which requires professional 
installation and/or maintenance. In addition to the high 
cost of installing and maintaining these types of electronic 
security devices, the complexity of these systems prevents a 
typical motorist from deactivating the system in case of a 
malfunction of the security device. Mechanical security devices have also been developed 
such as
