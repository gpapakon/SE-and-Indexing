<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
diaminostilbene series compound that can be used in
photographic processing. The present invention also
relates to a method for forming an image using a silver
halide photographic material and a diaminostilbene series
compound. In particular, the present invention relates to
a photographic processing composition that does not bring
about crystallization during the storage of the
composition; and relates to a method for processing a
silver halide photographic material by using the
processing composition. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a method for forming an image that
can provide an image of high quality whose white
background is little colored.Silver halide photographic materials, such as
color photographic materials, including color negative
films and color prints, are generally processed by an
automatic processor that is operated according to running
processing in a photofinishing laboratory. The demand of 
the market is that results are to be returned to customers
in a short period of time. Therefore, processing steps
including the development processing step have been tried
to make easy and rapid.However, making the processing easy and rapid,
specifically, lowering the replenishment rate and
shortening the processing time, lead to problems of the
image formed, such as an increase in the minimum density
due to residual color and deterioration of preservability
of the image.Generally, silver halide color photographic
materials to be used for color negative films and color
prints have photosensitive layers of multilayer
constitution containing three types of silver halide
emulsions applied on a support. These silver halide
emulsions contain sensitizing dyes respectively so that
they may be spectrally sensitive to blue light, green
light, and red light.Generally, sensitizing dyes in photographic
materials are dissolved out in the processing steps, but,
if the processing time is shortened, the dissolving out of
sensitizing dyes is not carried out satisfactorily. As a
result, large amounts of sensitizing dyes left in the
photographic material make the image, particularly the
white background, colored, thereby making the image 
unacceptable for satisfactory appreciation. Therefore, a
processing composition and a method for forming an image
that can solve the problem caused by the residual color
are strongly demanded.To solve the problem, it is known that the
residual color due to sensitizing dyes can be lessened to
some extent by adding a
