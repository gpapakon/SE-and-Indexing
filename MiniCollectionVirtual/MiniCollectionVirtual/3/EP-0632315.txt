<ABSTRACT>
A camera, an apparatus, or a device applied 
thereto which uses an image recording medium cartridge 

having a cover for allowing an image recording medium 
to come out from or in the image recording medium 

cartridge, has determination means for determining at 
least one of a state wherein the cover of the cartridge 

loaded in the camera or apparatus allows entrance of 
light into the cartridge and a state wherein the cover 

of the cartridge clamps the image recording medium, and 
regulating means for regulating at least one of 

recording an image on the image recording medium and 
obtaining a print of an image recorded on the image 

recording medium in accordance with a determination 
result of the determination means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a camera using a
film cartridge with a movable light shielding door.A camera which takes a countermeasure against a
case wherein a film is unexpectedly exposed by
accidentally opening a back cover during a phototaking
operation has been proposed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 4-304437.Conventionally, a film feeding controller for a
camera is proposed. In this controller, a film is fed
by a first predetermined amount in response to a
patrone cover closing operation after a patrone is
loaded. Thereafter, when the patrone cover is opened
before the film is rewound, the film is wound up by a
second predetermined amount corresponding to a film
amount exposed by the patrone cover opening operation,
in response to a patrone cover closing operation.
Furthermore, when the film is wound up by the second
predetermined amount, a print inhibition signal is
recorded on the frames wound up at that time.However, the above-mentioned prior art does not
disclose at all a case wherein a film cartridge with a 
movable light shielding door for loading/unloading a
film is used.Document US 5 200 777 discloses a film cassette with
integrated cassette element lock and light blocking device
wherein the light blocking device is arranged for movement
to a light blocking position for preventing ambient light
from entering the film cassette and to a non-blocking
position. Furthermore, a locking means is provided for
normally engaging the cassette element in the form of a
film spool to prevent the movement of the cassette element.
The locking means is coupled with said light blocking means
and both means are united to form a single party When the
light blocking means is moved to the non-blocking position
the locking means is moved to a non-locking position
disengaged from the cassette element to allow movement of
the cassette element for use of the film cassette. The
cassette element is rotatably arranged in a cassette shell
and can only be used when the light blocking means is
shifted to its non-blocking position. On the other hand, a conventional camera which
uses a film cartridge with a movable light shielding
door for loading/unloading a film suffers the following
problems.
(1) When the movable light shielding door is
closed in a state wherein a film extends from the film
cartridge, the film is damaged, and thereafter, when a
phototaking operation is performed by opening the film
light shielding door again, an image is exposed on the
damaged film portion, and cannot be normally

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus which uses for performing a phototaking operation
an image recording medium cartridge (1) having a cover (4)

for allowing an image recording medium (5) to come out from
or in the image recording medium cartridge, 
characterised by
 comprising:

(A) determination means (10, S200, S300, S400) for
determining a state wherein the cover of the cartridge (1) inside the apparatus accidentally

clamps the image recording medium (5) causing a
damaged portion of the image recording medium (5); and
(B) regulating means (14, 103, S230, S231, S233, S234, S321,
S331; S332, S334, S335, S422, S436, S437, S439, S440, S441)

for regulating the recording of an image on the
image recording medium (5) by moving the image recording

medium so as to inhibit image recording on the damaged portion of the image
recording medium clamped by the cover (4) and

(5), for recording information on the magnetic recording portion of the image recording medium indicating an instruction of print inhibition for 
preventing the portion being clamped by the cover

(4) of the image recording medium (5)
from

being used in a print operation.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the apparatus comprises the
image recording medium (5) in the form of a film (5).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
determination means comprises means (10) for detecting

opening/closing of the cover of the cartridge (1).
An apparatus according to claim 3, further
comprising:

   means (S325, S326) for setting the cartridge (1) in a
used state when said determination means determines that

the cover (4) of the cartridge in the apparatus was opened.
An apparatus according to claim 3, further
comprising:

   means (S325, S326) for causing the cartridge (1) to
indicate a used state when said determination means

determines that the cover (4) of
the cartridge (1) was opened.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising:

   means (107, 108) for generating a warning in
accordance with said determination means.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising:
 
   means (S226, S327, S434) for causing the apparatus to

perform predefined different operations in accordance with said
determination means.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising:

   means for stopping a movement of the image recording
medium (5) in accordance with said determination means.
