<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for converting acetals to ethers. More particularly, this invention relates to a hydrogenation process for converting a 3-alkoxypropionaldehyde dialkyl acetal to the corresponding 1,3-dialkoxypropane in the presence of a supported hydrogenation catalyst. The process is highly selective towards the formation of the foregoing diethers relative to the formation of the corresponding alcohols, alkoxylated alcohols and mono-ethers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR CONVERTING ACETALS TO ETHERSThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 08/087,977, filed July 7, 1993. The disclosure in this application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.Technical Field The present invention relates to a process for converting acetals to ethers. More particularly, this invention relates to a hydrogenation process for converting a 3-alkoxypropionaldehyde dialkyl acetal to the corresponding 1,3-dialkoxypropane in the presence of a supported hydrogenation catalyst. The process is highly selective towards the formation of the foregoing diethers relative to the formation of the corresponding alcohols, alkoxylated alcohols and mono-ethers.Background of the Invention It is reported in "Acrolein", C W Smith, Editor, John Wiley & Sons (1962) at page 114 that the diethyl acetal of ethoxypropionaldehyde undergoes hydrogenolysis in the presence of Raney nickel to form the diethyl ether of 1,3-propanediol. The following equation is given:C2H5OCH2CH2CH(0C2H5)2 — ■> C2H5OCH2CH2CH2OC2H5 + C2H5OH US Patent 2,425,042 discloses tjie catalyzed reaction(R1θ)2C(R)CH(OR1)2 + 2H2 → R1OCH(R)CH2OR1 + 2R1OH wherein R is hydrogen or methyl and R^ is an alkyl, aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkenyloxyalkyl or alkoxy-polyalkenyloxy-alkyl radical. The reference indicates that the preferred catalyst is Raney nickel, although other hydrogenation catalysts such as copper- 

chromium oxide, platinum and palladium black can be used.US Patent 2,590598 discloses the catalytic hydrogenation reactionR"CH(OR' ) (CH2CH(OR) ]nCH2CH(OR)2 → R"CH(OR' ) [CH2CH(OR) ]nCH2CH2OR + ROH wherein each R represents the same or different hydrocarbon radicals chosen from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl and aralkyl radicals, and n is a whole number including 0 and generally less than 10. The reference indicates that Raney nickel is the preferred catalyst but "other metal hydrogenation catalyts (ie, platinum or palladium) or copper, chromium etc." can be used. A particular aspect of this disclosure is that there is no disclosure of the hydrogenation of a propane ether nor the use of a supported catalyst.US Patent 4,479,017 discloses the catalyzed hydrogenation reaction[R(YO)n]2C(R1)(R2) → RfYOJnCHfRiM ) wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkoxy group, Y represents an alkylene group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, n is a positive number of 1 to 6, the two groups R(YO)n may, together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, represent a 1,3-dioxolane ring, and R1 and
