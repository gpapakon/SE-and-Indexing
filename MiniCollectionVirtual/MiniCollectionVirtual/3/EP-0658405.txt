<ABSTRACT>
An industrial robot (7) is provided with a 
plurality of elements (8-12) articulated to each other, 

whose rotation is driven by respective electric motors 
(23, 39, 51) by means of reduction gear units which are 

integrated in the structure of these elements (8-12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to industrial robots 
of the type indicated in the pre-characterizing portion of 
Claim 1. A robot of this type is shown in US-A-4 585 387. According to the conventional art, the electric 
motors and the reduction gear units are separate units 
with respect to the structure of the various 
articulated elements of the robot, such units being 
mounted on these elements when the robot is assembled. 
This solution however is not fully satisfactory from 
the standpoint of simplicity of manufacture and 
assembling, since it requires in particular a number of 
adjustment operations to be carried out once the 
reduction gear units have been mounted onto the 
respective support structures, with a resulting 
increase in production costs. The object of the present invention is that of 
providing an industrial robot of the type specified at 
the beginning, which is particularly, but not 
exclusively, to be produced as a robot of small size, 
e.g. for carrying out arc-welding operations or for 
handling relatively light articles, having a very 
simple structure comprised of a reduced number of parts 
and that can be assembled with easy and quick 
operations. In order to achieve this object, the invention 
provides an industrial robot of the type indicated at  
 
the beginning, and further having the features indicated in the 
characterizing portion of Claim 1. Due to said features, the structure of the robot is 
greatly simplified and comprised of a very reduced 
number of parts. The operations for assembling the 
robot are simple and rapid, since the various parts of 
the reduction gear unit are supported directly by the 
structure of the respective elements of the robot and 
do not require adjustment of their position. The 
solution which provides for the use of pairs of 
straight gears is preferred (even if other solutions 
are also possible) from the standpoint of simplicity 
and economy of manufacture, simplicity in taking up 
plays and simplicity in assembling. It is further possible to provide for the use of 
reduction gear units identical to each other at various  
 
areas of the robot, so as to allow a certain degree of 
modularity in production.  
 Further features and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the description which follows 
with reference to the annexed drawings, given purely by 
way of non limiting example, in which: 
figure 1 is a perspective view of an 
embodiment of the robot according to the invention, figure 2 is a partial view, at an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Industrial robot, comprising a plurality of 
elements (8, 9, 10, 11, 12; 71, 10, 72) articulated to 

each other around respective articulation axes (1-6) 
and provided with a plurality of electric motors (23, 

39, 51, 58) for driving rotation of each articulated 
element of the robot around the respective articulation 

axis (1-6) and with a reduction gear unit interposed in 
the connection between each electric motor and the 

respective driven element, in which each reduction gear 
unit comprises a casing which supports an inner gear 

reduction transmission,
 
   wherein for at least some of said 

articulated elements of the robot (8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 
71, 10, 72), the respective reduction gear unit is 

integrated in the structure of the element of the 
robot, so that said structure constitutes the casing of 

the reduction gear unit and supports the gear 
transmission of the reduction gear unit, wherein
 
   each of said reduction gear units comprises an 

input shaft (23a, 39a, 51a, 61) and an output shaft 
(18, 35, 47, 12) rotatably mounted within the structure 

of the respective articulated element (20, 33, 11) and 
at least one pair of straight gears meshing with each 

other for connecting the input shaft to the output 
shaft according to a predetermined reduction ratio, wherein
 
   one of the articulated elements of the robot is an 

arm (10) having both ends articulated to further 
elements of the robot (9, 11; 71, 72) and with each end 

of said arm (10) there is associated an electric motor  
 

(39, 51) fixed to the structure (33) of the arm (10) 
and a reduction gear unit (40-45) integrated in the 

structure (33) of the arm, and comprising at least two 
gear pairs, characterized in 

that said robot comprises a base (8), a column (9) 
rotatably mounted around a first vertical axis (1) on 

the base (8), said arm (10) being rotatably mounted on 
the column (9) around a second horizontal axis (2), a fore-arm 

(11) rotatably mounted on said arm (10) around a 
third axis (3), parallel to said second axis (2), a 

stem (12) mounted on the extension of the fore-arm (11) 
and rotatable around a fourth axis (4), coincident with 

the longitudinal axis of the fore-arm (11) and a wrist 
mounted to the end of the stem (12) and articulated 

around a fifth and a sixth axes (5, 6) which are 
perpendicular to each other, and in that said reduction 

gear units (40-45; 53-56) associated with the ends of 
said arm (10) have output shafts (35, 47) which are rigidly 

connected to said column (9) and said fore-arm (11) respectively 
and each having a tubolar configuration defining a passa
ge 
through which electric supply cables of the robot are arranged.
