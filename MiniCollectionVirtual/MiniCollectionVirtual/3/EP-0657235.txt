<ABSTRACT>
A semi-solidified metal composition having an 
excellent workability is continuously produced by 

pouring molten metal into an upper part of a cooling 
agitation mold, agitating it while cooling to produce a 

slurry of solid-liquid mixed phase containing non-dendritic 
primary solid particles dispersed therein and 

discharging out the slurry from a lower part of the 
cooling agitation mold. In this case, a ratio of shear 

strain rate at a solid-liquid interface to 
solidification rate of molten metal is adjusted to a 

value exceeding 8000 in the cooling agitation mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for stably
and continuously producing a solid-liquid metal mixture
(hereinafter referred to as a semi-solidified metal
composition) having an excellent workability.As a means for continuously producing the semi-solidified
metal composition, there is well-known a
mechanical agitating process wherein molten metal is
charged at a certain temperature into a space between an
inner surface of a cylindrical cooling agitation vessel
and an agitator rotating at a high speed and vigorously
agitated while cooling and then the resulting semi-solidified
metal composition is continuously discharged
from the bottom of the vessel (hereinafter referred to
as an agitator rotating process) as disclosed, for
example, in JP-B-56-20944 (relating to an apparatus for
continuously forming alloys inclusive of non-dendritic
primary solid particles). Furthermore, there is also
well-known a process of using an electromagnetic force 
for the agitation of molten metal (hereinafter referred
to as an electrormagnetic agitating process).As disclosed in JP-A-4-238645 (relating to
process and apparatus for producing semi-solidified
metal composition, there is another process wherein
molten metal is charged into a space between a rotating
agitator composed of a cylindrical drum having a
horizontally rotating axis and a cooling ability and a
fixed wall member having a concave face along the outer
periphery of the agitator and a discharging force is
generated by shear strain at solid-liquid interface
produced through the rotation of the rotating agitator
while cooling to continuously discharge the semi-solidified
metal composition from a clearance at the
bottom (hereinafter referred to as a single roll
process).In all of the above processes, the solid phase
in the semi-solidified metal composition is formed by
vigorously agitating molten metal (generally molten
alloy) while cooling to convert dendrites produced in
the remaining liquid matrix into a spheroidal shape such
that dendritic branches are substantially eliminated or
reduced.As a working process for the thus obtained semi-solidified
metal composition, there are known a
thixoworking process wherein the semi-solidified metal 
composition is cooled and solidified and then reheated
to a semi-molten state, a rheoworking process wherein
the semi-solidified metal composition is supplied to a
working machine as it is, and so on.If it is intended to work the semi-solidified
metal composition by the thixoworking or rheoworking
process, the workability is
