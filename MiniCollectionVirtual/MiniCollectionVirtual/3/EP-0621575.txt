<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a decorative plastics 
article comprises the steps of receiving an 

in-moulding foil (10) with a decorative material 
(14,16) applied thereto, moulding a plastics body (31) 

and in-moulding the decorative material (14,16) from 
the foil (10) to the plastics body (31), applying an 

opaque layer (50) to the plastics body (31) covering 
the decorative material (14,16), and laser (42) 

trimming the opaque material (50) away from the 
decorative material (14,16) in pre-determined patterns 

to define graphic characters (16), wherein the 
decorative material (14,16) is applied to eliminate 

witness lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a decorative 
plastics article, such as trimplates and faceplates of 
the type commonly used in vehicle instrumentation 
panels and as vehicle radio and/or air control 
faceplates. One desirable design feature for a radio 
faceplate is back-lighting of the faceplate for 
night-time viewing. Typically, such faceplates 
comprise an opaque plastics body and a clear plastics 
cover moulded together. The opaque portion has 
windows or openings for light to travel from the rear 
of the device to the clear window to illuminate 
graphics applied on the clear window. One known method of applying graphics to the 
clear window is to silk screen patches of ink onto the 
clear window, to apply an opaque paint over the silk 
screened inks and then to laser trim away the opaque 
paint, thereby revealing the underlying silk screened 
inks in graphic patterns. One disadvantage to this 
approach is that when inks are silk screened onto the 
plastics cover and then painted over, there are 
witness lines visible through the paint around the 
edge of the silk screened ink. This is due to the 
fact that the ink is raised, compared to the remainder 
of the clear cover. Figure 1 illustrates in cross-section a 
prior art trimplate. Ink layer 15 is silk screened 
onto plastics body 11 and the entire front surface is 
covered with opaque layer 13. The opaque layer is 
selectively removed to form graphics patterns (not 
shown). Figure 1 illustrates the raised edges 17 of 
the opaque layer 13 caused by the ink 15 being applied 
on top of the plastics body 11. The raised edges 17  
 
visible to viewers of the display are known as 
"witness lines." Another known method of providing graphics 
on a trimplate is to apply the graphics to an appliqué 
and then to fit the appliqué to the trimplate. In 
this method, however, appliqué edges are visible and a 
bezel is required to hide the visible edges. Also, 
the use of appliqués is not suitable for curved 
bodies. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved decorative plastics article and a system for 
producing a decorative plastics article. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a decorative plastics 
article as specified in claim 1. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of producing a 
decorative plastics article as specified in claim 7. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a manufacturing system as 
specified in claim 11. This invention can

Decorative plastics article comprising a 
plastics body (31,33) with a first surface; a 

decorative material (14,16) moulded to the first 
surface; an opaque layer (50) covering the first 

surface and the decorative material, except in defined 
portions comprising graphic characters, wherein the 

decorative material substantially covers the first 
surface and the opaque layer is substantially smooth. 
Decorative plastics article according to 
claim 1, wherein the plastics body comprises first and 

second plastics portions (31,33), the first plastics 
portion (31) being formed from an opaque plastics 

material and the second plastics portion (32) being 
formed from a transparent or translucent plastics 

material. 
Display apparatus according to claim 2, 
wherein the opaque plastics portion (31) has formed 

therein openings (46) through which light can pass to 
back light the graphics characters. 
Decorative plastics article according to 
claim 2 or 3, wherein the opaque plastics portion (31) 

comprises openings (48) for receiving push-button 
switches (114). 
Decorative plastics article according to 
any preceding claim, wherein the decorative material 

comprises at least first and second ink portions 
(14,16), wherein the first ink portion (16) includes 

first edges substantially abutting edges of the second 
ink portion (14). 
Decorative plastics article according to 
any preceding claim, wherein the plastics body, the 

decorative material and/or the opaque layer are 
substantially flat or curved. 
A method of producing a decorative 
plastics article comprising the steps of applying a 

decorative material (14,16) to a moulding foil (10); 
moulding a plastics body (31) and moulding the 

decorative material from the foil to the plastics 
body, wherein the decorative material substantially 

covers a first surface of the plastics body; applying 
an opaque layer (50) to the plastics body covering the 

decorative material; and laser trimming the opaque 
material away from the decorative material in 

pre-determined patterns to form graphic characters. 
A method according to claim 7, 
comprising the steps of applying a hard coating layer 

(12) and a release layer (18) to the foil.

decorative material; and a third station (43) 

comprising trimming means (42) for trimming the opaque 
layer above the decorative material to form graphics 

characters (16).
