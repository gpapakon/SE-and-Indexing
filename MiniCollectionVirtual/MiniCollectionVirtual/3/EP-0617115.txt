<ABSTRACT>

The device comprises at least two substantially cylindrical components (1, 3), one fitting into the other, which bound an annular region (5) between them, means (6, 7) for introducing the mixture to be separated at the periphery of the external tubular component (1), arranged so as to impart a rotational motion to the mixture, means for applying between the two components (1, 3) a potential difference capable of causing the particles of the dispersed phase (II) to coalesce, means for receiving and for separation (4), means for removing (8, 9) the two phases (I) and (II) which are at least partially separated because of the differentiated motion of the particles which have coalesced, and means for establishing a circulation of the mixture.

A method for separating a mixture consisting of at
least one continuous phase (I) and at least one conductive

phase (II) dispersed in the continuous phase in the form of
particles such as drops, the densities of the two phases

being different from one another, in which the mixture to
be separated is fed into at least one annular zone (5),

said annular zone being delimited by at least two
substantially cylindrical parts (1, 3), one inserted inside

the other, a potential difference is applied between said
substantially cylindrical parts (1, 3) in order to create a

radial electric field in the annular zone (5),

characterised in that at the same time as the potential
difference is applied between the two cylindrical parts to

enhance the coalescence of particles of disperse phase
(II), the mixture is introduced at a tangent towards the

periphery of at least one of the substantially cylindrical
parts in order to impart a rotary motion to the fluid in

the annular zone and produce a centrifugal force which will
allow the coalesced particles to be at least partially

separated from the continuous phase under the effect of the
centrifugal force prevailing within the annular zone, the

continuous phase and the disperse phase containing the
coalesced particles being collected separately outside of

the annular zone.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the mixture is introduced at a tangent at the

periphery of at least one of the substantially cylindrical
parts.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the mixture to be separated is circulated in a

plurality of annular zones located between coaxial tubular
parts.
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that the mixture is injected into several annular zones

simultaneously. 
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that the mixture is successively circulated in different

annular zones.
A method as claimed in claim 5, characterised in
that the mixture to be separated is circulated in said

first annular zone (5) delimited by an external tubular
part (1) and an internal tubular part (3), said parts being

substantially coaxial, where it is subjected to a first
separation during which the partially coalesced particles

agglomerate at the periphery of the external tubular part
(1), the partially separated continuous phase passes into a

second annular zone, delimited by the tubular part (3) and
a central electrode, in an overall direction opposite to

the direction in which the mixture is being circulated in
the first zone (5), whilst the remaining particles which

coalesce whilst said partially separated phase is
circulated in the second annular zone agglomerate on the

internal wall of the tubular part (3) and the particles
that have coalesced on the internal walls of the external

tubular part (1) and the internal tubular part (3) drain
down to the lower part of the device whilst the continuous

phase is discharged through the passage 9.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6,

steps in series, each of these steps allowing a fraction of
the disperse phase (II) initially contained in the mixture

in the form of drops to be separated.
