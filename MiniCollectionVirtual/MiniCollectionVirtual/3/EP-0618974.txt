<DESCRIPTION>
 A method of cloning proteins in yeast and cellulase from Humicola insolens .FIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a method of screening for DNA sequences coding for proteins of interest, as well as to a process for producing such proteins of interest .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe advent of recombinant DNA techniques has made it possible to select single protein components with interesting properties and produce them on a large scale. This represents an improvement over the previously employed production process using microorganisms isolated from nature and producing a mixture of proteins which would either be used as such or separated after the production step. However, the conventional cloning techniques have the drawback that each protein component has to be purified and characterized by its (partial) amino acid sequence before it is possible to prepare synthetic oligonucleotide probes for hybridization experiments. Since this is a rather time-consuming process, the cloning of novel proteins might be considerably expedited by using a screening method involving selecting clones expressing a desired protein activity.Such a screening method has previously been devised for the cloning of prokaryotic gene products in Bacillus, cf.

Bacteriol. 156,1983, pp. 327-337; N. Tsukagoshi et al. , Mol. Gen. Genet. 193,1984, pp. 58-63; M. Sibakov and I. Palva, Eur. J. Bioche . 145, 1984, pp. 567-572; and J.R. Mielenz, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA {?(), 1983, pp. 5975-5979. A screening method based on expression cloning of eukaryotic genes in mammalian cells has been described, e.g. in D.P. Gearing et al., The EMBO J. 8., 1989, 

 pp. 3667-3676; N. Harada et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 1990, pp. 857-861; and R. Fukunaga et al., Cell 61, 1990, pp. 341-350.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt has now been found possible to screen for yeast clones expressing protein activities of interest with a view to isolating DNA coding for single protein components.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of screening for a DNA sequence coding for a protein of interest, the method comprising(a) cloning, in suitable vectors, a DNA library from an organism suspected of producing one or more proteins of interes ,(b) transforming suitable yeast host cells with said vectors,(c) culturing the host cells under suitable conditions to express
