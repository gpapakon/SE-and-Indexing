<ABSTRACT>
A polarization splitter comprises an optical waveguide 
formed on a substrate and having an S-shaped curve portion, 

for permitting propagation of two linearly polarized lights 
orthogonal to each other therethrough, and an anisotropic 

optical waveguide branching from the beginning of the S-shaped 
curve portion, into which is guided one of the two 

linearly polarized lights alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polarization splitter, and more
particularly to a polarization splitter of waveguide type
having an anisotropic optical waveguide.Lithium niobate LiNbOb3 is widely used as a material for
substrates of waveguide-type optical functional elements,
because of its large electro-optical effect and large
electromechanical coupling coefficient. An optical
waveguide using a substrate made of lithium niobate has
anisotropy in the refractive index, and therefore the
functional element using it operates in a manner dependent
on polarization. Therefore, an element is required for
splitting polarized lights (TE and TM lights).As a conventional polarization splitter, the following are
known. Fig. 1 is a plan view of a polarization splitter
described in Journal of Lightwave Technology Vol. 7, No.
10, pp 1567-1574, 1989. As shown in the figure, on a Z-cut
X axis-propagating lithium niobate substrate 21, there
is formed a Y branch optical waveguide which comprises a Ti
indiffusion (TI) optical waveguide 22 and a proton exchange
(PE) optical waveguide 23. The polarized lights (the TE
mode and the TM mode) are excited into respective higher-order
modes at a taper region extending in a tapered form
and comprised of two kinds of optical waveguides into which
the input waveguide is about to be bifurcated. The
higher-order modes excited propagate through the optical
waveguide with different field distributions due to the 
difference in the effective refractive indexes thereof
sensitive to the optical waveguide. Then, at the
bifurcating point, the higher order modes propagate into
respective optical waveguides different from each other,
since the higher modes of the polarized lights agree with
the fundamental modes of same in the optical waveguides,
respectively. That is, the TM mode propagates into the
branch of the proton exchange optical waveguide 23, and the
TE mode into the branch of the titanium indiffusion optical
waveguide 22, whereby a polarization splitting operation is
achieved.In the conventional polarization splitter element described
above, since the perturbation of the modes is utilized in
splitting the polarized lights, there are problems of (a):
the polarization-splitting characteristics are degraded for
a light with a wide range of wavelength since the
polarization-splitting ratio varies with the wavelength of
the light, and (b): a fabrication tolerance of the Y branch
is close or strict, since the polarization-splitting ratio
largely depends on a branching angle of the Y branch.A
