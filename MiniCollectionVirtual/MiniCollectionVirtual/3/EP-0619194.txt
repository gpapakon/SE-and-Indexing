<ABSTRACT>
A document file comprises a front cover 12 and a 
rear cover 14 connected together by a hinge 22, a side 

flap 20 connected to the rear cover by a hinge 26 and end 
flaps 16,18 connected to the rear cover by hinges 25. 

The side flap is connected in use to the end flaps by 
means of tongues 30,32 formed on the end flaps which 

protrude through slits 28 formed in the side flap. The 
inclination of the slits 28 permits relative sliding 

movement between the flaps to vary the capacity of the 
file. The front cover 12 can be slidably connected to 

the side flap 20 by engagement between tongues 38 on the 
front cover with recessed edges 36 formed in the side 

flap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a document file. Various methods are known for forming a document 
file which has a front cover and a rear cover provided 
with a pocket. In one method, the pocket is connected to 
the cover with a pair of gussets which allow the pocket to 
expand to vary the capacity of the file. Gusseting 
involves expensive tooling and a document file formed by 
this method cannot be stored totally flat. Further, a 
glueing or welding operation is required to fix the pocket 
in the file. In another method, the pocket is formed by 
two or more flaps which are not held together with a 
resulting loss of security in retaining documents in the 
file. In another file, a pocket is formed by a side flap 
and a pair of end flaps which are held in position by 
elastic bands when the file is closed. US-A-4109850 describes a document file having a 
front cover and a rear cover connected together by a first 
hinge such that the front cover can be folded to a closed 
position overlying the rear cover, a side flap connected 
to the rear cover by a second hinge and overlying the rear 
cover in use, and an end flap connected to the rear cover 
by a third hinge and overlying the rear cover in use. A 
T-shaped bar connected to the end flap is slidably 
connected to the side flap to hold the end flap and side 
flap in overlying relationship and to permit only limited 
relative sliding movement therebetween to vary the 
capacity of the file. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
new and improved document file. The present invention improves on the document 
file of US-A-4109850 by providing a pair of end flaps 
connected opposite one another to the rear cover by hinges 
and overlying the rear cover in use. Sliding connections 
are formed between the side flap and each of the end flaps  
 
to hold the two parts together in overlying relationship 
and to permit only limited relative sliding motion 
therebetween along a linear path to vary the capacity of 
the file. Each sliding connection is formed by a pair of 
oppositely directed tongues formed in one of the parts 
(side flap or end flap) and a pair of guide edges formed 
on the other part. The tongues hook over respective 
guide edges and can slide therelong to vary the capacity 
of the file. In a preferred embodiment the parallel guide 
edges of each sliding connection are provided by the edges 
of a slit formed in the side flap and each pair of 
oppositely directed tongues is formed on an end flap. 
The tongues of each pair protrude through the

A document file comprising a front cover (12) 
and a rear cover (14) connected together by a first hinge 

(22) such that the front cover can be folded to a closed 
position overlying the rear cover, a side flap (20) 

connected to the rear cover by a second hinge (26) and 
overlying the rear cover in use, and a pair of end flaps 

(16,18) connected opposite one another to the rear cover 
by third and fourth hinges (25) and overlying the rear 

cover in use; wherein sliding connections are formed 
between the side flap (20) and each of the end flaps 

(16,18) to hold the two parts together in overlying 
relationship and to permit only limited relative sliding 

movement therebetween along a linear path to vary the 
capacity of the file; and wherein each sliding connection 

is formed by a pair of oppositely directed tongues (30,32) 
formed in one of the parts and a pair of parallel guide 

edges (281,282) formed on the other part, and wherein the 
tongues (30,32) hook over respective guide edges (281,282) 

and can slide therealong to vary the capacity of the file. 
A document file as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 
the parallel guide edges (281,282) of each sliding 

connection are provided by the edges of a slit (28) formed 
in the side flap (20), wherein each pair of oppositely 

directed tongues (30,32) is formed on an end flap (16,18) 
and wherein the tongues of each pair protrude through the 

slit in opposite directions to hook over the edges 
thereof. 
A document file as claimed in Claim 2, wherein 
each slit (28) extends in a direction across the corner of 

the file and at an angle 45Â° to the edge of the side flap. 
A document file as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein a sliding connection is also formed between 

the front cover (12) and the side flap (20) and wherein 
the parallel guide edges thereof are provided on the side  

 
flap at opposite ends thereof and the oppositely directed 

tongues (38) are formed on the front cover (12) at 
opposite ends thereof;
 
the spacing between the tongues (38) corresponding to the 

spacing between the guide edges (36) and the guide edges 
having ends to limit the sliding movement of the tongues 

therealong. 
A document file as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein each hinge (22, 25, 26) comprises a 

plurality of parallel hinge lines (24) such that the 
positions of the front cover and of the flaps when 

overlying the rear cover are movable to vary the capacity 
of the file. 
A document file as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the file is made entirely by cutting and 

folding a single sheet of material. 
A document file as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the document file is made from 

polypropylene.
