<ABSTRACT>
A cone (8) on which thread (10) is wound has a central frangible section (12) at which it may easily be broken. The thread (10) forms a winding on the cone at each side of the section (12) leaving a space where it crosses the section (12). The cone (8) may be snapped in half to give two independent wound cone parts, each with approximately half the amount of thread. This allows the purchaser the flexibility to use the cone in various ways. In one embodiment, the cone parts may be urged axially together after the frangible section (12) has been broken, to become removably attached to one another with a reduced space between the respective windings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to spools, cones and like devices for 
holding windings of thread. It is particularly applicable to 
packages, upon which is wound sewing thread for industrial 
applications. In the clothing manufacture industry, for example, there is 
an increasing demand for garments to be made in small numbers 
at a time. Sewing thread for the making up of garments has 
traditionally been supplied in a number of different formats, 
principal among which is a cone carrying 5000 to 10000m of 
thread. Where smaller quantities of thread are needed, a cop 
spool may be preferred, which carries typically 1000m. The 
terms "thread" and "yarn" are used more or less 
indiscriminately herein, or as idiom demands. The large capacity of the cone can be a disadvantage as 
production runs become smaller and large amounts of thread 
are often wasted. The cop spool is a small diameter tube so 
that the innermost turns of yarn may be undesirably tightly 
coiled. Because of the small capacity of cop spools, they 
may need to be replaced frequently, which is time consuming 
because the thread from the two spools needs to be joined. Of course, an intermediate size of spool would be possible 
but it is inconvenient for all concerned to deal with too 
many different standard sizes and, besides, it will not 
always be clear in advance how much thread will be required 
in which formats. The term "cone" as used in this specification is not intended 
to limit the shape of the spool on which the thread is wound 
and includes, inter alia, spools of generally frustoconical  
 
and cylindrical shape. Belgian Patent BE-A-428899, published in 1938, relates to 
the winding of small bobbins of thread, such as may be 
used for the underthread in domestic sewing machines. It 
discloses a tube, which is divided into a plurality of 
sections by circumferential lines of weakness, a 
continuous thread being formed into windings on the 
respective sections. Individual pre-wound sections, may 
then be broken from the tube for use in a sewing machine, 
instead of winding bobbins one at a time on an attachment 
of the sewing machine, as is customary. German Patent Application DE-A-3135693 discloses a 
compound tube on which thread or other filaments may be 
wound. A plurality of sections of tube are either formed 
integrally or are joined together so that winding 
machinery can simultaneously wind a plurality of threads 
on the respective sections, increasing the machine's 
efficiency. After winding, the sections of the compound 
tube are

<CLAIMS>
A cone on which thread (10) is wound, having a 
central frangible section (12) at which it may easily be 

broken into two parts generally perpendicularly to its axis, 
the thread forming a winding on the cone at each side of the 

frangible section and leaving a space between the windings 
where the thread (10) crosses the frangible section; 

CHARACTERIZED IN THAT the cone includes means for removably 
attaching together the two cone parts after the frangible 

section (12) has been broken, so as to reduce the space 
between the respective windings. 
A cone according to claim 1, wherein after the 
frangible section (12) has been broken one of the cone parts 

can be partially inserted in a hollow of the other cone part, 
where it is removably retained by engagement between 

protrusions (17,18) on the respective parts. 
A cone according to claim 2, wherein the protrusions 
(17,18) on the cone parts are respectively a radially 

outwardly directed bead around the rim of the one cone part 
and a radially inwardly directed bead around the hollow of 

the other cone part. 
A cone according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
frangible section (12) is a thin membrane connecting the two 

cone parts. 
A cone according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
two cone parts both taper slightly in the same axial 

direction. 
A method of winding thread on a cone (8) having a 
central frangible section (12), the method comprising the 

steps of: 

(a) rotating the cone (8) while supplying thread 
(10) through a yarn guide (20) that reciprocates relative to  

 
a datum and parallel to the axis of the cone (8) to wind 

thread on the cone (8) at one side of the frangible section 
(12); 
(b) advancing the yarn guide datum through a fixed 
distance along the axis of the cone (8); 
(c) rotating the cone (8) while supplying thread 
(10) through the reciprocating yarn guide (20) to wind thread 

on the cone at the other side of the frangible section (12); 
and 
(d) breaking the frangible section (12) of the cone 
(8) and urging the two cone parts axially towards one another 

to attach the parts removably together with a reduced space 
between the two windings. 
A method according to claim 6, wherein step (a) is 
continued until a first predetermined number of turns of 

thread (10) have been wound on the cone (8) and step (c) is 
continued until a second predetermined number of turns of 

thread (10) have been wound on the cone (8). 
A method according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein 
the reciprocating action of the yarn guide (20) results from 

its engagement with a rotating cam (25) and wherein the step 
of advancing the yarn guide datum includes advancing the cam 

(25) along its axis of rotation.
