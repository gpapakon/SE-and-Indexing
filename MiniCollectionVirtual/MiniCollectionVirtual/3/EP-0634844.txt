<ABSTRACT>
An optical diplexer (25,27,29) is disclosed which significantly reduces 
the losses associated with conventional 3dB couplers. Basically, the diplexer 

comprises a standard in-line isolator (a pair of birefringent plates (27,29) separated 
by a Faraday rotator, (25)) which is modified to include a second, preferably 

polarization-specific, source such as a laser (55) at the output. The second source is 
positioned such that its output will pass through the isolator and re-enter the input 

fiber (45). For example, the second source (55) is located below the output fiber and 
angled upward to provide coupling into the device. A third source (53), e.g. of 

pumping radiation for an erbium-doped input fiber (45), may be included, positioned 
above the output fiber and tilted downward towards the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical communication systems in 
general, and more particularly to optical diplexers. An example of a particular type of single-fiber optical communication 
system is shown in FIG. 1. During the operation of the system depicted in FIG. 1, it 
is desired that transmitter 13 send signals to receiver 11 while transmitter 15 sends 
signals or communicates with receiver 17. Simultaneous two-way communication 
via channel 23 (typically an optical fiber) is achieved through the use of two 
diplexers 19 and 21. The diplexers in current common use are usually 1×2 fiber 
couplers. While permitting simultaneous two-way communication in systems 
similar to that depicted in FIG. 1, ideal, symmetric 1×2 couplers extract a 3dB 
penalty. Consequently, the signal transmitted by transmitter 13 is reduced by a 
minimum of 6dB (in addition to transmission losses and other non-ideal losses) 
when received at receiver 11. Also, transmission from 15 to 17 suffers a 6dB 
minimum coupler loss as well. Those concerned with the development of optical communication 
systems have consistently sought diplexers and other components with minimal 
signal attenuation. For example, U.S. patent 4,548,478 issued to Shirasaki discusses 
an optical isolator which exhibits reduced attenuation. An isolator may be utilized to provide a diplexing function in the 
present invention which includes: an isolator providing polarization independent 
communication from a first point to a second point on opposite sides of the isolator 
and substantially attenuating communication from the second point to the first point. A first fiber is positioned at the first point; and a second fiber is 
positioned at the second point; then a third fiber is positioned on the same side of the 
isolator as the second fiber and away from its optic axis, whereby light of a 
predetermined polarization emanating from the third fiber traverses the isolator and 
enters the first fiber. FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an optical communication system; FIGS. 2, 3, 4 and 5 are diagrams showing an illustrative embodiment of 
the present invention. FIG. 2 is a diagram depicting a prior art device 24 employed as an 
isolator. Reference numeral 25 denotes a Faraday rotator, illustratively an yttrium 
iron garnet (YIG) single crystal. Reference numerals 27 and 29 denote a matched 
pair of birefringent crystals, typically, TiO₂ (rutile) wedges. The length of the 
yttrium iron garnet crystal is chosen to provide a 45° non-reciprocal rotation of 
linear
