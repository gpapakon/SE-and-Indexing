an upright cylindrical housing (11) provided therein with a 

plurality of circumferentially spaced lateral support beams 
(12, 13) arranged to form a vertical gas induction passage 

(P₁) at the center of the housing and a pluraity of circumferentially 
spaced vertical discharge passages (P₂) along 

an internal peripheral surface of the housing, and plural 
sets of circumferentially spaced filter assemblies (21) 

vertically mounted on the support beams in such a manner 
that the filter assemblies (21) are exposed at their inner 

ends to the gas induction passage (P₁) and at their outer 
ends to the discharge passages (P₂), wherein an internal 

upright support housing (22) is disposed within the cylindrical 
housing (11) concentrically therewith to form the 

vertical gas induction passage (P₁), the filter assemblies 
(21) are coupled at their inner ends with the corresponding 

openings (22d) formed in the peripheral wall of the support 
housing (22), and the support housing (22) is vertically 

displaceably coupled at its upper end (22b) with a gas

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dust collecting
apparatus for purifying high-temperaure gases.In the case that high-temperature gases are utilized as
a source of thermal energy, it is required to eliminate
dust from the high-temperature gases for use in a clean
condition. In the case that exhaust gases are discharged
into the atmospheric air, it is also required to eliminate
dust from the exhaust gases.To satisfy the requirements described above, there have
been various dust collecting apparatuses for purifying the
high-temperature gases. In Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication No. 4-354506, there is disclosed a dust collecting
apparatus of this kind which has an upright cylindrical
housing provided therein with a pair of radially
spaced vertical partition wall members secured at their
side edges to an internal peripheral wall of the cylindrical 
housing to form a pair of vertical gas induction passages
along the internal peripheral wall and to form a
discharge passage at the center of the cylindrical housing,
plural pairs of vertically spaced horizontal support members
fixed to the vertical partition wall members, plural
sets of filter assemblies vertically mounted on each pair
of the horizontal support members in such a manner that the
filter assemblies are exposed at their inner ends to the
vertical discharge passage and at their outer ends to the
vertical induction passages, the filter assemblies each
being composed of a plurality of filter elements integrally
assembled as a unit, each of the filter elements being
made of porous ceramic material and having a thin walled
cellular structure formed with a plurality of axial passages
separated from each other by thin partition walls,
wherein a first group of the axial passages are opened at
their one ends to introduce therein high-temperature gases
to be purified from the vertical induction passage and
closed at their other ends, while a second group of the
axial passages are closed at their one ends and opened at
their other ends to discharge purified gases therefrom into
the vertical discharge passage.The purifying efficiency of the dust collecting
apparatus is extremely high. When the component parts of the
dust collecting apparatus such as the cylindrical housing
body, the vertical partition wall members, the horizontal 
support members and the filter assemblies are made of
different materials, that is to say, the vertical
partition wall members are made of metal,
while the filter assemblies are made of porous ceramic
material superior in
