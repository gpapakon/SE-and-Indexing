<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle tyre with a profiled tread pattern on the circumference (pitches) of which at least two different lengths are arranged, the tread being divided axially into a plurality of parts and the subsequent pitch lengths forming a sequence in each of the axial parts. In order to reduce further the fluctuations in radial force which cause wheel suspension components and vehicle body components to vibrate as a result of the transmission of solid-borne sound, it is proposed to dimension the phase offset between the pitch sequences of the different tread parts in such a way that the distance between the absolute extremes of the total of the weighted mappings according to a function defined below is at a minimum or is at most 25% greater than this minimum. At the same time, each part of the tread is assigned a function which is the adjacent erosion of the successive pitches of the respective part of the tread on the abscissa accompanied by erosion of the respective pitch length starting from the abscissa on the ordinate. A "mapping" of each of these functions is determined and is the remainder after the elimination of all the harmonic components higher than the x-th order, x being an integer between 8 and 14. In order to determine this remainder the function is initially analysed harmonically from the first to the x-th order and the mapping is acquired by synthesis from these data including the phase information.

Vehicle tyre (1), having a profiled tread 
surface (2), on the periphery of which are disposed 

profile steps (pitches) of at least two different 
lengths (11, 12), the tread surface (2) being divided 

axially into a plurality of portions (2a, 2b), and the 
successive step lengths in each of the axial portions 

(2a, 2b) forming a step sequence,
 
characterised in that 


the phase association between the step sequences 
of the various tread surface portions (2a, 2b) is so 

dimensioned that the spacing (A) between the absolute 
extremes of the sum (gz) of the calibrated images (ga, 

gb) of each function (fa or fb respectively) is minimal 
or, at most, 25 % greater than this minimum, 
each tread surface portion (2a, 2b) having 

associated therewith a function (fa or fb respectively), 
which is the consecutive plotting of the step lengths 

(11, 11, 12, 12, 11, 12, ...), which follow one another 
according to the sequence, of the pertinent tread 

surface portion (2a or 2b respectively) on the abscissa 
by plotting the respective step length (11 or 12 

respectively) from the abscissa on the ordinate; 
the image (ga or gb respectively) of each 
function (fa or fb respectively) being the true 

amplitude and phase synthesis of the Fourier analysis of 
the function (fa or fb respectively) from the 1st to the 

xth harmonic; 
x being a whole number between 8 and 14; 
and the calibration factors before the images to 
be added resulting in the sum 1. 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that x is a whole number between 9 and 

11.  
 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the spacing (A) between the 

absolute extreme values of the sum (gz) of the images 
(ga, gb) of the functions (fa, fb) is, at most, 10 % 

greater than the minimum. 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to claim 1, wherein 
the successive step lengths in each of the axial 

portions (2a, 2b) form a step sequence, characterised in 
that all of the step sequences of the axial portions 

(2a, 2b), apart from their phase position, are 
identical. 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that at least its two 

axially outermost positive tracks (3, 7) exhibit the 
same step sequence and are disposed in a practically 

phase-identical manner relative to one another - i.e. 
with a maximum offset phase arrangement of 2°. 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to claim 5, 
characterised in that each eccentrically situated 

positive track (4) of one tyre side (L) is paired with a 
positive track (6), which lies at the same spacing on 

the other side (R) of the tyre centre (M), in such a 
manner that they (4, 6) exhibit the same step sequence 

and lie in a practically phase-identical manner relative 
to one another. 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the calibration 

factors of the individual images are proportional to the 
product of the respective supporting proportion of 

contact area times the axial extension of these  
 

transverse grooves (8), or respectively times the cosine 
of the angle of the inclined position of the transverse 

grooves (8) relative to the circumferential direction 
(U) of the tyre in the associated positive tracks. 
Vehicle tyre (1) according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the offset phase 

arrangement (β) is greater than 30°. 
Method of measuring the optimum offset phase 
arrangement between at least two tread surface portions 

(2a, 2b) of a vehicle tyre (1), which portions are 
disposed axially adjacent each other, wherein the tyre 

profile is non-uniformly divided in each tread surface 
portion according to a step sequence (pitch sequence),
 
characterised 


in that a function (fa or fb respectively) is 
initially determined for each tread surface portion (2a, 

2b) by consecutively plotting the successive pitches 
(p1, p2, ... pn, n = pitch number in the pertinent tread 

surface portion) of variable lengths (11, 12) of the 
pertinent tread surface portion (2a) on the abscissa by 

plotting the respective pitch length from the abscissa 
on the ordinate, 
then all of the functions (fa, fb) are 
harmonically analysed from the order of 1 to the order 

of x, x being a whole number between 8 and 14, 
and then, for each function (fa or fb 
respectively), an image is determined in such a manner 

that it is the synthesis which belongs exactly to the 
entirety of the previously obtained analysis data (that 

is to say not only to the amplitude information but also 
to the phase information!),  

 
in that the phase association between the pitch 
sequences of the various tread surface portions (2a, 2b) 

is determined - e.g. by iteration calculation - wherein 
the spacing between the absolute extreme values of the 

sum of the calibrated images (ga and gb respectively) of 
the functions (fa, fb) is minimal or, at most, 25 % 

greater than this minimum,

determined according to the above method is realised in
