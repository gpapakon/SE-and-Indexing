<DESCRIPTION>
 TWO AXIS MOUNT POINTING APPARATUSField of the Invention This invention relates to a pointing apparatus for pointing a device at a target. More particularly, this invention is directed toward a pointing apparatus utilizing a two axis mount. The pointing apparatus of the present invention is particularly well-suited for use in a target tracking system located on a moving body such as a ship, and can be used to implement a satellite tracking system wherein an antenna is continuously pointed in the direction of a satellite.Background of the Invention Satellite communication systems have been developed for transmitting information from a source to a destination. In these communication systems, an information signal is initially transmitted from the source to a geostationary satellite. The signal is received by the satellite, and then retransmitted to the destination. An antenna is utilized at the source to transmit the signal to the satellite, and at the destination to receive the retransmitted signal from the satellite. To ensure that the communication link is maintained, both the transmitting and receiving antennas must be pointed in the direction of the satellite. Geostationary satellites orbit the earth in such a manner that they maintain a constant orientation relative to any particular location on the earth's surface. Therefore, if the source and destination have fixed locations, the antenna pointing direction for each, once established, is essentially fixed. Consequently, for communication systems that have fixed transmitting and receiving locations, the satellite tracking system need not adjust the antenna pointing direction on a continuous basis in order tc track the satellite. 

 Systems have also been developed for establishing a satellite communication link with a mobile body, such as a motor vehicle or a ship. When a satellite tracking system is installed on a ship, an antenna is mounted on the ship for transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a geostationary satellite. The antenna pointing apparatus for a Îµhipborne tracking system is more complex than for stationary tracking systems because the pointing direction of the antenna, relative to the ship, continuously changes due to various factors associated with the orientation of the ship-. As the ship travels from one location to another, it may change its heading direction relative to the earth which causes a corresponding change (yaw) in the desired pointing direction of the antenna relative to the ship. Additionally, as a result of
