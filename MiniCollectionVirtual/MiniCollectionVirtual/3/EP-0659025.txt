<ABSTRACT>
The transmitter has a signal source (1) providing television signals with an image ratio of 16:9 and a second source (2) providing television signals with a ratio of 4:3, each coupled to a mixer (6) receiving further inputs from an image format converter (3, 4, 5) of a letterbox coder. A colour modulator (8) is inserted between the output of the mixer and an identification signal insertion stage (9). Pref. the image format converter allows the edge line signals to be replaced by black level signals.
