<ABSTRACT>
A waterproof box-like casing comprising, a box-like 
body having an opening, a lid for closing the opening and 

having a communication hole, and a bulkhead member for covering 
the communication hole hermetically. The communication hole 

provides communication between the inside and outside of the 
box-like body. Furthermore, the bulkhead member expands volume 

when the air inside of the waterproof box-like casing expands 
because of thermal expansion and contracts volume when the air 

inside of the waterproof box-like casing contracts because of 
thermal contraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a waterproof box-like casing, 
and more particularly to a waterproof box-like casing suited 
for housing an electronic unit or the like within an engine 
room of a vehicle. An object to be waterproofed is received within a box-like 
body of a waterproof box-like casing having an opening, 
and then this opening is hermetically closed by a lid, and then 
the casing is mounted at a predetermined position. With a 
simple box-like sealed construction, however, the hermetic 
condition can not always be maintained in an environment in 
which the temperature abruptly changes. For example, a 
waterproof box-like casing holds an engine-control electronic 
equipment therein, and is mounted within an engine room. The 
interior of the engine room is liable to increase in 
temperature. When water is splashed on the waterproof casing 
during the running, the temperature drops abruptly. As a 
result, the atmospheric pressure within the casing decreases in 
accordance with the temperature change, and therefore a strain 
develops in the casing, so that the water intrudes through a 
gap around the lid of the hermetic construction.  
 Therefore, conventionally, as disclosed in Japanese 
Utility Model Unexamined Publication Nos. 56-112978 and 57-186094, 
a waterproof box-like casing has not been of a sealed 
construction, and instead a vent hole has been formed in the 
casing so as to make the inside and outside of the casing equal 
in atmospheric pressure to each other. In the construction 
shown in the former publication, the vent hole is in the form 
of a labyrinth, and moisture is held in the labyrinth when the 
outside air flows into the casing. In the construction shown 
in the latter publication, the vent hole is covered by an 
auxiliary plate to provide a staggered vent passage so that the 
water will not immediately intrude. The above-mentioned conventional waterproof box-like 
casings have the following problems. Namely, in the former, when an amount of the water 
which is greater than the water being able to be held in the 
labyrinth-like vent hole is drawn together with the outside 
air, this water intrudes into the interior. In the latter, the 
vigorously splashed water will inevitably intrude into the 
casing. The present invention has been made in view of the 
above problems, and an object of the invention is to provide a 
waterproof box-like casing which can provide a good waterproof 
effect even in an environment in which a temperature change is 
vigorous. WO-A-84 01082 describes a

<CLAIMS>
A waterproof box-like casing for housing an electronic unit comprising: 

a box-like body (10) having an opening; 
a lid (20) for closing said opening and having a communication 
hole (21); 
a bulkhead member (23) for covering said communication 
hole (21) hermetically, said communication hole (21) providing 

communication between the inside of said box-like 
body (10) and the inside of said bulkhead member (23), 

wherein said bulkhead member (23) expands in volume when 
the air inside said waterproof box-like casing expands because 

of thermal expansion and contracts in volume when the 
air inside said waterproof box-like casing contracts because 

of thermal contraction, 
 
   characterized in that
 
   said bulkhead member (23) further comprises a peripheral 

skirt portion (23b), the distal end of which abuts 
against a peripheral edge portion of said communication 

hole (21). 
A waterproof box-like casing as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said bulkhead member (23) is made of rubber. 
A waterproof box-like casing as claimed in claim 1 
or 2, wherein a peripheral wall of said bulkhead member 

(23) is in the form of bellows.
