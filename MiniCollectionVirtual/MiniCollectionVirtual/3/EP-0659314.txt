<ABSTRACT>
A method of coding, and a coder, using a code in which data words are assigned to code word pairs in a selective manner, so that the value of a data word error resulting from inversion of a bit in a code word may be specific to and dependent solely upon the position within the code word of the inverted bit.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Encoding dataTechnical FieldThis invention relates to methods and coders for encoding data.Background ArtThe spread of personal computers and workstations has led to the development of networks for interconnecting such equipment and common resources such as printers and data storage devices. More powerful and sophisticated computing equipment and programs have progressively become available, allowing the processing of data in larger and larger quantities, for example in the form of database information and graphic images. These developments have in turn placed increasing demands on the speed and capacity of networks.Various new networking technologies have been proposed to cater for these demands. One such technology is the fibre distributed data interface (FDDI), which is based on the use of optical fibres and optical signals. However, practical experience has shown that although this technology can provide the required performance, it is relatively expensive, requiring the costly process of installing complete new networks of optical fibre, which is itself inherently expensive. Accordingly attention has also been directed to the possibility of transferring data at high speed over existing wiring installations, thereby avoiding the cost of installing a new network and gaining additional return for the expense previously incurred in installing the existing wiring.One possible technique along these lines involves the use of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) telephone cables of the kind already used for lower-speed local-area networks. In this technique, described for example in US Patent 5 119 402, the required high data rate is achieved by transferring the data over multiple conductors, so that different portions of the data are transmitted simultaneously over respective conductors.Although this technique provides many advantages, it also suffers from potential specific problems. In particular, a primary source of noise affecting such transmissions is electrical impulses, which can affect all conductors together for an extended period relative to the duration of transmission of a data bit. Thus, for example, twenty successive bits of the data to be transmitted may be split into four blocks of five bits each, and encoded by selecting six-bit code values in accordance with the five-bit values from a predefined 5B/6B code table. The four encoded blocks are then transmitted as a group simultaneously along respective ones of four conductors in a multi-conductor cable. It is possible for two successive groups of

CLAIMS
1. A method of encoding n-bit data words as (n-t-7)-bit code words, wherein code words are selected in accordance with the values of the data words and a code having the property that the value of a data word error resulting from inversion of a bit in a code word is specific to and dependent solely upon the position within the code word of the inverted bit.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein said code is selected from the group comprising:
(a) any code in which each data word is definable in terms of one or more of n independent n-bit parameters, and each code word satisfies the condition that each of n of its bits has a value dependent upon whether a respective one of said parameters is included in the definition of the data word associated with that code word; and (b) any invariance transformation thereof.
3. The method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said code words contain at least four binary digits.

A coder for encoding n-bit data words as (n+7)-bit code words, comprising means for receiving data words and for selecting code words in accordance with the values of the data words and a code having the property that the value of a data word error resulting from inversion of a bit in a code word is specific to and dependent solely upon the position within the code word of the inverted bit.
5. The coder according to claim 4, wherein said code is selected from the group comprising:
(a) any code in which each data word is definable in terms of one or more of n independent n-bit parameters, and each code word satisfies the condition that each of n of its bits has a value dependent upon whether a respective one of said parameters is included in the definition of the data word associated with that code word; and
(b) any invariance transformation thereof.
6. The coder according to claim 4 or claim 5, wherein said code words contain at least four binary digits.
7. A method of decoding n-bit data words from (n +7)-bit code words, wherein data words are selected in accordance with the values of the code words and a code having the 


property that the value of a data word error resulting from inversion of a bit in a code word is specific to and dependent solely upon the position within the code word of the inverted bit.
8. A decoder for decoding n-bit data words from (n+7)-bit code words, comprising means for receiving code words and for selecting data words in accordance with the values of the code words and a code having the property that the value of a data word error resulting from inversion of a bit in a code word is specific to and dependent solely upon the position within the code word of the inverted bit.
