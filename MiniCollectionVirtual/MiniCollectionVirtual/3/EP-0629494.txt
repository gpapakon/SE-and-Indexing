<ABSTRACT>
A continuous press is intended to be configured such that, with it, webs of material can be produced, whose webs require a high pressure and a pronounced reduction in thickness during the pressing operation. The press is made up of a temperature-controllable and drivable central drum (1) and of a circulating endless steel band (2) which is braced over at least two deflection drums (3, 4) and a bracing drum (5) and the central drum, the material web (8) to be pressed being guided, temperature-controlled and pressed between the central-drum outer surface and the steel band. An additional press-on device (9) is formed from elastic steel-band sections, the steel-band sections exhibiting an opening at a defined location of its surface, and a connection tube which is intended for a compressed-air or water-vapour source which forms a compressed-air or supporting steam lubrication film being flanged onto the opening.

Continuously operating material press for 
producing endless composite sheets, chipboards, 

fibreboards, rubber sheets and plastics material sheets 
as well as substances or papers impregnated with 

synthetic resin, including a temperature-controllable 
and drivable central drum (1), a circulatory, endless 

steel belt (2) which is tensioned over at least two 
guide drums (3, 4) and a tensioning drum (5) as well as 

over the central drum (1), wherein the material web to 
be processed is guided between the central drum surface 

and the steel belt (2), temperature-controlled and 
pressed, and an additional pressing device (9) which is 

disposed over the rear side of the steel belt (2) remote 
from the material web along a portion of the surface of 

the central drum (1), said additional pressing device 
being connected at one end to the material press support 

(12), when viewed with respect to the operating 
direction, and having at the other end a tensioning 

device (13) which is also connected to the press 
support (12), characterised i
n that the additional 
pressing device (9) is formed from resilient steel strip 

portions (10), in that the steel strip portions (10) 
have an opening (17) at a specific location along their 

surface, in that a connection tube (16) is mounted on 
the opening (17) for a source of compressed air or water 

vapour which forms a lubricating film (18) of compressed 
air or supporting vapour. 
Continuous material press according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the side of the steel strip 

portions (10) facing the endless steel belt (2) has air 
guiding grooves (19, 20), in that the air guiding  

 
grooves (19, 20) are connected to the opening (17) in 

the steel strip portion (10), in that a source of 
compressed air or water vapour, which forms a 

lubricating film (18) of compressed air or water vapour, 
communicates with the opening (17) in the steel strip 

portions (10). 
Continuous material press according to one of 
claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the steel strip 

portions (10), which form the pressing area of the 
additional pressing device (9), have longitudinal and 

transverse grooves (19, 20) which are connected to the 
opening communicating with the compressed air or water 

vapour respectively. 
Continuous material press according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the steel strip 

portions (10), forming the pressing area, have 
transverse grooves (19) starting from the compressed 

air- or water vapour-supplying opening (17), and said 
portions are connected to respective longitudinal 

grooves (20). 
Continuous material press according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the steel strip portions (10), 

forming the pressing area, are secured at their one end 
to the support structure of the press, and in that 

hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, which co-operate with 
the support (12) and tension the steel strip portions 

(10) over the curved area, are disposed at the other 
end. 
Continuous material press according to one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the steel strip  

 
portions (10) have a slide layer (15), which has 

emergency running properties.
