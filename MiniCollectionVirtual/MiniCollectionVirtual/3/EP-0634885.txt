<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing an X-ray apparatus 
having a stable X-ray output. Since the focus electrode 

of the X-ray tube of the X-ray apparatus according to this 
invention maintains a ground potential, the focus 

diameter of electrons bombarded against a target becomes 
constant. Hence, the X-ray output emerging from an exit 

window is stabilized. Since the potential ratio of a 
cathode to the target is always constant, the electric 

field distribution between the cathode and the target is 
stabilized, thereby stabilizing the X-ray output emerging 

from the exit window.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an X-ray apparatus
incorporating an X-ray tube.Conventionally, as the technique of this field,
ones disclosed in U.S.P. Nos. 5,077,771, 4,646,338, and
4,694,480 are known. Each prior art disclose a portable
X-ray apparatus comprising an X-ray tube, a molded high-voltage
power supply, and a molded control circuit.To apply a voltage to the X-ray tube of this X-ray
apparatus, a cathode voltage, a target
voltage, or a focus voltage is variably applied to the
X-ray tube. However, none of these schemes is suitable
for a method of generating and controlling a microfocus
X-ray which is the most important subject-matter of a
microfocus X-ray apparatus.It is an aim of the invention to solve this
problem.In DE-2053606 there is described an X-ray tube and
a device for adjusting the size of the focal spot in the
tube the tube including an electrode connected to a
movable tap on a transformer winding, which is coupled to
the tube anode and cathode, the device including means
for automatically varying the position of the tap when
the tube loading is varied to vary the spot size.According to the present invention, there is
provided an X-ray apparatus comprising:
an X-ray tube comprising a cathode for emitting
electrons when heated by a heater, a target for
generating X-rays when bombarded by said electrons, and
a fixed-potential focus electrode for focusing said electrons onto said 
target; an target controller, a cathode controller and a control circuit which is
operable to control variable voltages applied to said
target and to said cathode in an interlocked manner characterized in that
a voltage for setting the target voltage is simultaneously applied to
the target controller and the cathode controller such
that the voltage applied to the target varies in
substantially direct proportion to the voltage applied
to the cathode, whereby the ratio between the cathode
voltage and the target voltage remains constant.In an embodiment, with this arrangement, the focus
electrode is maintained at ground potential and will not
vary. Hence, the focus diameter of the electrons
bombarded against the target becomes constant, and the
X-ray output radiated from the target is stabilized.
The voltage applied to the cathode and the voltage
applied to the target are changed by the control
operation of the control circuit at a predetermined
ratio in an interlocked manner. Thus, the electric
field distribution between the cathode and the target
will not be disturbed.The X-ray tube may also have a conductive
