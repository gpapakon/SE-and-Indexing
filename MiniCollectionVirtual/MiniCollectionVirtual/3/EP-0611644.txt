<ABSTRACT>
A thermo-formed object used in refrigerators/freezers is 
at present formed as an independent unit. The object 

varies in thickness of material and thus has places 
which are vulnerable to damage during form ejection and 

subsequent transportation and use (fig. 1). The object 
is part of a sandwich construction and is thus supported 

at a later stage (fig. 2). 
The invention is a method to support the thermo-formed 
object in especially exposed places (fig. 3) and to make 

possible a reduction in thickness of material compared 
to the known method. By using a material in the 

reinforcement which may become part of the finished 
sandwich construction (fig. 7) dismantling cost is 

avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for making a sandwich construction comprising a
thermoformed object such as an inner liner or another plastic part of a refrigerator or
freezer, an insulating material and a cabinet wall, which before ejection needs to be
supported at desired locations.Normally the stiffness of the thermoformed object during form ejection and the
resistance to damages of such thermoformed objects during subsequent transportation
and application are only determined by the configuration and thickness of the object
itself.US-A-4102964 discloses the vacuum forming of a thermoformed object followed by
the coating by spraying of the object still on the mold by a rigidizeable layer of
resinous material and then upon completion of the coating and curing of the coating
material by removal of the rigidized object. DE-A-1479080 discloses a similar method
with the additional step of using a second thermo-formed object to sandwich the coating
between the two thermoformed objects.The invention has for its purpose to provide a new and improved method for supporting
thermoformed objects before form ejection and by which method it by simple provisions
becomes possible to obtain at least a temporary reinforcement of weak sections
of such thin-walled thermoformed objects before and after the form ejection, as the
thermoformed objects are adapted to form parts of a sandwich construction.The method according to the invention includes the step of either adding the
insulating material to, or spraying cellular plastic or some other polymer on to, or
placing foam compartments on, or placing tapes on the outer surface of the thermoformed
object at said desired locations in order to increase the stiffness of the thermoformed
object prior to form ejection. By simple provisions
it hereby becomes possible to obtain at least a temporary reinforcement of weak
sections of such thin-walled thermoformed objects before and after the form ejection -
as by way of example said sandwich construction comprising said thermoformed object
as an inner wall part, said insulating material and said outer cabinet wall. In other words the invention provides for the possibility of supporting especially weak
parts of the thermo-shaped object - such as projecting points; and the method according
to the invention makes it possible in general to reduce the thickness of the plastic
material of the thermoformed object. The constructor of the plastic parts will have
more freedom in the shaping as the material may be supported prior to be
