<ABSTRACT>
The efficiency of multiple downcomer type fractionation 
trays is increased by providing a pair of inclined liquid 

deflecting baffles [3] over each downcomer [10]
 connecting the 
outlets and inlets of vertically adjacent downcomers to thereby 

provide a circular liquid flow path relative to liquid movement 
on each tray and parallel liquid flow on a tray-to-tray basis 

which acts to increase the length of the liquid flow path and 
produce Lewis Case II point to plate efficiency enhancement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the design and construction of 
vapor-liquid contacting apparatus used as fractionation trays 
within fractional distillation columns to perform separations of 
volatile chemical compounds. Fractional distillation trays are widely employed in 
the hydrocarbon processing, chemical, and petrochemical 
industries. Accordingly, a large amount of research, 
development, and creative thinking has been devoted to providing 
improved fractional distillation trays. Fractionation tray 
development has therefore provided many variations in contacting 
area structure, downcomer design, and overall tray structure. US-A-3 410 540 shows the structure of a prior art 
multiple downcomer type tray employing the highly distinctive 
downcomer design similar to that employed in the subject tray. US-A-4,582,569 discloses a fractionation column wherein 
the upward vapor flow is divided into two separate parallel 
streams by a central baffle extending through the center of the 
column. An article appearing at page 30 of the October 19,1983 
edition of Chemical Week magazine illustrates another 
fractionation tray flow wherein a central baffle divides the 
column into two separate vapor passage zones, with the liquid 
flowing downward from side to side between the two zones.  
 GB-A-2002650 describes a vapor-liquid contacting tray for use in a column containing 
a plurality of such trays. Each tray has downcomers having spout openings in their 
bottoms for liquid flow to the next lower tray. Lip means extend transversely below 
the openings and partway to the next lower tray, so as to provide vertical damping 
of downward liquid flow and to provide a horizontal velocity component to the liquid 
flow, so that it falls on to liquid between two downcomers of the next lower tray, the 
liquid between the downcomers overflowing into the downcomers in both directions. The present invention provides a a vapor-liquid contacting tray having a generally 
circular circumference and comprising: 
(i) at least one narrow, trough-shaped downcomer, each downcomer 
being formed by two opposing side walls and two end walls which are shorter 
than the side walls, the walls being oriented perpendicular to the plane of the 
tray, each downcomer having an open inlet and a bottom plate having a 
plurality of openings providing a liquid-sealable outlet means; (ii) at least two elongated vapor-liquid contacting decks, with a vapor-liquid 
contacting deck being located adjacent each downcomer side wall such 
that the tray has at

A vapor-liquid contacting tray (12) having a generally circular circumference 
and comprising: 


(i) at least one narrow, trough-shaped downcomer (10), each downcomer 
(10) being formed by two opposing side walls (4) and two end walls (6) which 

are shorter than the side walls (4), the walls (4,6) being oriented perpendicular 
to the plane of the tray (2), each downcomer (10) having an open inlet and a 

bottom plate having a plurality of openings (9) providing a liquid- sealable 
outlet means; 
(ii) at least two elongated vapor-liquid contacting decks (11), with a vapor-liquid 
contacting deck (11) being located adjacent each downcomer side wall 

(4) such that the tray (2) has at least one more vapor-liquid contacting deck 
(11) than downcomer means (10), and 
(iii) means to define downward liquid flow paths for liquid flowing onto the 
tray (2) from a vertically superior downcomer, comprising inclined baffles (3) 

preventing downwards-flowing liquid from a downcomer (10) from falling 
directly into a downcomer of a subjacent tray, characterized in that each 

downcomer has two inclined downcomer baffles (3), with the downcomer 
baffles (3) intersecting an upper edge (5) of the side walls (4), the downcomer 

baffles (3) being substantially equal in length to one-half of the associated 
downcomer (10) and crossing over the open inlets of each downcomer (10), 

with the two downcomer baffles (3) of each downcomer (10) being inclined 
to deliver liquid to different contacting decks. 
A vapor-liquid contacting tray according to Claim 1, characterized by a central 
baffle (7) rising upwards from the deck, extending perpendicularly of each downcomer 

(10), and separating the two downcomer baffles (3) of each downcomer, all the  
 

downcomer baffles (3) on one side of the central baffles (7) being inclined in one 
direction, and all those on the second side of the central baffle being inclined in the 

opposite direction. 
A vapor-liquid contacting tray according to Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that 
horizontal plates (15) are provided where the lower end of each downcomer baffle (3) 

intersects the upper edge of the side wall of a respective downcomer, said plates 
extending over the deck (11) of the respective tray. 
A vapor-liquid contacting tray according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
downcomer baffles (3') of one downcomer are inclined in an opposite direction to the 

downcomer baffles (3) on an adjacent downcomer. 
A vapor-liquid contacting tray according to Claim 4 characterized by a liquid 
flow-directing baffle (16), rising upwards from the deck and being parallel to the 

downcomers and located between two downcomer baffles (3 and 3') on adjacent 
downcomers delivering liquid towards one another. 
A vapor-liquid contacting tray according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 

characterized in that the downcomer baffles (3,3') are imperforate. 
A fractionation column characterized by comprising a plurality of trays 
according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, located one above another with the 

downcomers being aligned with and located directly above one another.
