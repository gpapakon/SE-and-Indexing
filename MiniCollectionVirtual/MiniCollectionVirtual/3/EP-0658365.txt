<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum and other pressure swing adsorption 
vessels are monitored, and corrective adjustments are 

made in the pressure equalization and/or 
repressurization steps in response to imbalances in 

the temperature profiles of the vessels in order to 
tune the system. The PSA process is also desirably 

purge tuned to avoid over purging or under purging of 
each vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - The invention relates to
pressure swing adsorption for gas separation. More
particularly, it relates to the tuning of vacuum
pressure swing adsorption systems to maintain stable
high performance.Description of the Prior Art - Pressure swing
adsorption (PSA) processes have been used to separate
and purify gases in highly significant applications,
such as the separation of air to produce oxygen or
nitrogen product gas. Most PSA processes are carried
out in multi-bed systems with each bed undergoing the
same sequence of steps but in a different phase
relationship with other beds in the system. Such
processes involve adsorption at an upper pressure
level, desorption at a lower pressure level, and
repressurization from the lower pressure to the upper
pressure. Many PSA processes also employ one or more
pressure equalization steps or repressurization steps
in which gas is withdrawn from one bed at high pressure
and passed, directly or through the use of a surge
tank, to another bed initially at lower pressure until
the pressures in said beds are equalized. This enables
some compression energy to be saved, and generally also
enhances the overall recovery of product gas, e.g.,
oxygen, in the process. Particularly, a PSA processing sequence of the type
defined in the preamble portion of claim 1 is known.In vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA)
processes, the lower desorption pressure is a sub-atmospheric,
i.e., vacuum, desorption pressure. In a
desirable VPSA processing sequence for air separation,
the following sequence of operating steps is carried 
out, on a cyclic basis, in one or more adsorbent beds
capable of selectively adsorbing a more adsorbable
component of a feed gas mixture from the less
adsorbable component thereof; (1) feed gas
pressurization of each adsorbent bed from an
intermediate pressure to the upper, super-atmospheric
adsorption pressure; (2) feed gas introduction to the
feed end of thereof at said upper adsorption pressure,
with adsorption of the more adsorbable component and
simultaneous withdrawal of the less adsorbable
component from the product end of the bed; (3)
countercurrent depressurization to a lower pressure,
with release of gas from the feed end of the bed; (4)
evacuation to a lower sub-atmospheric, i.e., vacuum,
desorption pressure; (5) optional purge, typically by
the introduction of a small amount of product gas to
the product end of the bed at the lower desorption
pressure; and (6) repressurization of the bed to the
intermediate pressure level.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the tuning of a pressure swing adsorption system for the separation and
recovery of a component of a feed gas stream, said system containing at least two

adsorbent beds capable of selectively adsorbing one component of the feed gas stream
from another, wherein each bed undergoes, on a cyclic basis, a processing sequence

including: (1) repressurization from an intermediate pressure to an upper adsorption
pressure; (2) feed gas introduction to the feed end of the bed at the upper adsorption

pressure with withdrawal of a less selectively adsorbable component from the product
end of the bed; (3)

pressure
equalization,

preferably as a cocurrent depressurization,
with release of gas from the product end of the bed and its passage to the

product end of another bed in the system initially at a lower pressure for pressure
equalization at a intermediate pressure; (4) countercurrent depressurization to a lower

desorption pressure, with release of gas from the feed end of the bed; and (5)
partial repressurization to said intermediate pressure, with passage of gas to the product

end of the bed, said gas having been released from another bed in the system initially at
a higher pressure for pressure equalization at said intermediate pressure,

characterized by

(a) monitoring bed temperature at the same portion of each adsorbent bed so as to track
a temperature profile in each bed; and
(b) adjusting the amount of gas coming from each adsorbent bed in response to an
imbalance in the system as determined by variations in the temperature profiles in

the beds, with (1) the amount of net gas released from the product end of a bed 
having a temperature range therein exceeding a normal temperature profile of said

bed unter normal balanced operating conditions of the system, and being produced
as reflux gas for another bed, being increased so as to lower said temperature

profile therein to a normal balanced condition, and (2) the amount of net gas
released from the product end of a bed having a temperature rage therein that is

less than the normal temperature profile of said bed under normal balanced
operating conditions of the system, and being produced as reflux gas for another

bed, being decreased so as to increase the temperature profile therein to its normal
balanced condition, whereby the system, rendered imbalanced due to a processing

disturbance, is advantageously restored to a balanced operating condition for the
maintenance of stable high performance of the system.

desorption pressure following initial countercurrent

the process of claim 17 in which said system

from air.
The process of claim 1 in which steps (1)
and (2) comprise introducing feed gas to the feed end

of the bed at a rate such that the pressure thereof is

adsorption pressure while less selectively adsorbable
component is withdrawn from the product end of the

bed.
