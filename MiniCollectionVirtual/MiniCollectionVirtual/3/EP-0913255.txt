<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating a thermal ink jet printer (10) with a removable print head (12)
having a plurality of ink firing resistors (44), the operation including calibrating the printer by

determining a nominal input voltage (Vs1) above a threshold necessary for simultaneous
operation of a plurality of the resistors. Then, during printing, detecting the input voltage on

the print head at an input node (40) connected to the resistors and generating a firing pulse
having a duration based on the detected input voltage at the node. Thus, a detected input

voltage higher than the nominal voltage is compensated for by a shortened firing pulse. The
method may be achieved in a removable ink jet print head having a connector with many

electrical inputs connectable to a printer, and a voltage input node (40) connected to the
connector. The print head has numerous firing resistors (42) connected to the input node.

An energy control circuit (46, 60) is connected to the input node and is connected to the
resistors to fire the resistors with a firing pulse having a duration inversely related to the

voltage at the input node, such that the firing energy is maintained in control by varying the
firing pulse duration to compensate for voltage variations

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal ink jet printers, and more particularly to the control of
droplet firing energy to provide a uniform output.Inkjet printing mechanisms use pens that shoot droplets of colorant onto a printable
surface to generate an image. Such mechanisms may be used in a wide variety of
applications, including computer printers, plotters, copiers, and facsimile machines. For
convenience, the concepts of the invention are discussed in the context of a printer. An ink
jet printer typically includes a print head having a multitude of independently addressable
firing units. Each firing unit includes an ink chamber connected to a common ink source,
and to an ink outlet nozzle. A transducer within the chamber provides the impetus for
expelling ink droplets through the nozzles. In thermal ink jet printers, the transducers are
thin film firing resistors that generate sufficient heat during application of a brief voltage
pulse to vaporize a quantity of ink sufficient to expel a liquid droplet.The energy applied to a firing resistor affects performance, durability, and efficiency. It is
well known that the firing energy must be above a certain threshold to cause a vapor bubble
to nucleate. Above this threshold in a transitional range, increasing the energy increases the
drop volume expelled. Above a higher threshold at the upper limit of the transitional range,
drop volumes do not increase with increasing energy. It is in this range in which drop 
volumes are stable even with moderate energy variations that printing ideally takes place, as
variations in drop volume cause disuniformities in printed output. As energy levels increase
above this optimal zone, uniformity is not compromised, but energy is wasted, and the
printer components are prematurely aged due to excessive heating and ink residue build up.In existing systems having a dedicated connection for each firing resistor, a one time
calibration of each connection by printer or production circuitry external to the pen also
compensates for any parasitic resistance or impedance in the unique path leading to each
resistor. Print heads may be characterized at production to set these operating parameters.However, in highly multiplexed print heads having different sets of nozzles, each set
addressed by a common voltage line, there may be variations due to other factors. Each set
of nozzles is powered by a single voltage line that receives power via an electrical contact
pad between the printer electronics and the removable print cartridge. This

The method of claim 1 wherein generating the firing pulse includes initiating the pulse,

circuit is disconnected from the input node until the switch is closed by the leading edge
of a firing pulse on the firing input.
