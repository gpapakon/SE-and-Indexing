<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical cell of cylindrical type, with a metal can (12), an anode (18), a separator (20) and a cathode (14) arranged concentrically in one another, an aqueous alkaline electrolyte solution, and a closure assembly. The closure assembly comprises a plastic top (28) inserted in the open end of the can (12) and has an outer cylindrical zone, a lower rim (40), a central portion (34) defining a central bore, and an intermediate portion (38) interconnecting the central portion with the lower rim. A current collector nail (26) is inserted through the central bore and penetrates deeply into the anode. A negative cap (24) of a metal sheet material forms the negative terminal of the cell. The negative cap has a flange portion (47) ending in an inwardly bent rim (48), the can has a bead (30) at a predetermined distance from its open end, and the bead serves as an abutment member for the closure assembly when inserted in the can. The plastic top defines a conforming support surface for the inwardly bent rim substantially at the connection zone of the outer cylindrical zone and the lower rim. The can has a gasket zone (31) above the bead, and a sealant is provided to cover the inside surface of the can at the gasket zone. The end portion of the gasket zone is crimped over the inwardly bent rim so that the outer cylindrical zone of the plastic top is pressed and crimped therebetween, whereby the inwardly bent rim provides a spring action pressing the outer cylindrical zone in radial direction towards the gasket zone and in axial direction towards the bead.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cylindrical cell with improved closure 
assembly. The leakage proof closure of cylindrical cells with an aqueous 
alkaline electrolyte solution has long been the objective of research 
and development activity, as can be demonstrated by a large number 
of patents. The different cell closure types of commercially available 
cylindrical cells released by major manufacturing companies embody 
the most up to date technical solutions. The available cell closure assemblies have the following main 
common properties: 
All of them use a cap formed from a metal sheet that is 
the negative terminal of cells. The cap has a disc-like central 
portion, and a flange portion extending towards the interior of 
the cylindrical can; A plastic top is used for electrically insulting the cathode 
from the anode and for providing a sealing gasket. In most 
designs, a blow out vent is provided in the plastic top that 
ruptures if the inner gas pressure exceeds a predetermined 
limit; A sealant, such as asphalt, polyamide or ethyl vinyl 
alcohol is provided at the inner surface of a gasket zone of the 
can, and provides a tight sealing between the can and the 
plastic top if a sufficiently large pressure is maintained 
between the contacting surfaces to be sealed;  The upper end of the can is crimped over the flange, so 
that a thin portion of the plastic top provides electrical 
insulation between the can and the flange. The crimped metal 
has the task of maintaining the pressure required between the 
can and the critical portion of the plastic top for a leakage 
proof sealing.   In LR6 (North American AA) type cells manufactured by Union 
Carbide Corporation, the flange of the negative cap has a sharp 
circular edge, and the crimping pressure of the can acts on the outer 
side of an outer cylindrical portion of the plastic top which is 
supported from the inside by this edge and by the edge of a washer. 
The crimping step should be performed carefully, since in case of 
higher forces the circular edge of the flange can cut through the 
thin plastic wall and a short circuit will be experienced. The pressure distribution along this thin plastic wall is uneven, 
and the maximum pressure is limited by the load bearing ability of 
the plastic material. After longer use or at elevated temperatures the 
resiliency of thermoplastic materials decreases, whereby the quality of 
the sealing can worsen. In the closure assembly of LR6 cells manufactured by DURACELL 
Inc., the negative cap is separated from a
