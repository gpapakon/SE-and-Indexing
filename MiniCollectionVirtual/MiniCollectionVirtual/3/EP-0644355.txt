<ABSTRACT>
A countershaft type multi-speed power 
transmission has a plurality of gear meshes disposed 

on three axes including a forward final drive gear 
(42) and a reverse final drive gear (68). Both the 

low forward ratio and the reverse ratio drive paths 
include a common one-way device (36). The gear meshes 

and a plurality of selectively operable friction 
clutches are positioned on shafting disposed on the 

three axes to provide a compact overall axial length 
for the transmission assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power 
transmissions, and more particularly, to multi-speed 
countershaft power transmissions. Specifically, this 
invention relates to countershaft power transmissions 
having a plurality of fluid operated friction clutches 
disposed on shaft members of the transmission for 
selectively connecting the gear members thereto. Countershaft type power transmissions are 
finding increasing usage in passenger vehicles. A 
majority of the transmissions have a synchroniser type 
clutch to establish the forward and reverse drive 
paths. Other of these types of transmissions utilise 
fluid operated friction clutches to establish the 
forward and reverse drive paths. The synchroniser 
type forward and reverse mechanisms also utilise a 
fluid operated clutch. However, the particular gear 
path to be utilised is determined by the synchroniser. The lowest or first forward gear ratio drive 
path generally includes a one-way device which permits 
untimed upshifting from the first or lowest ratio to 
the second ratio. The prior art transmissions use 
distinct gear paths from the input shaft to a common 
output shaft and a separate idler gear axis in the 
reverse path. US-A-3769857 discloses an arrangement 
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. 
DE-A-1655663 discloses a similar arrangement. A power transmission in accordance with the 
present invention is characterised over US-A-3769857 
by the features specified in the characterising 
portion of Claim 1. A transmission incorporating the present 
invention has a forward power path and a reverse power 
path, both of which use a common one-way driving 
member and separate input gears in the final drive  
 
assembly. The transmission deploys an input shaft and 
two countershafts which support the gears and clutches  
 
in a manner to minimise the overall axial dimension of 
the transmission. It is therefore an object of this invention 
to provide a power transmission having a common 
one-way drive member operable in both a forward ratio 
and a reverse ratio. The present invention may also provide a 
power transmission having four forward speeds and one 
reverse speed, wherein the axial length of the 
transmission is accommodated in the axial space 
required by four gear meshes and four fluid operated 
clutches. The present invention may further provide a 
power transmission having a low forward power path 
including a one-way drive device, a fluid operated 
clutch and a final drive input gear, and a reverse 
power path including the one-way
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

vehicle drive wheel; forward low ratio drive 

establishing means for providing a power transmitting 
path between the input means and the output means 

including an input gear (24) drivingly connected with 
the input means, one-way drive transmitting means (36) 

having an input member (34) and an output member, and 
forward clutch means (40) selectively operatively 

connectable between the output member and the output 
means to establish a forward low ratio drive path; and 

reverse ratio drive establishing means for providing a 
power transmitting path between the input means and 

the output means including the input gear, the one-way 
drive transmitting means, a reversing gear means 

(46,50;82,84) drivingly connected with the output 
member, and reverse clutch means (64) selectively 

operatively connectable between the reversing gear 
means and the output means to establish a reverse 

ratio drive path; characterised in that the output 
means comprises first output means (42) and second 

output means (68); wherein the first output means 
establishes the forward low ratio drive path and the 

second output means establishes the reverse ratio 
drive path.
