<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, 
such as an ECL (emitter coupled logic) circuit and a burn-in 
method thereof. Here, the burn-in implies an activation 
of a circuit prior to an actual operation in order to 
stabilize the circuit characteristics and to find a defective 
circuit at the initial stage thereof. The circuit configuration and function of the ECL circuit 
will be described first, that is an example for which a 
conventional burn-in method has been applied and the burn-in 
method of the present invention will be applied. Fig. 16 shows an example of the ECL circuit. In this ECL 
circuit provided with an OR/NOR gate for three inputs A, B and 
C, when any one of the three inputs A, B and C becomes high 
beyond a reference potential Vref1 (determined as a circuit 
threshold value), only one transistor (whose input is high) 
of three transistors Q7a, Q7b and Q7c is turned on and the 
remaining other transistors and a transistor Q6 are all turned 
off, so that a current ICS of a constant current source 60 
flows through only one current path (the turned-on transistor) 
of three current paths P1, P2 and P3. Therefore, a potential 
at a node NZ becomes higher than that at a node /NZ, so that 
an output Z of the ECL circuit changes to an "H" (High) level 
by an emitter follower output stage composed of a transistor 
Q5a and a resistor Ra2, and another output /Z of the ECL 
circuit changes to an "L" (Low) level by another emitter 
follower output stage composed of a transistor Q5b and a 
resistor Rb2. On the other hand, when all the three inputs A, B and C 
are low below the reference potential Vref1, the transistors 
Q7a, Q7b and Q7c are turned off and the transistor Q6 is turned  
 
on, so that the current ICS of the constant current source 60 
flows through the current path P4. Therefore, a potential at 
the node NZ becomes lower than that at the node /NZ, so that 
the output Z of the ECL circuit changes to the "L" level by 
the above-mentioned emitter follower output stage, and the 
other output /Z of the ECL circuit changes to the "H" level 
by the other emitter follower output stage. As described 
above, a logical sum (= A + B + C) of three inputs A, B and 
C can be outputted from the output Z of the ECL circuit, and 
a NOT logical sum (= /(A + B + C)) of three inputs A, B and 
C can be outputted from the output /Z of the ECL circuit. 
Further, in the above-mentioned ECL circuit, the reference 
potential Vref1 is set to an intermediate level (e.g., VIM1 = 
(VIH1 + VIL1)/2)
