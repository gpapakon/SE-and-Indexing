<ABSTRACT>
A blood collection assembly includes a tube, which may be glass or plastic, 
and a plastic insert therein. The insert has been plasma-treated to change the 

surface chemistry and render it clot activating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blood collection and,
more particularly, relates to a plastic blood sample collection assembly.Blood samples are routinely taken in evacuated
tubes, such as glass VACUTAINER® brand tubes (Becton, Dickinson and
Company). One end of a double-ended needle is inserted into a patient's vein.
The other end of the needle then punctures a stopper covering the open end of
the VACUTAINER® tube so that the vacuum in the tube draws the blood sample
through the needle into the tube. Using this technique, a plurality of samples can
be taken using a single needle puncture of the skin. Plastic tubes have also been
proposed for blood collection. Plastic offers a number of advantages over glass
such as lower breakage, less weight in shipment, and easier disposal by
incineration.Blood collected in evacuated tubes often must be clotted prior to clinical
examination. It is desirable to form a dense clot as rapidly and completely as
possible to facilitate clean separation of the clot from the serum layer by
centrifugation. To achieve this end, both plastic and glass blood collection tubes
frequently employ a clot activator. Typical activators are diatomaceous earth and
particles of inorganic silicates, or biochemicals such as ellagic acid, thrombin and
thromboplastin. In one line of commercial blood collection tubes, for example, a
coating of silicate particles in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a water soluble polymer)
is affixed to the inside of the tube. When blood enters the tube, the PVP
dissolves and silicate particles are released to initiate clotting. The PVP enters
both the serum and clot.A problem with particulate activators is that finely divided particles must be 
mixed by inversion, may not pellet completely with the clot and may thus
contaminate the serum layer and interfere with certain blood analyses. In
addition, particles suspended in the serum may foul automatic blood analysis
instruments. On the other hand, soluble biochemical activators can be
disadvantageous because these cannot be easily separated from either the serum
or blood clot and can interfere with both chemical and hematological assays. In
particular, for highly specialized applications, such as blood banking., it is
advantageous to avoid either soluble activators or particulates in the cell mass of
a blood clot because these cells are used in blood typing analyses. For this
reason, samples for blood banking are routinely taken in glass tubes and rely on
the clot activating property of the glass to induce clotting.There is
