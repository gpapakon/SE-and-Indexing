<ABSTRACT>
A short circuit detector circuit (10) for detecting when 
a sensor (2), such as a tachometer sensor in automotive 

applications, is operating normally and when the sensor is 
short circuited is disclosed. The detector circuit (10) 

comprises a reference signal input (16) for receiving a 
reference signal, and a closed loop (22, 24, 12, 14, 26, 34, 

32) having a predetermined loop gain (K). The closed loop 
has a first input coupled to the reference signal input, a 

first output (12) coupled to drive the sensor with a signal 
dependent on the input signal and the predetermined loop 

gain, a second input (14) for receiving a feed back signal 
from the sensor and a second output (36) coupled to the first 

input for providing an output response signal dependent on 
the operation of the sensor. The value of the predetermined 

loop gain is selected so that the output response signal is 
an undamped oscillation for normal sensor operation. The 

detector circuit (10) further comprises means (4, 50, 52, 54, 
56,. 58, 60) for analysing the output response signal and for 

detecting normal sensor operation when the output response 
signal is an undamped oscillation and for detecting short 

circuit sensor operation when the output response signal is a 
damped oscillation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a short circuit detector for 
sensors. In many systems which have sensor networks for sensing 
system operating parameters, filters are used in the sensor 
networks in order to optimise the operation of the network: 
for example, to ensure good noise immunity and to limit the 
voltage supplied from the sensor. The latter is particularly 
important for tachometer (tacho) sensors in automotive 
applications. Typically, the time constants of the inductive 
and capacitive sensors of the networks are low compared to 
that of the filters. For these applications therefore, the 
sensors require close monitoring in order to ensure their 
proper operation. By monitoring the DC current flowing through the sensor, 
it is possible to determine whether the sensor is tied to 
ground, tied to the power supply or whether the sensor is 
disconnected. However, this type of monitoring does not 
allow for the detection of a short-circuited sensor due to 
the low internal inductance of the sensor compared to the 
other components in the network. One method of detecting sensor short-circuit is to apply 
a step or Dirac pulse to the network and observe the closed 
loop system response. However for tachometer sensors, such a 
method does not accurately or reliably discriminate between 
the short-circuited or not short-circuited sensor response. 
Furthermore, the time constant of the tachometer sensor, when 
combined with the passive filter components, becomes 
insignificant compared to the other time constants of the 
network.  
 Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide an 
improved short-circuit detector for an inductive or capacitive 
sensor. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a short circuit detector circuit for detecting when 
a sensor is operating normally and when the sensor is short 
circuited comprising: 
a reference signal input for receiving a reference 
signal; closed loop means having a predetermined loop gain, the 
closed loop means having a first input coupled to the 
reference signal input, a first output coupled to drive the 
sensor with a signal dependent on the input signal and the 
predetermined loop gain, a second input for receiving a feed 
back signal from the sensor and a second output coupled to 
the first input for providing an output response signal 
dependent on the operation of the sensor, the value of the 
predetermined loop gain being selected so that the output 
response signal is an undamped oscillation for normal sensor 
operation;
