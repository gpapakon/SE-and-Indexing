<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to the detection of
reverse transcriptase and, more specifically, to the
following: a) detection of such enzymes by allowing
expression of their enzymatic activity followed by the
detection of the resulting DNA; b) identification of
drug-resistant reverse transcriptase mutants in samples;
and/or c) screening of compounds for reverse
transcriptase inhibitory activity.Retroviruses are enveloped viruses with a single
stranded RNA genome in which the virion contains a
reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme essential for viral
replication. All known reverse transcriptases are
multifunctional with three different enzymatic
activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RNase H, and
DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. During retroviral
replication, the first one of these, RNA-dependent DNA
polymerase activity, generates a DNA (cDNA) strand
complementary to the viral RNA. This first step is
followed by the degradation of the original viral RNA
strand by RNase H and then the DNA-dependent DNA
polymerase activity helps generating a second DNA strand 
complementary to the first. This double stranded DNA is
then integrated into the host genome leading to the
ultimate replication of the virus.Since the original discovery of reverse
transcriptase in 1970, and in recognition of its
important role, RT is frequently measured as an
indication of the presence of a retrovirus. Detection
of RT can be very important because this enzyme is a
logical target for anti-viral therapy and, therefore,
anti-viral drug screening can be carried out by RT
detection.One of the challenges facing clinicians in using
anti-viral agents to treat patients is the development
of mutant viruses resistant to those antivirals. The
problem is especially acute in the development of anti-HIV
agents. HIV is the causative agent of AIDS.Thus, it is also important to clinicians to have
the ability to determine whether RT in a clinical
isolate is resistant and to what level to a particular
drug or drugs.RT can be detected directly as by the detection of
certain viruses or indirectly by the detection of
certain nucleic acids. One current method for detecting
RT includes the use of a poly (rA) template and an
oligo (dT) primer, approximately 15-20 nucleotides long,
in presence of tritiated TTP (3H-TTP). After the
formation of the template primer complex, primer
extension is carried out in the presence of tritiated
TTP followed by cold trichloroacetic acid precipitation
of the DNA and RNA. Then, after a centrifugation or
filtration and wash steps,
