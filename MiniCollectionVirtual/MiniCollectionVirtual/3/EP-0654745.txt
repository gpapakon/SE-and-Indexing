<ABSTRACT>
A graphical display which is part of a computer aided 
design system conveys information, such as component 

packaging information related to logic elements to the 
designer. The designer can then use this information and 

the graphical display to communicate requests to the system 
for design changes, such as changing wiring connections to 

take advantage of the component packaging information. 
The graphical display system enables improved user and 
system interaction generally, and more specifically, enables 

electronic circuit designers to perform tasks such as the 
assignment and reassignment of circuit elements to physical 

packages within a physical circuit design system without 
seeking information from outside the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved graphical 
display systems and methods enabling improved user and 
system interaction. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a graphical display system to aid 
computer aided circuit design tasks, such as in the 
assignment and reassignment of circuit elements to physical 
packages (subsequently referred to as partitioning and 
repartitioning) while using a computer aided design (CAD) 
system (subsequently referred to as the design system). A printed circuit board (PCB) is a board on which a 
variety of electrical components may be mounted. These 
various components are connected by conductive strips which 
are printed on the PCB. A PCB may have conductive strips 
printed on one side of the board (single-sided PCB), or may 
have conductive strips on both sides of the board (double-sided 
PCB). There are also multilayer PCBs, in which 
conductive strips are located on several insulated internal 
layers. A key goal of a physical layout designer is the design 
of efficiently manufacturable PCBs that conform to 
specifications for circuit functionality and performance. 
The designer must determine the configuration of the PCB, 
including the location of circuit components, and the 
routing of the conductive strips which will connect the 
various circuit components. The typical process of designing printed circuit boards 
involves a sequence of steps that may include design capture 
followed by design partitioning followed by physical layout. 
Design capture is the process of a circuit designer  
 
providing some specification of the components and behavior 
of a circuit. Most typically this is simple schematic 
capture, the process of defining a schematic diagram of the 
circuit which specifies the set of components or parts of 
the circuit as well as how they are to be logically 
interconnected. Other forms of design capture may include 
behavioral methods where the behavior of the circuit is 
described through a programming language or hardware 
description language. Synthesis tools are then typically 
used to transform this behavioral description of a circuit 
into a more conventional logical circuit description 
corresponding to a schematic diagram. Design capture is 
frequently performed in an unpartitioned mode, where circuit 
elements such as logic gates are used in the circuit 
specification without any reference to how they will be 
physically packaged. For example, dozens of inverters may be 
specified in the schematic without a description
