<ABSTRACT>
A novel human chondromodulin-I protein having a 
molecular weight of about 26,000 dalton on SDS-PAGE and 

capable of stimulating the growth of chondrocytes with or 
without FGF, promoting the differential potency of said 

cells, and inhibiting the growth of vascular endothelial 
cells, a DNA encoding said protein, expression vector 

containing said DNA, a transformant capable of producing 
recombinant chondromodulin-I protein, a process for 

producing chondromodulin-I protein by culturing said 
transformant and a pharmaceutical composition containing 

chondromodulin-I protein as an active ingredient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel human chondromodulin protein. More particularly, it relates to chondromodulin-I protein capable of stimulating the growth of chondrocytes in the presence or absence of fibroblast growth factor an isolated DNA (gene) encoding said protein, expression vectors containing said DNA, transformants capable of producing recombinant chondromodulin-I protein, a process for producing chondromodulin-I protein by culturing said transformants and a pharmaceutical composition containing chondromodulin-I protein as an active ingredient. The present invention also relates to the use of chondromodulin-I protein in the treatment of fracture and various cartilage diseases and as an anti-tumor drug.Almost all the bones of mammalian, except for flat bones such as cranial bone and the like, are formed through a mechanism called "intracartilaginous ossification", which comprises expression of primordial chondrocytes during the embryonic stage, growth and differentiation of said cartilaginous cells, generation of primordial cartilages such as proteoglycagon, collagen II, collagen IX collagen X and the like, infiltration of capillary vessels which is accompanied by the decomposition of ground substance of cartilage and progression of calcification around the vesicles of said ground substance, and the replacement thereof with bone as the final step. Thus, the cartilage metabolism plays a significantly important role in the bone-formation, especially in the elongation of a bone along the axis.It has been known that a variety of hormones and growth factors participate in the bone-formation (osteogenesis) process, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF1, IGF2), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), growth hormone, transforming cell growth factor (TGF-Î²) and the like. It has also been suggested that a certain active factor exists in cartilage, which stimulates the growth and differentiation of chondrocytes. However, there have been no reports which disclose the purification of the factor to such an extent that a single band is obtained on SDS-PAGE, and its definite physiological activity has not been determined. Neam et al. [Peter J. Neam et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry Vol.265, No.17, 9628-9633, (1990)] reported that they separated from bovine cartilage a sugar protein having an amino acid sequence highly similar to that of chondromodulin in the course of their studies for the identification of constitutive proteins in cartilage. However, they still have not elucidated the biological functions
