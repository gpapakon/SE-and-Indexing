A cassette with recording medium, in particular a 
magnetic tape cassette, having a housing (12) and openings 

located therein, which can be closed and exposed by 
means of a displaceable closure member (5), the closure 

member (5) being displaceable in at least one groove in 
the housing (1, 2) by means of at least one web-like 

prolongation (8, 9), the closure member being in at least 
two parts and the parts (26, 27) being interconnectable, 

wherein the parts comprise a substantially flat part (26) 
and an approximately U-shaped part (27), the flat part 

(26) having the at least one web-like prolongation (8, 9) 
for the at least one housing groove (10, 11), wherein an 

additional groove (23), lying parallel to the housing 
groove (10, 11) is provided in the opposite side of the 

housing and wherein the U-shaped part (27) has a long and 
short leg (19 and 20, respectively), of which the long 

leg (19) engages in the housing groove (10) and the short 
leg (20) engages in the additional groove (23). 
A cassette as claimed in claim 1, wherein the parts 
(26, 27) consist of different materials, for example 

metal and plastic or different interbondable plastics. 
A cassette as claimed in claim 1, wherein the parts 
(26, 27) of the closure member (30) are interconnectable 

by means of hook or snap connections (21a-c, 22a-c). 
A cassette as claimed in claim 3, wherein the hook 
or snap connections (21a-c, 22a-c) are arranged within 

the additional groove (23) of the housing (1, 2). 
A cassette as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the parts (26, 27) of the closure member (30) 

consist of interfusible plastics which are incompatible  
 

with the plastics material of the housing (1, 2). 
A cassette as claimed in claim 4, wherein the flat 
part (26) and the U-shaped part (27) are provided with 

bent-off portions (18, 21a-c) which are intended for 
engaging in the additional groove (23) and in the region 

of which the hook or snap connections are provided. 
A closure member for a cassette as claimed in 
claim 1, the closure member being in at least two parts 

and the parts being interconnectable, wherein one of the 
parts (26) is designed substantially flat and with the at 

least one web-like prolongation (8, 9) and the other part 
(27) is designed approximately U-shaped with legs (19, 

20) of different lengths. 
A closure member as claimed in claim 7, comprising 

a design of the two parts (26 and 27) with hook 
and/or snap connections (21a-c, 22a-c). 
A closure member as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein 
the parts (26, 27) consist of different materials, in 

particular of metal and plastic. 
A closure member as claimed in claim 9, wherein the 
parts (26, 27) consist of different plastics materials 

which cannot be bonded by fusing. 
A closure member as claimed in claim 9, wherein the 
parts (26, 27) consist of different, interfusible plastics 

materials.
