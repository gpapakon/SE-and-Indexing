<ABSTRACT>
The invention shows a spraying gun (1, 2) and a paint container (7) for applying paint in hobby work, model construction and similar painting or leisure purposes. By means of an air flow, an air/paint mixture is produced. The paint carrier (12), e.g. a wick, is held by the paint container (7) which is preferably designed in the manner of a cartridge and can be introduced into the spraying gun (1, 2). In order to achieve the fact that the paint container is automatically secured outside the spraying gun against unintentional emergence of paint, provision is made by means of the invention for the paint container (7) to have a closure (15) which, when the paint container is situated outside the gun (1), in its closing position covers the region of the paint carrier which delivers the paint to the air flow, for interacting means (10, 11; 16, 17) to be provided on the one hand on the paint container and/or on the closure and on the other hand on the inner region of the gun (1, 2) receiving the paint container, which means remove the closure (15) from its position closing the paint-delivering region of the paint carrier automatically with the introduction of the paint container into the spraying gun and clear the path of the air flow over this region and, when the paint container is taken out of the gun, bring the closure back into its position closing the paint-delivering region of the paint carrier. The invention furthermore relates to a spraying gun and to a paint container.
