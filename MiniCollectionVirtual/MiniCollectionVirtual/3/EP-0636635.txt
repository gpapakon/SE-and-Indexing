<ABSTRACT>
Spherical monodispersed polymeric particles are 
prepared from vinyl monomers and crosslinking 

polymerizable polyvinyl monomers. More particularly, a 
novel process for producing spherical monodispersed gel 

particles that are about 1-6 µm in size and contain at least 
about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent (based on polymerizable 

vinyl monomer/vinyl polymer) of a polymerizable polyvinyl 
monomer is disclosed. The process comprises the steps of 

combining an isoalkanol solvent, a polymerizable vinyl 
monomer and a crosslinking polymerizable polyvinyl 

monomer under timed and monitored conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
polymeric particles. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a novel process for crosslinking polymerizable 
vinyl monomers with polymerizable polyvinyl monomers in 
order to produce spherical monodispersed polymeric 
particles. Vinyl polymers, such as polystyrenes, are a well 
known class of materials discovered in the laboratory over 
100 years ago. They are light weight, easy to mold and able 
to maintain their dimensions under adverse temperature 
conditions. Because of their favorable properties, these 
materials are used in many commercial applications. Such 
applications include foam insulators, drinking cups and even 
refrigerator doors. Commercial methods have been developed which 
utilize polyfunctional comonomers to crosslink vinyl 
polymers. The resulting crosslinked products are typically 
bulk solids, oddly shaped agglomerated polymeric particles 
or spherical polymeric particles. Often, said crosslinked 
products find use in applications where increased 
dimensional stability and modified viscoelastic properties 
are desired. It has been of increasing interest to prepare 
crosslinked spherical polymeric particles that are 
monodispersed. The monodispersed polymeric particles can  
 
function as calibration standards for microscopy and 
diffusivity measurement techniques as well as carriers for 
bioactive substances which include pesticides and other 
theropeutic agents. Further, crosslinked monodispersed 
polymeric particles mix uniformly in liquids and polymeric 
matrices and therefore can enhance the flow and dispersion 
properties of such mixtures. Better flow and dispersion 
properties favorably affect the processibility and physical 
and surface appearance properties of mixtures which 
contain polymeric particles. The instant invention, therefore, is based on the 
discovery of a novel process for producing crosslinked 
spherical monodispersed polymeric particles. Said 
crosslinked spherical monodispersed polymeric particles 
are about 1-6 µm in size and they often contain at least 
about 0.05 to about 10 weight percent but preferably at 
least about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent (based on total 
polymerizable vinyl monomer/vinyl polymer) of a 
polymerizable polyvinyl monomer. It is noted that the 
crosslinked polymers of the instant invention are often 
referred to as gels. Additionally, novel embodiments of the 
instant invention include the use of a specific dispersion 
polymerization solvent as well as timed and monitored 
add
