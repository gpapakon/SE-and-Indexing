<ABSTRACT>
A steel wire is coated with a ternary alloy of iron, 
zinc and aluminum on an outermost surface thereof. The 

ternary alloy contains 10 to 30 weight percent of aluminum. 
The steel wire is primarily used as material for springs. 

An Fe-Zn-Al ternary alloy coated steel wire production 
method includes immersing a steel wire in a zinc molten bath 

to plate the steel wire with zinc; immersing the zinc-plated 
steel wire in a zinc-aluminum molten bath to form a ternary 

alloy of iron, zinc, and aluminum on a surface of the steel 
wire; and removing am unsolidified zinc-aluminum layer 

depositing on an outer surface of the steel wire while being 
taken out of the zinc-aluminum molten bath to expose the 

ternary alloy on an outermost surface of the steel wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to steel wires formed with an 
alloy coating and a method for producing the same, particularly 
relates to iron-zinc-aluminum alloy coated spring 
steel wires and producing method for the same. Steel wires for spring have been required, except for 
valve springs for use in an automotive vehicle, to principally 
have: 
(1) High formability, and (2) High corrosion resistance. Conventionally, the following spring steel wires have 
been practically used. AISI304 STAINLESS STEEL WIRE FOR SPRING: This wire is 
produced by drawing an AISI304 wire. ZINC-PLATED STEEL WIRE FOR SPRING: This wire is produced 
by plating a high carbon spring steel wire or piano 
wire with zinc and drawing the zinc-plated steel wire, or 
alternatively drawing a high carbon spring steel wire and 
plating the drawn spring steel wire with zinc. IRON-ZINC ALLOY COATED STEEL WIRE FOR SPRING: This wire 
is produced by forming a steel wire with an iron-zinc alloy 
coating. The production of this wire is described in Japanese  
 
Examined Patent Publication No. 55-37590. HIGH CARBON STEEL WIRE FOR SPRING: This wire is also 
called PIANO or MUSIC WIRE, and is widely used for springs. 
This wire has 0.60 to 0.95 weight percent carbon and a high 
tensile strength. According to JIS (Japanese Industrial 
Standards), there are provided ten or more classes for high 
carbon spring steel wires in the above-mentioned range of 
carbon content. Besides carbon, this wire contains 0.12 to 
0.32 weight percent silicon, 0.30 to 0.90 weight percent 
manganese, and a negligible amount of phosphorus, sulfur, 
copper and the like. These spring steel wires have the following disadvantages 
and do not satisfy completely the aforementioned 
Requirements (1) and (2), i.e., the formability and corrosion 
resistance. AISI304 STAINLESS STEEL WIRE FOR SPRING: This wire is 
excellent in corrosion resistance, but poor in formability 
in that there are variations in length of formed coil 
springs. Accordingly, this spring wire does not satisfy 
Requirement (1). ZINC-PLATED STEEL WIRE FOR SPRING: This wire is covered 
with a thick and soft zinc layer, which is likely to gall in 
spring forming, e.g., when forming into a coil spring. 
Accordingly, this wire has poor formability and thus is 
unsatisfactory for Requirement (1). In the aspect of corrosion  
 
resistance, this wire has relatively good resistance 
for red rust, but has poor resistance for white rust. This 
wire gathers white rust at an early stage. Thus, it cannot 
be said that this wire
