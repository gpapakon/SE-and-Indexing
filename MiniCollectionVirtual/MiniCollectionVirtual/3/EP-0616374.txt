<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor light 
detecting device, and specifically to a semiconductor light 
detecting device for monitoring a laser output of a 
semiconductor laser which is mounted on a module having the 
semiconductor laser on it. A semiconductor laser varies in its optical output 
under the influence of heat generation of the device 
itself, the ambient temperature around it, and the like 
even if its driving current is kept constant. As a method for keeping the output of a semiconductor 
laser constant, it is known to control a driving current of 
the semiconductor laser through an automatic power control 
(APC) circuit so that the output current of a light 
detecting device may be kept constant which is disposed 
behind the semiconductor laser as a monitoring light 
detecting device and is irradiated with the light outputted 
from the rear part of the semiconductor laser. The method 
of keeping the output of a semiconductor laser constant in 
such a manner as this is described in Japanese First 
Publication Tokkaihei 5-29712, for example. The APC circuit, for example, is made to monitor the 
output of the semiconductor laser by measuring the average 
output current of the light detecting device in a given 
time period and feed it back into the laser diode driving 
circuit. A PIN photodiode as shown in Figures 1A and 1B, for 
example, is used as the light detecting device for 
monitoring. Figure 1A is a plan view of the photodiode and 
Figure 1B is a cross-sectional view of it. In the Figures, an n--type InGaAs layer 102 and an n--type 
InP layer 103 are formed on an n+-type InP substrate 
101 in that order, and a p+-type diffusion layer 104 which 
acts as an active area is formed in the n--type InP layer 
103. The n--type InP layer 103 is covered with a 
passivation film 105 of silicon nitride, and an opening 106  
 
is formed in the passivation film 105 on the circumference 
part of the p+-type diffusion layer 104, and a p-electrode 
107 formed on the passivation layer 105 is connected with 
the p+-type diffusion layer 104 through the opening 106. An 
n-electrode 108 is formed under the n+-type InP substrate 
101. Light outputted from the rear part of the 
semiconductor laser is irradiated almost all over the face 
of the light detecting device for monitoring which is shown 
in Figures 1A and 1B. Electrons and holes are generated inside the light 
detecting device by irradiation of light. The electrons 
are moved to an n-type domain (the n+-type InP substrate 
101) through
