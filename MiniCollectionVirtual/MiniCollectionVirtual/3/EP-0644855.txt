<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for the extraction of alumina from alumina-containing solid material, particularly the alumina-containing ores known as bauxite. The process comprises: a) providing the material in the form of a slurry (101) in an alkaline solution having a concentration of free caustic therein sufficient at the temperature reached in step (c) to dissolve alumina values, b) classifying (6) the slurry into a fine particle fraction and a coarse particle fraction, c) heating the fine particle fraction (105) to a temperature sufficient to dissolve at least some of the alumina values therein with consequential reduction in the free caustic concentration in the liquid phase of the fine fraction slurry, and d) combining the coarse particle fraction (109) from step (b) with the free caustic-depleted slurry liquid from step (c) at a temperature higher than that reached in the step (c) so as to dissolve at least some of the alumina values in the coarse particle fraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the extraction of 
alumina from alumina-containing solid material, 
particularly the alumna-containing ores known as bauxite. The most important commercial alumina extraction process is 
that known as the Bayer process in which alumina-containing 
ore is digested with an aqueous alkaline solution at an 
elevated temperature to extract from the ore the alumina 
values, i.e. the components of the ore which under the 
extraction conditions are removed from the body of the ore 
and can be recovered by processing in the form of alumina. 
The alumina thereby produced has a wide range of uses 
including as a raw material for the production of aluminium 
by conventional electrochemical processes. In the Bayer process bauxite is digested by an aqueous 
alkaline solution at elevated temperatures, with the rate 
and efficiency of digestion depending upon both the 
temperature used and the concentration of the alkaline 
solution. Usually sodium hydroxide (caustic) is used as 
the alkali and its concentration in the extracting solution 
is usually described in terms of both the concentration of 
total caustic expressed as equivalent sodium carbonate, and 
the concentration of free caustic, again expressed as 
equivalent sodium carbonate. Free caustic is the hydroxide 
which is not associated with the aluminate Al(OH)4, which is 
the dissolved form of alumina. It is highly desirable to 
use a high concentration of free caustic to extract the 
alumina, because the higher the free caustic concentration, 
the more alumina can be dissolved into, or carried away, 
per unit volume of the extracting liquor before saturation 
of the extracting solution is reached. The amount of 
saturation of the liquor is, at least in North America,  
 
expressed in terms of the alumina to caustic (A/C) ratio 
which is the ratio of Al2O3/Na2CO3, where Na2CO3 is the 
concentration of caustic expressed as equivalent sodium 
carbonate. For a spent or unsaturated liquor the A/C ratio 
is around 0.3, whilst for a nearly saturated liquor the 
ratio is around 0.7. The alumina in bauxite generally exists in the form of 
alumina trihydrate (Al2O3.3H2O or gibbsite) and/or alumina 
monohydrate (Al2O3.H2O or boehmite, diaspore). Generally, 
alumina trihydrate is the main alumina component. The 
difference in solubility between the trihydrate and the 
monohydrate in aqueous alkaline solutions requires 
different conditions in the digestion process. Alumina monohydrate is not as easily dissolved as alumina 
trihydra
