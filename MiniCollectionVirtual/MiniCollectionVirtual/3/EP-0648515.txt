<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is an antenna for microwave heating of tissue as well as a catheter comprising one or more of these antennas. This antenna, intended to be inserted into a cavity or duct, natural or made for the requirements of a treatment, in a living body, in particular a human body, characterised in that it principally consists of at least one radiating delay line (3, 3') arranged at the free end of a supply line (4) and each formed by a strip of conductive material, also allowing, alternately with heating of tissue, reception of thermal noise signals from the heated tissue in a frequency band of 2 GHz to 4 GHz, with a view to determining temperature by radiometric measurement.

Antenna for microwave heating of tissues, which is
designed to be inserted in a cavity or a duct which is

natural or is created for the needs of a treatment of a
living body, and in particular a human body, which antenna

consists of two radiating retard lines (3, 3') with a
helical structure, which have opposite directions of

winding starting from their respective adjacent ends (6,
7), and are fitted in a contiguous manner, the said

portions of helical conductor (3, 3') being connected at
the level of their adjacent ends (6, 7) to two conductors

(9 and 9'), their mutually opposite ends not being
connected, such as to constitute a radiating dipole, which

antenna is 
characterised in that
 the two radiating retard
lines (3, 3') are fitted on supports (5, 5') in dielectric

devices, the longitudinal axes (8) of which are combined,
and are in the form of two distinct portions of strips of

conductive material which is supplied at its centre, and
are disposed at the level of the free end of a supply line

(4) whilst being connected to the two conductors (9, 9') of
the latter, thus forming a dipole which is supplied at its

centre, the said antenna (1) also permitting, in alternance
with the heating of the tissues, receipt of signals and

thermal noise of the tissues heated, in a frequency band of
2 GHz to 4 GHz, for the purpose of determination of the

temperature by radiometric measurement.
Antenna according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the two portions of helical conductor (3 and 3') have
identical lengths and structures.
Antenna according to either of claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that
 each portion of helical conductor (3, 
3') consists of a strip made of a conductive material, the

width, winding pitch, winding diameter and number of turns
formed of which are determined according to the form of the

radiation diagram and of adaptation of the antenna to the
required frequency.
Antenna according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

the length of the portions of helical conductor (3 and 3')
is determined for the purpose of optimal adaptation of the

retard lines for a frequency of 915 MHz or 434 MHz at
emission and similarly on a frequency band of 2 to 4 GHz at

reception.
Antenna according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the radiation diagrams at emission
and reception are combined, or at least concentric.
Antenna according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the supply line (4) consists of a
transmission line with a coaxial structure.
Antenna according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the portion of conductor (3) which
forms the first radiating retard line is wound on a winding

support (5) in the form of a hollow tubular mandrel with a
variable cross-section.
Antenna according to claim 6 and claim 7,

characterised in that
 the hollow tubular mandrel (5) is
partially fitted onto a bare end portion (10) of the

central filar conductor (9) of the coaxial transmission
line (4) and comprises a radial aperture (11) for the

passage and connection of the end (6) of the helical
conductor portion (3), forming a first radiating retard 

line, on the said bare portion (10) of the said central
filar conductor (9).
Antenna according to any one of claims 6 to 8,

characterised in that
 the portion of the helical conductor
(3') which forms a second radiating retard line is wound on

the external sheath (5') of the coaxial transmission line
(4) and is connected to a bare end portion (10') of the

external tubular conductor (9') of the latter.
Antenna according to any one of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the radiating retard lines (3, 3')
are covered with a sheath (12) made of a heat-shrinkable

dielectric material.
Antenna according to claim 10, 
characterised in that

the heat-shrinkable sheath (12) covers in a sealed manner
all of the free end of the supply line (4) which supports

the retard lines (3, 3'), an element (13) in the form of a
stopper, onto which the sheath (12) is applied by being

shrunk after being heated, thus sealing the said sheath
(12) on the front of the said free end of the said supply

line (4).
Antenna according to any one of claims 1 to 11,

characterised in that
 the radiating retard lines (3, 3')
are supplied in a separate manner by signals which are out

of phase with one another, the said phase displacement

Probe according to claim 13, 
characterised in that

continuous sleeve of thermostatting liquid which surrounds
directly the radiating parts (2) at least of the said

antenna.
Probe according to claim 13, 
characterised in that
 it

support structure (14, 15, 15') which permits simultaneous
