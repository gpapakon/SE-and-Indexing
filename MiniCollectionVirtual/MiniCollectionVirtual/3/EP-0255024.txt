<ABSTRACT>
The cutter has a U-shaped or L-shaped supporting frame (1) which can be supported in a height-variable fashion on a stand and on the support frame limbs (2), (3) of which cutting tools, constructed especially as rigid cutting blades, that can be moved in an oscillating manner by a drive member are mounted. In order to transmit the drive movement of the drive member of a cutting tool (5) at the side and/or at the front, a drive body (6), (8), (9) is provided which can be supported in a swivelling fashion on the support frame limb (2), (3) about an axis that is essentially aligned transverse to the direction of the cutting movement of the cutting tool (5).

A silage block cutter with, adapted for vertical 
movement on a chassis, a U- or L-shaped supporting frame on 

the supporting frame members (2, 3) of which and 
constructed in particular as rigid cutters, cutting tools 

(5) are supported and are adapted for oscillating movement 
produced by a driving means (13), whereby to transmit the 

driving movement of a driving member (13) of a lateral 
and/or front cutting tool (5), a driving member (6, 8, 9) 

which can be supported on the supporting frame member (2, 
3) for pivoting movement about an axis orientated 

substantially transversely to the direction of cutting 

movement of the cutting tool (5) is provided in the form of 
an at least two-armed drive lever (6) of which one arm (8) 

can be coupled to the driving member (13) which causes the 
lever (6) to move about its axis and of which the second 

arm (9) which is directed towards the cutting tool (5) can 
be articulatingly connected to the arm (9), characterised 

in that the drive lever (6) is constructed as a gear part 
for amplified transmission of the driving movement force of 

the driving member (13) and in that the arm (9) of the 
drive lever (6) which can be articulatingly connected to 

the cutting tool (5) has a shorter length than the arm (8) 
associated with the driving member (13). 
A silage block cutter according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the cutting tools (5) of different 

supporting frame members (2, 3) have a common driving means 
by which they can be coupled via the drive members (6) for 

drive transmission, the drive members (6) of cutting  
 

tools (5) of adjacently disposed supporting frame members 
(2, 3) are capable of being positively connected in the 

transition zone of the members (2, 3). 
A silage block cutter according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that substantially hemispherical joint 

sockets into which corresponding hemispherical arm ends of 
the drive levers (6) engage are constructed in the lateral 

and in the front cutting tools (5) as well as in parts (11, 
15) which can be connected to a drive lever (6). 
A silage block cutter according to one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the drive member (6) is subject to 

a substantially vertical effect of the associated drive 
means. 
A silage block cutter according to one of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that a three-armed drive lever is 

associated at least with the front cutting tool (5). 
A silage block cutter according to one of claims 1 to 
5 with cutting tools (5) constructed as double cutters 

having cutter bars adapted for movement in relation to one 
another, characterised in that both cutter bars of one 

cutting tool (5) have oppositely pivotable drive members 
(6) adapted to be positively coupled to one another. 
A silage block cutter according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the first cutter bar of a lateral cutting 

tool (5) of a three-armed drive lever associated with the 
drive member (13) and the second cutter bar of the lateral 

cutting tool (5) has a two-armed drive lever which can be 
articulatingly connected to the three-armed drive lever.  

 
A silage block cutter according to claim 6 or 7 
having a U-shaped supporting frame, characterised in that 

the two cutter bars of the front cutting tool (5) have in 
each case a drive member adapted to be coupled to the drive 

means (13) via a connecting part (15), one drive member 
being capable of being connected to the drive member of one 

cutter bar of a lateral supporting frame member while the 
other driving member can be connected to the driving member 

of a cutter bar of the oppositely disposed lateral 
supporting frame member. 
A silage block cutter according to one of claims 1 to 
8, characterised in that all cutter bars (5) can be driven 

by one common drive means (13) and in that the drive member 
(6) of the cutter bars (6) of the front supporting frame 

member (2) engages a connecting joint (15). 
A silage block cutter according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a double acting 

working cylinder (13) is provided as the driving means. 
A silage block cutter according to claim 10, characterised 
in that the working cylinder (13) is supported on a 

supporting frame member (2) and projects in the plane of 
the members and substantially at right-angles to the 

member (2). 
A silage block cutter according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that each supporting 

frame member (2, 3) is constructed as a substantially 
panel-like housing with an inner space for the enclosed 

accommodation of moving parts carried by it and from the 
under side of which the edges of the cutter bars protrude.
