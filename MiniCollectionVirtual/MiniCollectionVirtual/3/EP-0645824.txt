<ABSTRACT>
It is the object of the invention to suppress noises 
caused by reflections of a ray of light from a light receiving 

surface of a photodiode chip and inner and outer surfaces of a 
glass in a semiconductor light receiving apparatus. A 

construction of a light receiving apparatus is that, a photodiode 
chip 4 is mounted on a carrier 2 fixed to a stem 1, and a chip 

4 is sealed up by a cap 7, which is provided with an opening 7a 
covered with glass 8. A ray of light transmits through an 

opening 7a, and incidents on a light receiving surface of a chip 
4. A light receiving surface of a chip 4 and an outer 

surface of a glass 8 are inclined to the optical axis, where 
directions of inclinations are different to each other. An 

angle of inclination of a chip 4 is selected such that reflected 
rays from a chip 4 does not incident on an opening 7a. 

Accordingly, there is no ray which returns to a light source (not 
shown), and generation of delayed incidences to a chip 4 ca be 

prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor light
receiving apparatus, and more particularly to, a semiconductor
light receiving apparatus used for optical communications and
optical measurements, which prevents reflections of an incident
light on its way to a semiconductor photodiode chip.A semiconductor light receiving apparatus plays
important roles in fields of optical communications and
measurements as a photoelectric converting apparatus. A
typical construction of a conventional semiconductor light
receiving apparatus is that, a photodiode chip such as PIN-photodiode
is mounted on a carrier, which is fixed to a stem as
one body, and a cap seals up these element and is fixed to a
stem. A cap has a flattened top and is provided with an
opening at a center of a top. This is covered with a plate
formed glass. In most cases, outer and inner surfaces of a
glass and a light receiving surface are parallel to each other,
and an input ray of light incidents normally to these surfaces.In this construction, a portion of a ray is reflected
at both surfaces of a plate formed glass and a light receiving
of a photodiode chip. Consequently, a portion of an input ray
returns to a light source. Moreover, when multiple
reflections of a ray along a light path cannot be neglected,
other portion of an input ray is converted into delayed 
incidences to a light receiving surface of a chip. These
phenomena become causes of noises of an output signal of a
semiconductor light receiving apparatus.JP-A-62 224 088 discloses a semiconductor light receiving
apparatus according to the precharacterizing part of claim
1. In this state of the art the directions of inclination
of the outer surface of the plate formed transparent material
and of the light receiving surface of the photodiode
chip are parallel to each other.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to
provide a semiconductor light receiving apparatus which is free
of noises caused by reflections of rays of light from the light
receiving surface of the photodiode chip and outer and inner
surfaces of the glass.This object is achieved by a semiconductor light receiving
apparatus according to claim 1. The dependent claim is
related to a further development of the present invention. The invention will be explained in more detail in
conjunction with appended drawings, wherein:
Figs. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of a conventional
semiconductor light receiving apparatus,Fig. 2 shows a cross-sectional view of an improved 
conventional semiconductor light receiving
