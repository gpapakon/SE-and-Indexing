<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive has a fall detection and protection control system (40) 
that detects when a disk drive is in a free fall, and takes precautionary 

protective action to minimize physical damage from any resulting shock upon 
impact. The disk drive includes an accelerometer device (42) that measures 

acceleration of the disk drive along three mutually orthogonal axes x, y, and z 
and resolves the measurement into respective vectors a
x
, a
y
, and a
z
. In one 
embodiment, a processor (52) is programmed to (a) compute a net acceleration 

a
net
 of the disk drive, (b) compare the net acceleration a
net
 with the selected 
acceleration threshold level, (c) measure a duration that the net acceleration a
net
 
exceeds the acceleration threshold level, (d) compare the measured duration 

with a selected reference time period, and (e) output the warning signal when 
the measured duration exceeds the reference time period. Upon receipt of the 

warning signal, a controller (50) initiates protective routines in preparation for 
shock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disk drives, and more particularly, to such
drives and associated methods for minimizing shock-induced damage.Conventional disk drives employ a servo system which controls the
radial position of an actuator arm relative to a rotating recording disk. The actuator
arm supports a read/write head or transducer in cantilevered fashion above the
disk. Ideally, the read/write head is maintained over the center of a selected track
in the disk surface. The read/write head senses position information from the track,
which is then used to develop a position error signal. The error signal is fed back
through a compensator into a drive motor for the actuator arm to move the
read/write head in a direction to reduce the error.At one time, disk drives were employed primarily within immobile
computers, where the disk drives sat motionless within the computer on a desktop
or table. There was little likelihood that these drives would experience an immense
shock from being dropped or severely jolted. Most external disturbances were in
the form of vibrations which could, if sufficient in strength, cause the disk to move
relative to the read/write head, resulting in an off track error.Today, an increasing percentage of disk drives are being used in
portable computers, such as laptops, notebooks, and palmtops, and other portable
devices. A primary problem associated with contemporary designs of such disk
drives concerns shock-induced damage created by the impact of a falling portable
device colliding with a surface. For example, when a palmtop computer containing
a small disk drive (such as a 1.3 inch disk drive) falls from a desk or user's hand
onto a hard floor, the shock pulse magnitude generated at impact can be hundreds
or thousands of g's.The external shock yields two undesirable outcomes: physical
damage and track misregistration. With respect to the first, the shock pulse may
cause significant physical damage to the disk drive. A pulse of sufficient 
magnitude and orientation can overcome the air gap bearing which separates the
slider from the rotating disk, thereby damaging the magnetic media film, the disk
substrate, or the slider.With respect to the second, the external disturbance imposes linear
and radial accelerations that apply a moment to the actuator arm. This moment
may exceed the tracking servo systems ability to maintain the read/write head
within the allocated tracking error range required for acceptable data integrity. This
problem is exacerbated by increased track density which
