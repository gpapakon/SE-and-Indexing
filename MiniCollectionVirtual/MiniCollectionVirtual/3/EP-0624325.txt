<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a finger-shaped, brush-type tool, consisting of individual elements (3) which are held together in a tuft-like manner, such as wire bristles, corrugated steel wires, grinding segments, plastic bristles, grinding-agent-coated plastic bristles or the like, which are held together at one end region by a holding element (1), for example an enclosure, preferably for equipping cutting surface processing machines. The held-together end regions of the individual elements (3) are held at least in a non-positive manner in a cup-like holding element (1) which contains a cured casting compound and consists of a tubular part (4) and a base (5) at the end.
