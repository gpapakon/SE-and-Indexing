<ABSTRACT>
The application describes a process for thermal treatment of contaminated particles, in which the contaminated particles are deposited in a layer having a uniform thickness, are heated by infrared radiation, the organic compounds are burned with the aid of a gas containing oxygen and the particles are calcined. An apparatus for implementing the process, comprising a transportation system (20) of adjustable speed, a furnace (oven) (10) equipped with infrared emitters (30) and injectors (48) for a gas containing oxygen which are located close to the surface of the transportation belt (20).
