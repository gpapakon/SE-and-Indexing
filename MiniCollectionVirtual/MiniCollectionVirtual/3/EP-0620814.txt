<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns novel compounds of general formula (I) wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen or lower alkyl; wherein Ar are the same or different and selected from (II) and (III) wherein R3 is halogen or hydrogen. n is 2 or 3, X is nitrogen or methine. When X is nitrogen Y is methylene. When X is methine Y is selected from nitrogen or oxygen. A is selected from the carboxylic derivatives (IV) and (V) wherein R4 and R5 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl. Z is selected from sulfur or oxygen. R6 is selected from (VI) and (VII) wherein m is 1, 2, 3 or 4. R7 is selected from hydrogen or lower alkyl, and the pharmacologically active salts thereof. The new compounds are useful for treating mental disorders.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is an urgent need for efficient drugs in the treatment of mental disorders which are
more effective and which have fewer side effects than the drugs in clinical use today.
Antipsychotic drugs in current use produce a range of troublesome extrapyramidal
movement disorders (e.g. acute dystonic reactions and tardive dyskinesia) and are poor in
ameliorating the negative symptoms (e.g. restricted or blunted emotional arousal) of
schizophrenia. The main disadvantage of the antidepressants is that they fail to alleviate
depression in 30 to 40 % of patients. Anxiolytics are commonly associated with addictive
properties.Various piperazine derivates pharmacologically active in the central nervous system are
known in the art. Some representative examples can be mentioned. CA 1237128 discloses intermediates for preparing N,N,2,3,4,5,6-substituted -1-piperazinecarboxamides
and acid addition salts thereof. The present compounds differ from
those of CA 1237128 inter alia through the meaning of - X - Y -.WO, A2, 9107967 discloses use of an N-alkyl-piperazinealkanamide for preventing and/or
limiting reperfusion damage upon reperfusion of an organ or a muscular tissue. The present
compounds differ from those of WO, A2, 9107967 in that the piperazine moiety is
substituted directly by the - C (=Z) - moiety.US, A, 4766125 discloses certain N-aryl-piperazinealkanamides useful for protecting hearts
from myocardial injury. The present compounds differ from those of US, A, 4766125 in that
the piperazine moiety is substituted directly by the - C (=Z) - moiety.EP, A2, 0285219 discloses particular N-aryl-piperazinealkanamide derivatives for improving
sleep and treating sleep disorders. The present compounds differ from those of EP, A2,
0285219 in that the piperazine moiety is substituted directly by the - C (=Z) - moiety.EP, A1, 0243903 discloses certain -4-{alcyl}-piperazines being substituted 1-{ω- [bis(phenyl)-alkoxy]-alkyl}-4-{alkyl}-piperazine,
-4-{alkenyl}-piperazine and -4-{alkinyl}-piperazine.
The present compounds differ from those of EP, A1, 0243903 through the
meaning of R6. The US patent 4308387 discloses amperozide which has shown useful antipsychotic
properties in clinical investigations. Amperozide has a limbic profile or action.
See Table 1 below for comparison between Amperozide and present compounds
