<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a door-holding device (1) for vehicle doors (6), with a door-holding hinge (2) fastenable at one end in an articulated manner to a vehicle spar and with a holding part (8) to be fastened to the door. The holding hinge (2) and the holding part (8) are connected to one another so as to be relatively moveable via a catch device (10) defining specific pivoting positions of the vehicle door (6). The catch device (10) has, on the one hand, a strip-shaped catch rail (20) with catch recesses (24) formed on a first longitudinal edge (22) and, on the other hand, a catch roller (26) which is guided in a rolling manner via the first longitudinal edge (22) and cooperates with the catch recesses (24) and is loaded with a spring force (F) in the direction of the catch rail (20). The catch rail (20) is supported on an abutment (38) counter to the spring force (F) by means of its second longitudinal edge (36) located opposite the catch recesses (24) and the catch roller (26).
