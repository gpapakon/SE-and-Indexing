<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electromagnetic operated fuel injectors of 
the type used in the fuel systems of internal combustion engines that 
power automotive vehicles, especially to the dynamic flow calibration of 
such fuel injectors. It is known to calibrate a fuel injector's dynamic flow by selectively 
setting the degree of compression of a spring that acts on the armature. 
This is because the dynamic flow is a function of the response time of the 
fuel injector, and the response time of the fuel injector is in turn a function 
of the degree of spring compression. In a top-feed type fuel injector, such 
calibration is accomplished by using a hollow tube to compress the spring 
while the flow is being measured, and then staking the tube in place after 
the desired flow has been attained. The use of a hollow tube allows the 
liquid fuel to be fed through the means of adjustment and does not require 
any sort of fluidic seal. A bottom-feed type fuel injector is dynamically 
calibrated by using a solid adjusting pin to compress the spring, but a fluid 
seal is required to contain the fuel since the fuel inlet to the fuel injector is 
located closely adjacent the fuel outlet from the fuel injector. In many automotive vehicles, the increasing scarcity of available 
space within the engine compartment has created a demand for 
miniaturized fuel injectors. The ability to decrease the size of a top-feed 
fuel injector is limited by the requirement that the size of the fuel hole 
through the adjusting tube be large enough to accommodate the 
maximum fuel flow without imposing an unacceptable restriction to that 
flow. While a bottom-feed fuel injector that is dynamically calibrated in the 
manner described above requires no fuel hole through the adjusting pin, it 
is necessary that a sealing means be provided around the calibration 
means. Such a sealing means occupies space and therefore inhibits the 
ability to miniaturize that type of fuel injector.  
 US-A-4 949 904 discloses a method for dynamic flow calibration of 
a fuel injector which has a body containing an actuating mechanism 
comprising a selectively energizable solenoid coil assembly that operates 
a valve element via an armature means to selectively seat and unseat 
said valve element on and from a valve seat on said body to selectively 
open and close the fuel injector to fuel flow, said solenoid coil assembly 
comprising a selectively energizable solenoid coil for generating magnetic 
flux and a stator for conducting the magnetic flux to said
