<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic assay for detecting the presence of an infectious herpes virus in a specimen and a genetically engineered cell line for use in such assay are disclosed. The cell line used in the assay expresses a reporter gene only if infectious herpes virus is present in the specimen. The assay involves inoculating a DNA-transfected cell line with a specimen suspected of containing a herpes virus, allowing a sufficient period of time for the herpes virus infectious cycle to proceed, and detecting and quantifying the number of herpes virus-infected cells to determine the number of infectious herpes virus virions in the specimen. The cell line is a DNA-transfected cell line susceptible to infection by a herpes virus which is stably transformed with a chimeric gene comprising a herpes virus inducible promoter and a gene coding for an enzyme, the expression of the enzyme being dependent upon and quantitatively proportional to the presence of herpes virus. A kit for such assay is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the field of
diagnostic virology and, more particularly, to a method for
detecting infectious herpes virus in a specimen and a cell
line for use therefor.Herpesviruses have become increasingly important
causes of human morbidity and mortality. Whitley, R.J.,
Virology (1990) New York, Raven Press. Herpes simplex
viruses Type 1 and 2 (hereinafter referred to collectively
as HSV), in particular, infect a large number of
individuals each year. Primary infection of
immunocompetent patients with HSV usually leads to a
mucocutaneous syndrome such as herpes labialis or herpes
genitalis, the latter being one of the most common sexually
transmitted diseases today. Infection with HSV can also
cause more serious infections, the most serious of which
are sight-threatening keratitis and life-threatening
encephalitis. Moreover, HSV related disease in 
immunocompromised individuals such as newborns, leukemia
patients, organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients has
become an increasingly prevalent and difficult problem.Significant advances have been made in the treatment
of HSV infections in the past decade. These advances in
antiviral therapy have expanded the role of the diagnostic
virology laboratory and have identified the need for more
sensitive, accurate and rapid diagnostic tests to assist in
the early diagnosis of HSV infections.Various tests are presently available for the
diagnosis of HSV infections. Most involve the detection of
viral antigens or intact infectious virus. Antigen
detection assays offer the advantage of rapidity and
specificity, but can lack the necessary sensitivity.
Kowalski, R.P. and Gordon, Y.J., Ophthal. (1989) 96:1583-1586.
The most reliable test to detect infectious herpes
virus involves inoculation of specimens onto tissue culture
cells followed by detection of infectious virus by
microscopically observing a characteristic cytopathic
effect. Although HSV is a relatively easy virus to culture
as it replicates on a wide variety of continuous cell
lines, virus propagation in tissue culture can be slow and
expensive. Recently, improved techniques have- been
developed for the detection of viruses from clinical
specimens. The shell vial technique, for instance, has
greatly increased the sensitivity and the rapidity of HSV
detection. When this method is combined with antigen
detection by immunohistochemistry, HSV can be positively
identified within 24 hours in the majority of cases.
