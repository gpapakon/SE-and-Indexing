<ABSTRACT>
The surface maintaining method has the step of 
dehumidifying air present adjacent the snow surface to 

avoid frosting of water content in the air on the 
surface. According to the invention there is provided a 

method of maintaining a snow surface, characterized by 
the step of:

 
   dehumidifying air (AT) adjacent above a snow 

surface (13a) by means of a dehumidifying means (7,28) 
to restrict frosting of water content present in said 

air (AT) on said snow surface (13a) thereby to maintain 
said snow surface (13a) in a good skiing condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of maintaining a snow surface
and an apparatus therefor.According to one conventional method (e.g. the
Japanese laid-open utility model gazette No. 63-113866
and U.S.P. 2,676471, to be hereinafter referred to as
conventional method 1) of forming an artificial snow
surface, water and compressed gas (mainly, air) both
sufficiently refrigerated are sprayed through a
nozzle, such that the sprayed mixture is frozen by
adiabatic expansion at an atmosphere under the
freezing point temperature to be formed into fine ice
particles and then the ice particles are accumulated 
to form a snow surface.According to another conventional method known
from e.g. the Japenese published patent gazette No.
61-31393 (to be hereinafter referred to as the
conventional method 2), ice cubes are prepared and
these cubes are crushed by means of an ice crusher
machine to be rendered into fine ice particles. Then,
these particles are sprayed around to be accumulated
for forming a snow surface.According to a still further conventional method
known from the Japanese laid-open patent gazette No.
56-133566 (to be hereinafter referred to as the
conventional method 3), a weter-receiving bank as an
ice-making bank is constructed along a skiing slope.
Under a below-freezing point temperature, water is
frozen on the ice-making bank to form an ice surface
thereon. Then, this ice surface is crushed off by a
crusher into fine ice particles and concurrently
therewith the ice particles are scattered about onto
the skiing slope beside the ice-making bank to form an
artificial snow surface.According to a further conventional method (to be
hereinafter referred to as the conventional method 4),
an ice layer is formed on a skiing slope by sprinking
water under a below-freezing point temperature. Then, 
the formed ice layer is crushed by means of a roller
equipped with a sieving machine driven on the layer to
form the layer into fine ice particles.The Japanese PCT-laid-open patent application No.
62-503118 (PCT/AU86/00158) discloses a still further
method (to be hereinafter referred to as the
conventional method 5). According to this method,
mixture of water and surface-activating agent is
stirred to foam. And, this foam is laid out on a
skiiing slope to be frozen at a below-freezing point
temperature. Thereafter, a roller is driven on the
frozen foam in order to crush it into ice particles
forming a snow surface.The above-identified PCT application discloses a
further method (to be hereinafter referred to as

<CLAIMS>
A method of maintaining a snow surface (13a) having the step of
dehumidifying air (AT) adjacent above the snow surface by means of a

dehumidifying means (7,28) to restrict frosting of moisture present in said air
on said snow surface, wherein said dehumidifying means includes an

adsorption type dehumidifying unit (28) and a cooling type dehumidifying unit
(7), said adsorption type dehumidifying unit (28) being selectively used when

an ambience temperature is relatively low, said cooling type dehumidifying
unit (7) being selectively used when the ambience temperature is relatively

high.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein in said dehumidifying step,
said dehumidifying means is so controlled as to substantially equate a vapor

pressure of the snow surface (13a) with a water-vaporization pressure of the
air.
An apparatus for maintaining a snow surface in accordance with the method of claim 1 or 2 by dehumidifying air
adjacent above the snow surface by dehumidifying means so as to restrict

frosting of moisture present in said air on said snow surface, wherein said dehumidifying means
includes an adsorption type dehumidifying unit (28) and a cooling type

dehumidifying unit (7) connected in parallel.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein said snow surface (13a) is
disposed inside a housing (1), and the apparatus further includes a damper

mechanism (33) for selectively providing a condition for causing combined air
comprised of the indoor air (AT) and outdoor air to pass through said

adsorption type dehumidifying unit (28) and a further condition for causing the
combined air to pass through an air conditioner (5) having said cooling type

dehumidifying unit (7).
