 GRID COMPOSITE FOR LONGWALL SHIELD RECOVERY IN UNDERGROUND COAL AND TRONA MINESCross Reference to Related ApplicationThis application is related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/675,616, filed March 27, 1991, for a POLYMER GRID FOR SUPPLEMENTAL ROOF AND RIB SUPPORT OF COMBUSTIBLE UNDERGROUND OPENINGS.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a high strength, lightweight polymer grid laminated with a material consisting of a non-woven polyester. It is utilized in underground coal and trona mines in the longwall recovery phase during movement of longwall mining system equipment. It can also be applied as a supplemental roof and rib control product in underground "non-gassy" mines.Background of the InventionThe recent development of polymer grids for the underground coal mining industry has created new alternatives for supplemental ground control practices. The grids utilize strong, lightweight polymers, usually special grades of polypropylene. 

 High tensile strengths and resulting load support characteristics are achieved by molecular orientation of these polymers in the manufacturing process.One of the most important applications of polymer grids as supplemental ground control is in longwall shield recovery. When shields are moved from one face to another, the determining factor in the success of the recovery is the ground control provided by roof support structures along the old face. Whereas primary support is usually provided by roof bolts and cables which run the full width of the panel, supplemental support is often provided by metallic meshes of welded wire or chain-link fence. Lightweight, high-strength polymer grids may replace these heavy, cumbersome metallic meshes, giving the operation increased productivity by decreasing installation time and reducing injury downtime.However, use of polymer grids immediately over the shields during longwall shield recovery has produced potential dangers due to penetration through the polymer grid by large pieces of shale and sandstone of the gob, cutting through the polymer grid. Shield recovery is thereby hampered and mine workers are placed in danger. 

Summary of the InventionBy the present invention, a polymer grid is connected to a grid composite consisting of a polymer grid and a geotextile to provide a longwall screening package for use during longwall shield recovery. The grid composite is formed by use of a polymer grid which is typically heat bonded to an 8.0 oz./yd.2, 100% continuous filament polyester, non-woven needlepunched

I CLAIM:
1. A system for longwall shield recovery, said system comprising: longwall mining equipment for cutting sections of a longwall face of a mine and said longwall mining equipment being advanced for subsequent cuts, a longwall screening package for supporting a roof above the longwall mining equipment during advancement of the longwall mining equipment, said longwall screening package including a grid composite formed of a polymer geogrid secured to a geotextile at interstitial nodes of the polymer geogrid, said polymer geogrid being positioned above and facing caving shields of the longwall mining equipment during longwall shield recovery and the geotextile being positioned facing an overhead gob whereby the geotextile aids in preventing cutting through by the overhead gob of the geogrid located below the geotextile.
2. A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the geotextile is bonded to the polymer geogrid at ribs and the nodes of the polymer geogrid.
3. A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the longwall screening package includes a length of geogrid on at least one side of the grid composite. 


 4. A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the longwall screening package includes a length of geogrid on opposite sides of the grid composite.
5. A method of longwall shield recovery, said method comprising: advancing longwall mining equipment to remove a longwall face until the longwall mining equipment reaches a terminal position, said longwall mining equipment including caving shields located adjacent to an overhead gob, supporting a longwall screening package above the longwall mining equipment during advancement of the longwall mining equipment, and locating a grid composite of the longwall screening package formed of a polymer geogrid secured to a geotextile at interstitial nodes of the polymer geogrid with the polymer geogrid located above and facing the caving shields of the longwall mining equipment with the geogrid being positioned below the geotextile and the geotextile being positioned to face the overhead gob with the geogrid being positioned below the geotextile for aiding in preventing penetration of the gob through the grid composite during longwall shield recovery. 



 6. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the geotextile is bonded to the polymer geogrid at ribs and the nodes of the polymer geogrid.
7. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the longwall screening package includes a length of geogrid on at least one side of the grid composite.
8. A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the longwall screening package includes a length of geogrid on opposite sides of the grid composite.
9. A system for longwall shield recovery, said system comprising: longwall mining equipment for cutting sections of a longwall face of a mine and said longwall mining equipment being advanced for subsequent cuts, a longwall screening material for supporting a roof above the longwall mining equipment during advancement of the longwall mining equipment, said longwall screening material comprising a geotextile, said geotextile being positioned above caving shields of said longwall mining equipment during longwall shield recovery and said geotextile being positioned facing an overhead gob whereby said geotextile prevents falling of the overhead gob onto said caving shields of said longwall mining equipment.
