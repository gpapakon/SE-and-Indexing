<ABSTRACT>
In a traction control device in which an initial 
control torque of an engine is determined in accordance 

with an acceleration of the vehicle, when an excessive 
slipping of driven wheels is detected, a time taken for 

proceeding of the excessive slipping of the driven wheels 
from a large slip state to a small slip state is counted by 

a timer. If such time is smaller than a reference time and 
a gear ratio of the vehicle is of a first gear shift to 

provide a low vehicle speed, it is decided that the vehicle 

is traveling on an upward sloping road, and a lower limit 
value for defining the initial control torque of the engine 

determined in an initial control torque calculating means 
is corrected into an increased value in an initial torque 

correcting means. This prevents the initial control torque 
of the engine from being excessively reduced at the start 

of a traction control. By this construction, it is possible 
to prevent an initial control torque from being excessively 

reduced due to a misjudgment of a friction coefficient of a 
surface of an upward or downward sloping road to insure an 

acceleratability of a vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traction control 
device for a vehicle according to the preamble parts of independent 
claims 1 and 2. A traction control device for the vehicle 
according to the preamble part of claim 1 
is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No.258933/91 
(corresponding to DE-A-4 101 385) 
proposed by the present applicant. When the vehicle including the above prior art 
traction control device is fallen into an excessive 
slipping state during traveling on an upward sloping road, 
it is more difficult to accelerate the vehicle, as compared 
with the traveling on a flat road. Therefore, when the 
vehicle is traveling on such an upward sloping road, a 
friction coefficient of a road surface is misjudged to be 
small, notwithstanding that the actual friction coefficient 
of the road surface is relatively high. As a result, the 
initial control torque of the engine in operating the  
 
traction control device is suppressed to a value smaller 
than an appropriate value and hence, a sufficient 
acceleration may not be obtained. A traction control device according to the preamble part of 
independent claim 2 is known from US-PS 5033002. This document 
discloses a vehicle traction control which, in case an excessive 
slip of the driven wheels is detected, the engine output is 
controlled on the basis of a plurality of parameters; one of these 
parameters is the value Î± of a hill slope which is determined in 
a hill slope estimator. From US-PS 5119299 there is known a slip control system which 
employs a plurality of slip control characteristics which are 
provided in the form of maps. In dependence on the wheel slippage 
one of these maps is selected in such a manner that a map having 
a greater engine speed variation rate with respect to variation 
of an accelerator position is selected while the wheel slippage 
is maintained smaller than a predetermined target slippage and a 
map having a smaller engine speed variation rate is selected while 
the wheel slippage is greater than the predetermined target 
slippage. DE-A-3836680 discloses a circuitry for a vehicle having a traction 
control. This circuitry is arranged to generate traction control 
signals on the basis of sensor signals derived from the driven and 
the non-driven wheels. Upon the occurrence of a positive slip at 
one of the driven wheels or of an acceleration at one of the non-driven 
wheels, the traction control is stopped for a predetermined 
period of time or the sensitivity of the traction control is 
redu
