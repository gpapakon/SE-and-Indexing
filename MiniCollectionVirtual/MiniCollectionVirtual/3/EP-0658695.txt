<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fastener (attaching element) made of plastic which can be inserted into the hole (aperture) of a panel or the like. This fastener comprises a shank (1) which can be inserted into the hole of a panel, and two flexible and opposed tongues (4) projecting laterally from the shank (1) and capable of holding the shank (1) onto the panel via their free ends (4b), whilst the free end (4b) of each tongue (4) is connected to the shank (1) by two elastically deformable ties (5) acting positively on the tongues (4) in order constantly to urge them into a position separated from the shank (1) after they have gone through the hole in the panel. This fastener for example forms a nut and in particular allows panels to be joined together with screws or bolts.

<CLAIMS>
Attaching element of plastics material adapted for example to constitute
a nut and insertable into the aperture (2) of a panel or the like (P), of the

type comprising a shaft (1) and flexible opposite tongues (4) projecting
sidewise from the shaft (1) and retaining with their free end (4b) the

shaft (1) onto the panel (P) after insertion of the shaft into the aperture
(2) of the panel, each tongue (4) being connected with its free end (4b)

to the shaft (1) by at least one elastically deformable bond (5),
characterized in that each bond (5a, 5b, 5c, 5d) extends along a plane

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shaft and exhibits in the rest
position and in axial view a V-shape both legs of which are connected to

each side of the tongue (4) and to the shaft (1), respectively and the tip
(6) of which is directed outwards of the space comprised between the

tongues (4) and the shaft (1) to form a hinge which constantly urges the
tongues (4) into the position spaced from the shaft (1) and which

expands after passing through the aperture (2) of the panel (P).
Attaching element according to claim 1, characterized in that the two
bonds (5a, 5b-5c, 5d) belonging to each tongue (4) and to the shaft (1)

are located in a same plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the
shaft or in a different plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the

shaft.
Attaching element according to claim 1, characterized in that the top
face (3) of the shaft (1) comprises a multiplicity of preliminary holes (7)

opening towards this top face only.
