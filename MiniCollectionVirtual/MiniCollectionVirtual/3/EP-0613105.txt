<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the process consists in   - supplying the same random number to each of the IC cards (C1 and C2); - transmitting a first identity code (ID1) from the first to the second IC card; - transmitting a second identity code (ID2) from the second to the first IC card; - applying, within each of the IC cards, a diversification algorithm (D1, D2) in order to determine a same secret number (NS); - computing a session key common to each of the IC cards using a session key computing algorithm (CC1, CC2).

Process for the control of secret keys between a first and a second
smart card (C1) and (C2), in which a first identity code (ID1) is stored

in the first smart card and a second identity code (ID2) is stored in the
second smart card,

consisting of the following phases:

a personalization phase involving the stages:

writing into each of the smart cards the same group secret key (G),
writing into each of the smart cards an algorithm for processing the
group secret key and identity codes;

a use phase involving the stages:

of transmitting the first identity code (ID1) to the second smart card
(C2),
of transmitting the second identity code (ID2) to the first smart card

(C1),
of transmitting a random number (NA) to each of the smart cards,
of calculating, by processing algorithms, a first and a second session
keys (S1, S2), respectively in the first and the second smart cards,

consisting in each of the smart cards of the stages of:
applying a diversification algorithm (D1, D2) based on the first and
second identity codes (ID1, ID2) and the group secret key for determining

a secret number (NS),
applying an algorithm for calculating the session key (CC1, CC2) on the
basis of the random number (NA) and the secret number (NS).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the diversification
algorithm comprises:


determining a first secret key (NS1) on the basis of the first identity
code (ID1) and the group secret key stored in each of the smart cards,
determining a second secret number (NS2) on the basis of the second
identity code (ID2) and the group secret key,
combining, by a commutative operation, said first and second secret
numbers to obtain the secret number (NS).
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the commutative
operation performed on the first and second secret numbers (NS1, NS2) in

the diversification algorithm is an addition.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the diversification (D1, D2) algorithm and the algorithm for calculating

(CC1, CC2) the session key of the first and second smart cards are
identical, the session keys obtained for the first and second smart cards

then being identical.
