<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synthetic
lubricating oil, particularly a synthetic lubricating oil for
use as a refrigerating machine oil in refrigerating machines
employing a chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbon as the refrigerant.
The invention further relates to a working fluid composition
for refrigerating machines which comprises the lubricating oil
and a chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbon.Compression-type refrigerating machines have
conventionally employed chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants such as
CFC-11 (CCl3F, trichloromonofluoromethane), CFC-12 (CCl2F2,
dichlorodifluoromethane), HCFC-22 (CHClF2, monochlorodifluoromethane),
and CFC-115 (CF3CClF2, monochloropentafluoroethane).
However, the use of chlorofluorocarbons
including CFC-12 has been restricted since they cause ozone
layer depletion. Although HCFC-22 has not been restricted in
its use so far because of its less ability to deplete the ozone
layer, the use thereof will be restricted in the future.As substitutes for these chlorofluorocarbons, chlorine-free
hydrofluorocarbons are coming to be used. Proposed as a
substitute for CFC-12 is HFC-134a (CH2FCF3, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane),
which is similar in thermodynamic 
properties to CFC-12. Proposed as a substitute for HCFC-22 is
a mixed refrigerant which contains HFC-32 (CH2F2,
difluoromethane) and is similar in thermodynamic properties to
HCFC-22.A refrigerating machine oil is required to have various
performances, of which the compatibility with a refrigerant is
extremely important from the standpoints of the lubricity of
the oil and the efficiency of the system. It is, however,
known that chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants
represented by HFC-134a and HFC-32 are almost incompatible with
the refrigerating machine oils conventionally used in
compression-type refrigerating systems, which oils contain a
naphthene-based mineral oil, paraffin-based mineral oil,
alkylbenzene, or the like as the base oil, and that the working
fluids containing such chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbon
refrigerants undergo two-phase separation both in a low-temperature
side and in a high-temperature side.If the two-phase separation occurs, the lubricating oil
is retained in the condenser and expansion device, resulting in
a decrease of the efficiency of refrigeration and in
insufficient supply of the lubricating oil to the slide way in
the compressor. Since the defective lubrication causes
troubles including seizure of the compressor, the refrigerating
machine cannot be applicable to practical use.Under these
