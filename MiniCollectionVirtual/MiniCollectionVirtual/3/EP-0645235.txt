<ABSTRACT>
A process for releasing leachable substances from a 
polymeric contact lens blank (10). The contact lens is confined 

in a cavity within a carrier (44,16) to permit the hydration of the 
lens without permitting it to invert or roll over. A fluid 

flow is introduced into the cavity about the lens to 
extract leachable material from the lens. The process 

significantly reduces the amount of leaching fluid that is 
used and the amount of time that is needed for hydration, 

washing and extraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for removing
leachable substances from polymeric contact lenses, and
more particularly, for hydrating soft contact lenses by
exchanging leachable substances for water, and still more
particularly, for conducting the leaching or hydrating of
contact lenses while maintaining the orientation of the
lens throughout the process to reduce the need for physical
handling of the lens.Soft contact lenses can be made from hydrophilic polymers
also known as hydrogels by many processes, for example, by
molding, spin casting or lathe cutting.During the initial steps of manufacturing hydrogel lenses
by lathe cutting, the hydrogel is maintained in a dry state
so that it may be manipulated on the lathe to cut the
desired optical surfaces. It is then polished, removed
from the lathe, hydrated, inspected and packaged. Spin
cast lenses can be made by subjecting a liquid monomer to a
centrifical force in a mold which has the same shape as the
desired optical surfaces of the lens. As the mold spins,
the monomer is cured to form the lens. The lens is then
typically polished in the mold, hydrated from the mold,
inspected and packaged. Other lenses may be molded from
liquid monomer and catalyst confined in a space between two
mold halves which control the shape of the lens. The
monomer is cured, the mold halves separated and the lens is
hydrated, inspected and packaged. The hydration step in
all of these processes can be time consuming, difficult to
control and somewhat unpredictable so that the 
manufacturing process can be inefficient and sometimes
expensive.In carrying out many of the processes for making contact
lenses, significant amounts of manual handling of the lens
may be required. Handling the lens in the dry state can
dirty or scratch the lens. Handling the lens in the
delicate wet state can cause tears and other
imperfections. It would be particularly useful to have a
lens manufacturing process which would minimize the
handling of the lens.When removing a lens from a final package, a user often has
difficulty orienting the lens properly for placement on the
cornea of the eye. Sometimes the lens inverts or rolls
over so that the user can inadvertently put the wrong
surface of the lens facing the cornea. It would be
desirable to have a process in which one could control the
orientation of the lens throughout the process and
uniformly place the lens in the package so that it could be
consistently removed by the user in the proper orientation
for placement on the cornea. It

A method of transferring a contact lens (10) between processing stations (20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140), said method comprising:
