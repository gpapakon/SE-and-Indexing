<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic machine 
for the production of rounded and/or substantially 
rectilinear bevels at the corners of flat slabs of 
various materials. As is known, in the processing of flat slabs of various 
materials, finishing of both the edges of the slab and 
the corners thereof is often required. In particular 
in the processing of slabs of glass it is necessary to 
carry out grinding of the edges and removal of the 
sharp corners which constitute primary points for the 
start of breakage of the slab. An example of equipment known in the art is disclosed 
into EP-A-126 038 that shows an automatic machine according 
to the precharacterizing part of claim 1. The technical problem which is posed, therefore, is 
that of providing a machine capable of removing a flat 
slab, particularly a slab of glass, from either a 
loader or a continuous production line, and carrying 
out finishing of the sharp corners by rectilinear 
bevelling or by rounding. Within the context of such problem a further need is to 
carry out rounding and bevelling with a preset radius 
of curvature in an automatic manner and without 
limitations, thus making it possible in particular to 
perform with great ease and rapidity rounding with a 
different radius of curvature even on the same slab  
 
without the need for complex machine tooling 
operations. Said results are obtained with the present invention, 
which provides an automatic machine for the production 
of rounded and/or substantially rectilinear bevels at 
the corners of flat slabs according to the characteristics of claim 1. Further details may be obtained from the following 
description, given with reference to the attached  
 
drawings which show: 
In figure 1:the machine according to the invention 
viewed from the front, and In figure 2:the machine in fig. 1 viewed from the 
side.  As illustrated in the figures, the machine according to 
the invention comprises a support frame 10 which has 
rotatably connected to it a conveying device 20 
comprising a counterframe 21 which is hinged at the top 
to the frame 10 by means of hinges 11 with a horizontal 
axis and fastened at the bottom to moving rods 2a of 
cylinders 2 fastened to a crosspiece 12 of the frame 10 
in such a way as to keep the entire conveying device 20 
tilted back with respect to an ideal front vertical 
plane of the machine and rotatable about the hinges 11 
from a lower position to an upper position. The lower end of the counterframe 21 has attached to it 
idle rollers 22
