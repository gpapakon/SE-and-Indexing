<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pouch machines and 
more particularly to an improved cutter apparatus in a 
pouch form, fill, seal machine capable of handling a 
wide range of pouch sizes. It is known to form a pouch by folding a 
flat web longitudinally, transversely sealing the 
doubled web on itself to form a series of open-mouth 
pouches, passing the double web around a filler wheel 
and filling the pouches, sealing the open-mouths to 
form a series of connected sealed pouches, and then 
passing the sealed train of pouches around a cutter 
wheel where the transverse seals are sliced to separate 
individual pouches. This process was carried out 
continuously, or on the run, without stopping for any 
operation. A typical process and an apparatus for 
performing such process are both disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,597,898, which is herewith incorporated 
herein by reference. Among other disclosures in that 
patent is a description of the pouch cut-off or cutter 
apparatus. Such a cutter includes a plurality of 
radially extending knife blades on a cutter wheel, and  
 
another plurality of radially extended blades mounted 
on a separate rotatable slicer in a fashion to cooperate 
with the cutter wheel. The knife blades, when the 
cutter wheel and slicer were turned, came together and 
sheared individual pouches off the series of sealed 
pouches in the web. It should be appreciated that the outer 
edges of the knife blades extending from the cutter 
wheel lie in a circle. Each outer knife edge is 
equi-distant from the other adjacent knife edges, this 
distance generally matching the transverse 
seal-to-seal distance across the pouches. These seals 
are generally parallel and the distance between the 
seal centerlines on each side of a pouch is referred 
to as the "chord". Thus the entire process continues 
with the knives rotating and cutting off pouches at 
their transverse seals. It is not unusual for a product manufacturer 
to run different types of products on a pouch machine, 
using pouches of the same pre-fill design size. One 
type of product might only lightly fill the pouch and 
another type of product might bulge the pouch considerably. Such bulging results in a corresponding 
shortening in the straight line distance between the 
seals which separate each pouch, and more particularly 
in the distance between the center-lines of the seals. 
For pouches of the same pre-fill design sizes, fatter 
or more bulging filled pouches have a shorter chord 
than thinner or less bulging filled packages.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cutter apparatus (22) for a web of filled 
pouches (19) comprising first and second rotary knife means 

(24, 28), the first rotary knife means (24) having a 
plurality of radially extending knife blades (26), and, a 

plurality of pouch guides (70) operatively associated with 
the first rotary knife means (24), characterised in that the 

apparatus includes means (60, 62, 68, 
72, 74, 76) for adjusting all the pouch guides (70) simultaneously in a radial 

direction and independently of the knife 
blades (26) of the associated first rotary knife means (24) 

to accommodate pouches of different chords. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
pouch guides (70) are extensible to a position radially 

outwardly of the outer extension (104) of the knife blades 
(26) of the first rotary knife means (24) and are 

retractable to a position at least radially equal to the 
outer extension (104) of the knife blade (26). 
Apparatus as claimed in either Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, wherein one of the pouch guides (70) is disposed 

adjacent each radially extending knife blade (26) of the 
first rotary knife means (24), each of the guides (70) 

having a pouch engaging surface disposed for movement 
between two positions, and wherein one of the positions is 

extended radially outwardly to at least the same plane as 
a forward edge (104) of an adjacent knife blade (26) and  

 
the other of the positions is extended further radially 

outward of a forward edge (104) of an adjacent knife blade 
(26). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
wherein the second rotary knife means (28) includes at 

least one radially extending knife blade (30) for 
cooperating with the first rotary knife means (28) for 

cutting individual filled pouches from the web (19). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
further comprising a rotatable cage (40) having an axis of 

rotation, the knife blades (26) of the first rotary knife 
means (24) being mounted on, and radially extending from 

the cage (40) for cooperating with the second rotary knife 
means (28) to cut individual pouches from a web of filled 

pouches (19) moving about the cage (40), a screw (62) 
mounted within the cage (40) on the axis of rotation, a 

cone (60) disposed within the cage (40) and mounted on the 
screw (62) for axial movement upon rotation of the screw 

(62), the cone (60) having a conical surface, a plurality 
of axially-extending grooves (76) spaced about the conical 

surface of the cone (60), each of the pouch guides (70) 
being slidably interconnected with one of the grooves (76) 

to move the guides (70) radially in and out, independently 
of the knife blades (26), as the cone (60) moves back and 

forth, and means (45) on the cage (40) for supporting each 
guide (70) in a radial position and blocking axial movement  

 
while permitting radial movement, whereby rotation of the 

screw (62) causes the cone (60) to move axially with 
respect to the cage (40), the axial movement of the cone 

(60) causing radial movement of the pouch guides (70) 
independently of the knife blades (26) to accommodate 

different pouch chords due to either different pouch sizes 
and/or different product fills. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the 
supporting means on the cage includes a drum (44) having a 

plurality of radially extending passages (45) therethrough, 
and wherein the pouch guides (70) are mounted on respective 

guide arms (72), the guide arms (72) extending through 
respective ones of the passages (45) and having radially 

inward ends (74) operably interconnected respectively with 
the grooves (76) in the conical surface. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
further including a plurality of suction cups (84), at 

least one of which is mounted between each radially 
extending knife blade (26) for holding a pouch therebetween 

and further including means (60, 62, 80, 82) for adjusting 
the radial position of the suction cups (84) simultaneously 

with and in response to adjustment of the pouch guides (70) 
in a radial direction. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, further 
including means (84a) for adjusting the radial position of  

 
the suction cups (84) independently of the pouch guides 

(70). 
A method of cutting pouches from a continuous web 
of filled pouches (19) having transverse seals between each 

pouch comprising running the web between two rotary cutter 
means (24, 28), one of which includes a plurality of radially 

extending knife blades (26) and pouch guides (70) adjacent the 
blades (26), cutting through the transverse seals at a shearing 

station between the cutter means, characterised by radially adjusting 
the pouch guides simultaneo
usly and independently of the 
knives to accommodate pouches having different pouch 

chords.
