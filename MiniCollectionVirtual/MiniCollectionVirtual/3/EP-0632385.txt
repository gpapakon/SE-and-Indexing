<ABSTRACT>
A first test circuit (21) is connected to one end 
of a first wiring line (40), and a second test circuit 

(22) is connected to one end of a second wiring line 
(41). The second wiring line (41) serves as a data bus. 

N-channel MOS transistors (50, 51), connected in series, 
are provided between the first and second wiring lines 

(40, 41) and located below a third wiring line (42). 
The transistors (50, 51) are set in an conductive state 

by a gate control signal (TEST) from a test control circuit 
(53) in a test mode, and are set in an OFF state in 

a normal operation mode. In the normal operation mode, 
the capacitance between the first and second wiring 

lines (40, 41) is small and does not adversely affect 
the operation speed of an integrated circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
integrated circuit which includes a test circuit for
testing whether or not the wiring lines of the semiconductor
integrated circuit work normally.Before an integrated circuit is shipped from a factory,
it must be guaranteed that the integrated circuit
does not have any defect. In order to confirm that the
integrated circuit has no defect, it is necessary to
check the integrated circuit by means of a test apparatus.An integrated circuit is fabricated to attain a
certain function, and the test apparatus tests whether
or not the fabricated integrated circuit can attain it.
The integrated circuit is shipped after the test shows
that the integrated circuit does not have any problem.Integrated circuits developed in recent years are
very large in scale, and the functions which have to be
attained by use of a single chip are very complex.
Since the integrated circuits have to be tested in a
large number of points to confirm their functions, the
test requires a very long time, resulting in a delay in
the shipment of the integrated circuits. In addition, a
great expense is required for the test.In order to make the test easily and quickly,
an integrated circuit recently developed incorporates
not only circuit elements for attaining the required 
functions but also test circuits for testing the functions
of the integrated circuit. Although a variety of
test circuits are provided in accordance with purposes,
a test circuit used for checking the wiring lines of a
microcomputer will be briefly described by way of an
example.A comparatively long wiring line, which is
generally referred to as a data bus, is incorporated in
a semiconductor chip constituting a microcomputer. The
circuit elements of the microcomputer exchange data
through the data bus.FIG. 8 shows a conventional microcomputer and
depicts one data bus 12. Referring to FIG. 8, circuit
blocks 1-9, each made up of various circuits, are
arranged on a semiconductor chip 13. Each of the circuit
blocks (C.B.) 1-9 is connected to the data bus 12
by way of an input buffer 10 and an output buffer 11.
To check whether or not the data bus 12 has an electrical
disconnection, the conventional art transfers data
from circuit block 1 connected at one end of the data
bus 12 toward circuit block 7 connected at the other end
of the data bus 12. Then, the conventional art compares
the data transmitted from circuit block 1 with the data
received by circuit block 7. When these two data are
identical to each other, it is
