<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator evaporator (108) is formed in a 
spread serpentine configuration having a plurality of 

straight tube segments (110) and a plurality of bent tube 
segments (112) where each one of the straight tube segments 

(110) is joined at an acute angle to at least one other 
straight tube segment (110). The straight tube segments (110) are 

arranged in a number of planar rows which are adjacent 
and parallel to one another. Approximately 25-50 

percent of the cross-sectional area of the evaporator (108) 
is not occupied by tubing or any attached fins. A 

cross flow blower (122) disposed at one end of the 
evaporator draws air longitudinally over the 

evaporator (108).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to refrigerator
in general and more particularly concerns refrigerator
evaporators having a spread or flared serpentine
configuration wherein adjacent straight runs of the
tubing are not parallel.Household refrigerators typically operate
on the simple vapor compression cycle. Such a cycle
includes a compressor, a condenser, an expansion
device, and an evaporator connected in series and
charged with a refrigerant. The evaporator is a
specific type of heat exchanger which transfers heat
from air passing over the evaporator to refrigerant
flowing through the evaporator, thereby causing the
refrigerant to vaporize. The cooled air is used to
refrigerate one or more refrigerator compartments. A
refrigerator evaporator for vapor compression cycles
must satisfy several functional requirements. The
most important of these are discussed below.First, an evaporator must be thermally
effective; that is, refrigerant flowing within the
evaporator should exist at a saturation temperature
which is not much lower than the temperature of the
air flowing over the evaporator. This is because the
higher the saturation temperature of the refrigerant
is, the greater the efficiency of the refrigeration
cycle will be. Consequently, the evaporator exit
saturation temperature is indicative of the thermal
effectiveness of the system.Next, the evaporator must be effective in
dehumidifying the air being refrigerated. If the air
is not sufficiently dehumidified, then water droplets 
will form on various surfaces in the fresh food
compartment and ice will form on various surfaces in
the freezer compartment. An evaporator dehumidifies
air by condensing air moisture as the air passes over
the evaporator. Thus, air bypass of the evaporator
must be minimized for effective dehumidification.Because condensed moisture forms as frost
or ice on the leading side of the evaporator surfaces,
an effective evaporator must also be able to
accumulate large amounts of ice without producing
substantial air blockage. Ice accumulation on
evaporator surfaces will eventually cause substantial
cycle efficiency degradation. Most refrigerators are
thus provided with a resistance heater which is
periodically activated to defrost the evaporator.
Defrosting energy use is parasitical. Frequent
defrosting results in greater system energy use
because much of the defrost heat is unavoidably
diverted to un-iced surfaces rather than just melting
ice. A desirable evaporator is therefore one which
can accumulate substantial amounts of ice before
def
