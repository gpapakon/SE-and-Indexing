<ABSTRACT>
A method for suspending the urethrovesical 
junction in females comprises inserting sutures through 

a puncture or incision in the suprapubic abdominal area 
or through a puncture or incision in the vaginal wall, 

suspending the urethrovesical junction with the 
sutures, and anchoring the sutures with an anchoring 

means at an anchoring site. The anchoring means is a 
relatively rigid helix having an attaching means to 

attach the suture, or a pad adapted to be delivered 
with a delivery means to the anchoring site, or a flip 

anchor in substantial axial alignment with a placement 
means and adapted to be flipped from the axial 

alignment to an angled position, or an adjustable 
tissue anchor having a means for adjustably attaching 

the sutures. 
A system for positioning an anchoring means in 
living tissue comprises an insertion means primarily 

defined along a longitudinal axis to fit in a surgical 
needle, and an 
anchoring means. 
An anchoring means for anchoring a suture in 
tissue comprises a housing, a substantially cylindrical 

means within said housing for receiving a suture, and 
an adjusting means. Another anchoring means comprises 

a housing, a rotating spool within said housing, a 
driving gear, and an adjusting means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for suspending 
the female urethrovesical junction, also called bladder 
neck, with sutures and an anchoring means to anchor 
said sutures. The invention also relates to systems 
for positioning anchoring means in living tissue. Stress incontinence is caused by increased 
abdominal pressure. One surgical method for treating 
this condition involves suspension of the bladder neck 
for repositioning in the correct fixed retropubic 
position such that there is no voiding of the bladder 
under stress and at the same time bladder outlet 
obstruction is avoided. Four relatively non-invasive 
surgical procedures for bladder neck suspension are 
described in Hadley et al., Urologic Clinics of North 
America, Vol. 12, No.2, p. 291 (1985). In the original 
Pereyra method, a needle is passed from a suprapubic 
incision to an incision in the vagina near the bladder 
neck. Stainless steel suture wire is passed several 
times from the bladder neck to the suprapubic incision 
to suspend the bladder neck. The Cobb-Radge method 
inserts the needle from below through the vaginal 
incision. The Stamey procedure uses an endoscope to 
prevent the surgical needle from puncturing the 
bladder. Dacron vascular graft is used to anchor nylon 
suture in the periurethral tissue. Finally, in the Raz 
method the surgeon inserts his finger through the 
vaginal incision to guide the suspension needle and 
avoid penetration of the bladder by the needle. The 
sutures are anchored by threading through tissue of the 
vaginal wall and tissue in the suprapubic area.  A major problem encountered during surgical needle 
suspension procedures such as described above is the 
correct positioning of the bladder neck and the 
urethra such that the position of the bladder neck with 
respect to the bladder is high enough to avoid 
incontinence under stress while not too high to prevent 
proper bladder voiding. The invention is an improvement over the prior art 
by providing for easy adjustment of the suspending 
sutures to lower or raise the bladder neck during 
surgery, and for readjustment to lower or raise the 
bladder neck, if necessary, after the patient has 
benefited from the suspension procedure. The invention 
also allows for more secure anchoring of the sutures 
without extensive tissue suturing to prevent lowering 
of the bladder neck over time. Furthermore, the 
invention reduces the amount of tissue dissection 
required to place the tissue anchors in proper position. A system for positioning of
