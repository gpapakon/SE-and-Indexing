<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for avoiding the use of specially allocated, temporary roaming numbers in a mobile telephone system for routing outside calls to a mobile subscriber (MS) roaming in the system. According to the invention, an incoming standardized call signal frame (IAM) comprising a first parameter field (Called Party Address) including a directory number (MSN) is reconstructed. The directory number (MSN) in the first parameter field is replaced with the unique routing number (PRN) of the mobile telephone switching centre (MSC/GSM) within whose service area the mobile subscriber (MS) roams. A unique international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) and the directory number (MSN) are inserted in a second parameter field (End Information Transfer, EIT). This implies a static addressing principle in which the routing address will also contain directly the number (MSN or IMSI) of the called subscriber. This facilitates restoration of certain registers (HLR, GLR) after a failure.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD OF RESTRUCTURING A CALL SIGNAL FRAME IN A CELLULAR MOBILE TELEPHONE SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method of restructuring in a cellularmobile telephone system a standardized signal frame arriving at the mobile telephone system, so as to facilitate the routing of calls to a mobile telephone which roams within at least one localization region and store positional infor¬ mation so as to enable the information to be readily restored subsequent to a functional fault in the storage medium.BACKGROUND ARTA public mobile telephone system which is intended to cover a large area requires advanced procedures in order to be able to route a call to a roaming subscriber to the radio base station which is in radio contact with the mobile telephone of the subscriber at that particular moment in time. Since permanent telephone networks and Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN networks) and possibly other public land mobile tele¬ phone networks may be involved in a call, it is important that each point in the system quickly obtains information as to where the roaming subscriber can be paged. Comprehensive signalling is therefore required in order to keep the infor¬ mation in the system updated.Known mobile telephone systems are NMT (Nordic Mobile Tele- phone System) , TACS (Total Access MobileTelephone System) and GSM (Groupe Special Mobile) . NMT and TACS are described, for instance, in CMS88 Cellular Mobile Telephone System, ERICSSON document EN/LZT 101908 R2, 1988, whereas the GSM-system is described in CME 20 SYSTEM, ERICSSON document EN/LZT 120226 R2A, 1991. These mobile telephone systems use mobile services switching centres (MSC) , each of which is connected to a 

 number of radio base stations (BS) which maintain radio contact with mobile subscribers (MS) which roam within radio coverage areas. These mobile services switching centres have means (VLR, GLR) for keeping an account of which subscribers are located within the service range of respective switching centres. In the system described in the following, the means (VLR, GLR) is physically integratedwith the switching centre, which is accordingly referenced MSC/VLR or MSC/GLR. At least one home location register (HLR) is provided for the whole network, this register keeping an account of all data relating to those subscribers which belong to the network. The network is reached through a special gatewaymobile services switching centre GMSC, which translates an incoming call to the address register of the called

CLAIMS
1. A method for restructuring a standardized call signal frame (IAM) arriving at a mobile telephone system, said frame including a first parameter field (Called Party Address) having a directory number (MSN) for a subscriber roaming in the mobile telephone system, and a secondparameter field (End Information Transfer) into which optional information can be inserted, characterized by replacing the directory number (MSN) in the firstparameter field (Called Party Address) with a unique routing number (PRN) to a mobile telephone services switching centre in whose service area the mobile subscriber roams; and by placing a subscriber unique identification number (IMSI) and directory number (MSN) in the optional information space of the second parameter field (End Infor- mation Transfer) .
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized by collecting the unique routing number (PRN) and the unique identification number (IMSI) of the called subscriber from the data records of the subscriber in a home location register (HLR-1) with the subscriber's directory number as a pointer.
3. A method according to Claim 2, characterized by placing the unique routing number (PRN) in the records of a subscriber in the home location register (HLR-1) in a registering operation in which the unique identification number (IMSI) of the subscriber is used as a pointer.
4. A method of transferring from a gateway mobile switching centre (GMSC) in a first mobile telephone network (NWl) call information (IAM) relating to a mobile subscriber (MS) which roams in a second mobile telephone network and which has home registration in the first mobile telephone network (NWl) , to a mobile switching centre (MSC/GLR-2) within whose service area the mobile telephone is located, characterized by 


extracting from a signal message incoming to the gateway mobile switching centre (GMSC) a subscriber's directory number (MSN) relating to the calledmobile subscriber (MS) and using the extracted directory number as a pointer to collect from data records allocated to said subscriber (MS) in a home location register (HLR-1) in the first network (NWl) a first unique routing number (PRN) to saidmobile telephone switching centre and a unique subscriber identification number (IMSI) to the gateway mobile switching centre (GMSC) in which said unique routing number (PRN) , said unique identification number (IMSI) and said subscriber directory number (MSN) are compiled to form a new call message (IAM) which is sent to the mobile telephone switching centre (MSC/GLR) pointed-out by the routing number (PRN) and in whose register section (GLR) all other parameters for setting up a connection to the mobile subscriber (MS) are collected while using the unique iden¬ tification number (IMSI) as a pointer.
