<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a reaction injection 
molding process for preparing a molded product by reaction of a 

mixture of 

(a) an organic polyisocyanate; 
(b) one or more compounds containing at least two isocyanate-reactive 
groups; 
(c) about 0.5 to about 40% by weight, based on the weight of the 
molded product, of rigid microspheres, preferably in admixture 

with component (b); 
 
and, optionally, 


(d) an inert gas dissolved in at least one of components (a) or (b) in 
an amount sufficient to produce a molded product having a 

density that is at least 1% less than the density of an analogous 
molded product without an inert gas but which is at least 0.75 

g/cm³; and 
(e) up to 45% by weight, based upon the weight of the molded 
product, of a reinforcing filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a Continuation-In-Part of Application 
Serial No. 08/107,389, filed August 16, 1993. A variety of different molded polyurethane parts can be 
produced by the reaction injection molding ("RIM") process. This 
process involves filling a closed mold with highly reactive liquid 
starting components within a very short time, generally by using high 
output, high pressure dosing apparatus after the components have 
been mixed. The RIM process has become an important process for 
the production of external automotive body parts and other types of 
molded products. The RIM process involves the intimate mixing of a 
polyisocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component, 
followed by the injection of this mixture into a mold for subsequent 
rapid curing. The polyisocyanate component is typically based on a 
liquid polyisocyanate. The isocyanate-reactive component contains a 
high molecular weight isocyanate-reactive component, typically a 
polyol and/or an amine polyether, and usually contains a chain 
extender containing amino and/or hydroxyl groups. U.S. Patent 
4,218,543 describes a RIM process currently being commercially used 
on a large scale. U.S. Patents 4,433,067, 4,444,910, 4,530,941, 
4,774,263, and 4,774,264 describe reaction injection molding 
processes for the production of polyurethane(urea) elastomers. As 
used herein, the term "polyurethanes" includes polyurethanes, 
polyureas, and polyurethane polyureas.  Expanded microspheres consisting of a synthetic 
thermoplastic resin shell that encapsulates a liquid blowing agent are 
known. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 4,829,094, 4,843,104, and 4,902,722. 
Such microspheres have been suggested for use in plastics, coatings, 
and adhesives, and are described as having the ability to reduce 
density, to lower volume costs, to improve impact resistance, and to 
reduce shrinkage (see "Dualite" product information bulletin). In 
addition, such microspheres have been described as useful in low 
density rapid setting polyurethanes (see U. S. Patent 4,038,238) and 
in non-polyurethane-based reaction injection molded polymers (see, 
e.g., U.S. Patent 4,959,395). Finally, unexpanded microspheres have 
been described for use in polyurethane RIM. See Japanese Patent 
Publication 60-244511. The known uses of microspheres, however, are still 
attended by various disadvantages, such as poor mold release. 
Therefore, it was an object to the present invention to prepare readily 
released urethane addition products by the RIM process using
