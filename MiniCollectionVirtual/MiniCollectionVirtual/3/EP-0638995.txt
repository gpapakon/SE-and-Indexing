<ABSTRACT>
A DC coupled amplifier (207) fed by an RF detector (205) has 
greater dynamic range capabilities than techniques in the prior art. 

An illustrative embodiment of the present invention advantageously 
comprises a low-offset voltage, low-offset current differential 

amplifier (207) fed by an RF detector (205) having a fifth lead 
(223) from the reference voltage node (231) within the RF detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for detecting a signal.As shown in FIG.1, RF detector 105 feeds single-ended amplifier 107 a
DC coupled video signal. Depending upon the mechanical construction of the
apparatus comprising RF detector 105 and single-ended amplifier 109, the return
current from RF detector 105 can take several paths. Bulkhead grounding through
coaxial connectors usually takes most of the current, but some always flows through
the sneak paths, represented by ground resistors 151, causing a voltage error at the
reference ground lead 121. This voltage, while perhaps only a millivolt, can easily
drown the signal voltage in applications that require a wide dynamic range. The
result is that part of the voltage error propagates through RF detector 107 and is
superimposed on top of the signal on lead 125.US-A-4791380 discloses a detector circuit for radio-frequency signals
that is formed of a pair of matched diodes disposed on a common substrate which is
heated by a temperature responsive feedback circuit to stabilize the temperature of
the substrate and the diodes. A capacitor is connected to one or both of the diodes to
form a detector of the detector circuit. A bias circuit provides equal bias currents to
the two diodes, and an amplifier is connected to the two diodes to extract voltages
associated with the bias currents, and to subtract these voltages in a differential
manner so as to exclude the effect of bias voltage from an output signal of the
amplifier. The amplifier is also coupled to an output terminal of the detector to
isolate the detector from subsequent stages of signal processing, as well as to
amplify detected signals. The diodes are each, preferably, Schottky diodes for
improved dynamic range of signal detection. This detector circuit suffers from the
voltage errors at a reference ground lead due to current flowing through parasitic
resistances of sneak paths.US-A-4689576 discloses an apparatus and method for linearizing a
non-linear device. This apparatus consists of a detecting device for detecting a
signal when received, a feedback device for providing a feedback signal, an
operational amplifier, and a bias means. These devices are coupled to provide an
output that is linearly dependent upon the input to the circuit and not upon the
amplitude of the signal received.According to this invention there is provided apparatus as claimed in
claim 1.The present invention provides a mechanism for detecting a DC coupled
RF signal while avoiding many of the costs and restrictions
