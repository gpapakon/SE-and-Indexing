<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oscillator circuits suitable for inclusion in
integrated circuits. In particular the invention is concerned with oscillator circuits for
providing stable sine-wave outputs.Oscillator circuits are known, for example from United States Patent
US 3983512, in which the resonant or frequency selective circuits are constructed
utilising capacitors and cross-coupled transistor pairs, the frequency of oscillation or
resonance being dependent upon the emitter resistances of the transistors, which may
be controlled by controlling their d.c. emitter currents. In the arrangements disclosed
in this U.S. Patent, however, a separate amplifier is required to provide the gain to
sustain oscillations.According to the present invention a stable sine-wave oscillator circuit
comprises a first bipolar transistor having its emitter electrode connected to one terminal
of a current source and its collector electrode connected to the emitter electrode of a
second bipolar transistor the collector electrode of which is connected to a first supply
voltage conductor by way of first load means, a third bipolar transistor having its
emitter electrode connected to said one terminal of said current source and its collector
electrode connected to the emitter electrode of a fourth bipolar transistor the collector
electrode of which is connected to said first supply voltage conductor by way of second
load means, the other terminal of said current source being connected to a second supply
voltage conductor, a first capacitor connected between the collector electrodes of said
second and fourth transistors and a second capacitor connected between the collector 
electrodes of said first and third transistors, the base and collector electrodes of said
second and fourth transistors being cross-connected and the base and collector
electrodes of the first and third transistors being cross-connected.The first and second load means may comprise respective load resistors or
respective diodes, or may comprise emitter/collector paths of further bipolar transistors
in series with respective load resistors, the base electrodes of said further transistors
being connected to said first supply voltage conductor.Oscillator circuits in accordance with the present invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:-Figures 1 to 3 show diagrammatically respective different embodiments of
the invention. Referring first to Figure 1 the basic oscillator circuit in accordance with the
present
