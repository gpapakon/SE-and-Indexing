<ABSTRACT>
Thin semiconductor devices, such as thin solar cells (10), 
and a method of fabricating same are disclosed. A microblasting 

procedure is employed to thin a semiconductor wafer or substrate 
(11), such as a solar cell wafer. Fine abrasive particles are 

used to etch away wafer material through a mask. Thick areas 
remain at the perimeter of the semiconductor device or solar 

cell (10), in regions of the semiconductor device or solar cell 
(10) behind front interconnect attachement pads, and at 

corresponding rear interconnecting attachment areas (14). In 
addition, there are thick areas in a pattern that comprise 

interconnected beams (18) that support the thin wafer areas. 
Consequently, predetermined areas of the substrate (11) are 

thinned to form a predetermined structural pattern in the 
substrate (11) that includes an external frame (17) and a 

plurality of interconnected beams (18). The final configuration 
of the semiconductor device or solar cell (10) has approximately 

20 % of the area of the original wafer thickness with the 
remaining 80 % etched away to a relatively thin thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductors and fabrication 
methods, and more particularly, to thin solar cell structures and a method of fabricating 
same. The current technology for producing thin solar cells utilizes wet chemical 
etching to reduce the thickness of solar cell wafers (Si, III-V and II-VI) from about 
0.007 inches thick down to approximately 0.0025 to 0.0035 inches thick. However, 
preferential chemical etching can open up lineages (line defects) in the wafer that leads 
to wafer breakage. Also, after the planar etching process, there is high attrition during 
subsequent cell manufacturing process steps and later during circuit assembly and panel 
bonding processes. It is also very difficult to attach silver interconnects to thin solar 
cells made by chemical etching procedures by welding processes, and almost impossible 
to weld Kovar or molybdenum interconnects thereto due to the high pressure 
required. Welded Kovar interconnects are known industry-wide to have high fatigue 
resistance for long term and extreme environment missions, and are therefore a 
preferred interconnect structure. Satellite solar panel designers are continually striving to design high efficiency 
panels having low mass because of expensive satellite launch costs. Current satellite 
design goals place a premium on high power, and consequently there is a push for high 
efficiency solar panel technology. This makes GaAs and other III-V or II-VI type solar 
cells an attractive alternative to traditional Si solar cells. High efficiency solar cell  
 
substrates such as GaAs or Ge unfortunately have more than twice the mass penalty as 
Si-based solar cells and therefore must be substantially thinned to surpass the power 
per weight value of Si. This thinning results in high efficiency solar cells that are 
extremely fragile not only during cell and panel fabrication, but also throughout their 
life in the stressful space environment. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide for thin solar 
cell structures and a method of fabricating them that overcomes the limitations of 
conventional thin solar cells. In order to meet the above objectives, the present invention provides for thin 
semiconductor devices, and solar cells in particular, and a method of fabricating same. 
In general, the semiconductor device comprises a substrate, and a predetermined 
number of semiconductor layers are disposed on a front surface of the substrate. Front
