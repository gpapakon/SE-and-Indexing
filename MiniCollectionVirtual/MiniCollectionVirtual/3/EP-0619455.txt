<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressurized internal
circulating fluidized-bed boiler, and more particularly to a
pressurized internal circulating fluidized-bed boiler for use
in a pressurized fluidized-bed combined-cycle electric
generating system in which a fuel such as coal, petro coke, or
the like is combusted in a pressurized fluidized bed and an
exhaust gas produced by the combusted fuel is introduced into
a gas turbine.Efforts to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide from
various sources are important in view of environmental damages
that are being caused by air pollution which appears to be more
and more serious on the earth. It is conjectured that coal
will have to be relied upon as a major energy resource because
greater dependency on nuclear and oil energies is not favorable
at present. To suppress carbon dioxide emission and provide a
substitute for oil and nuclear power, there has been a demand
for a highly efficient, compact electric generating system
which is capable of utilizing coal combustion to generate a
clean energy.To meet such a demand, atmospheric fluidized-bed boilers
(AFBC) capable of burning coals of different kinds for electric
generation have been developed because a stable energy supply
cannot be achieved by pulverized coal boilers which pose a 
limitation on available coal types.However, the atmospheric fluidized-bed boilers (AFBC) fail
to perform the functions that have been expected. In addition,
since only steam turbines can be combined with the atmospheric
fluidized-bed boilers, there are certain limitations on
attempts to increase the efficiency and energy output of the
atmospheric fluidized-bed boilers. These disadvantages of the
atmospheric fluidized-bed boilers have directed research and
development trends toward pressurized fluidized-bed boilers
(PFBC) that make it possible to construct combined-cycle
electric generating systems with gas turbines.Further, there has been researched a coal gasification
combined-cycle electric generating system in which coal is
converted into gas and a refined gas purified by removing dust
particles is supplied to a gas turbine. The coal gasification
combined-cycle electric generating system, incorporating an
air-cooled gas turbine which uses exhaust gas of 1300Â°C, has a
target efficiency of 47.1% at a generating end.On the other hand, the pressurized bubbling type
fluidized-bed boilers with a capacity over 80 MWe are already
in operation overseas as demonstration or commercial models
and, in addition, has an advantage that a
