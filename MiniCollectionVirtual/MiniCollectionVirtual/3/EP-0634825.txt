<ABSTRACT>
A graphical representation (45) of the current/time trip characteristic displayed 
on the operator's panel (43) of an electronic trip unit for a circuit interrupter, has 

different indicia (83, 85), such as different colors, identifying the representation (73) 
of independent trip functions from those (79, 81) of dependent trip functions, thereby 

making the operator aware that adjustment of one of the dependent trip functions will 
also affect and adjustment of the other dependent portions of the current/time trip 

characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to overcurrent trip units for electric circuit interrupting
devices, and more particularly to trip units which provide multiple protection
functions having a dependency relationship between selectable trip parameters, and
which have a graphical representation of the current/time trip characteristic of the
device displayed on an operator's panel.Circuit interrupters for industrial and commercial applications commonly
provide multiple protection functions. For instance, such circuit interrupters typically
provide instantaneous and long delay protection and may also provide short delay
protection and/or ground fault protection. The instantaneous trip function protects the
electrical conductors to which the current interrupting device is connected from
damaging overcurrent conditions, such as short circuits. The long delay trip function
protects the load served by the protected electrical system from overcurrents. The
short delay trip function can be used to coordinate tripping of down stream circuit
interrupters in a hierarchy of circuit interrupters. As implied, the ground fault trip
function protects the electrical system from faults to ground.
Each circuit interrupter is designed for a specific maximum continuous current. This
current rating may be set by selection of a resistor which converts the current to a
voltage for use by the trip unit. In some cases, a single circuit interrupter from may
be easily adapted for installations which call for a range of maximum continuous 
currents, up to the design limits of the frame, through use of a removable rating plug
by which the current rating of the device can be established. Traditionally, the pick-up
currents for the various protection functions have been selectable multiples or
fractions of this current rating. Thus, instantaneous protection trips the device
anytime the current reaches a selected multiple of the rated current, such as for
example, ten times the rated current. Pick-up for short delay protection is a lesser
multiple of the rated current, while pick-up current for long delay protection may be a
fraction of the rated current.The long delay and short delay trip functions require that the overcurrent
conditions exist for a period of time. Typically, the long delay trip function has
been selected such that a trip signal is generated if the current exceeds six times the
rated current for the selected long delay interval. As damage can also occur at lesser
current levels for longer periods of time, an inverse time function
