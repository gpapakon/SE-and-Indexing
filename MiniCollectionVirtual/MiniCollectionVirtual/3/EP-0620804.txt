<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluoride ion-leachable glasses and to water- or resin-based
dental cement compositions containing such glasses.Aqueous poly (carboxylic acid) cement compositions are well known and have
been routinely used in dentistry. Such compositions are commonly referred to
as glass ionomer cements, and basically comprise (i) a polymer containing free
carboxylic acid groups (typically a homo-or co-polymer of acrylic acid) and (ii)
an ion-leachable glass such as calcium aluminofluorosilicate glass. In the
presence of water, the glass leaches polyvalent metal ions such as aluminum
and calcium ions and these serve to cross-link the polymer to give a rigid
gelatinous structure. At the same time, silica material in the glass reacts with
water to produce silicic acid. As a result of these gel-forming reactions, a
cement, suitable for dental use, forms.A problem with glass ionomer cements in the prior art is that they are
radiolucent and thus provide no contrast on x-rays between the cement and
surrounding tooth structure. In order to address this issue, it has been
proposed to replace calcium in a calcium aluminofluorosilicate glass with
strontium and, thereby, produce a glass which may be radiopaque, and still
have acceptable properties with regard to strength, hardness, translucency,
etc. (U.S. 4,814,362). The use of barium glass or barium sulphate to confer
radiopacity on a glass ionomer has also been described (PCT application No.
88,105,651).Calcium aluminofluorosilicate glass used in the glass ionomer cements contain
large quantities of fluoride. Although fluoride lowers the firing temperatures 
of the glasses, it is also released in a cement composition where calcium
aluminofluoro silicate is incorporated. Fluoride, if released in sufficient
quantity, imparts cariostatic properties to the cements when used in the repair
of carious lesions. However, while calcium aluminofluorosilicate glass is
acceptable in terms of fluoride release, it is not desirable in dental use
because of its visual opacity and limited radiopacity.Thus, the requirement of adequate radiopacity and sustained fluoride release
makes the development of new glasses desirable. Dental cement
compositions containing such glasses should meet such other desirable
criteria as: (a) translucency; (b) long shelf life; (c) low solubility in oral fluids;
(d) strong adhesion to the tooth; (e) suitable working and setting times; and
(f) adequate strength. The present invention provides fluoride ion-leachable
glasses and dental cement
