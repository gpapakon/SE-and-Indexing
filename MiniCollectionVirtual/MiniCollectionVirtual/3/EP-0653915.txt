A steam appliance for treating and/or shaping hair, the appliance
comprising:


a housing (1) having grasping means;
a roller body (2) for rolling up locks of hair, the body being
secured at one end (5a) to the housing and being limited towards its

other end by a partition wall (5b), said body including holes (4b) to
pass steam from a steam production member;
clamping means (10) for clamping a lock of hair on the roller
body (2); and
steam delivery means connected to said steam production means
and opening out into the roller body (2), said delivery means being a

tubular element (20) mounted coaxially inside and extending along the
roller body (2) from an inlet (20a) situated in the housing, said

element (20) including at least one steam outlet orifice (21),

the appliance being characterized in that said orifice (21) is
situated at the terminal end of said tube in such a manner as to

convey an inlet flow of steam inside the tubular element (20)
substantially along its entire length to be released in the vicinity

of the partitioning wall (5b) via the orifice (21) and then to be
directed in the opposite direction inside the roller body (2) along

the longitudinal recesses (26) between the outside surface of said
tubular element (20) and the inside surface of said roller body (2)

to enable it then to escape through said holes (4b).
An appliance according to claim 1, characterized in that the
terminal end of the tubular element (20) is provided with a steam

dispensing orifice (21) which opens out into a manifold chamber (25)
provided between said end and the terminal inside face (5c) of the

internal wall (5b).
An appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
outside surface of the tubular element (20) and the inside surface of

the roller body (2) co-operate to define a series of longitudinal
recesses (26) forming steam flow distributing channels extending from

the orifice (21). 
An appliance according to claim 3, characterized in that the
recesses (26) extend from the terminal end of the tubular element

(20).
An appliance according to claims 3 and 4, characterized in that
the internal section of the roller body (2) is circular.
An appliance according to claim 5, characterized in that the
tubular element (20) is formed by a deformed tube having at least

three branches (27), the branches supporting the roller body (2)
along at least three generator lines, the recesses (26) being defined

between pairs of adjacent branches (27).
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the roller body (2) is provided on the outside with

longitudinal ribs (4) that define between them grooves (4a) having
the holes (4b) formed therein.
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the roller body (2) is mounted to rotate freely on the

housing about its longitudinal axis and about the tubular element
(20).
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that it includes a fan unit suitable for creating a stream of air

running in the opposite direction to the direction in which the flow
of steam moves along the recesses (26).
An appliance according to claim 9, characterized in that the
stream of air flows along the recesses (26) from the housing and

towards the terminal end of the tubular element (20) so as to perform
air/steam mixing in said recesses.
An appliance according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that
the stream of air includes a peripheral annular ventilation section

surrounding the roller body (2) and passing through a perforated ring 
(30) that links together the roller body (2) and the inside of the

housing.
A method of treating and/or shaping hair, and consisting in:

holding a lock of hair in place between a roller body and means
for clamping the lock on said body;
rolling up the held lock on the roller body; and
causing steam to pass from the roller body through the held
lock;

characterized in that it further consists in:
conveying the inlet flow of steam without loss to the
surroundings towards the end of the roller body and along its

longitudinal axis within a coaxial tubular element extending inside
the roller body; and
releasing the flow of steam in the vicinity of the end of the
roller body and directing it between the outside surface of the

tubular element and the inside surface of said roller body in the
direction opposite to the direction of the inlet flow to enable it

then to escape through the holes provided through the periphery of
said roller body.
A method according to claim 12, characterized in that it consists
in producing a flow of air against the released flow of steam so as

to ensure air/steam mixing of the two flows immediately before the
mixture penetrates into the lock.
