<ABSTRACT>
A pair of tubular joint members (31,32) each have 
a gasket holding annular protuberance (33,34) on an abutting 

end face thereof. The protuberance has an inner 
peripheral surface continuous with the inner peripheral 

surface of the joint member, and a sealing face adapted 
to intimately contact an end face of of a gasket (20) at a 

position radially outward from the inner peripheral 
surface thereof. The sealing face is most protuberant 

at a position radially outward from an inner edge 
thereof. When the most protuberant end of the sealing 

face comes into contact with the gasket end face, a 
clearance is formed between the portion of the sealing 

face radially inward from the protuberant end and the 
radially inward portion of the gasket end face. The 

clearance is eliminated by the deformation of the 
gasket when the pipe joint is tightened up.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pipe joints are already known which comprise
a pair of tubular joint members each having a gasket
holding annular protuberance on an abutting end face
thereof, an annular gasket interposed between the
abutting end faces of the respective joint members and
a nut for joining the joint members together. The
joint members, annular protuberances and gasket are
equal in inside diameter, and each annular protuberance
is adapted to contact the inner edge portion of
the gasket over the entire circumference thereof.An example of a pipe joint according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-5 222 747.With reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 showing the
conventional pipe joint, indicated at 42 is the joint
member, at 44 the gasket holding annular protuberance
and at 45 the annular gasket.With the conventional pipe joint described,
each annular protuberance 44 is adapted to come into
contact with the inner peripheral edge portion of the
gasket 45 over the entire circumference thereof to make
the protuberance 44 flush with the gasket 45 when the
nut has been tightened up and to eliminate any liquid
trapping recess from the pipe joint. In the case of the conventional pipe joint
described, the force acting on the gasket holding
annular protuberance 44 when the nut is tightened has
not only an axial (i.e., rightward in FIG. 6) component
but also an inward (downward in FIG. 6) component as
seen in FIG. 6, so that the protuberance 44 deforms
inward. On the other hand, the gasket 45 deforms most
markedly at the inner edge portion thereof with which
each protuberance 44 comes into contact first.
Consequently, there arises the problem that the protuberance
44 and the inner edge portion of the gasket
44 become separated, forming a liquid trapping annular
recess S between the protuberance 44 and the gasket 45
when the pipe joint is tightened up as shown in FIG. 7.An object of the present invention is to
eliminate a recess due to the deformation of the gasket
and gasket holding annular protuberance and to provide
a pipe joint wherein no liquid trapping recess is
present when the joint is tightened up.The present invention provides a 
pipe joint comprising a pair of tubular joint members
each having a gasket holding annular
protuberance on an abutting end face thereof, an
annular gasket interposed between the abutting end
faces of the respective joint members and
threaded means for joining the joint members
together, the annular protuberance having an
inner peripheral surface continuous with the
inner peripheral surface of the

<CLAIMS>
A pipe joint comprising a pair of tubular joint members
(31, 32) each having a gasket holding annular

protuberance (33, 34) on an abutting end face thereof, an
annular gasket (20) interposed between the abutting end

faces of the respective joint members (31, 32) and
threaded means for joining the joint members (31, 32)

together, the annular protuberance (33, 34) having an
inner peripheral surface (33a, 34a) continuous with the

inner peripheral surface of the joint member (31, 32) and
a sealing face (33b, 34b) adapted to intimately contact

an end face of the gasket (20) at a position radially
outward from the inner peripheral surface (33a, 34a)

thereof, 
characterized in that
 the sealing face (33b,
34b) is most protuberant in the axial direction at a

position radially outward from an inner edge thereof,
that the sealing face (33b, 34b) comes into contact with

the end face of the gasket (20) at its axially most
protuberant end (P) first and that then a clearance (G1)

is formed between the portion of the sealing face (33b,
34b) radially inward from the axially most protuberant

end (P) and the radially inward portion of the gasket end
face, the gasket (20) being deformable to eliminate the

clearance (G1) when the pipe joint is tightened up so that the
inner peripheral surface of the annular protuberance is continuous with each

inner peripheral surface of the joint member.
A pipe joint as defined in claim 1, wherein the sealing
face (33a, 34a) has a circular-arc cross section larger

than a quarter of the corresponding circle, and the
circular arc has a center (O) having a

diameter ending at a position radially outward from the inner peripheral surface of the joint
member (31, 32). 
A pipe joint as defined in claim 2, wherein the circular
arc has a diameter of 0.8 to 1.2 mm and the position

of the center (O) of the circular
arc radially outward from the inner peripheral surface

is at 30 to 60 % of the diameter of the circular arc radially outward from the inner
peripheral surface of the joint member (31,32).
