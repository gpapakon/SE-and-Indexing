<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spacers for flat panel displays 
such as field emission displays. US Patent 4,857,799 describes an example of a conventional colour 
field emission display. Such displays typically comprise a 
cathodoluminescent screen overlying and spaced from a two dimensional 
matrix of field emission cathodes. US Patents 3,789,471, 3,665,241, and 
3,775,704 describe examples of, and methods of producing such cathodes. 
Each cathode comprises three arrays of field emissive tips. Each array 
covers a surface area of typically 300X300 microns. The arrays each 
comprise substantially the same number of tips (typically 1000). The 
screen is divided into a plurality of pixels . Each pixel is divided into 
three sub-pixels. Each sub-pixel is formed by a phosphor corresponding to 
a different one of the three primary colours, Red, Green and Blue. Each 
array of a cathode faces a different sub-pixel of a corresponding pixel. 
The arrays are individually addressable via row and column conductors. In operation, voltages determined by red, green and blue input 
video signals are sequentially applied to the row and column conductors 
to address each cathode in turn in a raster fashion. The voltages 
interact to generate a localised high electric field at each tip. The 
localised electric fields cause electrons to be emitted from the tips by 
a tunnelling mechanism. The electrons are collectively accelerated 
towards the phosphors by an electric field generated between the screen 
and the cathode matrix. The phosphors are excited by incident electrons 
to display an image as a function of the input video signals. In some conventional field emission displays, the screen is spaced 
from the cathodes by ball spacers of 200 micron diameter. The spacers are 
formed from a dielectric material. The dielectric material can be a 
plastics material such as polypropylene or an inorganic material such as 
glass. An organic adhesive secures the spacers in place. However, such 
adhesives tend to volatilise in evacuated environments such as the 
interior of the display. The volatilised adhesive contaminates the 
otherwise clean interior of the display. This can degrade the performance  
 
of the display. Furthermore, each spacer obscures a substantial portion 
of the underlying cathode. In other conventional field emission displays, the screen is spaced 
from the cathodes by an array of pillars etched from a deposited film of 
polyimide of a thickness in the range 100 to 200 microns. The pillars 
permit displays
