<ABSTRACT>
Process for the separation of sulphate ions from brine solutions, including the stages of (i) bringing the brine into contact with a zircon-bearing compound, (ii) separation into a solution depleted in sulphates and into a zircon-bearing compound onto which the sulphate ions are absorbed; (iii) desorption of the sulphates by treatment of the zircon-bearing compound obtained in stage (ii) at a basic pH; (iv) separation into a basic aqueous solution enriched in sulphates and into a zircon-bearing compound substantially free from sulphate ions; characterised in that the zircon-bearing compound is hydrated zirconium hydroxide which is in the form of an undried gelatinous precipitate. The invention also relates to the gelatinous precipitate.

Process for the separation of sulphate ions from 
brine solutions, including the stages of: 


(i) bringing the brine solution into contact with a 
zirconium-bearing compound, at an acidic pH; 
(ii) separation into a brine solution depleted in sulphate 
ions and the zirconium-bearing compound on 

which the sulphate ions are adsorbed; 
(iii) desorption of the sulphate ions by treatment of 
the zirconium-bearing compound obtained in stage 

(ii) at a basic pH; 
(iv) separation into a basic aqueous solution enriched 
in sulphate ions and a zirconium-bearing compound 

substantially free from sulphate ions,
 
characterized in that the zirconium-bearing compound is 

hydrated zirconium hydroxide of formula Zr(OH)
