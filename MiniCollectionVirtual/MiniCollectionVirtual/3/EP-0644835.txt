<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a removable security device (100) which in a preferred embodiment is inserted into an existing cigar/cigarette lighter socket of a vehicle and acts as an anti-theft system. The security device (100) transmits an authorisation code through the electrical network of the vehicle. The code is detected by enabling devices (200) which are connected in series with components (300) of the vehicle, e.g. the starter motor and/or fuel pump. When the or each enabling device (200) receives a bona fide authorisation code it switches on thereby allowing the component to be operated. As the enabling devices (200) are small they can be fitted into components at manufacture or fitted to existing components. The system has a very low power requirement and therefore does not need cooling. It has safety features which ensure that if the vehicle stalls the components are not disabled. An advantage of the invention is that no major modifications need to be made to a vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SECURITY ENABLING AND SWITCHING DEVICESThis invention relates in general to security enabling and switching devices for a vehicle having an electrical power supply system. The invention also relates to the enabling and switching devices when used in combination, to a vehicle when fitted with such devices, and to a vehicle component incorporating the switching device. The invention relates more particularly to security devices of the "immobilisation" type where the enabling device is an electronic "key" bearing an authorisation code and the switching device switches on a vital component of the vehicle (say, the fuel pump (or fuel injection system) or starter motor solenoid) only when activated by a key bearing the correct authorisation code. It is already known from Australian Patent Application No. 58047/90 to provide a security device to prevent unauthorised usage of a vehicle. The security device comprises an electronic key in which is stored an authorisation code, a decoder for receiving the code upon electronic connection of the key, and an electronic switch to enable operation of a component of the vehicle when the key supplies a valid code to the decoder. Dedicated wiring is provided to transmit the decoded signal from the decoder to the switch when the key is directly electrically connected to the decoder. This arrangement suffers from several disadvantages associated with the use of this dedicated wiring link. Most importantly, a thief can determine the location of the switch by tracing the wiring from the decoder to the switch. Once located, the switch can be overridden and the vehicle can be stolen. Also, fitting of the wiring can be time-consuming and expensive.Another vehicle disabling device is described in US Patent 4 463 340 (ADKINS). This device has a permanently connected keyboard. Data from the keyboard is transmitted to a receiver or switch, using a pulse width modulation (PWM) technique. This system of data transmission was found to be acceptable for words 

 having a low number of bits in their length. However, as word lengths became longer, in order to enhance security, because clock rates at the key (encoder) and receiver (decoder) may differ synchronisation can become difficult. This could lead to corruption of data and/or non recognition, by the decoder, of a valid authorisation signal.International Patent Application WO-A-8103002 (BLAIS AUTOSECURITY CORP) describes a coded engine starter system. A modulated carrier signal transmits data to a decoder which decodes the signal

CLAIMS
1. A removable security device for a vehicle, having means for receiving a power supply and means for modifying a characteristic of the supply so as to impart an identification signal to said power supply, a characteristic of which signal is received and read to verify a user's authority and which on verification enables the vehicle to be driven.
2. A removable security device for a vehicle having an electrical power supply system, comprising means for selectively superimposing a security signal on the power supply system, characterised in that the security device is adapted to be inserted into a vehicle's cigar/cigarette lighter socket.
3. A device according to Claim 1 or 2 further including connector means for releasably connecting the device directly to the supply system.
4. A device according to any of the preceding claims wherein the security signal takes the form of a carrier signal which is frequency moduj-ated by an authorisation code.
5. A device according to any of the preceding claims including means for providing a perceptible signal in dependence on whether the device is connected to the supply system.
6. A security switching device for a vehicle having an electrical power supply system, comprising a switch arrangement for selectively providing power from the power supply system to a vehicle component, means for receiving a security signal superimposed on the supply system and means for actuating the switch arrangement in dependence on whether the security signal is valid.
7. A device according to Claim 6 further comprising means for refusing further security signals if an invalid security signal is received.
8. A device according to Claim 7 wherein the security signal is repetitive and the refusing means is arranged to refuse further security signals if a plurality of repetitions of an invalid 


 security signal is detected.
9. A device according to Claim 7 or 8 wherein the refusing means is arranged to refuse further security signals if a valid security signal is not received within a predetermined interval from when power is first supplied to the device.
10. A device according to any of Claims 6 to 9 further comprising means for latching the switch arrangement once actuated by a valid security signal .
11. A device according to any of Claims 6 to 10 having only two external electrical terminals.
12. A device according to any of Claims 6 to 11 having a high input impedance.
13. A combination comprising a security enabling device according to any of Claims 1 to 5 and a security switching device according to any of Claims 6 to 12.
14. A combination according to Claim 13 wherein a plurality of security switching devices is provided.
15. A combination according to Claim 13 or 14 wherein the enabling device includes a clock for timing encoding of the security signal and the switching device includes a clock for timing the decoding of the signal, and means is provided to synchronise the two clocks.
16. A vehicle when fitted with apparatus according to any of the preceding claims. 17. A vehicle when fitted with a device according to any of Claims 6 to 12 wherein the device is arranged to operate only when the vehicle operation switch (such as the ignition switch) is switched on. 18. A vehicle component including a device according to any of Claims 6 to 12 fitted within the housing of the component.
