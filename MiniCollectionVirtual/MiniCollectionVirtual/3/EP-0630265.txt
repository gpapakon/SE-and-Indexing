<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiodiagnostic agents and reagents for
preparing such agents, and also methods for producing radiolabeled
radiodiagnostic agents. Specifically, the invention relates to technetium-99m
(Tc-99m) labeled agents, methods and kits for making such agents, and
use of such agents to image sites of infection and inflammation in
a mammalian body.A variety of radionuclides are known to be useful for radioimaging,
including 67Ga, 99mTc (Tc-99m), 111In, 123I, 125I, 169Yb or 186Re. The sensitivity
of imaging methods using radioactively-labeled peptides is much higher than
other techniques known in the art, since the specific binding of the radioactive
peptide concentrates the radioactive signal over the area of interest, for
example, an inflammatory site.There is a clinical need to be able to determine the location and/or
extent of sites of focal or localized infection. In a substantial number of cases
conventional methods of diagnosis (such as physical examination, x-ray, CT
and ultrasonography) fail to identify such sites (e.g., an abscess). In some
cases, biopsy may be resorted to, but is preferably avoided at least until it is
necessary in order to identify the pathogen responsible for an abscess at a
known location. Identifying the site of such "occult" infection is important
because rapid localization of the problem is critical to effective therapeutic
intervention.In the field of nuclear medicine, certain pathological conditions can be
localized or the extent of such conditions determined by imaging the internal
distribution of administered radioactively-labeled tracer compounds (i.e.
radiotracers or radiopharmaceuticals) that accumulate specifically at the 
pathological site. However, an abscess may be caused by any one of many
possible pathogens, so that a radiotracer specific for a particular pathogen
would have limited scope. On the other hand, infection is almost invariably
accompanied by inflammation, which is a general response of the body to
tissue injury. Therefore, a radiotracer specific for sites of inflammation would
be expected to be useful in localizing sites of infection caused by any
pathogen.One of the main phenomena associated with inflammation is the
localization of leukocytes (white blood cells), usually monocytes and
neutrophils, at the site of inflammation. A radiotracer specific for leukocytes
would be useful in detecting leukocytes at the site of a localized infection.
Currently approved nuclear medicine procedures for imaging sites of infection
