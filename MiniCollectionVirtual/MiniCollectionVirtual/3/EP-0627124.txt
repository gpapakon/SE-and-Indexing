<DESCRIPTION>
 FET CHIP WITH HEAT-EXTRACTING BRIDGEFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a semiconductor having field effect transistors thereon with a bridge joining the sources of adjacent transistors being substantial with the bridge mounted against a heat- extracting surface so that heat from the transistor is extracted at the source.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coplanar field effect transistors (FET) and particularly gallium arsenide semiconductor FETs are conventionally equipped with a plated air bridge which joins the sources of adjacent FETs. The semiconductor chip is mounted on a support base, and heat is extracted from the FET junctions down through the semiconductor chip and the support base. The semiconductor chip material is a poor heat conductor and, as a consequence, the transistors are heat-limited. The air bridges from source to source are not structurally sufficient to remove significant heat and are used only to ground the sources. With the poor heat conductivity of the semicon¬ ductor chip material, especially gallium arsenide, the chip material is sometimes ground down, thinner than possible with slicing, in order to reduce the thermal path. However, such thin chips are more subject to cracking from external forces. Turning the chip over with the coplanar FET structures toward the supporting 

 substrate is known and is described in an IEEE paper "A Flip-Chip Gallium Arsenide FET with Gate and Drain Via Connections," by R. L. Camisa, etal, IEEE Electron Device Letters, Volume EDL-5, No. 4, April 1984. However, the structure in that paper does not lend itself to improved removal of heat to facilitate high power FET devices, particularly fabricated with gallium arsenide.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn order to aid in the understanding of this invention, it can be stated in essentially summary form that it is directed to a FET chip with a heat-extracting bridge with the bridge being made of metal to provide electrical connections and heat extraction. The bridge is mounted against the substrate, which provides physical support and thermal extraction.It is thus a purpose and advantage of this invention to provide a FET chip which has a substantial heat-extracting bridge mounted from source to source with a heat-extracting device mounted against the bridge to extract heat directly from the surface of the chip at its transistor source.It is another purpose and advantage of this invention to provide a high-power FET gallium arsenide chip which has heat extracted from the transistors by means of
