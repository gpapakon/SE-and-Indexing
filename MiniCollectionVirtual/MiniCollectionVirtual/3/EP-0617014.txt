<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel oxime ether type compound 
useful as a fungicide, processes for preparing the same and 
a fungicide containing the same as an effective ingredient. As an oxime ether type compound, there have been known, for 
example, those as described in Japanese Provisional Patent 
Publications No. 23852/1988 (which corresponds to U.S. 
Patent No. 4,829,085 and U.S.P. Re 33,989) and No. 246268/1991 
(which corresponds to U.S. Patent No. 5,185,342). 
However, the chemical structures of these compounds at the 
side chain are quite different from that of the present 
invention and fungicidal activities thereof are also insufficient. The oxime ether type compound of the present invention and 
a synthetic intermediate thereof are novel compounds. 
Thus, it has not been known the oxime ether type compound 
of the present invention have an excellent fungicidal 
activity.  
 EP-A-0 378 308 discloses acrylate fungicides of the following 
formula (I) 
 
wherein X is O or S, W is CH or N, m is 0 or 1 and n may be 0 
or 1 and Q is R2-N=CR1- wherein R1 is alkyl, alkoxyl or 
alkylthio wherein when W is nitrogen, R2 can be unsubstituted 
phenyl. Example 33 of this document relates to a fungicidal 
compound wherein Q is 1-(phenylimino)propyl.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
oxime ether type compound and a synthetic intermediate 
thereof, processes for preparing said compounds, and a 
fungicide containing the novel oxime ether type compound as 
an effective ingredient. The present inventors have studied intensively in order to 
achieve the above object, and consequently found that a 
novel oxime ether type compound having the following 
chemical structure has an excellent fungicidal activity as 
an agricultural and horticultural fungicide and the novel 
compound can be used as a synthetic intermediate thereof, 
to accomplish the present invention. That is, the first invention relates to an oxime ether type 
compound represented by the formula (I): 
 
   wherein R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 
carbon atoms; R2 represents OR5 or NHR6 where R5 and 
R6 each represent an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms; R3 represents a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 
carbon atoms; R4 represents an alkenyloxy group having 
3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkynyloxy group having 3 to 6 
carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 10 carbon 
atoms, a benzyloxy group, an alkoxycarbonyl group having 
2 to 7 carbon atoms, a halogen atom, a cyano 
group, an alkylthio group having 1 to 6
