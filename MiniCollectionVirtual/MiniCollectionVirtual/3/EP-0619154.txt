Straightening apparatus for wire, multiple wire or tubular 
products with a plurality of rotating straightening rollers (1) 

arranged in two parallel planes (A, B), whereof the journals (2) 
are mounted in cassettes (3), which are located in a housing 

holder (9), characterised in that each cassette (3) has a housing 
in the form of a hollow cylinder (3') and is interchangeably 

located in position-orientated mating bores (10). 
Straightening apparatus for wire, multiple wire or tubular 
products with a plurality of rotating straightening rollers (1) 

arranged in two parallel planes (A, B), whereof the journals (2) 
are mounted in cassettes (3), which are located in a housing 

holder (9), at least the cassettes (3) of one plane (B) being 
arranged so that they can be adjusted by means of an adjusting 

device, characterised in that each cassette (3) comprises a 
housing in the form of a hollow cylinder (3') and is 

interchangeably located in position-orientated mating bores (10; 
10'). 
Straightening apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the hollow cylindrical housing (3') is 

sealed with respect to the straightening roller (1) by means of 
a labyrinth packing. 
Straightening apparatus according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the labyrinth packing comprises an annular 

groove (8) in the straightening roller (1), serving to receive 
the upper edge of the hollow cylindrical housing (3'). 
Straightening apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, in which the axial forces transmitted by the straightening 

roller (1) to the journal (2) are received by a ball bearing (5) 
and the radial forces are received by a needle bearing (7), 

characterised in that the ball race is constructed directly in 
the hollow cylindrical housing (3') or in the journal (2) and the  

 
needle bearing (7) is located directly between the housing (3') 

and journal (2). 
Straightening apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 
5, in which an adjusting device with a grooved block (11), an 

adjusting spindle (13) and an adjusting knob (15) is provided, 
characterised in that the surface of the adjusting knob (15) 

facing the housing holder (9) and/or the wall (14) on the housing 
holder (9), against which the adjusting knob (15) bears, 

comprise/comprises a structure and/or overlay increasing 
friction. 
Straightening apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the overlay increasing friction is a rubber 

disc (19). 
Straightening apparatus according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the adjusting knob (15) is arranged on the 

adjusting spindle (13) so that it is able to move axially and is 
not able to rotate and is pressed by means of a biased spring 

(16) against the wall (14) of the housing holder (9).
