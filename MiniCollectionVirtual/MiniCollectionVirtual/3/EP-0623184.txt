<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to locks and more particularly a pin 
tumbler cylinder lock that can be re-keyed to be opened by a key 
whose teeth can be arranged in a mating longitudinal sequence to 
open the lock. In the past most pin tumbler cylinder locks were not capable 
of being re-keyed. As a consequence, if a person lost his key, it 
was often necessary to replace the entire lock or require the 
services of a locksmith. U.S. patent 3,432,757 is directed to a multiple key 
lock having a change key mechanism. It is a conventional pin-type 
key operated lock having a blocking needle originally 
positioned in a cavity in the shell adjacent the rotatable core 
locking certain inoperable pins, with the shell parts thereof 
inoperable in the shell and free of blocking a remaining operable 
pin.  
 In more recent years, improved pin tumbler cylinder locks have been 
designed which allow a combination to be changed. U.S. Patent 3,910,083 
discloses a combination changing cylinder lock that allows the service key to be 
changed externally without access to the lock interior. The Monahan U.S. Patent 4,712,401 relates to a method of re-keying a 
pin tumbler cylinder lock having tumbler pins, driver pins and at least one master 
pin without disassembly of the lock apparatus or removal or replacement of any 
master pins therefrom.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide a novel lock and 
key assembly that has a key whose teeth are removable and 
rearrangeable in various sequences. It is also an object of the invention to provide a novel 
universal lock and key assembly that has structure for 
temporarily locking its top pins in its top pin housing portion 
while its bottom pins are being removed. It is another object of the invention to provide a novel 
universal lock and key assembly that has structure for removing 
its bottom pins from its tubular sleeve without disassembling 
these two members from each other. It is an additional object of the invention to provide a 
novel lock and key assembly that is economical to manufacture and 
market. It is a further object of the invention to provide a novel 
lock and key assembly that is can have the teeth of its key and 
the bottom pins of its bottom pin cylinder rearranged by an 
untrained do-it-yourselfer.  
 Accordingly, the invention proposes a universal lock and key system as 
defined in claim 1. In a preferred form, the top pin housing portion has an elongated control 
sheet slot extending horizontally inwardly from one of its sides all  
 
the way into the

<CLAIMS>
A universal lock and key system in which the lock is re-keyable and the 
key is re-keyable comprising: 


a combination top pin housing and tubular sleeve assembly (70) having a 
top pin housing portion (72) and a tubular sleeve portion (73) and they each have 

a front end and a rear end; 
said top pin housing portion (72) having a longitudinal axis, a top end and 
a bottom end, a plurality of top pin bore holes (75) are formed in said top pin 

housing portion and they extend upwardly from its bottom end, said top pin bore 
holes being aligned with said longitudinal axis, a top pin (77) and spring (76) 

removable received in most of said bore holes; 
said tubular sleeve portion (73) being formed on the bottom end of said 
top pin housing portion and they have aligned longitudinal axes, said bore holes 

of said top pin housing portion being in communication with the interior of said 
tubular sleeve portion (73); 
a bottom pin cylinder (94) having a longitudinal axis, a front end, a rear 
end, a top surface and a bottom surface; a key slot (95) extends longitudinally 

a predetermined distance into said bottom pin cylinder from its front end, a 
plurality of longitudinally aligned bottom pin bore holes (98) extend from said 

top surface into said key slot, a plurality of bottom pins (100) are removably 
mounted in said bottom pin bore holes; and. 
said bottom pin cylinder (94) being removably mounted in said tubular 
sleeve portion (73); characterised by means for locking said top pins in said top 

pin housing portion comprising a longitudinally extending control sheet slot (86) 
that extends horizontally into said top pin housing (72) from its outer surface to 

said top pin bore holes (75) and a control sheet (83) that is movable in and out 
of said control sheet slot (86) from a position where it engages said top pins (77) 

to a position where said top pins are completely disengaged. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in claim 1, further comprising 
gear means for driving said sheet in and out of its top pin engagement position. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in claim 1 or 2, further 
comprising a control pin in one of the top pin bore holes. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in claim 1, 2 or 3, further 
comprising means to limit longitudinal insertion of a key in said key slot. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in any preceding claim, further 
comprising means for locking said bottom pin cylinder in said tubular sleeve 

portion. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in any preceding claim, further 
comprising a shoulder on the rear end of said bottom pin cylinder for actuating 

means for unlatching a locking mechanism. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in any preceding claim, 
wherein said top pin bore holes extend upwardly to the top end of said top pin 

housing portion and a removable cover is secured thereto. 
A universal lock and key system as recited in any preceding claim, further 
comprising said tubular sleeve portion having means for removing said bottom 

pins from said bottom pin cylinder while said bottom pin cylinder remains in said 
tubular sleeve portion.

an elongated shank portion (52) having a front end, a rear end, and a top 
surface; a tooth slot (40) is formed in said top surface and it extends forwardly from 

the rear end of said shank portion a predetermined distance, said tooth slot 
having a left side wall (44), a right side wall (45) and a bottom wall, a laterally extending 

groove is formed in at least one of said side walls; 
a plurality of key teeth (50) having various predetermined heights, each tooth 
having a left side wall, a right side wall and a bottom wall, each of said teeth 

having at least one flange (47) extending laterally from one of its side walls so that 
said teeth can be slid into the rear of said tooth slot with said flange mating with 

said laterally extending groove; 
a key handle (56); and 
means (60) for removably securing said key handle to the rear end of said 
shank portion.
