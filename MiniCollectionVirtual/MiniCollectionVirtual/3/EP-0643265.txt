<ABSTRACT>
The burner is operated at a distance from the flame stability limit. The light intensity is measured as the flame characteristic which represents the state of combustion. A mean value signal is formed therefrom, as is a signal for the standard deviations. Furthermore, a specific value of the standard deviations is defined. This value is assigned a different mean value signal depending on the type of gas. The controller detects from this assignment the type of gas with which the burner is being operated, and prescribes a corresponding desired value for the mean value signal, doing so with the aid of a family of characteristics (characteristics map), or as the distance from the actual value of the mean value signal assigned to the defined value of the standard deviations.

Method for controlling an excess-air premix gas burner, wherein a flame
property representative of the state of combustion is measured, a measured

quantity is obtained, a mean-value signal is formed therefrom and used to
control the gas and/or air mass flow,

characterised in that

the standard deviation of the measured quantity is recorded, assigned to the
mean-value signal for determining the state of combustion and additionally

used for adjustment and control, whereby

a) the gas and/or air mass flow is varied until a specified threshold of the
standard deviation is reached;
b) the actual value of the mean-value signal is recorded on reaching the
threshold of the standard deviation;
c) a setpoint of the mean-value signal is specified at a specified distance
from the actual value of the mean-value signal recorded in step b);
d) the gas and/or air mass flow is controlled using the setpoint of the
mean-value signal obtained in step c); and
e) steps a) to d) are repeated as required and/or periodically.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that

f) the setpoint of the mean-value signal obtained in step c) is stored:
g) a value of the standard deviation recorded once on reaching the
setpoint of the mean-value signal is stored;
h) the ratio between the actual values of the mean-value signal and the
standard deviation is monitored;
i) the ratio according to h) is compared with the ratio of the values stored
in steps f) and g); and
k) steps a) to d) are repeated if the ratios compared in step i) diverge
significantly.
Method according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that

a value of the standard deviation recorded once on reaching the setpoint of
the mean-value signal is stored;
the actual value of the standard deviation is monitored;
the actual value of the standard deviation is compared with the stored value of
the standard deviation; and 
steps a) to d) are repeated if the values compared with each other diverge
significantly.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
characteristic values as a function of the type of gas are specified for the

threshold of the standard deviations, for the actual value of the mean-value
signal assigned to said threshold and for the distance of the setpoint of the

mean-value signal from said actual value, that on approaching the threshold
of the standard deviations the type of gas is identified from the assigned

actual value of the mean-value signal, and that, as a function of the type of
gas, the associated threshold and the associated distance of the setpoint of

the mean-value signal from the actual value of the mean-value signal
assigned to said threshold are selected.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that on
approaching the threshold of the standard deviations the frequency of

threshold overruns is recorded, and that the threshold of the standard
deviation is considered to have been reached only if the threshold overruns

occur with a specified frequency.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
measured quantity of the flame property representing the state of combustion

is used for flame supervision.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the light
intensity is measured as the flame property representative of the state of

combustion.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the light
intensity is measured over one or more radiation ranges as the flame property

representative of the state of combustion.
Method according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that infra-red radiation is
excluded when measuring the light intensity.
Method according to any one of claims 7 to 9, characterised in that
measurement of light intensity occurs within an adjustable field of view of the

flame range.
