<ABSTRACT>
A test apparatus includes an optical 
displacement transducer (40) for sensing deformation of the 

cigarette filter (13) responsive to a predetermined load 
applied transverse to the filter during simulated 

smoking of the cigarette, and a barcode laser scanner (50) 
for sensing relative movement of a charline (54) along a 

tobacco rod (14) of the burning cigarette during simulated 
smoking. The optical displacement transducer thus 

produces a filter hot collapse signal, while the 
barcode laser scanner produces a tobacco consumption 

signal. A processor (20), such as a microprocessor 
operating under stored program control, samples the hot 

collapse signal and the tobacco consumption signal to 
generate a series of respective data points. A display (45) 

is operatively connected to the processor for 
generating a graphical representation of at least one 

of the hot collapse signal and the tobacco consumption 
signal as a function of time, based upon the respective 

sampled data points.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of test 
apparatus for cigarettes, and more particularly, to a 
tester and associated method for cigarette filters. The hardness or firmness of a cigarette 
filter is a significant indicator of the quality of the 
cigarette. Smokers generally prefer a filter which 
substantially retains its hardness, and therefore its 
shape, during smoking. The effectiveness of the filter 
may also suffer should the filter collapse during 
smoking. In addition, a relatively hard filter rod, 
from which individual filters are cut, is more easily 
handled during the manufacturing of cigarettes. A typical cigarette filter is formed of 
cellulose acetate filaments and includes certain 
additives which cause bonding of adjacent or 
intersecting portions of the cellulose acetate 
filaments. Thus, a predetermined initial or "cold" 
hardness for the filter may be obtained by selecting 
the desired additives and applying them in desired 
quantities. However, during smoking "hot collapse", 
occurs. In other words, smoke condensate and other 
factors cause the fibers to soften leading to a loss in  
 
hardness of the filter. This hot collapse is readily 
perceived to be a sensory defect by the smoker, and is 
particularly noticeable over the last few puffs of a 
cigarette when the hot collapse ii greatest. An increase in additives to enhance the "cold 
hardness" of a filter tends to increase the problem 
with hot collapse during smoking. (See, for example, 
report entitled RHODIA Hardness-Tester HDS-4, by Rhodia 
AG of Freiburg West Germany, (1983)). Accordingly, it 
is important for a manufacturer to be able to determine 
the optimum additive amount for each type of filter. 
In addition, the hot collapse is strongly influenced by 
the moisture content of the tobacco rod. Yet other 
factors which influence hot collapse are the filament 
denier of the cellulose acetate, the total denier or 
density of the packing of the filaments in the filter, 
and the residual crimping of the filaments. Several manufacturers have developed test 
equipment for measuring the hot collapse of a cigarette 
filter during simulated smoking. For example, Rhodia 
AG has developed a hot collapse tester identified under 
the model designation HDS-4. The tester includes a 
holder for maintaining the cigarette in a conventional 
horizontal position during the test. A mechanical 
linkage and counterbalancing weight cooperate with a 
stamp to provide a compressive load downwardly onto the 
filter during simulated smoking of
