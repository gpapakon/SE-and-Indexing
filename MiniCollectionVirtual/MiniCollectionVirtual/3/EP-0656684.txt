<ABSTRACT>
In the case of known oscillator circuits, it is difficult to ensure a smooth transient response (transient behaviour) of the oscillator circuit during turn-on and turn-off operations. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to specify an oscillator circuit which solves this problem using uncomplicated circuitry. The oscillator circuit according to the invention has a push-pull stage, which is operated in blocking mode and the driving voltage divider of which is permanently connected to the operating voltage. The oscillator circuit is turned on and off by switching the operating voltage which is present across the push-pull stage.

An oscillator circuit comprising a resonant circuit (L, C2, C3) and an
active part which is formed by a push-pull transistor stage (T1, T2) operated in the cutoff

mode, the push-pull transistor stage (T1, T2) being driven by means of a voltage
divider (R2, R5),

characterized in that

the voltage divider (R2, R5) is constantly connected to a voltage source which provides

the operating voltage (U), a current flowing through the push-pull transistor stage (T1,
T2) and the inductance (L) of the resonant circuit (L, C2, C3) via the voltage divider

(R2, R5), and
the oscillator circuit is turned on and turned off by means of a switch (S) which applies
the operating voltage (U) to the push-pull transistor stage (T2, T5).
An oscillator circuit as claimed in Claim 1,

characterized in that,

in order to improve the transient response of the oscillator circuit, an RC element (R1,
C1) and a resistor (R3) have been provided, the RC element (C1, R1) causing the

operating voltage at the push-pull stage to change continuously during turning-on and
turning-off, and
the resonant circuit (L, C2, C3) being excited into resonance via the resistor (R3)
arranged in parallel with the collector-emitter junction of the transistor (T1) when the

operating voltage at the push-pull stage is too low for switching the transistor (T1)
connected to the switch (S).
An oscillator circuit as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the oscillator circuit is used for driving an erase head in a magnetic recording and
reproducing apparatus.
An oscillator circuit as claimed in Claim 3,

characterized in that

the inductance (L) of the resonant circuit (L, C2, C3) is formed by the erase head.
