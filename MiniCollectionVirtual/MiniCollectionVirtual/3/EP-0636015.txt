<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR IMPLANT PROSTHESESField of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the process of surgical tissue recontouring using implantable prostheses. More specifically, the present invention relates to a prostheses comprising human adipose tissue, preferably of autologous origin, contained within an impermeable or semi-permeable membrane capable of implantation during reconstructive or elective surgery such as mammoplasty.Background of the Invention The use of implantable prostheses for human body recontouring, for use primarily in the area of breast reconstruction following traumatic or surgical loss of breast tissue or, electively to augment a condition of developmental hypoplasia has been documented for over 80 years. Typically, the prostheses or implant consists of a flexible envelope containing a liquid or gelatinous material. The envelope is commonly made from silicone, polyurethane or other bio-compatible polymers with varying degrees of elastic memory and permeability. Prior art implants have been filled with a variety of materials such as foam rubber, saline and silicone oil or gel. For many years, silicone filled implants were held out as the clinically accepted standard and superior to other known filling agents, silicone being an inert substance and a natural lubricant. However, silicone filled implants have come under recent criticism by governmental regulatory agencies, members of the medical community and the public at large due to widespread reports of chronic adverse effects such as inflammation, calcification, allergic reactions and even more serious complications resulting from either traumatic rupture of the envelope or the migration of silicone through the envelope membrane or valve into the surrounding tissue and even into the bloodstream. The human body is incapable of eliminating the silicone, thereby requiring the surgical removal of the silicone and treatment of the resulting complications or disease states. Another disadvantage of silicone filled implants is that silicone is radiopaque or radiodense, causing significant obstruction and interference with radiology procedures. 

 Saline filled implants have for some time been considered a viable alternative to silicone implants and have recently, by default, become the implant/fillant of choice. Implants filled with physiological saline (0.9%) are isotonic and bio- compatible with the fluids of the human body. Therefore, the human body possesses the ability to eliminate the saline which may leak

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An implant prostheses comprising: a flexible envelope; a volume of mammalian triglyceride containing adipose tissue retained within said flexible envelope.
2. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said mammalian triglyceride containing tissue is of human origin.
3. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said human adipose tissue is autologous to a recipient of said implant prostheses.
4. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said mammalian adipose tissue is derived from a cadaver.
5. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said mammalian non- fibrous tissue comprises fatty acids and glycerol.
6. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said implant prostheses further comprises an antimicrobial within said envelope.
7. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said implant prostheses further comprises one or more components from the group consisting of anticoagulants, buffers, and antioxidants.
8. The implant prostheses as recited in claim 1 wherein said flexible envelope comprises one or more materials from the group of materials consisting of silicones, polyurethanes and bio-compatible polymers. 


9. A method for producing an implant prostheses comprising the steps of:
(a) obtaining a reservoir of mammalian triglyceride containing adipose tissue;
(b) introducing a determined volume of said adipose tissue from said reservoir into a flexible envelope of suitable material for use as a prosthetic shell;
(c) sealing said flexible envelope containing said adipose tissue, said adipose tissue being incapable of maintaining viability within said envelope.
10. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 9 wherein said adipose tissue from step (a) is autologous to a recipient of said prostheses.
11. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 9 wherein said adipose tissue from step (a) is obtained from an essentially tissue compatible donor.
12. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 9 wherein said adipose tissue from step (a) is derived from a cadaver.
13. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 9 comprising the further step of:
(d) surgically implanting said adipose tissue containing envelope.
14. A method for producing an implant prostheses comprising the steps of:
(a) obtaining a reservoir of mammalian triglyceride containing adipose tissue;
(b) introducing at least a portion of a determined volume of said adipose tissue from said reservoir into a flexible envelope of suitable material for use as a prosthetic shell;
(c) surgically implanting said flexible envelope containing at least a portion of said determined volume of said adipose tissue;
(d) introducing a remainder of said determined volume of said adipose tissue into said flexible envelope, and 


 (e) sealing said flexible envelope containing said adipose tissue.
15. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 14 wherein said adipose tissue from step (a) is autologous to a recipient of said prostheses.
16. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 14 wherein said adipose tissue from step (a) is obtained from an essentially tissue compatible donor.
17. The method for producing an implant prostheses as recited in claim 14 wherein said adipose tissue from step (a) is derived from a cadaver.
