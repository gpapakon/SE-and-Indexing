<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of low 
density, porous, crosslinked, polymeric materials, 
particularly by reducing the curing time in a high internal 
phase emulsion polymerization process. Polymeric foams can be classified as either 
closed-cell foams or as open-cell foams. Open-cell foams 
can be used as a matrix to contain various liquids and 
gases. They are capable of various industrial 
applications, for example as wipes and diapers, as carriers 
and ion exchange resins. For some of these applications, 
it is desirable to have porous crosslinked polymer blocks 
which have a very low density and a high capacity of 
absorbing and retaining liquids. Such high absorption 
capacity, low density, porous polymer blocks can be 
prepared by polymerizing a specific type of water-in-oil 
emulsion known as high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) 
having relatively small amounts of a continuous oil phase 
and relatively greater amounts of an internal or disperse 
water phase. Further, other properties such as good 
wicking and good retention of liquid under load (i.e. low 
compressive strain or resistance to compression deflection) 
are also desirable for use as an absorbent. Typically, these high absorption capacity, low 
density foams are prepared by forming a high internal phase 
water-in-oil emulsion (typical water to oil weight ratio of 
above 9:1 in the presence of a surfactant and polymerizing 
the monomers in the oil phase of the emulsion with a 
polymerization initiator at a temperature around 60°C for 
about 8 hours. However, it has been found that in order to 
obtain foams with better properties, curing must be 
conducted for 16 hours or longer at a temperature of 60°C. 
Further, to produce these foams in a continuous process, it 
is desirable to heat the emulsion rapidly and to reduce the  
 
curing time. Therefore, it would be advantageous to reduce 
the curing time and to heat the emulsion rapidly without 
significantly affecting the resulting foam properties. However, it has been found that by raising the 
temperature rapidly above 65°C, the emulsion deteriorates 
thereby affecting the resulting foam products. Therefore, 
it would be desirable to be able rapidly to heat the 
emulsion and/or reduce the curing time without degrading 
the water-in-oil emulsion and adversely affecting the foam 
product properties. The present invention seeks to provide a process 
to prepare low density, porous crosslinked polymeric foams 
with improved absorption properties, particularly by 
reducing curing
