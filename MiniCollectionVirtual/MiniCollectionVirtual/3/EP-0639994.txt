<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to breathing equipment for 
aircrew and more particularly to breathing equipment 
which can be used in conjunction with electronic 
avionic systems. Avionic systems used by pilots generally require part 
of the system to be helmet mounted but the helmet has 
to be maintained in a fixed position relative to the 
wearer's head and eyes if the avionics are to work 
properly. Another problem with modern breathing equipment used 
by aircrew is that it has to incorporate means to 
increase the seal that the facemask makes with the 
wearer's face during pressure breathing otherwise the 
facemask leaks when the breathable gas at the 
required increased pressure is fed to the interior of 
the mask. In one prior art arrangement, an 
inflatable bag is provided at the rear of the pilot's 
helmet which expands when pressure breathing is 
required with the result that the helmet moves  
 
rearwardly and the facemask connected to it is pulled 
towards the wearer's face to maintain the required 
seal therewith. The problem with this arrangement is 
that the helmet moves relative to the pilot's head so 
avionics systems cannot be mounted to it as they 
require a stable mounting platform. Furthermore, as 
the viewing screen onto which the avionics image is 
projected must be kept at a fixed distance from the 
wearer's eyes, it cannot be mounted on a facemask 
which moves relative to the wearer's face because its 
position relative to the pilot's eyes will change 
constantly in response to the pressure of the 
breathable gas supplied to the facemask. In our earlier filed patent application referred to 
above, which has been published under 
No.PCT/GB91/01034 
corresponding to WO-A-92/00120, 
we overcame the problem of keeping 
the helmet in a fixed position by mounting the 
movable facemask within a rigid outer shell attached 
to the helmet at a fixed distance therefrom and 
fitting an inflatable bladder between the rigid shell 
and the facemask which could be inflated to press the 
periphery of the facemask towards the pilot's face  
 
when the pressure of the breathable gas supplied to 
the interior of the mask and the inflatable bladder 
increased above that for normal breathing. In 
another embodiment, the facemask included a 
re-entrant or bellows section which reconfigured and 
extended in a direction towards the pilot's face when 
the pressure of the breathable gas supplied to the 
interior of the facemask increased above that 
required for normal breathing. The significant feature of our

<CLAIMS>
Breathing apparatus for aircrew comprising a rigid 
outer shell (4) in which a flexible face-piece (3) is 

received whose periphery is adapted to make a seal with 
the pilot's face, the face-piece incorporating an 

inspiratory and expiratory valve and the outer shell (4) 
having means for attaching it at a fixed distance from 

the wearer's face, the face-piece (3) further including 
extendable means (20) automatically operable to press the 

periphery of the face-piece (3) towards the pilot's face 
to improve the seal therewith when gas at a pressure 

above that required for normal breathing is supplied to 
the face-piece (3) and the extendable means (20) 

reconfigure as a result thereof 
characterised by
 
transparent viewing means (14) mounted on the rigid outer 

shell (4) in a fixed position relative thereto and 
located in the wearer's line of sight. 
Breathing apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the outer shell (4) comprises the rigid front piece of a 

flexible NBC hood which incorporates a viewing window 
(31) therein as an integral part thereof. 
Breathing apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the viewing means (14) comprises a transparent screen 

mounted on means extending from the rigid shell (4) into 
the pilot's line of sight.  

 
Breathing apparatus as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the extendable means (20) is a bladder (30) 

located between the rigid outer shell (4) and face-piece 
(3). 
Breathing apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1-3 
wherein bellows-like configurations (23) are provided at 

the periphery of the face-piece (3) which are extendable 
when gas is supplied to the interior thereof. 
Breathing apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1-3 
wherein the extendable means (20) comprises an inflatable 

bladder (30) in combination with bellows (23) or similar 
reconfigurable means.
