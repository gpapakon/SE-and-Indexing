<ABSTRACT>
The method for producing a brush (10) for an electric motor, comprising a wear block (20) and a connection braid (4), comprises a step a) in which a powder mixture comprising a conductive powder coated with a binder is prepared, a step b) in which the mixture is moulded in a mould with incorporation of the said braid, in order to form a green (unfired) brush, and a step c) in which the said green brush is fired, and is characterized in that, so as to obtain a brush to the final dimensions directly, at least one mixture M1 is prepared at step a), this mixture comprising a distillation binder L and at least one powder P1 of graphite in the form of solid particles having an average thickness less than 25  mu m and having a high form factor F1 (ratio of the large dimension to the small dimension), this average form factor being greater than 5.

A process for the production of a brush (1, 10) for an electric motor, comprising a 
wearing block (2, 20) and a connecting braid (4), comprising a step (a) for the preparation 

of at least one mixture of powder comprising at least one conductive powder encased with a 
binder, a step (b) for compression moulding of the mixture(s) in a mould (6) with 

incorporation of said braid (4) so as to form a rough brush (8), and a step (c) for baking said 
rough brush (8), characterised in that in order to obtain an inexpensive brush (1, 10) by direct 

moulding to the final dimensions, in step (a) at least one mixture M1 is prepared which 
comprises a distillation binder L, and which is constituted by the distillation product of coal 

or petroleum or by a product derived from such a distillation product, and at least one 
smaller than 25 

graphite powder P1 in the form of solid particles of mean thickness smaller than 25 µm and with a mean 
shape factor F1 (large dimension/small dimension ratio) high and greater than 5. 
A process according to Claim 1, wherein said mixture M1 comprises said powder P1, 
said binder L and a graphite powder P2 with a low degree of slenderness, with a low mean 

shape factor F2 of less than 3. 
A process according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said mixture M1 is 
constituted by a mixture of 15 to 75% by weight of said powder P1, by 30 to 25% by weight 

of said binder L, and by 0 to 55% by weight of said powder P2. 
A process according to Claim 3, wherein said mixture Ml is constituted preferably by 
a mixture of 30 to 60% by weight of said powder P1, by 30 to 25% by weight of said binder 

L, and by 15 to 40% by weight of said powder P2. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein said graphite powder P1 is 
in the form of flakes (particles of marked bi-dimensional character) with a high degree of 

slenderness.  
 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein said graphite powder P2 
with a low degree of slenderness is in grain form (particles of marked tri-dimensional 

character) with a mean shape factor F2 close to 1. 
A process according to Claim 6, wherein said powder P2 has a mean diameter of 
between 10 and 200 µm and preferably of between 30 and 100 µm. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein in step (a) two separate 
mixtures are prepared of powders M1 and M2, M2 comprising a graphite powder, a copper 

powder and a synthetic binder, and in step (b) a superposed arrangement of two layers is 
compressed, a lower layer C1 constituted by a mixture M1 of powders and an upper layer C2 

constituted by a mixture M2 of powders, after the end of said braid (4) has been incorporated 
in said upper layer C2. 
A process according to Claim 8, wherein said mixture M2 comprises a graphite powder 
agglomerated by a synthet
ic binder and a copper powder in a proportion by weight of between 
15 and 35%. 
A process according to Claim 9, wherein said synthetic binder is preferably a phenolic 
resin. 
A process according to any one of Claims 8 to 10, wherein the amounts of mixtures 
M1 and M2 are selected in such a way that after compression a multi-layer brush is obtained 

in which said upper layer C2 in which said braid (4) is anchored is of a height of between 2 
and 10 mm, the height of said layers, which corresponds to the direction in which said 

mixtures are compressed in said mould, being in a "height of layer Cl / height of layer C2" 
ratio of between 2 and 30. 
A process according to Claim 11, wherein the slenderness factor p of said brush, 
defined by the "height / square root of the section" ratio is between 2 and 6.  

 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein, in step (a) said mixture M1 
is mixed with a solution in solvent medium of a synthetic binder with at least 25% by weight 

of non-dilute material and the mixing is carried out until homogenisation of said mixture M1 
and of said solution in solvent medium, and elimination of said solvent from said solution. 
A process according to Claim 13, wherein from 5 to 20 parts of synthetic binder 
(expressed as non-dilute material) is incorporated in 90 parts of mixture M1. 
A process according to Claim 14, wherein said synthetic binder is preferably a 
phenolic resin and said solvent is preferably an alcohol.
