<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel pyrazolotriazole 
derivatives or salts thereof which show an angiotensin II (to 
be referred to as AII hereinafter) antagonism. AII, a physiologically active peptide which shows a 
strong pressor reaction, has been regarded as a causal 
substance of hypertension in various mammalian species. There are a few known pathways for the formation of 
AII in the living body, including a typical pathway in which 
angiotensin I is formed from angiotensinogen by the action of 
an enzyme, renin, and then converted into AII by the action 
of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Since the 
compound of the present invention inhibits expression of 
functions AII by acting on the AII receptor, it is useful as 
an AII antagonist. Examples of known AII antagonists include imidazole 
derivatives disclosed in European Patent No. 253,310. The inventors of the present invention have created 
various types of compounds and subjected them to screening 
and, as the result, found pyrazolotriazole derivatives which  
 
have excellent anti-AII activity and whose chemical structure 
is different from those of the prior art compounds. The pyrazolotriazole derivative of the present 
invention is represented by the following general formula. 
(Each symbol in the above formula means as follows;
 
R¹, R³ and R⁴: one of them represents a hydrogen atom, a 
biphenylmethyl group having a tetrazolyl group which may be 
substituted by aralkyl, or a lower alkyl group, and each of 
the remaining two has no substituent,
 
R²: a hydrogen atom, a biphenylmethyl group having a 
tetrazolyl group which may be substituted by aralkyl, a 
cycloalkyl group, or a lower alkyl group which may be 
substituted by hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, carboxyl or lower 
alkoxycarbonyl, and
 
R⁵ and R⁶: these may be the same or different from each 
other, and each represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a 
biphenylmethyl group having a tetrazolyl group which may be 
substituted by aralkyl, a formyl group, a carboxyl group, an 
esterified carboxyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a lower alkoxy 
group, or a lower alkyl group which may be substituted by  
 
hydroxyl, formyl, carboxyl, lower alkoxy or lower 
alkoxycarbonyl,
 
provided that at least one of R¹ to R⁶ is a biphenylmethyl 
group having a tetrazolyl group which may be substituted by 
aralkyl and the broken lines mean that the pyrazolotriazole 
ring forms three double bonds.) The following describes the compound of the present 
invention in detail. Unless otherwise indicated, the term
