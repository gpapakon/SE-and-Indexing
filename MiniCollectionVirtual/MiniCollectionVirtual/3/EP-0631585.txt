<ABSTRACT>
A process for the microbial production of a protein susceptible to inactivation in a fluid production medium by constinuously and reversibly protecting said protein against said inactivation during the production stage, separating the protein from the production medium, deprotecting the protein, and recovering the protein product. The process is especially useful for obtaining substantially increased yields of the protein in question by continuously precipitating said protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of producing and
recovering proteins, and especially recombinant proteins. The
methods are particular useful for microbial production and
subsequent recovery of the proteins from the growth medium.In production, and especially microbial production, of proteins
the instability of these proteins during the production
process, especially the fermentation process is of major
concern to assure the profitability of the production.When using recombinant techniques for the production of
heterologous proteins it has been found that the protein
product often forms aggregates which are recognizable within
the cell as "inclusion bodies" (Williams et al Science 215
(1982) 687-689).With the accumulation of the protein in the cytoplasm or the
periplasmatic space either as inclusion bodies or in an
otherwise aggregated or complexed state, many proteins have
been found to be protected against proteolysis or other
modifications in the production organism.In the fluid production medium protease inhibitors like bovine
aprotinin have been added to protect heterologous products like
insulin against proteolytic digestion in mammalian culture
(Johnson et al. in Kininogenases-kallikrein 4 eds. Haberland et
al (1977) 113-118, Schattauer-Verlag), and a similar result has
been obtained by Novikov et al. (Biotech. Lett. 12 (1990) 547-550) 
with addition of synthetic serin proteinase inhibitors to
the growth medium in a fermentation of a Bacillus subtilis
strain expressing proinsulin.Autoproteolysis has been shown to be a quite common event in
biological systems. By use of an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases
a higher level of the proteinases cathepsin B, H and C
has been found in rats (Kominami et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res.
Comm. 144 (1987) 749-756). Connor (Biochem. J. 263 (1989) 601-604)
has shown that procathepsin D undergo autoproteolytic
change to produce the mature cathepsin D even at low concentrations
(< 1 g/ml). In bovine heart the Ca-dependent
protease II seems to be activated by autoproteolytic cleavage
of a subunit and by further successive cleavages the Ca-dependence
of the protease is lowered (Demartino et al, J. Biol.
Chem. 261 (1986) 12047-12052).In microorganisms autoproteolysis was shown to be the most
likely cause to the maturation of a subtilisin type protease in
Bacillus subtilis during the secretion of the proform (Power et
al, PNAS 83 (1986) 3096-3100). Later studies by Zhu et al.
(Nature 339 (1989) 483-484) and Egnell and Flock (Gene 97
(1991) 49-54) have shown that
