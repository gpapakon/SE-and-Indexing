Long-time stable electrode with a high 
surface capacitance and low resistance for a 

double-layer capacitor, comprising 

a chemically stable carrier 
an active layer of sub-stoichiometric, hydrated 
metal oxides 
a base layer of precious metals on the carrier 
an electrically conductive, oxidic intermediate 
layer between the carrier and the active layer. 
Electrode according to claim 1, in which 
the metal oxides are obtained in powder form by 

precipitation with leaching from chloride-containing 
metal salt solutions of the elements 

ruthenium, iridium, tantalum, titanium, and 
platinum or other elements of the groups IVB to 

VIIIB of the periodic table and subsequent thermal 
conversion. 
Electrode according to claim 1, wherein 
the metal oxides are obtained in powder form from 

chloride-containing metal salts of the elements 
ruthenium, iridium, tantalum, titanium, and 

platinum or other elements of the groups IVB to 
VIIIB of the periodic table under addition of a  

 
water-soluble salt and by means of thermal 

decomposition, and the salt is subsequently 
dissolved out again. 
Electrode according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the carrier consists of 

lattices, sheets or felts of nickel, titanium or 
valve metals or graphite. 
Electrode according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the base layer consists 

of galvanically separated nuclei of palladium or 
platinum or other precious metals of the group 

VIIIB. 
Electrode according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the intermediate layer 

results from sintering the metal oxide onto the 
carrier at 300-500Â°C and the base layer is shortcircuited 

by the metal nuclei. 
Electrode according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the metal oxide is 

applied to the carrier in conjunction with a 
conductive adhesive. 
Double-layer capacitor unit, comprising at 
least two electrodes according to any one of the  

 
preceding claims. 
Double-layer capacitor unit according to 
claim 8, characterised in that an electrolyte-impregnated 

ceramic matrix based on zirconium 
dioxide is located between the electrodes. 
Double-layer capacitor of units according 
to claim 8, characterised in that the electrodes 

are secured in a casing without a separator. 
Double-layer capacitor of units according 
to claim 8 and claim 9, characterised in that, in 

each case, two units are connected in separate 
casing parts by a common bipolar electrode. 
Double-layer capacitor of units according 
to claim 8 and claim 9, characterised in that the 

units are held together by two casing halves which 
are screwed together.
