<ABSTRACT>
Radiation images of an object, which have been 
recorded on recording media and in which different images 

of at least part of the object are embedded, are read out 
from the recording media, and a plurality of original 

image signals, each of which is made up of a series of 
image signal components, are thereby obtained. The image 

signal components of the original image signals, which 
represent corresponding picture elements in the radiation 

images, are then subtracted from each other, and a 
difference signal representing an image of a specific 

structure of the object is thereby obtained. A smoothing 
process is carried out on an original image signal, and a 

smoothed image signal is thereby obtained. The image 
signal components of the original image signal and the 

difference signal, which represent corresponding picture 
elements in the images, are weighted such that the weight 

given to the original image signal may be made larger as 
the image density represented by the smoothed image 

signal with respect to a picture element becomes lower. 
The weighted image signal components are then averaged. 

A composite image signal obtained from the weighted 
averaging process is utilized for reproduction of a 

visible radiation image of the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
processing an energy subtraction image according to the preamble of claim 1 or 2.Techniques for carrying out subtraction
processing on radiation images have heretofore been
known. When subtraction processing is to be carried out,
a plurality of (basically, two) radiation images recorded
under different conditions are photoelectrically read
out, and digital image signals which represent the
radiation images are thereby obtained. The image signal
components of the digital image signals, which represent
corresponding picture elements in the radiation images,
are then subtracted from each other, and a difference
signal is thereby obtained which represents the image of
a specific structure or part of the object represented by
the radiation images. With the subtraction processing
method, the plurality of digital image signals are
subtracted from each other in order to obtain a
difference signal, and the radiation image of a specific
structure can be reproduced from the difference signal
(US-A-4,816,681). Basically, subtraction processing is carried
out with either the so-called temporal (time difference)
subtraction processing method or the so-called energy
subtraction processing method. In the former method, in
order to extract the image of a specific structure of an
object from the image of the entire object, the image
signal representing a radiation image obtained without
injection of contrast media is subtracted from the image
signal representing a radiation image in which the image
of the specific structure of the object is enhanced by
the injection of contrast media. In the latter method,
an object is exposed to several kinds of radiation having
different energy distributions. Alternatively, the
energy distribution of the radiation carrying image
information of an object, is changed after it has been
irradiated onto one of a plurality of radiation image
recording media, after which the radiation impinges upon
the second radiation image recording medium. In this
manner, a plurality of radiation images, in which
different images of a specific structure of the object
are embedded, are obtained. Thereafter, the image
signals representing the plurality of radiation images
are weighted appropriately, when necessary, and subjected
to a subtraction process, and the image of the specific
structure of the object is thereby extracted.Also, it has been proposed to use stimulable
phosphors in radiation image recording and reproducing
systems. Specifically, a sheet provided with
