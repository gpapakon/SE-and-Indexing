<ABSTRACT>
The corner connection is intended to integrate a flat frame formed by two profiled segments (10A, 10B) linked together by a gusset (11) with a foot (20) perpendicular to the flat frame. According to the invention, the gusset (11) carries second surfaces (2A, 2B) parallel to first surfaces (1A, 1B) carried by the foot (20), clamping means pressing the first surfaces against the second surfaces. Application particularly to cabinets for electrical apparatus including such a connection at its vertices.
