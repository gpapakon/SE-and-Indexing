A process for producing or packing an item (2) with a 
limited period of use or interest, preferably a regularly 

issued periodical or foodstuffs to be consumed within a 
short time, where the consumer item or its packaging is 

fitted by adhesive means or other means of attachment 
with a timer (1) having display means (4; 9; 11 to 14) 

with a display range and/or an energy source adapted to 
the time period of use or consumption, the timer (1) being 

set and/or otherwise configured close to the time of 
production of the item (2), especially at the time of attaching 

it to the consumer item or its packaging,
characterised
 in that
 
the timer is set and/or otherwise configured in a manner, 

that there is synchronism of its display means (4; 9; 11 
to 14) with the actual time and that there is, at the 

same time, an indication of the time of production. 
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in 
that the setting or the configuration of the timer for 

synchronising it with the actual time is effected by a 
suitable relative positioning of an analogue time indicator 

having a timescale, or, in the case of an electronic 
timer having a counter, by producing or destroying circuit 

bridges which effect the actual counting state of 
the counter. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the timer, at the time 
of its attachment to the consumer item or its packaging, 

is individually set or configured, or that a number of 
timers are set or configured directly before combining 

the individual timers to form inter-related groups. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the electronically operating  
 

timer (1) is set in operation by disconnecting an 
electrically conductive bridge (16) or by an electrically 

conducting bridging of a separation point (6) which establishes, 
in particular, the connection with an electric 

energy source. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the chemically operated 
timer (1) is set in operation by supplying an additional 

chemical substance. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the timescale (9, 13) 
is produced by printing the consumer item (2) or its 

packaging. 
A process according to claim 4, 
characterised
 in 
that the electrically conductive bridging of contact regions 

(6) is effected by a conductive print. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that the timer is applied, 
at least partially, by printing or by transfer, more particularly 

from a film carrier, optionally also by a simultaneous 
or sequential application of a plurality of 

layers. 
A consumer item (2) with a timer (1), produced using 
the process according to one of the claims 1 to 8, having 

a timer (1) fixedly connected thereto with a display 
means (4; 9; 11 to 14), where the energy source and/or 

the display range of the timer is adapted to the period 
of use or interest of the consumer item and where the 

timer has means to set and/or configure the timer (1) in 
synchronism with the actual time, providing an indicator 

for the time of production. 
A consumer item according to claim 9, 
characterised
 
in that the timer (1) is provided with a clock  

 
module (14, 15) which has an analogue, digital and/or mechanically 

readable display. 
A consumer item according to claim 9, 
characterised
 
in that the timer (1) is in the form of a chemical 

system or a system operating on a physical basis. 
A consumer item according to claim 11, 
characterised
 
in that the time display is effected by means of a 

colour change produced by chemical reaction on a display 
track (11) having a timescale (9) which provides, in particular, 

a chromatographically moving mark for indicating 
the time. 
A consumer item according to claim 12, 
characterised
 
in that the timer (1) is in the form of a high-pressure 

system and has a container (22) filled with a 
coloured liquid, and an equalising container (24) which 

is connected with the container (22) via a meander-shaped 
capillary (23). 
A consumer item according to claim 12, 
characterised
 
in that the timer (1) is constructed so as to be 

actuable by dispensing with its seclusion with respect to 
the atmosphere. 
A consumer item according to any one of the claims 9 
to 14, 
characterised
 in that the timescale (9) is 
rectilinear. 
A consumer item according to any one of the claims 9 
to 15, 
characterised
 in that the timescale (9) is in 
the form of a dial (13). 
A consumer item according to claim 11, 
characterised
 
in that the display consists of flat parts or segments 

which change their reflection or absorptive capacity 
or colouring as a function of an applied electric 

voltage.  
 
A consumer item according to any one of the claims 9 
to 17, 
characterised
 in that the timer (1) is arranged 
at the top of a daily (2), more particularly near 

the date given. 
A consumer item according to any one of the claims 9 
to 18, 
characterised
 in that the timer (1) is arranged 
on a film-like carrier which simultaneously serves 

as an advertising carrier. 
A consumer item according to any one of the claims 9 
to 19, 
characterised
 in that the timer has at least 
one additional display element, whose input is connected 

with the output of a storage element which is set in turn 
by a threshold circuit when the output signal of a sensor 

element connected with the input of the threshold circuit 
goes above or below a predetermined value. 
A consumer item according to claim 20, 
characterised
 
in that the sensor element responds to temperature, 

humidity, pressure or ground forces, radiation 
and/or chemical properties of the surrounding medium, or 

the expiry of a specified period since the configuration 
of the timer.
