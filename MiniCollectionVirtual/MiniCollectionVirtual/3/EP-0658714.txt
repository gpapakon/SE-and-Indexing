<ABSTRACT>
A split mechanical seal (10), for mounting to a 
stationary housing (14) that contains a 

rotating shaft (12), including first (20) and 
second (30) seal ring assemblies, at least one resilient biasing 

element and at least one axial biasing element. The first and second seal ring assemblies each 
include a seal ring having two segments (22,32) that 

are resiliently supported in the seal. The 
segments (22,32) have an outer 

surface and a pair of segment sealing faces (21,31) disposed 
at opposite ends 

of the segments (22,32). The resilient 
biasing (200) element is concentrically disposed about and in 

intimate contact with the outer surface of one of the seal rings, for applying a first radially 
inward force that biases the sealing faces (21,31) of the 

seal ring segments (22,32) into sealing contact with 
each other. The mechanical seal (10) includes 

a pair of resilient biasing elements disposed about 
each seal ring, and the resilient biasing element (132) is 

preferably an elastomeric member. The 
axial biasing element (200) is associated with at 

least one seal ring (33) for generating and applying, in 
cooperation with the elastomeric member (132), a 

second radially inward force;the second force 
operating to bias the segment sealing faces (21,31) together 

when the mechanical seal (10) is exposed to a 
selected pressure condition. The axial biasing element (200) is 

an abutment, integrally formed with 
the segments (22,32) of both 

seal rings, that has a radially outwardly slanted outer surface. When the 
mechanical seal (10) is exposed 

to a selected pressure condition, the elastomeric member (132) is 
disposed in intimate contact with the abutment (192), and 

applies an axial force thereto. The 
abutment (192) transforms the 

axial force into an axial force component and a second radially 
inward force component. This second radially inward component also operates to bias the 

sealing faces (21,31) of the 
seal ring segments (22,32) into sealing 

contact with each other. The seal further 
includes integrally formed screw housings (80,82) that 

have formed therethrough a fastener-receiving 
aperture (84). The aperture (84) 

has a tapped smaller-diameter portion and an untapped larger diameter 
portion. The aperture (84) mounts a 

screw (90) that 
has a screw-head (96) and a shaft (92). The shaft (92) has a 

tapped larger-diameter distal end and a smaller-diameter 
proximal end. The screw (90) when 

mounted within the aperture, is positively 
maintained therein. The seal (10) further includes a 

centering mechanism. In one embodiment, the 
centering mechanism is a centering strap (240), 

seated within a transverse bore formed 
through the screw housings (80,82), that has a handle (248) and a 

pair of elongate flexible segments (250,252). In another 

embodiment, the centering mechanism is 
composed of a number of spacers (240) attached 

to an outer wall of the holder assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to mechanical seals. More particularly, the
present invention relates to universal split mechanical seals that provide strong sealing
capabilities under different operating conditions.Split mechanical seals with resiliently mounted faces are employed in a wide
variety of mechanical apparatuses to provide a pressure-tight and fluid-tight seal. The
mechanical seal is usually positioned about a rotating shaft that is mounted in and protruding
from a stationary housing. The seal is usually bolted to the housing at the shalt exit, thus
preventing the loss of pressurized process fluid from the housing.Conventional split mechanical seals include face type mechanical seals, which
include a pair of sealing rings that are concentrically disposed about the shaft, and axially
spaced from each other. The sealing rings each have sealing faces that are biased into sealing
contact with each other. Usually, one seal ring remains stationary, while the other ring
contacts the shaft and rotates therewith. The mechanical seal prevents leakage of the
pressurized process fluid to the external environment by biasing the seal ring sealing faces in
sealing contact with each other. The rotary seal ring is usually mounted in a holder assembly
which is disposed in a chamber formed by a gland assembly. The holder assembly has a pair
of holder halves, each having a pair of sealing faces, that are secured together by a number of
screws. Likewise, the gland assembly has a pair of gland halves, each having a pair of
sealing faces, that are also secured together by a number of screws. The sealing rings are
often divided into segments, each segment having a pair of sealing faces, thereby resulting in
each ring being a split ring that can be mounted about the shaft without the necessity of
freeing one end of the shaft ends.Each holder and gland half has formed on one of the sealing faces a gasket
groove for mounting a sealing gasket. When the gasket is mounted within the groove and the
halves are secured together by the screws, the gasket is placed in intimate facing contact with
the opposite sealing face of the holder or gland half. This facing contact forms a pressure-tight
and a fluid-tight seal between the respective gland and holder halves.The gland assembly is usually centered on the stationary housing prior to
securing thereto by centering the shaft and holder assembly disposed within the chamber
formed by the gland assembly, thereby determining the proper mounting position of the gland
assembly.
