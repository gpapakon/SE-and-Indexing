<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a convertible ladder assembly 
comprising a plurality of sections each providing two 
parallel stile parts joined adjacent to one end by a 
transverse rung, the assembly being collapsible such that 
of any two adjacent sections, a narrower one of the 
sections can be nested between the stile parts of the wider 
one of the sections. The two sections may in some cases be 
pivotable relatively to one another about a transverse axis 
parallel to the rungs and arranged to be fixed in a 
selected one of at least two positions in one of which the 
stile parts are mutually parallel and in another of which 
the stile parts are inclined to one another. The assembly 
can thus be modified for a number of different uses, such 
as for a ladder when the sections are mutually fixed with 
their stile parts in parallel alignment, as a step ladder 
when in an A configuration or as a workbench if end 
sections of the assembly are fixed laterally as legs from 
one or more sections forming a supporting surface. Such an assembly is disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0135666. 
However, in the construction disclosed in that 
specification any series of three adjacent sections are 
nested one within the next by pivoting the stile parts of 
one section so that the free ends of the stile parts lie 
adjacent to the rung of the next wider section. It 
necessarily follows that if the stile parts of the narrower 
inner section are to lie between the stile parts of the 
wider outer section, it cannot extend as far as the rung of 
the outer section. Consequently when the assembly is 
extended for use as a ladder, the inter-rung distance will 
successively decrease from the end of the assembly at which 
the widest section is positioned and this is an 
inconvenience. Because the sections have successively 
increasing lengths, the assembly cannot be folded to a 
symmetrical configuration, such as a level workbench. 
Furthermore, there are in practice difficulties in  
 
providing sufficiently precise pivotal connections such 
that there is an unacceptable slackness in the assembly, 
and in ensuring that the adjacent sections fold and unfold 
smoothly and without unnecessary friction. In accordance with the first aspect of the present 
invention, a convertible ladder assembly comprises a 
plurality of sections each providing two parallel stile 
parts joined adjacent to one end by a transverse rung and 
the sections being telescopically retractible each into the 
next wider section with the rung end leading until the

A collapsible ladder assembly comprising a plurality 
of sections each providing two parallel stile parts joined 

adjacent to one end by a transverse rung and the sections 
being telescopically retractible each into the next wider 

section with the rung end leading until the end transverse 
rungs of the two sections lie one immediately above the 

other in the direction of retraction and the stile parts of 
one section lie between those of the next wider section; 

the connection between the stile parts at each side of any 
two adjacent sections including complementary guide means 

which maintain parallelism between the stile parts whilst 
enabling the stile parts to slide relatively to one another 

upon extension and retraction of the adjacent sections, and 
means for fixing the stile parts of the extended sections 

at least in one position in which the stile parts are 
mutually parallel. 
A convertible ladder assembly comprising a plurality 
of sections each providing two parallel stile parts joined 

adjacent to one end by a transverse rung and the sections 
being telescopically retractible each into the next wider 

section with the rung end leading and the stile parts of 
one section lie between those of the next wider section; 

the connection between the stile parts at each side of any 
two adjacent sections including complementary guide means 

which maintain parallelism between the stile parts whilst 
enabling the stile parts to slide relatively to one another 

upon extension and retraction of the adjacent sections, 
means enabling the stile parts of the extended sections to 

pivot relatively to one another about a transverse axis 
parallel to the rungs, and means for fixing the stile parts 

of the extended sections and hence the sections in a 
selected one of at least two positions in one of which the 

stile parts are mutually parallel and in the other of which 
the stile parts are inclined to one another. 
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein the 
complementary guide means and the means enabling the stile 

parts of the extended sections to pivot relatively to one 
another comprise two guide elements sliding longitudinally 

of the stiles in a common or respective guideway, each 
guide element being attached to a different one of the 

stile parts than its guideway, whereby the guide elements 
and guideway(s) maintain parallelism between the stile 

parts when they are being extended and retracted, the 
arrangement being such that adjacent sections can be 

extended until one of the guide elements runs out of an end 
of its guideway, the other guide element then enabling the 

two stile parts to pivot relatively to one another about 
the transverse axis parallel to the rungs. 
An assembly according to claim 3, in which the guide 
elements have parallel sides which prevent them from 

rotating in the guideway(s), and the other guide element is 
pivotally connected to the stile part to which it is 

attached. 
An assembly according to claim 4, in which the or each 
guideway is of dovetail cross-section. 
An assembly according to claim 4, in which the or each 
guideway has facing convex sides, and the guide elements 

are provided with corresponding concave channels. 
An assembly according to any one of claims 3 to 6, in 
which there are two of the guide elements in a single 

guideway having at its end an abutment partially 
obstructing the guideway, and the one guide element has a 

cross-section different from that of the other guide 
element whereby it can pass the abutment whilst the other 

guide element cannot do so. 
An assembly according to any one of claims 2 to 7, in 
which the fixing means comprises at least two holes in the 

stile part of the wider section, and a laterally extensible 
locking bolt located adjacent to the rung of the narrower

one of the guide elements of the narrower stile section,
