<DESCRIPTION>
 Lubricating Oil Composition For Inhibiting Rust FormationBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention concerns the use of a synergistic combination of two rust inhibitors to inhibit rust formation in lubricating oils.2. Description of Related ArtMany lubricating oils require the presence of rust inhibi¬ tors to inhibit or prevent rust formation, which often occurs due to water contacting a metal surface. However, we have found that a synergistic combination of rust inhibitors is particularly effective in preventing rust in lubricating oils.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one embodiment, this invention concerns a lubricating oil capable of inhibiting rust formation which comprises a major amount of a lubricating oil basestock and a minor synergistic rust inhibiting amount of an additive combination comprising:(a) a rust inhibitor capable of reducing the interfacial tension between the oil and water in the oil to from about 1 to about 4 mN/m, and(b) a rust inhibitor containing a succinic acid derivative of the formula(Rl)2 - C-COOH (R2)2 - C-COOHand partially esterified alkyl succinic acid of the formula 
where Ri, 2, and R3 may be the same or different and are each an al yl group containing from about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms,wherein the weight ratio of (b) to (a) is greater than zero and less than 1:1.In another embodiment, this invention concerns a method for inhibiting rust formation in an internal combustion engine by lubricating the engine with the oil described above.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis invention requires a major amount of a lubricating oil basestock and a minor synergistic rust inhibiting amount of a combina¬ tion of two oil soluble rust inhibitors.The lubricating oil basestock can be derived from natural lubricating oils, synthetic lubricating oils, or mixtures thereof. Suitable lubricating oil basestocks also include basestocks obtained by isomerization of synthetic wax and slack wax, as well as hydro- crackate basestocks produced by hydrocracking (rather than solvent extracting) the aromatic and polar components of the crude. In general, the lubricating oil basestock will have a kinematic viscosity ranging from about 5 to about 10,000 cSt at 40°C, although typical appl cations will require an oil having a viscosity ranging from about 10 to about 1,000 cSt at 40°C.Natural lubricating oils include animal oils, vegetable oils (e.g., castor oil and lard oil), petroleum oils, mineral oils, and oils derived from coal or shale. 

 Synthetic oils include
