<ABSTRACT>
The multiplier, which is able to perform the leading low-order binary multiplication of a multiplicand coded on n bits with a multiplier coefficient, comprises processing means (14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20) which are able, for each bit of the decimal part of the multiplier coefficient situated between the low-order bit and the high-order bit, actually to calculate the sum of rank n + 1 obtained from the partial products of the said relevant bit with the n bits of the multiplicand, and from the corresponding sums calculated for the preceding bit(s) of the multiplier coefficient, so as to avoid any internal overflow of the multiplier.
