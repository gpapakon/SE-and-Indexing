<ABSTRACT>
Panel intended for the building industry, made up of an assembly of plates (10a, 10b, 10c) made of a construction material. According to the invention, the said panel includes two support elements (20a, 20b) extending parallel over the entire length of the panel, the said plates (10a, 10b, 10c) of a construction material being plates of extruded polystyrene assembled adjoining one another on the said support elements and extending as a single piece over the entire height of the panel. Application to the building industry, particularly for producing partitions or walls for revamping old premises.

<CLAIMS>
A panel for building suspended walls or dividing
partitions or for renovating premises, comprising an

assembly of sheets (10a, 10b, 10c; 10'a, 10'b, 10'c) of
a building material, said panel having two support

elements (20a, 20b; 20'a, 20'b) extending parallel across
the entire length of the panel, said sheets of building

material being mounted edge to edge on said support
elements and extending in a single block across the

entire height of the panel, characterised in that said
sheets are extruded polystyrene self-fit sheets having

male (11a, 11b; 11'a, 11'b) and female edges (12b, 12c;
12'b, 12'c) assembled edge to edge (11a, 12b, 11b, 12c)

without any intermediate connection, in order to form a
solid panel that is light, mechanically rigid and

provides heat insulation.
A panel as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that said self-fit sheets assembled edge to edge are

retained at the join thereof by fixing means (40, 40',
40") and/or stiffening means (30, 30') having a cross-section

matching the profile of the contiguous edges
(11a, 12b; 11b, 12c) of said sheets.
A panel as claimed in claim 2,characterised in
that said stiffening means (30, 30') are fixed by their

ends in anchoring points (21a, 21b; 21'a, 21'b) arranged
along said support elements.
A panel as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that said stiffening means are stiffening rods (30)

arranged between said male and female edges, said
stiffening rods (30) being sufficiently flexible to be

located in said anchoring points (21a, 21b) by means of
an elastic bending action.
A panel as claimed in claim 2, characterised in
that said stiffening means are linear stiffening elements 

(30') having:

a cross-section matching the profile of the contiguous
edges (11'a, 12'b; 11'b, 12'c) of said extruded

polystyrene sheets;
at least one tongue (34') for attaching to a support
element (20'a, 20'b);
a plurality of pins (32', 33') arranged on each face of
said linear elements (30') designed to be inserted from

said contiguous edges into the body of two adjacent
sheets (10'a, 10'b; 10'b, 10'c) between which the linear

stiffening elements are arranged.
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that said support elements (20'a, 20'b)

are hollow angled members with a P-shaped section.
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that said support elements (20'a, 20'b)

are hollow angled members with a P-shaped section.
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that it has a means (40, 40', 40") for

fixing to a bearing element (50) having a foot (41, 41',
41") which is fixed to said bearing element and at least

one tapered tooth (42a, 42b, 43a, 43b; 48a, 48b, 49)
designed to be inserted from an edge (12a) into the body

of an end-sheet (10a) of said panel.
A panel as claimed in claim 8, characterised in
that said fixing means has at least two tapered teeth

linked by a jointing plate (44) designed to co-operate
with the section of an edge (12'a) of said end-sheet

(10'a) once said tapered teeth are inserted.
A panel as claimed in claim 9, characterised in
that said jointing plate (44) also has at least two other

tapered teeth (48a, 48b, 49) opposite said tapered teeth.
A panel as claimed in one of claims 3 or 4 and
one of claims 9 or 10, characterised in that said

jointing plate (44) bears a retaining clip (45) for said 
stiffening rods (30).
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 11,
characterised in that said fixing foot (41', 41") has an

edge (41'a, 41"a) folded back by 90°.
A panel as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 11,
characterised in that said fixing foot (41', 41") has at

least one tongue (49) which can be folded by 90° and has
an orifice (50) through which a suspension rod (60) is

inserted.
A panel as claimed in one of claims 12 and 13,
characterised in that said folded-back edge (41'a, 41"a)

also has an orifice (51) through which said suspension
rod (60) is inserted.
A panel as claimed in one of claims 13 or 14,
characterised in that the fixing means has an expansion

joint (70) comprising a plate (71) for fixing to the
bearing element (50), terminating at one end with an endpiece

(72) designed to be inserted in a cut-out section
(52) of a fold-out tongue (49) of the fixing foot (41')

so as to maintain said fixing means (40') suspended.
A panel as claimed in claim 15, characterised in
that said fixing plate (71) has a lap (76) having

orifices (73, 74) through which the suspension rod (60)
are inserted.
