<ABSTRACT>
Cylinder liner support arrangement in an internal combustion 
engine in which the cylinder block (14) and cylinder head (16) 

are preferably integrated in a common monobloc element (12) and 
the cylinder barrels for the engine pistons consist of cylinder 

liners (24) which have their upper portions (24') inserted in 
cylinder bores (26) in the cylinder block (14). The lower 

portions (24'') of the cylinder liners (24) are accommodated in 
cylindrical apertures (8) in a common cylinder liner support 

(2) which is made as a single element and is removably secured 
to a lower surface (28) of the cylinder block. The cylinder 

liner support (2) includes a number (corresponding to the 
number of cylinders of the engine) of mutually connected 

supporting sleeves (6) which are disposed in line, delineate 
the cylindrical apertures (8) and have their sleeve walls 

surrounding the lower portions (24'') of the cylinder liners and 
providing them with lateral support. The cylinder liner 

support includes a mounting plate (4) from one side of which 
the supporting sleeves (6) protrude. Along the side edges of 

the mounting plate (4) there are fastening holes (10) to 
accommodate screws for screwing the cylinder liner support (2) 

firmly to the lower surface of the cylinder block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a cylinder liner support 
arrangement of the kind indicated in the introduction to 
claim 1. Such an arrangement serving as cylinder liner support is 
particularly intended for use in internal combustion engines in 
which the cylinder block (engine block) and associated cylinder 
head are made in a single continuous piece, commonly called a 
monobloc element or simply a monobloc. In such an engine, the 
cylinder liners (which form cylinder barrels for the pistons) 
have their upper portions inserted in cavities (cylinder bores) 
in the cylinder block. The cylinder liner support may 
nevertheless also be used in internal combustion engines in 
which the cylinder block is separate from the cylinder head, in 
which case the cylinder liner support is separate from the 
crankshaft portion of the engine. In a conventional internal combustion engine in which the 
cylinder block (engine block) and cylinder head (top cap) are 
separate elements, the cylinder head is fastened on top of the 
cylinder block by means of studbolts or other types of 
fastening screws. The valve seat machining required for such a 
conventional engine involves no great difficulties, since in 
this case the valve seats are situated in the "roof" of the 
combustion chamber, i.e. on the underside of the cylinder head. 
This makes the valve seats readily accessible for machining 
from the underside of the cylinder head. In the contrasting case of internal combustion engines of the 
kind indicated in the introduction, i.e. monobloc engines in 
which the cylinder head and cylinder block consist of a single 
undivided constructional element, valve seat machining 
involves great difficulties. This is because in this case the 
valve seats are situated deep inside the monobloc, more 
precisely in the roof of the combustion chamber, i.e. at the 
top of the respective cylinders. The valve seats are thus  
 
situated just above the extreme top ends of the cylinders, i.e. 
just above the extreme top ends of the cylinder bores which are 
incorporated in the monobloc and in which the cylinder liners 
have to be fastened. Machining the valve seats in this case has to be done by means 
of tools introduced into the monobloc from below, more 
precisely up through the cylinders/cylinder bores in the 
monobloc. As machining the valve seats in such an engine does 
of course take place before the cylinder liners have been 
fitted in the cylinder bores, the "working distance" through a 
cylinder bore is not as great as the axial

Cylinder liner support arrangement in an internal combustion 
engine with at least two cylinder-shaped combustion chambers 

disposed in line in a cylinder block (14), in which the 
combustion chambers are lined with cylinder liners (24) which 

have their upper portions (24') inserted in cavities (26) in 
the 
cylinder block (14) which are delineated upwards by a 
cylinder head (16), and a crankcase portion (50) accommodating 

a crankshaft is connected to the lower portion of the cylinder 
block (14), 
characterised
 in that the lower 
portions (24'') of each cylinder liner(24) for at least two 

combustion chambers disposed in line are accommodated in 
cylindrical apertures (8) in a common cylinder liner support(2) 

which takes the form of a single combined element separate from 
the engine crankcase portion (50), which liner support is 

removably fastened to a lower surface (28) of the cylinder 
block (14) and contains supporting sleeves (6) which are 

mutually connected (44), and are delineated by the cylindrical 
apertures (8) and have their sleeve walls surrounding the lower 

portions (24'') of the cylinder liners providing them with 
lateral support. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that the lower portions (24'') of the cylinder liners (24) 

are accommodated in cylindrical apertures (8) in a common 
cylinder liner support (2) which is made as a single element 

and contains a number of mutually connected (44) supporting 
sleeves (6) disposed in line which corresponds to the number of 

cylinders of the engine. 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised
 in that the cylinder block (14) and 
associated cylinder head (16) of the internal combustion engine 

form part of one and the same monobloc element(12) and that the 
cylinder block (14) is connected to the crankcase portion (50) 

via anchoring devices (18, 22) which are situated radially 
around the outside of the cylinder liner support (2).  

 
Arrangement according to claim 3, whereby variation of the 
compression of the engine is made possible by the monobloc 

element (12) being tiltably mounted on the engine crankcase 
portion (50) (which accommodates the crankshaft) by means of a 

hinge pin mounting (20, 22) on one side of the cylinder block

supporting sleeves there are fastening holes (10) through the 
edges of the mounting plate (4) to accommodate screws (30) for

support (2) firmly to the lower surface (28) of the cylinder 

block (14).

where a pair of mutually adjacent supporting sleeves (6) are

Arrangement according to any one of the foregoing claims,
