<ABSTRACT>
A packet switching communication system is improved by 
using a packet header structure which does not require a 

fixed format. 
The packet header comprises a chain of 2 byte command/data 
segments. Each command/data segment contains generic bits 

and a routing field. One of the generic bits (bit 1) allows 
the header to be extended with another command/data 

segment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telecommunication networks and
more particularly to an improved network layer packet
structure for a fast packet switching network.In a digital transmission network, data from a large number
of users are serially transmitted from one network
node to another network node, up to their respective final
destination. Due to the evolution of networks towards more
and more complex mixing of sub-networks with heterogeneous
architectures, it is clear that there is a future requirement
to support distributed computing applications across
high speed backbones that may be carrying LAN traffic,
voice, video and traffic among channel-attached hosts and
workstations. Perhaps the fundamental challenge for high
speed networking is to minimize the processing time within
each node in the network.Packet switching is now commonly used to accommodate the
bursty, multiprocess communication found in distributed
computing environments. Packets are pieces of data produced
by an originating user, which are prefixed with
headers containing routing information that identifies the
originating and destination users. Small computers, called
packet switches or nodes are linked to form a network.
Some of these nodes are called end nodes and provide user
access to the network. Adapters circuit at each of the 
switching nodes adapt the packet signals for transmission
or delivery to the transmission links and user applications,
respectively. Each node examines each header and
decides where to send the packet to move it closer to its
final destination.Routing protocols or methods are used to control the routing
of the packets from node to node through the transmission
system. Automatic Network Routing (ANR) uses a concatenation
of linked labels or identifiers for the successive
legs of the packet switching route. Labels are
stripped away as the packets traverses the network, always
leaving the next required label at the head of the routing
field. Tree_Routing is defined as a connected set of network
nodes and links. In such a tree, a unique tree address
is used in the routing field of the packet header
and the same tree address is associated with every link
forming the tree. When a multicast packet reaches a packet
switching node, the tree address in the packet is compared
to the tree address associated with all outgoing links
from the node. The packet then may be propagated from the
node to one or a plurality of links for which an address
match occurs. Label Swapping uses a routing field which
includes a label

the control bit found in the first command and data segment

encountered having a disable indicator having a predetermined second
value.
