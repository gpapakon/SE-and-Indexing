battery separator and a process for making the same. A first 

microporous membrane with shutdown capability and a second 
microporous membrane with strength capability are joined 

together in face-to-face contact. The face of the first membrane

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a shutdown, bilayer
battery separator.Shutdown, bilayer battery separators are known. For
example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,650,730; 4,731,304; 5,240,655;
5,281,491; and Japanese Kokai No. 6-20671.In batteries, the anode and cathode are separated from one
another by a separator. Today, "lithium batteries" are very
popular because they are able to generate high energy outputs.
The lithium battery market can be divided into two groups, the
"primary" lithium battery and the "secondary" lithium battery.
The primary lithium battery is a disposable battery, while the
secondary lithium battery is a rechargeable battery. A problem
associated with the secondary lithium battery is its potential 
for short circuiting. Short circuiting arises when the separator
ruptures and allows the anode and the cathode to come into direct
electrical communication with one another. This short circuit
may manifest itself with a rapid evolution of heat. This rapid
evolution of heat can cause the battery to explode. Accordingly,
the shutdown battery separator was developed.The shutdown battery separator generally comprises two
polymerically dissimilar and juxtaposed microporous membranes.
One microporous membrane is chosen for its relatively low melting
point and the other for its relative strength. For example, the
low melting point membrane may be a polyethylene material and the
strength membrane may be a polypropylene material. The
polyethylene microporous membrane has a melting point of about
130°C. This is sufficiently low that, in the event of a short
circuit in a lithium battery, the heat generated will melt the
polyethylene so that it shuts down, or fills in the pores of the
separator, and thereby stops or inhibits the likelihood of a
short circuit. The polypropylene membrane, which has a
substantially higher melting point, approximately 160°C, provides
strength to the separator so that it maintains the separator's
integrity in the event of a short circuit.In U.S. Patent No. 4,650,730 and 4,731,304, shutdown,
bilayer battery separators of the foregoing type are disclosed.
In the examples, separator thicknesses of 76-102 µm (3-4 mils)
are disclosed. 
The methods of making these battery separators are disclosed as:
1) two discrete films containing extractable fillers are made,
then bonded together, and then the fillers are extracted; 2) a
bilayer film, containing extractable fillers, is coextruded and
the fillers are subsequently extracted; 3) one film made by an
extrusion, annealing and
