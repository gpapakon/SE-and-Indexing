<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for coating with maltitol enabling a coating to be created easily and quickly on the surface of the product. This process consists, on the one hand in applying a carbohydrate syrup, a protein syrup or steam, and on the other hand in applying, in pulverulent form, an amount of maltitol-containing powder having a purity of greater than 87%.

Process for coating with maltitol making it
possible to create a coating on the surface of a product,

comprising besides the application of a carbohydrate syrup,
of a protein syrup or of steam, the application in

pulverulent form of a quantity of maltitol powder,
characterized in that the maltitol has a purity higher than

87%.
Coating process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the quantity of maltitol powder represents

at least 5%, preferably 15% and still more preferably
from 20 to 99.5% of the coating for products

intended for marketing.
Coating process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the maltitol powder applied has a purity

higher than 90%, preferably higher than 95% and more
preferably higher than 98%.
Coating process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the product to be coated is an alimentary

product, a product for animals, a pharmaceutical or
veterinary product, a dietetic product, a seed or a

grain, a fertilizer powder or else an additive based on
enzymes, microorganisms, vitamins, flavours, perfumes,

acids, sweeteners or active principles.
Coating process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that a carbohydrate syrup containing less than

85% of maltitol in relation to its soluble dry matter
content is applied; this carbohydrate syrup being

preferably a syrup containing from 10 to 75% of maltitol
or a syrup of low-calorie saccharides such as the

alcohol-sugars other than maltitol, polydextroses,
oligofructoses, dextrins, cellulose-based substances, gum

arabic and pectins.
Coating process according to Claim 5, characterized
in that it makes it possible to obtain a hard and

vitreous coating preferably containing from 60 to 95% of
maltitol, and in that it consists of a gumming.
Coating process according to Claim 5, characterized
in that it makes it possible to obtain a soft 

coating preferably containing from 20 to 95% of maltitol,
and in that it consists of a soft coating operation,

optionally preceded by a gumming.
Coating process according to Claim 1 or 5,
characterized in that it makes it possible to prepare a

coating formed by a plurality of microcrystals and
composed of 95 to 99.5% of maltitol, and in that it

consists of a sanding operation, optionally preceded by
a gumming.
Coating process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that a carbohydrate syrup containing more than

85% of maltitol in relation to its soluble dry matter
content is applied, this carbohydrate syrup being

preferably prepared by dissolving a maltitol powder which
has a purity higher than 87%.
Coating process according to Claim 9, characterized
in that it makes it possible to prepare a hard

and crunchy coating preferably containing from 95 to
99.5% of maltitol, and in that it consists of a frosting,

a hard coating or a smoothing operation, optionally
preceded by a gumming.
Surface coating intended to protect or embellish
a product, consisting of at least 5%, preferably of at

least 15% and more preferably from 20 to 99.5% of
maltitol powder which has a purity higher than 87%,

preferably higher than 90% and still more preferably
higher than 95%.
