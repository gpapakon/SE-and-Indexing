<ABSTRACT>
Acemannan has been shown to be effective in treating a number of conditions where the principal mechanism of resolution or cure requires intervention by the patient's immune system. Acemannan has direct stimulatory effects on the immune system. Methods for treating cancer, viral diseases, respiratory and immune regulatory diseases, inflammations, infections and infestations by administering an acetylated mannan derivative, such as acemannan derived from aloe, are described. The method finds use in tissue cultures, animals and plants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the use of acetylated mannans for the manufacture of a medicament to regulate
blood cholesterol levels or to remove plaques formed in blood vessels of an animal.Aloe is a member of the lily family. Aloe vera contains
two major liquid sources, a yellow latex (exudate) and the clear
gel (mucilage). The dried exudate of Aloebarbadensis Miller 
leaves is referred to as aloe. The commercial name is Curacao
aloe. It is composed mainly of aloin, aloe-emodin and phenols.

Pharmazie, 315:477-478 (1982). A number of phenolics,
including anthraquinones and their glycosides, are known to be
pharmaceutically active. Bruce, Excelsa, 5:57-68 (1975); Suga et
al., Cosmetics and Toiletries, 98:105-108 (1983).The mucilaginous jelly from the parenchymal cells of the
plant is referred to as Aloe vera gel. There are generally no
anthraquinones to decompose and cause discoloration of the gel
unless the gel is contaminated by an improper processing
technique. Aloe vera gel is about 98.5% water by weight. More
than 60% of the total solid is made up of polysaccharides of
carbohydrate origin. Organic acids and inorganic compounds,
especially calcium oxalate, account for the remainder of the
solid.Aloe vera was the traditional medicine of many cultures
as an anthelmintic, cathartic and stomachic and was used inter
alia for leprosy, burns and allergic conditions. Cole et al.,

conditions. Mackee, X-rays and Radium in the Treatment of
