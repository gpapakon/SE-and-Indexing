<ABSTRACT>
A passive element 33 for transducing a circularly-polarized 
wave into a linearly-polarized wave is disposed in 

a conical horn 11, and a short-circuit plate 2 is disposed 
by being spaced out by a prescribed distance from the 

passive element 33. The short-circuit plate 2 is disposed 
on the attachment wall surface 55 between the conical horn 

11 and a rectangular waveguide 12, and it has the formation 
of a slit. The slit extracts only a linearly-polarized wave 

component, which is propagated to the rectangular waveguide 
12. A probe 53 is inserted in the rectangular waveguide 12, 

and the BS signal received by the probe 53 is transduced 
into an intermediate frequency signal by a frequency 

transducer arranged on a RF circuit board 54.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circular-to-linear 
polarized wave transducer for transducing a 
circularly-polarized wave into a linearly-polarized wave, 
and particularly to a polarized-wave transducer applied 
suitably to the primary horn of a BS antenna. Broadcasts based on a broadcasting satellite (BS) 
and communication satellite (CS) are prevailing recently. These broadcasts are received by using a BS antenna 
or CS antenna. The BS-based broadcast is transmitted from 
the satellite in the form of a radio wave that is 
circularly-polarized, and therefore it is necessary for the 
primary horn of the receiving BS antenna to be equipped with 
a transducer which transduces the circularly-polarized wave 
into a linearly-polarized wave. Fig. 13 shows an example of the BS antenna. In Fig. 13, reference numeral 1⊘⊘ denotes a 
paraboloid reflector which reflects the radio wave that is 
circularly polarized. Disposed at the focal point of the 
paraboloid reflector 1⊘⊘ is a primary horn 1⊘1, by which the 
radio wave focused by the paraboloid reflector 1⊘⊘ is taken 
in. The primary horn 1⊘1 is generally made up of a conical 
horn for receiving a circularly-polarized wave, a circular-to-linear  
 
polarized wave transducer for transducing the 
circularly-polarized wave received by the conical horn into 
a linearly-polarized wave, a rectangular waveguide connected 
to the transducer, a probe inserted in the rectangular 
waveguide, and a frequency transducer for transducing the BS 
signal received by the probe into an intermediate frequency 
signal. The primary horn 1⊘1 is disposed at the focal point 
of the paraboloid reflector 1⊘⊘ by being supported by a stay 
1⊘2, and the complete BS antenna is installed on the 
balcony, roof or the like of a building by being supported 
swingably by a mast 1⊘3. Fig. 14 shows an example of the conventional primary 
horn used for the BS antenna. In Fig. 14, the circularly-polarized BS signal 
received by the conical horn 111 is propagated in the 
conical horn 111 and entered to a circular-to-linear 
polarized wave transducer 112. The transducer 112 
incorporates a phase shift plate of dielectric material 
disposed at a 45°-inclination for example, by which the 
circularly-polarized wave is transduced into a linearly-polarized 
wave. The resulting linearly-polarized wave is 
propagated in the rectangular waveguide formed in a housing 
113 through flanges 116 and 117, and the BS signal is 
transduced into an intermediate frequency (IF) signal by a  
 
frequency transducer
