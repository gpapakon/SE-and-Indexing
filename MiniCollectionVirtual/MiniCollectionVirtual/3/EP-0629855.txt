<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a variable force support device 
for supporting an in-line pipe inspection tool during 
longitudinal travel of the tool through a pipe being 
inspected. It is known to perform in-line inspection of pipe by 
magnetic flux leakage technology. With these inspection 
practices, an in-line pipe inspection tool is propelled 
through the pipeline by the flowing product therein, which 
for example may be oil. As the tool passes through the 
pipeline, a strong magnetic field is induced into the pipe 
wall. Defects in the form of discontinuities will cause 
redistribution of the magnetic flux around the defect. This 
results in some of the lines of magnetic flux leaking out 
into the surrounding medium. The inspection tool embodies an 
electromagnet which is battery powered to power an 
electromagnet that induces the magnetic flux field into the 
pipe wall. Two sets of steel brushes are used in conjunction 
with the electromagnet to constitute the magnetic north and 
south poles of the magnetic flux field. It is necessary to 
maintain constant contact between the two sets of brushes and 
the internal surface of the pipe to ensure an uninterrupted 
magnetic flux field within the pipe wall. This is difficult 
to achieve if a single inspection device is used with pipe of 
different diameters. A plurality of transducers are used to  
 
detect magnetic flux leakage indicating a defect in the pipe 
wall. The transducers provide a signal indicating the 
presence of a defect, which signal may be processed by 
various electronic recording arrangements. The two sets of steel brushes employed with the 
magnetizer act to support the inspection tool during its 
travel through the pipe. After extended use of the 
inspection tool, these steel brushes tend to wear and deform 
as a result of the combination of the weight of the 
inspection tool being supported, the weight of the fluid in 
the pipe above the inspection tool and contact with the 
interior surfaces of the pipe. This results in misposition 
of the inspection tool during travel through the pipe and 
discontinuous contact between the steel brushes and the 
interior pipe wall surface. This adversely affects the 
desired uninterrupted magnetic flux field in the pipe wall 
necessary for effective defect detection. This condition is 
exacerbated when the tool is used with pipes of different 
diameters. With these applications the brushes are required 
to extend sufficiently to support the tool with increased 
diameter pipe and then compress when
