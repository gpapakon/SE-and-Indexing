<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing an active composite, comprising the stages of       - formation of a porous support,   - formation of at least one cavity in the porous support, - introduction into the porous support of an active agent brought into the cavity.   The active composite produced by this process can be employed in chemical heat pumps.

<CLAIMS>
Method for production of an active compound 
comprising the steps of: 


formation of at least two porous supports by 
recompression of an expanded powdered product; 
formation of at least one cavity which extends in 
each porous support; 
formation of an assembly with the supports, the 
cavities of each support being disposed inside the 

assembly; and 
distribution in the mass of the porous supports 
of an active agent, from the cavities. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that in order to form the cavity, each support is 

formed with a partial recess, the supports being 
disposed such that two partial recesses correspond and 

together form the cavity. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the assembly of supports is formed from a 

series of porous supports which are substantially the 
same as one another. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the active agent is introduced 

in the porous support by inserting the active agent in  
 

the cavity and dispersing the active agent in the 
support by injection of steam in the cavity. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that in order to introduce the active 
agent in the porous support, a solution of the active 

agent is prepared and this solution is then injected 
in the cavity, the method additionally comprising a 

step of drying the impregnated porous support. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that in order to introduce the active 

agent in the porous support, a solution of the active 
agent is prepared and inserted in the cavity, and 

additionally the steps are performed of spinning of 
the porous support in order to make the solution 

penetrate in the porous support, and drying of the 
impregnated porous support. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that in order to introduce the active 

agent in the porous support, there is introduced in 
the cavity a mixture of an active agent and a 

sublimable dispersant, the dispersant being intended 
to make the active agent penetrate in the porous 

support under the effect of heat.  
 
Active compound consisting of a compressed 
support and an agent which is active in relation to a 

gas produced according to the method of one of claims 
1 to 7. 
Active compound according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the compressed support comprises 

recompressed expanded graphite with a density of 
between 0.02 and 1.5, and comprises 1 to 95% by weight 

of recompressed expanded graphite and 99 to 5% by 
weight of expanded agent.
