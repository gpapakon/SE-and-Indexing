<ABSTRACT>
A method of cladding an outer tube (1) with an inner tube (2), wherein the inner tube is made of a corrosion-resistant material, for instance. The invention is characterized by placing a number of explosive charges (3) in mutually spaced arrangement in the inner tube (2), in contact with or essentially in contact with the inner surface of the inner tube; filling the inner tube with a pressure-transmitting medium (4), preferably water; and detonating all explosive charges (3) simultaneously, so as to obtain a local metallurgical bond (6) at the regions of the explosive charges and so as to cause the inner tube (2) to expand into abutment with the outer tube (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of cladding 
an outer tube with an inner tube by detonating explosive 
charges. It is known to expand a corrosion-resistant inner tube 
into contact with an outer, mechanically strong tube 
by means of an explosion process, so as to obtain a 
mechanical pressure joint between the two tubes. It is 
also known to bind the two tubes metallurgically over 
the whole of their contacting surfaces by means of an 
explosion-welding process, see for instance US-A-3863327, wherein 
explosive charges are set up in a liquid along the central axis of the 
pipes, and simultaneously fired. In the case of the mechanical pressure joint, one 
drawback is that in the case of large diameters and 
thin cladding tubes, there is a risk that the latter 
tube will become inwardly distorted should a vacuum be 
generated in the conduit. In the case of the metallurgical joint, the risk of 
inwardly distorsion does not exist, since a joint of 
this nature has a high mechanical strength, even 
against radially and inwardly acting stresses. An explosion-welding process, however, is expensive, 
particularly in the case of large diameters, which 
require very large quantities of explosives and supportive 
fixtures. In practice, explosion-welding processes 
are restricted to tube lengths of 4-5 metres. These drawbacks are avoided with the inventive method, 
both with solely mechanical joints and also with 
explosion welds effected over the entire surface of 
the tubes. Thus, the present invention relates to a method of 
cladding an outer tube with an inner tube in which the 
inner tube is made, for instance, of a corrosion-resistant  
 
material. The inventive method comprises: 
placing a number of explosive charges 
in the inner tube in contact with or essentially in 
contact with the inner surface of the tube, said 
explosive charges being spaced from one another and 
distributed over the inner surface of said inner tube; 
filling the inner tube with a pressure-transmitting 
medium, preferably water; and detonating all explosive 
charges simultaneously, such as to cause a local 
metallurgical joint in the vicinity of respective 
explosive charges and expansion of the inner tube into 
abutment with the outer tube. The invention will now be described in more detail 
with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof 
and also with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which 
Figures 1 and 2 are respectively radial and axial section 
views of an outer and an inner tube with 
explosive

A method of cladding an outer tube (1) with an 
inner tube (2), wherein the inner tube is comprised of 

a corrosion-resistant material for instance, 
comprising : placing a number of explosive
