<ABSTRACT>
A hydrodynamic pump is formed coaxially with respect to a 
hydrodynamic bearing. The integrated bearing and pump assembly can 

provide pressurized fluid for various uses within the device 
incorporating the bearing. In the hydrodynamic bearing assembly a 

secondary hydrodynamic bearing is incorporated into the primary bearing 
assembly. The secondary bearing is optimized for high flow pumping 

applications rather than the high pressure, zero flow requirements of the 
primary bearing. When the bearing assembly is rotated, fluid flow is 

provided. The assembly includes a first cylinder 124, a second cylinder 
102 coaxially within the first cylinder, and a shaft 110 coaxially within 

the second cylinder. The shaft and first cylinder are attached to rotate 
together. Grooves 306, 352 on the outer surface of the shaft and second 

cylinder form the primary and seconday bearing respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention relates generally to pumps that utilize 
hydrodynamic bearings to pressurize a fluid, such as are incorporated 
into the spindle assembly of a magnetic recording disk drive. A traditional mechanical bearing uses a liquid lubricant in 
combination with ball bearings to reduce the frictional wear of a 
rotating shaft. However, when used in high precision, high RPM 
applications, traditional mechanical bearings have several shortcomings. 
Ball bearings are not perfectly spherical and the race within which they 
sit can deform slightly. This can cause random fluctuations in the 
orientation and position of the rotating shaft. Furthermore, mechanical 
bearings often wear in ways that increase the magnitude of these random 
displacements. In addition, wear particles and lubricant can spread from 
the mechanical bearing and contaminate the device incorporating the 
rotating shaft. Because of the above difficulties, a gas bearing is often the 
preferred way of supporting a rapidly rotating shaft for some 
applications. Gas bearings may use either hydrostatic or hydrodynamic 
principles of operation. In a hydrostatic bearing a source of 
pressurized gas is supplied between a rotating shaft and its surrounding 
sleeve. The gas acts as a lubricant and allows the shaft to rotate 
without coming into contact with the sleeve. In a hydrodynamic bearing, 
oblique grooves are cut in a shaft and the rotation of the shaft causes 
gas to flow through the grooves. The dynamic pressure created by this 
gas flow allows the gas to act as a lubricant. In many applications, the 
lubricant gas used is simply filtered air. For other applications, noble 
gases or nitrogen may be preferred because of their relative inertness. One field of application of hydrodynamic bearings is in disk 
drives, which incorporate rapidly rotating shafts to spin magnetic 
recording media below read/write heads. Higher rotation speeds are 
desirable since they result in faster access to data. However, rotation 
rates above 10,000 RPM are not practical with mechanical bearings. In 
addition, the random fluctuations of a mechanical bearing reduce the 
accuracy with which a read/write head can be positioned with respect to 
the rotating disk. This in turn limits the recording densities that can  
 
be achieved. Therefore, some magnetic recording disks are supported by 
an air bearing spindle which consists of a hydrodynamic journal bearing 
to support radial loads and a hydrodynamic thrust bearing to support 
axial loads. The
