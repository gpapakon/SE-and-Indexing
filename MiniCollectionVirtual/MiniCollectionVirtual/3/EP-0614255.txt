<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a laser, to be referred to as a "Z-laser", which comprises 
means (17,18,19) that can ensure excitation of a laser mode that has a far field 

pattern that comes substantially to a focus at a point external to the laser. Typically, 
a Z-laser is a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) that comprises an 

appropriately patterned top surface. Exemplarily, appropriately spaced circular 
concentric features, such as trenches (17,18,19), are formed in the surface. Lasers 

according to the invention can be advantageously used in variety of applications, 
e.g., as pump lasers in an optically amplified optical fiber communication system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to articles (e.g., an optical data processing 
system or an optical fiber communication system) that comprise a semiconductor 
laser, specifically a vertical cavity surface emitting semiconductor laser (VCSEL), and 
means for producing a focused radiation output of the laser. VCSELs have recently generated considerable interest, due to their 
potential for high output power and spatial coherence. See, for instance, R. A. 
Morgan et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 61, p. 1160 (1992). The spatial 
coherence typically is required for applications that involve beam focusing (e.g., 
pump laser for a fiber amplifier) and/or beam steering. Beam focusing is a frequently present feature of articles that comprise a 
semiconductor laser which, up to now, has required provision of an appropriate 
separate focusing element, typically a lens. This is an obvious disadvantage, 
entailing additional cost and complexity, including an alignment step. Thus, it 
would be desirable to have available a semiconductor laser having a focused output. 
This application discloses such a laser, to be referred to as a "zone" laser or "Z-laser". FIGS. 1 and 2 schematically depict an exemplary VCSEL according to 
the invention, a Z-laser; FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 respectively show the near field pattern, far field 
pattern and output spectrum of an exemplary Z-laser; and FIG. 6 shows schematically an exemplary article according to the 
invention, namely, an optical fiber communication system that comprises a Z-laser. 
No attempt has been made to accurately display dimensions and/or proportions. The invention is as defined by the claims. Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 13, no. 168 (E-747) 21 April 1989 & JP-A-64-001290, as well as optics Letters, vol. 16, no. 12, 15 June 1991, p. 919-921, both describe articles according to the preamble of claim 1. In a broad aspect the 
invention is embodied in an article that comprises a laser, the laser comprising 
integral means that cause the laser to have a radiation output that substantially comes 
to a focus at a point external to the laser. The output beam of a laser "comes substantially to a focus" herein if the 
output beam is a converging beam, with a minimum cross section at some distance 
(the focal distance) from the laser.  
 More specifically, the laser comprises a semiconductor layer structure 
that comprises first and second reflection means and an active region between said 
first and second reflection means. The laser further comprises contact means that 
facilitate
