for a predetermined beverage, especially a single serving of the 
beverage, upon the actuation of the selector (1), 
characterized 
in that
 the controlling means monitors the selector (1) a 
predetermined amount of time after its actuation and prolongs 

the started preparation cycle upon a renewed actuation of the 
selector within the predetermined amount of time for preparing 

a beverage with modified parameters, especially an enlarged

 the predetermined amount of time is 1 to 2 s. 
Controlling means according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 the enlarged amount of beverage corresponds 
to double the single serving of the beverage. 
Controlling means according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 upon the first actuation of the selector 
(1) the parameters assigned to the single serving of the beverage 

are loaded into a working memory (11), which is superseded 
by the parameters of the enlarged amount of beverage upon the 

renewed actuation of the selector in the predetermined amount of 
time, and in that the started preparation cycle is continued 

with the new parameters.  
 
Controlling means according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
