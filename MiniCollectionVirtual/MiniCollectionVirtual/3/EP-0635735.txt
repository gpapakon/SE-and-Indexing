<ABSTRACT>
Lithium niobate waveguides for light and lithium niobate 
channel waveguide electro-optic phase modulators for light 

include sufficient lithium ions such that, when an electrical 
signal of known value is applied to such waveguides and 

modulators, the phase of light passing through the waveguide or 
the modulator changes to a desired value within a time period 

that is substantially instantaneous.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lithium niobate optical 
waveguides and to channel waveguide electro-optic phase 
modulators. Before now, the amplitude of light waves passing through 
lithium niobate optical waveguides, such as the waveguides used 
in fibre-optic gyros (FOG's), has failed to change substantially 
instantaneously to a desired value upon application of an 
electrical signal to the waveguide. Instead, the amplitudes of 
such light waves has tended to change gradually, requiring time 
periods of a few hundred microseconds or more to attain and 
maintain the desired value. This gradual change of amplitude is 
sometimes called phase relaxation, and seriously degrades the 
performance of FOG's containing them. A need exists for methods for making optical waveguides and 
for making channel waveguide electro-optic phase modulators that 
exhibit substantially no phase relaxation and that can therefore 
improve the performance of FOG's containing them by at least one 
order of magnitude. This invention relates to lithium niobate optical 
waveguides, and to lithium niobate channel waveguide electro-optic 
phase modulators which contain sufficient lithium ions such  
 
that the phase of a light signal passing through the waveguide or 
modulator changes substantially instantaneously to a desired 
value when a known electrical signal, such as a step function 
electrical signal, is applied to the modulator or waveguide. 
More particularly, the quantity of lithium ions in the waveguide 
or modulator is preferably sufficient to cause the phase of a 
light signal passing through the waveguide or phase modulator to 
change to a desired, steady-state value in not more than about 
one microsecond. Waveguides or modulators according to the invention 
include sufficient lithium ions such that, when 
an electrical signal is applied to such a waveguide or modulator, 
the amplitude of light passing through the waveguide or modulator 
changes to a desired value substantially within the transient 
time of the applied electrical signal. This invention also 
relates to methods of making such optical waveguides and such 
channel waveguide electro-optic phase modulators. One method for making these waveguides and phase modulators 
comprises subjecting a lithium niobate waveguide, before the 
waveguide undergoes proton exchange and thermal annealing, to 
heat treatment in the presence of oxygen. This heat treatment 
preferably takes place at a temperature in the range of about 
400°C to about 1000°C, at about atmospheric
