<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for 
purification of a polymer comprising passing a gas through 

a dry mass of the powdered polymer, characterized in that 
the mass of the powdered polymer is located on a body that 

is permeable to the gas and impermeable to the powdered 
polymer particles, a higher gas pressure being maintained 

on the side of the body where the mass of the powdered 
polymer is present than on the other side of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for 
purification of a polymer comprising passing a gas through 
a dry mass of the powdered polymer. After being polymerized, such a polymer, which 
may be formed by, for instance, emulsion polymerization or 
solution polymerization, contains one or more low-molecular-weight 
impurities such as residual monomer or a 
low-boiling solvent. These low-molecular-weight impurities 
may, during processing or when the polymer is used in an 
article, for instance, diffuse from the polymer and enter 
the environment. Many impurities are toxic or carcinogenic 
or have some other undesirable effect on the environment. 
Thus, it is most important to reduce the amount of 
impurity in the polymer as much as possible. This applies 
to, for instance, polymers or copolymers that are applied 
in the foodstuff industry as, for instance, packaging 
material.
 
In many polymerization processes the polymer is either 
brought into powder form during or after the 
polymerization process or is already in powder form 
because of the nature of the polymerization process 
proper. Powder form is understood to mean a mass of 
particles with a weight average particle size of from 0.03 
mm to about 1 mm. The polymer particles may have pores as 
in the case of, for instance, polymer crumb obtained after 
coagulation of a latex.
 
The impurity then resides in the matrix of the polymer, of 
which the powder particles of the powdered polymer are 
made up. The impurity is difficult to remove from this 
matrix.
 
 
In some cases, after polymerizing, the polymer mass may in 
addition contain an amount of liquid used as an auxiliary 
agent in the polymerization process. This is the case 
with, for instance, polymers obtained in an emulsion 
polymerization process in which water is used. This amount 
of liquid is removed in a simple manner ahead of the 
purification step of the present invention by, for 
instance, centrifuging or by using a fluidized bed. The 
amount of liquid is readily removed, since the liquid is 
located between the powder particles of the powdered 
polymer, not in the matrix of the polymer of which the 
powder particles of the powdered polymer are made up. 
Accordingly, dry polymer mass in powder form is understood 
to mean such a mass having a liquid content of less than 2 
per cent by weight relative to the total weight of the 
polymer mass in powder form. A purification process for a polymer comprising 
passing a gas through a mass of the powdered polymer is 
disclosed in GB-A-1507338.
