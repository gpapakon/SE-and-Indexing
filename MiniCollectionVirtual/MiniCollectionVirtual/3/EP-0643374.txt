<ABSTRACT>
An electronic franking system for postal items 
for franking the postal item correctly, without the 

intervention of postal administration staff. The system 31 
is of the "self service" type, and comprises a cabinet 32 

which houses an electronic unit 33, a keyboard 34, a 
screen 36, a compartment 64 for receiving the postal items 

38, a mail unit 37 for weighing and franking the item 38 
and post boxes 41 and 42. A vandal-proof door 77 separates 

the postal item 38 from the user during the weighing and 
franking operations. The system 31 also comprises a 

payment unit 43, a print device 44 for issuing a receipt 
and units for dispensing stamps 46 and envelopes 47.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an electronic franking
system for postal items comprising a weighing unit, having a
receiving surface and which can be activated to provide weight
data concerning a postal item deposited on said receiving
surface and to determine a franking amount relating to the
weight data, and separating devices for rendering the said
weighing unit inaccessible to a user during its activation.It is know from the International Publication No. WO-A-90/04824,
a franking system which comprises, in particular, a
weighing unit for determining an amount to be printed on a
postal item, a printing unit for printing bar code labels on
the postal item and a handling mechanism for moving the postal
item from the inserting area to a printing area. Such a
franking system is able to accept postcard, envelopes and
postal packages having a very limited thickness. Therefore the
known franking system is not able to manage thin or thick
postal items.
Moreover the printing unit of such a franking system is able to
print postal items pressed by a mechanical pressing unit over a
surface aligned with the print unit. Therefore the known
franking system, is not able to frank brittle postal items.
In addition the print unit of such a system is solely
controlled in X and Y directions.This invention provides an electronic franking system
which receives a postal item and franks it correctly without
the intervention of postal administration staff, and without
the user being able to carry out further handling after the
same postal item has been received.This is achieved by the electronic franking system
for postal items characterised by a handling mechanism having a 
moving rake disposed substantially parallel to said receiving
surface for moving the postal item after weighing.According to a further characteristic of this invention
the franking unit of the franking system comprises a print unit
having a print head actuatable for printing the franking amount
on the postal item in relation to the weight data of the postal
item.These and other aspects of the invention are defined
in the appended claims to which reference should now be made.These and other characteristics of the invention will
be obvious from the following description given by way of a
non-limiting example, with the help of the attached drawings,
where:
Fig. 1 shows a front right perspective view of a
franking system embodying the invention;Fig. 2 shows a front view of the system of Fig, 1,
depicting some internal units;Fig. 3 shows a cross section of the

<CLAIMS>
An electronic franking system for postal items,
comprising:


a weighing unit (66) having a receiving surface (74)
and which can be activated to provide weight data

concerning a postal item deposited on said receiving
surface (74) and to determine a franking amount relating

to said weight data; and
separating devices (77) for rendering the said
weighing unit (66) inaccessible to a user during its

activation;

   characterised by comprising a handling mechanism
(124)having


at least a moving rake (128, 129, 136, 137) disposed
substantially parallel to said receiving surface (74) for

moving the postal item after weighing.
An electronic franking system according to claim 1
characterised by


at least one post box (41,42) for storing postal
items, and in that
said handling mechanism (124) being actuatable for
moving the postal item from said weighing unit (66) to

said post box (41,42).
An electronic franking system according to claim 1 or
2 characterised in that said moving rake (128, 129, 136,

137) comprises a rigid bar (128, 136) for moving thick
postal items.
An electronic franking system according to claim 1, 2
or 3 characterised in that said moving rake (128, 129,

136, 137) comprises

flexible bands (129, 137) brushing against said
receiving surface (74) for moving thin or light postal

items.
An electronic franking system according to any
preceding claim, characterised in that said handling

mechanism (124) further comprises

an activating mechanism for moving said moving rake
(128, 129) from a rest position to a working position.
An electronic franking system according to any
preceding claim characterised by:


sensor devices (67) which provide signals indicating
the correct positioning of the postal item in a limited

zone of said receiving surface (74).
An electronic franking system according to any
preceding claim comprising a print unit (97) having a

print head (98) actuatable for printing said franking
amount on the postal item.
An electronic franking system according to claim 7,
characterised in that said print head (98) is actuatable

for moving in X, Y and Z directions with respect to said
postal item.
An electronic franking system according to claim 7 or
8, characterised in that said print unit (97) comprises


resting means (115) associated with said print head
(98) and having feedback means for stopping the movement
