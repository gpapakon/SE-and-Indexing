<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas 
purifying apparatus and method for an internal combustion 
engine, and more particularly, to an exhaust gas purifying 
apparatus and method suitable for purifying or removing 
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons contained 
in an exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion 
engine which is capable of operating effectively in a lean 
air to fuel ratio region. An exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion 
engine for a vehicle or the like contains toxic components 
such as carbon monoxide ( CO ), hydro-carbons ( HC ), 
nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) which are sources of air pollution. Therefore, so far, technology developments on 
purifying the exhaust gas with catalysts have been carried 
out. A main exhaust gas purifying method for the internal 
combustion engine is a method in which a so-called three 
way catalyst composed of catalytic substances such as Pt, 
Rh, Pd and so on is used for oxidizing and purifying the HC 
and CO and for reducing and purifying the NOx. The exhaust gas purifying method using catalysts is 
disadvantageous in that the exhaust gas is not sufficiently 
purified until the temperature of the engine rises up to 
about 300Â°C at which the catalyst exhibits its activity 
and therefore, the HC mostly produced when the engine  
 
starts cannot be substantially purified. Thus, it is 
desirable to develop a technology for purifying the HC 
during the period from the time when the engine starts to 
that when the temperature of the engine rises up to the 
temperature at which the catalyst exhibits its activity. In order to solve this problem, proposed in Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No.3-141816 (1991) is a method 
wherein the HC discharged when the engine starts is 
adsorbed by an adsorbent and the adsorbent is reactivated 
by its self-heating after completion of the warm-up of the 
engine. Incidentally, the three way catalyst can merely purify 
effectively the toxic components in the case where the 
engine is operating substantially in the vicinity of a 
theoretical or stoichiometric air to fuel ratio, i. e. the 
concentration of co-existing O2 in the exhaust gas is 
approximately 0.5 vol% or less. As well known, a narrow 
region in the vicinity of the stoichiometric air to fuel 
ratio including this is called a window. In view of this, 
although the air to fuel ratio for a vehicle changes 
according to the operating condition, the upper limit of 
the air-to-fuel A/F has been set at approximately 14.7 
which
