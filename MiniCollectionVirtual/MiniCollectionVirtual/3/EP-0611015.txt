<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for measured injection of additives in oil 
products and the like during successive and separate 

loading or unloading operations in tank farms, in 
particular for filling fuel to be transported by tank 

trucks, comprising at least two supply conduits (20B-D) 
for additives and each provided with a shut-off valve 

(29B-D) and interconnected (200) upstream of a common 
control valve (15) with a subsequent common conduit (20) 

for additives leading to a main conduit (10) for oil 
products and the like in which a particular supply 

conduit (10A) for said oil products and the like is 
adapted to be temporarily put into fluid connection with 

a point of the common conduit (20) oppositely with 
respect to the connection (43) thereof to the main 

conduit (10), and that a control unit (30) by means of at 
least one valve (29A, 41) establishes said fluid 

connection during a time interval which starts 
substantially simultaneously with or after closing of a 

shut-off valve (29B-D) for terminating an injection of 
additive before fulfilling a loading or unloading 

operation, whereby said oil products and the like from 
said particular supply conduit (10A) are flushed through 

the common conduit (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for injecting 
additives in oil products and the like during successive, 
separate loading or unloading operations on tank farms, 
in particular for filling of fuel to be transported by 
tank trucks. On tank farms where fuel is filled for 
transportation with tank trucks there is blended into 
each batch or load additives to the main part of the tank 
contents, which may be an oil product such as gasoline or 
diesel oil. There is often the question of a specific 
additive prescribed by the various oil companies to which 
fuel is delivered from the tank farm concerned. It is 
very important to obtain an accurate dosage of additives 
to each individual batch, and this represents a great 
measuring and regulating problem, in particular because 
it is desired to stop the injection of additive before 
the outflow of the main product (the oil product) 
terminates. This is important in order to avoid 
unintentional transfer of remainders of additive from a 
preceding batch for one tank truck to another batch in 
the next tank truck to be filled. It is therefore highly 
desirable to be able to clean all conduits to such a 
degree that any intermingling of different additives 
prescribed for example by different oil companies, will 
be essentially avoided in practice. On the basis of above, the invention relates to an 
arrangement for the injection of additives, comprising a 
particular supply of the actual oil product under the 
control of a control unit so as to remove remaining small 
amounts of an additive in the dosing system, before a 
subsequent filling operation is initiated, where another 
additive is to be used for the batch concerned, for 
example in the next tank truck to be filled. According to the present invention there is provided 
apparatus for measured injection of additives in oil 
products and the like during successive and separate  
 
loading or unloading operations in tank farms, in 
particular for filling fuel to be transported by tank 
trucks, comprising at least two supply conduits for 
additives and each provided with a shut-off valve and 
interconnected upstream of a common control valve with a 
subsequent common conduit for additives leading to a main 
conduit for oil products and the like in which a 
particular supply conduit for said oil products and the 
like is adapted to be temporarily put into fluid 
connection with a point of the common conduit oppositely 
with respect to the connection thereof to the main 
conduit, and that a control unit

Apparatus for measured injection of additives in oil 
products and the like during successive and separate 

loading or unloading operations in tank farms, in 
particular for filling fuel to be transported by tank 

trucks, comprising at least two supply conduits (20B-D) 
for additives and each provided with a shut-off valve 

(29B-D) and interconnected (200) upstream of a common 
control valve (15) with a subsequent common conduit (20) 

for additives leading to a main conduit (10) for oil 
products and the like characterised in that a particular 

supply conduit (10A) for said oil products and the like 
is adapted to be temporarily put into fluid connection 

with a point of the common conduit (20) oppositely with 
respect to the connection (43) thereof to the main 

conduit (10), and that a control unit (30) by means of at 
least one valve (29A, 41) establishes said fluid 

connection during a time interval which starts 
substantially simultaneously with or after closing of a 

shut-off valve (29B-D) for terminating an injection of 
additive before fulfilling a loading or unloading 

operation, whereby said oil products and the like from 
said particular supply conduit (10A) are flushed through 

the common conduit (20). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in 
that said particular supply conduit (10A) leads from a 

first point (P4C) at the main conduit (10) upstream of a 
main valve (40) therein, that a first by-pass conduit 

(47) leads from a point at the common conduit (20), 
preferably adjacent to the main conduit, with an 

intermediate check valve (43) directed towards the main 
conduit, to another point (P4D) downstream of the main 

valve (40). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in 
that a second by-pass conduit (48) provided with a valve 

(42) is arranged in parallel to the main valve (40) so as 
to establish an adjustable pressure drop across this when 

 
it is closed. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3 
characterized in that said first point (P4C) is located 

downstream of a measuring device (11) for the total flow 
in the main conduit (10). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim 
characterized in that a measuring device (22) for 

injected amount of additive in the common conduit (20), 
is adapted to be controlled by the control unit (30) to 

be inactivated during said time interval. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 characterized in 
that said measuring device (22) for injected amount of 

additive is located upstream of the control valve (15) in 
the common conduit (20). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim 
characterized in that the control unit (30) is adapted to 

open a particular valve (41) in said fluid connection 
when the main valve (40) is closed, during a time 

interval which substantially coincides with the time it 
takes to close the control valve. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim 
characterized in that the control unit (30) is adapted to 

perform a correction for the remaining amount of additive 
being present between the inter-connection point (200) at 

the upstream end of the common conduit (200) and the 
connection to the main conduit (10).
