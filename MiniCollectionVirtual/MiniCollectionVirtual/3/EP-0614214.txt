<ABSTRACT>
A process for plasma etching a compound semiconductor 
heterostructure, e.g. to fabricate a ridge laser on a wavelength 

demultiplexer comprises anisotropic etching of the semiconductor by 
exposure to a plasma incorporating methane, hydrogen and oxygen. The 

oxygen content of the plasma is derived from a gaseous precursor such 
as carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for dry etching of compound 
semiconductors and to semiconductor devices fabricated via the process. Reactive ion or plasma etching processes have been widely used for 
etching compound semiconductors, particularly III-V compounds, in the 
fabrication of optoelectronic devices such as lasers. A particular 
requirement of any fabrication process in this field is that of providing 
high quality flat optical surfaces e.g. mirror facets. Generally a 
methane/hydrogen mixture is employed as the etchant gas, but it has 
been found that this composition has a number of major disadvantages. 
Firstly, when etching a multilayer or heterostructure it is extremely difficult 
to provide smooth correctly oriented etched surfaces which can act as 
low loss mirrors. Secondly, polymer deposition can take place on the 
masking material and on the etched surface leading to surface 
roughening. Thirdly, the orientation of the etched surface is critically 
dependent on the balance between polymer deposition and etching of 
the semiconductor. Small variations in the etch conditions can thus have 
a significant effect on the quality of the etched surface. In consequence 
the process is difficult to control and results in relatively low yields of 
acceptable devices. In an attempt to address these disadvantages some workers have 
investigated the addition of free oxygen to the etchant gas mixture. A 
process of this nature is described by J W McNabb et all in J. Vac. Sci. 
Technol., B9(6), Nov/Dec 1991, p.3535. This has been found to reduce 
the problem of polymer deposition, but has shown little improvement in  
 
the reduction of surface roughness and the control of surface orientation. 
It will be appreciated that any roughening of a reflective surface causes 
significant loss of optical signals reflected from that surface. A further 
process for the plasma etching of gallium arsenide is described by L M 
Loewenstein in specification No. US-A-4,830,705. The object of the present invention is to minimise or to overcome these 
disadvantages. According to the invention there is provided a process for the anisotropic 
dry etching of a compound semiconductor double heterostructure 
comprising first and second indium phoshide layers (231,232) and an 
indium gallium arsenide phosphide layer (233) disposed therebetween, 
the process including masking a major surface of the heterostructure, 
providing openings in said mask defining regions of the heterostructure 
to be etched, and exposing the

A process for the anisotropic dry etching of a compound 
semiconductor double heterostructure comprising first and second 

indium phoshide layers (231,232) and an indium gallium arsenide 
phosphide layer (233) disposed therebetween, the process including 

masking a major surface of the heterostructure, providing openings in 
said mask defining regions of the heterostructure to be etched, and 

exposing the masked heterostructure under reduced pressure to a radio 
frequency plasma having an energy density of about 1 watt per cubic 

centimetre and comprising 190 to 195 sccm (standard cubic centimetres 
per minute) hydrogen, 30 to 35 sccm methane and 5 to 8 sccm carbon 

dioxide whereby to etch anisotropically the exposed portions of the 
heterostructure in a direction generally perpendicular to the major 

surface whereby to provide an optically reflective etched mirror surface. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
plasma is generated between a first grounded electrode and a second 

electrode to which radio-frequency power is applied. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that a steady 
(d.c.) electrical bias is maintained between the electrodes, the second 

electrode being maintained at a negative potential with reference to the 
first electrode.
