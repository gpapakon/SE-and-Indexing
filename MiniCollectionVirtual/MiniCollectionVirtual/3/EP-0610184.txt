<ABSTRACT>
A light exposure device for directly exposing photosensitive layers has a light source (2) and a pattern generator (3). The pattern generator (3) has an optical schlieren system (14) and an active, matrix-addressable surface light modulator (13). The schlieren system (14) has a schlieren objective (15) and a projection objective (16), as well as a reflecting device (17) arranged between both objectives that directs the light from the light source (2) onto the surface (19) of the surface light modulator (13). A filtering device (17, 17b) filters out diffracted light and lets through non diffracted light from the surface light modulator (13) to the projection objective (16). The structure to be exposed is secured on a movable positioning table (7). The surface light modulator is (13) addressed so that its non-addressed surface areas (19a, 19b, ...) correspond to the projection areas of the structure to be exposed.
