<ABSTRACT>
The filling and spreading device is used for introducing bone cement into the central cavity of a long bone during surgery. It has a straight tube (2) which is passed through a boer drilled through the end of the bone into the cavity. The cylindrical end (15) of the tube has a device (7) to help spread the cement on the inner wall of the cavity. The extreme end of the device has corrugations (13) superimposed in the generally circular shape and the device gradually tapers from the circular shape to the corrugated shape. Alternative shapes may include slots or vanes.

<CLAIMS>
A filling device (1) for introducing bone cement (5) into the
intramedullary canal (3) of a bone (4), having a filling cannula (2) and a

guide means (7; 8; 8.1, 8.2) for guiding the bone cement on issuing from the
end of the cannula, in the form of a flexible hose-like collar which at one

of its ends (15) is sealingly fixed in the region of the outlet opening (13)
of the filling cannula (2) and which is expandable in the radial direction

towards its free end (11) to bear against the inside of the intramedullary
canal by the bone cement which issues under pressure, characterised in that

the guide means has a surface reserve for the purposes of radial expansion,
which surface reserve increases towards its free end and is formed by

overlapping, formed by plate-like slitting of the guide means in the
direction of issue of the bone cement, or elasticity, and which in spite of

spreading of the free end by the issuing bone cement forms a closed collar
which prevents the bone cement (5) from rising up along the cannula (2).
A filling device according to claim 1 characterised in that the
deformability of the guide means (7; 8; 8.1, 8.2) increases in the direction

of issue of the filling material.
A filling device according to claim 1 characterised in that the
plate-like slitting is in the form of strip elements (8; 8.1, 8.2) extending

in the longitudinal direction.
A filling device according to claim 3 characterised in that the
strip elements are of a configuration involving two or more layers, wherein

the strip elements (8.1) of the upper layer respectively cover over the gaps
or join edges between the strip elements (8.2) of the lower layer. 
A filling device according to claim 4 characterised in that the
maximum extent of the cross-section of the strip elements (8; 8.1, 8.2)

extends in a substantially tangential direction of the filling cannula (2).
A filling device according to claim 3 characterised in that the
strip elements (8) are arranged substantially in a single-layer

configuration, wherein in each case the longitudinal edge (10) of a strip
element (8), which is the trailing edge in the peripheral direction,

projects sawtooth-like over the leading longitudinal edge (9) of the
subsequent strip element in cross-section at least in the rest position.
A filling device according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the guide means comprises substantially the same

material as the filling cannula (2) and in particular integrally adjoins
same.
A filling device according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the guide means comprises a rubber material or an

elastic plastic material.
A filling device according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the guide means (7) is pushed on at the free end (11)

of the filling cannula (2) and/or is fixed by adhesive.
