<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the direct determination of low density lipoprotein in 
body fluids. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a process and apparatus for determination of 
low density lipoprotein by selectively precipitating low 
density lipoprotein from a sample, providing enzymes which 
selectively consume the high density lipoprotein, and then 
resolubilizing the low density fraction and determining 
this fraction enzymatically. Lipoproteins are complex particles consisting of 
protein and lipid which are found in the circulatory 
system. One of the functions of lipoproteins is to carry 
water-insoluble substances such as cholesterol and 
cholesterol esters for eventual cellular use. While all 
cells require cholesterol for growth, excess accumulation 
of cholesterol by cells is known to lead to certain 
diseases, including atherosclerosis. It is known that the amount of total serum 
cholesterol can be correlated with the incidence of 
atherosclerosis. However, there are a variety of classes 
of lipoproteins in serum which can be classified by their 
density. These classes include very low density 
lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and 
high density lipoproteins (HDL). All of these classes of 
lipoproteins contain varying amounts of cholesterol, and a  
 
total serum cholesterol determination is a complex average 
of the amount that each lipoprotein class contributes to 
the total lipoprotein population of the serum. It has long been suspected that some lipoprotein 
classes are more closely associated than other lipoprotein 
classes with the progression of heart disease, including 
atherosclerosis. In fact, more recent studies have 
implicated LDL as the class of lipoproteins responsible 
for the accumulation of cholesterol in cells, whereas HDL 
has been shown to be important in the removal of excess 
cholesterol from cells. Additionally the correlation of 
atherosclerosis and the levels of LDL cholesterol is much 
higher than a similar correlation between atherosclerosis 
and total serum cholesterol levels. Conversely, there 
appears to be a negative correlation between 
atherosclerosis and HDL cholesterol levels. Despite the desirability of differentiating LDL 
cholesterol levels in blood plasma from those of other 
soluble cholesterols, a technique suitable for use in 
clinical laboratories has not heretofore existed. One 
method which has been suggested relies upon the 
interaction of heparin in the presence of calcium to 
precipitate
