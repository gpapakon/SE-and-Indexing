<ABSTRACT>
An instrument for the electrical connection of 
predetermined areas of a plate of semiconductor 

material to metal terminals by portions of wire (6). 
It includes a bonding head (7) with an ultrasound 

transducer (1) which makes a capillary tube (3), 
through which the wire runs, vibrate along a 

predetermined direction. 
In order to improve the quality of the bonding of 
the wire (6) to the metal terminals (8''), a resonator 

is provided (4) for making the end of the ultrasound 
transducer (1), to which the capillary tube (3) is 

fixed, vibrate along a direction perpendicular to that 
of the vibrations induced by the transducer itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an instrument for the 
electrical connection of predetermined areas of a plate 
of semiconductor material, commonly known as a "chip", 
to metal terminals by fine wires. In the manufacture of semiconductor electronic 
devices, in particular integrated circuits, operations 
to connect the chip to the metal terminals used for 
external connections are generally carried out by 
microbonding fine gold wires, using either heat-compression 
or ultrasound. Such operations are 
normally carried out by instruments known as wire 
bonders, which have a bonding head which includes a 
ceramic capillary tube through which runs a gold wire, 
means for supporting and feeding this wire and an 
ultrasound generator or, alternatively, 
microresistances which act on the gold wire. The type of instrument most commonly used and to 
which, in any case, this invention relates, is that 
using ultrasound. It is known that a fundamental requirement in 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is that such  
 
products be highly and consistently reliable. This 
reliability depends largely on the quality of the 
bonding that connects the chip and the external 
terminals of the semiconductor device. In order to 
improve these bonds, it is necessary to have access to 
ever more advanced instruments. A few details of one commonly used instrument are 
illustrated in Figure 1. In particular, a chip 5 is 
fixed, along with other similar chips to a metal strip 
8 worked in such a way as to have identical structures 
each having one portion 8' which acts as support for 
the chip and others 8" which will be the terminals of 
the device. This strip rests on a heated base 10 and 
is advanced by means which are not shown in such a way 
that each chip may be bonded in turn. The bonding head of the instrument, generally 
indicated 7, has an ultrasound transducer 1 which 
includes an ultrasound generator 9 and a metal portion 
2 for transmitting the ultrasonic vibrations to a 
ceramic capillary tube 3 which is securely fixed to one 
end of the portion 2 and extends perpendicular thereto. 
A device, in itself known and therefore not shown, 
feeds and supports a fine gold wire 6. The gold wire 
6 runs through the capillary tube 3.  
 
The ultrasound transducer 1 transmits to the ceramic 
capillary tube 3 containing the gold wire a 
reciprocating movement at an ultrasonic frequency in a 
fixed direction which coincides with the axis Y of the 
transducer itself. This vibration, together with the 
pressure exerted by the
