<ABSTRACT>
A process for the catalytic conversion of 
various chlorinated hydrocarbon byproducts and waste 

products especially to less chlorinated, useful or 
salable products, in which a chlorinated hydrocarbon 

feedstock containing two or more chlorines is reacted 
with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst consisting 

essentially of an active hydrogenating metal component 
such as platinum in elemental or compound form, and a 

surface segregating metal component such as copper in 
elemental or compound form on a support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
processes for converting chlorinated hydrocarbons to
less chlorinated products and to the catalysts used in
such processes.European Patent Application EP-A-0496446
describes the preparation of chlorotrifluoroethylene and
trifluoroethylene from 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2--trifluoroethane
via a catalyst comprised of copper and
a Group VIII or noble metal (palladium and platinum
being preferred) on a carbon support. Several prior
publications address the same conversion and describe
the same or different catalysts, see, for example EP-B-0253410
, EP-B-0355907 and EP-A-0459463 . None of these
publications describes or suggests, however, that other
halogenated feedstocks might be suitably catalytically
converted to less halogenated and more useful or more
salable materials, and in particular none of these
references suggest that the catalysts described therein
might be useful outside of the fluorocarbon art.A seemingly separate course of development has
occurred with respect to the class of chlorinated
hydrocarbon feedstocks which are exclusive of the
chlorofluorocarbon feedstocks (and which will henceforth
and for simplicity be referred to generically as the
chlorinated hydrocarbon feedstocks).With respect to such chlorinated hydrocarbon
feedstocks, a number of references may be found which
relate to the conversion of a chlorinated alkane
feedstock to a less chlorinated alkene product. For 
example, EP 015665 describes the conversion of 1,1,2-trichloroethane
to ethylene or to vinyl chloride via a
catalyst including a noble metal chloride, an alkali
metal chloride, iron chloride and optionally copper
chloride on a silica or alumina support. An earlier
Japanese patent publication JP 77/31005 which is
referenced in the EP 015665 publication relates to the
same overall process, but employs a catalyst of
palladium chloride, copper chloride and an alkali metal
chloride on a support.US-A-2,886,605 to McClure
et al. describes processes for reducing the chlorine or
bromine content of halohydrocarbons containing one or
both of these halogens via a cuprous halide on porous
active alumina catalyst. Specifically contemplated are
processes for converting 1,2-dichloropropane to
propylene and hydrogen chloride, for converting
perchloroethylene to trichloroethylene, and for
converting 1,1,2-trichloroethane to vinyl chloride.British patent GB 1,400,529 to Scharfe broadly
relates to processes for converting byproduct and waste
"hydrocarbon chlorides" to "chlorine-free hydrocarbons"
via a

<CLAIMS>
A process for the conversion of a chlorinated alkane
feedstock containing two or more chlorines to reaction

products including a less chlorinated alkene in a
commercially substantial proportion, wherein the

chlorinated alkane feedstock is reacted with hydrogen in
the presence of a supported catalyst consisting

essentially of an active hydrogenating metal component in
elemental or compound form and a surface segregating

metal component in elemental or compound form on a
support, the relative concentrations of the metal

components being selected so that the less chlorinated
alkene is produced in preference, provided that

when the active hydrogenating metal component is a Group
VIII metal or a plurality of such Group VIII metals, the

surface segregating metal component is other than a Group
IB metal or a plurality of such Group IB metals.
A process as defined in claim 1, wherein the
catalyst consists of an active hydrogenating metal

component and a surface segregating metal component on a
support.
A process as defined in claims 1 or 2, wherein
hydrogen chloride is incorporated in the feed to the

process.
A process as defined in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the active hydrogenating metal component consists

of one or more Group VIII metals in elemental or compound
form and the surface segregating metal component is

selected from among the metals, in elemental or compound
form, of Groups IIB, IIIA or IIIB, IVA or IVB, VA or VB, 

VIA or VIIA, or from remaining Group VIII metals which
will surface segregate with the selected one or more

Group VIII active hydrogenating metals.
A process as defined in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the catalyst has been pretreated by exposure to a

chloride source.
A process as defined in claim 1, wherein the
chlorinated alkane feedstock is 1,2,3-trichloropropane

and one or both of allyl chloride and propylene are
produced in a commercially substantial proportion.
A process as defined in claim 1, wherein the
chlorinated alkane feedstock is 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane

and one or both of vinylidene chloride and ethylene are

produced in a commercially substantial proportion.
A process as defined in claim 1, wherein the
chlorinated alkane feedstock is 1,1,2-trichloroethane and

vinyl chloride is produced in a commercially substantial
proportion.
A process as defined in claim 1, wherein the
chlorinated alkane feedstock is 1,2-dichloropropane and

propylene is produced in a commercially substantial
proportion.
