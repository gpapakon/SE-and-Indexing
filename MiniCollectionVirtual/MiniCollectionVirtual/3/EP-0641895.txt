<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of wire-grating mats (2 to 4) in a three-dimensional support structure (1). The wire-grating mats (2 to 4) essentially consist of intersecting longitudinal and transverse wires (10 to 17) and has at opposite sides (18, 19) longitudinal-rod ends which follow a curve (21) and terminate with a length (22, 25) adjoining the curve (21, 24). The longitudinal-rod ends at one mat side are arranged in the mat plane while forming a hairpin (20) and at the opposite side (19) form a loop (23) which is bent at one side out of the mat plane in a curve, carries a transverse rod (28) in the curve (27) and is made to interlock by pushing the hairpin (20) with its straight length (22) adjoining the curve (21) of the hairpin (20) in between the loop head (24) and the transverse rod (28) arranged in the curve. The three-dimensional support structure (1) consists of several wire-grating mats (2 to 4, 35, 50) which are connected to one another and are arranged in intersecting directions for at least one direction of the support structure (1) in which several successive wire-grating mats (2, 3) successively serve to produce interlocking connections between them, the support of the hairpin (20) on the loops (23) being flexurally rigid in the direction of the outwardly acting pressure of the support structure.

Method of manufacturing three dimensional supporting frameworks (1)
for reinforcing loose material, which comprise wire lattice mats, which have

substantially intersecting longitudinal and transverse wires, the longitudinal bar
ends of which disposed at opposite sides (18,19) of a mat follow a curve (21)

and terminate with a length (22,25) connected to the curves (21,24) and whose
longitudinal bar ends disposed on one side (18) of a mat define a hairpin (20),

whilst those at the other side (19) of the mat define a loop (23) whose curved
portion (27) is bent on one side out of the plane of the mat and carries a

transverse bar (28), whereby wire lattice mats which are in alignment with one
another become stiff in bending by pushing the straight length (22) connected to

the arcuate portion (21) of the hairpin (20) in a form locking manner between
the loop head (24) and transverse bar (28) and on one side by supporting the

hairpin (20) on the loops, characterised in that the aligned wire lattice mats (2,3)
are so arranged in one direction of the supporting framework that they are stiff

in bending to the exterior and that wire lattice mats are arranged in intersecting
directions which utilise the same connection at the intersection point (8) as the

aligned wire lattice mats and are pushed with their transverse bar (32) from the
rear side of the aligned wire lattice mat (3) into the bend (14a) up to the

transverse bar (28) ofthe aligned wire lattice mat (2,3).
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the wire lattice
mats (2,3) disposed at one end of the supporting framework (1) have loops and

hairpins at the beginning and at the end of the one aligned row of wire lattice
mats and are so arranged at right-angles that the straight length (22) connected

to the arcuate portion (24) of the loop comes to rest between the transverse bar 
(28) and the arcuate portion of the loop and the arcuate portions (21) of the

hairpins embrace the arcuate portions (24) of the loops.
A method as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the wire lattice mats (2,3) arranged at the beginning and at

the end of the supporting structure (1) are connected at the intersection points
with spiral springs.
A method as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that wire lattice mats are arranged in the supporting framework

(1) in an incident direction at which at least one of the transverse bars (16) at
the edge defines an acute angle with the transverse bars (17) which intersect

with the longitudinal bars (37 to 47) at right-angles.
A method as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that steps (36) are arranged in the supporting framework with

the aid of wire lattice mats whose transverse bars (37 to 42; 43 to 47) have two
different lengths and are arranged at one side (48) of the mat with aligned ends.
System for manufacturing three-dimensional supporting structures for
reinforcing loose material from wire lattice mats, which have substantially

intersecting longitudinal and transverse wires, the longitudinal bar ends of
which disposed at opposite sides (18,19) of a mat follow a curve (21) and

terminate with a length (22,25) connected to the curves (21,24) and whose
longitudinal bar ends disposed on one side (18) of a mat define a hairpin (20),

whilst those at the other side (19) of the mat define a loop (23) whose curved
portion (27) is bent on one side out of the plane of the mat and carries a 

transverse bar (28), whereby wire lattice mats which are in alignment with one
another become stiff in bending by pushing the straight length (22) connected to

the arcuate portion (21) of the hairpin (20) in a form locking manner between
the loop head (24) and transverse bar (28) and on one side by supporting the

hairpin (20) on the loops, characterised in that for intersection points (8) of the
supporting structure on one wire lattice mat their longitudinal bar ends (32,33)

at the edge terminate at a transverse bar (32) which has a smaller cross-section
than the transverse bar (28) arranged in the arcuate portion (27) of the loop and

that the arcuate portions (25,28) of the bend (14a) of the loop (23) are so
selected that in addition to the straight end length (22) of each hairpin (20) the

transverse bar (32) fits into the arcuate portion of the bend (14a).
System for manufacturing three-dimensional supporting frameworks for
reinforcing loose material from wire lattice mats, which have substantially

intersecting longitudinal and transverse wires, the longitudinal bar ends of
which disposed at opposite sides (18,19) of a mat follow a curve (21) and

terminate with a length (22,25) connected to the curves (21,24) and whose
longitudinal bar ends disposed on one side (18) of a mat define a hairpin (20),

whilst those at the other side (19) of the mat define a loop (23) whose curved
portion (27) is bent on one side out of the plane of the mat and carries a

transverse bar (28), whereby wire lattice mats which are in alignment with one
another become stiff in bending by pushing the straight length (22) connected to

the arcuate portion (21) connected to the arcuate portion (21) of the hairpin (20)
in a form locking manner between the loop head (24) and transverse bar (28)

and on one side by supporting the hairpin (20) of the loops, characterised in that
a comb-like element (56) is provided for connecting transverse bars (59,60) and

longitudinal bars (57,87) of sloped mats (53,54), which has a plurality of 
transverse bars (61) in a parallel arrangement, which are secured with their ends

to a longitudinal bar (62) and, below their fastening point (63) have a bend,
whose vertex (64) connects a short end (65) with the longitudinal bar (62) and a

longer end (66) together.
A system as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that provided for the
form lock of the wire lattice mats arranged at the ends of the supporting

framework (1) in the intersection points there are comb elements (67) whose
shortened longitudinal bars (68) are provided with hairpin-shaped ends (69)

which correspond to the hairpins of the wire lattice mats (2,3).
