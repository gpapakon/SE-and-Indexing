<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
controlling an automobile engine, and more particularly to 
an apparatus for interconnecting a plurality engine control 
systems by serial data transmission. As automobile controls become more sophisticated, the 
volume of signal communications between them and the number 
of sensors and actuators increase. As a result, the number 
of couplings among control apparatuses increases. One 
method which has been developed to reduce the wiring 
requirement for interconnection of engine controls and 
actuators is to provide for serial data transmission by 
means of input/output (I/O) units which are separate from 
the central control unit. For example, in Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open No. 4-203344, necessary data is 
transmitted to and from control units such as an engine 
control unit and a transmission control unit, serially by 
microcomputer programs, according to predetermined 
transmission procedures. It is thus possible to transmit 
data serially to two separate a control units by using 
respective microcomputers. However, since each control 
unit has its own microcomputer for the purpose of 
processing parallel-serial transmission of information  
 
multiple microcomputers are used for the same control 
function, and the required amount of hardware and software 
increases. Moreover, in the aforementioned serial transmission 
arrangement, the drive interface for the ignition coil of 
the engine control apparatus and for the fuel injection 
valve is provided as a separate I/O unit. Thus, when such 
serial data transmission is utilised, a failure of the 
transmission line, such as a disconnection of an optical 
fiber or a faulty electrical contact, interrupts the 
transmission of signals from the control unit, and the 
automobile is no longer operable. GB-A- 21 03 836 discloses an engine 
controller with several microprocessors 114,200,300 an 
I/O circuit 112,132 and a backup circuit 133. CPU 114 and I/O 
circuit are serially connected with a bus, the I/O circuit 
receives/sends parallel data thus has to contain parallel/ 
serial and serial/parallel data interfaces. The CPU having 
parallel inputs and outputs has to be connected to parallel/ 
serial interfaces. The backup 138 is connected to input and 
output lines, however does not communicate with the I/O system 
via the bus 116 and monitors any trouble in the microprocessor 
system components 
and in case of trouble provides backup signals 
to the actuators based on sensor signals. An object of
