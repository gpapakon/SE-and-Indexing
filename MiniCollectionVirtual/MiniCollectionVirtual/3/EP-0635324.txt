<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a withdrawal apparatus in the horizontal part of a continuous casting installation with a clamping device which can be moved forwards and back parallel to the billet and can be moved at least in the direction of movement of the billet by tensile means. The apparatus is characterised in that the clamping device (10) has a two-armed yoke (11, 12) which is provided with a joint (15), which overlaps the billet and on the bottom ends of the arms of which clamping jaws (13, 14) are secured in articulated fashion, these clamping jaws being guided parallel to the billet axis (I) by tensile means (20) and being pivotably connected at one end to the clamping jaws (13, 14) and at the other end to the foundation (31) of the continuous casting installation (30), and in that elements (40) are provided which, together with the tensile means (20), permit unhindered guidance of the clamping jaws (13, 14) parallel to the direction of movement of the billet during the clamping phase and - after the return movement - exact positioning with respect to the next clamping phase.

A withdrawal device in the horizontal part of a
continuous-casting installation, having a clamping

device which can be moved back and forth parallel to
the billet, which device can be moved at least in the

direction of travel of the billet by traction means,

characterised in that

the clamping device (10) has a two-armed stirrup (11,
12) provided with an articulation (15) and extending

over the billet, to the arms of which stirrup clamping
jaws (13, 14) are fastened in articulated manner at the

foot end, which jaws are guided parallel to the billet
axis (I) with traction means (20; 23, 24), said

traction means being pivotably connected firstly to the
clamping jaws (13, 14) and secondly to the base (31,

32) of the continuous-casting installation (30), and
that elements (40, 43, 44) are provided which together

with the traction means (20) permit hindrance-free
guidance of the clamping jaws (13, 14) parallel to the

direction of travel of the billet during the clamping
phase and - after the return - exact positioning for

the next clamping phase, and that the stirrups (11, 12)
of the clamping device (10) are connected by closing

means, e.g. by a piston-cylinder unit (16).
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the clamping jaw (14) is held via
traction elements (43) on a mast (33) connected to the

base (32) of the continuous-casting installation (30).
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the clamping jaw (13) is
supported via pressure elements (44) on the base (31)

of the continuous-casting installation (30). 
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 2 or 3,

characterised in that the traction and pressure
elements (43, 44) are arranged at an angle of 35 to 40Â°

to the billet axis (I) and have a length compensation
element (45).
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the length compensation element
(45) has a spring (46) the force of which is

adjustable.
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the length compensation element
(45) is a controllable piston-cylinder unit (47).
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the traction means (20) are
piston-cylinder units (23, 24).
[A withdrawal device] according to Claims 7 and 6,

characterised in that the piston-cylinder units (23,
24, 47) are servo units which can be connected to a

programmable control means (60).
[A withdrawal device] according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the traction means (20) are
spindle-nut units (25).
