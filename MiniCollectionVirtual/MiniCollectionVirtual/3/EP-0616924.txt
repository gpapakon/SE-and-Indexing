<ABSTRACT>
A transmitter (Ü) is provided by means of which it is possible to transmit both energy (in one direction) and data (in both directions). In addition, switching means (A1,A2,P1,P2,Q1,Q2) which control and evaluate the transmission sequence are provided on both sides of the transmitter. The transmission of data from the primary side to the secondary side is performed by means of a short interruption of a primary-side switching route during the energy storage phase (ESP) while the data transmission in the opposite direction is performed by a secondary-side load pulse during the energy storage phase (ESP).

Device for wireless transmission of energy and 
data, having a transformer (Ü) via which the energy is 

transmitted in one direction and the data is transmitted 
in both directions, and having switching means (A1, A2, 

P1, P2, Q1, Q2) on both sides of the transformer, by 
which the transmission process is controlled and evaluated, 

characterized in that a diode (D2), the anode of 
which is connected to a terminal (3) of the secondary 

winding (L2), is provided on the secondary side of the 
transformer (Ü) and is connected, forward-biased to a 

voltage controller (V2), in that the cathode of a further 
diode (D3) is connected to the terminal (3) of the 

secondary winding (L2), and in that a diode (D4), the 
cathode of which is connected to the other terminal (4) 

of the secondary winding (L2), is provided, the other 
terminal (4) being connected via a resistor (R6) and a 

switching transistor (Q2) to the earth on the secondary 
side, and the winding terminals (3) and (4) being connected 

to the switching means (A2) by which the transistor 
(Q2) on the secondary side is controlled. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the transformer (Ü) has a primary winding and a 

secondary winding (L1, L2) with reversed winding sense, 
one of the windings (L1) being arranged fixed in the 

transformer (Ü) whilst the other winding (L2) can move 
relative thereto. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the fixed winding is connected to the steering 

column of a motor vehicle and the movable winding is  
 

connected to the steering wheel of a motor vehicle. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the primary winding of the transformer is assigned 

to the chassis of the motor vehicle, whilst the secondary 
winding is assigned to the steering wheel. 
Method for energy and data transmission with a 
device according to Claim 1, a primary-side circuit path 

(Q1, R3) being closed during an energy storage phase,
 
the energy transmission from the primary side to the 

secondary side taking place by interrupting the primary-side 
circuit path (Q1, R3),
 
data transmission from the primary to the secondary side 

taking place by a brief interruption in the primary-side 
circuit path (Q1, R3) during the energy storage phase,
 
the data transmission from the secondary side to the 

primary side taking place by a secondary-side load pulse 
during the energy storage phase,
 
the control of the information transmission taking place 

by means of drive and evaluation means (A1, A2) provided 
on the primary side and on the secondary side, and
 
the information being evaluated both on the primary side 

and on the secondary side in the drive and evaluation 
means (A1, A2) which are each connected to a processor. 
Method according to Claim 5, in which the data 
transmission from the secondary side to the primary side 

is effected by a load pulse on the secondary side, which 
causes a current pulse in the primary winding (L2) which 

is evaluated in the drive and evaluation means (A1) in a 
comparator. 
Method according to Claim 5, in which, on the 
secondary side, the voltage at a potential divider formed 

by the resistors (R4, R5) is measured by the processor 
(P2), and this voltage is transmitted as data information 

to the primary side and controlled. 
Method according to Claim 5 and 6, in which the 
drive and evaluation means (A2) control the load on the 

secondary side in such a way that the data can be transmitted 
serially.  

 
Method according to Claim 8, in which the switching 
frequency on the primary side and on the secondary 

side are equal, and in which the data transmission is in 
the region of approximately 125 kHz. 
Method according to Claim 5, in which for data 
transmission from the primary side to the secondary side 

during the energy storage phase, the voltage pulse is 
briefly interrupted on the primary side, which causes a 

brief voltage pulse phase opposition on the secondary 
winding, the current caused by this being evaluated as 

data information in a comparator in the drive and evaluation 
means (A2) on the secondary side. 
Method according to Claim 10, in which the 
interruption time of the primary side is known on the 

secondary side through prior setting. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 5 to 
11, in which the times of the voltage interruption on the 

primary side do not temporally coincide with the time of 
the load pulse on the secondary side. 
Method according to Claim 12, in which the times 
occur in the same switching phase (full duplex operation). 
Method according to Claim 5, in which, for 
transmitting the data in both or one direction the 

primary side is synchronized with the secondary side. 
Method according to Claim 14, in which the 
synchronization involves use of the positive edge (F1) at 

the start of the energy storage phase. 
Method according to Claim 14, in which one of the 
two edges (F2, F3) of the pulse produced during the 

primary-side break in the switching path is used for the 
synchronization. 
Method according to Claim 14, in which the data 
pulse is divided into a synchronization pulse and an 

information pulse. 
Method according to Claim 5, in which the data 
are transmitted only in every other period, in order to 

broaden the control range of the energy transmission.
