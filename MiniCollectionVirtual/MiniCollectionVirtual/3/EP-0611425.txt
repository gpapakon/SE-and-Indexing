Gear-changing arrangement for the gear-changing actuation 
of multi-stage gear-changing gearboxes for motor vehicles, 


having a number of gear-changing rockers (12) which can 
be pivoted about a point of rotation (13) integral with 

the casing and are each associated with a gear-changing 
sleeve; 
wherein the gear-changing rocker arm (15) of the gear-changing 
rockers (12), which is located above the point 

of rotation (13), is displaced into the gear-changing 
positions via at least one gear-changing element (1, 4) 

which operates essentially parallel to the axis of the 
gears in the gearbox, 
characterised in that
the gear-changing element, of which there is at least 
one, consists of a single thrust rod (1), which is 

displaceable parallel to the axis of the gears in the 
neutral and speed-changing positions, and of a number of 

individually actuatable coupling mechanisms associated 
with the gear-changing rockers (12) in each case; 
a coupling mechanism in the unactuated condition 
immovably fixes one gear-changing rocker (12) in each 

case on a part (3) integral with the casing and at the 
same time releases the displacement of the thrust rod (1) 

and 
a coupling mechanism in the actuated/engaged condition, 
under the effect of a coupling force, produces a driving 

connection between the thrust rod (1) and a gear-changing 
rocker (12) and at the same time severs the connection of 

the said gear-changing rocker (12) to the part (3) 
integral with the casing. 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the coupling mechanism has a coupling 
bolt (4) which can be displaced perpendicularly to the 

direction of gear-changing movement of the thrust rod (1) or 
to the direction of the gear-changing force (2) and, at the  

 
same time, axially in relation to the gear-changing rocker arm 

(15) and which is displaceably mounted, by one of its ends, on 
the gear-changing rocker arm (15) and, by its other end, in 

the uncoupled condition, engages in a form-locking manner in 
the part (3) integral with the casing, at the same time 

releasing the thrust rod (1) in a displaceable manner or, in 
the coupled condition, engages in a form-locking manner in the 

thrust rod (1) which can continue to be displaced. 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 2,
characterised in that
 the coupling mechanism has a coupling 
bolt (4) with: 


a coupling shaft (6) which is connected to the gear-changing 
rocker arm (15), 
and a coupling head (7) which, engaging in a form-locking 
manner in corresponding cut-out portions (10, 8) in the 

thrust rod (1) and in the part (3) integral with the 
casing, can be thrust in and out. 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 the cut-out portions (8, 10) for the 
coupling head (7) in the part (3) integral with the casing and 

in the thrust rod (1) are disposed, in the neutral position of 
the thrust rod (1), in alignment with one another in the 

direction of the coupling force (5). 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 there are provided, in the thrust rod

direction and through which, in the uncoupled condition, the 
coupling shafts (6) of the coupling bolts (4) reach in a 

displaceable manner. 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 the coupling bolts (4) have an 
essentially T-shaped construction, the coupling heads (7) 

being disposed transversely to the gear-changing direction  
 

(2), and there are provided, in the thrust rod (1), 
essentially cross-shaped cut-out portions (9), the 

longitudinal slots (11) of which are the oblong holes for the 
passage of the coupling shafts and the transverse slots (10) 

of which are designed for the engagement of the coupling heads 
(7). 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 6,
characterised in that
 the coupling shaft (6) and coupling head 
(7) have an essentially identical, round cross-section in each 

case. 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 6,
characterised in that

 the part (3) integral with the casing is 
an outer wall (3) of the casing. 
Gear-changing arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the part (3) integral with the casing is
