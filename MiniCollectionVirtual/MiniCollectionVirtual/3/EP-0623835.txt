<ABSTRACT>
The angle adjustment system uses a test body (16) with at least one test surface (14',14",14"') carrying a marking line (17,17',17") corresponding to the scanning line (15) with a marking (18, 18', 18") at a given point along its length. The scanner housing (11) is pivoted about one or two axes (x,y) to bring a marked point (20) along the scanning line into alignment with the test surface marking before pivoting the housing about a further axis (z) to bring the scanning line into alignment with the marking line. Pref. the marked point lies at the centre of the scanning line, the first two axes perpendicular to the scanning beam (12") being directed onto the marked point.

Method for the angular adjustment of a linear scanning 
apparatus adjustable about all spatial axes (x, y, z) 

comprising a housing (11) from which a scanning light 
beam (12) emerges, which is directed onto a scanning 

surface (14) of an object (19), which is preferably 
moved past the housing, and generates a light bead (13) 

there, with the light beam defining a scanning line (15) 
on the scanning surface (14), in that it is periodically 

moved over a predetermined width (B) along the latter, 
wherein the scanning surface (14) is to be arranged at a 

predetermined distance (A) and wherein a light receiver 
(29) is also provided, preferably in the housing, which 

receives light reflected from the object (19) and transmits 
an electrical signal to an evaluation circuit (30) 

which evaluates the signal, for example with respect to 
the presence of a code, characterized in that the scanning 

light bead (13) is caused to mark at least one predetermined 
point (20) of the scanning line (15); in that 

a test body (16) with at least one test scanning surface 
(14', 14", 14"'), on which a marking line (17, 17', 17") 

to be associated with the scanning line (15) and a mark 
(18, 18', 18") to be associated with the predetermined 

point (20) of the scanning line (15) are located arranged 
at the location where the article (19) is later 

to be arranged or moved past; in that by pivoting the 
housing (11) about at least one and preferably two axes 

(x, y) the marked point (20) of the scanning line (15) 
is first brought into alignment with the mark (18, 18', 

18") on the test body (16), and in that the scanning 
line (15) is subsequently brought into alignment with 

the marking line (17, 17', 17") by pivoting of the housing 
(11) about a further axis (z).  

 
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
the marking (20) of the scanning line (15) consists of 

an elevated or reduced brightness of the scanning light 
beam at a specific point or of a brightness step. 
Method in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that 
the marked point (20) is located at least substantially 

at the center of the scanning line (15). 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the housing (11) is first pivoted 

about axes (x, y) extending perpendicular to the scanning 
beam (12") directed to the marked point (20) until 

the marked point (20) is aligned with the mark (18); and 
in that a pivoting of the housing (11) then takes place 

around an axis (z) which coincides with or extends parallel 
to, preferably as close as possible to, the scanning 

beam (12") directed to the marked point (20). 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that with a test body (16) having a 

plurality of test scanning surfaces (14', 14", 14"') a 
plurality of linear scanning devices are adjusted simultaneously 

or one after the other in accordance with one 
of the preceding claims. 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pivotal coordinate system (x, 

y, z) has its origin at a universal point of rotation 
(22) of the housing (11) and the one axis (y) of the coordinate 

system extends parallel to the marking line 
(17, 17', 17").
