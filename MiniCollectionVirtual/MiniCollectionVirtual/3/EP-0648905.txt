<ABSTRACT>
Partitioning panel (20) formed by a central core (1) made of insulating material lying between two rigid skins forming facings (2, 3) rendered integral with the core (1), which panel (20) includes at least one fastening device consisting of an insert built into the panel and with which at least one external assembly means can interact after this assembly means has passed exclusively through the non visible one (3) of the said facings, so as to allow the panel (20) to be erected without mechanical intervention on the other facing (2) which is intended to be visible, characterised in that the insert (9) is rendered integral with the inner face of the visible facing (2) so as to transfer to it any tensile loading exerted by the corresponding assembly means (10) while the panel (20) is being erected, and consequently acting by compression on the central core (1) of this panel.

Partitioning panel (20) formed by a central core 
of insulating material, arranged between two rigid skins 

forming wall facings (2, 3) joined to the core (1), the 
said panel (20) having at least one fixing device 

comprising an insert integrated in the panel and by means 
of which it can co-operate with at least one external 

assembly means inserted only through the one (3) of the 
two wall facings that is not visible, such that the panel 

(20) can be assembled, without the need for mechanical 
means, with the other wall facing (2) which is designed 

to be visible, the insert (9) consisting of a section, of 
which at least a first planar face (9b) is joined to the 

inside face of the visible wall facing (2), whilst a 
second parallel, planar face (9c) facing the opposite 

non-visible inside face of the wall facing is designed to 
co-operate with the assembly means (10), characterised in 

that the second planar face (9c) of the insert (9) is 
positioned at a distance from the said inside face of the 

non-visible wall facing (3) such that any tensile stress 
exerted by the means (10) when assembling the panel (20) 

is transferred to the said visible wall facing (2) and 
consequently exerts a compression force against the 

central core (1) of the panel (20). 
Panel as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the section (9) delineates a quadrangular hollow 

cross-section. 
Panel as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the cross-section of the section forming the insert 

(9) is of U-shaped design in which the parallel vertical 
branches (9a) are extended in opposing perpendicular 

directions at the exterior so as to form lateral wings 
(9b) joined to the inside face of the visible wall facing 

(2).  
 
Panel as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that the lateral wings (9b) of the insert (9) are joined 

to the inside face of the central visible wall facing (1) 
and bonded to the walls facings (2, 3). 
Panel as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that the lateral wings (9b) of the insert (9) are joined 

to the inside face of the visible panel (2) by means of 
the central core (1), this being a panel whose central 

core is made using a moulding process whereby a substance 
is injected between the walls (2, 3). 
Panel as claimed in one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the lateral wings (9b) of the 

section forming the insert (9) are located in two 
successive corresponding grooves (15) formed on at least 

the visible wall facing (2) of the said panel (20) and in 
the longitudinal direction thereof. 
Panel as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the section forming the insert (9) 

is of a length essentially corresponding to that of the 
panel (20) and is arranged parallel with one of its 

longitudinal sides. 
Panel as claimed in one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that the quadrangular hollow portion of 

the section forming the insert (9) is filled with a 
material of the same nature as that used to form the 

central core (1) of the said panel (20). 
Panel as claimed in one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that the quadrangular hollow portion of 

the section forming the insert (9) is left free so as to 
form a technically integrated sheath. 
Panel as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the assembly means (10) on a fixed 

support (14) comprises a screw which is screwed into the 
planar face (9c) of the insert (9) facing the non-visible 

inside wall facing (3)having been inserted through this  
 

latter. 
Panel as claimed in claim 10, characterised in 
that a backing-plate for securing purposes (16) is 

arranged underneath the planar face (9c) of the insert 
(9) facing the inside face of the non-visible wall facing 

(3) as a means of strengthening the rigidity of the 
insert (9) on a level with the self-tapping screw (10). 
Panel as claimed in claim 11, characterised in 
that a backing-plate for securing purposes (16) is 

arranged in at least the zones at the ends of each insert 
(9). 
Panel as claimed in claims 11 and 12, 
characterised in that the backing-plate for securing 

purposes (16) is pre-secured to the insert (9) by 
adhesive or mechanical means.
