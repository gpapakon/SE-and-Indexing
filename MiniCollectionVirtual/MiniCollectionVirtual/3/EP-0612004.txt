<ABSTRACT>
A system for configuring a second biomedical 
device in the same configuration as a first device. The 

first device is configured as desired and then is connected 
through a communication link to the second device to be 

configured. A teach mode is invoked in the first device 
and a learn mode invoked in the second device. The first 

device receives identification data from the second device, 
such as the model number and software revision number. If 

acceptable, the first device compares individual parameters 
against default values. The first device then sends only 

those parameters which differ from the default values. The 
second device will then load these parameters plus the 

default value of the other parameters. Both devices will 
indicate a successful transfer of data by means of a 

display. If the identification data do not match, the 
first device will provide a prompt and no configuration 

data will be sent to the second device. The devices will 
issue a prompt if after a configuration session has 

occurred, the operator attempts to switch off the power to 

the device to exit the configuration mode or attempts to 
enter the teach mode without first assigning a new 

configuration name. Each device includes a continuously 
powered display for continually displaying that assigned 

multi-character name, even during conditions of power-off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to configuring
biomedical devices, and more particularly, to a system for
configuring multiple biomedical devices identically.Configuration of a single biomedical device, such
as an infusion pump, may take from several minutes to an
hour, or longer, to accomplish. Configuration can involve
setting the maximum infusion rate, setting the air-in-line
alarm threshold level, setting the maximum pressure that
can be applied by the pump, and other parameters. When
several to hundreds of such biomedical devices must be
configured, a significant amount of time is required by
skilled personnel. Typically, a biotechnical engineer on
the hospital staff or available from another source
individually configures each of the biomedical devices as
required. This can result in substantial personnel costs
to the hospital as well as a substantial down time during
which the pumps are undergoing reconfiguration and are
unavailable for use.In many cases, a large number of the same type of
biomedical devices must be configured identically. For
example, all infusion pumps in a neonatal ward may have the
identical alarm threshold levels, identical maximum
infusion rates, and other operational parameters. In the
case where each of the infusion devices used in the ward
must be configured individually, a substantial amount of
time may be required before all pumps are available for
use.An additional consideration is determining what
configuration any particular biomedical device has once it
has been configured. In many cases, it is not apparent
what that configuration is, nor is it easily determinable.
An example for an infusion pump may be the rate range. A
pump configured for a neonatal rate range of from 0.1 to
99.9 ml/hr would be unsuitable for use on an adult in an 
emergency requiring an infusion at a rate greater than 100
ml/hr. In many cases in pumps today, the configuration of
the pump is not apparent unless the pump has been switched
"on." And even when switched on in some such cases, the
rate range is still not discernible by the operator in the
normal operating mode of the device. The rate range limits
can only be known from documentation that may be
accompanying the device or by a service routine to be
performed by a biotechnical engineer.Infusion pumps, as well as other devices, are
often kept in reserve in a "central supply" where they can
be checked out for use as required. Many devices having
different configurations may be shelved together in such a
supply area. It is imperative that
