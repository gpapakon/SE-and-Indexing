<ABSTRACT>
A template and process for drilling and completing multiple wells in a subterranean formation. A template having a plurality of axially extending, divergent bores therethrough is secured to surface or intermdiate casing and a like plurality of subterranean wells are drilled through the bores and into the subterranean formation. Each well is separatly cased to the well head at the surface and separate production tubing is inserted into each well. Thus, remedial operations can be carried out in one well or fluid injected into a subterranean formation via one well while fluid, such as hydrocarbons, are simultaneously produced from a subterranean formation via the other well(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a template and process for drilling
multiple subterranean wells from a single vertical or deviated cased well bore
and for completing such wells via separate casings positioned within the well
bore, and more particularly, to a template and process for drilling and
completing such multiple wells which will permit remedial operations to be
conducted in one well while fluid, such as hydrocarbons, are simultaneously
being produced from a subterranean formation and/or fluid is simultaneously
being injected into the subterranean formation via the other well(s).Increasingly, well bores are being drilled into subterranean formations at
an orientation which is purposely deviated from true vertical by means of
conventional whipstock technology or a mud motor secured in the drill string
adjacent the drill bit. In fractured subterranean formations, deviated wells are
utilized to increase the area of drainage defined by the well within the
subterranean formation, and thus, increase production of hydrocarbons from
the subterranean formation. An inherent problem in utilizing a conventional
whipstock to drill a deviated well is that both the depth and radial orientation of
the whipstock is set when the whipstock is positioned in the well bore and
cannot be changed without retrieving the whipstock from the well bore and
changing the depth and/or radial orientation thereof.In addition, wells drilled from offshore drilling platforms are usually
deviated to increase the number of wells which can be drilled and completed
from a single platform. Offshore drilling platforms which are utilized in deep
water to drill and complete wells in a subterranean formation vary in size,
structure, and cost depending upon the water depth and the loads in which the
platform will be set. For example, a platform may be constructed to be
supported in part by one leg or caisson which extends to the ocean floor or by
as many as eight such legs or caissons. Costs of such offshore drilling 
platforms vary from approximately $5,000,000 to $500,000,000. Each offshore
drilling platform is equipped with a set number of slots via which deviated wells
can be drilled and completed through surface casing which is secured at the
mudline by conventional techniques. Due to the significant capital expenditure
required for these offshore platforms, a need exists for a template and process
for drilling and completing multiple cased wells via a single surface or
intermediate casing.US 2492079 teaches a well bore comprising a
