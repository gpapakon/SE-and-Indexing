<ABSTRACT>
The time-switch has a timer stage (TS) supplied from the mains via a rectifier and filter stage (GL1), its output signal controlling a switch relay (SR) with a working contact inserted in the supply circuit for one or more staircase lights (L1,L2) and operated via at least one manual push-button switch (T1,T2). When the current along the pushbutton line (TL) is above a given value, an electronic bistable circuit (BS) at the output of the supply stage (SG) is switched into a high resistance state, so that a low resistance current path is obtd. across the semiconductors and current limiting resistors (R15,R19,R16) in the pushbutton line.

Stairwell light timer having an a.c. voltage mains
supply, a filter and rectifier circuit (GL1) which

supplies a timing circuit (Z1) of which the timing signal
(TS) is activated by a switching relay (SR) in a manner

determining the switch-over time, and the contact element
(AK) of said switching relay (SR) bridges one of the mains

voltage lines (N, L) with a stairwell light supply line
(LL) which externally supplies one or more stairwell lamps

(L1, L2), and having a momentary-contact signal line (TL)
which is adapted to be connected externally by one or more

momentary-contact switches (T1, T2), respectively
actuated, to a first of the mains voltage lines (N, L),

with which lines, if appropriate, a series connection
consisting of a glow-discharge lamp (G1, G2) and an

associated series resistor (W1, W2) is connected in
parallel in each case, and a start signal (SS) being sent

from the momentary-contact signal line (TL) to the timing
circuit (Z1) each time the momentary-contact switch is

actuated, and between the momentary-contact signal line
(TL) and the respective second of the mains supply lines

(L, N) there is arranged a feeder circuit (SG) for the
glow-discharge lamp(s) (G1, G2),

characterised in that the feeder circuit (SG) consists of
a bridge-connected rectifier circuit (B) of which the d.c.

voltage output (GA) is wired to an electronic bistable
circuit (BS) which is connected in a very highly resistive

state whenever the current flowing via the momentary-contact
signal line (TL) exceeds a preset threshold value,

and which otherwise forms a low-impedance current path
except for forward resistances of semi-conductors and

current limiting resistors (R15, R16) situated in the
current path, and that the timing circuit (Z1) is

retriggerable and is activated via an optical isolator
(ISO) which is activated on the input side from the d.c.

electrode is wired through a progressive-type resistor

(R10) to an intercepting Zener diode (D5) and to a contact
gap of a second transistor (Q2), the base of which is

wired to a voltage divider (R7, R11) which is situated
between the bridge-connected rectifier outputs (GA) and of

which the divider ratio in conjunction with the base-emitter
voltage of the second transistor (Q2) determines

the preset threshold value above which the second

the first switching transistor (Q4) is inhibited.
