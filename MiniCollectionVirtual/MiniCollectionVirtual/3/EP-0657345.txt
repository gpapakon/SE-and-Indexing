<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle gear change mechanism has a front chain sprocket 
assembly (1) with at least two chain sprockets, a drive chain (19), 

a front derailleur (2) mounted to a carrying piece (10), a rear 
chain sprocket assembly (3) with at least two chain sprockets, 

a rear derailleur (4) mounted to a frame part (20), a chain 
straining device (13) including a carrying piece (5) with two 

tension pulleys (6), a parallelogram (7) and a carrying part (8). 
The rear sprocket assembly is provided with a free wheel coupling. 

The arrangement allows a gear shifting by rotating the drive 
chain backwards, that means the opposite direction to the chain 

drive direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method to change the gears of a 
bicycle and the corresponding gear change mechanism to this 
operation.
 
Usually the chain sprocket assembly with a free wheel coupling 
in the back wheel hub is brought in rotation by means of a 
transmission drive chain. While changing a gear, the drive chain 
by means of a derailleur shifts sideways from one sprocket 
to the adjacent one, operation accompanied with a so called 
gear change resistance. The bigger the drive load applied 
to the chain sprocket and the derailleur by the drive chain 
the stronger the gear change resistance.
 
Gear change mechanisms of the above type do not allow a rapid 
gear change when going uphill, as the gear change resistance 
is strong. The US-4127038 publication describes a gear change mechanism 
comprising pivotable chain sprocket parts, operating as a 
front derailleur. The publication 2652426 describes a free 
wheel gear change mechanism, allowing a gear shifting without 
a rotation of the pedals e.g. when going downhill. The inventions 
mentioned above do not solve the problem: a rapid gear 
shifting when driving uphill.
 
The DE-4208713 A1 describes a gear change mechanism which 
could be provided with auxilliary guiding parts to protect the 
chain from eventual axial displacement. The WO-9003305 A1 describes 
a gear change mechanism, which by disengage means 
coupled to the free wheel coupling, enables a gear shifting 
in the driving direction.
 
It is an object of the invention, to apply such a method of 
gear changing, which allows an effective and rapid shifting 
operation, by a relative simple, corresponding gear change mechanism.  A solution to this problem provide the characteristics included 
in claim 1. The gear shifting takes place by rotating 
the pedals backwards and the resulting rotation of the drive 
chain in the free wheel direction, as the rear sprocket assembly 
is provided with a free wheel coupling. The following description related to the drawings explains 
the invention.
 
Fig. 1 is a side view showing a gear change mechanism 
mounted to a bicycle frame.
 
Fig. 2 is a front view of a chain straining device. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a front derailleur 2, 
located opposite to the lower edge of the largest chain 
sprocket, in the area 6 - 9 hours clockwise and mounted 
to a carrying piece 10. This location of the 
derailleur allows a gear shifting by rotating the pedals backwards. 
In this case the invention uses the basic functioning 
principle of a derailleur, for
