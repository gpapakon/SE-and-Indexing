<ABSTRACT>
A fluid-filled cylindrical elastic mount which includes 
radially spaced-apart inner and outer sleeves (12, 14), and 

an elastic body (16) interposed between the inner and outer 
sleeves for elastical connection thereof. The elastic body 

has diametrally opposite fluid chambers (46) containing a 
highly viscous fluid, and at least one fluid passage (48) 

which communicates with the fluid chambers. The outer sleeve 
has at least one inlet (50) through which the highly viscous 

fluid is injected into the mount. Each of the inlets is 
formed in a portion of the outer sleeve which partially 

defines the corresponding fluid passage, and is closed by a 
sealing member (52) fixed to the outer sleeve. The elastic 

mount further includes a pair of restricting protrusions 

(22) which are respectively formed in the fluid chambers to 
protrude from the inner sleeve toward the outer sleeve in 

radially opposite directions, such that each protrusion has 
a radial end face which cooperates with the outer sleeve to 

define a restricted portion (56) which has a predetermined 
radial dimension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid-filled 
cylindrical elastic mount which provides a vibration damping 
effect based on flows of a highly viscous fluid contained 
therein. This elastic mount may be favorably used as a 
suspension bushing for an automobile, for example. As one type of a vibration damper interposed 
between two members of a vibration system, there is known a 
fluid-filled cylindrical elastic mount according to the preamble of claim 1 which mount includes inner 
and outer metallic sleeves that are connected by a 
cylindrical elastic body, as disclosed in Publication No. 
5-47733 of examined Japanese Patent Application. The 
disclosed elastic mount has a pair of fluid chambers which 
are formed by closing pockets formed in the elastic body, 
and which are filled with a fluid having a relatively high 
viscosity. The elastic mount further includes restricting 
protrusions formed in the fluid chambers so as to protrude 
from the inner sleeve toward the outer sleeve, such that 
restricted portions are formed between the protrusions and 
the outer sleeve. When a vibrational load is applied between 
the inner and outer sleeves of the above sylindrical elastic 
mount, the highly viscous fluid is forced to flow in the  
 
restricted portions, so that the mount exhibits a high 
vibration damping effect based on the viscosity resistance 
or shearing stress of the viscous fluid. If the above-described fluid-filled elastic mount 
is assembled within the highly viscous fluid so as to fill 
the fluid chambers with the fluid, in the same manner as 
used for filling a known elastic mount with a lowly viscous 
fluid, a portion of the highly viscous fluid remains on or 
adheres to the surface of the elastic mount, requiring a 
cumbersome procedure for removing the fluid afterwards. 
Accordingly, the filling of the highly viscous fluid is 
generally effected by injecting the fluid into the fluid 
chambers through filler inlets, and then sealing or closing 
the inlets with suitable sealing or closure members, such as 
blind rivets, as disclosed in the above-identified 
publication. In the above case, however, the sealing member 
closing to the injet protrudes into the corresponding fluid 
chamber, and the restricting protrusion in the fluid chamber 
may undesirably abut on the inlet when the elastic mount 
receives a torsional or twisting load which is applied to 
the inner and outer sleeves in the circumferential 
direction. As a result, the sealing member may be damaged 
due to the abutting contact
