<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of invention is that of devices for a deployment of fins of projectiles, especially of the rocket type. The deployment device according to the invention is characterised in that it comprises a torsion spring (9), the axis of which is parallel to the axis (XX') of the projectile. It is arranged in a groove (10) made in a collar (17) of a support (5) integral with the projectile (1), on which collar (17) the fin (7) is mounted, the groove having a width larger than the outside diameter of the spring, making it possible to ensure the guidance of the latter and allowing its ejection after the deployment of the fin. The method is used in the field of anti-tank weapons.

A device to deploy a stabilizing fin (7) of a
projectile (1), comprising a torsion spring (9) whose axis

(YY') is parallel to the projectile axis (XX'), said
device 
characterized in that
 the spring is placed near to
the fin and arranged in a groove (10) made in a support

(5) connected to the projectile and on which the fin (7)
is mounted, one of the ends (12) of the spring being

integral with the support and the other end (11) pressing
against a lower face of the fin (7), said spring (9) being

under torsional stress when the fin is folded back and
therefore exerting a load able to make the fin pivot with

respect to the support so as to deploy it.
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the groove (10) is of a length greater than the

external diametre of the spring (9), thereby enabling it
to be ejected after the deployment of the fin (7).
A device according to any one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that at one of its ends, the spring (9)

has a part (21) bent at 90Â° with an axis parallel to the
spring axis (YY').
A device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the spring (9)is made radially integral with the

support (5) by means of the bent part (21)which penetrates
into an aperture (14) made in the rear face (13) of the

support, said aperture having an axis parallel to the
projectile axis (XX') and being of a greater diametre than

the diametre of the wire constituting the spring, thereby
enabling said spring to be ejected after deployment of the

fin.
A device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the rear face (13) of the support incorporates a

recess (15) connecting the groove (10) to the aperture
(14) and enabling one end (12) of the spring to pass

through, said recess being of a depth and width greater
than the diametre of the wire constituting the spring, 

thereby enabling said spring to be ejected after
deployment of the fin.
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the end (11) of the spring lies in

the vicinity of a collar (17) of the support (5) which
ensures the axial hold (9) of the spring when the fin (7)

is in its folded position.
