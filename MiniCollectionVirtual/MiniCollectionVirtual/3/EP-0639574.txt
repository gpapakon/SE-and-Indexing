<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel thiazolecarboxamide
derivative. More particularly, the present invention relates to
a novel 2-aminothiazolecarboxamide derivative represented by the
following general formula (I):

in which
R1 and R2independently of one another represent hydrogen, (C1-C5)alkyl,
(C1-C5)haloalkyl, (C3-C6)alkenyl, (C3-C6)alkynyl,
(C3-C6)cycloalkyl,

or phenyl or benzyl, each of
which can be substituted with halogen, (C1-C3)alkyl or
nitro;R3represents (C1-C3)alkyl or (C1-C3)haloalkyl;R4represents 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, phenyl,
or benzyl, each of which can be substituted with
halogen, (C1-C6)alkyl or nitro; R5represents cyano or thiocarbamoyl; andR6represents (C1-C6)alkyl, (C3-C6)alkenyl, (C3-C6)cycloalkyl,
or phenyl or benzyl, each of which can be substituted with
halogen, (C1-C3)alkyl or nitro.The present invention also relates to a process for preparing
the compound of formula (I), as defined above, and use of the
compound of formula (I) for controlling phytopathogenic organisms.Fungicidal agents against Oomycetes occupy approximately 25%
of the total fungicide market and have built up a unique market
because Oomycetes is characterized by mycelium having no ergosterol
biosynthesis mechanism. At the present time, conventional
non-systemic fungicidal agents, for example, captan, captafol,
dithiocarbamate, chlorothalonil, etc., have been widely used for
controlling Oomycetes. However, it has been disclosed that such
non-systemic fungicidal agents have only a preventive activity
against Oomycetes but have a serious toxic effect. In the 1970's
acylalanine-based fungicidal agents have been developed as a
systemic fungicide. However, it has been also reported that the
resistance of Oomycetes to such systemic fungicides becomes
gradually aggravated. Further, recently the field of fungicidal
agents against Oomycetes has not achieved any remarkable development.
Accordingly, the development of a novel fungicide against
Oomycetes which has a high fungicidal activity and a low toxicity 
has been strongly desired.To satisfy such requirement, in the latter half of the
1980's dimethomorph was developed and reported as an agent for
controlling causative organisms of late blight and downy mildew
in fruit trees and potatos. In addition, for disinfecting
cereal seeds and controlling causative organisms of rust and smut
metsulfovax represented by the following formula (II) was developed
(see S. African Patent No. 67 06,681) :
Thereafter, the following thiazolecarboxamide-based
