<ABSTRACT>
A torsion axle (10) for a vehicle includes an elongated axle tube (12) enclosing first stage torsion shafts (22) and second stage torsion shafts (34) all having a common axis, and a metal tube (16, 32) and a plurality of resilient rubber rods (26, 36) confine each of the shafts for torsionally resisting rotation of the shaft. Each first stage metal tube is secured to the surrounding axle tube, and each second stage metal tube is connected to the corresponding first stage shaft. A stud (42) projects outwardly from each second stage metal tube through a slot (44) within the surrounding axle tube to limit rotation of the second stage tube with the first stage shaft, and a crank arm (52) and eccentric spindle (56) are secured to the outer end portion of each second stage shaft for receiving a wheel. In modifications, the first stage shafts (72) for both the left and right wheels are connected as one shaft, and a winch cable (106) and spool (104) provide for pre-rotating the one shaft to lower the vehicle for convenient loading.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTIPLE STAGE TORSION AXLEBackground of the InventionIn the art of rubber torsion axles of the general type disclosed in U.S. Patents No.3,208,168 and No.3,436,069 which issued to applicant and are commonly used on trailers and other load carrying vehicles, it is frequently necessary for such vehicles to be transported along the road or highway while empty or at a static load and also be transported with a gross load which is substantially greater than the static load.For example, it is desirable to use such a torsion axle on a trailer with a static load of about two thousand pounds and having a gross load of about six thousand pounds without the trailer or vehicle bouncing or swaying under any loading condition. It is also desirable for the torsion axle to be a simple, economical and dependable in construction and to be easily installed on a vehicle chassis.Summary of the Invention The present invention is directed to an improved torsion axle of the general type mentioned above and which provides multiple stages for use on a trailer or other vehicle adapted to transport a wide range of loads ranging from an empty or static load and a gross load several times that of the static load. The multiple stage torsion axle of the invention also provides the vehicle with a smooth ride under various loading conditions without bouncing and swaying of the vehicle. In addition the torsion axle of the invention is simple and economical in construction and provides for a dependable service life over an extended 

period of time.The above features and advantages are provided in accordance with the invention by a torsion axle including an elongated cylindrical axle tube which mounts on the vehicle chassis and encloses a pair of first stage torsion shafts and a pair of second stage torsion shafts all in axial alignment. A generally square metal tube and a plurality of resilient or rubber rods confine each of the shafts for torsionally resisting rotation of the shaft, and each of the metal tubes for the first stage is connected to the axle tube. Each second stage metal tube is connected to the corresponding first stage shaft, and a crank arm and eccentric spindle are secured to the outer end portion of each of the second shafts for receiving a wheel. In modifications, the first stage shafts for both the left and right wheels are connected together as one shaft, and a winch cable and spool are connected to the one shaft to provide for pre-rotation of the one shaft to lower the vehicle for convenient loading.Other
