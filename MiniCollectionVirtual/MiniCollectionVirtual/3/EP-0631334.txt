<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic motor has a stator (100) having a 
piezoelectric member (102) vibrated by a drive signal, 

and an elastic member for generating a traveling 
vibration wave in a drive surface (P1) thereof upon 

vibration of the piezoelectric member, a rotor (20) 
which is urged against the drive surface of the elastic 

member and is driven by the generated traveling 
vibration wave, a support member (30, 33, 36, 300, 303, 

306, 309, 313) integrally molded on the elastic member, 
and a fixing member for holding the support member. In 

the ultrasonic motor, one end face (P3) of the support 
member is formed at the same level as the drive surface 

(P1) or the junction surface (P2) of the elastic 
member, an electrode (13) of the piezoelectric member 

is grounded through the support member, a plurality of 
holes (312, 316) are regularly formed in the 

circumferential direction of the support member, or the 
support member is fixed to the fixing member by an 

adhesive (400), thereby improving drive efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
motor having high drive efficiency, which causes a
stator to generate a traveling vibration wave, thereby
driving a rotor. More particularly, the present
invention relates to an ultrasonic motor having high
drive efficiency, which causes an elastic member to
generate a traveling vibration wave upon vibration
having a vibration frequency in an ultrasonic range of
a piezoelectric member, thereby driving a rotor.The structure of a conventional ultrasonic motor
is disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-62-77068. Fig. 1 is a
sectional view of the ultrasonic motor. A stator 1 is
constituted by integrally fixing a piezoelectric member
1b to an elastic member 1a. A radial support member 3
is integrally molded on an inner peripheral surface of
the elastic member 1a near a neutral axis of the stator
1 as a whole. The support member 3 has a thin plate
portion 3a provided to the inner peripheral surface of
the elastic member 1a, and a thick portion 3b provided
on the peripheral edge of the thin plate portion 3a and
having a larger thickness than that of the thin plate 
portion 3a. A technique for integrally molding the
support member to the elastic member in this manner is
also disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-59-213286.
The thick portion 3b is fixed in a case 5 which
receives a bearing 4.A flange portion 6a radially projects from the
inner periphery of the rotor 2, and a thick portion 6b
is integrally molded on the peripheral edge of the
flange portion 6a. A compression force by a given
means (not shown) is applied to the thick portion 6b
through a bearing 7, so that a lower surface 8 of the
rotor 2 is urged against a drive surface 1c of the
elastic member 1a.When an AC voltage is applied to the piezoelectric
member 1b, the piezoelectric member 1b causes bending
vibration, and a traveling vibration wave is generated
in the elastic member 1a. This vibration wave
frictionally drives the rotor 2. The generation
mechanism of the traveling vibration wave is described
in detail in JP-A-60-24582, and a description thereof
will be omitted. The structure of a conventional stator is
disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-60-245482. Figs. 5 and 6
show this structure. A stator 10 is constituted by
adhering an annular elastic member 11 and an annular
piezoelectric member 12. A plurality of electrodes 13
(Fig. 6) are formed on the upper surface of the
piezoelectric member 12, and electrodes 14a to 14d are
also formed on its lower surface. The elastic member
11 is adhered to the piezoelectric member 12 so as to
be
