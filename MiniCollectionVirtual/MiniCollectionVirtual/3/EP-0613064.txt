<ABSTRACT>
A developer device is provided with a developer 
vessel for storing therein a developer material composed 

of toner particles and carrier granules. In the developer 
device, a target ratio of toner p
articles for a detected 
quantity of the developer material is computed. In the 

device, a toner concentration detector sensor is also 
provided for detecting the ratio of toner particles in the 

developer vessel. In order to set the detected toner 
ratio of toner particles equal to the target ratio, 

quantity of toner particles to be additionally supplied to 
the developer vessel is controlled. As a result, the 

ratio of toner particles to the developer material stored 
in the developer vessel can be maintained in a 

predetermined ratio, thereby ensuring a desirable image 
quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developer device
according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a method
for controlling the tower concentration in a developer device
according to the preamble of claim 17.Developer devices for visualizing (developing) an
electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of a
photoreceptor using a developer material composed of
carrier granules and toner particles are used, for 
example, in many dry-type copying machines. In such
developer devices, the quantity of the toner particles is
reduced while being used in the developing process;
whereas, the quantity of carrier granules in the developer
material remains the same. Therefore, the quality of the
carrier granules being stirred with toner particles in the
developer material deteriorates because a resin coating
layer on the surface thereof is peeled, or toner particles
adhere onto the surface thereof. As a result, the
charging ability of the developer material gradually
deteriorates.A device which prevents the deterioration of the
charging ability by supplying additional carrier granules
separately from the refill for the used toner particles
has been disclosed (see, for example, Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 21591/1990 (Tokukouhei 2-21591)).
In such a device, when adding additional carrier granules,
excessive developer material in the developer vessel is
discharged through a discharge opening formed on the wall
of the developer vessel to be collected in a waste
container. By repeating the above refill and discharge of
the developer material, the developer material in the
developer vessel whose charging ability has deteriorated
can gradually be replaced. Thus, the required charging
ability of the developer material can be restored, and the 
deterioration in the copied image quality can be
prevented.However, when the carrier granules are additionally
supplied to the developer material little by little, the
quantity of developer material in the developer vessel is
likely to change, and thus the ratio of toner particles to
the developer material cannot be accurately controlled.
Therefore, the above device presents the problem that it
is difficult to ensure a desirable image quality.In the above device, additional toner particles are
supplied by detecting the ratio of toner particles in the
developer vessel, for example, using the toner
concentration sensor composed of a magnetic permeability
sensor. In the case where carrier granules remain in the
developer material without being additionally supplied nor
disch
