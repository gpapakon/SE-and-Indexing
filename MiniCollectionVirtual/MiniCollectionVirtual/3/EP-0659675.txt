<ABSTRACT>
Device for loading and unloading cops in textile apparatus for winding 
yarn of the type comprising a cop-holder arm (18) suitable for picking 

up a cop, supporting it during the yarn winding operation and 
transferring it at the end of the operation of yarn winding; the device 

comprises a guide element (34) for the sliding of the cops which 
extends from the area of pick-up and transfer of said cops and which 

moves and can be positioned, driven by suitable drive means (42), in a 
first upper position wherein it defines a loading guide (30) for empty 

cops (12) and in a second lower position wherein it defines a unloading 
guide (32) for full cops. Means (45) are also provided for stopping and 

positioning said empty cops (12) sliding on the loading guide (30) of the 
empty cops in a suitable position for pick-up by the cop-holder arm (18) 

of the textile machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the loading and unloading
of cops in textile apparatus for winding yarn. The known devices for
loading and feeding cops to textile winding apparatus comprise,
essentially, a support structure, a first fixed guide for loading cops
towards a respective area for pick-up of the cops by suitable arms of the
winding machine, and a second fixed guide for unloading the cops
which extends from a second area for transfer of the cops loaded with
yarn by the arms of the winding machine.In these known devices the cops, empty and full respectively, are fed
and moved away by exploiting the force of gravity, tilting said loading
and unloading guides from the work area of the reels upwards, in order
to allow sliding towards the pick-up area of the empty cops, and
downwards respectively, to allow sliding away from the winding
machine of the cops loaded with yarn, with said cop loading guide
which is provided in a position above said cop unloading guide and on
the side of the machine opposite the latter.Such a type of device for loading and unloading cops and textile 
winding apparatus is disadvantageous from various viewpoints.First of all attention should be drawn to the problem of bulk posed by
traditional loading and unloading devices; the fact that chutes or
guides for sliding of the cops to be loaded or unloaded are provided and
which extend on opposite sides starting from different work areas of the
textile machine involves excessive use of space which always
represents a problem for all those machines which have to be placed
inside industrial buildings which have already been set up.Moreover, the fact that said cop loading guide or chute is provided on
the front side of the machine is disadvantageous, in that it takes up
space intended instead for other work devices of the winding machine
which must necessarily be provided in the front position of the machine
between the yarn guide parts and the reel for collecting yarn.A feed and guide chute provided in front of the winding machine also
interferes with the manoeuvres of the operators in charge of the
machine who must deal with the initial operations of inserting the yarn
and maintenance of the other devices of the winding machine.Additionally, said front chutes must necessarily be of limited length
since otherwise they would impede the operators' work excessively
and could interfere with other functions of the winding machine, for
example the function of guiding the yarn towards the winding sections. The fact that
