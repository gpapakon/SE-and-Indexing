<ABSTRACT>
A sensor (100) is proposed which is used to construct a microscope which is based on atomic forces and supplies a representation of the forces in up to three components. The sensor (100) is constructed in such a way that different vibrational modes (transverse and torsional) can be stimulated individually, and each mode corresponds to a force direction.

Sensor for imaging a surface structure by force 
measurement, 


with a measurement probe (12) comprising a measurement 
tip, 
with an arm (11) on which the measurement probe is 
mounted, whereby the measurement probe is induced to 

vibration in the vicinity of the surface to be imaged and 
the influence on the vibrations by the surface is 

measured, 
whereby the sensor comprises two transversal vibration 
modes and one torsional vibration mode, and that the tip 

of the probe (12) in each of the three vibration modes 
vibrates in one respective direction, whereby the three 

directions are orthogonal to each other and one vibration 
direction represents the direction of the tip of the 

probe, 
whereby the sensor comprises two transversal vibration 
modes and one torsional vibration mode, and that the tip 

of the probe (12) in each of the three vibration modes 
vibrates in one respective direction, whereby the three 

directions are orthogonal to each other and one vibration 
direction represents the direction of the tip of the 

probe, 
and whereby the sensor is mechanically designed such that 
the resonance frequencies of the individual vibration 

modes are separated from one another, and 
with a piezoelectric element that excites the three 
vibration modes individually by different excitation 

frequencies.

Method for imaging surfaces, characterized in that a 
sensor in accordance with any one of the Claims 1 to 5 is 

induced to vibration successively in different modes and 
the change in the resonant frequency due to the 

interaction of the sensor probe with the surface is 
measured. 
Method in accordance with Claim 6, characterized in that 
the change in the resonant frequency is conducted using a 

heterodyne laser measurement method.
