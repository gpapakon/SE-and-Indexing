Compound corresponding to the general formula
(I)



in which

n represents the number 0 or 1,
R
1
 represents a methyl group, in which case
R
2
 represents a phenoxy(C
1
-C
4
)alkyl group (in which
the phenoxy group optionally carries 1 or 2

substituents chosen from halogen atoms and methoxy and
ethoxy groups), or else R
1
 and R
2
 together form, and
with the nitrogen atom which carries them, a

4-(phenoxymethyl)piperid-1-yl group (in which the
phenoxy group optionally carries 1 or 2 C
1
-C
4
 alkyl
groups) or a 4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl group (in which the

phenyl group optionally carries 1 or 2 substituents
chosen from halogen atoms and methoxy and ethoxy groups

and C
1
-C
4
 alkyl groups),
R
3
 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group,
R
4
 represents a hydrogen atom,
R
5
 represents a hydrogen atom or a group of general
formula


R
6
 being a hydrogen atom, a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group,
a 4-carbamoylpyrimidin-2-yl group or a 5-carbamoylpyrazin-2-yl

group,

in the form of the base or of an addition salt with an
acid.
Process for the preparation of compounds
according to Claim 1, characterized in that an amine of

general formula (II)


(in which R
1
 and R
2
 are as defined above), optionally in
the salt form, is reacted with a halogenated reactant

of general formula (III)


(in which Y represents a halogen atom, n is as defined
in Claim 1 and either R
3
 is as defined in Claim 1 and R
7

represents a triphenylmethyl group or R
3
 and R
7
 together
form, and with the nitrogen atom which carries them, a

phthalimido group) in an aprotic solvent, in the
presence of an inorganic base, at a temperature of 40

to 80°C,

thus obtaining a diamine of general formula (IV)


the end alkylamine of which is deprotected: in the case
where R
7
 is a triphenylmethyl group, a treatment with
gaseous hydrochloric acid in an aliphatic alcohol at a

temperature of 0 to 60°C is carried out; in the case
where R
3
 and R
7
 together form a phthalimido group, a
treatment with hydrazine is carried out,

thus obtaining an amine of general formula (V) 


which is reacted with 2-chloropyrazine-5-carboxamide in
an aprotic solvent, in the presence of a base, at a

temperature of 20 to 40°C,

thus obtaining a 2-aminopyrazine-5-carboxamide
derivative of general formula (Ia)



which corresponds to the general formula (I) when R
4
 and
R
5
 each represent a hydrogen atom,

then, in order to prepare the compounds of general
formula (I) in which R
5
 represents a group of general
formula



the amide of general formula (Ia) is converted to an
ester of general formula (VII)



(in which R
8
 represents a C
1
-C
4
 alkyl group) by reaction
with a C
1
-C
4
 aliphatic alcohol, in the presence of an
acid, at a temperature of 0 to 60°C, then the ester thus

obtained is reacted with a diamine of general formula
(VIII)



(in which R
6
 represents a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group)
in an aliphatic alcohol, at a temperature of 0 to 100°C, 

thus obtaining a compound of general formula (Ib)


in which R
6
 represents a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group,
then, in order to prepare the compounds of general

formula (Ib) in which R
6
 represents a 4-carbamoylpyrimidin-2-yl
or 5-carbamoylpyrazin-2-yl group, the

compound obtained above is deprotected with trifluoroacetic
acid in dichloromethane in order to obtain a

compound of general formula (Ib) where R
6
 represents
hydrogen, and the latter is reacted with

2-chloropyrimidine-4-carboxamide or 2-chloropyrazine-5-carboxamide,
in an aprotic solvent, in the presence of

a base, at a temperature of 20 to 40°C.
Medicament, characterized in that it consists
of a compound according to Claim 1.
Pharmaceutical composition, characterized in
that it contains a compound according to Claim 1, in

combination with an excipient.
Compound corresponding to the general formula
(VII)



in which n, R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 are as defined in Claim 1 and
R
8
 represents a C

-C
4
 alkyl group, as an essential
intermediate in the process according to Claim 2.
