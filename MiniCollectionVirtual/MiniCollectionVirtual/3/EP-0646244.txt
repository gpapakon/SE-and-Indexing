<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an immunoassay for thrombin-antithrombin complex in a human fluid sample. The assay comprises reaction of a human fluid sample with at least two antibodies or immunoreactive fragments thereof, wherein at least one of the antibodies binds to thrombin-antithrombin III complex in the sample, but exhibits essentially no cross-reactivity with antithrombin III and complexes of antithrombin III with other serine proteaste factors.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOASSAY AND TEST KIT FOR THROMBIN-ANTITHROMBIN III COMPLEXBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates an immunoassay for thrombiπ- antithrombin III complex which comprises antibodies that specifically bind to the complex in a human fluid sample.2. BackgroundGeneral agreement exists that blood coagulation or clotting includes three essential steps: 1 ) a complex of substances called prothrombin activator is formed, e.g. in response to rupture of a blood vessel or damage to blood itself; 2) the prothrombin activator catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin; and 3) thrombin acts as an enzyme to activate platelets and to convert fibrogen into fibrin threads that enmesh platelets, blood cells and plasma to form the clot itself.The enzymatic activity of thrombin can be regulated in various ways, including the formation of an inactive complex with antithrombin III, known as the thrombin-antithrombin III complex or the "TAT complex". Antithrombin III, or "ATIII", is a proteinase inhibitor in plasma that complexes with several serine proteinases in addition to thrombin. Thus ATIII is known to form complexes with serine protease factors Xlla, Xla, Xa and IXa.It is desirable to measure the amount of TAT complex in a human fluid sample. Determination of levels of the TAT complex will provide an 

indication of coagulation activity of a patient and aid in the assessment of thrombotic risk and other disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation.An assay for TAT complex levels in human plasma should provide a selective assessment of TAT complex concentrations, rather than a measurement of the concentration of total complexes of ATIII in a plasma sample, e.g. complexes of ATIII with factors Xlla, XIa, Xa and IXa in addition to the TAT complex. Such measurement of the "total" complexes of ATIII provides an indication of the equilibrium of several reactions, some of which may reflect conditions other than those associated with particular TAT complex levels. For instance, contact activation of factors XII and XI may lead predominantly to activation of the complement and kiπin systems, therefore Xlla-ATIII and Xla-ATIII complexes may not be indicative of thrombotic risk.It thus would be desirable to have a means for determining levels of the TAT complex in a human fluid sample. It would be particularly desirable to have an assay for the concentration of TAT complex in a human fluid sample where the assay provided a selective assessment of concentrations of
