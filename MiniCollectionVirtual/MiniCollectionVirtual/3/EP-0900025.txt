<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the
outer membrane protein-106 (OMP106) polypeptide of Moraxella
catarrhalis. The invention encompasses a purified OMP106
polypeptide and polypeptides derived therefrom (OMP106-derived
polypeptides). The invention also encompasses
antibodies, including cytotoxic antibodies, that specifically
bind the OMP106 polypeptide and/or OMP106-derived
polypeptides. The invention further encompasses prophylactic
or therapeutic compositions, including vaccines, that
comprise OMP106 polypeptide and/or OMP106-derived
polypeptides. The invention additionally provides methods of
inducing immune responses to M. catarrhalis in mammals. The
invention further provides isolated nucleotide sequences
encoding the OMP106 polypeptide and OMP106-derived
polypeptides, vectors having said sequences, and host cells
containing said vectors.Moraxella catarrhalis, also known as Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis or Branhamella catarrhalis
and formerly known as Neisseria catarrhalis or Micrococcus
catarrhalis, is a gram-negative bacterium frequently found in
the respiratory tract of humans. M. catarrhalis, originally
thought to be a harmless commensal organism, is now
recognized as an important pathogen in upper and lower
respiratory tract infections in animals. In humans, M.
catarrhalis causes serious lower respiratory tract infections
in adults with chronic lung disease, systemic infections in
immunocompromised patients, and otitis media and sinusitis in
infants and children. See Helminen et al., 1993, Infect.
Immun. 61:2003-2010; Catlin, B. W., 1990, Clin. Microbiol.
Rev. 3:293-320; and references cited therein. The outer surface components of Moraxella catarrhalis
have been studied in attempts to understand the pathogenic
process of M.catarrhalis infections and to develop useful
therapeutic treatments and prophylactic measures against
such infections. The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) in
particular have received considerable attention as possible
virulence factors and as potential vaccine antigens. M.
catarrhalis has about 10 to 20 different OMPs with 6 to 8
of these, OMPs A to H, as the predominate species (Murphy
and Loeb, 1989, Microbial Pathogen. 6:159-174). The
molecular weights of OMPs A to H range from 97 to 20 kD,
respectively. See Bartos and Murphy, 1988, J. Infect. Dis.
158:761-765; Helminen et al., 1993, Infect. Immun. 61:2003-2010;
