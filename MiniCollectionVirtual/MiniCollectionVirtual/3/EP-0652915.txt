<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to elastomeric compositions 
used in hot-melt formulations that contain an elastomer 
and an amorphous propylene/hexene copolymer. This 
invention also relates to adhesively bonded articles 
such as construction components of diapers. Elastomeric compositions are well known and have 
been used in the industry for various applications such 
as adhesives, caulks, and sealants. These compositions 
typically contain an elastomer, a resin, a process oil, 
and optionally a filler. The most costly component of 
these compositions is the elastomer. Therefore, 
compositions containing reduced amounts of elastomer to 
produce lower cost formulations would be very desirable 
and have been attempted in the industry. These lower 
cost formulations containing lower amounts of elastomer 
typically have increased amounts of filler or process 
oil and/or additional polymers such as low molecular 
weight polybutenes. However, these lower cost 
formulations typically have lower performance 
illustrated by poor creep resistance, low peel adhesion 
low tensile strength and/or poor weathering performance. It would, therefore, be very desirable to produce 
low cost elastomeric formulations such as adhesives 
containing reduced amounts of elastomer while retaining 
the performance of formulations containing the high 
amounts of elastomer.  
 The present invention is directed to unique 
compositions containing an elastomer and an amorphous 
propylene/hexene copolymer. These compositions are 
useful in adhesive formulations used to adhesively bond 
substrates such as used in diaper construction and 
contain a reduced amount of elastomer while retaining 
and/or improving performance properties such as peel 
adhesion and creep (delamination) resistance. These 
compositions comprise: 
(a) up to 90 wt. %, based on (a) plus (b), of an 
amorphous propylene/hexene copolymer, 
containing at least 20 wt. % propylene; (b) at least 10 wt. %, based on (a) plus (b), of 
an elastomer selected from styrene butadiene 
styrene block copolymers and optionally 
contains up to 70 wt. % of a tackifier and up 
to 30 wt. % of a process oil. The applicant has unexpectedly discovered that the 
amorphous propylene/hexene copolymer extends the 
elastomer, partially replacing the elastomer in the 
formulation while retaining and/or improving performance 
properties such as enhanced peel adhesion and creep 
resistance. These elastomeric compositions have been 
discovered to be particularly useful, due to their good 
performance
