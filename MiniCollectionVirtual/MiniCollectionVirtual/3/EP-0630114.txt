<ABSTRACT>
A low power optional inverter uses P-channel and N-channel 
transistors in series as in a conventional CMOS inverter, but 

in one embodiment connects complementary signals to the sources 
of the P-channel and N-channel transistors. Therefore, when 

the complementary signals are switched the circuit switches 
between an inverting and a non-inverting buffer. In the non-inverting 

mode, there is negligible current drain upon 
switching because in this mode the circuit does not include a 

standard CMOS inverter, and there is no conducting path from 
power to ground when input voltage is in the range of 2 to 3 

volts. In one embodiment, in the noninverting mode, at least 
one bypass transistor between the optional inverter input and 

output is turned on, and power is not supplied to the inverter. 
In yet another embodiment, in the inverting mode a CMOS 

inverter is powered with conventional voltages and in the 
noninverting mode the CMOS inverter is disabled and a bypass 

transistor connects input to output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low power optional inverter, 
usable as a programmable inverter for a programmable logic 
device. This application is related to the following U.S. 
patents which are incorporated herein by reference: 
1. U.S. Patent 5,291,079, entitled "CONTROL UNIT 
FOR PROGRAMMING A FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY AND 
READING ARRAY STATUS" 2. U.S. Patent 5,319,254, entitled "LOGIC CELL 
WHICH CAN BE CONFIGURED AS A LATCH WITHOUT STATIC ONE'S 
PROBLEM". In a programmable logic device there is need for an 
optional inverter, that is, a circuit which can either pass a 
signal in its non-inverted form or can invert the signal, as 
selected by a user. Reference is now made to Figures 1 & 2 of the 
accompanying drawings which show prior art optional 
inverters. In Fig. 1, P-channel transistor T1 and N-channel 
transistor T2 form a standard CMOS inverter. Memory cell M1 
provides complementary signals which control pass-gate 
transistors T3 and T4 such that circuit 101 provides either 
the non-inverted input signal through transistor T3 or the 
inverted input signal through transistor T4. In a 5-volt 
system, when input line IN carries about 5 volts, transistor 
T2 is on and transistor T1 is off. Thus the inverted output 
line INV is connected to ground or O volts. In either case 
there is no path from VCC to ground through transistors T1 
and T2 because one of them is off. However, transistor 
characteristics are usually chosen so that when the input 
signal on line IN is switching through the range of 2 to 3 
volts, both transistors T1 and T2 are partly on and there is 
a current path from power to ground. Even when the non-inverted  
 
path through transistor T3 has been chosen, the CMOS 
inverter formed by transistors T1 and T2 causes a current 
drain when the input signal is switching, or when the input 
voltage is between 2 volts and 3 volts, which may be the case 
when the input terminal is floating. Other optional inverters are known. Fig. 2 shows 
another prior art optional inverter in which transistors T1 
and T2 of a standard CMOS inverter generate the complement of 
the input signal on line IN. When the signal on line IN is 
about 5 volts, transistor T7 is on and the inverter signal 
from memory cell M1 is provided as the output signal on line 
OUT. When the signal on line IN is about 0 volts, transistor 
T8 is on, and provides the non-inverted signal from memory 
cell M1 to line OUT. If memory cell M1 carries a logic 0 
value, the circuit  
 
of Fig. 2 is a non-inverting buffer, while
