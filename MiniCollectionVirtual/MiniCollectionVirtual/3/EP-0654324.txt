<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable angle vice that is movably adjustable in 
four different directions or coordinates. The vice has an 

upper frame, including clamping faces carried thereby, that 
is carried by a base frame. The upper frame is pivotably 

joined to the base frame for pivotal movement of the upper 
frame in a pivotal direction. The upper frame is further 

joined to the base frame, so that the upper frame sliding 
moves relative to the base frame in a first horizontal 

direction. The base frame is rotatably carried by an 
upstanding rod, so that the vice, including the upper frame, 

may be rotationally moved in a rotational direction. The rod 
is slidingly joined to the base frame, so the the vice, 

including the upper frame may be slidingly moved in a second 
horizontal direction. Finally, rotational movement of the 

rod also vertically moves the upper frame in a vertical 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to adjustable angle vices and, in particular, to
adjustable angle vices that are simultaneously adjustable in a plurality of directions
positioning and working on a workpiece.Vices for clamping workpieces often utilise drills that are driven along
longitudinal axes of the drill. With such drills (except during heavy-duty working),
the workpieces are held steady with manpower while the drill itself is moved
horizontally. Use of such an arrangement can be quite limited, especially when large
or irregularly shaped workpieces are involved.Other devices of which I am aware include two-way vices that provide for
positive positioning of a vice in two co-ordinates.US-A-2502784 (Fahlander) describes a vice having adjustable jaws movable
relative to each other. In particular, Fahlander discloses an adjustable angle vice for
clamping a workpiece and comprising a foot plate, a base frame and an upper frame;
the upper frame including at least one pair of clamping jaws, at least one of said
clamping jaws being movable against the other for the selective clamping and
unclamping of workpiece therebetween, the upper frame being supported by the base
frame, firstly by means of a pair of pivots, and secondly by means of pair of lateral
struts pivotally secured to the base frame and respective pivot points and including
respective trackways each accommodating a slide fixed to the upper frame and slidably
in said trackway when the upper frame is pivoted about said pivot points, said slides
being further adapted to aiding and fixing and securing the upper frame in the pivoted
position selected; base frame being rotatably supported by the foot plate for
rotational movement of the base frame about a vertical axis relative to the foot plate,
and the latter being connected to a foot support.The object of the present invention is the provision of an adjustable angle vice
that may be moved in a plurality of different directions (co-ordinates) for the clamping
and moving of a workpiece. It is a further object of the present invention to provide such an adjustable
angle vice that may be moved in pivotal and rotational directions (co-ordinates), as
well as 
in a first horizontal direction (co-ordinate) and a second horizontal direction (co-ordinate).It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such an adjustable
angle vice that may further move in a vertical direction (co-ordinate), so as to provide for
vertical adjustability of the vice. 
In order to achieve these objects, adjustable

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable angle vice for clamping a workpiece comprising a foot plate, a base
frame (108) and an upper frame (101);


the upper frame (101) including at least one pair of clamping faces (104, 105) at
least one of said clamping faces (104) being movable towards the other (105) for the

selective clamping and unclamping of workpieces therebetween, the upper frame being
supported by the base frame (108) firstly by means of a pair of pivots (125, 126) and

secondly by means of a pair of lateral struts (123, 124) pivotally secured to the base frame
(108) at respective pivot points and including respective trackways each accommodating

a slide fixed to the upper frame (101) and slidable in said trackway when the upper frame
(101) is pivoted about said pivot points, said slides further being adapted to aid in fixing

and securing the upper frame (101) in the pivoted position selected; and
the base frame (108) being rotatably supported by the foot plate for rotational
movement of the base frame (108) about a vertical axis relative to the foot plate, the latter

being secured to a support,

characterised in that the base frame (108) has a pair of substantially parallel

longitudinal trackways (121, 122) formed therein,
the pivots (125, 126) connecting the upper frame (101) to the base frame (108) are
slidably received in said longitudinal trackways (121, 122) of the base frame (108) such

that the upper frame (101) is slidable in a first horizontal direction relative to the base
frame (108) and to said struts, whereby the slides (126) are sliding in the trackways of the

struts (123, 124);
the base frame (108) further has location apertures (127, 128) for mounting the
base frame (108) on the foot plate, each aperture forming a single mounting position in

which longitudinal sliding adjustment is prevented and the foot plate further has an
internally threaded boss, and
a vertical, upstanding rod the lower end of which is threaded for rotatable
engagement with the boss of the foot plate and the upper end of which carries a rotatable

lug, said lug being received in one of the apertures (127, 128) of the base frame (108) so 
that rotation of the rod in the boss vertically moves the rod for causing vertical movement

of the base frame (108) carrying the upper frame (101) and the clamping faces (104, 105).
An adjustable angle vice according to claim 1, characterised in that sliding pivots
(125, 126) and the upper frame (101) include indicia thereon for visually indicating the

pivotal position of the upper frame (101) including the clamping jaws (104, 105) carried
thereby.
An adjustable angle vice according to claim 1, characterised in that the foot plate

An adjustable angle vice for clamping a workpiece comprising a foot plate, a base
frame (108) and an upper frame (101);

movement of the base frame (108) about a vertical axis relative to the foot plate, the latter

being secured to a support,

characterised in that the upper frame is supported by the base frame (108) without
the use of lateral struts between the base frame (108) and the upper frame;
the base frame (108) farther has a longitudinal trackway (133) facing the foot plate
for mounting the base frame (108) on the foot plate, and the foot plate further has an

internally threaded boss, and
a vertical, upstanding rod the lower end of which is threaded for rotatable
engagement with the boss of the foot plate and the upper end of which carries a rotatable

lug, said lug being received in the trackway (133) of the base frame (108) so that rotation
of the rod in the boss vertically moves the rod for causing vertical movement of the base

frame (108) carrying the upper frame (101) and the clamping jaws (104, 105).
