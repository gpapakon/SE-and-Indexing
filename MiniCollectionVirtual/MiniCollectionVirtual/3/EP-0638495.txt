<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus (30) comprises 
sheet containing means (50) for stacking and supporting 

sheets (P), and sheet supplying means (37) for feeding out the 
sheet (P1) contained in the sheet containing means (50) by 

applying a feeding force to the sheet (P1). Sheet containing 
means (50) includes a shiftable intermediate plate (56) on which 

the sheets (P) are stacked and a plurality of pressurizing 
means (65a,59) for biasing the intermediate plate (56) toward the 

sheet supplying means (37) to urge the sheets (P) stacked on 
the intermediate plate (56) against the sheet supplying 

means (37), and said  plurality of pressurizing means (65a,59) 
comprise first pressurising means (65a) for constantly biasing said 

plate (56) and second pressurising means (59) 
capable of being switched between a plate biasing condition and a 

non-biasing condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet supplying apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1.From the document DE-A-29 39 342 a sheet supplying apparatus of
this kind is known which comprises a sheet supporting means and
a sheet supplying means consisting of a shiftable plate on
which the sheets are stacked and a plurality of pressurizing
elements for biasing the plate toward the sheet supplying
means. The pressurizing elements are a first spring for
constantly biasing the plate and a second spring which can be
switched from a non-biasing condition to a biasing condition
via a thread when larger recording mediums with a
correspondingly higher weight are used as a recording material.In view of this state of the art, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a sheet supplying apparatus,
wherein a smooth sheet supply can be effected and a better
operability of the apparatus is achieved by extending an
adjustemnt range of an urging force against an intermediate
supporting plate.This object is achieved by a sheet supplying apparatus having
the features according to claim 1. Therefore, the sheet supplying apparatus according to the invention comprises:
sheet supporting means for supporting sheets;
andsheet supplying means for feeding out a sheet
supported in the sheet supporting means, the sheet
supporting means including a shiftable plate on which
the sheets are stacked and a plurality of pressurizing
means for biasing the plate toward the sheet
supplying means to generate sheet supplying pressure between
the sheets stacked on the plate and the sheet
supplying means; wherein
the pressurizing means comprises first
pressurizing means for constantly biasing the plate,
and second pressurising means capable of being
switched between a plate-biasing condition and a non-biasing
condition,
wherein
the sheet supporting means is inserted to a sheet
supplying position to supply the sheet, and is retracted
from the sheet supplying position by being guided by guide
means,the second pressurising means is switched by
switching means to the non-biasing condition
when the sheet supporting means is retracted from the
sheet supplying position, and is switched to the plate
biasing condition when the sheet supporting means is
inserted to the sheet supplying position.More particularly, the second pressurizing
means biases the intermediate plate when the sheet
supplying means is in a sheet supplying condition,
and does not bias the intermediate plate when the sheet
supplying means is in a non-sheet supplying
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
