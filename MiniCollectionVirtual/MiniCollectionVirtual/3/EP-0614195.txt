<ABSTRACT>
Zirconium alloy nuclear fuel rods (20) are 
protected from fretting damage due to debris captured by 

the fuel assembly (34) and agitated against the fuel rod 
(20) at and below the bottom supporting grid (32) of the 

fuel assembly (34). This is accomplished by preliminarily 
forming a thickened oxide layer (24) in the area to be 

protected, more particularly by heating the rod (20) in an 
oxygen-containing atmosphere and thereby forming a thickened 

zirconium oxide (ZrO₂) surface layer (24) between the 
bottom grid (32) and the end (42) of the fuel rod (20). 

The thicker portion (24) can be 3 to 9 microns in thickness, 
extending four to eight inches from the end (42) of 

the tube, to a point (26) at which the rod (20) is supported 
by a receptacle in the bottom grid (32). The portion 

(24) to be protected is heated to a temperature of 750 to 
1,600°F (400 to 870°C) for up to one hour, for example by 

electromagnetic induction heating, furnace heating, electrical 
resistance heating and/or heating by application of 

laser radiation. The portion (24) can be enclosed in a 
vessel (54) during heating, in a gaseous environment with 

a gaseous pressure and/or oxygen concentration greater than 
normal atmospheric, or in oxygen with an inert gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of nuclear fuel
rod structures. In particular, the invention involves
application of a hard, dense and wear-resistant layer of
zirconium oxide (ZrO2) to a zirconium-based alloy fuel
cladding for improving resistance to fretting caused by
debris lodged in a nuclear fuel assembly. The ZrO2 layer is
thermally grown in situ along at least the end portion of
the fuel rod at and adjacent the lower grid of the fuel
assembly and substantially reduces fretting damage.Fuel reliability is among the highest priorities
in operation of a pressurized water nuclear power plant.
In such a plant, coolant water is heated in a pressure
vessel disposed along a primary coolant circuit by nuclear
fuel in the form of elongated fuel rods arranged in vertical
arrays in fuel assemblies. Each fuel rod comprises
cylindrical pellets of enriched uranium stacked in a hollow
tube typically made of a zirconium alloy. The fuel rods
are grouped in fuel assembly structures that enable a
number of the fuel rods to be handled as a unit. The fuel
assemblies are mounted in the reactor vessel with the fuel
rods elongated vertically and closely spaced. The fuel
rods produce heat with nuclear fission at a rate that is
controlled via neutron absorbing control rods that are
inserted or removed from positions in the fuel assemblies.
The fuel rods heat the primary coolant, producing a vigorous
and turbulent upward flow of the coolant over the fuel
rods due to convection. The fuel rod cladding material is typically a
zirconium alloy such as Zircaloy. Zirconium is particularly
useful because of its ready availability, good ductility,
resistance to radiation damage, low thermal-neutron
absorption cross section, and excellent corrosion resistance
in pressurized water up to 350°C. Zirconium is a
highly active metal that, like aluminum, seems passive
because a stable and cohesive thin oxide film forms on the
surface in the presence of air or water.The oxide film chemically protects the zirconium
metal. In the event of mechanical damage, oxide forms in
the damaged area, provided oxygen is present to sustain the
reaction. In US Patent 4,100,020 - Andrews, a nuclear fuel
rod is provided with a coating of a transition metal oxide
on the inside of the fuel rod cladding tube. During
operation of the power plant, thermal expansion of the fuel
pellets and chemical reaction with iodine released by the
fuel, tend to wear the inner surface of the tube. The
transition metal oxide releases oxygen to ensure that
oxygen will remain
