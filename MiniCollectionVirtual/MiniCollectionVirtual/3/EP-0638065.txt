<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for preparing 3- and/or 5-substituted 
anthranilic acids from 6 and/or 8-substitued quinolin-4-one derivatives. 
More particularly, the present invention concerns a process for preparing 3- and/or 
5-substituted anthranilic acids by the basic tert-butyl hydroperoxide oxidation of 6-and/or 
8-substituted 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones and of 6- and/or 8-substituted 
quinolin-2,4-diones. Substituted anthranilic acid derivatives are useful intermediates in the 
manufacturing of a variety of chemical products including agricultural chemicals; see, for 
example, U.S. Patent 4,954,163. The direct electrophilic substitution of anthranilates to 3- and/or 5-substituted 
analogs is often not very successful because of the mixtures produced. 
Chlorination of methyl anthranilate, for example, gives mixtures of 5-chloroanthranilate 
and 3-chloroanthranilate along with substantial amounts of 
dichlorination. 
Because of the unpredictability with respect to electrophilic 
substitutions, other approaches to substituted anthranilates are usually advocated. For 
example, U.S. Patent 4,306,074 discloses the preparation of a mixture of alkyl 3-chloroanthranilate 
and alkyl 6-chloroanthranilate in a 3:1 ratio from 3-chlorophthalic 
anhydride by amination, Hofmann degradation and esterification. 
 
Despite three discrete steps, a mixture is still produced. In U.S. Patent 4,310.677, alkyl anthranilates are prepared by reacting  
 
an isatin with an alcohol and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an alkali metal 
alkoxide. 
 
However, the isatins required for this approach are often very difficult to prepare. Therefore, it is desirable to have a process for preparing anthranilic 
acids, particularly 3- and/or 5-substituted anthranilic acids, in good yield and free of 
isomeric byproducts from readily available starting materials. We have now found that 2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-ones and quinolin-2,4-diones, 
which can be easily prepared from readily available starting materials, can be converted to 
anthranilic acids by oxidation with tert-butyl hydroperoxide under basic conditions. The 
products are obtained in good yield, free of isomeric byproducts. Therefore, the present 
invention concems a process for the preparation of an anthranilic acid of formula I 
 
wherein 
X and Y independently represent H, halogen, CF3 or a C1-C4 alkyl group,  
which is characterized by contacting a quinolin-4-one of formula II 
 
wherein 
A represents 
 
and X and Y are as previously defined,  
with t-butyl
