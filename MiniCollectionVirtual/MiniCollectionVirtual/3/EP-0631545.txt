<ABSTRACT>
An air bag module (50) comprising an inflator (40) for generating inflation gas; an air bag (12) disposed about the inflator to receive the inflation gas exiting the inflator; a structure (52) for supporting at least the inflator. The inflator comprises: a pressure vessel (42) and a plurality of exit ports (16). The exit ports are arranged to render the inflator in a thrust neutral condition when the inflator is not attached to the structure. A plug (60) or plugs is provided for closing a designated set of exit ports to render the inflator in a non-thrust neutral condition when supported by the structure. Each plug is received in each of the designated exit ports and is preferably received through a portion of the structure such that if the inflator is removed from the structure each plug must also be removed, thereby opening all of previously closed exit ports and rendering the inflator in its thrust neutral condition once again.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
supplemental inflatable restraint (air bag) systems 
and more particularly to a hybrid inflator. A hybrid inflator comprises a pressure vessel 
into which is stored a quantity of inert, pressurized 
gas. Means are provided to selectively open a passage 
leading from the pressure vessel to exit ports to 
permit the egress of the inflation gas. Such means 
typically includes a mechanism for braking a 
rupturable disk. Hybrid inflators may also include 
heat generators, such as a quantity of propellent, to 
heat the gas remaining in the pressure vessel thereby 
achieving a more efficient inflation of the air bag. 
It is a requirement that the orientation of the exit 
ports be arranged to maintain the hybrid inflator in 
a thrust neutral condition when gases exit the 
inflator and specifically when the inflator is not 
part of an air bag module. By thrust neutral it is 
meant that when gas exits the exit ports the resultant 
of the reaction forces is essentially zero. As can be 
appreciated, if the hybrid inflator were not thrust 
neutral and is accidentally energized or gas is 
discharged, such as from an over pressurization due to 
fire, etc., the inflator could be propelled about due 
to the non-zero resultant forces generated by the 
exiting gas flow. As such, the above thrust neutral requirement is 
beneficial when the hybrid inflator is being carried, 
shipped, etc. However, the above requirement, as will  
 
be seen below, reduces the efficiency of the air bag 
inflation process. According to the present invention there is provided a 
hybrid inflator (40) for inflating an air bag, the inflator 
comprising a pressure vessel (42) and a plurality of exit 
ports (16) arranged on the inflator such that inflation gas 
may exit all such exit ports rendering the inflator thrust 
neutral in an unmounted condition and closure means for 
closing a designated set of exit ports thereby rendering the 
inflator in a non-thrust neutral condition when the inflator 
is mounted proximate the air bag and in a support structure. US-A-3 880 447 is exemplary of the prior art showing a 
solid propellant inflator having a plurality of exits ports 
about its body and thus achieving a thrust neutral 
condition of the exiting inflation gas in an unmounted condition. According to a preferred embodiment there is provided 
an air bag module comprising an hybrid inflator, an air bag 
cooperatively disposed about the inflator to receive 
inflation gas exiting the inflator and a structure

<CLAIMS>
A hybrid inflator (40) for inflating an air bag, 
the inflator comprising a pressure vessel (42) and a 

plurality of exit ports (16) arranged on the inflator such 
that inflation gas may exit all such exit ports rendering 

the inflator thrust neutral in an unmounted condition and 
closure means (60) for closing a designated set of exit ports (16) 

thereby rendering the inflator in a non-thrust neutral 
condition when the inflator is mounted proximate the air bag (12) 

and in a support structure (52). 
The hybrid inflator (40) as defined in claim 1, wherein 
the closure of the certain exit ports (16) is achieved by 

inserting a plug (60) therein during assembly of the inflator to 
the support structure (52). 
The hybrid inflator (40), as defined in claim 2, wherein when 
it is desired to separate the inflator from the cooperating 

support structure (52) the plug (60) must first be removed to permit 
removal of the inflator thereby rendering the inflator 

thrust neutral once again. 
An air bag module (50) comprising: 

an hybrid inflator (40) according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
an air bag (12) cooperatively disposed about the 
inflator (40) to receive inflation gas exiting the inflator; and 
a structure (52) for supporting at least the inflator; 
 
   wherein the closure means (60) comprises means for closing 

a designated set of exit ports (16) to render the inflator in a 
non-thrust neutral condition when supported by the  

 
structure (52). 
The air bag module (50) as defined in claim 4, wherein the 
exit ports (16) are arranged about a portion of the inflator (40) such 

that some of the inflation gas would in the unmounted condition 
exit the designated set of exit ports (16) in a first direction 

generally opposite the direction of inflation of the air 
bag (12), and wherein the closure means (60) comprises means to 

prevent the inflation gas from flowing in such first 
direction. 
The air bag module (50) as defined in claim 4 or 5, wherein 
the closure means (60) comprises means to close all of the designated 

exit ports (16), including those exit ports which permit 
inflation gas to exit the inflator in the first direction. 
The air bag module (50) as defined in claim 6, wherein the 
closure means includes a plug (60) received in each of the 

designated exit ports (16). 
The air bag module (50) as defined in claim 7, wherein each 
plug (60) is received through a portion of the structure (52) 

such that if the inflator (40) is removed from the structure each 
plug (60) must also be removed, thereby opening all of previously 

closed exit ports (16) and rendering the inflator in its thrust 
neutral condition once again. 
The air bag module (50) as defined in claim 7 or 8, wherein 
the inflator (40) includes a walled member (52) opposite the 

exit ports (16) and wherein an end of the plug (60) engages 
the walled member (52).
