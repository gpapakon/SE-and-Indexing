<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to conductor coverings such 
as electrical insulation and cable jacketing made from 
thermoplastic compounded polyvinyl chloride. There is increasing demand for eliminating heavy 
metals, especially lead which is considered toxic as 
disposed waste. Removal of lead in thermoplastics 
adapted for wire and cable coverings is an increasing 
concern for post-industrial disposal. Recent patent 
literature has provided some approaches for the 
substitution of lead-based components. For example, 
various β-diketone compounds including salts thereof are 
suggested in synergistic combination with hydrotalcite. 
See U.S. Patent No. 4,427,816. A combination of 
hydrotalcite and molecular sieve zeolite is suggested in 
U.S. Patent No. 5,216,058. A combination of 
hydrotalcite, zinc zeolite and zinc carboxylate is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,141,880. Electrical wire insulation and cable jacketing, 
hereinafter referred to as conductor covering, must have 
a combination of properties characterized typically by 
the tensile strength, elongation and elongation  
 
retention after elevated temperature aging, brittleness 
temperature, volume resistivity, dielectric constant, 
and Shore Hardness. Specific performance ratings exist 
for commercially designated conductor coverings, for 
example electronic wires, CL2/CL2X and CL3/CL3X 
insulation and jacketing, apparatus wires, 75°C rated 
jacketing, 105°C rated jacketing, telecommunicationS 
wire and THHN/THWN (Thermoplastic High Heat Nylon 
coated/Thermoplastic Heat Wet location Nylon coated) 
building wire, and the like, hereinafter collectively 
referred to as conductor covering. Typical nominal 
physical properties desired of conductor coverings are: 
Shore A Hardness>65 Tensile Strength (psi)>1500 Elongation (%)>150 Aged retention (%)>70+ Brittleness Temp (°C)< -30 Volume Resistivity (x10¹² ohm-cm)> 2 Tensile retention in ASTM #2 oil (4 hrs at 70°C) (%)>70 U.S. Patent No. 5,216,058 ('058) teaches that a 
synergism occurs in the use of hydrotalcite and zeolite 
for achieving improved volume resistivity of electrical 
conductor covering. Formulas containing hydrotalcite 
alone, hydrotalcite and diketone, and zeolite alone were 
shown to be inferior in insulating properties compared 
with the inventive combination of hydrotalcite and 
zeolite.  Since lead-based stabilizers are relatively 
inexpensive and highly effective, it is a technical 
challenge to devise adequate substitutes. Commercial 
benefits would accrue from avoiding increased costs
