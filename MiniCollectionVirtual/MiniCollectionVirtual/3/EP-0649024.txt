<ABSTRACT>
The meter is built into a housing which has a housing cover (3) secured by a lead seal and a likewise lead-sealed terminal cover. The housing cover (3) contains a slit for receiving a slide (12, 14, 15) having an inscription field (8) on which the meter settings are specified. The slide projects via one end (15) out of the slit. This end is covered by the terminal cover, so that the slide (12, 14, 15) is secured against unauthorised access.
