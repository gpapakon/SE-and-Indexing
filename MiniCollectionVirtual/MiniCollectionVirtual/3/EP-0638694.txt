<ABSTRACT>
Anchor hooks (10) fit around opposite free edges of the horizontal girder flange (4), the anchor halves (6) being of sheet-metal and each with a horizontal edge (11) at right angles to the girder axis and bearing against the flange underside. The vertical edge is bent at right angles to form a rib (9), by which it is secured to that of the other half. In plan view, each half is U-shaped, having a second plate (8) parallel to the first (7) and also with a hook fitting around the girder flange. Each half can be in one piece and of sheet-metal bent into shape. The ribs of the halves can be drilled for fixing devices, and a locking lug can be bent outwards from each, engaging in a mating recess in the other rib. The lug can be of hammerhead shape, inserted in a slot in the recess from which portions are bent outwards at the sides, the hammerhead edges engaging behind them.

Suspension anchor for I-beams which uses anchor hooks (10) to grip
round the directionally opposed free edges of the horizontal profile flange

(4) of the I-beam, where the suspension anchor comprises two joined
halves (6) made of metal plate, each half being connected to the anchor

hooks (10), where each anchor half (6) comprises two anchor plates (7,8)
which run parallel to each other and are at a distance apart and which run

across the longitudinal axis of the beam in the fitted state, said anchor
plates resting against a horizontal plate edge (11) on the underside of the

profile flange (4), where an anchor web (9) is set at a perpendicular angle
from a vertical plate edge of each anchor plate (7, 8), thereby rendering

each anchor half (7, 8) U-shaped in a state of use, given a horizontal
cross-section, with a force inducing element (12) to induce a suspension

force, characterised in that the anchor webs (9) of the two anchor halves
(6) lie alongside and are connected to each other.
Suspension anchor according to claim 1, characterised in that the two
anchor plates (7, 8), the anchor web (9) connecting them and the two

anchor hooks (10) comprise a one-piece, edged plate metal blank.
Suspension anchor according to claim 1, characterised in that the anchor
webs (9) of the two anchor halves (6) each have flush attachment bores

(12) at their end facing away from the I-beam (1).
Suspension anchor according to claim 1, characterised in that a locking
plate (14) is bent out from each anchor web, said locking plate engaging

positively in a locking recess (15) in the other anchor web (9).
