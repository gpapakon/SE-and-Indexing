<ABSTRACT>
The use, according to the invention, of water-soluble dyes for colouring recording liquids, in particular for the inkjet method, is characterised in that the dyes in the form of the free acid are of the general formula A-(SO2-X)p, in which A represents a customary colour- imparting radical carrying at least one sulpho group and from the class consisting of the mono- or disazo dyes or complexes thereof with chromium, iron, cobalt or copper, the copper or nickel phthalocyanines, anthraquinones, dioxazines or copper formazan complexes, p is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and X represents a vinyl group or a radical of the formulae -CH2CH2OR

 or that X represents a radical of the formula

The dyes used according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se, analogously to vinylsulphonyl or ss-sulphatoethylsulphonyl dyes, the reactive groups being reacted with nucleophiles, such as R
