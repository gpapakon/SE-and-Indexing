<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an admixture for hydraulic 
cement containing, as an effective component, an 
acrylamide amphoteric polymer produced as a result of 
Hofmann degradation reaction. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a sophisticated admixture 
for hydraulic cement that prevents deterioration in 
workability of concrete or mortar with passage of time 
and permits improvement of constructability and 
application properties thereof. Hydraulic cement composition containing cement, 
water, aggregate and admixtures loses fluidity with the 
passage of time because cement coheres both chemically 
and physically when mixed with water. This means that 
the hydraulic cement composition is deteriorated with 
passage of time in constructability and application 
properties. Such deterioration may sometimes cause 
troubles in, for example, pumping cement composition. If  
 
pumping may be suspended for some reason and restarted 
later, the fluidity of the hydraulic cement composition 
in a pipe is reduced to cause a rapid increase of the 
pumping pressure or even clogging of the pipe. The 
fluidity may be improved with an increased amount of 
water mixed, which, however, significantly reduces 
strength of the resultant concrete. To overcome the above mentioned problems, various 
water reducing agents for hydraulic cement have been 
proposed such as lignin sulfonic acid salt, hydroxy 
carboxylic acid salt, β-naphthalenesulfonic acid salt-formalin 
condensation products, sulfon group-containing 
melamine-formaldehyde resins, and polycarboxylic acid 
salt. More recently, it has been proposed to use water 
reducing agents such as a partial-hydrolysis product of 
polyacrylamide or a copolymer of an anionic monomer and 
acrylamide to reduce slump loss (Japanese Patent 
Publication No. HEI 1-55210/1989). These water reducing 
agents, however, have unsatisfactory physical properties 
such as dispersion fluidity, slump holding properties, 
and storage stability and are thus somewhat unsuitable for 
recent development of architecture and civil engineering 
technologies. With this respect, there have been strong 
demands for more sophisticated water reducing agents.  According to the present invention, it is provided 
with an admixture for hydraulic cement comprising as an 
effective component an amphoteric polymer obtained by 
reacting an α,β-unsaturated carbonamide polymer having a 
weight average molecular weight of 1,000 - 1,000,000 with 
10-100 mole% of hypohalogenous acid or salt thereof 
relative
