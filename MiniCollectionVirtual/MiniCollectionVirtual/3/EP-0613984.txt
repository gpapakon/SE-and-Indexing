<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a twin washbasin. 
More particularly, a washbasin separated by an integrally 
partition-into two basins which are designed for mouth and 
face washes, respectively. The prior art of a washbasin is generally made for 
mouth and face washes in one lavatory which is not easy to 
keep it clean, especially after mouth wash. Some people, 
when they wash their face, will keep water flush and use 
their hands to hold water to wash their face. This may 
avoid any bacteria attached on the basin to them. The inventor has therefore invented the present 
invention which separate the washbasin into two basins for 
mouth and face washes at different basin.  It is the primary object of the present invention to 
provide a twin washbasin which has two basins one for mouth 
wash and the other for face wash. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a twin washbasin which complies with sanitary 
requirement. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a twin washbasin which allows two people to do 
their fresh up at the same time. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a twin basin which is inexpensive to manufacture.  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the present 
invention; FIG. 2 is a top view of the present invention ; and FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the present 
invention. Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings 
are for the purpose of illustrating an embodiment 
of the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting 
the same, FIG. 1 shows the washbasin 1 supported by a 
stand 2, divided by a partition 13 into two basins, a 
mouth wash basin 11 and a face wash basin 12. Each basin 
11, 12 has an individual drainage 111, 121 and are joint 
at the end of the two drainages and connected to vent 21 of 
the stand 2. The drainage 111 of the mouth wash basin 11 is better 
grilled to filter larger objects and allows only water and 
smaller objects passing through. The drainage 121 of the 
face wash basin 12 has a stopper so that user may storage 
water inside. A faucet 14 is rotatable mounted to the twin 
washbasin in such a manner that both basins 11, 12 share 
the faucet 14.
