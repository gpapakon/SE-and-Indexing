<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pyroelectric infrared
radiation detector for detecting an intensity of infrared
radiation with a pyroelectric element and to a method of
producing the same.A variety of pyroelectric infrared radiation detectors
which can detect an object or temperature without direct
contact have been utilized for measuring the temperature of
a cook in an electronic oven, controlling an air conditioner
to the room temperature, activating the opening and closing
of an automatic door, triggering an alarm device, and so
forth. Their range of applications will surely be increased
in the coming future.The pyroelectric infrared radiation detector is a sort
of sensor using the pyroelectric effect of a ferroelectric
substance. The ferroelectric substance has spontaneous
polarization in one direction to generate positive and
negative charges at the surface. In a common state under
the atmospheric pressure, it remains neutral while coupling
with charges of molecules in the atmosphere. It is known
that every object emits an intensity of infrared ray according
to the temperature. An infrared radiation sensor upon
receiving at its probe an intensity of infrared radiation 
from an object causes its ferroelectric substance to produce
an electricity corresponding to the thermal change by the
radiation. For measuring the intensity of infrared radiation
at higher accuracy, it is thus needed to have an infrared
radiation detecting structure of the detector increased
in the thermal response. This is implemented by using a
thin film of a pyroelectric material.One of the conventional pyroelectric infrared radiation
detectors will be explained.Figs. 9(a), 9(b), and 9(c) are a plan view, a cross
sectional view, and a processing flow chart respectively of
the conventional pyroelectric infrared radiation detector.
As shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), there are provided a single
crystal substrate of magnesium oxide 91 (referred to as
(100) MgO single crystal substrate hereinafter) and two electrodes
92a and 92b. The electrode 92b serves as an infrared
radiation absorbing layer. Also, a pyroelectric thin film
93 is disposed between the two electrodes 92a and 92b in
layers thus constituting an infrared radiation detecting
structure. Denoted by 94a and 94b are polyimid resin layers
for protecting and supporting the infrared radiation detecting
structure or more particularly, main parts of the electrodes
92a and 92b. The resin layer 94a acts as an interlayer
insulating layer between the two electrodes 92a and
92b. There
