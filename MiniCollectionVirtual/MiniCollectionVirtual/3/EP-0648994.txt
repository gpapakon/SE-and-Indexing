<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention comprises a male rod (post) (5) fixed to the door (1) and engaging in a female element (6) fixed to the muffle (2) of the oven. The female element (6) comprises locking members (9) which can move radially to engage in an intermediate groove (8) of the male rod (5) when the door is closed. Unlocking takes place by maneouvering a push-button (13) which pushes back an internal bearing annulus (19) which bears against an unlocking ring (10) which itself urges the locking members (9) away from the internal bore (7) of the female element (6) in order to get them out of the groove (8) of the male rod (5).

<CLAIMS>
Device for locking an oven door (1) whose
contact side (3) is pressed against a corresponding

contact side (4) of an oven muffle (2), wherein :

a male rod (5) projects perpendicularly from the
contact side (3, 4) of the first of the two members

comprising said door (1) and said muffle (2),
a female member (6) is fitted to the second of
said two members comprising said door (1) and said

muffle (2),
said male rod (5) and said female member (6) are
shaped and disposed so that said male rod (5) enters

said female member (6) when said door (1) is pressed
against the opening of said muffle (2) to close it,
said male rod (5) includes at least one
intermediate annular groove (8),
said female member (6) includes locking members
(9) movable radially between a locking position in

which they enter said internal bore (7) and into said
groove (8) of said male rod to prevent axial sliding of

said male rod (5) and an unlocking position in which
they are withdrawn from said internal bore (7) and from

said groove (8) to allow axial sliding of said male rod
(5),

characterised in that :

said female member (6) includes an unlocking
ring (10) sliding axially on it and shaped to move said

locking members (9) radially between their locking
position and their unlocking position when it is moved

axially,
spring means (12) urge said unlocking ring (10)
towards its locking position in which said locking

members (9) are in their locking position, and
a push-button (13) is provided on the first of
said two members comprising said door (1) and said

muffle (2) and is shaped to move said unlocking ring 
(10) in translation on said female member (6) to bring

about unlocking.
Device according to claim 1 characterised in
that said male rod (5) is fixed to said oven door (1)

and said push-button (13) is slidably mounted on said
oven door (1) and is adapted to be operated by an oven

door handle.
Device according to claim 2 characterised in
that said female member (6) comprises an electric

switch device (16) in its internal bore (7) adapted to
be operated by said male rod (5) to close an electric

contact controlling units inside said oven when said
male rod (5) is moved to its locking position.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that said male rod (5) and said female

member (6) each have an axial bore through them
connected to respective pipes to allow fluid to flow

between said muffle (2) and said oven door (1).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that said female member (6) comprises

auxiliary locking means (22) adapted to be elastically
engaged in said groove (8) when said male rod (5) is in

an intermediate pre-opening position in which said door
(1) is slightly open and retained by said auxiliary

locking means (22) engaged in said groove (8), said
door (1) being thereafter openable by deliberately

pulling on it to withdraw said auxiliary locking means
(22) from said groove (8).
Device according to claim 5 characterised in
that said auxiliary locking means (22) comprise balls

spring-loaded towards the axis of said female member
(6).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that a spring (23) urges said push-button

(13) away from said unlocking ring (10).
Device according to claim 7 characterised in
that said push-button (13) comprises a head (14) joined 

by a rod (17) to a bearing plate (18) joined to an
internal thrust ring (19) by three columns (20, 21)

slidably mounted in said oven door (1) around said male
rod (5), said internal thrust ring (19) bearing on said

unlocking ring (10).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 8
characterised in that a motor or an actuator (24) is

adapted to pull on whichever of said male rod (5) or
said female (6) member is slidably mounted on said oven

muffle (2), manual clutch means being provided for
decoupling said female member (6) from said motor or

actuator (24).
