A cotyloidal prosthesis, in particular for a coxofemoral joint,
of the kind comprising for co-operation with a spherical head (12) a

ceramic part (18) whose internal surface (19) belongs to a sphere (S),
characterised in that the ceramic part (18) is reduced to a ring and that

the ring forming said ceramic part (18) is hooped by a band (35).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to claim 1 characterised in
that the height (H) of the ring forming the ceramic part (18), as measured

parallel to its axis (A), is at most equal to half the radius (R) of the
sphere (S).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to claim 2 characterised in
that the height (H) of the ring forming the ceramic part (18) is between a

third and half the radius (R) of the sphere (S).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the front and rear faces (20, 21) of the ring

forming the ceramic part (18) extend in two parallel planes.
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the front face (20) of the ring forming the ceramic

part (18) extends in a plane which is slightly set back with respect to an
equatorial plane (P) of the sphere (S).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that the outside surface (25) of the ring forming the

ceramic part (18) is cylindrical.
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the band (35) is metal. 
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that the ring forming the ceramic part (18) is carried by

a cup (11) of synthetic material, being disposed in same in the proximity
of its opening (16).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to claim 8 characterised in
that the cup (11) of synthetic material is internally lined by a metal cup

(37).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to either one of claims 8 and
9 characterised in that starting from the ring forming the ceramic part

(18), the inside surface (28) of the cup (11) extends at a spacing from
the sphere (S) to which the inside surface (19) of same belongs.
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to claim 10 characterised in
that the inside surface (28) of the cup (11) belongs to a sphere (S')

whose radius (R') is greater than that (R) of the sphere (S) to which
belongs the inside surface (19) of the ring forming the ceramic part (18).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 8 to 11
characterised in that a ring portion (36) of elastic material is radially

disposed between the ring forming the ceramic part (18) and the cup (11).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 8 to 12
characterised in that the ring forming the ceramic part (18) is a force

fit in the cup (11).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 8 to 13
characterised in that latching means are provided between the cup (11) and

the ring forming the ceramic part (18).
A cotyloidal prosthesis according to any one of claims 1 to 14
characterised in that a fixing member (15) is externally associated

therewith.
