<ABSTRACT>
The heat exchanger includes a jacket (casing, housing) (1) having a bundle of heat exchange tubes (pipes) (2) and having stubs (sockets, connectors) (10, 11) which serve to guide an intertubular medium in and out and between which a longitudinal partition (9) is located. A receiving chamber (4) connected to one of the end faces of the jacket (1) is provided with stubs (sockets, connecting pieces) (6, 7) for guiding a heat carrier in and out. A means (14) for hermetically tight connection of the longitudinal partition and the jacket (1) is designed in the form of packets (15) of elastic strips (16) which are connected to both sides of the longitudinal partion (9) over their entire length in a symmetric fashion in sections adjoining the inside surface of the jacket (1). A part of each strip (16) projects over the boundaries of the partition (9) and makes contact with the inside surface of the jacket (1).
