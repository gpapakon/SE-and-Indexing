<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of sustained release pellets comprising pelletizing a mixture containing the drug in finely divided form and a binder. The characteristic feature is that: (a) said binder is in particle form consisting of one or more water-insoluble wax-like binder substance(s) with a melting point above 40  DEG C, and (b) said pelletization step is performed by mechanically working said mixture, in a high shear mixer, under the input of a sufficient amount of energy for the binder to melt and pelletization to take place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of 
pellets having defined and sustained release characteristics 
and their multiple unit dose formulations. The term "pellets" will forthcomingly refer to spherical 
or spheroidal particles having diameters ranging from 
0.2-2.5 mm. By "multiple unit dose formulation" is contemplated an 
oral dose formulation that at the appropriate location in the 
gastrointestinal tract, usually the stomach or intestines 
makes available a high number of similar units (e.g. pellets 
or granules). In the field of pharmaceutical development, it is 
generally agreed that the oral administration of a multiple 
unit dose formulation possessing a sustained release of the 
drug substance is beneficial compared to conventional tablet 
formulations having similar release properties. The benefits 
of multiple unit dose formulations are primarily that the 
transport and distribution of the free units in the various 
segments of the gastrointestinal tract are more uniform and 
reproducible than single unit dosage forms. With respect to tablets one has successfully obtained the 
desired release properties by coating the tablets with wax-like 
substances or mixes thereof, or by embedding the drug 
substance in a matrix of binder of different degree of 
hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, if necessary together with 
auxiliary substances like fillers, buffering substances etc. With respect to granulation/pelletization of powdery drugs 
the more common techniques are:  
 
(i) Coating inert particles ("non-pareilles" = placebo 
pellets) with a solution or suspension that contains an 
active substance, binder and water. The amount of 
active substance in the pellets/granules will 
normally be </= 30% (w/w). The product will have a 
spherical/spheroidal form when the starting material 
has such a form. (ii) Extrusion of a moistened mass that contains active 
substance and an appropriate plastifying binder (e.g. 
10-50% microcrystalline cellulose or methyl cellulose), 
followed by rounding the extrudate on a rotating disc. (iii) Coating of crystals of active substance with 
auxiliary substances like suitable polymers. The 
geometric shape of the ultimate pellets/granules is 
determined by the geometric shape of the crystals. (iv) Atomization and subsequent cooling of a melt containing 
the drug substance. In order to optimize and control the sustained release 
properties, the granules should preferably be spherical 
(pellets) and have a uniform size. Niro Atomizer has introduced a novel method

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of sustained release 
pellets comprising pelletizing a mixture containing the 

drug in finely divided form and a binder, 
characterized
 
in that 


(a) said binder is particulate and consists of one or 
more water-insoluble wax-like binder substances with a 

melting point above 40Â°C, and 
(b) said pelletization step is performed by 
mechanically working said mixture, in a high shear 

mixer, under the input of a sufficient amount of energy 
for the binder to melt and pelletization to take place; 

provided that drugs in cohesive form in combination with binder in 
excess to give overmoist pellets that are subsequently mechanically 

worked together with an additional portion of the drug are excluded. 
A process for the manufacture of sustained release 
pellets according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
said pellets after being formed 


(i) are sieved thereby removing pellets of sizes above 
and below predetermined limits, whereafter 
(iii) the remaining pellets are portioned into dose 
units. 
A process for the manufacture of sustained release 
pellets according to any of claims 1-2, 
characterized
 
in that a further portion of a wax-like binder 

substance is added to the mixture after the pellets 
have been formed whereupon the working of the mixture 

is continued so that the wax-like substance of the 
further portion melts and coats the pellets. 
A process for the manufacture of sustained release 
pellets according to anyone of claims 1-3, 


characterized
 in that the drug is intended for the 
treatment of a disease within the field of urology, 

gynecology, autoimunity or gastroenterology.
