<ABSTRACT>
An orthodontic bracket (20) having mesial and distal 
sections (22, 24) is debonded from a tooth (40) by pivoting the 

sections toward each other in respective arcs about a 
central reference axis extending in an occlusal-gingival 

direction. The mesial and distal sections 
are discrete and spaced apart from each other, or 

alternatively integrally joined by a relatively thin 
web that bends and optionally fractures upon 

debonding. A metallic archwire slot liner 
interconnects the mesial and distal sections and 

enhances sliding mechanics of the bracket. A pliers-like 
debonding tool includes jaws with stops for 

limiting the lingual depth of engagement of the jaws 
with the mesial and distal sides of the bracket, to 

facilitate pivoting of the mesial and distal sections 
during debonding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ceramic orthodontic
bracket having a channel for facilitating removal of
the bracket from a tooth.Orthodontic treatment involves movement of the
teeth toward positions for correct occlusion. During
treatment, tiny orthodontic appliances known as
brackets are connected to the teeth, and an archwire
is placed in a slot of each bracket. The archwire
forms a track to guide movement of the teeth to
orthodontically correct positions.Orthodontic brackets are typically made of metal,
ceramic or plastic. Metal brackets are widely used
and are considered by many orthodontists to have
mechanical properties that are satisfactory for moving
the teeth to desired positions. Unfortunately, metal
brackets are not aesthetic in the mouth and often lead
to comments of a "metallic mouth appearance" that can
be an embarrassment to the patient.Orthodontic brackets that are made of a plastic
material are generally considered more aesthetic than
metal brackets. However, some plastic brackets are
stained by certain food and beverages and turn an
unsightly color after a period of time. Moreover, the
plastic material may slowly creep in use such that the
archwire slot widens and precise control of tooth
movement is hindered. Orthodontic brackets that are made of transparent
or translucent ceramic materials overcome many of the
problems associated with plastic brackets, since
ceramic material is resistant to staining and does not
deform by creep as in the case with plastic brackets.
U.S. Patent No. 4,954,080, assigned to the assignee of
the present invention, describes a color-free ceramic
bracket made of polycrystalline material with a
translucency that permits the natural color of the
tooth to diffusely show through the bracket. An
improved translucent polycrystalline ceramic bracket
having a metallic archwire slot liner to enhance
sliding movement of the bracket on the archwire is
described in pending U.S. applications Serial Nos.
08/061,215 and 08/061,164, both of which were filed on
May 13, 1993.In the past, orthodontic brackets were commonly
secured to bands that were placed around the teeth.
Today, orthodontic brackets are often bonded directly
to the surface of the teeth. Once treatment has been
completed, the archwire is removed from the slot of
the brackets and each bracket is then removed from the
associated tooth.Metal brackets are typically debonded by using a
peeling or prying motion. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,986,265
and 4,248,587 describe plier-type hand instruments
that are used with a prying

A ceramic orthodontic bracket (20) comprising a
mesial section (22), a distal section (24) and an archwire slot (30)

extending in a generally mesial-distal direction in
said mesial section (22) and said distal section (24), said

bracket (20) including an elongated channel (32) extending in a
generally occlusal-gingival direction between said

mesial section (22) and said distal section (24), said channel (32)
having a depth in a lingual direction that is greater

than the lingual depth of said archwire slot (30), said
bracket (20) including a frangible web (38) interconnecting said

mesial section (22) and said distal section (24) lingually of
said channel (32) and extending along the length of said

channel (32), said web (38) having thickness in a labial-lingual
direction sufficiently small

to flex on fracture
to enable said

bracket (20) to be debonded from a tooth (40) by rocking said
mesial section (22) and said distal section (24) about a

reference axis extending generally parallel to the
longitudinal axis of said channel (32).
The bracket (20) of claim 1, wherein said web (38)
integrally interconnects said mesial section (22) and said

distal section (24).
The bracket (20) of claim 1, wherein said web (38)
includes two parts (52d,54d) connected by an adhesive that

fractures when said bracket (20) is debonded from a tooth (40).
The bracket (20) of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said mesial
section (22) and said distal section (24) each include an

external surface (34,36) for bonding said bracket (20) to a tooth (40),
and wherein said bracket (20) includes a recess (39b) extending

between said external surface (34) of said mesial section (22)
and said external surface (36) of said distal section (24) in a

generally occlusal-gingival direction and generally
parallel to said channel (32), said recess (39b) having a bottom 

surface that is spaced buccolabially from adjacent
regions of said external surface (34,36) of said mesial

section (22) and said distal section (24).
The bracket (20) of any of claims 1 to 4 and including a metal
liner (48) interconnecting said mesial section (22) and said

distal section (24).
The bracket (20) of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein said mesial
section (22) and said distal section (24) are substantially

identical.
The bracket (20) of any of claims 1 to 6, including at least
one bridge (29) extending between said mesial section (22) and

said distal section (24), said bridge (29) being spaced
buccolabially from said web (38).
