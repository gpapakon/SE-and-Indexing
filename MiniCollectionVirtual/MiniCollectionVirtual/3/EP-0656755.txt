<ABSTRACT>
A rich and creamy sauce or soup is provided with a reduced fat content by incorporating the fat droplets in two populations, ie droplets above 10 microns and droplets below 5 microns, with the emulsion being substantially free of fat droplets between 5 and 10 microns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sauces for intended addition in 
a heated state to prepared food or for addition to food for 
preparation together; and to soups. There is generally a desire to reduce the concentration of 
fats and oils in food intake. However, in spite of this 
"healthy-eating" drive, there is also the requirement for 
food products to have the desired rich and creamy taste and 
appearance. This conflict of requirements is particularly 
noticeable in the sauce and soup market. Both fats and oils are based on triglycerides and each may 
be used as a sauce or soup component, in order to achieve 
the necessary textural characteristics, in particular 
creaminess and smoothness, in association with a desirable 
flavour. For convenience the term "fat" will be used to 
identify the liquid triglyceride component in the sauces or 
soups. The applicants have now discovered that the desirable 
characteristics of low fat, creaminess, smoothness and 
richness can all be achieved in a sauce or soup, provided 
that the particle size distribution of the fat droplets 
dispersed in the aqueous medium is controlled. Accordingly the present invention relates to a sauce or 
soup comprising from 2% to 10% by weight of fat droplets as 
an emulsion in an aqueous base wherein the droplets exist 
in two populations:  
 
(a) large droplets of at least 10 µm in size; and (b) small droplets of less than 5 µm in size;  
such that the emulsion is substantially free of fat 
droplets between 5 and 10 µm; 
providing that the sauce or soup comprises at least 1% 
large droplets. A two population, ie bimodal, emulsion is described in EP 
0076548 (Unilever) in a spread composition. However this 
is used in the preparation of a duplex O/W/O emulsion. A sauce as prepared by a chef will usually have a small 
amount of butter stirred in as a last step in the 
preparation. It is expected this will form coarse droplets 
above 10 micron. The fat content of the base sauce before 
final butter addition would have a droplet size extending 
over a range and not limited to below 5 µm (micron). The invention relates to the provision of a rich and creamy 
sauce or soup having a bimodal fat droplet distribution, 
the sauce or soup being substantially free of fat droplets 
in the 5 to 10 µm size range because in this range there 
are only the tails of droplet distribution. The bimodal fat droplet distribution provides the sauce or 
soup with both a "rich" gloss and with a creamy smoothness 
which consumers desire and in the case of sauces
