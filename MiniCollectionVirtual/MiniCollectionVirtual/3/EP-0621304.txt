<ABSTRACT>
Flameproofed thermoplastic moulding compositions obtainable by mixing       A) from 20 to 70% by weight of a magnesium hydroxide and B) from 0 to 70% by weight of conventional additives and processing auxiliaries into a melt of C) from 10 to 80% by weight of a polyamide (nylon) prepolymer having a viscosity number of from 40 to 100 ml/g, and subsequently post-condensing the mixture in the solid phase.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a flameproofed thermoplastic 
molding material obtainable by mixing 


A) from 20 to 70% by weight of a magnesium hydroxide and 
B) from 0 to 70% by weight of further additives and processing 
assistants
 
into a melt of 
C) from 10 to 80% by weight of a polyamide prepolymer having 
a viscosity number of from 40 to 100 ml/g (measured in a 

0.5% strength by weight solution in concentrated sulfuric 
acid at 23Â°C) 
 
and then carrying out solid-phase postcondensation. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, after the solid-phase 
postcondensation, the polyamide has a viscosity number 

of at least 130 ml/g. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein component A is 
a magnesium hydroxide pretreated with a silane compound.
