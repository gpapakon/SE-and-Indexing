<ABSTRACT>
A snowboard shoe for freestyle boarding consists as usual of a soft boot-shaped inner part and a boot-shaped outer part which is provided with a soft shaft. In order to transmit the force for backside turns even with laterally bent legs, a rigid insert is provided between the inner part and the outer part, which extends around the heel region. At the level of the joint between foot and lower leg, a rigid back part, which surrounds the calf, is articulated on the insert pivotably about an axis running in the longitudinal direction of the shoe.
