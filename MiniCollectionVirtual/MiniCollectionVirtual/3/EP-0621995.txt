<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionA 0-100% Duty Cycle, Transformer Isolated FET DriverTechnical FieldThis invention relates to transistor drive circuits, and more particularly to driving a transistor with a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal having a duty cycle of from 0 to 100%.Background ArtPower Field Effect Transistor (FET) devices (e.g.. Metal Oxide Semiconductor FETsâ€” MOSFETs) are used to control the power delivered to loads such as, e.g., motors and transformers. The control method is usually PWM or some form of pulse modulation. This requires that the power device be switched ON and OFF quickly to minimize power loss in the linear conduction region. Power MOSFETs are ideal in this application due to their high switching speeds, low conduction losses, low drive power requirements, and high power handling capability.To provide the full range of power control (0 to 100%) , it is necessary for the power device to be driven at any duty cycle (the ratio of ON time to ON + OFF time) from 0 to 100%. Since the power FET may be located in a high voltage circuit or in series with the high voltage side of a power line, a drive circuit for the FET is often required to provide electrical isolation between the FET and the controlling circuit, such as a microprocessor or discrete digital logic. TwoH2146EDpctSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 common electrical isolation drive techniques are optocoupler and transformer. Optocoupler drivers use an optocoupler to provide electrical isolation between the control circuit and the power device. The control circuit drives a light emitting diode (LED) within the optocoupler, the photons emitted create a current in an isolated output transistor which is amplified and used to drive the FET.A major drawback to the optocoupler is that the output transistor requires a power source. Thus, an isolated voltage must be provided which is referenced to the FET circuit, creating another isolation problem. Further, multiple drivers in different circuits require multiple isolated sources. In addition, optocouplers experience an aging effect wherein the input to output current gain degrades over time, requiring excessive drive current to guarantee performance over the long term. On the other hand, transformer coupled drivers typically use a small pulse transformer to provide electrical isolation. The control circuit drives the transformer primary and the secondary is connected to the power FET. This method can produce fast switching times, but also has a major drawback. As the duty cycle of the control input is varied, the
