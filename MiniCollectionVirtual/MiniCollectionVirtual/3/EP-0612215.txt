<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to agents for
controlling plant growth and methods for their use and
preparation. The invention particularly relates to a
combination of an abscission agent and monocarbamide dihydrogen
sulfate, which combination is characterized by synergistic
defoliation activity.Special tissue regions at the base of a leaf, flower
or fruit stalk are responsible for the separation of plant
organs such as leaves, flowers, and fruit from the plant body.
When the separation process begins, the cell walls in the
separation zone become soft so that the separation of the
organ (abscission) becomes possible through mechanical forces,
for example, by wind, or by weight of the organ itself. This,
however, often does not take place at the desired time or to
a desired extent. Frequently, it is advantageous to achieve
this process in a controlled manner at a certain time or stage
in the development of a plant.Controlled defoliation is of special economic
importance because of the easier harvesting and accelerated
ripening obtainable thereby in agricultural and horticultural
crops. Abscission agents for inducing such defoliation, via
hormonal regulation, are known. For example, thidiazuron,
the common name for n-phenyl-n'-1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl urea,
is a known cotton defoliant and has been registered for such
purpose with the Environmental Protection Agency.Defoliation also may be accomplished by leaf injury
with certain herbicides. The herbicide may be of either the
contact or systemic variety. A contact herbicide requires
that a substantial portion of the plant be contacted with the
active ingredient of the herbicide being applied. A systemic 
herbicide translocates through the plant and substantial
surface contact is not required.Many chemical agents have been found which are
useful for the defoliation of plants, either through hormonal
regulation or herbicidal injury, and have been registered with
the Environmental Protection Agency for certain selected uses.
Their effectiveness frequently varies greatly depending upon
the climatic conditions, application rates, and the plant to
which they are being applied. Thus, there still is a need for
an improved agent for effectively defoliating plants to
facilitate harvest, for the destruction of plants for weed
control, and the like.According to one aspect of the invention, there is
provided a composition for controlling vegetation comprising
(I) a thiazol-urea abscission agent having the formula

wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the
