<CLAIMS>
An electronic device including at least two voltage
amplifying stages (1, 1'), each having signal input

terminals (5, 7) and signal output terminals (6, 8) and
voltage supply terminals (11, 12; 9, 10), the supply

terminals of the stages (1, 1') being connected in
series between two power supply terminals (13, 14) of

the device, the signal input and output terminals (5,
6, 7, 8) of the stages (1, 1') being connected in

cascade, and further including an automatic gain
correction circuit, characterised in that the said

circuit comprises a means (40) for detecting the level
of the output signal (B) of a given stage (1') of the

device other than the input stage, and having its
output connected to the control electrode (42) of a

controllable current source (41), the output of which
is connected to the input (-) of an adder (34) disposed

at the input of a preceding stage (1) on which the
automatic gain correction is applied.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the controllable current source (41) comprises a

transistor.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the correction is of negative type.
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the stages further include

filters. 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that each stage receives a

polarisation voltage at least equal to its minimum
polarisation voltage.
