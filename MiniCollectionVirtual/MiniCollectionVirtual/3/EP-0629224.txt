<ABSTRACT>
The use of chelating type cation exchange resins, particularly those with iminodiacetic acid functionality, to remove dissolved multivalent cations such as iron, zinc, and chromium from used autodeposition compositions permits reuse of the autodeposition compositions without the need for added surfactant and without developing any undesirable graininess or other texture in the coatings formed. The cation exchange resins can be efficiently regenerated with 0.5 to 4 % by weight aqueous hydrofluoric acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionREGENERATING CHELATING TYPE ION EXCHANGE RESINSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to processes for separating from autodeposition compositions dissolved and/or dispersed metal ions having a valence of two or higher (this type of metal ions being briefly denoted hereinafter as "multival¬ ent") , particularly iron, chromium, and/or zinc cations. The invention also relates to regenerating to their acid form chelating type cation exchange resins, particularly those containing iminodiacetic acid functional groups, after the cation exchange resins have been at least par¬ tially loaded with multivalent metal cations, particularly with iron, chromium, and/or zinc cations. In one embod¬ iment of particular interest, the invention relates to re- generating such ion exchange resins that have been used to remove iron, chromium, and/or zinc cations from autodeposi¬ tion baths. 

 Statement of Related ArtAutodeposition involves the use of an aqueous resinous coating composition of relatively low solids concentration (usually less than about 10 %) to form a coating of rela- tively high solids concentration (usually greater than about 10 %) on a metallic surface immersed therein, with the coating increasing in thickness and areal density (i.e., mass per unit area of coating) the longer the time the metallic surface is immersed in the composition. Auto- deposition is somewhat similar to electrodeposition but does not require the aid of external electrical current to cause the resin particles to deposit on the metal surface.In general, autodepositing compositions are aqueous acid solutions having solid resin particles dispersed therein in very finely divided form. The coating formed while the metal substrate used is immersed in the bath is generally wet and fairly weak, although sufficiently strong to maintain itself against gravity and moderate spraying forces. In this state the coating is described as "un- cured". To make an autodeposition coated object suitable for normal practical use, the uncured coated is dried, usu¬ ally with the aid of heat. The coating is then described as "cured".Basic constituents of an autodepositing composition are water, resin solids dispersed in the aqueous medium of the composition, and activator, that is, an ingredient or ingredients which convert the composition into one which will form on a metallic surface a resinous coating which increases in thickness or areal density as long as the surface is immersed in the composition.
