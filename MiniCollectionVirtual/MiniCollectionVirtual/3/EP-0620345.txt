aa) the pressure (P1) of the end chamber fluid 
applied to a full cross-section (Q1) of the 

separating piston unit (507) exerts a push-out effect on 
the separating piston unit (507), 
ab) as a result of this push-out effect in the rod 
chamber (505), a pressure of the rod chamber 

fluid is generated which exerts on a differential 
cross-section (Q2) between the full cross-section (Q1) 

of the separating piston unit (507) and a rod cross-section 
(Q3) of the piston rod (504) a 

push-in effect on the separating piston unit (507), 
ac) the push-in effect generated by the rod chamber 
pressure (P2), together with an additional push-in effect 

(FG) emanating from the weight of the movable 
structural element (581) maintains equilibrium with the  

 
push-out effect (FG), the pressure (P2) in the rod 

chamber (505) being greater than the pressure (P1) in 
the end chamber (506), 
ad) a lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 
514) opening from the rod chamber (505) to the end 

chamber (506) is exposed to the pressure in 
the rod chamber (505) with a smaller cross-section 

exposed to fluid (522), and is adjusted so that in the 
state of equilibrium it cannot be 

opened by the pressure in the rod chamber (505), 
ae) a lowering non-return valve system (574) opening 
from the end chamber to the rod chamber 

is exposed to the pressure in the end chamber 
(506) and is adjusted so that in the state of 

equilibrium it cannot be opened by the pressure in the 
end chamber (506); 
b) a low, momentary application of external lifting force 
(FH) on the movable structural element (581) results in an 

increase in the pressure in the rod chamber (505) acting on the 
smaller cross-section exposed to fluid (522) of the lifting 

non-return valve system (532, 512, 514), which causes the 
lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 514) to be opened; 


ba) once the lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 

514) has been opened, there is a flow 
of fluid from the rod chamber (505) to the end 

chamber (506); 
bb) the flow from the rod chamber (505) to the end 
chamber (506) suffers a drop in pressure in a 

pressure drop path (510) situated between the lifting 
non-return valve system (532, 512, 514) and the end 

chamber (506);  
 
bc) as a result of this pressure drop, an 
intermediate pressure (PZ) is established within 

the lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 514) 
which is greater than the pressure in the 

end chamber (506); this intermediate pressure (PZ) acts 
on a larger cross-section exposed to fluid (535) of the 

lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 514) in the 
sense of opening the lifting non-return valve system 

(532, 512, 514); as a result of the fluid flow from the 
rod 

chamber (505) through the lifting non-return valve system 
(532, 512, 514) to the end chamber 

(506), the pressure in the rod chamber (505) drops; the 
balance is disturbed and the piston rod (504) is pushed 

out of the cylindrical tube 
(503); 
bd) the pushing of the piston rod (504) out of 
the cylindrical tube (503) causes continued flow 

from the rod chamber (505) to the end chamber (506); this 
continued flow continues to ensure 

maintenance of an intermediate pressure (PZ) in 
the lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 514); this 

intermediate pressure (PZ) furthermore 
acts on the larger cross-section exposed to fluid 

(535) of the lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 
514) and holds it open, even when the 

exertion of external lifting force (FH) ceases; 
the pushing-out movement of the piston rod (504) 

and therefore the lifting of the movable structural 
element (581) are therefore continued 

by the action of the cylinder-piston unit (503, 504), 
without the need for the continued application of an 

external lifting force (FH);  
 
be) if during the continued pushing-out movement 
of the piston rod (504) a depressing force (FN) 

is applied momentarily to the movable structural 
element (581), then the flow rate through the 

lifting non-return valve system (532, 512, 514) 
drops; the intermediate pressure (PZ) acting on 

the larger cross-section exposed to fluid (535)of the 
lifting non-return valve system (532,512,514) drops; the 

lifting non-return valve system 
(532, 512, 514) is closed again; the movable 

structural element (581) comes to a standstill 
and remains stationary, even if the depressing 

force (FN) ceases again; 
c) when the movable structural element (581) is located in 
an intermediate position at rest, it can be moved by a minor 

lowering force (FS) in the direction of the lower end position, 
in that 


ca) firstly there is an increase in the pressure (P1) in 
the end chamber (506), a slight increase in pressure (P1) 

in the end chamber (506) causing 
the lowering non-return valve system (574) to open, 
cb) consequently, there is an approximation of 
pressures between the end chamber (506) and the 

rod chamber (505), and 
cc) the pressure acting on the piston rod cross-section 
(Q3) and prevailing in the two chambers after 

this approximation of the pressure balance 
is established between the rod chamber (505) and 

the end chamber (506) produces a force to push  
 

the rod out, which only slightly exceeds the 
gravity-induced push-in effect on the piston rod 

of the movable structural element (581) on the piston rod 
(504), so that it can be overcome by 

the lowering force (FS) to be permanently applied 
until a desired lower position of the movable 

structural element (581) has been reached.
