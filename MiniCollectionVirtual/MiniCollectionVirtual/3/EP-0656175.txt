<ABSTRACT>
A device for calibrating sausages is proposed, the sausage meat of which is divided into portions by volume and discharged from a sausage meat delivery and sausage meat rotating pipe (4) in order to fill a skin (48) which is pulled over the sausage meat delivery and sausage meat rotating pipe (4) in order, after delivery of the portion by volume, to execute a peripheral rotation in which the sausage ends are fastened, which is characterised in that when the portion of sausage meat emerges from the moulding and guiding elements (12) which determine the extent of the skin (48), the skin (48) is guided away from the exit opening through a distance which is essentially proportional to the portion by volume and is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area determined by the moulding and guiding elements (12).

Device for calibrating sausages the sausage meat of which is
delivered in volume portions from a sausage meat delivery and

rotary pipe (4) for filling a skin (48) drawn over the sausage meat
delivery and rotary pipe (4) in order to make a revolution in

circumferential direction after the supply of a volume portion

during which the ends of the sausage are determined, comprising a
transportation device for picking up a portion and moving it

forwardly, characterised in that the transportation device comprises
shaping and guiding elements (12) determining the circumference

of the skin (48) which are held and guided in opposite positions by
means of several endless strips (8, 9), and that the transportation

device is constructed in such a manner that it is possible to lead
away the skin during the delivery of the portion of sausage meat

from the outlet opening substantially over a distance which is
proportional to the volume portion and reciprocally proportional to

the cross-sectional area determined by the shaping and guiding
elements (12).
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the endless
strips (8, 9) are toothed belts (14, 15) which on their sides turned

away from the shaping and guiding elements (12) mesh with
toothed wheels (18, 19) driven by a motor.
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that individual frame parts (44, 45) having a

common pivoting centre (46) are provided for the endless strips
(8, 9).
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised by roller members (2) guided on an undercarriage (3)

which forms an extension of the sausage meat delivery and rotary
pipe (4).
Device as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that
the shaping and guiding elements (12) are fastened to the outsides

of the endless strips (8, 9) in each case by means of a
counter-clamping plate (23) provided in a tooth gap on the inside 

of the endless strips (8, 9), and that the teeth (21) of the toothed
wheels (18, 19) are subdivided in groups (20) in such a manner that

between neighbouring groups (20) there is formed a toothless
section for receiving the counter-clamping plate (23).
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised by a
stripping apparatus (31, 32) provided in the region of the outer

strand (24, 25) of the respective endless strip (8, 9).
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the shaping and guiding elements (12) are calibrating moulds

comprising in each case an approximately semicircular recess (7).
Device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that the calibrating
moulds (12) on the upper strand (10) of the lower strip (8) and on

the lower strand (11) of the upper strip (9) are arranged in such a
manner that the in each case semicircular recesses (7) of two rows

of calibrating moulds (12) are guided such that they rest against
each other, so that a pipe-shaped engaging piece (13) is formed in

the region of the upper strand (10) of the lower endless strip (8)
and the lower strand (11) of the upper endless strip (9) with the

calibrating moulds (12) resting against each other.
Device as claimed in any one of claims 7 or 8, characterised in that
the calibrating moulds (12) comprise contact surfaces (29)

surrounding the semicircular recess (7), said contact surfaces being
in effective engagement with the contact surfaces (29) of the

opposed calibrating moulds (12).
Device as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 9, characterised in that
the endless strips (8, 9) are arranged on the toothed wheels (18, 19)

in such a manner that the calibrating moulds (12) are placed in a
staggered position, the groove resulting from two calibrating

moulds (12) arranged besides each other being covered by a
calibrating mould (12) arranged on the opposite side.
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that the delivery end of the sausage meat delivery pipe (4) projects 

into the region of the pipe-shaped engaging piece (13) at the
reversal points (16) of the endless strips.
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in
that the pipe-shaped engaging piece (13) formed by the calibrating

moulds (12) is moving away from the outlet opening of the sausage
meat delivery pipe (4) with a velocity exceeding the velocity of the

delivery of the sausage meat by means of the sausage meat
delivery pipe (4).
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in
that the inner diameter of the pipe-shaped engaging piece (13) is

chosen in such a manner that the filled skin (48) is subject to a
clamping action in the pipe-shaped engaging piece (13) during the

process of filling the skin (48) with the sausage meat.
