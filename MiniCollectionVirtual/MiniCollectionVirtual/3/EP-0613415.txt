<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention comprises preparing a polymerizable reaction mixture containing a blowing agent, applying the reaction mixture onto moving conveyor means (7, 10) and allowing a free rise expansion and polymerization of this reaction mixture within a substantially hermetically closed space (17). The pressure in this space is maintained within a predetermined pressure range by continuously supplying gas into said space, in addition to the blowing gas production, and by simultaneously exhausting gas from said space. In this way, pressure fluctuations may be reduced in said space and further parameters such as the temperature can be controlled so as to enable to produce a foam with constant properties. The invention also relates to a device comprising a substantially hermetically enclosed continuous polyurethane slabstock foam producing machine (1) for performing the method according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
continuous manufacture of slabstock polyurethane foam comprising 
preparing a polymerizable reaction mixture containing a blowing agent, 
applying said reaction mixture substantially continuously onto moving 
conveyor means and allowing a free rise expansion and polymerization of 
this reaction mixture so as to form said foam, which free rise expansion 
and polymerization of the reaction mixture is performed in a 
substantially hermetically closed space wherein the reaction mixture is 
at least partially surrounded by a layer of gas, the pressure of which gas 
is maintained during said free rise expansion and polymerization within a 
predetermined pressure range, at least partially by exhausting gas from 
said space. Such a method is disclosed in EP-A1-0 044 226. In 
this known method, the foam process is performed under controlled 
conditions of pressure. According to this method the foam process can 
be performed for example at a reduced pressure so that a smaller 
amount of physical and chemical blowing agents, especially water, is 
required to obtain a desired low density. Due to the smaller amount of 
water, the produced polyurethane foam will be softer. In contrast, the 
hardness of the polyurethane foam can be increased by performing the 
foam process under a higher pressure while using a higher amount of 
blowing agents such as water. In this way, it is therefore possible to 
use the pressure as an additional formulation parameter. A well known problem in the continuous manufacture 
of slabstock polyurethane foam consists in that the surrounding air 
pressure should be maintained always at a same constant value in order 
to manufacture a foam with constant properties. Indeed, it is well 
known that even relatively small pressure fluctuations have for example  
 
an influence on the density and the hardness of the produced foam. In 
this respect, it has been observed that when use is made of the present 
continuously operating polyurethane slabstock foam producing machines, 
which are all of the open type, i.e. wherein the foam process is 
performed under ambient conditions of pressure, day to day changes in 
surrounding atmospheric pressure cause variations of density and of 
other properties such as the hardness of the slabstock foam. Moreover, 
it will be clear that when using a hermetically enclosed continuous foam 
producing machine without appropriate controls, the pressure variations 
within said enclosure may even be much larger and
