<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a novel book scanner (10) that employs 2-dimensional array 
detectors (12a,12b) attached, either rigidly or rotatably, at a common edge (11) and disposed in 

a wedge shaped manner. The opposite edges of the arrays are housed in a base portion (14). 
The base portion (14) additionally supports backlight (24a,24b; Fig.2) to provide the necessary 

illumination of the book pages and the read-out electronics which output the image data 
stored in the detectors to other processing units that may use such data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to scanners that simultaneously scan both
pages of a book of the type as defined in the preamble of claim 1.Before xerography, making copies of documents and books was primarily a manual
process. Typesetting and carbon copies helped to automate this process somewhat for the
creation of documents. However, copying already existing documents was done chiefly by
hand.The advent of xerography created a relatively inexpensive and automated means for
making copies of existing documents. The first copiers were relatively slow (approximately 1
page per minute) and pages were manually fed. Today, a state of the art copier can produce
copies at over 100 pages per minute. Additionally, document feeders, attached to the basic
copier, allow users to copy great stacks of pages at a time automatically.While copier speed has improved over time, current copiers employ fairly much the
same technology used by their predecessors - light/lens copying. Essentially, a light/lens copier
works by moving a scanning bar across the entirety of a page. The bar illuminates a portion of
the page and its image is reflected and focused by an optical system of lens and mirrors to an
image capturing device, such as photoreceptor. The image of the page is scanned line by line
until the scanning bar has moved down the entire length of the page - usually by a system of
wheels and pulleys.While the traditional light/lens copiers work well for the reproduction of loose
document pages, this type of copier does not work so well for the reproductions of bound
pages, such as found in a book. Most conventional copiers still employ a flat plate glass surface
on which the document pages are positioned for image capture. In reproducing book pages,
the book is opened to the pages of interest and held, face down, to allow the copier to capture
the image. On a flat plate, this process stresses the binding of a book over the course of
repeated copying. This stressing is even greater if the user pushes down on the spine of the
book to insure that the image is not distorted by the natural curvature of a book page at the
point where it connects with the spine. US-A-4,486,655, in a first embodiment, describes a plate-shaped book scanner to be
inserted between two adjacent pages of the book for scanning facing sides thereof. The
scanner includes two parallel scanning surfaces facing outwardly and in opposite
direction to each other. The plate, however, has a defined thickness which induces stress
on the binding of the

<CLAIMS>
A scanner for capturing the image of pages in a book (30), said
scanner comprising:


first and second scanning surfaces (12a, 12b) opposing each other
and facing outwardly, said first scanning surface (12a) including a

first 2-dimensional detector (50) located upon said first surface for
collecting image data, and said second scanning surface (12b)

including a second 2-dimensional detector (50) located upon said
second surface for collecting image data;
a light source (24a, 24b) for illuminating the opposing pages
through said detectors (50), and
read-out circuitry (22a, 22b) connected to said detectors (50) for
obtaining image data collected by said detectors,
characterised in that
 said first and second scanning surfaces
(12a, 12b) are arranged to form a substantially wedge shaped

member, said wedge shaped member having an apex formed by a
common edge (11) of said first and second scanning surfaces

(12a, 12b) extending from said apex, said wedge shaped member
further defining a base (14) for supporting said wedge shaped

member with said apex vertically distant from said base, so that a
partially opened book (30) may be supported upon said apex with

its spine adjacent said apex and its opposing pages (32, 34)
adjacent said surfaces (12a, 12b). 
A scanner as recited in claim 1 wherein said first and second
scanning surfaces (12a, 12b) are rigidly coupled at said common

edge (11).
A scanner as recited in claim 1 wherein said first and second
scanning surfaces (12a, 12b) are rotatably coupled at said

common edge (11).
A scanner as recited in any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said first and
second detector (50) are electrically coupled such that there is

one logical scanning surface.
A scanner as recited in claim 4 wherein the first and second
detectors (50), each detector having grid lines (62, 64), are

coupled such that each pair of corresponding grid lines is
connected by a connector (90, 94).
A scanner as recited in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the first
and second detectors (50), each detector having grid lines (62,

64), are coupled such that each grid line from each said detector
is connected to an interconnect circuit (92a, 92b).
