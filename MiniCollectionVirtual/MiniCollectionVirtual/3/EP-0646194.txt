<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to making yarns 
of aramid fibers having particulate material embedded in 
the surface of the individual fibers. United States Patent No. 3,823,035 issued July 
9, 1974 on the application of Sanders, discloses 
suffusing carbon black particles into the surface of 
nylon monofilaments by dissolving nylon at the surface of 
the monofilament and contacting the dissolved nylon with 
the carbon black. United States Patent No. 4,985,046 issued 
January 15, 1991 on the application of Hartzler discloses 
treating the surface of aramid fibers with concentrated 
sulfuric acid to make the fibers more receptive to dyes 
and dye-promoting agents. United States Patent No. 4,525,384 issued 
June 25, 1985 on the application of Aoki et al. discloses 
a process for heat treating yarns of aromatic polyamide 
filaments which avoid interfilament adhesion by sticking 
particulate spacer material to the surface of the fibers 
by a coating process with an aqueous dispersion. European Patent Publication No. 327,736-A, 
published August 16, 1989, discloses the preparation of a 
packing material by feeding continuous filament yarn to a 
blower for entangling the filaments, immersing the 
entangled filaments in an aqueous dispersion of 
fluoropolymer particles, and drying the resulting 
particle-coated filaments.  
 The present invention provides a process for 
manufacturing a yarn of a multitude of individual previously-dried 
filaments of poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) polymeric material having the individual 
filaments separated from each other and having finely-divided 
particulate material partially embedded in the 
surface of the individual filaments comprising the steps 
of: 
a) establishing a liquid system of (i) a first 
liquid of sulfuric acid in a concentration of 70 to 88 
percent capable of swelling but not dissolving said 
polymeric material and (ii) the finely-divided particulate 
material dispersed therein at a concentration of 1 to 10 
grams per 100 grams of dispersion; b) contacting a yarn of a multitude of individual 
filaments of said polymeric material with the liquid system 
for a time adequate to swell the polymeric material at the 
surface of the filaments; c) contacting the swollen polymeric material with 
a second liquid which is a solvent for the first liquid and 
a nonsolvent for said polymeric material. The particulate material is 
preferably graphite, clay or silica. The second liquid 
is preferably water. Fig. 1 is a simplified representation of an 
apparatus useful
