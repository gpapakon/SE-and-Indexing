<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a control
system for controlling a work implement on a work
vehicle, and more particularly to a control system
which provides a coordinated control interface between
the work implement and the vehicle operator.In the field of work vehicles, particularly
those vehicles which perform digging or loading
functions such as excavators, backhoe loaders, and
front shovels, a work implement is generally controlled
by a manual control system having two or more operator
control levers, and additionally, other vehicle control
devices. Typically, the manual control system often
includes foot pedals as well as hand operated levers.
A backhoe manufactured by J. I. Case Manufacturing Co.,
for example, employs three levers and two pedals to
control the work implement. A backhoe manufactured by
Ford Motor Co. utilizes four control levers. There are
drawbacks associated with these implement control
schemes. One is operator stress and fatigue resulting
from having to manipulate so many levers and pedals.
Further, a vehicle operator is required to possess a
relatively high degree of expertise to manipulate and
coordinate the control levers and foot pedals
proficiently. To become productive, an inexperienced
operator also requires a long training period to be
familiar with the controls and their functions.Some manufacturers recognize the
disadvantages of having too many controls, and have
adopted a two-lever control scheme as the norm.
Generally, two vertically mounted two-axis levers share 
the task of controlling the movement of the work
implement's appendages (boom and stick) and the bucket
of the work implement. For example, hydraulic
excavators presently manufactured by Caterpillar Inc.
employ one joystick for stick and swing control, and
another joystick for boom and bucket control.
Similarly, Deere & Co. has a hydraulic excavator with a
joystick for boom and swing control, and another for
stick and bucket control. In each instance, the number
of controls has decreased to two, making machine
operation much more manageable. However, these two-lever
control schemes are still not wholly desirable.
The assignment of implement linkages to the joysticks
is entirely arbitrary, and there exists little
correlation between the direction of movement of the
work implement linkages and those of the control
levers.Further, in a typical leveling operation (or
slope finish) the operator has to manipulate the
control levers about or along at least three axes to
produce a linear movement of the
