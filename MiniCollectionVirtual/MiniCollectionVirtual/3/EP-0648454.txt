<CLAIMS>
A device for displaying packages containing goods, 
comprising 


an anchoring support (2) arranged at a rear end (1) of 
the device for mounting the device at a wall or the like, 

and 
a longitudinal carrier (3) which is manufactured from 
a chemical material for accommodating the packages,
 
characterized in that 
the carrier (3) comrises two legs (4a, 4b) extending 
at a distance from each other, which in the area of a front 

end (5) are connected to each other by an essentially U- or 
V-shaped stirrup (6); and that 
one reinforcement (7) formed by at least one bracing 
(7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e) is provided between the legs (4a, 4b). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the carrier (3) and the anchoring support (2) are integrally 

connected with each other and are preferably manufactured 
from the same chemical material. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the reinforcement is formed by a grid (7) comprising 

several webs (7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the legs (4a, 4b) are integrally connected with the stirrup  

 
(6), and the grid (7) is integrally connected with the legs 

(4a, 4b), the stirrup (6) and/or the anchoring support (2). 
A device according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the cross-sections of the stirrup (6) and the legs (4a, 4b) 

are essentially identical and the cross-section of the webs 
(7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e) of the grid does not exceed the cross-section 

of the stirrup (6) and the legs (4a, 4b). 
A device according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
the legs (4a, 4b) extend essentially straight and the front 

end (5) of the carrier (3) is angled upwardly by approx. 5째 
to 20째 relative to the legs (4a, 4b), and the carrier (3) 

includes an angle of more than approx. 95째 with a mounting 
plane defined by the anchoring support (2). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the front end (5) of the stirrup (3) has a preferably 

essentially cylindrical cross-section tapering (9) for 
mounting a plate (10), and the plate (10) has a fastening 

means (12) which is preferably arranged at an edge (13), 
for a captive or detachable, preferably pivotable, mounting 

at the cross-section tapering (9). 
A device according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the fastening means (12) is formed by an essentially C-shaped 

claw (14a, 14b) which is integrally formed with the 
plate (10) and which surrounds the cross-section tapering  

 
(9) at the front area (5) of the stirrup (6) with an angle 

of more than approx. 190째. 
A device according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the fastening means (12) is formed by a clip (16) which 

surrounds the cross-section tapering (9) at the front area 
(5) of the stirrup (6) and which is is connected with one 

surface (10a) of the plate (10) preferably by a pin (18) 
comprising an enlargement (17), which pin is retained by a 

recess (19) in the clip (16). 
A device according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the stirrup (6), the legs (4a, 4b) and/or the webs (7a, 7b, 

7c, 7d, 7e) of the grid (7) at the front end (5) of the 
carrier (3) have a cross-section reduction (23) at one 

side, which is dimensioned and designed in such a manner 
that the plate (10) is pivotable so as to essentially coincide 

with the circumference of the front end (5) of the 
carrier (3), with the plate (10) being adapted to the shape 

of the stirrup (6), the legs (4a, 4b) and/or the webs (7a, 
7b, 7c, 7d, 7e) of the grid (7) at the front end (5) of the 

carrier (3). 
A device according to Claim 10, characterized in that 
the stirrup (6) is provided with a stop face (26) which 

limits the pivoting range of the plate (10).  
 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the carrier (3) is provided with at least one detent (11) 

adapted to accommodate a stop (30). 
A device according to the previous claim, characterized 
in that the stop (30) has an essentially rectangular 

shape from which two pin-shaped wall sections (31a, 31b) 
protrude. 
A device according to the previous claim, characterized 
in that each detent (11a, 11b) is formed in pairs of 

detent elements (11a', 11a'', 11b', 11b'') arranged at the 
legs (4a, 4b) opposite each other, and each detent element 

(11a', 11a'', 11b', 11b'') is formed by two projections 
arranged at a distance from each other, which between them 

at least partially accommodate a wall section (31a, 31b) of 
the stop (30). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the anchoring support (2) is formed by a support frame (35) 

at which at least one anchoring element (36) with an arm 
(36a) which laterally projects beyond the carrier (3) with 

a hook (36b) is integrally formed at each side.
