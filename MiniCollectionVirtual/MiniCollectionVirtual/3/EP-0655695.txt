<ABSTRACT>
An image filing apparatus comprises a read unit to 
read an image of an original, a judgment unit to judge 

whether the original read by the reading means is a 
specific original or not, an extraction unit to extract 

the image of a specific area of the original which was 
judged as a specific original by the judgment unit, a 

setting unit to set the image extracted by the 
extraction unit as a title of the original which is not 

judged as a specific original by the judgment unit, a 
storage unit to store the image which is not judged as 

a specific original to a memory medium, and a forming 
unit to form a management table in which the title set 

by the setting means and the storing address of the 
image to be stored in the memory medium are made 

correspond to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image filing apparatus
to store an image onto a memory medium.Hitherto, there exists a document image information
processing apparatus in which document information called
an electronic file or the like is converted to electric
information by a photoelectric converting device such as a
CCD or the like (General examples of such document imaging
apparatuses are described in EP-A-0 435 314, EP-A-0 435 316, EP-A-0
251 237 and
US-A-5 179 649). The electric information is stored to a
memory medium such as an optical disc or the like, and the
information in the memory medium is retrieved later and is
displayed by a display device or is outputted to a printer
or the like.In such an apparatus, generally, when a document is
read, a key word such as a document name or the like is
inputted as an index by the operator from a keyboard or the
like associated with the apparatus, thereby preparing for a
subsequent retrieval.In the conventional document image information
processing apparatus as mentioned above, when the document
is read, the operator needs to input the key word such as a
document name or the like from the keyboard or the like.
First, the operator who is not 
familiar with the keyboard has to execute a troublesome
work each time one document is read.The conventional document image information
processing apparatus also has the following problems.A time point when a document occurs, namely, a
time point when the user himself forms a document or
when he reads the received document is generally a
timing at which the most proper index can be presumed.
However, the document cannot be always read to the
apparatus at such a time point.That is, such a situation occurs in the case where
the apparatus is installed at a remote location, where
another user uses the apparatus, where there is no time
to perform the reading operation, or the like. In such
a case, the document is read to the apparatus at a time
point after the time point when the document occurred.Since the document name or index is inputted from
the keyboard or the like at a time point when the
document is read to the apparatus as mentioned above,
in case of reading the document to the apparatus with a
time delay from the time point of the occurrence of the
document as mentioned above, it is difficult to add the
optimum index to the document. There occurs a
necessity to again read the document for only the
purpose to consider the index case by case.It is an object of the invention to provide an
image filing apparatus which can
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image filing apparatus comprising:

reading means (
36
) for inputting images from devices
(
111
, 
111a, 111b
) which read images of a predefined
document name registration sheet (
200
) and subsequently of
a document consisting of a bundle of originals (
1
);
storing means (
27
) for storing the document images
read by said reading means to a memory medium (
35
), said
memory medium comprising a management table (
FAT
);
processing and control means (
10
) for setting a name
of the document, the images of which are stored in said

memory medium, by extracting an image of a document name
column (
203
) of the predefined document name registration
sheet read by said reading means;
forming means (
10
) for forming said management table
(
FAT
) in which the document name set by said processing and
control means and a storage address of said document images

are made correspond to each other;
input means (
35, 37
) for inputting a desired document
name;
retrieval means (
10
) for retrieving the document
images stored in said memory medium, which are determined

to correspond to said desired document name in using said
management table; and
display means (
32
) for displaying a graphic document
name in a name list;

   
characterized in that
 
   said processing and control means sets the extracted

image of said document name column as a graphic document
name of the document images and causes said display means

(
32
) to display said extracted image corresponding to the
document images retrieved by said retrieval means as said

graphic document name.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that said
 input means (
37
) are usable for inputting a
character code; wherein said processing and control means

handles the input character code as a name of the document
images.
An apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 said processing and control means controls the display
device to display a mixture of the graphic document name

and the character code input by said input means in the
name list.
An apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that,
 when said processing and control means handled both
the extracted image and the character code to the identical

document image, said processing and control means controls
the display device to display the character code in the

name list.
