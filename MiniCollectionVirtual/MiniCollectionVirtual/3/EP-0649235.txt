<ABSTRACT>
An equalizer (36) compensates for changing transmission characteristics of a 
communication channel by changing the number of prior symbols, and the value of 

coefficients that it uses to filter a received signal. The number of prior symbols, and the 
value of the coefficients are determined using a set of training symbols that are received 

from the communication channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communications; more specifically, to 
equalization of a communication channel. Information is typically passed over a communication channel in the 
form of a signal that represents a symbol from a known symbol constellation. The 
transmission characteristics of the communication channel alter the signal and make 
it difficult to identify the symbol at a receiver. In the past, adaptive filters were used as channel equalizers to 
compensate for the transmission characteristics of a communication channel. The 
communication channel may be a wireless channel or a wired channel. FIG. 1 
illustrates a prior channel equalizer. A received signal passes through analog-to-digital 
(A/D) converter 10 and into a shift register or RAM 12. Shift register 12 is 
broken into nine segments in this example. The nine segments consist of three 
groups of three segments, where each group of three segments correspond to a 
symbol period. As a result, shift register 12 stores two prior symbols and the current 
symbol, with three samples of each symbol. Each sample contained in the shift 
register is multiplied by a coefficient C using one of multipliers 14. The outputs of 
multipliers 14 are summed in adder 16. Adder 16 provides its output, which may be 
complex, to decision unit 18. Decision unit 18 identifies the symbol Sk by 
determining which symbol in the symbol constellation most closely matches the 
signal received from summer 16. Decision unit 18 is well-known in the art and is 
sometimes referred to as a slicer in modem applications. It should be noted that the 
equalizer of FIG. 1 is considered a fractionally-spaced equalizer because it samples 
the incoming signal at a rate faster than the symbol rate. As a result of having 
several samples per symbol, a fractionally-spaced equalizer is less sensitive to the 
phase variations in the incoming signal. It should also be noted that the equalizer of 
FIG. 1 is adaptive in that the coefficients C are changed based on changing channel 
conditions. For the sake of simplicity, the mechanism for changing the coefficients 
is not shown. A similar fractionally spaced equalizer is disclosed in "Fractional 
Tap-Spacing Equalizer and Consequences for Clock Recovery in Data Modems" by 
Gottfried Ungerboeck, IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. Com-24 No. 8, 
August 1976, pp. 856 - 64.  The equalizer of FIG. 1 has the advantage of modifying the value of 
coefficients C based on changing communication channel characteristic. The

<CLAIMS>
A method for identifying symbols represented by a received signal from a 
communication channel characterized by the steps of: 

   sampling said received signal when said signal represents a first symbol to 
produce a first initial sample; 

   sampling said received signal when said signal represents a second symbol to 
produce a second initial sample; 

   using said initial samples to determine a first number; 
   sampling said received signal when said signal represents a third symbol to form a 

third symbol sample; and 
   using said first number of previous symbols and said third symbol sample to 

identify said third symbol. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that said step of sampling said 
received signal when said signal represents a first initial symbol comprises taking m 

samples of said signal to produce a first initial vector comprising m first initial samples, 
and further characterized by the step of using said first initial vector to form a first 

autocorrelation matrix. 
The method of claim 2, characterized in that said step of sampling said 
received signal when said signal represents a second initial symbol comprises taking m 

samples of said signal to produce a second initial training vector comprising m second 
initial samples, and further characterized by the step of using said second initial vector to 

form a second auto-correlation matrix. 
The method of claim 3, further characterized by the step of forming a time 
averaged autocorrelation matrix by summing said first and said second autocorrelation 

matrices. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that using said first number of 
previous symbols comprises forming a plurality of products by multiplying each of said 

previous symbols by a coefficient. 
The method of claim 7, further characterized by forming a sum of said 
products and subtracting said sum from said third symbol sample. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that said step of sampling said 
received signal when said signal represents a third symbol comprises taking m samples of 

said signal to form a third symbol vector. 
The method of claim 9, further characterized by the step of forming said first 
number of product vectors by multiplying said first number of previous symbols by a m 

entry matrix. 
The method of claim 10, further characterized by the step of summing said first 
number of product vectors to produce a sum vector and subtracting said sum vector from 

said third symbol vector. 
The method of claim 9, characterized in that said step of using first number of 
previous symbols and said third symbol vector to identify said third symbol comprises 

using a third number of coefficients, where said third number is the product of m and said 
second number.
