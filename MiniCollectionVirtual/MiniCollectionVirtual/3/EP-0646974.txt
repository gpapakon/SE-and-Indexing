<ABSTRACT>
Method for the preparation of a precursor for a 
superconductor, comprising the addition of a condensation 

product to an aqueous solution of metal salts, the total or 
partial removal of water from the mixture thus obtained, the 

subsequent processing of the viscous mass obtained after having 
removed part of the water or the calcination of the solid gel 

obtained after having substantially removed all the water, 
wherein the condensation product is a product of esterification 

of citric acid with ethylene glycol prepared separately and the 
solution of metal salts substantially is a solution of acetates 

in water and acetic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing 
precursors for superconductors based on ceramic oxides. As it is well known, superconductors are metals, alloys, 
oxides and, in general, compounds which have a drop in 
resistance up to values which are substantially nil at a 
temperature value known as the critical temperature of 
supercunductivity (Tc) which is characteristic of each 
superconductor. During the last few years, different preparation methods for 
the most promising superconductor oxides have been studied and 
worked out. Among these are the YBCO (in the Y-Ba-Cu-O system, 
also known as 123, 124, etc. depending on the relative ratios 
of the metallic elements in the molecule), the BSCCO 
(Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O - also known as 2212 and 2223 depending on the 
structure of the crystalline phase - and/or Bi(Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O), 
sometimes the latter ones being also specifically identified as 
BPSCCO (Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O or BI, PB-Sr-Ca-Cu-O or 
Bi(Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O). It is also to be noted that the 
superconductive properties of these compounds are extremely 
sensitive even to small variations of their average 
stoichiometry (both for the metallic elements and their 
substituents, and for the oxygen content and other possible non 
metallic elements), as well as of their structural homogeneity.  
 
For instance, in some cases it is preferable to produce 
materials having a slightly changed composition in comparison 
with the abovementioned nominal compositions, or which comprise 
more than one crystalline phase. In any case, the possibility 
to actually produce a material having the desired composition 
is a very important feature of a method. In general, the preparation of superconductors based on 
oxides comprise: 
1) the preparation of a mixed oxide or of a finely blended 
mixture of oxides and sometimes also of other compounds capable 
of forming oxides by means of thermal treatments at 
sufficiently high temperatures, wherein the essential 
(metallic) elements are already present in the desired ratios 
and finely mixed (hereinafter referred to as "precursor for the 
superconductor"), it being capable of being transformed, 
essentially owing to the reactions occuring in the solid state 
when increasing the temperature, in the superconductive phase 
or phases; 2) the thermal treatment of the above mentioned precursor aimed 
at forming the superconductive (crystalline) phase. In practice, steps (1) and (2) are followed by (3) the step 
of integration of the superconductive phase with a support 
(usually
