<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a pharmaceutical composition 
having improved oral absorption ability and reduced 

bitterness comprising (-)-(6R,7R)-2,2-dimethylpropionyloxymethyl 
7-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-thiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]
-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]
oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate (to be 
referred to as "cefditoren pivoxil" hereinafter). 
The combination use of cefditoren pivoxil and 
hydroxypropylcellulose makes it possible to produce the 

pharmaceutical composition comprising cefditoren pivoxil as 
an active ingredient, having excellent oral absorption 

ability and reduced bitterness. Hydroxypropylcellulose is 

blended with cefditoren pivoxil in a weight ratio of 0.4 or 
more, preferably 0.8 to 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
composition for oral administration use having excellent oral 
absorption ability and less bitterness, which comprises 
cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylcellulose. Cefditoren pivoxil is a novel prodrug, (-)-(6R,7R)-2,2-dimethylpropionyloxymethyl 
7-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-thiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate, 
which has been prepared by ester bonding of a 
(pivaloyl)oxymethyl group to the 4-position carboxylic acid 
of an antibiotic, (+)-(6R,7R)-7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-glyoxyamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl)vinyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, 7Â²-(Z)-(O-methyloxime) 
(to be referred to as "cefditoren" 
hereinafter), having broad antibacterial spectrum with the 
aim of providing the antibiotic with oral absorption ability 
[K. Sakagami et al., J. Antibiot., 43, 1047-1050 (1990)]. It is considered in general that an increase in the 
fat-solubility of a drug by esterification leads to 
acceleration of its membrane permeability in gastrointestinal 
tracts and results in improvement of its absorption ability 
from the gastrointestinal tracts. However, absorption  
 
ability of drugs is closely related to their solubility and 
an increase in fat-solubility due to esterification reduces 
properties such as water wettability, dispersibility, 
solubility and the like. Thus, there is a serious drawback 
in that satisfactory improvement in the absorption ability 
cannot always be attained by such a means. In order to 
overcome such a problem, attempts have been made in recent 
years to improve absorption ability of drugs using 
solubilizing agents such as organic acids, cyclodextrin and 
the like [T. Kikkoji et al., Yakuzaigaku, 52, 120-127 (1992) 
and JP-A-1-268637; the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
unexamined published Japanese patent application"]. 
However, when an organic acid is used, its strong acidity 
causes difficulty in taking drugs. The use of cyclodextrin 
also causes another serious problem in terms of drug-taking, 
because it forms a water soluble complex with cefditoren 
pivoxil and the complex formation entails a sharp increase in 
the solubility of the drug itself and hence considerable 
amplification of the drug-inherent bitterness. It is possible to a certain degree to solve such 
problems by applying film coating to the surface of tablets 
and granules. At the time of actual clinical or domestic 
drug-taking,
