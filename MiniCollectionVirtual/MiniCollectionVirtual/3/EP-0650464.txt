<ABSTRACT>
An improved bottled water station (10) includes a removable reservoir (14) for drop-in installation into and lift-out removal from a station housing (20). The reservoir (14) is constructed from a lightweight molded plastic or the like to have an open upper end for receiving and supporting an inverted water bottle (12). A bottom wall on the reservoir (14) includes an upwardly recessed portion defining an inverted receiver cup (74) for slide-fit reception of a chiller probe (16) provided as part of a refrigeration system (22) on the station housing. One or more faucet valves (50, 52) are provided to extend through openings (48) in a front wall (24) of the station housing (20) for dispensing water from the reservoir (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dispenser
according to the preamble of claim 1.This invention relates in particular to
improvements in bottled water stations of the type
adapted to receive and support a water bottle in an
inverted position, and to selectively dispense water
therefrom. More specifically, this invention relates
to an improved bottled water station having a
removable water-containing reservoir adapted for
simple drop-in installation into a station housing,
wherein the reservoir and station housing include
vapor seal means for substantially eliminating or
preventing formation of undesired condensation and/or
frost on the exterior of the water reservoir.Bottled water dispenser stations are
well-known in the art for containing a supply of
relatively purified water in a convenient manner and
location ready for substantially immediate dispensing 
and use. Such bottled water stations commonly
include an upwardly open reservoir mounted on a
station housing and adapted to receive and support an
inverted water bottle of typically three to five
gallon capacity. Water within the inverted bottle
flows downwardly into the station reservoir for
selective dispensing therefrom through one or more
faucet valves on the front of the station housing.
Such bottled water stations are widely used to
provide a clean and safe source of water for drinking
and cooking, especially in areas where the local
water supply is suspected to contain undesired levels
of contaminants.In bottled water stations of the
above-described type, the water bottles are normally
provided by a vendor in a clean and preferably
sterile condition with an appropriate sealed cap to
prevent contamination of the water contained
therein. When an inverted bottle on a station
housing reaches an empty condition, the empty bottle
can be lifted quickly and easily from the station
housing and replaced by a filled bottle having the
sealing cap removed therefrom. The empty bottle can
then be returned to the bottled water vendor for
cleaning and refilling.Although bottled water stations of this type
utilize a sequence of water bottles which have been
individually sanitized, the water reservoir within
the station housing has not be subjected to periodic
cleaning or replacement. In this regard, the housing
reservoir typically comprises a metal or ceramic tank
mounted within the station housing in association
with a refrigeration system having a chiller coil for
maintaining water within the reservoir in a chilled
condition. In some station housing designs, the

A water station (10) comprising:

a reservoir (14) having a hollow interior for receiving and storing a supply
of water, said reservoir (14) having a bottom wall (72) with an inverted receiver

cup (74) formed therein such as to protrude into the volumetric space of the
reservoir;
a station housing (20) having support means (44, 45) for receiving and
supporting said reservoir (14);
a chiller probe (16) mounted within said station housing (20) and
projecting upwardly from said support means (44, 45) for slide-fit reception into

said receiver cup (74) when said reservoir (14) is mounted within said station
housing (20), said chiller probe (16) defining a chilled surface (32) for contacting

said reservoir (14) to chill water within said reservoir (14); and
faucet means (50, 52) for dispensing water from said reservoir (14)
characterised in that

the receiver cup (74) is formed without
providing any open flow port therethrough and

there is provided vapour seal means (18, 118, 218) for
preventing air circulation between said receiver cup (74) and said chiller probe

(16) when said reservoir (14) is mounted within said station housing (20).
The water station of claim 1 wherein said housing support means (44, 45)
defines an upwardly open cavity for drop-in installation and slide-out removal of

said reservoir (14). 
The water station of claim 2 including insulation means (44, 45) within
said cavity and defining an upwardly open insulated receptacle for receiving at

least a portion of said reservoir (14).
The water station of claim 3 wherein said vapour seal means (18, 118, 218)
comprises a seal ring (18) formed on said reservoir bottom wall (72) and

projecting downwardly therefrom in a position surrounding a lower end of said
receiver cup (74) for press-fit engagement with said insulation means (44, 45)

when said reservoir (14) is mounted within said station housing (20).
The water station of claim 1 wherein said vapour seal means (18, 118, 218)
comprises a seal ring (118) mounted on said reservoir generally at a lower end of

said receiver cup (74) and defining a radially inwardly projecting seal lip for
engagement with said probe (16) when said reservoir (14) is mounted within said

station housing (20).
The water station of claim 1 wherein said vapour seal means (18, 118, 218)
comprises a thermal heat transfer material (218) occupying residual space

between said receiver cup (74) and said probe (16) when said reservoir (14) is
mounted within said station housing (20). 
The water station of claim 1 wherein said reservoir (14) is adapted to
receive the supply of water from an inverted water bottle (12) mounted on said

station housing.
The water station of claim 1 wherein said station housing includes a front
wall (24) having at least one faucet port (48) formed therein, and further wherein

said reservoir (14) has a front wall with at least one faucet fitting (66) mounted
thereon in a position for general alignment with said faucet port (48) when said

reservoir (14) is mounted within said station housing (20), said faucet means (50,
52) including a faucet (50, 52) removably mounted through said faucet port (48) to

said faucet fitting (66).
The water station of claim 1 wherein said chiller probe (16) comprises a
probe shell (32) having a temperature control element (30) therein, and a thermal

heat transfer material (40) within said probe shell (32) substantially filling the
residual space between said temperature control element (30) and said probe shell

(32).
The water station of claim 9 wherein said temperature control element (30)
comprises a chiller coil (30). 
The water station of claim 9 wherein said probe shell (32) is formed from a
plastic material.
The water station of claim 11 further including a conductive metal heat
transfer plate (41) mounted within said probe shell (32) between said temperature

control element (30) and one end of said probe shell.
