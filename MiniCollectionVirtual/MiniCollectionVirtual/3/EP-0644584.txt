<ABSTRACT>
In a step of forming a through-hole through an 
oxidation film in dry-etching the oxidation film by using 

fluorocarbon, a deposition film is formed on an etching surface 
to include carbon of more than 50%, preferably 80%, and fluorine 

of less than 50%, preferably 20%. Thus, a high 
selectivities to silicon, silicon nitride and titanium nitride 

are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for fabricating a 
semiconductor device, and more particularly to, the improvement 
on selectivity in etching an oxidation film in a method for 
fabricating a semiconductor device. One of conventional processes for etching an oxidation 
film in the fabrication of a semiconductor device is a dry-etching 
process in which fluorocarbon gas is used. As the 
fluorocarbon gas, carbon quaternary-fluoride, methane trifluoride, 
mixed gas of these gases, or the mixed gas added with 
argon, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. is used. Selectivity to a under layer is important in the 
oxidation film etching process. As the under layer, 
silicon, silicon nitride, titanium nitride, etc. are used. 
Such selective etching to silicon is described on page 1585 of 
"J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A5(4), July/August, 1987". In this 
report, it is explained that in a dry-etching process of an 
oxidation film using fluorocarbon gas, a deposition film formed 
from carbon and fluorine is deposited to provide a selectivity 
in accordance With the suppression of etching. On the 
contrary, it is explained that the suppression of etching is 
hindered due to the removal of the deposition film caused by the 
reaction of carbon and oxygen contained in the film.  
 
Further, it is reported that the selectivity is largely dependent 
on the deposition film thickness, so that a high selectivity is 
obtained as a thickness of the deposition film is large. As explained above, it is known that a fluorocarbon 
film composed of carbon and fluorine functions as a key factor 
in the selective etching of an oxidation film. Another conventional etching process is described in 
the Japanese Patent Kokai No. 3-163824 in which an organic 
substance including no-saturated bond is added in the etching of 
an oxidation film, and the organic substance is deposited on the 
surface of silicon, so that the etching thereof is avoided. However, the former conventional process for etching 
an oxidation film has a disadvantage in that a selectivity to 
silicon is not obtained to be sufficiently high, and it is 
practically approximately 20. On the other hand, the 
selectivity is approximately only 2 to silicon nitride, and only 
4 to titanium nitride. In this manner, it is impossible that 
a high selectivity is obtained in the etching of an oxidation 
film on which a deposition film including fluorine of more than 
50% is deposited. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to 
provide a method for fabricating a semiconductor device in which
