<ABSTRACT>
The present gun has a triple electrodes part (20), a 
prefocusing lens part (30) for preliminarily focusing and 

accelerating the electron beam from the triple electrodes 
part, and a main lens part (40) for finally focusing and 

accelerating the beam from the prefocusing lens part. 
The prefocusing lens part (30) comprises a plurality of 
focusing lenses for forming at least one quadrapole lens, 

and two different focusing voltages (F1,F2) each of which being 
dynamically changed synchronized with the deflection 

signal, are selectively applied to each focusing 
electrodes. Thus, a uniform beam section can be 

obtained all over the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron gun for 
a color picture tube, and particularly to a gun improved 
in a method for applying voltages to component 
electrodes of the gun. In a conventional picture tube, electron beams 
emitted from an electron gun fabricated in the neck of 
the tube, are selectively landed on a phosphor screen to 
form an image, after being deflected by a deflection 
yoke according to their scan positions. It is, therefore, most important to make the electron 
beam emitted from the gun be precisely landed at a 
prescribed position in the screen, to form better image. When the beam is deflected to the perpheral part of 
the screen, the beam is effected by the non-uniform 
magnetic field of the deflection yoke, to result a 
enlarged and deformed landing spot on the screen, thus  
 
reveals a poor focusing. This phenomenon severely 
spoils the resolution of high-definition TV, such as an 
HDTV or an WIDE VISION. To settle the above problem, the dynamic focusing 
is conventionaly adopted, which utilizes a quadrapole 
lens for deforming the section of electron beams to the 
opposite direction of the non-uniform magnetic effect of 
the deflection yoke and varying the focus voltage of the 
beam according as the beam scans the central part and 
peripheral part of the screen. As a dynamic focusing method, there has been 
proposed a structure using one dynamic voltage and 
two focusing voltages, and a structure using two 
dynamic voltages and two focusing voltages. Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated an example 
of an electron gun for a color picture tube adopting 
dynamic focusing. The gun comprises a cathode 11, a control electrode 
12, and a screen electrode 13, each of which 
constituting triple electrodes part, and the first to fifth 
focusing electrodes 14∼18 for forming electromagnetic 
lenses for an auxilliary and main focusing system, and 
a final accelerating electrode 19 adjacent to the high 
voltage electrode 18 and forming a main lense together. Prescribed voltages are respectively applied to each 
of the above electrodes: A static voltages VS is applied  
 
to the screen electrode 13 and the second focusing 
electrode, a focusing voltage VF1 to the first and fourth 
focusing electrodes 14, 17, a dynamic focusing voltage 
VF2 based on the focusing voltage to the third and 
fifth electrodes 16, 18, and an anode voltage VA higher 
than any other voltage to the final accelerating electrode 
19. In FIG. 2, there is shown changes of the focusing 
voltage VF1 and the
