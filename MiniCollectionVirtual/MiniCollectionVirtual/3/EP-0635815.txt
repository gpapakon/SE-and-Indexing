<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display element which is provided 
with a display surface member having three or more odd display surfaces and 
is turned to select a desired one of the display surfaces. The invention also 
pertains to a display unit employing such display elements. In Japanese Pat. Laid-Open No. 794995/87 there are disclosed a 
display element having four display surfaces and a display unit using such 
display elements. The conventional display element has a display surface member with 
four display surfaces and a permanent magnet type motor mechanism. The 
display surface member is mounted on a rotor of the permanent magnet type 
motor mechanism housed therein and the four display surfaces are arranged 
side by side around the axis of the rotor. The rotor of the permanent magnet type motor mechanism has first and 
second magnet members disposed side by side lengthwise thereof and each 
having north and south poles. The first and second magnet members are each 
a bar- or plate-like member of a narrow rectangular cross section in a 
direction perpendicular to the axis of the rotor and having the north and south 
poles at its both free end faces spaced an angular distance of 180 degrees 
apart around the axis of the rotor. The bar- or platelike member is mounted 
on the rotor shaft, with the center of the former in the above-mentioned cross 
section held in agreement with the center of the rotor axis. The north and 
south poles of the second magnet members are disposed around the axis of  
 
the rotor at an angular distance of plus or minus alpha degrees (where 0 
degree is equal to or smaller than alpha degrees which is smaller than 180 
degrees) from the north and south poles of the first magnet member. Furthermore, the stator of the permanent magnet type motor mechanism 
has a first magnetic member with first and second poles which act on the 
north and south poles of the first magnet member, a second magnet member 
with third and fourth poles which act on the north and south poles of the 
second magnet member, a first excitation winding wound on the first 
magnetic member in a manner to excite the first and second poles in opposite 
polarities, and a second excitation winding wound on the second magnetic 
member in a manner to excite the third and fourth poles in opposite polarities. 
The first and second poles of the first magnetic member are disposed at an 
angular distance of 180 degrees around the rotor axis. The third and fourth 
poles of the second magnetic member are
