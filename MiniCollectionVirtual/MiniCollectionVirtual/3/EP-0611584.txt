<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for regeneration of air in a closed or substantially closed container provided with autonomous operating energy, comprising a tank (12) containing a cryogenic material used for producing the said operating energy. The device comprises a main heat exchanger (10) which operates at atmospheric pressure, for exchanging heat between the air (14) to be regenerated, on the one hand, and the cryogenic material, on the other hand, heating the cryogenic material to its operating temperature for energy production allowing the carbon dioxide contained in the air to be regenerated to be cooled, so that the carbon dioxide is converted from the gaseous state to the solid state. This device can advantageously be used for regenerating air in a submarine, making use of the heating of oxygen stored in liquid form with a view to using it as an oxidant in the engines of the submarine.

The use of apparatus for the purpose of regenerating polluted air so as to transform
it into breathable air in a closed or almost closed enclosure, said apparatus being

provided with a stand-alone source of operating energy, said apparatus comprising,
conventionally, a tank (12) containing a cryogenic material used to produce operating

energy and a main heat exchanger (10) operating at atmospheric pressure for
exchanging heat between the cryogenic material and a gaseous medium containing

carbon dioxide, said use being characterized in that the gaseous medium is constituted
by the air to be regen
erated, and in that, by heating the cryogenic material to its
energy-production operating temperature, it is possible to lower the temperature of the

air to be regenerated to a value lower than the solidification temperature of carbon
dioxide.
The use according to claim 1, characterized in that the temperature of the air to be
regenerated is lowered to a temperature of -135Â°C.
The use according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it further implements an
accessory heat exchanger (22) through which the air to be regenerated passes and

through which the regenerated air passes, so that heat is exchanged between the air to
be regenerated and the regenerated air (18) coming from the main heat exchanger (10),

so that the air to be regenerated is pre-cooled prior to entering the main heat
exchanger, and the regenerated air is pre-heated prior to being released into the

enclosure.
The use according to claim 3, characterized in that the excess water vapor in the air
to be regenerated is liquefied by passing the regenerated air through the accessory heat

exchanger (22), and in that a portion of the water recovered in this way is sent to a
humidifier (26) at the outlet of the accessory heat exchanger so as to restore suitable

humidity to the regenerated air.
The use according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it further
implements means for removing the solid carbon dioxide recovered in the main heat 

exchanger (10), which means are made up of means for heating the heat exchanger that
is not operating, of a vacuum pump, and of a compressor, the heating making it

possible to obtain a carbon dioxide vapor pressure that is sufficient for feeding the
pump, and the compressor serving to compress the carbon dioxide so as to expel it to

the outside.
The use according to any preceding claim, characterized in that the main heat
exchanger (10) also serves to condense the pollutants contained in the regenerated air.
The use according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the cryogenic
material is liquid oxygen.
The use according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the closed
enclosure is constituted by the manned quarters of a submarine propelled by an energy

source whose oxidant is oxygen stored in cryogenic form in the tank (2).
The use according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the closed
enclosure is constituted by the cockpit and/or cabin of an aircraft.
