<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle wheel (18) on which an air-inflatable tire (22) 
is mounted, comprises an air reservoir (26) and a pump unit 

(28) for selectively causing air to flow from the tire (22) 
into the reservoir (26) for deflating the tire (22), and for 

causing air to flow from the reservoir (26) into the tire (22) 
for inflating the tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vehicle wheel on which an air-inflatable 
tire is mounted, comprising an air reservoir and 
a pump unit for selectively causing air to flow from the tire 
into the reservoir for deflating the tire, and for causing air 
to flow from the reservoir into the tire for inflating the tire. The invention relates further to a tire management system 
for a vehicle, comprising such a wheel. Such a vehicle wheel and such a tire management system 
are known from DE-U-87 15 177.  
 The present invention generally relates to motor 
vehicles, and more specifically to a tire pressure management 
system for sensing and controlling the air pressure in 
the tires of a motor vehicle. The pressure to which the tires of a motor vehicle 
should be optimally inflated depends on the type of terrain 
over which the vehicle is to be driven. The pressure 
should be relatively high for hard surfaces such as paved 
roads, and relatively low for soft surfaces such as wet mud 
or loose sand. It is possible to adjust the pressures in the individual 
tires to a desired value by stopping and exiting the 
vehicle, manually inflating the tires with a pump to 
increase the pressure or manually deflating the tires by 
opening the valves and allowing air to escape to decrease 
the pressure. However, this operation is inconvenient and time 
consuming, and is especially undesirable in inclement 
weather or in an otherwise hostile environment. It also 
suffers from the serious disadvantage that it cannot be  
 
performed while the vehicle is moving. U.S. Patent No. 4,938,272, entitled "VALVE ACTUATOR 
FOR TIRE PRESSURE MANAGEMENT", issued July 3, 1990 to W. 
Sandy, Jr. et al, discloses a system including an air pump 
or compressor mounted on the vehicle body, and conduits 
leading from the compressor to valves provided in the 
vehicle wheels. The valves are remotely actuated by the 
operator from inside the vehicle to connect the compressor 
to the tires for inflation, or to connect the tires to the 
atmosphere for deflation. A disadvantage of Sandy's system is that a high 
pressure air connection including rotating wheel bearing 
air seals must be made between the conduits leading from 
the compressor and the rotating wheels. Such connections 
are difficult to construct and maintain, and a failure of 
the connections or valves will result in catastrophic 
deflation of the tires. U.S. Patent No. 4,742,857, entitled "TIRE PRESSURE 
SENSOR AND AIR SUPPLY TO MAINTAIN DESIRED TIRE PRESSURE", 
issued May 10, 1988, to S.

displaying said air pressure sensed by the sensor (38) and 
controlling the pump unit (28); and
 
   an electrical interconnection unit (46) for electrically 

interconnecting the control unit (12) with the sensor (38) 
and the pump unit (28).
