<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for press fitting rows of miniature contacts (50A, 50B, etc.) in a circuit board (34), and then projecting lower end portions of the contacts into holes of a lower connector housing, which facilitates the installation. With the upper end portions (60) of the contacts previously installed in an upper housing (40), push bars (102-106) are inserted between the lower surface (84) of the upper housing and contact mount portions (64) which are to be press fitted into circuit board holes. When the upper surface (124) of the housing is pushed down with great force, forces are transmitted through the push bars (e.g. 106) to the top of the mount portions to press the mount portions down into the circuit board holes. The push bars are then removed. Prior to inserting the lower tips (100) of the contact into the circuit board holes (66), aligner bars (120) are installed between the lower ends of pairs of contacts, to push the contact lower ends sidewardly slightly so their lower tips (100) are aligned with the circcuit board holes (66).

<DESCRIPTION>
SCEM (small computer expendability module) is a type of architecture for small computers 
wherein various small modules, often in the form of small circuit boards or "tiles", can be 
stacked at any of several selective positions on a mother board. In one architecture a 
connector must lie within a circuit board area of about 76.2 mm by 8.5 mm (three inches 
by one third inch). The connector has 400 contacts arranged in six rows in a small area. 
As a result, the contact centers must be spaced apart along each row by about one 
millimeter, necessitating the use of very small contacts. A method for installing such large 
number of miniature contacts reliably and at low cost, would be of considerable value. In the US-A-4 619 495 a connector for press-fit installation of contacts in a circuit board 
hole is disclosed. A tool is used for directly pressing on shoulders of the contacts extending 
either side-wise of the housing and/or over the top of an inner wall between rows of 
contacts within the housing, which requires additional space. In accordance with the present invention, a method for installing large 
numbers of contacts of a connector in holes of a circuit board, and a combination of a connector assembly and a circuit board according to claim 7, 
constructed to facilitate such installation, are provided, enabling 
installation accurately and at low cost. The method applies to a connector assembly on a circuit board, wherein said circuit board 
has a plurality of rows of holes and said connector assembly includes an upper housing 
with a base that has a plurality of rows of holes and a plurality of contacts with upper end 
portions for lying in said plurality of rows in said housing and a mount portion, with each 
mount portion constructed for interference fit into one of said circuit board holes, using 
contacts with said contact mount portions formed with a largely upward-facing shoulder, 
futher using an upper housing with a base formed with largely downwardly-facing lower 
surface regions around each of said contact receiving holes.  
 The method includes first, installing each said contact upper end portion into one of said 
housing holes so said upward-facing shoulder of said contact mount portion is spaced below 
the level of a corresponding one of said downwardly-facing lower surface regions to 
leave a space between them as seen in a side view, temporarily installing at least one 
push bar between a plurality of said upward-facing shoulders and said housing surface 
regions, so said push
