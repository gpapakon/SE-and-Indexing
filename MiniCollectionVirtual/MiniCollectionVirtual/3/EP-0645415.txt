<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite,
particularly one that can be used in sails and ballistic
resistant articles, which includes a network of high
strength fibers in a polyurethane matrix material.Various constructions are known for ballistic
resistant composites used in ballistic resistant articles
such as helmets, panels, and vests. These composites
display varying degrees of resistance to penetration by
high speed impact from projectiles such as BB's, bullets,
shells, shrapnel, glass fragments U.S.

91/12136 describe ballistic resistant composites which
include high strength fibers made from materials such as
extended chain ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
Typically these fibers are coated, embedded or
impregnated in a polymeric matrix material. Of
particular interest among the above disclosures is the
description of the materials that can be used for the
matrix material that is found in PCT Publication No. WO
91/12136 and at column 14, lines 48-58, of U.S. Patent
No. 5,167,876; column 4, line 65 to column 5, line 6, of
U.S. Patent No. 5,187,023; and column 5, lines 1-11 of
U.S. Patent No. 5,196,252.During production of such composites the matrix
materials must be dissolved in a solvent so that thay are
in a liquid form for application to the high strength
fibers. The solvent then must be removed, usually by
drying, in order to fabricate the composite. A problem 
with prior matrix materials is that they require organic
solvents which have a high boiling point, thus
necessitating more energy and time for removal of the
solvent. A further problem with many of the organic
solvents is that they require strict handling and
disposal procedures because of potential environmental or
health hazards.A need exists, therefore, for new matrix
materials which do not require such troublesome solvents,
but which provide at least the same level of ballistic
performance, mechanical performance and chemical
resistance as those presently used.A need also exists for a sailcloth component
that is flexible, exhibits chemical resistance to the
ambient elements such as saltwater, and has good adhesion
to other sailcloth components.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to
