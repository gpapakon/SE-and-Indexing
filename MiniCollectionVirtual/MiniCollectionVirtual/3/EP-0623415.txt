<ABSTRACT>
A method for bonding silicon-containing 
compositions to metal surfaces is disclosed wherein a coarse 

silicon-containing surface is arc-sprayed with a first 
adhesive layer (12), a second solderable layer (14), and a third solder 

(16) layer, and the arc-sprayed surface is then soldered to the 
metal surface. The method is particularly useful for 

producing silicon-containing targets for cathode sputtering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for bonding a silicon-containing composition to a metal
surface according to the preamble of claim 1, to an article for cathode sputtering silicon-containing
compositions, and to a method for manufacturing such an article according to the
preamble of claim 21.U.S. Patent No. 4,341,816 to Lauterbach et al.
discloses disc or plate shaped targets for sputtering attached
to cooling plates by plasma-spraying a surface of such targets
with a compatible adhesive layer such as nickel,
nickel/chromium, nickel/aluminum, nickel/aluminum/molybdenum,
aluminum/bronze, molybdenum, aluminum/silicon, zinc, copper or
copper/glass; and then coating the adhesive layer with a
solderable layer such as copper, copper/glass or silver; and
soldering the solderable layer onto the surface of a cooling
plate. The adhesive layer and solderable layer are applied
via plasma spraying.Silicon is difficult to wet with solder and
requires a metallization layer. It is well known in the
semiconductor industry that silicon can be metallized with
aluminum to form electrodes for solar cells or contacts on
integrated circuits. In addition, the metallization of
sputtering targets, including the use of an aluminum layer
applied to silicon by plasma spraying, is known. DE-A-3318828 discloses to apply a target material onto cathode bases for use in cathode
sputtering coating methods by arc-spraying.The present invention, as defined in claims 1, 10 and 21, involves metallizing silicon targets with
aluminum or aluminum alloys by arc-spraying.The invention will now be described with respect to particular embodiments thereof. Figure 1 is a cross-section illustrating the
silicon-containing target material 10 onto which are coated
layers of adhesive 12, solderable material 14, and soldering
alloy 16 by arc-spraying.Figure 2 is a cross-section illustrating the coated
target of Figure 1 bonded to a metal backing plate 20.Arc-spraying functions well for metallization. Instron tests
for bond strength measurements resulted in the silicon 
fracturing before the metallized bond, and cathode power tests
exceeded 200% of production levels without any solder melting.The invention involves a method of producing a
cathode for sputtering silicon and silicon compounds. The
method comprises grit blasting the silicon plate, preferably
with a coarse, angular, granular grit such as aluminum oxide,
silicon carbide, or boiler slag, which is typically an
amorphous mixture of iron, aluminum and calcium silicates. A
