<ABSTRACT>
The motor controller system controls the respective 
motors of a plurality of cooperative apparatus associated 

with a article processing system, the article processing 
system for performing a plurality of functions upon an 

article traversing the article processing system and 
comprises a motor driver board having a plurality of input 

channels and a plurality of respective output channels. The 
motors are in line communication with a respective one of 

the output channels of the motor driver board. A 
programmable microprocessor is in bus communication with the 

driver board's input channels. A plurality of sensors are 
respectively mounted to each of the apparatus and in bus 

communication with the programmable microprocessor, the 
sensors being strategically located on the apparatus to 

provide such information to the microprocessor as article 

size, position and velocity information and to provide 
apparatus operation information. The microprocessor is 

programmed such that a cycle is preformed at a desired 
frequency, each control cycle being divided into discreet 

time intervals during which respective time interval the 
microprocessor transmit motor control command information to 

the driver board for respective motors and during other of 
the time intervals the microprocessor reading information 

from the sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microprocessor controller systems and,
more particularly, to such controller systems as may be employed in the
control of real-time machine operations such as mail piece processing as known from document EP-A-0 264 502.It is known to use a microprocessor controller for the real-time
control of certain machine operations. However, such controllers have
not been fully satisfactory when employed as an over-all system
controller for real-time machine operations in such machine environments
where a plurality of machine subsystems function in a high speed
synchronous and inter-dependent manner.For example, a mail processing system may be comprised of an
envelope feeder mechanism for receiving a stack of envelopes and, in a
seriatim manner, serving up the envelope to a sealer-transport
mechanism. The sealer-transport mechanism is charged with the function
of sealing each envelope as it is caused to traverse a sealing apparatus
and to serve-up the envelope to a mailing machine. It is also known to
employ a scale mechanism interposed between the sealer-transport
mechanism and the mailing machine. The scale mechanism is charged
with the function of weighing the envelope by means of a scale, and
determining the required postage value and communicating the postage
value to a postage meter. In similar manner, a transport mechanism,
customarily integral to the scale mechanism, must assume physical
control over the envelope for positioning the envelope on the scale and
thereafter serve-up the envelope to the mailing machine.Generally, the mailing machine will include a transport mechanism
which assumes control over the envelope and delivers the envelope to a
printing station whereupon a postage meter will print a postage indicia on
the envelope. The mailing machine transport mechanism will again
assume control over the envelope and eject the envelope from the mailing
machine. As aforenoted, in the aforedescribed mail processing system,
envelopes are processed in a seriatim manner. In such mail processing
systems, it is known to provide each of the cited mechanisms with a
motor or plurality of motors to act as prime movers for the associated
mechanisms. As is known, each motor or group of motors is under the
control of a microprocessor motor controller acting through respective
driver boards. It is further known to provide a plurality of sensors
associated with the respective mechanisms for providing input
information to the respective motor controllers. The motor controllers
are programmed to

(a) apparatus for processing mail pieces 
in
seriatim,

each cycle, the controller communicates with each of the active means to determine

its status by receiving its sense signals and to issue commands to the motor means
of the active means in response to said received sense signals in accordance with

a program controlling the microprocessor means.

is divided up into discrete time periods allocated to performing particular

functions associated with the active processing apparatus means.
A mail processing system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one of
said time periods is allocated for performing background processing.
A mail processing system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one of
said time periods is not allocated but is free for performing functions on

processing means subsequently added to the system.
