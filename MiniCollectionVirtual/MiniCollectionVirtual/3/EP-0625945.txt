<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle equipped with a basic unit which comprises the driving unit as well as supply arrangements is designed to allow the space enclosed by the car body to be optimally used. Radial type engines are used to ensure a high power with a compact design of the driving unit, and when the vehicle may be selectively operated with one or two driving engines, in particular when the vehicle is a hybrid vehicle, the auxiliary and actuating devices required to operate the vehicle are integrated in the basic unit, so that they take as little space as possible on the one hand and may be pre-mounted to the maximum on the other hand. In addition, the modules of the basic unit are standardized and interchangeable.
