<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic disk unit comprises a rotor (9), on which a 
magnetic disk (18) is mounted, and which is integrally 

formed with a sleeve portion (10) of a ball bearing unit, 
or with a spindle (5) of a spindle motor for driving the 

disk, or with an inner or an outer race of the ball bearing 
unit in a disk drive unit of the magnetic disk unit, so 

that the need for alignment of the rotor with respect to 
the rotary axis of the ball bearing unit is eliminated in 

assembly of the magnetic disk unit and the rotor (9) is 
free from radial vibrations in operation whereby the 

recording density and reliability of the disk unit can be 
improved and whereby the number of parts of the magnetic 

disk unit and the number of assembly steps are reduced. 
Consequently the manufacturing cost of the magnetic disk 

unit is reduced as compared with known units.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates mainly to a magnetic disk
unit employed in office automation instruments.In a conventional disk drive unit of the magnetic
disk unit, as shown in Figure 12, a rotor on which a
magnetic disk is mounted is rotatably driven by a motor
which is generally constructed as a spindle motor.The spindle motor has a spindle mounted in a ball
bearing unit to prevent the rotor's axial and radial
vibrations. In the ball bearing unit, the spindle is
mounted in a sleeve through a radial ball bearing
constructed of an inner and an outer race, and a plurality
of balls disposed between these races.In the conventional disk drive unit, the ball
bearing unit and the rotor are separately constructed from
each other, which increases the number of parts and the
number of assembly steps required.Furthermore, in such assembly steps, it is
necessary to mount the spindle on the rotor and to align
the sleeve with a center of the ball bearing unit.
Furthermore, such alignment of the sleeve must be performed
in a precise manner. Also required to prevent the axial
and radial vibrations of the rotor are highly developed
technologies. These requirements increase production costs
of the magnetic disk unit.In addition, in the conventional spindle motor of
the disk drive unit the motor parts are separately
constructed from the ball bearing unit.Consequently, also in this respect the number of
parts and the number of assembly steps are increased in the
conventional disk drive unit. In addition, in assembly of
the disk drive unit, the alignment or centering of the
motor parts with respect to the rotary axis of the ball
bearing unit must be performed in a precise manner. These
requirements increase manufacturing costs of the magnetic
disk unit. EP-A-0425312 discloses a magnetic disk unit (disk
drive) in which a rotor carrying a magnetic disk is mounted
on a stationary spindle through the intermediary of two
ball bearings each comprising an inner race secured to the
spindle and an outer race fitted within a sleeve-like
portion of the rotor hub. This prior art is reflected by the preamble of claim 1.JP-A-4265652 discloses a disk drive in which a
rotor has an integral spindle extending within a sleeve-like
portion of the drive casing, the rotor being rotatably
mounted by means of two ball bearings acting between the
spindle and the sleeve portion, each ball bearing including
an inner race secured to the spindle and an outer race
secured within the sleeve portion. This prior art is reflected by the preamble of Claim
