<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to semiconductor 
wafer cleaning apparatus, and more particularly, to an ultrasonic 
jet cleaning apparatus for cleaning of semiconductor wafers. During the manufacture of semiconductor devices, there are 
many stages that require cleaning of a silicon wafer or 
microelectronic parts. A common method for cleaning of silicon 
wafers or microelectronic parts is to use spin clean systems or 
tools. These spin clean systems involve the use of a high 
pressure water jet, on the order of 1200 psi., the high pressure 
water jet being vertically directed and incident upon a rotating 
part to be cleaned, the part being positioned therein below. The 
part is typically disposed in a plane which is at right angles to 
the incident jet stream. The nozzle of the jet is attached to a 
reciprocating arm so that the entire part can be accessed. 
Often, the high pressure of the water column causes damage, 
particularly when repaired circuits are subjected to the jet 
stream. A mathematical analysis of the forces exerted by the 
conventional spin clean tool indicates very large horizontal 
forces in the region of the boundary layer of the jet at the 
cleaning plane. These forces are at times strong enough to 
destroy a repair metallurgy of the repaired circuit since typical 
circuit lines are vulnerable to shear forces. High pressure 
water jets are further disadvantageous in that high water 
pressure greatly increases the buildup of electrostatic charge, 
which, if sufficiently high, is followed by a discharge. Such 
discharges, if allowed to occur can destroy circuit elements on 
a wafer. Another disadvantage of such high pressure spin clean tools  
 
is that they are not economically well suited for a high volume 
manufacturing environment. That is, such spin clean tools 
require relatively expensive use of large quantities of ultra-pure 
deionized (DI) water and the use of high pressure filters 
necessary to maintain both a high pressure and a purity of the 
water. Additionally, nozzles of such high pressure spin clean 
tools are subject to considerable wear under the high water 
pressures and generally require frequent replacement. 
Furthermore, additional disadvantages of using such high pressure 
spin clean tools include relatively high costs associated with 
both replacement parts and physical labor required for 
replacement installation, not to mention, problems generated as 
a result of process down time. In "Spin-Clean Ultrasonic Jet Cleaner", IBM Technical
