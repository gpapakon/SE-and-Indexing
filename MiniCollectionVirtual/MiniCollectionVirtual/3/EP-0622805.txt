<ABSTRACT>
A contents addressable memory comprising an array of contents addressable 
memory cells arranged in rows and columns, each row of the array having a respective 

match line associated therewith for indicating a match if that be the case between 
address bit values of a data word or words to be retrieved from the memory and bit 

values held by the cells of the respective row, and a chain of cells associated one with 
each match line to indicate which, if there are more than one, of the match lines 

indicating a match is of the highest priority.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to contents addressable memories. In particular
although not exclusively the invention relates to contents addressable memories for use
as fully associative cache memories.In the past retrieval of data stored in random access memory (RAM) has been
carried out for example by algorithmic searching under the control of a microprocessor
from outside the memory. Since only a small part of the RAM address space could be
accessed at any one time it was necessary to sequence through all addresses until a
match was found.Contents addressable memory (CAM), on the other hand, allows the contents of
a comparand register to be compared directly with all addresses held in its address space
on a row by row basis. In some applications, however, it is quite likely that multiple
matches will occur in a contents addressable memory, and it becomes necessary to
recover a recognisable address by taking the match having the highest priority, which
priority may be ascribed, for example, on the basis of position in the memory array.
This is were a priority coder becomes important, and in many cases there is a need to
look at a large number of match lines and potentially a large number of matches. One
such scheme utilised a tree of OR and NAND gates to select match outputs from rows
which are local to each other, the resulting outputs being gated through further stages
to establish a final priority match with its address. In such a scheme having, say, 512
match lines there would need to be some five stages of logic distributed across the depth
of the array. Some schemes such as that described in the IEEE Journal of Solid - State
Circuits, volume 24, No. 4, August 1989, pages 1003 - 1013, Wade et al, "A Ternary
Content Addressable Search Engine", use a chain of gates in cascade with buffering and 
look-ahead inserted at appropriate points along the chain to minimise delays, while
others adopt a parallel approach with multi-input gates. The problem with such schemes
is that they are limited to small CAM structures if they are to perform quickly and not
take up too much chip area.According to the present invention in a contents addressable memory comprising
an array of memory cells arranged in rows and columns, means to apply address bit
values to respective columns of said memory cells for comparison with bit values held
by said cells, each row of memory cells having a respective match line associated
therewith for indicating a match or mis-match between said applied address bit values
and the bit

A contents addressable memory comprising an array of memory cells arranged
in rows and columns, means to apply address bit values to respective columns of said

memory cells for comparison with bit values held by said cells, each row of memory
cells having a respective match line (ml) associated therewith for indicating a match or

mis-match between said applied address bit values and the bit values held by the
memory cells of said row, and a priority encoder arrangement for detecting, in the event

of a plurality of indications of match, which match has the highest priority,
characterised in that the priority encoder arrangement comprises a plurality of

transmission gates (TX1) associated one with each match line (ml) of the array, the
transmission gates (TX1) being connected in a series path,with means (m20) to connect

one end of said series path to a point of reference potential, respective logic circuit
means (2, 3) to control the operation of each said transmission gate (TX1), latch means

(4, 5, TX2) operable in dependence upon the potential of said series path to provide an
enabling signal to said logic circuit means (2,3), said transmission gates (TX1) being

initially biased on by said logic circuit means (2,3) at the commencement of a priority
encoding cycle, and said logic circuit (2, 3) means being arranged to bias off during a

priority encoding cycle those transmission gates (TX1) associated with match lines (ml)
in respect of which a match is indicated, and there are provided in respect of each of said

match lines (ml) current sensing means (6) enabled by an indication of match(mi) on
the respective match line (m 1) and responsive to a connection along said series path

from the respective transmission gate (TX1) to said point of reference potential to
indicate which of a plurality of indications of match (mi) along said series path is

closest to said point of reference potential.

said match or mismatch between said applied address bit values and the bit values held
by the memory cells of the respective row.
A contents addressable memory in accordance with Claim 1, Claim 2 or Claim

conductivity type having their major current paths connected in parallel.
