assembly 11 and a toothed rail 30. The plate assembly 11 is constituted 

by at least three rotation plates 12 to 14 having a common 
rotation axis RA and each having a plurality of teeth 12a, 13a and 

14a, the rotation plates 12 to 14 being respectively formed with 
cranked through bores 12b, 13b and 14b. The toothed rail 30 is 

formed with a plurality of teeth 30a held in mesh with the teeth 12a,

their common rotation axis RA by the rotation of the rotor unit 41 

with respect to stator unit 45. The motion transforming mechanism 
thus constructed requires no external electric motor and accordingly 

is able to be more easily assembled with various systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion transforming 
mechanism for transforming a rotational motion to a 
straight motion. The motion transforming mechanism of this kind for 
transforming the rotation motion to the straight motion is utilized 
widely in the mechanical fields as a fundamental mechanical structure 
and for example is represented by a so-called rack-and-pinion 
structure consisting of a rack and a pinion held in mesh with each 
other. The rack-and-pinion structure is so constructed that the 
rotational motion of the pinion is transformed to the straight motion 
of the rack by way of a small number, for instance, "1" or "2" of 
teeth of the rack and the pinion meshing with one another. As a 
consequence, the rack and the pinion are inevitably required to 
become large in width in order to obtain a large thrust force for 
moving the rack with respect to the pinion. This results in such a 
drawback that the rack-and-pinion structure cannot avoid to become 
large in size. In view of the foregoing drawback, there has so far 
been proposed by the present applicant a prior-art motion transforming 
mechanism disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 
No. 4-160258 (and in EP-A-0 482 827 of the same Patent Family). This prior-art disclosure forms the basis for the preamble of Claim 1, and the mechanism disclosed is 
shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 7 is a fragmentary 
schematic view showing an outline construction of the prior-art 
motion transforming mechanism and Fig. 8 is drawn for explaining 
the motion of the motion transforming mechanism. In Figs. 7 and 8, 
the motion transforming mechanism comprises a first rotation shaft 1 
driven by an electric motor not shown, three movable plates 2 to 4  
 
each formed with a plurality of teeth 2a-2b, 3a-3b and 4a-4b and 
rotatably supported by the first rotation shaft 1, a toothed straight 
rail 6 formed with a plurality of teeth 6a held in mesh with the 
teeth 2a-2b, 3a-3b and 4a-4b of the movable plates 2 to 4 and a 
second rotation shaft 8 rotatably supporting the movable plates 2 to 
4 in cooperation with the first rotation shaft 1. As will be better 
seen from Figs. 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c), the teeth 2a-2b, 3a-3b and 4a-4b 
of the movable plates 2 to 4 are in the form of semicircular shape, 
while the teeth 6a of the toothed straight rail 6 are in the form of 
wave shape. The first rotation shaft 1 is formed with three cranked 
shaft portions 1a to 1c having respective eccentric axes displaced 
from and arranged equi-angularly around the center
