<ABSTRACT>
Novel closed cooling system corrosion preventatives are disclosed. The ingredients include 
sorbitol, an alkali metal gluconate, and borax. Optionally, yellow metal corrosion inhibitors 

such as tolyltriazole may be incorporated into the formulation. The mixture is particularly 
effective in high heat flux and low conductivity closed cooling systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for the prevention of scale and corrosion on
metal surfaces in contact with water based fluids, in particular aqueous fluids,
having a conductivity of 100 micromhos or less in closed cooling or heating
systems.Closed recirculating water systems are used for a variety of heating and cooling
systems. These systems range from those used in automobile and truck
cooling systems, heating and cooling of buildings, the cooling of molten steel
in continuous casting units, the cooling of industrial process equipment, and
many other applications. In all of these systems, the prevention of scaling and
the minimization of corrosion of metal parts in contact with the heating or cooling
liquid are of paramount importance. While the liquids used in the heating 
or cooling systems are primarily aqueous, these fluids may contain in certain
instances high levels of anti-freeze compounds such as ethylene glycol. In
other instances, the cooling systems may be required to be relatively pure
aqueous fluids such as in high heat flux or low conductivity systems which are
employed in the steel industry.Many corrosion and scale inhibitors have been used in the past. Many of the
most sucessful materials have contained nitrites, molybdates, chromates, soluble
oils, amines or phosphates. Each of these components have some environmental
or safety consideration involving their use. For example nitrites are
suspected carcinogens, molybdates and chromates are heavy metals, amines
are reactive, and phosphates provide a nutrient source for algae when discharged.In addition, many of these additives, and other additives of the prior art do not
exhibit properties which modern systems now require. While prior art references
teach the separate use of gluconate and sorbitol in coolant systems, there
is no disclosure of utilizing these ingredients in combination with each other.US-A-5 330 683 discloses the use of certain sorbitol, and gluconate mixtures
which may optionally contain borates as effective corrosion and scale inhibitors
for brine based refrigeration systems. Surprisingly, when the additives of
the above patent were tested as corrosion and scale inhibitors for non-brine
systems, they performed well, at lower dosages than those required in the
above patent.DE-A-39 04 733 discloses corrosion inhibitors for protecting metals being in
contact with water, in particular in boiler water systems. The corrosion inhibitors
disclosed therein consist of tannic acid, a sugar and an aldonic acid in a
proportion
