<ABSTRACT>
A device for feeding liquid under pressure comprises a 
vessel having an operating fluid inlet, an operating fluid 

outlet, an inlet opening for the liquid to be fed under 
pressure and an outlet opening for the liquid to be fed 

under pressure; a float (3) disposed within said vessel; a 
change-over valve (120) for alternately switching the operations 

of opening and closing the operating fluid inlet and outlet (11,13) 
in response to the movement of the float; and a link 

mechanism (5). The link mechanism (5) comprises a valve operating 
rod (53) connected to the change-over valve and a compression 

spring (54) supported at one end thereof by the valve operating 
rod and adapted not to cross any fulcrum at the time of 

operation thereof, and operates to move the valve operating 
rod in a snap motion in response to the movement of the 

float. The compression spring is supported by the valve 
operating rod so that the vector of action of the 

compression spring passes onto the point connecting the 
compression spring with the valve operating rod.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for feeding 
liquid such as water, fuel or the like under pressure. The 
device for feeding liquid under pressure according to the 
invention is suitable particularly for a device for 
collecting condensate generated in a steam piping system at 
one time and sending the condensate to a boiler or some 
equipment utilizing waste heat. Most of the condensate condensed and generated in the steam 
piping system still has a substantial amount of heat. For 
effective utilization of such energy, condensate recovering 
systems are widely used in which condensate is recovered 
using a device for feeding liquid under pressure and the 
condensate is sent to a boiler or some waste heat-utilizing 
equipment to effectively utilize the waste heat. The liquid pressure-feeding device utilized in such a 
condensate recovering system functions to collect 
condensate in a sealed vessel at one time, introduce an 
operating high pressure fluid such as steam or the like  
 
into the sealed vessel by switching a change-over valve and 
forcibly discharge the condensate within the sealed vessel 
by the pressure of the operating fluid. In order to operate the liquid pressure-feeding device with 
a high efficiency, it is necessary to accumulate as much 
condensate as possible in the sealed vessel and to surely 
switch the change-over valve to introduce the high pressure 
operating fluid just at the right time. Accordingly, in most of the liquid pressure-feeding 
devices, snap mechanisms using coil springs have hitherto 
been generally employed to ensure the switching of the 
change-over valve. The liquid pressure-feeding device, in 
which the coil spring is used, is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 5,141,405. Fig. 5 shows the main construction of a snap mechanism in 
the liquid pressure-feeding device. The snap mechanism 100 
is composed of a float arm 101, a sub-arm 102 and a 
compressed coil spring 103. The float arm 101 is fitted 
for oscillating motion to a support frame 105 with a pin  
 
106, and a float 108 is secured to the front end of the 
float arm 101 at the opposite side. The sub-arm 102 is connected at its one end to the support 
frame 105 for oscillating motion with the same pin 106 as 
the float arm 101 and is connected at the other end to one 
end of the coil spring 103 with a pin 110. To the center 
of the sub-arm 102 is connected a valve operating rod 111 
with a pin 107. The valve operating rod 111 is connected 
to a change-over valve 120 shown in Fig. 6. That is, an

A device for feeding liquid under pressure comprising: 

a vessel (2) having an operating fluid inlet (13), an 
operating fluid outlet (11), an inlet (16) opening for 

the liquid to be fed under pressure and an outlet (17) 
opening for the liquid to be fed under pressure, 
a float (3) disposed within said vessel (2), 
a change-over valve (120) for alternately switching the 
operations of opening and closing the operating fluid 

inlet (13) and outlet (11) in response to the movement 
of said float (3), and 
a link mechanism which comprises a valve operating rod 
(53) connected to said change-over valve (120) and a 

compression spring (54) supported at one end thereof by 
said valve operating rod (53) and adapted not to cross 

any fulcrum at the time of operation thereof, said link 
mechanism operating to move said valve operating rod 

(53) in a snap motion in response to the movement of 
said float (3) 
characterised in that
 
said link mechanism further comprises 


i) a lever (52) which swings in the direction opposite 
the movement of said float (3), and 
ii) said compression spring (54), which is supported at 
one end thereof by said lever (52) on the end remote 

from the fulcrum for swing motion thereof, which is 
supported at the other end by said valve operating 

rod (53) so that the vector of action of said 
compression spring (54) passes onto the point 

connecting said compression spring (54) with said 
valve operating rod (53), and which is compressed 

between said lever (52) and said valve operating rod 
(53) to bring said lever (52) into a tensioned 

condition. 
A device for feeding liquid under pressure claimed in 
claim 1, wherein said valve operating rod (53) is guided by 

a plurality of guide members (48) provided with portions 
which receive an impact caused when said change-over valve 

(120) is operated, to perform the switching operation of 
said change-over valve (120).
