<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for the thermal and photolytic production of oxygen. Chlorine from acid and chlorine storage vessel (10) and liquid water are conveyed to heat exchange apparatus (05) for preheating. The gaseous chlorine and water are then further heated in reformer cell (25) by means of both thermal and photolytic energy, where they react to produce hydrogen chloride and oxygen, with equilibrium amounts of steam and chlorine. The aforementioned hydrogen chloride, oxygen, steam and chlorine are then cooled in heat exchange apparatus (05), where the condensed water acts to solvate the hydrogen chloride to dilute hydrochloric acid. Gaseous oxygen and chlorine are vented and conveyed to gas clean-up unit (100). Another embodiment of this invention is a method for the joint i) abatement of emission of a "greenhouse" gas by removing carbon dioxide from an effluent and ii) manufacture of methanol by reaction of hydrogen with carbon dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method
for the manufacture of methanol and the simultaneous
abatement of the emission of greenhouse gases.It has been known for many years that the reaction of
hydrogen with carbon monoxide over an appropriate catalyst
surface leads to the formation of numerous organic
compounds such as hydrocarbons and alcohols. More
recently, it has been found that H2 + CO2 react to produce
methanol (purity of 80-90%) with yields of about 1.3% per
pass over the catalyst. Much of this work has been
performed since 1980.US-A-4,937,059 discloses the absorption and subsequent
desorption of CO2 by contacting a CO2-containing gas with a
solid sorbent comprising an alkali metal oxide and/or
hydroxide (preferably LiOH) and lanthanum oxide and heating
the used sorbent to desorb CO2 and regenerate the sorbent.
There is no reference to the presence of water-vapor in the
CO2-containing gas and it is stated that other components of
the gas should not significantly interfere with the
sorption/desorption processes. The preferred CO2-containing
gas is a recycle gas mixture obtained after a mixture of
methane and oxygen (or air) has been contacted with the
sorbent under conditions which partially convert methane to
ethane, ethylene, C3 hydrocarbons, and carbon oxides.CA 115(7):70876g discloses the synthesis of methanol
from CO2 and H2 over a copper(II) oxide - zinc oxide
catalyst combined with ZrO2, MgO, Al2O3 or Cr2O3 under 13
atmospheres (1.3 MPa) pressure.The present invention provides a method for the joint
i) abatement of emission of a "greenhouse" gas, by removing
carbon dioxide from a water vapor-bearing effluent from
burning fossil fuel or other source of carbon dioxide and
ii) manufacture of methanol by reaction of hydrogen with
carbon dioxide. The fossil fuel could be coal or any
petroleum product, typically fuel oil. The method 
comprises a) reacting carbon dioxide in the effluent of the
burning of fossil fuel, conducting a fermentation process,
conducting municipal waste treatment process from, for
example a municipal waste treatment facility, or operating
a lime kiln, by flowing contact of the effluent with a bed
of basic metal oxide at a temperature suitable to form a
metal carbonate without removing water-vapor from the
effluent, b) then stopping the effluent flow after the bed
is substantially converted to the carbonate, and c) heating
the carbonate to a temperature suitable to release carbon
dioxide, then d) mixing the released carbon dioxide with
the hydrogen, e) passing
