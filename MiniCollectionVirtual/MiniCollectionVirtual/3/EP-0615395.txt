<ABSTRACT>
A cellular mobile communication system includes 
a plurality of base stations connected to a relay 

station (803), each base station having adaptability for 
coping with change in traffic volume within a relevant 

cell covered thereby. 
The relay station issues a 

command for lowering the power gain for the base station 
which covers a traffic-congested cell (800d) 

while raising the power gain for the base stations 
covering the neighboring cells, to 

thereby reducing the size of the traffic-congested 
cell (800d).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cellular 
mobile communication system. In the cellular mobile communication system, 
areas in which of mobile terminals are capable of 
communication are divided into a plurality of cells which 
neighbor with or partially superpose onto one another, 
wherein a plurality of mobile terminals located within a 
cell can make access concurrently to the associated one of 
base stations which are disposed on a cell-by-cell basis 
to thereby allow communications between the mobile 
terminals as well as the mobile terminals and the 
stationary or fixed terminals. In order that a number of 
mobile terminals within a given cell can make access 
concurrently to one base station which controls that cell, 
the technique for avoiding interference among the 
communication channels plays a very important role in the 
cellular mobile communication system. As the 
communication systems in which solution of the problem of 
the inter-channel interferences is tackled, there have 
heretofore been known, for example, 
(1) frequency division multiple access (FDMA) 
system, (2) time-division multiple access (TDMA) system,  
 (3) code-division multiple access (CDMA) system, and (4) hybrid system corresponding to a combination of 
the above-mentioned systems (1) to (3). According to the FDMA system, a frequency band 
used for communication with the mobile terminals is 
divided into a plurality of bands, wherein the base 
station within a given cell allocates useable bands to a 
plurality of mobile terminals, respectively, so that 
communication can be carried out without incurring 
superposition of spectrums. On the other hand, according 
to the TDMA scheme, a plurality of mobile terminals can 
perform communication with the base station in such a 
manner that signals do not temporally overlap with one 
another in a same carrier frequency band. Further, in the 
CDMA system, specific codes are allocated to the 
individual mobile terminals, respectively, wherein the 
sender station sends a signal modulated with the codes 
dispersed therein by using a same carrier frequency, while 
the receiver station identifies the desired channel by 
detecting synchronism with the code allocated to that 
station. In general, the electromagnetic wave signal 
emitted in the air undergoes attenuation as the distance 
from the sender station increases, approximately in 
proportion to a power exponent of the distance and becomes 
covered with noise in the area far away from the sender 
station. Accordingly, in the
