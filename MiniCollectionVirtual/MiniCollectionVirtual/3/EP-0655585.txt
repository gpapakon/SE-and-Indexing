<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A known heating element is designed as a radiator which is formed of a frame with a heating conduit let into it and of lateral closure plates. The heating conduit is connected thermally conductively to one of the closure plates by inserting an aluminium plate and is insulated from the opposite closure plate. This heating element is expensive to manufacture and has a low calorific output. 2.2 The heating element according to the invention has a shell 1 made of a thermally conductive, non-metallic and stress-resistant material in which the heating conduit 2 is embedded. The shell 1 is preferably made of a mixture of granulated fireclay, swelling clay and cement. This heating element is simple to fabricate and can operate without problems even at heating-water temperatures up to 100 DEG C.
