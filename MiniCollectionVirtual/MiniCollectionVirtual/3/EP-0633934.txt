<ABSTRACT>
Myc-induced cell death is inhibited in cultured cells, for example hybridoma cells, by expressing bc12. Myc-induced cell death is de-inhibited in tumour cells by administering bc12 antisense oligonucleotides. Compounds which modulate apoptosis may be detected in an assay using a proto-oncogene such as Myc.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MODIFIED CELLS AND METHOD OF TREATMENTThis invention relates to genes involved in the regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and modulation of the genes and their use in prolonging the life of cells in culture and in methods of treatment of cancer and other diseases.Human beings are large and long-lived organisms. They differentiate from a single progenitor cell into a complex multicellular organism and maintain their architecture and organisation throughout adult life and in the face of continuous adventitious injury at both physical and genetic levels. One of the abiding paradoxes of human development is how individual cells in specific tissues know what they are, where they are, and whether or not to proliferate or differentiate. In part, they get this necessary homeostatic information as short-range cues from their immediate neighbours in the form of cell-cell contacts and diffusible cytokines. However, these very localised signalling processes cannot easily explain the homeostasis and responsiveness of whole tissues. Recently, an appreciation has emerged of the role of innate cell death mechanisms in the fashioning and establishment of complex somatic architecture. The principal form of programmed cell death is apoptosis.Cancer is a disease caused by over-proliferation of individual clones of cells that arise in somatic tissues through mutation. The inappropriate and uncontrolled growth that results disrupts the normal architecture of the organism and results in death by a variety of adventitious mechanisms. Because increased cell proliferation is the most prominent feature of cancer cells, cancer has almost exclusively been considered a disease in which the controls that determine the ability of an individual cell to proliferate become damaged in some way. As such, almost all past 

investigations of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of cancer have concentrated on the machinery triggering cell proliferation (ie the dominant oncogeÏ€es) or suppressing it (the tumour suppressor or anti- oncogenes).Apoptosis is the likely mechanism of cell death in a wide range of normal and pathological situations. Apoptosis is important during development in the establishment of complex architecture in limbs, the central nervous sytem, the immune system and many other tissues. Apoptosis has been proposed as the mechanism of cell death of neurons in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and in CD4+ helper T cells in response to binding by HIV envelope glycoproteins during AIDS. In all of these latter
