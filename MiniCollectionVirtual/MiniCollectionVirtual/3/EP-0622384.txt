<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of polymeric
polyesterols by in-situ polymerization of ethylenically

unsaturated compounds in the presence of free-radical
initiators in polyesterols, which comprises carrying out

the in-situ polymerization in the presence of from 0.5 to
30% by weight, based on the polyesterol, of prepolymers

prepared by reacting fully saturated polyesterols
containing no hydrogen atoms bonded to tertiary carbon

with isocyanates.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
prepolymers are prepared by reacting base polyesterol

with isocyanate.
A polymeric polyesterol which can be prepared by
in-situ polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated

compounds in the presence of free-radical initiators,
wherein the in-situ polymerization is carried out in the

presence of from 0.5 to 30% by weight, based on the
polyesterol, of prepolymers prepared by reacting fully

saturated polyesterols containing no hydrogen atoms
bonded to tertiary carbon with isocyanates.
