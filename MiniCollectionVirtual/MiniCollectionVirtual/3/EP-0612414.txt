<ABSTRACT>
A mirau reflected light interference microscopy accessory can be adapted asa two-beam interference accessory module (12) on the objective (1) of a microscope. The accessory has a reference mirror (6) and several separating mirrors (8a-8d) arranged on a revolving disk (7). The separating mirrors (8a-8d) have special reflection/transmission characteristics (R/T-values), in particular 20/80, 35/65, 43/57 and 50/50. The reference mirror (6) has for example 85 % reflectivity. This accessory allows objects (4) having different reflection values to be observed and measured without luminosity problems.

Variable incident-light interference attachment according to Mirau, 
for attachment to a microscope between object and objective, comprising a 

reference mirror on the objective side and a carrier, which comprises a 
divider mirror and is arranged between the reference mirror and the 

object, characterised thereby that the carrier comprises several divider 
mirrors (8a to 8c), which differ in defined manner in their respective 

reflection/transmission characteristics, and means for the selectable 
positioning of one of the divider mirrors in its operative setting, in 

which it reflects a part of the incident light to the reference mirror, 
in dependence on the reflectivity of the object (4) to be investigated. 
Interference attachment according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the carrier is constructed as a revolver disc (7). 
Interference attachment according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the carrier is constructed as a linear slide. 
Interference attachment according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that at least four divider mirrors (8a to 

8c) with the following reflection/transmission characteristics:
 
   20/80, 35/65, 43/57, 50/50
 
are provided on the carrier. 
Interference attachment according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the reference mirror (6) is mounted on 

the side, which faces the objective (1), of a glass plate (5) and has a 
reflectivity of preferably 85% and that it has focussing markings. 
Interference attachment according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the glass plate (5) bearing the 

reference mirror (6) and the carrier receiving the divider mirrors (8a to 
8c) are combined as an attachment module (12) into a separate 

constructional unit with fastening means, which are so designed that the  
 

attachment is detachably fastenable - in a given case with interposition 
of a further flange part - to the objective (1). 
Interference attachment according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the attachment is so designed that the 

reference mirror (6) is exchangeable for one with a different 
reflectivity or another geometric size.
