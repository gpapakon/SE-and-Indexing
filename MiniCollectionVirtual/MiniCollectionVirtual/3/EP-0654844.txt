<ABSTRACT>
Mounting device on a vehicle aerial (antenna) for mounting the aerial in a cut-out (19) of a body panel (8), with a lower part (5) for positioning on the underside of the body panel (8), with an upper part (18) for positioning on the upper side of the body panel (8), and with means (24) for bracing the lower part and upper part in such a manner with respect to each other that the body panel (8) is secured between them, the lower part (5) being connectable to a tubular stub (1) onto which the upper part (18) is pushed. Provided on the lower part (5) and/or on the upper part (18) are a plurality of projections (14, 15, 16, 21) for engagement in the cut-out (19) of the body panel (8). The projections can form pairs whose mutual distances apart are different and between which there lies in each case that portion of the tubular stub (1) which leads through the cut-out (19) in body panels (8).

A mounting device on a vehicle aerial, for mounting the
aerial in a cutout in a vehicle body panel,


having a mounting underpart (5) for placing against the underside
of the vehicle body panel (8),
having a mounting upper part (18) for placing against the upper
side of the vehicle body panel (8),
in which arrangement the underpart (5) is to be connected to a
connecting sleeve (1) onto which the upper part (18) is pushed,
and having means (24) for tensioning the underpart (5) and upper
part (18) with respect to one another so that the vehicle body

panel (8) is clamped between them,

characterized in that a plurality of positions for projections
(14, 15, 16, 21) intended to engage in the cutout (19) in the

vehicle body panel (8) are provided on the underpart (5) and/or
on the upper part (18), which positions can produce pairs of

projections (21, 14; 21, 15; 21, 16) having different mutual
spacings, between which the portion of the connecting sleeve (1)

which leads through the cutout (19) in the vehicle body panel (8)
is situated.
A mounting device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the positions are produced by bores (17) which receive a pin

acting as a projection (14, 15, 16).
A mounting device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the projections (14, 15, 16) have a predetermined break

point on the face from which they project. 
A mounting device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that one of the projections provided on the

underpart (5) or on the upper part (18) engages in a cutout (12)
in the opposing upper part or underpart (5).
A mounting device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the remaining positions for projections (14, 15, 16) are

situated on the side of the connecting sleeve (1) which is remote
from the one projection (21).
A mounting device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the remaining positions for projections (14, 15, 16) are

provided on the underpart.
A mounting device according to one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterized in that the cutout (12) is a slot which extends

in the radial direction with respect to the centre line (6) of
the aerial.
A mounting device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the mutually facing bearing faces of the

underpart (5) and the upper part (18) have a substantially oval
outline and the positions for the projections (14, 15, 16, 21)

are located on, or in the vicinity of, the greatest diameter (13)
of the oval.
A mounting device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, provided on the underpart (5), there is

a circle of springs (10) which surrounds all the positions for
projections (14, 15, 16, 21), said springs protruding beyond the

bearing surface, facing the upper part (18), of the underpart
(7).
A mounting device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the springs (10) are leaf springs which are pressed into

holes (9) located in the underpart (5).
