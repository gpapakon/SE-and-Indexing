<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing embossed, finely-divided, thin, bright-metal particles which process comprises forming an embossed release surface (42) to at least one side of a carrier sheet (41), depositing a metal film onto the release surface so that the metal film conforms to the embossed surface, solubilizing the release surface, removing the metal film from the carrier sheet, and breaking the thin metal film into embossed particles having an average diameter of between 25 to 50 microns. The film may also take the form of an optical stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing finely divided metal
particles of which each has at least one embossed surface, of the type as indicated
in the precharacterising portion of claim 1. A method of this type is known from EP-A-0081599.Furthermore, the present invention relates to a product comprising finely
divided embossed metal particles.The use of metal coatings for decoration and ornamentation began several
thousand years ago. However, only within the last hundred years have metallic
pigments become commercially important. Historically, the value of surfaces covered
with gold or other metals resided not only in an aesthetically pleasing, bright, metallic
finish, but in the ability of such surface coatings to withstand the ravages of time and
weathering of the elements better than any other available type of surface coating
The high cost of gold or other metals, made it become difficult to produce a suitable
thin leaf, and the use of metallic coatings was limited to jewelry, porcelain, chinaware
and other art objects. To produce thin leaf or coating of metal that was only a few
thousandths of an inch thick, it was necessary to begin with a ductile metal that was
already hammered into extremely thin sheets. These sheets were then interleaved with
animal skins and further hammered until the resultant foil was fine enough to be used.
During this process the edges of the thin leaf broke off into small particles. It was
then found that by mixing these small fine flakes with a drying oil, a finish could be
obtained that came close to resembling a continuous sheet of metal. The artisans who 
worked with this type of finish on a large scale prepared their metallic pigment by
rubbing the finely hammered metal through a fine metal mesh.During the mid 1800's, Bessemer produced the first practical and economical
method to manufacture metallic flake pigments. This was accomplished by stamping
or hammering metal sheets of appropriate brightness and then reducing the sheets into
flakes which were graded and collected.Charles Hall and Paul Herroult independently invented a practical aluminum
smelting process in 1886 causing aluminum to be available in commercial quantities.
Aluminum was technically adaptable to the Bessemer process, but the drawback was
that it formed an explosive mixture with air over a wide range of metal-air ratios.In 1925, Everett Hall was granted a number of patents for producing a safe
and superior aluminum flake pigment. This Hall process, which employed a wet ball
mill,

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing finely divided metal particles,
each of which has at least one embossed surface, comprising the

steps of providing a carrier sheet having a first side and a second
side, and depositing a metal in the form of a thin film onto said

carrier sheet, passing said carrier sheet through a release
environment which causes the film to separate from the carrier

sheet but which is non-destructive of said metal, removing said
film of said metal from said carrier sheet in a particulate form to

produce metal particles, collecting the metal particles in a
solvent which is non-reactive with said metal, and breaking the

metal particles into pigment particles, 
characterized in that
 one
side of the carrier has an embossed surface comprising a

diffraction grating, in which the metal film is applied to said
embossed surface to adopt the complement of the diffraction

grating, in which said pigment particles retain surface embossments
transferred from the diffraction grating to said film.
A process as recited in Claim 1, wherein, an embossed
release coating is provided by at least one of the group which

comprises: embossing at least one side of the carrier sheet in
which the embossment on the outside surface of the release coating

is an expression of the embossment on the carrier sheet; applying

the release coating to the carrier sheet by an application means
which simultaneously embosses the outside surface of the release

coating; applying the release layer to the carrier sheet in an
impressionable state and the outside of the release layer is

embossed while the layer is still in the impressionable state; or
wherein, subsequent to the application of the release coating to

the carrier sheet, the outside surface of the release layer is
rendered impressionable by a softening means and the outside

surface is embossed. 
A process as recited in Claim 1, wherein a release layer
is applied to the carrier sheet in an amount of

said release coating of 0,405 g/m
2
 to 8,12 g/m
2
 (0.25 to 5.0 lbs. per ream) per side of said carrier sheet.
A process as recited in Claim 1, wherein the metal film
is applied in an amount from 25 to 45 nm (250 to 450 Angstroms) thickness; and

wherein the pigment particles have an average particle
size diameter between about 10 and about 50 µm (microns).
A process according to Claim 4, comprising the further
steps of:


further concentrating said metal pigment particles from
step (1) to produce a solids concentration of from 5% to 15%; and
reducing said pigment particles to a particle size
diameter between about 10 and 20 µm (microns).
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the diffraction
grating has from about 5,000 to about 11,000 grooves per cm.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein said step of
breaking said metal particles is performed by ultrasonic agitation

of said metal particles; and

   wherein said step of reducing said pigment particles is
performed by ultrasonic agitation of said pigment particles.
A product comprising finely divided embossed metal
particles, 
characterized in that
 the particles are formed by
replicating contact with an embossment on a carrier surface, the

embossment comprising a diffraction grating, the particles having
been formed as a layer of metal applied to the embossed diffraction

grating surface so that the layer adopts the complement of the
embossment, followed by separating the layer from the surface to

produce said embossed particles.

coating is applied as a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer in

a volatile carrier and is applied at 0.01 to 1 gms. of solids per
square meter of project carrier surface area.

angstroms) thickness; and wherein the particles comprise
