<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved dispensing 
closure intended to be used on containers for liquid 
products. More particularly, the improved dispensing closure 
is adapted for liquid containing containers for residential 
or domestic use. The prior art discloses a large number of dispensing 
closures for different types of products. As an example, EP-A-0 348 102 discloses a liquid 
dispensing package which includes a liquid container and a 
drainback spout fitment fitted within a dispensing opening 
in a finish at the upper end thereof. A measuring cup is 
threadedly engageable with the fitment and finish to enable 
closing off of the container. The fitment includes a 
frustoconical downwardly depending side wall surrounding the 
spout. A drainback channel between the spout and sidewall 
drains back drips to a drain opening and hence into the 
liquid container. An interlock and centering means is 
provided between the finish and fitment to center the fitment 
with respect to the finish to assist the sealing system in 
preventing leaks as well as to prevent rotation of the 
fitment when the cup is rotated out of engagement. According 
to the drawings, the measuring cup has a generally 
cylindrical side wall with a radially outwardly depending 
skirt 62. The interior wall of the skirt comprises a 
plurality of threads for engagement with corresponding 
threads on the outer wall of the container finish and of the 
outer wall of the spout fitment skirt. EP-A-0 369 560 discloses a dripless closure assembly for 
a container comprising a body which is seated in the neck of  
 
the container and which has a pouring spout. A measuring cup 
which also functions as a cap is disposed over the pouring 
spout and has a first threaded outwardly disposed skirt for 
threaded engagement with the neck of the container. A second 
skirt inward of the outer skirt and extending into the body 
is provided for preventing drips reaching the threads. EP-A-0 275 833 is directed to a plastic closure cap for 
a container, having a spout element and a cap that may serve 
as a measuring cup. The spout element forms with a 
surrounding wall an annular trough around the pouring spout 
which engages the cup edges when the cup is in closed 
position. The measuring cap has a threaded annular wall 
arranged centrally in the bottom of the cap for matching 
engagement with the tubular spout. GB-A-2 150 102 discloses a package for liquids 
comprising a container with an upwardly extending finish; a 
transition collar mounted on
