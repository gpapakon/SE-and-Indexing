<ABSTRACT>
A survey process for cable core borings in which an inner core tube (3) with an autarcally operating measuring probe (24) releasably secured via a core retaining sleeve adapter (20) is fed into a core boring rod (6) and blocked in an outer core tube (4) with a boring ring (2) via a core tube coupling (10, 11, 12, 13), measurements are taken in the open borehole by the measuring probe (24), the sensors of which look forwards through the boring ring on the withdrawal of the core boring rods (6), and temporarily stored time-dependently in the measuring probe (24), the measured depth is found by means of a rod travel indicator (1) and stored in a manner correlatable in time and, after the withdrawal of the inner core tube (3) with its measuring probe (24) secured to it, the measurements are read out from the measuring probe via a portable PC.

Surveying process for cable core borings, wherein a 
core inner pipe with an independently functioning 

measuring probe attached thereto is jetted into a 
core boring rod system and is arrested in a core 

outer pipe with a boring crown by means of a core 
pipe coupling, measurement values are recorded by 

the measuring probe and are intermediately stored 
and are read from the measuring probe after the 

withdrawal of the core inner pipe, characterised in 
that, after a core drawing procedure and withdrawal 

of the core from the inner pipe (3), a probe pipe 
(32) of the measuring probe (24) is secured via a 

core receiving sleeve adapter (20) in the lower part 
of a core receptacle (16) of the core inner pipe 

(3), the latter is then rammed and arrested and then 
the measurement values are recorded for a borehole 

survey in the free cross section by means of a 
sensor element (22) of the measuring probe (24) 

projecting through the boring crown (2) when the 
core boring rod system (6) is withdrawn and are 

intermediately stored as a function of time in the 
measuring probe (24), the respective measurement 

depth being simultaneously determined via a rod path 
recorder (1) and stored so it can be correlated over 

time, and finally the measurement value is read from 
the measuring probe (24) by means of a portable PC. 
A device for carrying out the survey process 
according to claim 1, wherein a tubular, 

independently functioning measuring probe, which 
comprises a sensor element, a power supply, an  

 
electronic element and a data store, is releasably 

connected to a core inner pipe, which can be 
anchored in a core outer pipe and which after the 

measurement has been carried out can be connected 
for recovery to a core pipe grab, which is fastened 

to a core cable, characterised in that the measuring 
probe (24) is formed by a probe pipe (32), which can 

be arranged in the core receptacle (16) of the core 
inner pipe (3) and in which the power supply (18), 

the electronic element (33) and the data store (19) 
are accommodated, by a core receiving sleeve adapter 

(20) and a sensor element (22) projecting through 
the boring crown (2) into the free borehole cross 

section and comprising an induction coil (21) and a 
guide nose (23). 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the core inner pipe (3) is formed by the core 

receptacle (16), which can be connected to the core 
receiving sleeve adapter (20) of the measuring probe 

(24), for receiving the probe pipe (32) and by a 
core pipe head (35), which comprises a flushing head 

(15) and a withdrawal housing (36), which is secured 

to the flushing head (15) so as to be adjustable via 
a threaded spindle (34) and is formed by a pivot 

bearing element (14), a landing ring (13), a bolt 
(12-) and a tap catcher (5). 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the core outer pipe (4) with the boring crown (2) 

comprises a landing shoulder (11) as an abutment for 
the landing ring (13) of the core pipe head (35) of 

the core inner pipe (3) and a locking device (10) 
for the bolt (12) of the core inner pipe (3).  

 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the boring rod system (6) can be connected to a rod 

system path recorder (1).
