Control method for a control circuit which operates in 
accordance with the principles of fuzzy logic, characterised in 

that, a plurality of control paths of differing types are 
served by only a single fuzzy controller (FR) which is 

connected to the control paths (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) on a time 
division multiplex basis. 
Control circuit which effects control using fuzzy logic, 
characterised in that, a plurality of control paths of 

differing types (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) are served by only a 
single fuzzy controller (FR) which is connected to the control 

paths (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) on a time division multiplex basis. 
Control circuit in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in 
that, the output of a first multiplexer (MUX1) is connected to 

the first input (E1) of the fuzzy controller (FR) whose output 
is connected to the input of a demultiplexer (DEMUX), that each 

output of the demultiplexer (DEMUX) is connected to the input 
of a respective control path (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) and that the 

output of each control path (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) is connected 
to a respective input of the first multiplexer (MUX1). 
Control circuit in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that, the output of a first multiplexer (MUX1) 

is connected to the first input (E1) of the fuzzy controller 
(FR) whose output is connected to the input of a demultiplexer 

(DEMUX), that each output of the demultiplexer (DEMUX) is 
connected to the input of a respective digital-analogue 

converter (DA1, DA2, ..., DAn), that a control path (RS1, RS2, 
..., RSn) follows each digital-analogue converter (DA1, DA2,  

 
..., DAn), that an analogue-digital converter (AD11, AD12, ..., 

ADn) follows each control path (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) and that 
the outputs of the analogue-digital converters AD11, AD12, ..., 

ADn) are connected to the inputs of the first multiplexer 
(MUX1). 
Control circuit in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in 
that, the output of each control path (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) is 

connected to the input of a respective differentiating element 
(D1, D2, ..., Dn), that the output of each differentiating 

element (D1, D2, ..., Dn) is connected to a respective input of 
an analogue-digital converter (AD21, AD22, ..., AD2n) and that 

the outputs of the analogue-digital converters (AD21, AD22, 
..., AD2n) are connected to the inputs of a second 

demultiplexer (DEMUX 2) whose output is connected to the second 
input (E2) of the fuzzy controller (FR). 
Control circuit in accordance with Claim 2, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterised in that, the digital control values for the 

individual control paths (RS1, RS2, ..., RSn) are stored in a 
table of values in the fuzzy controller (FR). 
Control circuit in accordance with Claim 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, 
characterised in that, the fuzzy controller (FR) is provided 

for the focusing control loop and the tracking control loop of 
an optical reproduction device or of a magneto-optic recording 

and reproduction device in order to focus the light beam which 
is scanning the data on a disc-like recording medium onto the 

recording medium and to guide it along the data tracks of the 
recording medium.
