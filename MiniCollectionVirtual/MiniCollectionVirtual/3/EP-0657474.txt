Polymers tagged with pendant fluorescent groups 
are prepared by the (trans)amidation derivatization of 

pre-existing polymers having carbonyl-type pendant 
groups. Polymers having pendant amide groups wherein 

the amide nitrogen is substituted with fluorescent 
moieties, prepared by (trans)amidation derivatization, 

with a fluorescent composition of the Formula III 

   wherein one of R₅ and R₆ may be hydrogen and 
within one of R₅ and R₆, or within R₅ and R₆ taken 

together, there is an organic fluorescent group, in the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field 
of polymer synthesis by the method of post-polymerization 
derivatization. More 
particularly, the present invention is in the technical 
field of synthesizing polymers having pendant fluorescent 
groups. In many fields that employ polymers it may be 
desirable to tag or mark such polymers to facilitate 
monitoring thereof. By the term "monitoring" is meant 
herein any type of tracing or tracking to determine 
the location or route of the polymers, and any type 
of determination of the concentration or amount of 
the polymer at any given site, including singular 
or intermittent or continuous monitoring. For instance, 
it may be desirable to monitor water treatment polymers 
in water systems, particularly industrial water systems,  
 
or to monitor polymers that may be present in waste 
fluids before disposal, particularly industrial waste 
fluids, or to monitor the polymer used for down-hole 
oil well applications, particularly the route taken 
after introduction down-hole, or to monitor polymers 
that may be present in fluids used to wash a manufactured 
product, for instance a polymer-coated product, to 
determine the amount of polymer washed or leached therefrom. 
By fluids or liquids as used herein generally is meant 
aqueous, non-aqueous, and mixed aqueous/non-aqueous 
fluid systems. As seen from the above list of possible 
applications of polymer monitoring, the purpose of such 
monitoring may be to trace or track or determine the 
level of the polymer itself, or to trace or track or 
determine the level of some substance in association 
with the polymer, or to determine some property of the 
polymer or substance in association with the polymer, 
for instance its leachability.  
 Conventional techniques for monitoring polymers 
are generally time-consuming and labor intensive, and 
often require the use of bulky and/or costly equipment. 
Most conventional polymer analysis techniques require 
the preparation of calibration curves for each type of 
polymer employed, which is time-consuming and laborious, 
particularly when a large variety of polymer chemistries 
are being employed, and the originally prepared calibration 
curves lose their accuracy if the polymer structures 
change, for instance an acrylic acid ester mer unit being 
hydrolyzed to an acrylic acid mer unit. Direct methods 
wherein the level of functional groups present in a polymer 
is determined analytically are generally not practical 
for industrial use, particularly when it is
