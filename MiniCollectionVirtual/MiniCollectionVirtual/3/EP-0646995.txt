<ABSTRACT>
A coupling device interconnects a car connector BC 
and a charger connector SC positively by a small force to 

charge a battery in an electric car. After incompletely 
coupling, when an operation lever 8 together with a grip 32 

are grasped, a sector gear 16 is turned to an anticlockwise 

direction and a pinion 15 is rotated to the anticlockwise 
direction through an intermediate gear 17. Thus a coupling 

plate 10 is moved from an advanced position to a retracted 
position through engagement of the pinion 15 and a rack 13. 

Distal ends of the coupling plates 10 are closed during 
a former movement of the plates so that windows 21 in the 

plates receive projections 22 on a connector housing of 
a car connector BC. A connector housing 2 of a charger 

connector SC together with a body 3 are drawn into the 
housing 1 during a latter movement of the plates, thereby 

completely interconnect both connectors BC and SC. When 
the lever 8 returns to an opening position, the coupling 

plate 10 is backed from the retracted position to return 
the housing 2 together with the body 3 and detach the 

housing 1. When the body 3 is pulled, both connectors BC 
and SC are separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coupling device of a
charging connector assembly for an electric car and more
particularly to a coupling device which can be operated
under a relatively small force.Electric cars will find increasing use in the
near further. As such, the problem of battery charging
must be overcome. In particular, a charging connector
assembly raises an important problem. The charging
connector assembly comprises a car connector connected
to a battery in an electric car and a charger connector
connected to a charger through a cable.A problem arises in that it is necessary to
apply a large force to the charging connector in order
to positively interconnect terminals in each connector.
If a substantial load is caused due to friction resistance
between the connectors during coupling, this may be mistaken
for complete coupling. In the case of conducting a charging
current through an assembly in an incomplete coupling state,
the terminals generate heat or may spark when the connectors
are displaced.It is important to avoid a situation whereby
a charging commences when a connector assembly is in
an incomplete coupling state. Otherwise, abnormal heat
may be generated in the assembly, oxidation due to sparks
may be caused on the terminals in the assembly, or the
assembly may impart an electrical shock to an operator.There is a conventional charging connector in which
one connector is provided on an outer periphery of an end
with a male thread and the other connector is provided on
an outer periphery with a rotatable ring which has a female
thread adapted to be engaged with the male thread. The connectors are electrically interconnected by
being opposed with the rotatable ring being rotated so as
to mate the male and female threads. The connectors are
electrically disconnected from each other by turning the
rotatable ring in a reverse direction.In the conventional connector assembly mentioned
above, the male and female threads are mated with each
other by rotation of the rotatable ring to couple both
connectors. However, coupling of thread engagement can
be easily released.In comparison with a car connector secured to the
car, the charger connector is connected to the charger
through the cable.The charging connector assembly is of a relatively
large size since a charging current is high and terminals
are made large in size to accommodate a high current. Since
the charger connector is connected to an end of the long
cable, the total weight of the connector and cable is large.
Accordingly, it is
