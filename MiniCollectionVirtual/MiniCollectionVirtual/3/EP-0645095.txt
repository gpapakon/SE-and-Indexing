<ABSTRACT>
A dog treat food product is disclosed which is extruded from a nutritionally 
balanced mixture of carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals. The dog treat 

food product exhibits improved resistance to breakage on impact by drying pieces of 
the extrudate under controlled conditions of humidity to a moisture level of between 6-10% 

by weight at a relative humidity of about 5 to about 25%, a dry bulb temperature 
of about 150 to about 250°F, a wet bulb temperature of about 105 to about 150°F and 

for at least 15 minutes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an extruded dog food 
product and in particular to an extruded dog food product 
having improved resistance to breakage on shipping and 
handling. The nutrition and health of dogs is one of the most 
important aspects of pet care. Most dog owners wish to 
provide their dogs a well-balanced and healthy diet. As 
people are becoming much more aware of their own personal 
nutrition, there is an increased awareness in the 
importance of providing balanced nutrition in the form of 
pet food and pet treats. Dogs should be fed a balanced diet combining water, 
proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins. 
Pet owners routinely treat their dogs with a variety of 
snack foods made for this purpose. Many of these snack 
foods are not nutritionally balanced for a particular 
life stage. It is therefore proposed to provide a canine 
food product that the pet owner can give to his dog as a 
treat while maintaining the balance of nutrients 
necessary for good health. In copending patent application US Serial No. 
07/899,534 filed June 16, 1992 corresponding to EP 
Application No. EP-A-0575021 there is disclosed an 
extruded animal food product having an expanded, striated 
structural matrix which when chewed by the animal 
effectively removes tartar, stain and plaque from the 
animal's teeth through a mechanical cleansing action.  
 
The extruded expanded food product has a low moisture 
content and is formed from an ingredient mixture of 
carbohydrate, fat, protein and fibre-bearing ingredients 
and nutritional balancing ingredients such as vitamins 
and minerals. In preparing the pet food product of SN 07/899,534, 
the ingredient mixture is formed into pieces by moving 
the mixture under plasticizing mechanical agitation and 
increasing levels of temperature and shear to form a 
flowable mass which is advanced through a die of 
predetermined diameter having a coefficient of friction 
no greater than 0.2 to form a continuous strand of 
product in an expanded and stratified condition. The 
product when formed into pieces exhibits strong 
structural integrity and is not subject to breakage on 
handling. When it was attempted to adapt the composition and 
process conditions of SN 07/889,534 (EP-A-0575021) to the 
manufacture of a dog treat food product, that is, a 
product that was not in a stratified condition, it was 
determined that the extruded, expanded dog treat product 
did not have sufficient structural integrity to withstand 
breakage due to drop impact, i.e., the product
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing a dog food product which 
exhibits reduced physical breakage during shipping and 

handling which comprises working a food mixture 
containing 20 to 70% by weight carbohydrate, 12 to 30% by 

weight protein, 3 to 20% by weight fat and 0.5 to 5.0% by 
weight nutritional balancing agents under 

mechanical pressure and heat sufficient to convert the 
mixture to a flowable mass, passing the mass through a 

die to obtain an expanded extrudate product, segmenting 
the extrudate into pieces and then drying the pieces to 

a final moisture content of 6.0 to 10.0% by 
weight in an atmosphere of 5 to 25% relative humidity, a 

dry bulb temperature of 66°C to 121°C (150 to 250°F), and 
a wet bulb temperature of 41°C to 66°C (105 to 150°F), 

the pieces being exposed to these drying conditions for 
a period of 20 to 120 minutes. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that 
a fibre bearing ingredient is incorporated in the food 

product. 
A method as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that 
the fibre bearing ingredient is cellulose fibre. 
A method as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 
characterised in that the fibre bearing ingredient is 

incorporated in the food mixture at a concentration of 2 
to 10% by weight. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the pieces are dried to a 

moisture content of 7 to 9% by weight.
