<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polysiloxanes,
methods for producing such polysiloxanes and high
refractive index silicone materials made from such
polysiloxanes, for example, for use in intraocular
lenses. More particularly, the invention relates to
polysiloxanes which are structured and are produced
to provide silicone materials which have an
advantageous combination of properties, including a
high refractive index, and are useful in intraocular
lenses.Intraocular lenses (IOLs) have been known for a
long time. Such lenses are surgically implanted into
the human eye to replace damaged or diseased lenses
of the eye.Whereas IOLs can be made from "hard" polymeric
or glass optical materials, soft resilient polymeric
materials comprising polysiloxane polymers or
copolymers have been increasingly used in the art for
this purpose.IOLs made from silicone polymeric materials are
preferably deformable, so that for implantation a
smaller incision needs to be surgically cut in the
eye than for the implantation of "hard" IOLs. In
this respect, the size and mechanical characteristics
of the silicone polymeric IOLs play an important
role. As it will be well understood by those skilled
in the art, for successful implantation the lens must
have sufficient structural integrity, elasticity and
elongation and small enough size to permit the 
folding for insertion through a small incision.
After insertion, the lens must, of course, regain its
original molded shape and have sufficient structural
integrity to retain such shape under normal use
conditions.It will be further understood by those skilled
in the art that the thinner is the lens, the easier
is the surgical insertion procedure. On the other
hand, in order to function as an IOL, the lens
material must have sufficient optical refractory
power. Consequently, the higher is the optical
refractive index of the silicone material, the
thinner can be the lens to obtain the same optical
refractory power.Some silicone polymeric materials described in
the prior art contain a reinforcer distributed in the
polymeric silicone resin. Usually such reinforcement
of the silicone polymeric material is necessary for
the polymeric material to attain adequate structural
strength to be used as a foldable IOL. Examples of
reinforced silicone resins suitable for use as soft
contact lenses or IOLs are described in United States
