<ABSTRACT>
The slurry subjected to aggregation processing by 
a line mixer is supplied to a slurry feed member (3) via a slurry 

supply passage (2) and then fed radially outward from slurry fed 
outlets (17) within a sedimentation tank (1). Therefore, liquid flow 

hardly takes place below the slurry feed member (3) and the 
settling velocity of the solid is increased. The slurry feed 

member (3) is arranged close to the boundary face (L₁) of the thickened 
slurry zone, and thus the settling distance of the solid is 

shortened. Accordingly, the residence time of the solid is 
shortened to a great extent. In addition, the sedimentation 

tank (1) can be constructed to be sealed and solid-liquid 
separation can be also performed under the pressurized state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of separating red mud from red mud slurry using a sedimentation
type solid-liquid separator which is arranged to perform
solid-liquid separation by utilizing the gravity of solid
(solid particles) in slurry, thus to obtain clarified liquid
and thickened slurry, and more particularly, using a sedimentation
type solid-liquid separator which has rapid sedimentation
ability capable of down-sizing the separator and increasing
the production efficiency of the separator.Conventionally, there is well known a sedimentation
type solid-liquid separator which separates slurry in which
the solid and liquid are mixed without dissolution, into
clarified liquid substantially free from solid and thickened
slurry having higher solid content by utilizing the gravity
of solid (solid particles) in slurry. This sedimentation type
solid-liquid separator is generally called a thickener, noting
that thickened slurry is obtained thereby or a clarifier,
noting that clarified liquid is obtained thereby. In
addition, a sedimentation type solid-liquid separator in which
slurry or liquid is subjected to aggregation processing is
generally called a flocculator. And generally, such a sedimentation type solid-liquid
separator is classified into the non-contact type
solid-liquid separator and the contact type solid-liquid
separator.Here, the non-contact type solid-liquid separator
is such a type of separator in which flocs (solid) are
sequentially monotonously settled and are deposited on the
bottom of the separator, and specifically, an upward-flow type
thickener (clarifier) as shown in Fig. 4 or a horizontal-flow
type flocculator as shown in Fig. 5 is well known conventionally.As shown in Fig. 4, an upward-flow type thickener
100 is substantially composed of a sedimentation tank 101, a
feed-well 102 and a peripheral gutter 103, wherein slurry is
supplied onto the upper portion of the feed-well 102. Here,
in the sedimentation tank 101, a clear liquid zone 104
composed of clarified liquid, a settling zone 105 wherein
solid is settling and a thickened slurry zone 106 wherein
solid is deposited are formed from above in turn. And clear
liquid flows out from the peripheral gutter 103, while
thickened slurry is drawn out from the bottom of the sedimentation
tank 101. In addition, the sedimentation tank 101 is
provided with a mud collecting device 107 for collecting
slurry deposited on the bottom of the tank. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5, in the
horizontal-flow type flocculator 110, after
