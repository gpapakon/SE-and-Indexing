<ABSTRACT>
[OBJECT] The present invention provides an electrical 

equipment control system for controlling the electrical 
equipment of a vehicle, capable of reducing the 

manufacturing costs of the electrical equipment and 
facilitating the modification and development of the 

electrical system of the vehicle.
 

[CONSTITUTION] An electrical equipment control system 

(10) has a central control unit (12) comprising a 
microcomputer (20) and a communication circuit (22). 

The microcomputer (20) exchanges data through the 
communication circuit (22) and a communication network 

(19) with the respective communication circuits (34, 44, 
54) of an ignition I/O unit (14), a meter I/O unit (16) 

and a flasher relay I/O unit (18) to control the I/O 
units (14, 16 and 18). The electrical equipment control 

system (10) needs only a single microcomputer (20) and a 
simple I/O port and is capable of reducing the 

manufacturing costs of the electrical equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical 
equipment control system and, more specifically, to an 
electrical equipment control system having a single 
central processing unit capable of controlling a 
plurality of electric devices of a vehicle. A vehicle is provided with a plurality of electric 
devices including ignition plugs, a speed meter and 
winkers, and these electric devices are controlled by a 
microcomputer.  
 As shown in Fig. 11 by way of example, a 
conventional control system for controlling the electric 
devices of a vehicle has a plurality of control units 
each provided with a microcomputer. As shown in Fig. 12, in a control system provided 
with a single microcomputer for controlling a plurality 
of electrical units, the output terminals of sensors and 
the input terminals of actuators are connected to the 
input/output port (hereinafter referred to as "I/O 
port") of the microcomputer. The conventional control system having a plurality 
of control units each provided with a microcomputer 
needs a plurality of microcomputers which increases the 
costs of the control system. The conventional control system provided with a 
single microcomputer for controlling a plurality of 
electrical units needs a large-scale I/O port and hence 
a large printed wiring board, and many lines connecting 
the sensors and the controlled devices to the I/O port  
 
concentrate in areas around the microcomputer to make 
the layout of a connector for connecting the I/O port 
and the lines difficult. In most cases, the central 
control unit having such a configuration must be changed 
entirely when the control system is modified or electric 
devices are added, which reduces the efficiency of 
developing activities. The generic GB-2142175 A shows a data transmission system 
between a central control unit and a plurality of local control 
units in an automobile. The central control unit sequentielly 
selects one of the local control units without any priority 
over other local control units. The EP-467 512 A2 shows a similar communication network 
for a vehicle between a central control unit and a plurality of 
peripheral control units.  
 The present invention has been made to solve such 
problems in the conventional control systems and it is 
therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
an electrical equipment control system capable of 
suppressing the increase of the manufacturing costs of 
the electrical equipment of a vehicle, of readily coping 
with changes in the specifications of the
