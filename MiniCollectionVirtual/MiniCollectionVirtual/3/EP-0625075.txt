<ABSTRACT>
A spray pump package (10) capable of delivering two or more different predetermined spray patterns or spray characteristics through two or more different spray orifices (20, 30) but at a liquid application amount per unit of area being treated which is optimum for the particular spray orifice (20, 30) selected rather than a compromise between two extremes. The predetermined spray patterns from which the end user may select may differ by any desired spray pattern or characteristic, including but not limited to: the cone angle of the spray; the width of the spray pattern; the average size of the particles in the spray; the amount of particle size deviation from the average; etc. The packages are provided with means for automatically adjusting the maximum available pump stroke so as to optimize the maximum amount of product which can be delivered on each complete pump stroke for whichever orifice is selected by the end user. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the package employs a positive displacement pump which is self priming regardless of stroke length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has relation to liquid spray dispensing
packages.In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention
has further relation to liquid spray dispensing packages which employ
a manually actuated pump to pressurize the liquid and therefore do
not require an aerosol propellant.The present invention has further relation to such liquid spray
dispensing packages wherein at least two distinct spray orifices
capable of producing dissimilar spray patterns or dissimilar spray
characteristics are provided, but wherein the maximum amount of
product which can be delivered on each complete pump stroke is
automatically adjusted to a predetermined optimum for whichever
orifice is selected by the user.The present invention has further relation to such liquid spray
dispensing packages wherein the foregoing feat is accomplished by
providing means for automatically adjusting the maximum length of
pump stroke whenever the user changes from one orifice to the other.Liquid spray dispensers of various types are well known in the
art. Many of these dispensers are of the aerosol variety wherein a
precharged gaseous propellant is used to pressurize the contents of
the package and produce a spray when an actuating means is triggered
by the end user. Typical applications for such dispensers include
spray paints, deodorants, hair sprays, adhesives, disinfectants and
the like.Because the conditions of use may vary widely for a given
product, e.g., as in the application of a spray glue to either a
large surface for overall bonding or to only a small portion of a
surface for localized bonding, it has been found desirable on some
such applications to provide aerosol packages having more than a 
single discharge orifice capable of altering the spray pattern for
the material being dispensed. This allows the user to select
whatever spray pattern best suits his or her needs in any given
circumstance by simply rotating the discharge nozzle on the package
from one orifice to another. One example of a package of this
general type is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,083,872 issued to Meshberg
on April 2, 1963. US-A-3,180,536 discloses an aerosol dispenser
employing multiple spray orifices.Unfortunately, the use of an aerosol propellant to dispense a
liquid spray can give rise to material compatibility problems between
the liquid being dispensed and the propellant. In addition,
pressurization of the dispensing package can increase the cost of
manufacture and possibly contribute to environmental problems due to
escape of

<CLAIMS>
A spray pump package (10) having a liquid pump (50) that can be
operated by a manual stroke and which will dispense a

volume of liquid through each of at least two
different spray orifices (20, 30) that exhibit different spray patterns and

which can be manually selected by the user of the package (10), said
package (10) comprising:


(a) a container (60) for housing said liquid;
(b) a liquid pump assembly (50) including an actuator assembly (40) secured to said
container (6);
(c) at least two distinct spray orifices (20, 30) secured to said
container (60) so that either spray orifice can be placed

in fluid communication with said liquid pump assembly (50);
(d) spray orifice selector means (42, 43, 44, 45) movably secured to said
container (60) to enable the user to manually place said

liquid pump assembly (50) in fluid communication with either of said
spray orifices (20, 30), characterised by
(e) means (801, 802; 1801, 1803) for automatically changing the maximum stroke
available to said liquid pump assembly (50) whenever the user

employs said spray orifice selector means (42, 43, 44, 45) to redirect
fluid communication of said liquid pump assembly (50) from one of

said spray orifices (20, 30) to the other of said spray
orifices to dispense a different maximum predetermined volume of liquid

through each of the orifices.
The spray pump package according to claim 1 wherein the liquid pump assembly (50) is a
positive displacement, self-priming pump comprising a push button actuator (41) which must be

depressed to stroke the pump. 
The spray pump package of Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said
container (60) for housing said liquid includes a discharge orifice which

is sealingly engaged by a closure.
