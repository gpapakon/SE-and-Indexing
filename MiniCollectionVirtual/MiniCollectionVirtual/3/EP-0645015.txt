<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for analyte detection, 
particularly biosensors, and a method of detecting the 
presence of an analyte. Apparatus and methods for investigating the binding of 
analytes in solution to a receptor are known. One such 
apparatus (and its associated computer control and data-processing 
means) called BIAcore (BIAcore is a trademark 
of Pharmacia Biosensor AB; BIA stands for biospecific 
interaction analysis) has been devised, which uses the 
phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to study the 
binding of analytes to receptors immobilised on a sensor 
chip. The apparatus and theoretical background are fully 
described in the literature (e.g. JÃ¶nsson et al., 1991, 
BioTechniques 11, 620-627). Essentially, the technique 
involves the immobilisation of a receptor to the special 
surface of a sensor chip, contacting the chip with a flow 
of sample containing the analyte of interest, and then 
measuring the change in the surface optical 
characteristics of the sensor chip arising from the 
binding of the analyte of interest. The specific nature of the antibody/antigen interaction  
 
means that such reactions are particularly amenable to 
investigation using the BIAcore system. For example 
Jonsson et al. (1991, cited above) disclose the use of 
high affinity antibodies for concentration determinations. 
In this system the sensor chip required regeneration with 
HCl after each assay. There are several other reported 
studies which describe, for example, the interaction of 
synthetic peptides with immobilised monoclonal antibodies 
(Altschuh et al., 1992, Biochemistry 31, 6298-6304), and 
binding reactions between immobilised monoclonals and HIV 
core protein p24 and vice versa; Karlsson et al., 1991, 
Journal of Immunological Methods 145, 229-240). Sensors for applications such as on-line monitoring of 
chromatography, fermentation or even in vivo use, should 
ideally give rapid, reversible and sensitive responses to 
changes in concentrations of proteins or other 
biomolecules. Normally antibodies have strong binding of 
antigen and can only be used as monitor of the 
concentration as a dosimeter. For such applications 
regeneration of the antibody (to recreate vacant antigen-binding 
sites), or the use of disposable items is 
required. However, in many environments regeneration with 
chemical agents can not be done. It is apparent from the prior art that for an antibody-based 
solid-phase biosensor to be capable of measuring 
reversibly (without the need for
