<ABSTRACT>
An automatic chemical analyzer utilizes reagents supplied in reagent bottles (25). The reagent bottles (25) are labeled on their bottom surfaces with an identification label (325) bearing a machine-readable identification code (326, 327, 328). The automatic chemical analyzer includes a reagent tray (15) having a plurality of tray apertures (132, 133) therein which receive coded reagent bottles (25) and which expose the bottom surface of each bottle for optical viewing of the machine-readable identification code. The analyzer further includes optical scanner means (332) positioned below the reagent tray (15) for reading the machine-readable identification code on the bottom surfaces of reagent bottles (25) within the tray apertures (132, 133). The tray apertures are selectively located over the optical scanner means (332) so that the analyzer can identify the reagent bottle (25) and the contents thereof. The identification label (325) has a spaced pair of position reference dots (326, 327) defining and orienting a label area. A plurality of bit fields surround the position reference dots (326, 327), their positions being defined by the position reference dots (326, 327). Each bit field maps to a single bit of a multi-bit binary bottle identification code. Bits dots (328) are printed in selected bit fields to define the binary value of each bit of the multi-bit binary identification code.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure pertains to clinical chemistry analyzers. It specifically pertains to an 
identification system for regent bottles used in conjunction with the testing instrument, 
including machine-readable labels affixed to the bottles. Automated analyzers have been developed for biochemical analysis of patient 
samples, such as whole blood, serum, urine, plasma and cerebral spinal fluid. Most such 
equipment available today is large, complicated to operate, and high in cost. Operating such equipment is technically complicated. It typically requires specialized 
operators to be always available. It is usually designed for use by large laboratories serving 
a wide geographic area or by a large medical facility. Existing analyzers normally carry out 
tests in a defined sequence designed for efficient, high volume usage. Such large scale capacity is not always required. This is particularly true in smaller 
medical clinic settings where large volumes of blood sample tests are not required on a daily 
basis. European Patent Application No. 0 203 659 (A1). published on 03 December 1986 
discloses identification of an object by a code field containing a dot code. The dot code has 
rotational symmetry and includes orientation corner hits within the encoded pattern area. 
The number of corner bits is dependent upon the shape of the field, which must be 
symmetrical. European Patent Application No.0 192 968 (A3), published on 03 September 1986, 
discloses a sealed reagent container for a centrifugal analyzer, the container bottom surface 
having a machine readable bar code imprinted thereon for identification of reagent material 
stored within it The present chemical analyzer meets the practical needs of smaller medical settings. 
It is a desk-top unit that can be operated without specialized laboratory training. Its capacity 
is adequate for meeting typical clinical applications. The compact nature of the analyzer can be partially attributed to a single probe arm 
and pipette servicing all of the functional liquid-handling components included within it. The 
pipette is used for transferring both samples and reagents, as well as for diluting liquids as 
needed by particular test requirements.  
 To obtain large volumes of tests, conventional laboratory analyzers are programmed 
to conduct test procedures in a fixed sequence of events. While predetermined test 
sequences are practical in high volume chemical analyzer applications, there is a need for 
more flexible operation when scaling such test procedures to
