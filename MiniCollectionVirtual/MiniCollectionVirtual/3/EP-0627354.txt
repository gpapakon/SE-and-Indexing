<ABSTRACT>
A carousel batcher-filler apparatus for filling 
containers with batched quantities of two different 

products comprising: transport means (40) for feeding 
and transporting the containers (41) to the 

inlet, inside and outside of a filling path (42-49); 
and a rotating tower (43) carrying single batching 

units situated peripherally around said tower; each 
of said batching units comprising: first funnel-like 

supplying means (51, 51a) for the supply of a first 
product, second batching bucket supplying means (64) 

for supply of a second product; conveying-filling 
hopper-like means (49) having the loading mouth (89) 

situated downstream of the aforementioned first (51, 
51a) and second (64) supplying means and the discharge 

mouth (50) leading into the containers (41) 
during their transport along said filling path; 

feeding-batching means (85, 73) for feeding second 
means (51, 51a) with a first product; and second 

feeding means (79) for feeding said supplying means 
(64) with second product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carousel batcher-filler
apparatus for filling containers with batched
quantities of two different products.At present, in order to be filled with two different
products, containers are conveyed to a first filling
device, for filling with the first product, then the
containers, partially filled, are conveyed to a
second filling device, for filling with the second
product.Each of said filling devices is provided with a
rotating drum carousel with funnel-like single
filling means located peripherally thereon, and
equipped with batch feeding system; alternatively
bucket batchers are adopted as filling means.In order to avoid bringing container to two separate
filling devices, a filler apparatus has been recently
invented, as illustrated schematically in figures
1 and 2 of the enclosed drawings.With reference to figure 1, the filler apparatus
includes a "U"-like horizontal path, indicated with
1, along which the containers 2 are filled.Said filler apparatus has a conveyor 9 that carries
the containers 2 with an endless conveyor 3 situated
over the conveyor 9.The endless conveyor 3 bears a plurality of funnels 
4 which are brought along a closed loop path that
has a "U"-like horizontal part substantially vertically
lined up with the said "U"-like filling path.The discharge mouth 5 of each funnel 4, conveyed in
the aforementioned way, is near the loading mouth 6
of a respective container 2, placed below and conveyed
along the filling "U"-like" path.Said funnels 4 and containers 2 move with the same
speed and in such a way so as to remain vertically
lined up one to another along the whole said horizontal
"U"-like filling path, delimited by an inlet
7 and an exit 8.Both the conveyor 9 for the containers 2 and the
conveyor 3 for the funnels 4 ride on a sole return
cylindrical drum 10, forming a semicircle return arc
7a-8a of said "U"-like path 1.A plurality of known batching buckets 11 are
fastened to the said drum 10, peripherally positioned
and equispaced from each other, at a level
upper than the level of the funnel 4.Said buckets 11 move along a peripheral path extending
along a semicircle arc, substantially vertically
lined up to said return semicircle arc 7a-8a of the
conveying path for the containers 2 and the funnels
4.Along said common semicircle arc 7a-8a, the discharge
mouths 12 of said hatching buckets 11 are
located over, and vertically lined up with, the
loading mouth 13 of said funnels 4, which have their 
discharge mouths vertically lined up with the loading
mouth

<CLAIMS>
Carousel batcher-filler apparatus for filling
containers with batched quantities of two different

products of the type comprising:

conveying means for feeding and conveying
containers (41) along a filling path;
a rotary tower (43);
funnel means (51,51a) located all around said
tower for supplying a first product;
bucket means (64) set
radially inward of

said first funnel
means (51,51a) for batching and supplying

a second product;
first feeding means (85,85a) for batching and feeding a
first product to said funnel means (51,51a); and
second feeding means (80) for feeding said bucket means
with a second product;
a plurality of
hopper conveying-filling means (49)

arranged with a certain pitch around the periphery of said
rotary tower (43)

each of which
has its load mouth (89) situated beneath a pair of

the above mentioned funnel (51, 51a) and bucket (64)
means, and its discharge mouth (50)

leading into a related containers (41) running along said
filling path;

said apparatus 
characterised
in
that
 said funnel means include funnels (51)
whose loading mouths are situated along an outward

periphery and funnels (51a) whose loading mouths are
situated along an inward periphery on the said

tower, with the loading mouths (53,53a) of each funnel
(51,51a) turned upwards and extending over a

circumference arc equal to a double pitch of said hoppers (49).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised
in
that

said rotating tower comprises:

a circular flange (44-48) rotatably mounted on
said rotary tower (43) for supporting said hopper

means (49) all around the peripheral edge (48) of said tower; 
an axis (55) rotatably supported by a central part
of said flange (44-48) and rising upwards;
a sleeve (57) set in screw engagement with the
axis (55) and prevented from rotation;
a plate (59) supported by said sleeve (57) for
supporting said bucket means (64) and driven to

rotate along with said flange (44-48) by means of a
driving pin (60) which is carried by either the

flange (44-48) or the plate (59) and vertically
sliding in the other;
a further plate (72) fixed to the top of said
sleeve (57) and so that it cannot rotate.
Apparatus, according to claims 1, 
characterised
in
that

said funnel means (51,51a) are
supported by said hopper means (49).
Apparatus, according to claim 1, 
characterised
in
that

said hopper means (49) comprise a hopper (49)
whose loading mouth is designed to contain the

discharge mouth (52) of the funnel means (51,51a)
and the discharge mouth of the bucket means (64);

and 
in
that
 the discharge mouth of said hopper means
(49) has a changeable size.
