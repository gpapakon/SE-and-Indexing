<ABSTRACT>
A device is shown and described for controlling movable equipment (11) such as roller doors, shutters, rolling, scissors or lowering gratings, lowering windows, sound-absorbing hoods, furnace doors and the like, the tap of a potentiometer (22) being mechanically coupled as actual value transmitter to the drive (19) of the equipment (11) and simulates the respective position of the equipment (11) by means of an electrical value, having an electrical comparison device which compares the electrical value, associated with the respective position of the equipment, from the potentiometer with an electrical prescribed value, and having switching means for switching the electric motor on and off. The comparison device comprises a discontinuous three-point controller (27) which comprises at least three functional blocks, to be specific a first functional block (27A) which determines the control deviation, a second functional block (27C) which converts the control deviation into digital directional signals (A and Z) and a third functional block (27D) having an electronic switch which connects the first functional block (27A) to the second functional block (27C) only as long as a command instruction is present, otherwise the third functional block (27D) forms an internal reference signal for the second functional block (27C), which generates an apparent equivalence of the directional signals. By this means, a simple push-button control is made possible by means of only two push-buttons and, even when the push-buttons are open, the desired value is continuously available to the controller.
