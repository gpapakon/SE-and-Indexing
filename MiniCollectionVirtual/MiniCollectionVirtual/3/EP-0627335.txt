<ABSTRACT>
The vehicle comprises at least one pair of steered (guiding) wheels (5, 5a) and means (13, 13a) making it possible, through passages of respective adjustable cross-section, to connect or isolate from each other, on the one hand, the supply lines (9, 9a) of the two loops (3, 3a) of the hydrostatic transmission and, on the other hand, the return lines (10, 10a) of the two loops (3, 3a). The vehicle further comprises means making it possible to adjust the respective cylinder capacities of the hydraulic pumps (1, 1a) of the transmission identically for the configuration for progressing in a straight line or round a bend using steered wheels and differentially for the configuration for progressing round the bend by skid steering, by combining the two types of steering, or for the configuration for pivoting about the centre of gravity of the vehicle.

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle with at least two pairs of independent wheels (5, 5a), each of them being driven by 
at least one hydraulic motor (4, 4a) which is part of a power hydrostatic transmission,
 
the input (11, 11a) of each hydraulic motor (4, 4a) being respectively linked to a hydraulic fluid 

feed pipe (9, 9a) at high pressure and to a hydraulic fluid return pipe (10, 10a) at low pressure, 
a vehicle in which the feed pipes (9) and return pipes (10) which are linked to hydraulic motors 

(4) or wheels (5), located on the first side of the vehicle form a first loop in closed circuit (3) 
while the feed pipes (9a) and return pipes (10a) linked to hydraulic motors (4a) of wheels (5a) 

located on the second side of the vehicle form a second loop in closed circuit (3a),
 
and in which each of loops (3, 3a) of the power hydrostatic transmission comprises at least 

one hydraulic pump (1, 1a) with a variable cubic capacity whose suction and discharge are 
respectively connected to return pipe(10, 10a) and feed pipe (9, 9a) of loop (3, 3a) considered; 

characterised in that the vehicle comprises at least one pair of driving wheels (5, 5a) and the 
means (13, 13a) to link through passages of respective adjustable sections, or isolate feed 

pipes (9, 8a) of both loops (3, 3a) the one from the other on the one hand, and return pipes 
(10, 10a) of both loops (3, 3a) on the other hand,
 
and characterised in that the vehicle also comprises the means enabling the adjustment of the 

respective cubic capacities of hydraulic pumps (1, 1a) in similar fashion to the configuration of 
the progression in a straight line or in the bends by means of driving wheels and differentially 

for the configuration in progression in skid-steering, by mixing both types of steering, or for 
the configuration of pivoting around the vehicle's centre of gravity.  

 
A vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that driving wheels (5, 5a) can be 
mechanically and hydraulically disengaged, each hydraulic motor (4, 4a) being preceded and 

followed by hydraulic insulators (15, 15a) and fitted with an insulator on draining (46) which 
automatically isolate when the wheel is driven by this motor or when this motor fails or when 

the reduction of the number of pairs of driving wheels is wished. 
A vehicle according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the torque and speed of 
driving wheels (5, 5a) are controlled, each hydraulic motor (4, 4a) being regulated by hydraulic 

regulator (15, 15a) mounted on the high pressure or low pressure line if one or more wheels do 
not adhere or skid.. 
A vehicle according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that one or more pairs of 
wheels can be disengaged and in that the number of pairs of driving wheels can be reduced in 

medium and high speed. 
A vehicle according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the complete transmission 
command of the said associated means and of the driving wheel orientation is managed and 

monitored by at least one microprocessor enabling the total management of all the functions 
such as : straight line, bend by driving wheels, skid-steering, pivoting, bend by mixed steering, 

skidding control, decoupling of driving wheel pairs, degraded modes, etc ... 
A vehicle according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the hydraulic motors are 
located in the wheels, the body useful volume being freed at a maximum.  

 
A vehicle according to claim 6, characterised in that the hydraulic motors in the wheels are 
high torque motors with a transmission low inertia, adapted to the phases of transient 

utilisation such as : acceleration, deceleration, starting skid-steering or bend with mixed 
steering. 
A vehicle according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the dimension of the 
transmission feeding generators is optimised by two pumps whose outputs are suited to the 

feeding need by adding the output of both pumps or by using the unique output of one 
feeding pump only, the flow rate of the second one being then directed towards the receiver 

without pressure. 
A vehicle according to claim 8, characterised in that the punctual feeding complement is 
provided by a pump already installed on the vehicle for any other function. 
A vehicle according to any of claims 8 and 9, characterised in that the feeding complement 
is provided by the pump of the ventilation driving transmission.
