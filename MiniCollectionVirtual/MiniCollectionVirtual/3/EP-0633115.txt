<ABSTRACT>
An injection-compression process for forming 
curable items (12) of elastomeric material, the process 

including: an injection stage wherein a bottom half mold 
(1) is injected by a nozzle (8) with a quantity of fluid 

elastomeric material (7) of a volume, at injection 
pressure, greater than that of the impression, the 

material (10) in excess of the volume of the impression 
being collected outside the impression, in a recess (9) 

at the injection nozzle (8) and communicating with the 
impression; and a molding stage wherein the injection 

nozzle (8) is replaced in fluidtight manner by an 
element (41) of the same shape, but without the recess 

(9), for compressing the excess material (10) into the 
impression until it sets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
injection-compression process for forming complex shaped
items of elastomeric material, possibly including a
metal reinforcing element. In particular, the present
invention relates to a process for molding bearing
seals.Items of plastic material may be either injection
or compression molded.When injection molded, a mass of pressurized
liquid resin is fed into the mold to fill an impression
of the same shape as the item being produced. This
method provides for producing even complex shaped items
to a good degree of dimensional accuracy; which result,
however, depends on maintaining the injection pressure
inside the mold cavity, and hence on the injection
nozzle remaining in communication with the impression,
throughout the time taken for the resin injected into
the mold cavity to set.The above limitation poses no problem when working 
with thermoplastic resins which are set relatively
rapidly by cooling. In the case of an elastomer, on the
other hand, wherein cross-linking and setting are
achieved relatively slowly by heating in the presence of
sulfur compounds (curing), the heat transmitted by
conduction between the mold and nozzle would also cure
the excess material inside the nozzle, thus resulting in
clogging, so that the nozzle must be cooled to keep the
material inside it below the curing temperature.The above method also preferably employs molds
with multiple impressions, thus resulting in scrap and a
high degree of thermal inertia, and, generally speaking,
in the use of complex machines with fairly long
operating cycles resulting in low output and high
production cost.In the case of rubber materials, therefore,
compression molding is preferred, which enables a
reduction in cycle time by the formation of separate
feed and molding stations. In this case, in fact, the
preformed green material, normally in the form of paste,
is introduced at a loading station through which a
number of single-impression molds are fed successively,
are supplied with the necessary material for the molding
operation, and, traveling along conveyor lines, are
closed to a predetermined pressure and fed into a
heating tunnel for curing. Though highly efficient and
cheap to run, compression molding frequently presents
technical limitations, due to failure of the green paste 
to fill highly complex shaped impressions.

<CLAIMS>
An injection-compression process for forming curable items (12) of
elastomeric material; the process comprising:


an injection stage wherein a fluid elastomeric material (7) is introduced inside
a mold form cavity (5), by means of an injection nozzle (8) formed by a first

movable mold element (40) outwardly defining part of the form cavity (5), and
in such a manner
 as to introduce substantially no overpressure into the fluid
material (7); and
a molding stage wherein the injected fluid material (7) is subjected to
predetermined pressure until it sets;
characterized in that,
 in combination:

i)- during said injection stage, there is injected into said mold form cavity (5) a
quantity of said fluid material (7) of a volume, at the injection pressure, greater

than that of a portion (11) of the form cavity (5), said portion (11) having the
same shape and volume as the item (12) being produced;
ii)- a prefixed quantity of said injected material (10), in excess of the volume of
said portion (11) of the form cavity (5) is collected outside said portion (11), in

a recess (9) formed at the injection nozzle (8), in said first movable mold
element (40), and communicating with said portion (11) of the form cavity (5);
iii)- during said molding stage, while the injected material (10) has not been
completely cured and it is therefore still fluid, said first movable element (40)

with the injection nozzle (8) is removed and replaced by a second movable mold
element (41) of the same shape but without said recess (9), and by which said 

excess material (10) is compressed in fluidtight manner into said portion (11) of
the form cavity (5);
iv)- said second movable element (41) having been provided, to the side of and
immediately adjacent to said form cavity (5), with grooves (14) for receiving a

part of the fluid material (10) in excess of the previously filled volume of said
portion (11) of the form cavity, said grooves (14) being of a volume much

smaller that that of said recess (9) and being located adjacent to, but not
communicating with, said portion (11) of the form cavity.
An injection-compression process as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that, during said molding stage, said fluid elastomeric material (7) is heated to a

temperature higher than its curing temperature.
An injection-compression process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that, prior to said injection stage, a metal insert (6) is inserted

inside said form cavity (5), and is plastically deformed therein such as to bring
the insert (6) to cooperate in fluidtight manner with respective walls of said

form cavity (5) to define, within it, said portion (11) having the volume and
shape of the item (12) being produced.
