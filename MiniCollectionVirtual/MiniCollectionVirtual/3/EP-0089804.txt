<ABSTRACT>
A focus state detector has light receiving transducers 
(6A, 6B) formed so that the light levels received on the 

respective light receiving surfaces (5A, 5B) differ depending 
on the distance from an object that is to be viewed or 

photographed. 
In conventional focus state detectors for detecting 
whether an optical image of an object is in a correct focusing 

state with the image clearly formed at a predetermined 
image forming surface, if the object to be photographed is 

dark, or if a dark-ground optical system is used, the detector 
output of the or each light receiving transducer element will 

generally be so small that focus state detection is virtually 
impossible, or at best the precision of the focus state 

detection will be relatively low. 
To overcome this problem means project a light onto an 
object (9) through a small aperture (4) to provide a spot 

illumination for focus state detection, and the light receiving 
transducer means (6A, 6B) are so formed that the light levels 

reaching the respective light receiving surfaces (5A, 5B) 
differ depending on distance from the object (9).

   FOCUS    STATE DETECTOR
 This invention relates to focus state detectors having light receiving means so formed that mutually different levels of light reach respective photoelectric transducer light receiving surfaces from an object to be viewed or photographed1 the respective levels depending on distance from the object.


 Generally, in optical observing devices or optical photographic devices for endoscopes, cameras and television cameras, it is a common practice to provide focus state detecting means to determine whether the optical system of the device is in a correctly focussed state, in which an image is clearly formed on a predetermined image forming surface, such as a film surface, for the particular distance from an object that is to be viewed or photographed, so that the object image is clearly defined.


 In some cases an automatic focus setting device may be provided,. which can automatically move the element or elements of the optical system to the correct focus setting
 In knawn focus state detector devices, if the object to be viewed or photographed is dark, or if a dark-ground optical system is used, the detector output of the light receiving element may be so small that focus state detection will be substantially impossible.  


 Therefore it has been proposed to project a beam of a given cross-section toward an object to be photographed, as is described in the Gazette of Japanese
Patent Publication No. 19810/1974. However, this proposal uses an optical system independent of the photographic lens system for the projecting means, and this means that it cannot be applied to an endoscope or the like, in which viewing or photography must utilise the one available light path.


 A split prism may be used, as is described in the Gazette of Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 128923/1981, in which at least two sets, an upper set and lower set, each having at least two minute photoelectric elements, are required, and problems are presented because, if a precision above a fixed level is required, many photoelectric elements will be required, and the circuitry for detecting whether the focus state is correct or not by comparing their output signals will be complicated, and particularly those products which are not required in large numbers sufficient to justify mass production techniques will be costly.


 A focus state detecting device wherein lights are projected onto an object to be photographed by flickering a light source, and the output signals in the extinguished sections deducted from the

   CLAIMS:-   



1. A focus state detector in which an objective lens is provided to form   a.n    image of an object to be viewed or photographed in a predetermined image plane, a light source is provided to project a light spot onto said object via said objective   lensr    a plurality of photoelectric transducers .is arranged at a position nearly optically corresponding to said image plane, and the arrangement of the individual transducers being such that a minimum level of light is incident when said objective lens is in the correct focus state, and such that mutually different levels of light are incident on respective transducers in dependence upon the magnitude and direction of any focussing error, whereby a comparison of the transducer outputs indicates the type of re-adjustment needed for correct focus.
