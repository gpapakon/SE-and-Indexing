<ABSTRACT>
A sludge and oil separator (1) for waste water (effluent) comprises a separator tank (2) in which a fine separation compartment (6) having a plate separation device (18) having a plurality of separation plates (19) arranged one above the other is separated off by an overflow (7) from a coarse separation compartment (3) having a feed (4), an outlet (9) exiting from the fine separation compartment (6) downstream of the plate separation device (18) in the direction of flow. In order to be able to increase the separation effect in an expedient manner and which is easy to maintain, the fine separation compartment (6) is subdivided into two chambers connected together by a flow channel (14), a front oil separation chamber (10) and a rear outlet chamber (11), the flow channel (14) runs downwards and receives the plate separation device (18) and the plate separation device (18) possesses separation plates (19) which run downwards at an angle and end above a base part (16) serving as fine sludge collector.
