<ABSTRACT>
A variable length coder and a variable length decoder. The variable length coder 
comprises a plurality of shifters, each of which inputs a corresponding one of a plurality 

of codewords and a plurality of codelengths, rotates the corresponding codeword by a 
desired length for interconnection of the codewords and outputs masking bits designating 

a position of the corresponding codeword to be rotated, a first OR gate for ORing output 
codewords from the shifters, a second OR gate for ORing output masking bits from the 

shifters, a word/mask register for latching output codeword bits from the first OR gate 
when corresponding output masking bits from the second OR gate are enabled to "1", and 

an FIFO memory for storing an output of the word/mask register and outputting variable 
length-coded data. The variable length decoder comprises a data shifter for shifting input 

data in response to a previous codelength and a matching signal, a decoding circuit for 
discriminating a matched state of output data from the data shifter according to the 

previous codelength to generate a current codelength, the matching signal and a decoded 
word, and a shift controller for controlling a shifting amount of the data shifter in 

response to the current codelength and the matching signal from the decoding circuit and 
outputting the previous codelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to variable
length decoders, and more particularly to
a variable length decoder for performing variable length decoding for the
entropy-coded video data from the variable length coder in real-time.Generally, entropy coding is used for compressing digital video data with no loss.
In such an entropy coding technology, variable length coding is adopted in the case where
a data generation probability is not fixed. Namely, the variable length coding is used to
represent data of the higher generation probability as a shorter code while data of the
lower generation probability as a longer code. A Huffman code is well-known as the
most effective entropy code.In the entropy coding technology, source coding is first performed for the digital
video data to remove a data redundancy present in a signal source. The digital video data
is then entropy-coded by run length coding and the variable length coding.Then, the source-coded and entropy-coded data is decoded by a variable length
decoder.Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a block diagram of a conventional variable
length coder as known from US-A-5 173 695. As shown in this drawing, the conventional variable length coder comprises 
a register 7 for storing temporarily data VLi inputted therein, a code generator 10 for
generating a codeword VCW and a codelength VCL corresponding to output data from
the register 7 and outputting the generated codeword VCW and codelength VCL to
registers 8 and 9, respectively, and barrel shifters 5 and 6 for shifting an output codeword
from the register 8 and an output codeword from a register 4.The register 4 is adapted to store temporarily an output codeword from the barrel
shifter 6 and output the temporarily stored codeword to the barrel shifters 5 and 6.Also, the conventional variable length coder comprises a register 3 for storing
temporarily an output codeword from the barrel shifter 5 and outputting variable length-coded
data VLCo, and a bit operation unit 1 for performing a logical operation for a reset
signal RST and output data from a barrel shifter 2 to output an available data signal
AVLC and apply bit information VL1 to the barrel shifters 2 and 5.The barrel shifter 2 is adapted to accumulate an output codelength from the
register 9.The bit operation unit 1 includes a latch 14, flags 15-18, an OR gate OR1, a NOR
gate NOR1 and an AND gate AN1. The code generator 10 is comprised of an uncoded-word
table 11 of an AND-plane and a codeword table 12 and a codelength table 13 of
OR-plane
