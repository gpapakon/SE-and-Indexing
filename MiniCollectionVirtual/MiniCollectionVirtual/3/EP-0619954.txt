<ABSTRACT>
Crash-helmet for cyclists and sportspeople in general, comprising a 
cap (1) of moulded rigid material and at least a couple of elements 

fastening the chin-strap to the cap, said fasteners being consituted by 
a small frame (11) made up preferably by an isosceles triangle section, 

dihedron-bent at 90°, provided with suitable holding means (9,10), and 
by a strap-holding bar (8), suitable to be fitten in and stably held 

between said holding means (9,10).

<DESCRIPTION>
Object of this invention is a crash-helmet for cyclists 
and sportspeople in general, provided with a chin-strap 
and relevant safety fasteners of the chin-strap to the 
helmet cap. As known, crash-helmets for cyclists and in general for 
those who practice a sport that require remarkable 
efforts and physical stress, besides meeting the safety 
requirements and being suitable for protecting the head 
of the user in case of falls and/or hittings against 
various objects or blunt bodies, must also be very 
light and adequately ventilated on the inside, not to 
become an element of discomfort and hindrance to the 
sports-activity during the efforts made by the user in 
said sports-activity. Usually, said helmets for cyclists, mountain-climbers, 
canoeists and the like are constituted by a very light 
protection cap of expanded material, such as polystyrene, 
polyurethane and the like, obtained for instance by 
moulding, variously shaped and provided with slits or 
slots for the passage and the circulation of air on the 
inside; the chin-strap or straps which serve to hold 
the helmet in position on the head of the user are 
fastened to the cap. The fastening system of the strap is of great importance, 
as it must be such as to ensure that the strap is  
 
not torn off from the cap as a consequence of particularly 
intense strains, leaving the head of the user 
unprotected, taking into account the fact that the 
expanded material of which the cap is usually made has 
good characteristics of shock and squashing resistance, 
but has a very little resistance against tensile stresses, 
especially when these are localized stresses of 
the punctiform or tearing type. To fasten the chin-strap to the cap sides, according to 
a known system the strap is caused to pass from the 
inside of the cap to the outside through a slot provided 
on one of the cap sides and then to pass again from 
the outside to the inside through a second slot parallel 
to the first one and provided on the other side of 
the cap. In this way, the strap forms a loop on the 
outside of the cap and does not run the risk of accidentally 
detaching from the helmet, but there is the 
drawback that the strap is not stably fastened to the 
cap and tends to slide in the slits, stressing their 
edges, which tend to bur with time and wear. The patent application EP 0052068 (KIWI S.A.) describes 
a device for fastening the chin-strap to the cap, 
constituted by bridge or hook-shaped elements or by 
rivets fixed to the internal surface of same cap and so

<CLAIMS>
Crash helmet for cyclists and sportspeople in 
general comprising a protection cap (1) of rigid expanded 

material such as polystyrene, opportunely shaped 
and provided with cavities, channels (2), slots (3) and 

various openings, suitable to ensure an adequate ventilation 
within said cap, as well as slits and slots 

suitable to permit the passage of chin-straps (6), characterized 
in that it further comprises: 


at least a couple of elements for fastening chin-straps, 
arranged on both external sides of said cap, constituted 

by a small frame (11) provided with a couple of holding 
and engagement means (9,10) constituted by cavities or 

recesses provided along the edges of said frame, placed 
in a symmetrically opposite position with respect to 

one another along the edges of said frame (11) and by a 
strap-holding bar (8) suitable to fit in and be stably 

held between said holding and engagement means (9, 10); 
at least a couple of chin-straps (6) provided on one 
end with an eyelet or loop (7) suitable to be engaged 

on said strap-holding bar (8). 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said frame (11) has a square, rectangular or polygonal 

form in general or a circular form, depending on the 
form and conformation of the external surface of said  

 
cap and said cavities or recesses provided along the 

edges of said frame have a circular or semicircular or 
square or rectangular or cylindrical form. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said frame (11) has basically the profile of an 

isosceles triangle, dihedron-bent at 90° along its 
height, said holding and engagement means (9, 10) being 

placed in correspondence of the vertex and the centre 
of the basis of said isosceles triangle respectively, 

so that said strap-holding bar (8), fitted in said 
holding means is placed in correspondence of the edge 

of the dihedron. 
Crash-helmet according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the fastening element comprising said frame (11) 

having the profile of an isosceles triangle is placed 
in a housing or impression (4)provided along a cavity 

on the side external surface of the cap (1) of said 
crash-helmet.
