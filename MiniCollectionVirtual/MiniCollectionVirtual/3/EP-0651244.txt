<ABSTRACT>

compensation in gas analyzer equipment for transient error caused 

by temperature change. According to the method, a radiation 
source (1) is used for transmitting electromagnetic radiation 

through a gas mixture to be analyzed, the intensity of radiation 
transmitted through the gas mixture being analyzed is detected 

by means of a thermal detector (4) comprising a radiation 
detecting sensor element (16) and a reference sensor element (17) 

for generating an output signal proportional to the concentration 
of gas being analyzed, the temperature of said thermal detector 

(4) is measured either directly or indirectly, the measured 
detector temperature values are recorded as a function of time, 

and the output signal of the thermal detector (4) is temperature 
compensated by a correction term dependent on the temperature 

rate of change (DT) of the thermal detector. According to the 
invention, the uncorrected output signal V
meas
 of the thermal 
detector (4) is temperature compensated by adding a correction 

term V
comp
 dependent on the temperature rate of change (DT) of the 
thermal detector to said output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a method according to the preamble of claim 1 for
temperature compensation of gas analyzer equipment for transient error caused by
temperature changes.The invention also concerns an apparatus with temperature compensation of
transient error in gas analyzer equipment caused by temperature changes.The invention further concerns a method and an apparatus for improving the
measurement accuracy of a gas analyzer based on thermal detection of infrared
radiation in particular under changes in the operating temperature of the analyzer.The invention is particularly suited to applications in which the infrared radiation
intensity is determined by a direct or indirect measurement of the temperature
difference produced between the sensor element detecting the impinging radiation
and a reference element. Such a detector has the inherent shortcoming that a
change in the ambient temperature disturbs the internal thermal balance of the
detector, and resultingly, the output signal will contain a transient error which
degrades the accuracy of the gas analyzer during the temperature change. The
thermal detector used in the measurement may advantageously be a thermopile
detector.The method according to the invention is suited for use in gas analyzers designed
to perform either the identification or measurement of concentration, or alternatively,
both the identification and measurement of concentration, of at least one
component of a gas sample. Such a gas analyzer can be used for, e.g., monitoring
the composition of the airway gases of a patient anesthetized for the duration of
an operation, whereby the gases to be determined can include at least carbon
dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as at least one anesthetic agent. The thermopile detector measures the infrared absorption of gas introduced to a
sampling chamber, after which the concentration of the desired gas component is
determined from the measured absorption.Thermopile detectors are used in gas analyzers among other things owing to their
capability of DC measurement which facilitates a cost-effective construction of the
measurement system. The wavelength range of thermopile detectors is suitable for
infrared measurements, since the absorption bands centering about the 10 Âµm
wavelength fall within the spectral sensitivity wavelength range of the detector.
Moreover, thermopile detectors have a high sensitivity and good linearity.A characteristic of the thermopile detector is that with a change of its external
housing temperature
