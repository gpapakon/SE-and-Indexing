<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a colostrum fraction having a low endotoxin, protein and immunoglobulin concentration. According to the invention, the colostrum fraction is prepared by ultrafiltration of colostrum pretreated in a desired manner by using a membrane having a cut off of 100,000. The invention is further concerned with the use of the colostrum fraction as a supplement in cell culture media, and with cell culture media containing it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a colostrum fraction
and its use as a supplement
in cell culture media. The cclostrum fraction
according to the invention has a low endotoxin,
protein and immunoglobulin concentration and it is
prepared by ultrafiltration of pretreated colostrum.In the cultivation of mammal cells in vitro,
the basal medium is traditionally supplemented with
mammal blood serum, which contains several partly
unknown cell growth promoting agents, such as growth
factors, vitamins, trace elements, hormones, binding
proteins and attachment factors. A serum suitable for
most purposes is fetal bovine serum, the price of
which has increased greatly with increasing demand in
recent years. Another reason for the high price is
the limited availability of sufficiently pure serum.
Besides the high price, another problem with serum is
its complex composition and especially the high
protein concentration, which hampers the isolation of
produced substances from the culture medium. There is
also a high risk of contamination when using serum as
a supplement in media. Both technologically and
economically, monoclonal antibody production forms an
important part of animal cell culture technology.
Monoclonal antibodies are produced in large
quantities for a variety of clinical and scientific
purposes. In large-scale production of monoclonal 
antibodies, it is important to use a suitable culture
medium. Antibody production should be continuous and
reproducible; process costs should be as low as
possible; antibodies should be readily purifiable;
and contamination caused by microbes and endotoxins
should be avoided. The same applies to the production
of other biological substances, such as growth
factors, hormones and vaccines, which are produced
for clinical purposes by culturing genetically
engineered animal cells. It is, however, very difficult
to meet these requirements when using fetal
bovine serum as a cell culture supplement.Therefore, attempts have been made to find
alternatives for the use of serum by developing
various basal media and serum substitutes. They
contain completely or partly purified growth
promoting agents produced biosynthetically or
isolated directly from a biological substance. Such
growth promoting agents, e.g. various peptide growth
factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth
factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2), are not only present in
serum but also in bovine colostrum. The synthesis,
isolation and purification of growth factors are
usually difficult to carry out, and literature does
not teach any
