<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for manufacturing a branch pipe 
liner bag (11) which can be integrally joined with a 

main pipe liner bag so that water is prevented from 
penetrating through a joining portion between them. A 

tubular unwoven fabric member (1) having its outer 
surface covered with a highly sealable film (2) is 

prepared, and a portion of the film covering one end 
portion (1a
) of the tubular unwoven fabric member is 
torn off. Then, a plurality of slits (b) are cut into 

the end portion (1a) of the tubular unwoven fabric 
member, from which the film (2) has been removed, in the 

longitudinal direction thereof. The end portion (1a) of 
the tubular unwoven fabric member is folded out, and is 

mounted on a first unwoven fabric sheet (4) for forming 
a flange which has previously been set on a frame (3) 

having the same shape as the inner wall of a main pipe. 
A second unwoven fabric sheet (6) for forming a flange 

is then placed on the folded-out end portion (1a) of the 
tubular unwoven fabric member such that the end portion 

is sandwiched by the first and second unwoven fabric 
sheets (4, 6). A liquid hardenable resin is impregnated 

into the end portion (1a) of the tubular unwoven fabric 
member and the first and second unwoven fabric sheets 

(4, 6). After the liquid hardenable resin impregnated 
in them is hardened, a hardenable resin (10) is also 

impregnated into a remaining portion of the tubular 
unwoven fabric member (1), thus completing the desired 

branch pipe liner bag (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a
branch pipe liner bag, and more particularly to a method of
manufacturing such a branch pipe liner bag for use in repairing an
aged or defective branch pipe.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, and then the closed
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open 
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, pressurized fluid is applied to the
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible
liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the
liner is heated, which is effected by heating the fluid filling
the tubular liner bag by means of hot steam,

A method of manufacturing a branch pipe liner bag
(11) comprising the steps of:


preparing a tubular unwoven fabric member (1) having
its outer surface covered with a highly sealable film

(2);
tearing off a portion of said film covering one end
portion (1a) of said tubular unwoven fabric member;
cutting a plurality of slits (b) into said end
portion (1a) of said tubular unwoven fabric member from

which said film has been removed, said slits extending
in the longitudinal direction of said tubular unwoven

fabric member (1);
folding out said end portion (1a) of said tubular
unwoven fabric member;
mounting said folded-out end portion (1a) on a first
unwoven fabric sheet (4) for forming a flange which has

previously been set on a frame (3) having the same shape
as the inner wall of a main pipe;
placing a second unwoven fabric sheet (6) for
forming a flange on said folded-out end portion (1a) of
