<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an automatic lathe comprising a pair of 
gang tool posts (comb-shaped tool posts) (5, 7) disposed 

on opposite sides with a headstock (1) in between. The 
headstock (1) has a main spindle and is movable in an 

axial direction of the main spindle, and the pair of gang 
tool posts (5, 7) are independently movable in respective 

two directions perpendicular to each other and 
perpendicular to the axial direction. This design can 

shorten the machining time and improve the productivity 
accordingly. To prevent interference of work tools due to 

the attachment structure in machining a small workpiece, 
pitches between work tools on one of the gang tool posts 

(102L; 120L; 130L) may differ from pitches between work 
tools on the other gang tool post (102R; 120R; 130R) in 

such a way that when the free-end position of an arbitrary 
work tool of one of the gang tool posts (102L; 120L; 130L) 

is aligned with that of an arbitrary work tool of the 
other gang tool post (102R; 120R; 130R), free-end 

positions of the other work tools of the former gang tool 
post (102L; 120L; 130L) mutually differ from those of the 

other work tools of the other gang tool post (102R; 120R; 
130R). To ensure simultaneous machining of the front face 

of one workpiece and the back face of another workpiece 
respectively using fro
nt and rear work tools without 
requiring high level of parts and assembly accuracy or an 

expensive positioning mechanism, the front work tools  
 

(281a, 281b, 281c) may be mounted on a rear headstock (5) 
and the rear work tools (283a, 283b, 283c) are mounted on 

one (211) of the pair of gang tool posts (211, 213).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
automatic lathe comprising;
a pair of gang tool posts disposed on opposite sides
with a headstock in between, said headstock having a main
spindle and being movable in an axial direction of said
main spindle.An automatic lathe of this kind is generally known in the art.One example of an automatic lathe is designed as
follows. This automatic lathe has a headstock which is
designed movable in the direction of a Z axis parallel to
the axial direction of a main spindle. A pair of gang
tool posts are disposed in front of the headstock and on 
both sides (e.g., right and left sides) thereof,
respectively. The gang tool posts are designed movable in
the directions of an X axis and Y axis perpendicular to
the Z-axial direction. The controls of the gang tool
posts in the X-axial direction and Y-axial direction are
not performed independently. For example, both gang tool
posts make the same movement in the X-axial direction. In
the Y-axial direction, the gang tool posts can make the
same movement or one gang tool post moves forwardly in the
Y-axial direction (upward) while the other gang tool post
moves reversely in the Y-axial direction (downward)
because both gang tool posts are coupled by a rack and
pinion mechanism.According to the above conventional structure,
however, as a pair of gang tool posts make movements
mutually associated with each other, both gang tool posts
cannot be used simultaneously to machine workpieces, or
their usage is limited so that while one is used to
machine a workpiece, the other cannot be ready for the
next machining (to wait near the workpiece). Therefore,
only one gang tool post is used to sequentially machine
workpieces, requiring a longer machining time. This
inevitably reduces the productivity.A structure for mounting a plurality of work tools on
a pair of gang tool posts will be discussed below. Those
work tools are arranged in alignment at given pitches,
with their free ends aligned in a line. In machining a 
workpiece, there may be a case where the pair of gang tool
posts are moved to cause the free end of one of the work
tools mounted on each gang tool post to contact the outer
surface of the workpiece, and machining, such as turning
or boring, is then carried out with the two work tools
brought at the respective sides of the workpiece.To attach the work tools to each gang tool post, the
work tools are positioned one by one and are then secured
by attaching members. In actual attachment, however, an
attachment error is likely to occur so
