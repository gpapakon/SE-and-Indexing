<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
smoke type fire detector which detects a smoke density 

accurately, even when an internal temperature thereof changes. 
An internal temperature detecting unit (70) detects an 
ambient temperature of a light emitting element and a light 

receiving element. A correction coefficient K having a value 
associated with the ambient temperature detected by the 

temperature detecting unit is used to correct an output level of 
the light receiving element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a smoke type fire detector
according to the preamble of claim 1, as disclosed in GB-A-2 230 853.A smoke type fire detector comprises a light emitting
element and a light receiving element both lying in a smoke
room. Light emanating from the light emitting element is
reflected irregularly due to smoke. The irregularly-reflected
light is received by the light receiving element. A level of an
output signal of the light receiving element is amplified by an
amplifier. A smoke density is then identified using the
amplified level of the output signal.Temperature varies depending on an environment of a
site at which a detector is installed. Ambient temperature of
the detector varies depending on the installation site.
Specifically, the temperature of the detector is very high due
to solar thermal power in the vicinity of a roof of a building,
while the temperature thereof is very low in an underground room
made of a non-adiabatic concrete. Between these cases,
temperature conditions differ greatly. The ambient temperature
of the detector is greatly affected by the climate defined with
the latitude of an installation site or the presence or absence
of an air conditioner.The sensitivity of a detector is adjusted under
substantially the same temperature conditions at a factory.
Assuming that the sensitivity of a detector varies depending on
a temperature, even if the sensitivity is adjusted during a 
manufacturing process of adjustment at a factory, the
sensitivity may vary depending on an installation site.For example, a light emitting diode (LED) is employed
as a light emitting element and a photodiode is employed as a
light receiving element. The LED has such a temperature
characteristic that the quantity of light emanating therefrom
varies at - 0.6 % /°C. The photodiode has such a temperature
characteristic that the output level thereof varies at + 0.2
% /°C. The overall temperature characteristic of the LED and
photodiode comes therefore to - 0.6 % /°C + 0.2 % /°C = - 0.4
% /°C. Even when an actual smoke density remains unchanged, if
an internal temperature of a smoke type fire detector changes,
the output level of the light receiving element varies at - 0.4
% /°C. Specifically, when the internal temperature of the smoke
type fire detector changes by 50°C, the output level of the
light receiving element varies by 20 %.Aside from the light emitting element and light
receiving element, an amplifier composed of semiconductor
elements has a temperature characteristic. As the
