<ABSTRACT>
The echo canceller digital filter is first set to zero. 
Then a test signal is sent through the down link to the 

echo canceller and the filter taps are adjusted until 
the echo signal in the up link to the echo canceller is 

less than a predetermined stored reference level. The 
test signal is then removed and the number of filter 

taps having signal samples nearing zero and/or the 
number of filter taps having significant signal samples 

is determined and thereafter the taps having non-significant 
signal samples are eliminated for making the 

echo canceller ready for operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the elimination of the 
echo signals in telecommunication links, more particularly 
in satellite telecommunication links. When an impulse is received at the input of a terminal 
station from a far-end terminal station an impulse echo 
is produced in the return path towards the far-end terminal 
station. The echo signals are currently eliminated 
by connecting an echo canceller at the terminal stations 
of the telecommunication system. In particular, digital echo cancellers are used to provide 
an echo estimate of the incoming signal, which 
echo estimate is subtracted from the echo signal produced 
in the return path. A digital echo canceller 
essentially comprises a digital filter including a 
number of delay cells. Such a filter is controlled by 
adjusting the coefficients of each cell in such a way 
as to obtain the suitable impulse response which is a 
fairly exact replica of the echo signal. An echo impulse appearing in an up link shows a response 
curve that depends on the delay created by the 
user terminal circuits. These circuits include a 4-wire 
circuit directly connected to the up and down links and 
a 2-wire circuit connected to the user side. Each of  
 
said circuits generates a respective delay and produces 
in the return path echo samples which extend over a 
relatively long period of time. The total delay introduced by these circuits, and 
consequently the number of samples, currently varies 
from one telephone link to the other. Therefore the 
echo cancellers used so far in the satellite communication 
systems are controlled to cover the major part 
of the echo samples produced both by the 4-wire and 2-wire 
circuits. By way of consequence, the filters used 
in these known digital echo cancellers must comprise a 
great number of delay cells, the control of which requires 
a great number of filter taps to be adjusted and 
high computer power and time for performing the required 
control. It is the object of the invention to reduce the number 
of filter taps to be adjusted in a digital echo canceller 
and thereby to reduce the total time required for 
controlling the echo canceller and the computer power 
required for operating a digital echo canceller. Accordingly, this invention provides a method for an 
adaptive and fast control of an echo canceller digital 
filter. Briefly, use is made of a test signal which is launched 
through an incoming or down link to a terminal station 
and the digital filter is adjusted using the impulse 
response from the
