<ABSTRACT>
A crystalline titanium-containing molecular sieve having a framework 
structure isomorphous with zeolite beta and containing Si and Ti, but essentially 

no framework Al, usefully catalyzes the epoxidation of olefin with organic 
hydroperoxides. The catalyst may be prepared by forming a mixture of a 

hydrolyzable silicon compound, a hydrolyzable titanium compound, and a benzyl- 
substituted ammonium species wherein each nitrogen atom bears a single benzyl 

substituent and subjecting said mixture to hydrothermal treatment at a 
temperature of from 100 to 200°C for a time effective to form the crystalline 

titanium-containing molecular sieve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of selectively oxidizing olefins so as to
obtain products containing epoxide functional groups. In particular, the invention
pertains to processes whereby an active oxygen species such as an organic
hydroperoxide or a hydrogen peroxide source is reacted with an ethylenically
unsaturated substrate in the presence of a relatively large pore crystalline
titanium-containing molecular sieve catalyst to yield an epoxide. The catalyst is
characterized by a framework structure isomorphous to zeolite beta comprised of
silica and titanium, but essentially free of framework aluminum.Many different methods for the preparation of epoxides have been developed.
One such method involves the epoxidation of an olefin in a liquid phase reaction using
an organic hydroperoxide as the oxidizing agent and certain solubilized transition
metal compounds as catalyst. Although this approach is practised commercially and
generally provides high selectivity to epoxide, it has at least two characteristics which
tend to limit process flexibility and increase 
production costs. The use of an organic hydroperoxide results in the generation of
a co-product alcohol derived from the reacted hydroperoxide during epoxidation;
approximately 1 equivalent of the co-product is obtained for each equivalent of
epoxide. If no market exists for the alcohol, the co-product must be further reacted
(incurring additional processing costs) so as to convert it back to the hydroperoxide
oxidant or to another compound for which a commercial demand exists. Recovery
of the soluble metallic catalyst used in such a process for reuse in subsequent runs
is also problematic. It would therefore be highly desirable to develop an insoluble
(heterogeneous) epoxidation catalyst which has high activity and selectivity when
utilized with an oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide which does not form an organic
co-product. Such a catalyst would ideally be readily recoverable in active form from
an epoxidation reaction mixture by filtration or similar separation techniques or be
capable of being utilized in the form of a fixed bed or the like.Workers at the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia have recently reported the
synthesis of a titanium silicoaluminate isomorphous to zeolite beta (see Camblor et
al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. pp. 589-590 (1992), Camblor et al., Zeolites
13, pp. 82-87 (1993) and ES 2037596 (published 6/16/93)). Such aluminum-containing
materials were found to catalyze the oxidation of alkanes to alcohols,
ketones, and
