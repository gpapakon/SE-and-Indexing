<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the single-chain thrombomodulin ("TM") and analogs thereof that are not susceptible to cleavage by proteases and retain the biological activity of thrombomodulin, as well as methods of use in, for example, antithrombotic therapy. Novel proteins, nucleic acid gene sequences, pharmaceuticals and methods of inhibiting thrombotic activity are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.
Serial No. 07/830,577, which is a continuation-in-part of
U.S. Serial No. 07/568,456, filed August 15, 1990, which
is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/506,325,
filed April 9, 1990, and the application corresponding to
PCT Serial No. 90/00955, filed February 16, 1990, which
was a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Serial No.
07/406,941, filed September 13, 1989, which was a
continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/345,372, filed
April 28, 1989, all of whose disclosures are entirely
incorporated by reference herein.The present invention relates to single-chain
thrombomodulin polypeptides, including analogs of
thrombomodulin ("TM") that are less susceptible to
cleavage by proteases. These analogs are useful in, for
example, antithrombotic therapy. Novel proteins, nucleic
acid gene sequences, pharmaceuticals, and methods of
inhibiting thrombotic activity are disclosed.There are many disease states that would benefit
from treatment with a safe and effective
anticoagulant/anti-thrombotic. The nature of these
conditions varies. For example, anticoagulant therapy is
useful in acute conditions such as during thrombolytic
therapy in myocardial infarction or in treatment of
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated
with, for example, septicemia. Anticoagulants are also
useful for less acute conditions, such as chronic use in 
patients that have received heart valve implants or
prophylactic use in surgery patients to reduce the risk
of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).Thrombomodulin is a membrane protein that has
demonstrated anticoagulant properties. Its physiological
importance has been studied. (See, for example, N. Esmon,
et al., (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257:859-864, H. Salem, et
al., (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 259:12246-12251).The gene encoding native thrombomodulin has been
isolated and sequenced from several species, both in its
genomic form and as a cDNA clone (Jackman, R., et al.,
(1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 83:8834-8838 and
(1987) 84:6425-6429, both of which are herein
incorporated by reference). Comparisons with known
proteins, such as the LDL receptor, have suggested
functional domains (Wen, D., et al., (1987) Biochemistry
26:4350-4357). One study has suggested that the fifth
and sixth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains have
the capacity to bind thrombin (Kurosawa, S., et al.,
(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:5993-5996); another suggests
that EGF-like domains 4, 5, and 6 are sufficient to act
as a cofactor for
