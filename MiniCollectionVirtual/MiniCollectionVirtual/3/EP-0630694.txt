<ABSTRACT>
The interior of a pipeline is cleaned using a 
polymeric gel pig of a hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl 

cellulose reacted by a redox reaction with vinyl phosphonic 
acid. The gel pig is formed by hydrating the polymer in an 

aqueous liquid, and is crosslinked by the addition of a 
Lewis base or Bronsted-Lowry base. Contaminants entrained 

in the crosslinked gel pig during the cleaning process may 
be separated by the addition of a pH reducing agent to the 

pig, whereby the viscosity of the gel is caused to decrease. 
The gel may be used for further cleaning after contaminant 

separation by addition of an additional quantity of the 
Lewis base or Bronsted-Lowry base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a method of 
cleaning a pipeline containing particulate matter or other 
solids debris utilizing gel pig. Numerous methods exist to effect cleaning of the 
interior of a pipeline of scale and other debris. 
Mechanical pigs and gelled chemical pigs have been used to 
remove the scale and other debris. The mechanical pigs are 
normally solid somewhat bullet shaped devices with rubber 
baffles, wire brushes or abrasive surfaces to physically 
scrape the scale and debris from the pipe. The gelled 
chemical pigs, on the other hand, generally remove the 
debris by entrainment as the gelled fluid passes through the 
pipeline. Various processes utilizing chemical pigs for 
pipeline cleaning are disclosed in, for example, U.S. 
Patents 3,523,826; 4,216,026; 4,252,465; 4,389,461; 
4,416,703 and 4,543,131 and the numerous patents identified 
therein. The various processes utilize chemical pigs formed 
from various gelled fluids or emulsions to pick up and carry 
debris in the pipeline from a point of injection to a point 
of ultimate recovery. The recovered chemical pigs 
containing the debris then are broken to separate the debris 
and permit disposal of the chemical pig. The chemical pigs 
generally are incapable of reuse after removal from the 
pipeline. In many instances, due to the limited ability of 
the chemical pigs to continuously support large quantities  
 
of debris as it is collected within a pipeline, large 
quantities of the chemical pigs must be utilized to ensure 
that the debris is picked up and maintained at a 
concentration that can be satisfactorily removed by the 
chemical pig. Alternatively, a quantity of a debris laden 
chemical pig is passed through a pipeline to a 
predetermined location whereupon it is removed and replaced 
with a new chemical pig to remove additional debris. It would be highly desirable to provide a gelled 
fluid pig that could be utilized to remove solid debris from 
a pipeline, the debris be removed from the fluid and the 
fluid be utilized to remove additional debris. Such a fluid would possibly permit smaller fluid 
volumes to be utilized, multiple uses of the fluid and 
decreased disposal costs since less overall fluid ultimately 
must be disposed of upon completion of the cleaning 
process. We have now found a gelled fluid which can be 
crosslinked, uncrosslinked and recrosslinked upon successive 
changes in the pH of the fluid, permitting the formation of 
a gelled fluid pig for pipeline cleaning from which 
accumulated debris can

A method of cleaning the interior of a pipeline, 
which method comprises passing a crosslinked cellulose ether 

derivative gel pig through said pipeline, wherein said pig 
is prepared by admixing a cellulose ether derivative 

comprising a product of reaction of a hydroxyethyl or 
hydroxypropyl cellulose having a molar substitution of from 

1.5 to 3, with a vinyl phosphonic acid in the presence of a 
redox system at a temperature of from 20 to 60Â°C, with an 

aqueous fluid containing at least a trace amount of at least 
one divalent cation to form a base gel; admixing a 

crosslinking activator comprising a Lewis base or Bronsted-Lowry 
base with said base gel to initiate crosslinking of 

said base gel; and wherein said base gel containing the 
crosslinking activator is introduced into said pipeline in

base is admixed with said base gel to raise the pH of the 

base gel. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, which further 
includes the steps of removing the crosslinked gel from said 

pipeline; reducing the viscosity of the gel by reducing the 
pH of said gel, removing at least a portion of said 

contaminants from said gel; and adding an additional 
quantity of said crosslinking activator to said gel in an
