<ABSTRACT>
A recording disk apparatus comprises a 
clearance between a shaft (26, 77, 105, 201, 304) and a 

thrust bearing portion (15, 28, 118, 119) tapered in a 
circumferential direction, a lubricant communication 

groove (43-45, 123, 203) of a bearing (17, 72, 107, 
202, 302) covered by the shaft so that a lubricant on 

a radial bearing portion (12, 25, 117a, 117b, 209) 
communicates with the lubricant on the thrust bearing 

portion through the lubricant communication groove, a 
lubricant circulating path (123, 208) which extends 

axially from the thrust bearing portion to the radial 
bearing portion to prevent the lubricant flowing out of 

the thrust bearing portion from returning directly to 
the thrust bearing portion without passing the radial 

bearing portion, and/or a clearance between a slide 
bearing (26, 77, 105, 201, 304, 17, 72, 107, 202, 302) 

and a magnetic fluid seal device (11, 24, 80, 125,
