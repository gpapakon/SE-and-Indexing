<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for machining and material processing includes an excimer laser and a Fresnel zone plate array (FZP) positioned parallel to the workpiece, with the distance between the FZP and the workpiece being the focal length of the FZP. For each hole to be formed on the workpiece a corresponding Fresnel zone is patterned onto the FZP. Each Fresnel zone may be patterned directly centered over the desired hole location or in high density patterns it may be located off-center from the hole with deflection being accomplished by the formation of finer circular arcs on the side of the Fresnel zone opposite the desired direction of deflection. A beam scanner is included to provide a more uniform illumination of the FZP by the laser beam. The scanning eliminates non-uniformity of intensity. The alignment mechanism uses a helium-neon laser, the beam from which is projected onto a surface relief grating on the workpiece. The reflected light from the surface relief grating is filtered to create interference fringes which, when aligned, provide maximum light intensity projected through a transmission grating on the Fresnel zone plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Very small holes of arbitrary contours are important for
many applications, including fabricating vias in printed
circuit boards and integrated circuit packages
(see for example DE-A-4 106 423).
Traditional
mechanical means of forming vias, such as drills or punches,
are capable of forming vias as small as 0.004 inch (.10 mm).
Below this limit, lithographic or optical techniques must be
used.One of the optical techniques for micro-machining is
direct ablation with a laser focused onto the workpiece with
a microscope. Vias are drilled one-at-a-time with the stage
on which the workpiece sits scanning to the next via to be
formed, repeating the procedure until all of the vias are
formed. This technique may include the use of a patterned
metal mask over the surface of the substrate so that the laser
ablates material only through the openings in the metal.
After ablation the metal can be patterned or removed as the
design requires. The processing quality of this method is
limited in that it takes a relatively long time to complete a
single workpiece.Lithographic techniques include determining the pattern
of vias with photoresist then subjecting the workpiece to
reactive ion etch. The photoresist is subsequently removed
leaving the vias patterned in the workpiece. The reactive ion
etch involves the use of a very expensive piece of equipment,
and several additional process steps are required for
patterning, etch and photoresist strip. It is known that laser machining can be done using
modulated zone plates, holographic optical elements and binary
phase gratings. These diffractive optics are more efficient
than mask-based techniques, theoretically being capable of
directing 100% of the incident light into a desired image.
However, these diffractive optics techniques are limited in
that many of them are only capable of generating a periodic
matrix of spots, and they often require a refractive lens for
focusing which may reduce efficiency and introduce aberrations
and distortion.It would be desirable to provide an apparatus and method
for machining and material processing which provides the
efficiency of diffractive optics techniques and a laser while
permitting the formation of an arbitrary pattern which may be
created for specific applications. It is such an apparatus
and method to which the present invention is directed.It is an advantage of the present invention
as defined in the claims
to provide a
system which uses diffractive optics techniques to form an
arbitrary pattern for machining and material
