<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymers with 
altered surface energies. In particular, the present 
invention relates to those polymers having a decreased 
surface energy. Polymeric materials are usually considered to 
have relatively low surface energies. However, it is often 
desirable to reduce the surface energy of these materials 
even further for special purposes. Thus, for example, injection molded or blow 
molded polymeric articles often stick to the molds and 
release agents are required for coating the articles or 
molds. Also, coatings are used for polymeric release 
liners to provide for the easy release of labels or decals. 
Further, lubricants are applied to reduce the friction 
between two polymeric surfaces. Silicone fluids have been used as mold releases 
and/or internal lubricants for molded thermoplastic 
articles for approximately 20 years. One of the drawbacks 
of the current practice is that, after transfer of the 
fluid from the surface of the mold to the molded surface or 
vice versa, the silicone fluid is fugitive. This can cause 
undesirable transfer to other surfaces during manufacturing 
and handling, or present problems for subsequent operations 
such as painting or plating. Reactive silicone fluids are coated onto extruded  
 
laminates to provide adhesive-release surfaces. The major 
drawbacks with this practice are cost of the coatings and 
the need for a secondary coating operation. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a composition of matter which has utility in 
reducing the surface energy of polymers. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a polymer which has a decreased surface energy. It is also an object of the invention to provide 
a release liner prepared from a polymer for use as a 
protective cover for tapes, adhesive films, labels, decals, 
etc. It is a further object of the present invention 
to provide a polymer having a non-fugitive mold release for 
use in forming injection molded or blow molded articles. In addition, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a film extrusion processing aid, 
lubricant or anti-blocking agent. It is also an object of the present invention to 
provide a material with a reduced coefficient of friction 
for molded or extruded articles. Consideration of the specification, including the 
Examples to follow, will enable one skilled in the art to 
determine additional objects and advantages of the 
invention. The present invention comprises a method for 
forming a polymer with a
