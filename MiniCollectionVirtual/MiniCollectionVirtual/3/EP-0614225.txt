<ABSTRACT>
It is known to bring the surface into the inverted state in CCD imaging 
devices with buried channels during the integration period in order to keep the dark 

current low (All Gates Pinning). The desired potential profile, with wells in which the 
charge is integrated bounded by potential barriers, is obtained through the use of a two-phase 

structure with a doping profile in the channel or with a gate oxide having 
thickness differences. Owing to limiting conditions which hold for the clock voltages 

used for charge transport, serious limitations are imposed on the depth of the potential 
wells and thus also on the charge storage capacity of the pixels. This disadvantage is 

counteracted by the operation of the device not as a two-phase but, for example, as a 
four-phase CCD according to the invention, whereby a d.c. shift is present between the 

clock voltages for compensating the built-in, comparatively great potential differences 
described above. An imaging device is obtained thereby with a low dark current, a great 

charge storage capacity per pixel, and a high transport efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a charge coupled device of the buried channel 
type with a semiconductor body comprising a first layer of a first conductivity type 
which adjoins a surface of the body and which forms a buried channel for storage and 
transport of electric charge, a second layer of the second conductivity type opposite to 
the first which lies below and adjoins the first layer and forms a barrier layer, and a 
third layer of the first conductivity type which lies below and adjoins the second layer 
and through which excess charge can be drained from the first layer, the surface being 
provided with a system of electrodes with a series of gates which are situated above the 
buried channel and which are connected to a voltage source for the at least temporary 
application of such a voltage to the gates that an inversion layer of the second 
conductivity type adjoining the surface is formed below the gates, while means are 
present for obtaining a built-in potential difference in the channel whereby potential 
wells in which charge can be stored alternating with potential barriers are formed in the 
channel upon the application of equal voltages to the gates. The invention also relates to 
a charge coupled image sensor comprising such a charge coupled device. Such a device is known inter alia from US Patent 5,115,458. This 
describes an image sensor of the n-channel type comprising channels in the form of n-type 
surface zones provided in a p-type region (well) which is formed at the surface of 
an n-type substrate and which separates the channels from the substrate. It is known that 
in such a configuration any excess charge in the channels, consisting of electrons, can 
be drained off through the substrate. A major advantage of this vertical charge drain 
which can be mentioned is that it prevents the "blooming" effect which occurs upon 
overexposure. In addition, it is possible to set the charge state to zero at the beginning 
of an integration period (charge reset) in that all charge present in the image sensing 
elements is removed through the substrate, whereby it is possible, for example, to 
adjust the exposure time. The surface is provided with a system of electrodes 
comprising gate electrodes or gates which are insulated from the surface by a thin gate  
 
dielectric. Voltages are applied to the gates, at least during the integration period, such 
that inversion of the conductivity type occurs at the surface. This operating mode, also 
called "all gates pinning mode" (AGP), renders it
