<ABSTRACT>
The invention described here is a method whereby a molecular tag is put on a gene, transcript and protein in a single recombinational event. The protein tag takes the form of a unique peptide that can be recognized by an antibody or other specific reagent, the transcript tag takes the form of the sequence of nucleotides encoding the peptide that can be recognized by a specific polynucleotide probe, and the gene tag takes the form of a larger sequence of nucleotides that includes the peptide-encoding sequence and other associated nucleotide sequences. The central feature of the invention in its essential form is that the tag-creating DNA has a structure such that when it is inserted into an intron within a gene it creates two hybrid introns separated by a new exon encoding the protein tag. A major utility of the method is that it allows one to identify new proteins or protein-containing structures, and, having done so, to readily identify and analyze the genes encoding those proteins.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fields of Molecular Biology and Molecular Genetics with specific
reference to the identification and isolation of proteins and of the genes and transcripts that encode
them.The primary area of the invention - the identification and tagging of genes and proteins - has
received a great deal of attention, and many successful methods have been devised. None of these
methods, however, has the feature of tagging gene, transcript and protein in a single event.Linkage Analysis. Genes have traditionally been identified by identifying mutations and then
mapping them with respect to one another by means of genetic crosses. This kind of mapping, or
linkage analysis, does not serve to isolate the genes themselves nor does it indicate anything about
the genes' molecular structure or function. In recent years a form of linkage analysis using
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) has come into use (1). This method serves to
identify DNA sequences that are linked to a gene of interest, and, having identified such a DNA
sequence, it is possible in principle, and sometimes in practice, to identify and clone the gene itself 
by performing chromosome walks or jumps (2). It should be stressed that, even when successful,
this strategy identifies the gene, not the protein encoded by the gene.Transposon Tagging. Another technique for cloning genes that has been developed relatively
recently goes by the name transposon tagging. In this technique (3), mutations due to the insertion
of transposable elements into new sites in the genome are identified, and the genes in which the
transposons lie can then cloned using transposon DNA as a molecular probe. Transposon tagging,
like RFLP/linkage analysis, identifies genes, not proteins.Enhancer trapping. Another method for identifying genes, enhancer trapping (4), involves the
random insertion into a eucaryotic genome of a promoter-less foreign gene (the reporter) whose
expression can be detected at the cellular level. Expression of the reporter gene indicates that it has
been fused to an active transcription unit or that it has inserted into the genome in proximity to cis-acting
elements that promote transcription. This approach has been important in identifying genes
that are expressed in a cell type-specific or developmental stage-specific manner. Enhancer
trapping, like like RFLP/linkage analysis and transposon tagging, identifies genes, not proteins,
and it does not directly reveal anything about the nature of the protein product of a

<CLAIMS>
A method for tagging genes, transcripts and proteins comprising the steps of:

(1) producing a DNA molecule containing within it an acceptor site for RNA splicing
and associated nucleotide sequences necessary for splice acceptor function, followed

by a tag sequence of nucleotides encoding one or more specifically defined and
known peptides followed by a donor site for RNA splicing;

product of said gene contains as part of its primary sequence a new sequence or

sequences of amino acids encoded by said tag sequence of nucleotides.
