<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a receiving and issuing device for round parking cards (2) having an identification and/or communication component for the fee-paying actuation of a car park barrier (39) which operates securely and reliably and is of simple construction. To this end the receiving and issuing device has a storage container (1) having at the base an individualising device (3) for the parking cards (2), a contiguous drop chute (4) with at least one central guide chute (11) and side chutes (12, 13) branching off at an angle therefrom for the issue and reception of parking cards (2) rolling under the effect of gravity and a measuring point (24) in the central guide chute (11) for reading the parking cards (2) issued and/or received which is connected to a control device for actuating the car park barrier (39).

Feeding-in and issuing device for round parking 
tickets (2) having an identification and/or communication 

element, for the fee-paying operation of a parking 
barrier (39), which device has a supply container (1) 

that has at its base a separating device (3) for the 
parking tickets (2), a chute (4) connected thereto and 

having at least one central leading chute (11) and side 
chutes (12, 13), branching off therefrom and each being 

at an incline, for the rolling issuing and feeding-in of 
parking tickets (2) under the influence of gravity, and a 

measuring point (24) in the central leading chute (11) 
for reading the parking tickets (2) to be issued and/or 

returned, which measuring point is connected to a control 

for the operation of the parking barrier (39). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the dimensions of the leading 

chute (11), of which there is at least one, optionally 
being connected to an intake region (16), and of the side 

chutes (12, 13) are such that tipping over of the parking 
tickets (2) out of an upright position in which they are 

able to roll during their movement through the chute (4) 
is avoided. 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the side chutes (12, 13) are 

arranged in relation to the leading chute (11), of which 
there is at least one, in such a manner that the parking 

tickets (2) run in by way of their circumferential 
surfaces.  

 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any one 
of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the leading 

chute (11) leads into a collecting container (21) for 
used parking tickets (2) that are to be re-introduced 

into the supply container (1). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any 
one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a feed-in 

chute (13) branches off from the leading chute (11) above 
an issuing chute (12), and the measuring point (24) is 

arranged between the regions at which the chutes (12, 13) 
open into the leading chute (11). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any 
one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a switch 

element (20) that selectively blocks the leading chute 
(11) is provided at the entry to an issuing chute (12). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any one 
of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the bottom 

running surface (19) of the issuing chute (12) is in the 
form of a rocker (29) that varies the incline of the 

issuing chute (12) and is suitable for blocking the 
leading chute (11). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the rocker comprises two running 

surfaces (19, 33) that are angled towards one another, 
the running surface (33) at the issuing side being in the 

form of a stop surface for a removal position of a 
parking ticket (2) to be issued. 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any one 
of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the chute (4) has 

a stop device (25) that blocks passage through in order 
to detain the parking tickets for a time in the region of  

 
the measuring point (24). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any 
one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that there are 

associated with the measuring point (24) a plurality of 
signal receiver devices (36, 37) distributed in the 

chute (4) for interaction with signal sources incorporated 
on or in the parking tickets. 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any one 
of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the central 

leading chute (11), of which there is at least one, is a 
substantially vertically aligned chute. 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to any one 
of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the separating 

device (3) comprises a chute-shaped narrowed portion (5) 
at the base of the supply container (1) for the piling up 

of parking tickets (2), the width of which narrowed 
portion only slightly exceeds the diameter of the parking 

tickets (2) and which is arranged above a separating 
channel (6), connected to the leading chute (11), for 

lateral engagement of the parking tickets (2) by a 
stripper element (7). 
Feeding-in and issuing device according to claim 11, 
characterised in that the stripper element (7) comprises 

a slide element (10) that travels beneath the narrowed 
portion (5), which slide element has a recess for 

receiving one parking ticket (2) at a time.
