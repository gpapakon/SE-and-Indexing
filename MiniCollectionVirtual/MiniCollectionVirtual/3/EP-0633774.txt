<ABSTRACT>
Topical preparations containing as active ingredient toremifene or one of its metabolites N-demethyltoremifene or 4-hydroxy-toremifene or their pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salts are useful for the treatment of cancers localized in the skin or on a short distance from the skin such as metastatic lesions of breast cancer. They may also be used in adjuvant therapy of breast cancer and in the reversal of multidrug resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs. Such topical preparations are of particular interest in the treatment of melanoma, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and fungoides mycosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to topical preparations containing as
active ingredient toremifene or one of its metabolites N-demethyltoremifene
(4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-[4-[2(N-methylamino)ethoxy]phenyl]-1-butene)
or 4-hydroxytoremifene (4-chloro-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-1-[4-(2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethoxy]phenyl]-1-butene)
or their pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic
salts. Such topical preparations may be used e.g. for the treatment of cancers
localized in the skin or on a short distance from the skin such as metastatic lesions
of breast cancer. Moreover, these topical preparations may be used for the
adjuvant therapy of breast cancer as well as for the reversal of multidrug resistance
of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs. Topical administration of toremifene or its
metabolites are of particular interest in the treatment of melanoma, lymphoma,
Kaposi's sarcoma and fungoides mycosis.Tamoxifen and toremifene are triphenylethylene antiestrogens used
in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.
These drugs are the most frequently prescribed as endocrine agent
for the treatment of breast cancer. Tamoxifen and toremifene
inhibit estrogen-induced growth by competitive antagonism of
tumor estrogen receptors (ER's). Antiestrogen therapy is
effective in prolonging a disease-free state and overall survival
of women following primary surgery. Antiestrogen therapy delays
recurrence and prolongs survival in patients with primary breast
cancer undergoing adjuvant therapy after mastectomy. About two-thirds
of patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive
metastatic breast cancer will have a temporary remission on
tamoxifen. Although tamoxifen is considered a relatively benign
drug, recent evidence suggests that women receiving tamoxifen as
adjuvant therapy may have increased risk of developing
endometrial neoplasms (Fornander T et al, Lancet 1989, 21:117-120).
Histopathology identifies these tumors as infiltrating
endometrial tumors unrelated to breast tumor metastasis. The
factors contributing to this increased risk are not well 
understood. However, a variety of studies have linked endometrial
cancer to agents with estrogen activity (Smith Dc et al, N
England J Med 1975; 293: 1164-67).The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major
mechanisms by which cancer becomes refractory to chemotherapeutic
agents, especially anthracyclines and the vinca alkaloids.
Classical MDR is associated with the overexpression of a mdr-1
gene that codes for a plasma membrane P-glycoprotein (p170). The
