A hermetically sealable fresh-keeping container for 
organic substances, in particular foodstuffs, with a 

dimensionally stable bottom part (1) that incorporates a support 
surface for the goods tha
t are to be kept fresh, a similarly 
dimensionally stable upper part (2) that is laid on the bottom 

part (2) so as to be removable, thereby forming a useable space 
above the support surface, and an air pump system (19) for the 

air within the useable space, characterized in that in the 
area that is delimited by the upper part (2), the useable 

space is delimited by an airproof foil (9), the edge of 
which is hermetically and releasably connected to a wall 

that delimits the remainder of the useable space; and in 
that a suction opening (10) for the air pump system (19) is 

incorporated in this wall. 
A container as defined in claim 1, characterized in 
that the upper part is configured as a hood (2). 
A container as defined in claim 2, characterized in 
that the foil (9), when deployed, is of a shape and size 

that at least approximates that of the hood (2). 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the foil (9) incorporates a sealing 

strip (8) along its edge, and when the container is closed 
this sealing strip is clamped between an encircling contact 

surface (5) of the lower part (1) and an encircling edge 
surface of the upper part (2).  

 
A container as defined in claim 4, characterized in 
that the edge surface of the upper part (2) is provided with 

an encircling groove that is open towards the support 
surface (5) of the bottom part (1), the sealing strip (8) 

fitting in this. 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the upper part (2) is connected by at 

least one hinge (6) to the bottom part (1). 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the upper part (2) can be held in a 

hermetically sealed position on the bottom part (1) by at 
least one closing device. 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the support surface (5) is formed by a 

plate that is connected hermetically in the space above the 
bottom of the bottom part (1) to the side wall thereof and 

is preferably formed in one piece. 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized by a first connector channel (28) that opens 

out at one end into the inside surface of the side wall of 
the upper part (2) and at the other into the edge area of 

the upper part (2), and a second connector channel (30), one 
end of which is adjacent when the container is closed to the 

end of the first connector channel (28) that opens out in  
 

the edge area and the other end of which is connected to the 
air pump system. 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the bottom part (1) has in the space 

beneath the support surface (5) a base plate (3) that is 
connected to the side walls; and in that the air pump system 

is accommodated in the intervening space between the support 
surface (5) and the base plate (3). 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the outlet opening of an air suction 

channel (10) of the air pump system is located in the 
support surface (5); and in that between the air suction 

channel (10) and the pump (18) of the air pump system there 
is a particle separator (11, 13). 
A container as defined in claim 11, characterized in 
that the particle separator, which is formed in the manner 

of a siphon, incorporates a pipe (13) that extends downwards 
from the support surface (5) into which a pipe that forms 

the suction channel (10) and which is of smaller diameter 
extends; in that the lower end of the pipe (13) that is of 

greater diameter is located in a removable collector (14); 
and in that above the lower end of the pipe (11) that forms 

the air suction channel (10) this pipe incorporates a branch 
(13') for a suction line (15) that leads to the pump (18). 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the air pump system incorporates a  

 
preferably monostable two-way valve (16), that in one switch 

position keeps the first suction line (15) that leads from 
the pump (18) to the suction channel (10) open and the 

second suction line (26) that leads from the pump (18) to 
the second connector channel (30) closed. 
A container as defined in one of the claims 1 to 13, 
characterized by a control device (34) for the electric 

motor (19) that drives the pump (18), and a solenoid (23) 
that actuates the two-way valve (16). 
A container as defined in claim 14, characterized in 
that a switch (32) of a pressure sensor (31) is connected to 

the control device (34) and this switches off the pump (18) 
when the partial vacuum within the useable space has reached 

the prescribed value. 
A container as defined in claim 15, characterized by 
warning lights (36, 37) that are controlled by the switch 

(32) of the pressure sensor (31). 
A container as defined in claim 15 or 16, characterized 
in that a second switch (33) is connected to the control 

device (34), the position of this depending on whether the 
container has been closed properly or improperly.
