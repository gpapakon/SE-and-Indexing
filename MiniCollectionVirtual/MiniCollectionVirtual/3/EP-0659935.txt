<ABSTRACT>
In a process for providing security papers with authenticity features, a homogeneous mixture of a feature material which is present in powder form and a gas in a defined concentration is produced. This mixture is ejected at high velocity from at least one nozzle arranged at a predetermined distance from the paper web and is transferred to the running paper web.

<CLAIMS>
A method for equipping papers of value with authenticity features wherein at
least one feature substance (9) is applied to a moving, wet paper web (3) in the

course of papermaking, characterized in that a homogeneous mixture is produced
from a feature substance (9) present in powder form and a gas in a defined

concentration, and the mixture hits the running paper web in a directed
particle stream from at least one nozzle (7) disposed at a given distance from

the paper web (3) at high speed which suffices to anchor the particles firmly in
the paper stuff.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the distance between the
nozzle (7) and the paper web (3) is selected to be at least so large that the running

paper web does not touch the nozzle, but is at most so large that the feature
substance hits the running paper web in a directed particle stream at a sufficiently

high speed.
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that the distance is between
0.5 and 5 cm using a feature substance (9) with particles having a mean diameter

of 0.1 to 20 microns and an outlet rate of the gas/feature mixture from
the nozzle (7) between 100 and 300 m/s.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the gas used is nitrogen,
argon or air.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the feature substance (9)
is present in the gas when emerging from the nozzle in a concentration of

10 mg/m
3
 to 10 g/m
3
, preferably 2 to 10 g/m
3
.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the feature substance (9)
is applied with the aid of a plurality of nozzles (7).
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that the nozzles (7) are disposed
so that the feature substance is applied in the form of a coding.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the mixture is produced
with the aid of a fluid bed generator (4). 
A method according to claim 8, characterized in that at least part of the fluid
bed generator (4) is set vibrating by suitable measures.
An apparatus for applying at least one feature substance for detecting authenticity
to a moving, wet paper web having at least one nozzle (7) executed in

such a way that a mixture of feature particles (9) and a gas emerges under pressure
in a directed particle stream, and having means (4) for producing the pressure,

characterized in that the

means (4) are suitable for producing a homogeneous mixture from feature particles

(9) and a gas with a defined concentration of the feature substance (9) in
the gas, and
the at least one nozzle (7) is executed in such a way that the mixture emerges
with a relatively sharply limited scattering cone, and
the apparatus contains feeding means (8) for feeding the mixture to the nozzles.
An apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that the means for producing
the mixture are a fluid bed generator (4) containing the feature substance

(9) and coarse material (19) for crushing the feature substance (9).
An apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that the coarse material
(19) in the fluid bed generator (4) consists of a material that is already added

during production of the paper web (3).
An apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that the coarse material
(19) consists of the same material as the feature substance (9).
An apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that the means for producing
the mixture can be operated under pressure.
An apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that the apparatus also has
means for generating vibrations.
An apparatus according to claim 15, characterized in that the means for generating
vibrations are a vibrator or an interval rapper.
An apparatus according to claim 15, characterized in that the apparatus contains
a plurality of vibration-generating means which can be operated at different

frequencies. 
An apparatus according to claim 15, characterized in that the apparatus furthermore
contains means for locally limiting the effect of the vibrations.
An apparatus according to claim 18, characterized in that the means for limiting
the effect of the vibrations are an elastic separator.
A paper of value having at least one feature substance (9) incorporated in locally
defined fashion and identifiable visually and/or by machine in contrast to

its surroundings, characterized in that the paper of value is produced from a
paper web (3) equipped with the feature substance (9) by the method according

to claim 1.
A paper of value according to claim 20, characterized in that the at least one
feature substance (9) is a colorant, fluorescent substance, magnetic and/or

electrically conductive material.
A paper of value according to claim 20, characterized in that the feature substance
(9) is incorporated in the paper web (3) in such a way as to form characters

or patterns, in particular codings.
