<ABSTRACT>
Fruit-flavored, powdered gelatin dessert mixes are 
formulated to obtain a relatively high pH of at least 

4.15, and a relatively low gelatin load weight while 
still retaining a desirable sour taste. The mix 

contains adipic acid and fumaric and/or citric acid at a 
weight ratio of 15-21:1. The mix also contains soluble 

sodium buffer salts and soluble citrate buffer salts at 
a weight ratio of 0.9-2:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
Gelatin is widely known in the food industry for 
use in making gelled desserts. Powdered gelatin dessert 
mixes are used for the preparation of dessert gels in 
both home and food service settings. Refrigerated or 
shelf-stable ready-to-eat gelatin desserts are also 
available. The basic ingredients of gelatin dessert mixes are 
gelatin (either Type A or Type B or a blend of both), 
sweetening agent, which can be a natural sugar, such as 
sucrose, fructose or dextrose, or an intensive 
sweetener, such as saccharin, aspartame or acesulfame-K, 
acid, flavors and colors. Most of these mixes also use 
buffer salts to help in controlling the pH of the gel, 
as well as modifying the setting and melting 
characteristics of the gel. These salts are typically 
citrates, tartrates and/or phosphates. Sometimes a 
small amount of sodium chloride is added for flavor 
enhancement. Gelatin of various Bloom strengths may be 
used, typically from 175 to about 275 Bloom range, with 
the amount of gelatin ranging between 4 and 15% by  
 
weight in the case of sugar-sweetened mixes. The higher 
the Bloom strength, the less gelatin will be required to 
produce the desired product. As might be expected 
higher Bloom gelatins are more expensive than lower 
Bloom gelatins. A manufacturer of gelatin dessert mixes or ready-to-eat 
gelatin gels would desire to use the minimum 
level of gelatin and a low Bloom strength in order to 
lower raw material costs. However, typically a 
manufacturer targets for the mix to attain a certain 
level of gel strength which then, for a given pH, fixes 
the "gelatin load weights" required. "Gelatin load 
weight" is a parameter which account for the increased 
gel strength obtained with a given weight of gelatin as 
the Bloom strength increases. It is also known that the gel strength of gelatin 
rapidly decreases as the solution pH is reduced below 
about 4.0. Conversely the higher the pH of a solution, 
the less gelatin is needed to obtain a gelled product 
having a desired gel strength. Gelatin dessert mixes, 
for example Jell-OÂ® Brand gelatin dessert mix, are 
typically fruit-flavored and thus have been formulated 
to produce a tart or sour taste by buffering the 
solution to a pH of around or below 4.0. It would 
therefore be desirable from an economic standpoint if 
the solution pH of the gelatin gel could be raised in 
order to reduce the required gelatin load weight. In 
commercial practice, however, this has not previously 
been feasible since the higher pH also decreases the 
sour taste
