<ABSTRACT>
In a system for distributing videos, a plurality of videos are 
stored on a mass storage device. Each video includes a 

plurality of frames of digitized video data for play-back on 
a viewing device. The system includes a memory buffer for 

storing a segment of a selected one of the videos. The 
segment includes a predetermined number of frames representing 

a predetermined time interval of the selected video. In 
addition, the memory buffer includes a write pointer and a 

read pointer. Software controlled servers are provided for 
writing and reading video data of the selected video to and 

from the memory buffer, independently, at locations indicated 
by the write and read pointers to transfer the selected video 

to the viewing device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention applies to the general area of information
distribution, and more particularly to information distributed
as video signals.There is a need to provide consumers with video services
on-demand. Desirable video on-demand services can include, for
example, movies, sporting events, interactive games, home
shopping, textual information, and educational and arts
programs, hereinafter collectively referred to as "videos". It
should be understood that videos generally includes both video
and audio portions, although, a video may only have an image
portion as in textual information, or only an audio portion ,
as for example music. Consumers would like videos of their choice to be available at
times and locations convenient for them. It would be an
advantage if the videos could be delivered by any transmission
medium, such as commercial telephone, cable, and satellite
networks. The videos should be compatible with readily
available display systems, such as NTSC standard televisions,
or personal computers.Furthermore, consumers would like to have real-time,
interactive VCR-like control of the videos, skipping, holding,
or replaying portions at will. Home shopping and video games
require a much higher level of interaction between the video
and the game-player. In addition, the system used to provide
video on-demand services should be scaleable at a reasonable
cost to maximize the availability of the service to large
populations of consumers.A major problem with known distribution systems for video
services, such as broadcast or cable television is that the
consumer has no control over program or time selection. Also,
known video distribution systems are limited by predetermined
channel allocations in the number of different videos that are
available at any one time. And, most known video services are
generally not interactive.Some video services allow for on-demand delivery of videos 
over specialized high-speed fiber optic cable networks.
Generally such services deliver the video to the customer as
one continuous uninterruptable stream. Therefore, such
services generally require expensive mass storage devices and
special play-back equipment at the consumer's location to
provide interaction. Alternative such services require
duplicate system resources at the distribution site for each
of the customers, even if multiple customers are viewing the
same video. Consequently, known video on-demand systems which
deliver videos to consumers are not easily expandable to large
scale distribution.The document

A system for distributing a selected one of a
plurality of videos, the selected video including a plurality

of frames, each frame including digitally encoded video data,
the video data representing time sequenced image signals and

audio signals for play-back on a viewing device, comprising;

means for storing the selected video;
a memory buffer, coupled to said means for storing, for
storing a segment of the selected video, said segment

including video data of a forward moving time interval of the
selected video,
a write pointer, coupled to said memory buffer,
associated with a first data stream including video data to be

written to said memory buffer;
a read pointer, coupled to said memory buffer, associated
with a second data stream including video data to be read from

said memory buffer;
means, coupled to said write pointer, for writing said
first data stream to said memory buffer while distributing the

selected video; and
means, coupled to said read pointer, for reading said
second data stream from said memory buffer while distributing

the selected video, said means for reading operating
independently from said means for writing, to transfer any

video data of said segment of the selected video to the 
viewing device, while writing said first data stream.
The system as in claim 1 including a plurality of
read pointers, each read pointer being associated with a

different second data stream including video data of said
segment to be read from said memory buffer, and said means for

reading to read each different second data streams from said
memory buffer while distributing said selected video, each

different second data streams transferring a different
portions of said segment of the selected video to a

corresponding different viewing devices.
The system as in claim 1 wherein said memory buffer is
a circular buffer, said writing means to advance said write

pointer to the beginning of said circular buffer upon reaching
the end of said circular buffer, said reading means to advance

said at least one read pointer to the beginning of said
circular buffer upon reaching the end of said circular buffer,

and said writing means to overwrite a particular frame after
said particular frame has been read.
The system as in claim 1 wherein said writing means to
write the video data of the selected video to said memory

buffer at a different rate from reading the video data while
distributing the selected video, further including means for

reading the video data in reverse chronological order 
beginning at said at least one read pointer, while moving said

at least one read pointer in a reverse direction.
A method for distributing a selected one of a
plurality of videos, the selected video including a plurality

of frames, each frame including digitally encoded video data,
the video data representing time sequenced image signals and

audio signals for play-back on a viewing device, comprising
the steps of:


storing the selected video on a storage device;
storing a segment of the selected video in a memory
buffer, said segme
nt including a forward moving time interval
of the selected video, said memory buffer including a write

pointer and at least one read pointer;
writing a first data stream including video data of the
selected video to said memory buffer at said write pointer

while advancing said write pointer while distributing the
selected video; and
reading a second data stream including video data from
said memory buffer at said at least one read pointer while

advancing said at least one read pointer, said reading
operating independently from said writing to transfer any

video data of said segment of the selected video to the 
viewing device.
The method as in claim 5 wherein said memory buffer
includes a plurality of read pointers, each of said plurality

of read pointers associated with one of a plurality of viewing
devices, and concurrently reading the video data at each of

said plurality of read pointers while advancing each of said
plurality of read pointers to concurrently transfer different

portions of the selected video to each of said plurality of
viewing devices associated with each of said plurality of read

pointers, further including the step of switching the
association of any of said plurality read pointers with any of

said plurality of viewing devices, further including the step
of positioning said at least one read pointer to any of the

frames stored in said memory buffer, further including the
steps of selecting a particular frame of the selected video,

and writing the video data to said memory buffer beginning
with said particular frame. 
The method as in claim 6 further including the step of
switching the association of any of said plurality read pointers

with any of said plurality of viewing devices.
The method as in claim 5 further including the step of
positioning said at least one read pointer to any of the frames
