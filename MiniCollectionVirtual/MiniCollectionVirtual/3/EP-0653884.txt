<ABSTRACT>
The interactive video on demand network is intended 
for a plurality of user stations (US11, ..., USNM) and 

includes a video server (VS) producing a plurality of delayed 
instances of a video signal for transmission to the user 

stations, and a buffer means (IB1, ..., IBN) to an input of 
which a selected one of these instances is applied and at an 

output of which a version of the video signal as requested by 
a said user station is provided. The buffer means generates 

the requested version under control of control signals issued 
by the user stations and selects the instance based on that 

requested version. The buffer means (IB1, ... IBN) is able to 
transmit a load request signal to the video server (VS) which 

in response thereat applies at least part of the video signal 
to the input of the buffer means for storage therein, at a 

rate substantially higher than real time. In this way the 
buffer means always contains at least that part of the video 

signal needed to provide to the user station the version it 
has requested for and to provide functions such as pause, 

(fast) forward, (fast) rewind and resume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an interactive video 
on demand network with a plurality of user stations and 
including a video server producing a plurality of delayed 
instances of a video signal for transmission to said user 
stations, and a buffer means to an input of which a selected 
one of said instances is applied and at an output of which a 
version of said video signal as requested by a said user 
station is provided, said buffer means under control of 
control signals issued by said user station generating said 
requested version and selecting said instance based on said 
requested version. An interactive network of the above type is 
already known from the article "System architecture for a 
large scale video on demand service", by W. Sincoskie, Computer 
Networks and ISDN Systems 22, 1991, pp. 155-162. In the 
latter article the instances are referred to as phases and 
the buffer means as a stop/start buffer. The article describes how a low cost interactive 
video service, more particularly a so called quasi-video on 
demand service can be provided which allows the user stations 
to view a video signal by using one of the mutually delayed 
video signal instances produced by the video server. As a 
consequence these user stations can neither start viewing at 
a moment of their choice since they have to wait until a 
delayed instance is produced, nor can they enjoy functions 
such as PAUSE, FAST FORWARD, REWIND, etc because the video 
signal instances are transmitted in a continouous way. To provide an interactive service buffer means can 
be included in the network as mentioned in the article, 
thereby allowing a user station to view the user requested 
version of the video signal which needs neither be concurrent 
nor identical to any of the instances provided for the quasivideo 
on demand service. In particular, the user station may 
pause and resume viewing the video signal at any moment and  
 
may, to a limited extent, even visually rewind or fast 
forward within the video signal thanks to the fact that the 
video signal instances produced by the video server for 
transmission are buffered in the buffer means. However, when using this known network as an 
interactive network, it appears to have a number of serious 
deficiencies which apparently up to now and to a large extent 
remained unnoticed. As described in more detail hereafter 
these deficiencies are accountable to the fact that the 
requested version of the video signal may only be generated 
by the buffer means by using the
