<ABSTRACT>
An electronic compensation circuit (24; Fig.4) in which a simulation of a laser's 
thermal droop characteristics is used to adjust input to the laser and thereby compensate for 

the laser's thermal droop effects The simulation circuit is connected to the laser either as an 
open loop circuit to provide a once only correction or as a closed loop feedback circuit to 

provide a continuous correction of the laser droop effects. Video data signal (20) on line (22) is 
connected to switch S that switches between laser control signal (36) on line (38) or AGC signal 

(30) on line (32) and ground (42). Thermal effects correction signal (26) is connected to the 
laser control signal (36) through an RC circuit (44,46) whose time constant is equal to the 

falling time constant t
fs
 (Fig.1). As capacitor (46) charges, a small signal proportional to laser 
control signal (36) appears on line (28). This is the termal effects correction signal and satisfies 

I=Ae
(-t/RC)
, where A is an arbitrary constant. The simulation circuit is designed using either 
analog or digital circuitry and is adjustable to provide compensation for lasers having different 

time constants of droop or different values of droop.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to laser diodes and more particularly concerns an
electronic simulation in which thermal effects are modeled and used for correcting laser diode
output.A single beam laser diode assembly has a single diode and usually, in a scanning
system, the diode is driven by a train of image pixel information. The pixel information is used
to drive the diode and therefore stimulate laser flux emission where there is a white pixel in a
write white system. In a write white system, a laser is turned on to create white space on a
page. Intensity of the light beam is directly proportional to the output power of the laser. In
order to keep the output power of the diode constant, the temperature of the diode should be
kept at a constant level. However, due to the structure of the laser diode assembly, as the
pixels change, the temperature of the diode fluctuates, which in turn causes the output power
of the diode and the intensity of the light beam to fluctuate.A multiple beam diode assembly has at least two diodes in close proximity on a
common substrate. Each diode is driven by a separate train of image pixel information. Again,
as the pixels change, the temperature of each diode fluctuates. However, in a multiple diode
system, the changing temperature of a diode also causes a temperature fluctuation in adjacent
diodes. The temperature fluctuations of the adjacent diodes cause the output power and the
intensity of the light beams in those adjacent diodes also to fluctuate.A tri-level system may use one or more diodes with at least one diode operating at
full on, full off, and partially on. One example of an application using a single diode tri-level
system is the printing of black and white documents with a highlight color. Tri-level systems
suffer from the same heating effects both in the full on and the partially on modes of the laser.In a printing system fluctuation in the intensity of light beams causes fluctuation in
the size of a printed pixel. As the intensity of the light beam decreases, so does the pixel size.In Figure 1, the intensity variation in a diode over time is shown due to heating and
cooling effects. To illustrate the effect, a first laser beam 10 is left turned on while a second
laser beam 12 from an adjacent laser is cycled from a full on position to a full off position using
a step function. While the second laser beam 12 is on, heating effects on the first beam 10 cause
the intensity to drift downward and finally stabilize at a lower value. The change in intensity
