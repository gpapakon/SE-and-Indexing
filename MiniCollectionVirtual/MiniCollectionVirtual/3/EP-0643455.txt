<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for wiring an electrical connector with 
two or more rows of subsequent contacts, in particular a 

connector (1) of the IDC type, comprises a movable holder (5) for the 
connector, at least one tool (6,7) for applying a wire in a contact (2) 

of the connector aligned with the tool, said tool being 
movable back and forth transverse to said holder, and means 

for moving the holder in steps in such a manner that a contact 
of the connector is aligned with the tool after each step. The 

apparatus further comprises a first guiding element (8) having a 
base face (10) with at least one guiding slot (11) for guiding the 

projecting contact pin parts (3) of a row of contacts of a 
connector to be wired and located in said holder (5), said guiding 

slot (11) extending in the direction of movement of the holder 
above the holder, a front guiding face (12) for guiding a wire to 

be connected, said guiding face extending transverse to the 
holder along at least the width of the holder between two 

subsequent contacts of a row of contacts one of these two 
contacts being aligned with the tool and having its contact 

pin portion extending into the corresponding guiding slot, and 
a side guiding face joining the front guiding face for guiding 

the wire to be connected, said side guiding face substantially 
extending in the direction of movement of the holder and 

extending from the base face with the guiding slot(s) 
obliquely upwardly and away from the holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for wiring an 
electrical connector with two or more rows of subsequent 
contacts, in particular a connector of the (Insulation Displacement Contact) IDC type, 
comprising a movable holder for the connector, at least one 
tool for applying a wire in a contact of the connector aligned 
with the tool, said tool being movable back and forth transverse 
to said holder, and means for moving the holder in steps 
in such a manner that a contact of the connector is aligned 
with the tool after each step. Such an apparatus is known in different embodiments, 
see for example EP-A-0 105 045 and US-A-3 742 571. The known 
apparatus is only suitable for wiring a standard connector of 
the IDC type. In other types of connectors it is known to make 
the connector as a so-called stackable connector, wherein the 
contacts of the connector each are provided with a projecting 
contact pin part so that a second connector can be plugged 
onto the first connector. Up to the present it is not possible 
to make a connector of the IDC type as a stackable connector 
and to wire the same with the known apparatus. The invention aims to provide an apparatus of the 
above-mentioned type which is adapted in a simple matter for 
wiring a connector of the IDC type made as a stackable 
connector. To this end the apparatus of the above-mentioned type 
is characterized by a first guiding element having a base face 
with at least one guiding slot for guiding the projecting 
contact pin parts of a row of contacts of a connector to be 
wired and located in said holder, said guiding slot extending 
in the direction of movement of the holder above the holder, a 
front guiding face for guiding a wire to be connected, said 
guiding face extending transverse to the holder along at least 
the width of the holder between two subsequent contacts of a 
row of contacts one of these two contacts being aligned with 
the tool and having its contact pin portion extending into the 
corresponding guiding slot, and a side guiding face joining 
the front guiding face for guiding the wire to be connected, 
said side guiding face substantially extending in the  
 
direction of movement of the holder and extending from the 
base face with the guiding slot(s) obliquely upwardly and away 
from the holder. In this manner it is obtained, that the known 
apparatus is suitable for wiring the stackable connector of 
the IDC type by adding a guiding element. The guiding slots 
support the contact pin parts during applying the
