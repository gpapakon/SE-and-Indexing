<ABSTRACT>
A holding device (1) for elongate articles, in particular fluorescent tubes (10), comprises a covering with a holding region (5) which is adaptable relative to the cross-section of the article to be held, which article has an elastic element (12) thus causing a frictionally engaged connection between the covering and the article. The covering is formed by a folding box which can be of single-part or multiple-part construction and can be provided with openings or holding tabs for suspension in an article display.

<CLAIMS>
Holding device for goods having a fluorescent tube 
mounted therein, consisting of a coating (1) with 

at least one holding area, wherein the coating (1) 
fits over the cross-section of the fluorescent 

tube (10), and an elastic element (12) which 
causes a frictionally engaged connection between 

the coating and the fluorescent tube, 
characterised in that a rubber band (12) is 

provided as the elastic element. 
Holding device for goods as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the coating is a collapsible 

cardboard box (1) that is open at at least one 
end. 
Holding device for goods as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the coating is formed in two 

pieces as a collapsible cardboard box (1), wherein 
two holding areas with a respective elastic 

element (12) are provided. 
Holding device for goods as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

coating (1) is made of cardboard material. 
Holding device for goods as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

coating is formed as a collapsible cardboard box 
and that transparent openings (3) or a bracket (4)  

 
with a punching (5) allowing the hanging in onto a 

shackle of a goods display are provided at at 
least one end of the collapsible cardboard box 

(1). 
Holding device for goods as claimed in claim 5, 
characterised in that the bracket (4) extends onto 

the lateral faces (7) of the collapsible cardboard 
box (1). 
Use of a coating (1) having at least one holding 
area, wherein the coating (1) fits over the cross-section 

of a longitudinal object (10), and a 
rubber band (12) which causes a frictionally 

engaged connection between the coating and said 
object (10), as a holding device for this 

longitudinal object. 
Use as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that 
the longitudinal object is a fluorescent tube. 
Use as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that 
the fluorescent tube has a coating (10) with a
