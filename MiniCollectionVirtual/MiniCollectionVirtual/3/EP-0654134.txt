<ABSTRACT>
A surgical-type glove and illuminator assembly (10) particularly adapted for use by health care professionals when examining or operating upon an anatomical part (16) of a patient. A spotlighting illuminator (26) is securely mounted on the fingers portion (20) of the glove (18) toward the work surface when the glove (18) is in use. The illuminator (26) may have a self-contained light source (36), or utilize fiber optic-transmitted light from a light source remote from the glove (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to protective gloves of the type
worn by health care professionals when examining or operating
upon patients, and more particularly, to an assembly of a
surgical-type glove incorporating an illuminator for projecting
light toward the work surface being examined or operated upon.While the following discussion describes the present
invention specifically in the context of its most prevalent use in
the health care field, it will be understood that the invention is
not intended to be so limited and has broader applicability to
other fields where surgical-type gloves are normally employed.
This would include, for example, its use by workers assembling
small electronics parts where a contamination-free environment
is essential.When examining or operating upon an anatomical part of
a patient, physicians, dentists and veterinarians will usually
have available to them several different forms of lighting for
illuminating their field of examination or operation. These
include natural light entering the room through windows,
overhead general room lighting, and directable high intensity
lamps in fairly close proximity to the patient. Oftentimes,
circumstances will require that these various sources of
illumination be supplemented by a spotlighting type of
illumination more specifically focused toward the particular body
part being examined or operated upon.One approach for providing such spotlighting has been to
incorporate illumination devices in combination with various 
medical and dental instruments. This type of approach is
described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,823,244,
issued April 18, 1989 and U.S. Patent No. 5,003,434,
issued March 26, 1991. In the devices described in these
patents, light is transmitted through the bore of the
instrument itself or its handle, and projected toward the
body part under examination or operation through the
distal tip of the instrument or distal ports in the
handle. The light source may be, for example, a battery-powered
lamp either housed entirely within the bore of
the instrument or handle or detachably connected thereto.
Alternatively, an optical fiber cable may be used for
transmitting light to the bore of the instrument from a
light source remote from the instrument.The devices described in the above patents have
certain inherent limitations. The relatively small size
of the light output ports and their close proximity to
the work surface, limit the work surface area that can be
effectively illuminated by the projected light beam and
permit

<CLAIMS>
A surgical glove and illumination assembly (10)
comprising:


a surgical type glove (18) having a distal
fingers portion (20), an intermediate

metacarpal portion (22) and a proximal wrist
portion (24), said glove being adapted to be

worn over the hand of a user when examining or
operating upon a work surface; and
an illumination means (26); said assembly being
characterised in that said illumination means

(26) is securely mounted on said fingers
portion (20) of said glove (18) and oriented to

project light beam (32) distally of said glove
(18) toward said work surface when said glove

(18) is in use.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the angle of
projection of said light beam is controllable by

finger movement of the wearer.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein said
illumination means (26) is mounted on said glove so

as to overlie the middle phalanx of at least one of
the fingers of the wearer. 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein said
illumination means (26) is mounted on said glove so

as to overlie the forefinger of the wearer.
The assembly of claim 4, wherein said
illumination means (26) is mounted on said glove so

as to overlie the middle phalanx of said forefinger.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein said
illumination means (26) comprises a light housing

terminating in a distally facing light output lens
(30).
The assembly of claim 6, wherein said
illumination means (26) is secured to the topside of

said glove by an encasement means (34) covering said
housing without obstructing said lens (30).
The assembly of claim 7, wherein said
encasement means (34) is formed integrally with said

glove.
The assembly of claim 6, wherein said
illumination means includes a self-contained

battery-powered light source (36,38) carried within
said housing, and switch means (40) carried on the

exterior of said housing (28) for operating said
light source. 
The assembly of claim 9, wherein said housing
