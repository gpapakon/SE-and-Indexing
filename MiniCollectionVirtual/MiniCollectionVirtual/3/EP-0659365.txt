<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for preparing, in a metered manner, and dispensing a cosmetic product, particularly a product for colouring (tinting) and bleaching hair, which is obtained by mixing two liquid, creamy or gel-form constituents just before use. It comprises a transparent cylindrical body (1) with a flexible wall, equipped at its two ends (2,3) with identical external screw threads (4,5) and two removable end caps (8,9) equipped with identical internal screw threads (12,13) each capable of interacting with any one of the external screw threads of the body, the wall of the said body being equipped with at least one series of graduations, over the length of the body, one of the caps (8) including a dispensing means (14), the other cap (9) including an orifice (17) equipped with a non-metallic valve (18) with automatic closure.

Device for preparing, in a metered manner, a
cosmetic product and dispensing this product,

particularly a product for dyeing and bleaching hair,
which is obtained by mixing, just prior to use, two

constituents which are liquid, creamy or in gel form,
comprising a body with a transparent wall equipped with

at least one series of graduations, characterized in
that the said body (1) is cylindrical with a flexible

wall open at its two ends (2, 3), and in that the
device comprises, at the said ends, identical external

screw threads (4, 5) and two removable end caps (8, 9)
equipped with identical internal screw threads (12, 13)

which are each formed on a cylindrical skirt (10, 11)
of a respective cap, each of the said internal screw

threads being capable of interacting with either of the
external screw threads of the body, the said

graduations are preferably of two series of graduations

formed head-to-tail (6, 7) over the length of the body,
one of the caps (8) including a means (14) for

dispensing the cosmetic product prepared in the device,
the other cap (9) including an orifice (17) equipped

with a non-metallic valve (18) with automatic closure
through which one of the constituents of the cosmetic

product may be introduced into the body of the device
after the other constituent has previously been

introduced into the said body via the opposite end (2)
before the said cap (8) equipped with the dispensing

means (14) has been replaced on the said opposite end. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the valve with automatic closure comprises a

membrane (18) in the form of a dome which is convex
towards the inside of the body (1) of the device when

the cap including the said valve is screwed onto the
latter, the said membrane including at least one slot

(19) provided in the vicinity of the top of the dome
and delimited by edges which are capable of coming into

contact with each other in order to produce a leaktight
closure at rest and capable of separating to allow the

passage of a product fed under pressure from the
concave outer-wall side of the dome-shaped membrane.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the membrane (18) in the shape of a dome is

fastened onto the corresponding cap (9) by means of
bearing means (20) providing a positive closure of the

slot (19) of the membrane.
Device according to either of Claims 2 or 3,
characterized in that it includes a connecting

end-piece (21) including a dome-shaped protuberance
(22) arranged so as to be applied, with correspondence

of shapes, against the concave outer surface of the
dome-shaped membrane (18).
