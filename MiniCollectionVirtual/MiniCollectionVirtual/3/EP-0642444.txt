<ABSTRACT>
A bin comprises a collapsible wall over a pallet. The collapsible wall comprises a pair of side walls and a pair of end walls interconnected by vertical hinges with the end walls having additional intermediate vertical hinges whereby the end walls are collapsible to fold between the side walls to form a flat collapsed pack. A plurality of collapsed packs stack vertically side-by-side over a vertical stack of nested pallets. The pallets have nestable legs which inter-relate with indentations of a lid for the bin. The pallet and lid can have charge and discharge openings with closures thereto. The bin parts are in expanded foam for light weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: "COLLAPSIBLE CRATE"FIELD OF THE INVENTIONTHIS INVENTION relates to a collapsible bin or crate, and, in particular, to the style of collapsible bin or crate wherein, in the process of collapsing, side panels fold along a vertical axis.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVarious forms of collapsible bins or crates have been devised. Most usually, the collapsing involves panels that are folded together along hinges established along a combination of vertical or horizontal edges. In some prior designs, the bin or crate is collapsed by folding of various panels along hinge lines that bisect the panels. In these latter arrangements, the hinge line can be located in either of a vertical or a horizontal direction. Prior Australian Patent Specification Nos. 68129/87 and 46290/85 set out descriptions of collapsible crates in which side panels fold along horizontal hinge lines. In prior Australian Patent Specification No. 44120/85, the crate collapses by folding along vertically aligned hinge lines that bisect opposed side panels.Whilst a wide range of collapsible bins or crates have been devised in the past, none have proved to be totally satisfactory. In the transport of fruit and vegetables, bulk bins or crates have been employed for the more solid fruits and vegetables, but of what is in standard use, few of these is collapsible to realise the advantage of the collapsible concept providing for return and reuse.Some fruits and vegetables, being soft, etc., cannot be packed into crates of any great depth. One single size of crate has limited utility. What construction techniques have been used to date do not lend themselves to creation of a range of depths in 

crate volumes which crates can be stacked conveniently to take advantage of available height on transports, in stores, etc.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a collapsible bin or crate capable of cost effective use in the transport of bulk quantities of fruit, vegetables, grains and other like commodities.Other objects, and various advantages, will hereinafter become apparent.NATURE OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention achieves its object in the provision of: side walls for containing goods therebetween, said side walls being collapsible on vertical hinge lines into a flat pack; and a pallet to support the side walls thereover providing a floor thereto to contain produce therein; characterised in that: a plurality of the said pallets are stackable one above the other; and a respective plurality of collapsed side

CLAIMS
1. A collapsible bin or crate for transport of goods therein comprising: side walls for containing goods therebetween, said side walls being collapsible on vertical hinge lines into a flat pack; and a pallet to support the side walls thereover providing a floor thereto to contain produce therein; characterised in that: a plurality of the said pallets are stackable one above the other; and a respective plurality of collapsed side walls are so dimensioned that in a side by side assembly of a predetermined number of vertically stood flat side walls, said side-by-side assembly nests in a stable configuration on the uppermost pallet of the pallet stack.
2. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said pallet comprises: a platform; hollow base supports beneath the platform to hold the platform in an elevated position above a ground; the base supports being open above the platform; the platform and base supports being configured for stacking with the base supports of an upper pallet nested within the base supports of a lower pallet. 3. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: said pallet is formed with a peripheral upstanding flange thereabout to mate with the bottoms of said side walls, projections on the bottoms of said side walls being projected into slots in said flange. 


4. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: said pallet is formed with a hole therein in an upper surface thereof open into the bin or crate, said hole dimensioned to discharge produce, said hole having a removable lid fitted thereto to contain produce.
5. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the bin or crate is provided with a lid thereover, the lid having recesses therein in which the complementary shaped base of a pallet of another container is locked therein for stable stacking.
6. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the side walls are provided with hinge parts along vertical edges, respective hinge parts of adjoining panels being interdigitated with a hinge pin passed therethrough, the hinge pin passing through a bore in a central hub joined to a cage thereabout via spokes.
7. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the side walls are a structural foam with strengthening ribs thereto.
8. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the side walls have outward projected lugs at their base which lugs locks into slots in a perimeter flange of the pallet when the side walls are open and mounted on the pallet to form the crate, the pallet having a platform forming the base of the crate with supports thereunder to hold the platform elevated over a ground beneath, the supports being hollow and open at the top of the pallet to permit pallets to be nested in 


a stack .
9. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the pallet has a platform forming the base of the crate wherein exists a hole dimensioned to discharge produce, said hole being fitted with a removable closure whereby produce is retained in said crate, the crate being provided thereover with a complementary lid with recesses therein in which another crate thereover nests.
10. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the side walls are panels interconnected by interdigitated hinge parts with a hinge pin therethrough, the hinge parts including a surrounding protecting ring supporting a hub therein through which the hinge pin passes, the panels and hinge parts being integrally formed by a moulding process.
11. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the pallets are moulded with integral upper crate base and open topped, downwardly projected supports dimensioned for nested stacking of crates, the crate base having a removable cover to a discharge hole therein.
12. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the pallet is formed with an upstanding flange to abut the bottoms of the walls and a lid thereover has a downwards projected flange to overlap the upper edges of the walls.
13. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: there is a lid thereover with an upper complementary configuration for receipt thereon of 


another crate in a locked configuration, the lid being moulded in a structural foam.
14. A collapsible bin or crate as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: there is a lid thereover, the walls, pallet and lid being moulded in a structural foam with walls and pallet having inner surfaces to the crate that are flat with outer flanges and/or ribs thereto.
