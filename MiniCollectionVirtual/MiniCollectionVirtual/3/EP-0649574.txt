<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a housing for a price-marking device comprising a LCD (30) and a printed circuit board (20) with control electronics and power supply, e.g. a solar cell. The thin LCD (30) is connected to the underlying printed circuit board (30) by means of a connection device containing conductive rubber areas. Such a device is referred to as a zebra contact, the zebra contact strip (15) being arranged between the LCD (30) and the printed circuit board by means of outer enclosing edges (12a, 12b) on the extruded housing (10) preferably made of plastic material and being compressed in a direction across the conducting rubber areas by the action of outer enclosing edges (12a, 12b) which upon extrudation have been given an inward directed biasing force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to connection by means of a so 
called "zebra strip" or zebra contact, and more exactly by means 
of an extruded plastic housing to achieve the pressure necessary 
to connect a display in form of a LCD (Liquid Crystal Device) to 
a printed circuit board (PCB) by means of a zebra contact. For displaying of e.g. price information and other additional 
information of a merchandise in a shop, normally a price-marking 
label positioned at the forward edge of the shelf carrying the 
merchandise is utilized. According to the state of the art today 
there is a wish to replace these price labels by electronic units 
being controlled by a suitable central computer. By this method 
a great part of the tedious labor for price marking will be 
avoided at the same time as a guarantee is obtained that the 
marking of the edge of the shelf will be displaying the price 
known by the computer and which then controls the registration 
device at the exit cash register. A demand for such an electronic 
device for the marking of shelves is that it among other things 
should be thin not to occupy unnecessary space and should present 
a corresponding function as of the previous price-marking label, 
being most often a thin piece of paper. To accomplish connection between a printed circuit board and a 
display in the form of a LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) for such 
a display for the edge of a shelf one way is to utilize conductive 
rubber. Such a conductive rubber device is normally referred 
to as a so called "zebra strip" or zebra contact, why this 
notation from now on will be used for this type of connecting 
device. To obtain a proper connection it is required that the 
conductive rubber should be compressed by about 15%. This 
compression is necessary to decrease the contact resistance. For 
this traditionally metal housings having wings which are bent  
 
upon assembly have been utilized or screwed joint reinforcements 
between the printed circuit board and the plastic or metal 
housings have been used. All these methods are space consuming and are not suitable for 
thin products. To connect thin products a method was developed 
where a LCD and circuit board were joined by means of a flexible 
printed board and an electrically conducting fusible glue, so 
called "heat seal". This method however is very prolix and 
thereby expensive, especially when the LCD has contacts along two 
or more of its sides. The present invention offers a low-price and practical solution 
of the above mentioned

A method of assembling a price-marking device (1) 
including a LCD (30) and a printed circuit board (20) containing 

control electronics and power supply, for the connection of the 
thin LCD (30) to the underlying printed circuit board (20) by 

means of a connection device of conductive rubber in form of a 
so called zebra contact strip (15), said method comprising the steps of 


compressing by means of an extruded housing (10) said zebra 
contact strip (15) in a direction across the conducting rubber 

areas between said LCD (30) and said printed circuit board,

between the underlying printed circuit board and corresponding 
terminals of the LCD, so that said longitudinal parallel enclosing edges act as a lever exerting pressure against 

a front glass (33) constituting a front side of the LCD, thereby 
accomplishing a desired compression to the conducting rubber of 

said zebra contact (15) of at least 15%.
