<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a photoconductive imaging
member and to a process for preparing same. More specifically, the present invention
is directed to processes employing Lewis acid-pigment solubilization for fabricating
solution coated photosensitive pigment layers, and photo- and opto-electronic devices
and imaging members thereof.Known pigment attrition processes involve reduction of pigment particle size
by high energy grinding or attrition typically conducted in a dispersion medium. The
resulting pigment dispersion is then used to cast pigmented layers on selected
substrates by, for example, spray, dip, or spin coating techniques. Although fine
pigment particles can be obtained by prolonged attrition processing, the resulting
pigment dispersions often reagglomerate in time. A wide variety of pigment
dispersants have been employed to avoid rapid aggregate formation with different
varying degrees of success. A binder resin, which may be solubilized in the molecular
pigment dispersion andlor precoated onto the substrates, is optionally used to provide
necessary mechanical strength for the deposited pigment layer or layers. Pigment
sublimation processes involve heating pigment particles under high vacuum to
vaporize the pigment molecules which are then condensed onto cooled substrates to
form a pigment layer. Pure pigment layers with high degree of uniformity are
achievable by the sublimation process. However, sublimation processing may be a
complicated and expensive proposition for large scale production operations.
Processes are also known for the preparation and purification of photosensitive
pigments involving sequential dissolution and reprecipitation of the pigment using, for
example, an organic or inorganic acid solvent system followed by a non solvent
system as disclosed, for example, in US-A-5,153,094 and 5,153,313. However, the
pigment solutions disclosed in these patents have not been used directly in the
preparation of photogenerating layers. Major disadvantages of using strong acid
solvent solutions for larger scale production of films of photoconductive pigments
include the highly corrosive and toxic nature of the acidic solvents; and acid solvents
are generally not sufficiently volatile and are difficult to remove from the films. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a
photoconductive imaging member.A further object of the present invention is to provide imaging members
containing certain photoconductive and photogenerating pigments in a
