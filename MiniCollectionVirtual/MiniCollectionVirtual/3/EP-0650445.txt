 VENTING AND DISPENSING CAP FOR A CONTAINERTechnical fieldThe present invention relates to a cap for a container for containing liquids. The cap according to the invention allows for the venting of the container as well as the dispensing of said liquid.Background of the inventionContainers for containing liquids have been extensively described in the art as well as their numerous possible applications. In particular, many inventions have been made relating to containers for containing liquids which generate pressure, such as bleach-containing compositions. Indeed, specific problems are associated with such liquids, 

in that the pressure which builds up inside a closed container containing such a liquid may raise safety issues, or lead to the deformation of the container.In the art, solutions to this problem have been proposed, for instance by designing containers of specific shapes, whereby the container has optimal resistance to pressure build-up, limiting the degree of deformation. This type of solution has the drawback that it limits the flexibility of shape, material selection and material thickness when designing such containers.Other solutions relate to various venting caps for such containers, which allow the gas generated inside the container to escape. Such caps have been described for instance in GB 2 032 892, where a cap is disclosed which comprises a liner juxtaposed to the top of the cap which allows for pressure relief via a thread in the side of the cap. An improvement to this type of cap is known, where the top of the cap further comprises recesses, whereby the liner flexes into said recess as the pressure inside the container builds up. The flexed liner allows for improved pressure relief over the caps in GB 2 032 892 via the recesses and the thread in the side of the cap.However, said venting caps have the drawback that the cap has to be removed from the container for the contained liquid to be dispensed. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a cap which allows for the venting of the container onto which said cap is affixed without the leakage of the liquid contained in the container, and which further allows for the dispensing of said liquid, without said cap having to be removed from said container.Furthermore, the caps of the prior art are incompatible for use with a container wherein the contained liquid is to be 

dispensed through a small opening such as a nozzle. It is therefore another object of the present invention to provide a venting and dispensing

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A cap for a container, said cap comprising an interior and an exterior, said cap comprising a body (1) and a closure (2) , said body comprising a side wall (3) and an adjoining top (4) , wherein said side wall comprises means (5) to let gases through to the ambient, wherein said top comprises at least one recess (6) on the interior, wherein said body further comprises an impermeable liner (7) juxtaposed to said interior of said top, characterized in that said top and said liner are pierced by a hole (8) , and that said body further comprises a tubular part (9) extending through the hole in said top and said liner, said tubular part having an exterior diameter corresponding to the diameter of said hole, and wherein a sealing means maintains said liner pressed against said interior of said top in a leak- tight manner.
2. A cap according to claim 1 wherein said means (5) is a screw thread on the interior of said side wall (3) .
3. A cap according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said tubular part is provided with an upper ring and a lower ring to provide said sealing means.
4. A cap according to claim 3 wherein said lower ring comprises a continuous protuberance (12) in a region adjacent to said hole.
5. A cap according to claim 3 or 4 wherein said lower ring extends throughout the diameter of the neck of the container, and said ring is provided with perforations (14). 


6. A cap according to any of claims 3-5 wherein said lower ring comprises an adjoining side wall (15) extending along the interior of the neck of the container.
7. A cap according to any of the preceding claims wherein the interior of said top further comprises a continuous protuberance (11) in a region adjacent to said hole.
8. A cap according to any of the preceding claims wherein said closure (2) is a flip top closure.
