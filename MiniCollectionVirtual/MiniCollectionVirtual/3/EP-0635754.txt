<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a flash bulb type thermal copying 
device which allows divided exposure to be carried out 

in a simple but highly efficient manner. The thermal 
copying device comprises an exposure unit (10) having a 

light radiating window (22), and a flash light source (24) 
for radiating flash light upon the light radiating 

window (22), a planar holder (50), detachably mounted on 
the exposure unit (10), carrying an assembly of an 

original and a heat sensitive recording medium placed 
one over the other in an intimate thermal contact, and 

moveable across the light radiating window (22) with a 
light transmitting region provided on one side thereof 

aligned with the light radiating window (22), and a feed 
drive device (30) and (86) for moving the holder (50) and the 

exposure unit (10) relative to each other across the 
light radiating window (22). The holder can also be used 

as a stencil printing device to increases its 
acceptability for home use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flash bulb type
thermal copying device, and in particular to a flash
bulb type thermal copying device which is suitable for
preparing master plates for thermal stencil printing,
and processing heat sensitive projection sheets or
transparencies for overhead projectors (OHP).A flash bulb type thermal copying device uses a
flash light source typically consisting of a xenon
discharge bulb, and the flash light produced by the
flash light source is radiated upon an assembly of an
original and a heat sensitive recording medium which
are placed closely one over the other so that the
temperature variations corresponding to the original
image may reproduce an identical image in the heat
sensitive recording medium.The heat sensitive recording media normally used
in such a flash bulb type thermal copying device
typically consist of heat sensitive stencil printing
master plate sheets, or heat sensitive projection
transparencies for OHP, and the flash bulb type thermal
copying device is often used as a plate making device
for a stencil printing device, or a device for
preparing projection transparencies for OHP.As a flash bulb type thermal copying device which
processes a heat sensitive sheet having a large area by
using a small number of flash light sources or a flash
light source of a limited intensity, there is known the
flash bulb type thermal copying device of the divided
exposure type, for instance the one disclosed in
Japanese patent laid open publication No. 60-161150 in
which a laminated assembly consisting of an original
sheet and a heat sensitive recording medium laid one 
over the other, and a light radiating surface unit
including a flash light source are incremented relative
to each other by a certain pitch. The flash light
source is activated every time the two parts are moved
relatively to each other by the prescribed pitch.In a thermal copying process, it is necessary for
the original and the heat sensitive recording medium to
be in a thermally close contact with each other during
the entire exposure process. In the case of the
divided exposure process described above, the original
and the heat sensitive medium must stay stationary to
each other until the original is entirely copied.Therefore, according to the conventional flash
bulb type thermal copying device, the original and the
heat sensitive recording medium are placed in a
stationary position, one over the other in close
contact by using negative pressure or the like, and the
light source is moved relative to
