<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyimide compositions, 
films, and electronic devices using polyimides, based on 
9,9-bis(perfluoroalkyl)xanthene-2,3,6,7-tetracarboxylic 
dianhydride or 9-aryl-9-(perfluoroalkyl)xanthene-2,3,6,7-tetracarboxylic 
dianhydride, and benzidine 
derivatives, which have been modified with 3,3',4,4'-biphenyl 
tetracarboxylic dianhydride or 2,2-bis(3,4-carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane 
dianhydride in order to 
provide low linear coefficient of thermal expansion and 
improved tensile elongation. Polyimides constitute a class of valuable polymers 
being characterized by thermal stability, inert 
character, usual insolubility in even strong solvents, 
good mechanical and electrical properties and high Tg, 
among others. Their precursors are usually polyamic 
acids, which may take the final imidized form either by 
thermal or by chemical treatment. Polyimides have always found a large number of 
applications requiring at least some of the 
aforementioned characteristics in numerous industries, 
and recently their applications have started increasing 
dramatically in electronic devices, especially as  
 
dielectrics. With continuously escalating sophistication 
in such devices, the demands on the properties and the 
property control are becoming rather vexatious. Especially for the electronics industry, 
improvements of polyimides are needed in forming tough, 
pin-hole free coatings, having low dielectric constant, 
low moisture absorption, low linear coefficient of 
thermal expansion, and good mechanical properties among 
others. It is not usually possible to maximize all 
properties, since many of them are antagonistic. Thus, 
only a compromised solution is usually achieved by at 
least partially sacrificing one or more of these 
properties in order to maximize a desired one. An especially important property for electronics, 
and other applications as well, is low linear thermal 
expansion coefficient. This is because in electronic 
components, differences in the expansion coefficients of 
the components that make up the electronic device can 
generate stresses in the device which may lead to 
premature device failure. As electronic components 
become ever smaller, control of stress becomes an ever 
greater concern, such that the thermal expansions of the 
various components of a device should be matched as 
closely as possible. Since the stress can generally be 
related to the product of the difference in thermal 
expansion of the components and the moduli of those 
components, control
