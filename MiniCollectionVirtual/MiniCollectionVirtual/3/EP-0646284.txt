<ABSTRACT>
An arc lamp suitable for use as a high intensity light source in a projection system is described. A reflector (44) is arranged to reflect the light produced by the arc into a directional light beam, secondary reflection means being arranged to direct part of the reflected beam so as to compensate for regions which are obscured by the electrodes. Means are provided within the light source to dissipate heat generated by the electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light source
and, particularly, to a high intensity light source
for use in a projection system.The invention has particular application to light
sources for use with spatial light modulator
devices.A spatial light modulator is an optical device
which is controllable so as to modulate an incident
light beam. Colour spatial light modulators are known
in which beams of different colours are reflected
from different spatial light modulator devices, each
driven in accordance with a different video signal.
The coloured modulated beams are then combined to form
a single projected colour display.One known type of light modulators is an active
matrix device, comprising a matrix of individually
addressed pixels in the form of light valves or
modulators. A system having an array of liquid
crystal light modulators is described in EP-A-0401912
in which light is variably transmittable through each
element of the array which in turn modulates the
amplitude of the light passing through that element.A tiltable mirror device is disclosed in
US-A-4856863, which shows devices having miniature 
mirrored elements, wherein each element includes
electrodes and is arranged to be electro-statically
deflectable between two positions, the extent of
deflection being controllable by the extent of the
applied electro-static potential. Such devices may
also be operated in a binary mode, in which each
mirrored element is arranged to switch between two
discrete deflection states, so as to reflect incident
light into either a first position or a second
position, so as to represent light or dark in the
final output beam.Using a tiltable mirror device, as each mirrored
element is individually addressable, a two dimensional
image can be reproduced by exposing the array to an
incident light beam, modulating the incident beam by
controlling the individual mirror devices from a video
signal and collating the beam reflected in a
particular direction. The small size of the mirrored
elements, together with their very fast switching
times, allows the elements to be operated at video
rates, facilitating the display of a real time video
image.The incident beam does not scan the array, in the
way in which an electron beam scans in a cathode ray
tube, but is arranged to illuminate the entire device. 
Thus, given that a high intensity output is desirable
in a projection system, it is desirable to illuminate
the device with a high intensity beam. A system of
this type is described in international application
