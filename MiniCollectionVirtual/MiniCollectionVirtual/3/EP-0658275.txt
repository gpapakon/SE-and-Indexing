A device for preventing welding of the switch contacts of a heavy duty electromechanical relay comprises means (15, 16 and 17) adapted in use for monitoring the voltage supply to the relay coil (2) and detecting low voltage excursions therein. A counter (14) counts the number of low voltage excursions in the voltage supply to the relay coil (2) and an electronic switch (12) disconnects the voltage supply to the relay (2) if the number of low voltage excursions counted exceeds a predetermined number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
preventing the welding of the switch contacts in a 
heavy duty electromechanical relay. It is of 
particular significance to heavy duty relays used in 
automotive applications where cost considerations 
preclude the use of materials for the switch contacts 
which would give a better mechanical resistance to 
contact welding. In many cases, heavy duty electromagnetic switches 
use plain copper switch contacts which have a high 
tendancy to fuse together when breaking inductive, high 
current, loads. In order to prevent this from 
occurring, the switch contactor is frequently fitted 
with a return spring which has a high load versus 
compression factor. This spring exerts sufficient 
force to the moving contactor to break any contact 
fusing which might occur as the relay is de-energised. 
Provided that the relay coil is well designed and the 
coil voltage is close to its design parameter then the 
contactor usually survives its service life without 
catastrophic welding. However, particularly in the 
automotive environment, maintenance of the coil voltage 
at its design parameter is difficult because even under  
 
normal conditions, the high currents demanded by heavy 
duty motors (e.g. starter motors) and lighting circuits 
(e.g. the cold resistance of halogen lamps) can cause 
low voltage excursions to occur. In the case of an 
electromechanical relay controlling the supply of 
heavy current to a D.C. starter motor, the following 
situation typically occurs. The potential difference across the vehicle 
battery is close to the designed coil voltage, 
typically 12 volts, but due to a high resistance path 
in the battery/motor circuit, at the instant that high 
current is drawn, the potential across the coil is 
reduced to a value which is below the drop out level of 
the electromagnetic switch. Consequently, the switch 
contacts are broken. However, at the instant the 
switch contacts are broken, the heavy load current is 
removed and the potential difference across the coil 
returns to a level at which the switch contacts are 
closed. This sequence repeats itself and an 
oscillatory situation therefore arises in which the 
switch contacts are switched in and out at a relatively 
high frequency. This is sometimes referred to as 
"doorbelling" or "fizzing". Of course, when this 
occurs severe arcing and plasma generation occur at the 
gap between the switch contacts. This rapidly 
increases the temperature of the switch contacts and if  
 
the condition is
