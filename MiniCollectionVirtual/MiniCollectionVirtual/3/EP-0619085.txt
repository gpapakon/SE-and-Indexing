<ABSTRACT>
A separable fastening component has a base (1) and a plurality 
of independent fastening element (6) provided thereon. 

Each fastening element (6) comprises a bundle (4) of raised 
fibers (5) with a grape cluster like aggregate of swollen 

heads (2) consolidated together by fusion of the fiber ends 
and a trunk having a shape that tightens at the root and 

broadens towards the heads. This fastening component may be 
part of a male-female separable fastener.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separable fastening
component being widely used in the field of clothing. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a thin,
flexible separable fastening component having a sufficient
engaging force and an agreeable touch, which is suitably
used for disposable diapers and like applications that
directly or indirectly contact the human skin.Known separable fasteners include what is known as hook-type
separable fastener comprising a female fastening
component comprising a base and a multiplicity of loops
provided thereon (hereinafter sometimes referred to as
"female surface") and a male fastening component comprising
a base and, provided thereon, a multiplicity of hook-shaped
fastening elements formed from thick monofilaments (see, for
example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 522/1960) and a
what is known as mushroom-type separable fastener comprising
a male fastening component comprising a base and, provided
thereon, a multiplicity of mushroom-shaped fastening
elements formed by fusing and swelling the ends of thick
thermoplastic resin monofilaments with a hot plate or like
means and the above female separable fastening component
(see, for example Japanese Patent Publication No. 22501/1978 
and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 38734/1974).
With both of these separable fasteners, the hook-shaped
fastening elements or mushroom-shaped fastening elements of
the male separable fastener (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as "male surface") engage with the loops of the female
separable fastener, to produce an engaging force.
Accordingly, these fasteners are of male-female type. On
the other hand, also known is a male-male type (homo-type)
which uses a combination of the same two male fastening
components, comprising fastening elements comprising a
multiplicity of bundles which comprises a plurality of
monofilaments with their tips being fused together (see
Japanese Patent Publication No. 12340/1970 and Japanese
Utility Model Application Laid-open No. 123106/1992).However, the above hook-type male separable fastening
component should have a limited height of the hooks, since
the hooks are prepared by inserting the tip of a clipper
into loops constituting precursors for the hooks and hence
the height of the loops, i.e. that of the hooks formed
therefrom, is so restricted as to be able to introduce the
clipper. Consequently, attempts to make thin the hook-type
fastening component have only succeeded in obtaining a minimum
thickness including the base of about

<CLAIMS>
A separable fastening component comprising a plurality
of independent fastening elements (6) provided on a base (1)

and each comprising a bundle (4) comprising 4 to 60 fibers
(5) raising from substantially one point on the base surface

(1a), wherein the fibers (5) in the bundle each have a
fineness of 5 to 100 den (1 den = 1/9 tex) and a swollen head

(2), the heads (2) of the fibers (5) being at least partially
consolidated by being fused together, characterized in that

said fiber bundle (4) tightens at the root and broadens
towards the top end of the bundle.
The fastening component of claim 1, wherein the swollen
fiber heads (2) have non-uniform shapes and are disposed at

non-uniform heights above the base surface (1a).
The fastening component of claims 1 or 2, wherein said
fastening elements (6) are arranged in pairs, with the

fastening elements forming a pair being located at a distance
smaller than the spacing between the pairs.
The fastening component of claim 3, wherein the swollen
head parts of the two fastening elements (6) constituting a

pair are consolidated in at least part of said pairs.
The fastening component of claim 3 or 4, wherein the
fastening elements (6) constituting a pair are arranged in

such relative positions that they form an X-shape.
The fastening component of any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein a fiber bundle (4) has a total fineness of 50 to 300

den.
