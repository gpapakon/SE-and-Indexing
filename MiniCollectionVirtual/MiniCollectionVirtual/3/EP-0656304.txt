<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement disclosed comprises at least one transport module (1) 
moved along two parallel rails (5,6) defining a closed path and running 

on them with rolling friction through articulated trolleys (3) 
pivotally mounted on the structure of the module and each 

comprising a pair of antifriction bearings (13) inclined so as to 
touch the respective rail in two points spaced 90° in the cross-section 

plane of the rail.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for transporting
articles along a closed path comprising a guide defining the
path, at least one transport module movable with rolling friction
on the guide and means for dragging the module along the path.Arrangements of the above-mentioned type are employed in several
fields. In the field of industrial automation, e.g., they are
used as collecting/sorting systems in assembly lines, while in
postal automation they are used for the sorting and forwarding of
bulky letter, packages and the like.U.S.Patent N° 4,310,276 discloses a machine for transporting
objects from a leading station to a sorting station, wherein the
objects are loaded on mobile carriages slidable along a monorail
guide each through a pully rolling on the upper surface of the
rail and a pair of rollers which slidably engage with the
opposite sides of the lower portion of the guide.This machine and other similar in the art have the drawback that
along curved portions of the path sliding friction is generated
between the rail and parts rolling on it which, besides reducing
the speed, causes vibrations and unbalances that make the module
noisy and, in addition, can cause derailment of the module with
consequences easy to conceive.Moreover, such devices are unstable in the sense that, being not
constrained enough to the rail, entail limitation in speed and in
the transversal inclination of the guide. The general object of the present invention is to overcome the
drawbacks of the prior art and provide an arrangement for
transporting articles along a closed path defined by a guide
which features low noisiness, high transportation speed, short
replacement time and, moreover, is inexpensive.Another object of the present invention is to provide a transport
module for closed path defined by a guide which is stable, i.e.
capable of operating with any transverse inclination of the guide
without limiting the velocity of the module and, moreover, is
balanced and does not cause vibrations.These and other objects of the invention, which will become more
apparent hereinafter, are achieved, in accordance with the present
invention, by an arrangement for transporting articles along a
closed path, of the type comprising at least one transport module
movable with rolling friction along a guide defining the path,
the arrangement being characterized in that the guide consists in
at least two parallel tubular rails, that the module is slidably
engaged with each of the rails through articulated trolleys
distributed

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for transporting articles along a closed path of
the type comprising a guide defining said path, at least one

transport module (1) movable with roller friction on said guide,
and means (4, 7, 8, 9, 17) for dragging said module along said path,

characterized in that said guide is composed of at least two
parallel tubular rails (5, 6) and said at least one module is

slidably engaged with each of the rails through articulated
trolleys (3) distributed in such a way that at least one rail is

engaged with at least two articulated trolleys, each trolley
being rotatable about an axis (y-y) perpendicular to the respective

rail (6) and abuts on it through at least two antifriction
bearings (13) touching it at at least a pair of points, each point

being at an angular distance of 90° in the plane of the rail
cross-section.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that said
dragging means comprise a flexible driving member (9) anchored to

said at least one module (1) and extending parallelly to said
rails, and a motor (9) for moving said driving member.
Arrangement according to claim 2, characterized in that said
driving member (7) is a chain.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that each
of said articulated trolleys (3) comprises:


a substantially cylindrical body (11) having an axis (y-y)
perpendicular to the respective rail and terminating

coaxially at one end with a hub (11a) insertable in a sintered
self-lubricating bush (14) rigidly fixed to the structure of 

said module, and
at least one pair of antifriction bearings (13) mounted on pins
rigidly fixed into said cylindrical body (11) and each making an

angle of 45° with said axis (y-y).
Constrained module (1) for transporting objects on a closed path,
moved with rolling friction by dragging means (4, 7, 8, 9, 17) on a pair of

parallel rails (5, 6) having tubular cross-section and defining said
closed path, said module comprising:


a plate-like structure (2) parallel to the strip delimited by
the rails and extending transversely thereof and supporting

the container for the transported objects, said plate-like
structure having its ends (2a, 2b) bent perpendicularly to said

strip, and
at least three articulated trolleys (3) pivoted on said bent
ends, alternately distributed thereon and extending inwards

to abut on the respective rail and each touching it at two
points located at an angular distance of 90° in the plane

of the rail cross-section.
Constrained transport module for closed path according to
claim 5, characterized in that each of said articulated

trolleys comprises:

a substantially cylindrical body (11) having an axis (y-y)
perpendicular to the respective rail and terminating

coaxially at one end with a hub (11a) inserted in a sintered
self-lubricating bush (14) rigidly fixed on the respective bent

portion of said plate-like structure, and
at least one pair of antifriction bearings (13) mounted on pins 
rigidly fixed into said cylindrical body (11) and each making an

angle of 45° with said axis.
Module according to claims 5 and 6, characterized in that at
