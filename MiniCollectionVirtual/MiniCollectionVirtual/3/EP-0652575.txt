electrolytic capacitor having oxide film (4) of valve action metal (1) 

as a dielectric substance and conducting polymer as solid electrolyte. 
The method includes the steps of forming solid monomer compound on a 

surface of the oxide film (4) by applying monomer compound solution 
to the surface and then drying the monomer compound solution, and 

forming a conducting polymer layer (5) by polymerizing the solid 
monomer compound with an oxidizer. The method provides a capacitor 

having a quite small impedance in a resonant frequency and also having 
a superior high frequency characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a solid 
electrolytic capacitor having electrically conductive high polymer as a 
solid electrolyte, and more particularly to a method for manufacturing 
such a solid electrolytic capacitor having a superior frequency 
characteristic. In general, a solid electrolytic capacitor includes a first 
electrode or an anode composed of porous compact of valve action 
metal such as tantalum (Ta) and aluminum (Al), a dielectric substance 
composed of oxide film of the anode, and a second electrode or a 
cathode composed of solid electrolyte such as manganese dioxide 
(MnO2) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) complex salt. The 
solid electrolyte is required to have functions for electrically 
connecting an entire dielectric substance disposed in the porous 
compact to leads of the electrodes, and for repairing electrical short-circuit 
derived from defects of the dielectric oxide film. Accordingly, 
it is not allowed to use metal having high electrical conductivity but 
having no function for repairing electrical short-circuit as a solid 
electrolyte. For instance, manganese dioxide (MnO2), which can be 
converted to insulative material due to heat generated by short-circuit 
current, has been often used as a solid electrolyte. However, a solid electrolytic capacitor having manganese 
dioxide (MnO2) as a part of an electrode cannot have a sufficiently 
large electrical conductivity, and hence has to have a large impedance 
in high frequency band. In addition, such a solid electrolytic capacitor 
can have only a poor thermal resistance, because TCNQ complex salt is 
easy to be thermally decomposed. Recently, new materials have been developed in the field of  
 
high polymer. For instance, there has been developed a conducting 
polymer including conjugate high polymer such as polyacetylene, polyp-phenylene, 
polypyrrole and polyaniline to which is added a dopant or 
an electron donative and/or electron attractive compound. For instance, Japanese Unexamined Patent Public Disclosure 
No. 64-24410 has suggested a method for manufacturing a conducting 
polymer layer by introducing monomer of conducting polymer into a 
surface of oxide film which plays a role of dielectric substance in 
liquid phase, and then adding thereto an oxidizer solution including an 
organic acid. On the conducting polymer layer are formed electrodes 
each composed of a graphite layer and a silver paste layer. Japanese Unexamined Patent Public Disclosure No.2-74019 
has suggested a
