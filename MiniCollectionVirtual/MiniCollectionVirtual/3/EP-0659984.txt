<ABSTRACT>
A variable engine valve control system and method of 
operation thereof wherein each of the reciprocating engine 

valves is hydraulically or electrically controlled and can 
vary its lift schedule for various engine operating 

conditions. During part load operation of the engine, the 

intake valve (102) is opened and the exhaust valve (100) is 
closed during the exhaust stroke, prior to a piston's top 

dead centre position, so that the intake port (108) receives 
exhaust gas, which is then returned to the cylinder (112) 

during the intake stroke to eliminate the need for an 
external exhaust gas recirculation system and to improve 

fuel evaporation into the intake air. Further, during part 
load, the intake valve (102) is closed before the end of the 

intake stroke and the intake air is heated by a heat 
exchanger (116) prior to entry into the cylinder (112) to 

eliminate the need for air throttling without compromising 
the compression ratio and ignition characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems and methods
of operation thereof for variably controlling internal
combustion engine intake and exhaust valves. More
specifically, it relates to camless engine valve systems
and methods of operation in engines used to eliminate the
need for external exhaust gas recirculation and air
throttling.Conventional automotive internal combustion engines
operate with one or more camshafts controlling the timing
and lift of the intake and exhaust valves, according to a
predetermined lift schedule. With this type of mechanical
structure, the lift schedule is fixed. However, under
different engine operating conditions, the optimum lift
schedule varies. Thus, the lift schedule must be a
compromise of the optimum lift schedule needed for the
different operating conditions. To accommodate full
throttle engine operation, which requires significant air
intake, an aggressive lift schedule must be used. At part
load operating conditions, however, the intake air must then
be throttled to prevent too much air from entering the
cylinder. Consequently, this causes parasitic losses due to
the throttling.It is desirable to eliminate throttling losses by
eliminating the need for an air throttle, without losing the
effective compression ratio. One possible way to accomplish
this is to close the intake valve before piston bottom dead
centre (BDC) during the intake stroke. However, the gas in
the cylinder will then experience expansion during the end
of the intake stroke with resultant cooling. Cooling of the
gas can be detrimental to engine performance. Therefore,
the need arises for a way to maintain the proper temperature
of the gas at combustion when it undergoes a cooling due to
expansion during the end of the intake stroke. This would 
improve combustion characteristics and provide better fuel
economy.Further, in internal combustion engines used in
vehicles today, some of the exhaust gas is recirculated, by
an external exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, to
control the nitrogen oxide formation and to retain the
maximum unburned hydrocarbons in the cylinder and allow for
hotter intake gas for better evaporation of fuel. It is
desired to eliminate the need for an external EGR system to
reduce the cost and complexity that yields increased
maintenance requirements. Additionally, for environmental
reasons, it is desired to maintain as much of the unburned
hydrocarbons in the cylinder as possible rather than
allowing them to flow out in the exhaust.It is understood that the distribution

A method of operating an engine valve control system in an
internal combustion engine wherein ambient intake air is

selectively heated prior to entry into an engine cylinder (112)
on opening an intake valve (102) of the cylinder (112);

characterised by the step of

closing the intake valve (102) prior to a piston's bottom dead
centre position during an intake stroke within the cylinder

(112) such that the intake air will be at an ambient
temperature when the piston (110) reaches approximately the

position of bottom dead centre.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the intake
valve (102) is opened before piston top dead centre during an

exhaust stroke such that some combustion gas will exit the
cylinder through the intake valve.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the method
further comprises closing an exhaust valve (100) in the

cylinder before piston top dead centre during the exhaust
stroke.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
step of selectively heating comprises receiving the ambient

intake air into an intake inlet (122), selectively diverting
part of the ambient intake air through a heat exchange

mechanism, and supplying exhaust gas to the heat exchange
mechanism whereby the exhaust gas will heat the ambient intake

air prior to entry of the intake air into the cylinder. 
A valve control system cooperating with a piston and
cylinder in an internal combustion engine comprising:


an intake port (108), coupled to the cylinder (112), having
an intake valve (102) therein,
an exhaust port (106), coupled to the cylinder
(112),having an exhaust valve (100) therein ; and
a heat exchanger (116) having a heat exchange mechanism
(118), an exhaust gas inlet (134) and an exhaust gas outlet

(136), and an intake air inlet (122) and an intake air outlet
(132), with the exhaust inlet (134) being coupled to the

exhaust port (106) and coupled through the heat exchange
mechanism (118) to the exhaust outlet (136); and the intake

outlet (132) being coupled to the intake port (108) and being
selectively coupled to an intake inlet (122) through the heat

exchange mechanism (118) and around the heat exchange
mechanism;
with the heat exchanger (116) further having means (120)
for selectively routing intake air through the heat exchange

mechanism (118)

characterised in that

the system is electrohydraulically operated;
the intake valve (102) is selectively closable before and
after piston (110) bottom dead centre; and
the amount of intake inlet air that passes through the
heat exchange mechanism (118) is a function of the closing of

the intake valve (102) relative to the piston's bottom dead
centre position.
A valve control system according to claim 5, wherein
the intake valve is openable during the exhaust stroke prior

to piston top dead centre and the exhaust valve is closable
prior to piston top dead centre such that some of the exhaust

gasses will enter the intake port. 
A valve control system according to claim 5 or claim

shiftable between first and second positions, each within a
respective enclosed cylinder head bore and chamber (30) in a

cylinder head member (12) affixed to the engine;

said system also comprising:

a hydraulic actuator having a two valve pistons (26), one
each coupled to the intake valve (102) and the exhaust valve

(100) and reciprocable within their respective enclosed
chambers (30), thereby forming a first and a second cavity (25,

27) within each chamber, which vary in displacement as the
engine valves move;
in the cylinder head member (12), a high pressure port
(48) extending between the first and second cavities (25, 27)

of each chamber and the high pressure source of fluid (40), and
a low pressure port (50) extending between the first cavity

(25) of each chamber and the low pressure source of fluid (50);
a pair of high pressure valves (64) and a pair of low
pressure valves (68), one high pressure valve and one low

pressure valve for respectively regulating the flow of fluid
in each of the first cavities (25); and
control means (74) cooperating with the high and low
pressure valves for selectively coupling the first cavities

(25) to the high pressure and low pressure source to oscillate
the intake and exhaust valves in timed relation to engine

operation, wherein during each oscillation, some of the high
pressure fluid is used to reciprocate the valves is returned

to the high pressure source, thereby allowing that the net
fluid flow between the high pressure and low pressure sources

may be substantially less than the volume swept by the valve
pistons.
