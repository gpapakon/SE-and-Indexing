<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns spinal fixation systems,
and particularly spinal hooks for engaging portions of a
vertebra. More specifically, the present invention concerns
improvements in the manner of connecting the spinal hook to a
rod used in the spinal fixation system.Several techniques and systems have been developed for
correcting and stabilizing spinal curves and facilitating
spinal fusion. In one system, a bendable rod is
longitudinally disposed adjacent the vertebral column and is
fixed to various vertebra along the length of the column by
way of a number of fixation elements. A variety of fixation
elements can be provided which are configured to engage
specific portions of the vertebra.The present invention specifically concerns one type of
fixation element, that is a spinal compression/distraction
hook of the type used in connection with the bendable rod.
The spinal hooks are used to anchor the rod relative to the
spinal column, as well as to provide a path for compression
or distraction loading of the vertebra.An example of one such system is the TSRH™ spinal
system of Danek Medical, Inc. In this system, a spinal hook,
such as hook H shown in FIG. 1, is engaged to the fixation
rod R by way of a eyebolt assembly E. As is known in the
art, the eyebolt E is threaded onto the spinal rod and
captured within yokes on the spinal hook. A nut is threaded
onto the threaded post of the eyebolt to clamp the yoke
between the nut and the fixation rod R. The eyebolt E and
hook yokes provide three degrees of fixation as represented
by the arrows in FIG. 1. Details of the TSRH™ spinal
implant system are disclosed in the "TSRH™ Surgical 
Technique Manual" provided by Danek Medical, Inc. published
in 1990 which disclosure is incorporated herein by
reference.It is the goal of the surgeon using such spinal implant
systems as the Danek TSRH™ system to apply the vertebral
fixation elements, such as the spinal hook, to the spine in
the appropriate anatomic position, and then to engage each
fixation element to the spinal rod. It has been found that
in spite of the great benefits provided by the double-yoke
spinal hooks, such as hook H in FIG. 1, certain problems
arise which have heretofore not been adequately addressed.One problem with the spinal hooks H of the prior art is
that the hooks are rather bulky and wide since the fixation
yokes of the hook are configured to surround the spinal rod
R. The size or bulkiness of the spinal hook is an especially
important problem since a significant portion of the patient

<CLAIMS>
A spinal fixation device for interengaging a fixation rod (29) with the human
spine, comprising:


a lower portion (11) configured to engage a portion of a vertebra in the human
spine; and
a top portion (15) integrally formed on said lower portion (11), said top
portion (15) including only a plurality of posts (17) projecting therefrom, each of said

plurality of posts (17) having mutually coplanar first lateral surfaces (27) and each
including a groove (22) formed in said first lateral surface (27), each of said grooves

(22) being coaxial and adapted to engage a fixation rod (29), characterised in that
each of said plurality of posts (17) includes mutually coplanar second lateral surfaces

(27) opposite said first lateral surfaces (27), each of said second lateral surfaces (27)
including a second groove (22) formed therein, each of said second grooves (22)

being coaxial and adapted to engage the fixation rod (29).
A spinal fixation device according to claim 1, wherein a pair of said plurality
of posts (17) includes opposite outwardly facing end surfaces (28), each of said end

surfaces (28) having an elongated slot (25) defined therein for engaging an insertion
instrument (60).
A spinal fixation device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said top portion
(15) is symmetrical about a plane extending parallel to and between said first and

second lateral surfaces (27).
A spinal fixation device according to claim 3, wherein said lower portion (11)
is symmetric about said plane. 
A spinal fixation device according to any preceding claim, wherein said first
and second grooves (22) of each of said plurality of posts (17) are defined at a groove

radius, said groove radius being less than the effective radius of the fixation rod (29).
A spinal fixation device according to any preceding claim, wherein said
plurality of posts includes only two posts.
A spinal fixation assembly for interengaging a fixation rod (29) with the
human spine comprising:


a spinal fixation device according to any one of claims 1 to 6; and
an eyebolt assembly (30) having a body with a bore (31) for receiving the
fixation rod (29), a threaded post (22) projecting from the body and a nut (33) for

engaging the threaded post (32);

whereby the fixation rod (29) can be received in one of said first groove (22)
or second groove (22) in the corresponding one of said first lateral surfaces (27) or

said second lateral surfaces (27), while said nut (33) of said eyebolt assembly (30) is
threaded along said post (32) extending through a slot (19) defined between said

plurality of posts (17) so as to clamp against the other of said first lateral surfaces (27)
or said second lateral surfaces (27).
