<ABSTRACT>
The electro-hydraulic adjusting device for actuating a device for moving at least one camshaft of an internal combustion engine in relation to its crankshaft has two differential pistons (42, 12), each of which serves to move a camshaft (inlet or outlet). A pump applies pressure to the small effective piston area (14, 40) of the two differential pistons (42, 12). To the pressure chambers (11, 44) at the larger effective piston area is allocated an independent pressure control valve (21, 46; 60) via which the pressure in said pressure chamber can be controlled independently of the other differential piston.

Camshaft adjusting device of an internal combustion 
engine, comprising a device for adjusting at least 

one camshaft of an internal combustion engine in relation 
to its crankshaft, having at least one differential 

piston (12, 42) whose smaller piston face (14, 40) can be 
acted on by a pump (16, 100) with pressure medium while 

the pressure in the pressure space (11, 44) can be varied 
at its larger piston face by means of an electromagnetically 

actuable control valve (21, 60), and having 
a second independent differential piston (42) whose 

smaller piston face (40) can be acted on by the pump (16, 
100) with pressure medium, while the pressure in the 

pressure space (11, 44) can be varied at its larger 
piston face by means of a second electromagnetically 

actuable control valve (21, 60), a second camshaft of the 
internal combustion engine being capable of being 

adjusted in relation to its crankshaft using this second 
independent differential piston (42), characterized in 

that the two control valves (21, 60) are connected to one 
another, and to the pump (16, 100), via a flow divider 

valve (63, 85). 
Camshaft adjusting device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that at least one throttle device (70, 

72) is connected in parallel with the flow divider valve 
(63, 85). 
Camshaft adjusting device according to one of 
Claims 1 to 2, characterized in that at least one adjustable 

overflow valve (32; 82, 83, 85, 86) is arranged 
between the pump (16, 100) and pressure control valve  

 
(21 or 60). 
Camshaft adjusting device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the overflow valve (82, 83, 85, 86) 

is arranged between the flow divider valve (63, 85) and 
the pressure control valve (21, 60). 
Camshaft adjusting device according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that a non-return valve 

(108, 110) is connected in parallel with the overflow 
valve (82, 83). 
Camshaft adjusting device according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a throttle device 

(104, 106) is connected in parallel with the overflow 
valve (82, 83).
