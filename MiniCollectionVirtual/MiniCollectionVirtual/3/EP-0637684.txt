<ABSTRACT>
Air/fuel ratio in an internal combustion engine is 
controlled so as to test the operation of an exhaust gas 

oxygen sensor. The engine (11) is divided into two banks, 
each bank including an intake bank of cylinders, an exhaust 

path, and an exhaust gas oxygen sensor (14,15) in the 
exhaust path. Air/fuel ratio control signals are used in 

connection with each of the two banks, the control signals 
being 180° out of phase with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlling air/fuel ratio of
an internal combustion engine having an electronic engine
control system.It is known to operate an internal combustion engine
using feedback controlled electronic engine control systems.
A feedback signal can be provided by an exhaust gas oxygen
sensor in the exhaust of the engine. The output signal from
such exhaust gas oxygen sensor can indicate whether the
engine is operating rich or lean of stoichiometry. This
information is then processed by an electronic engine
control module to adjust the air/fuel ratio by, for example,
adjusting the amount of fuel injected into a cylinder. To
ensure proper operation of such a feedback control system
and confirm that the exhaust gas oxygen sensor is operating
properly, it is known to test the exhaust gas oxygen sensor
during system operation. It is known from the specification of international patent
application WO 89/12737 to provide a method for lamda
control which operates with two control circuits for
respective groups of cylinders. Two-point control is
operated in each control circuit, causing control
oscillations. The phase shift from one control circuit to
the other is half an oscillation period such that the
exhaust gas from one group of cylinders changes from rich to
lean when the exhaust gas from the other changes from lean
to rich, and vice versa. The two quantities of exhaust gas
are mixed upstream of a catalyser such that the catalyser
receives a gas mixture with a lamda value of substantially
one.US patent specification 4 703 735 discloses a multi-cylinder
engine having two groups of cylinders and two exhaust gas
sensors to detect the air-fuel ratios of the intake mixtures
of the two groups of cylinders respectively. The air-fuel
ratio of each group of cylinders is controlled by a
respective closed loop integration circuit based on the
outputs of the exhaust gas sensors. The integration circuits
operate in phase reverse to one another.The abstract of the Japanese patent specification JP-A-59
82547 discloses the application of a dither signal to the
control signal in a feedback control circuit from an exhaust
gas sensor. The input gas mixture is therefore made to
oscillate between rich and lean while the performance of the
feedback circuit is monitored.Unwanted side effects of driving the sensor at a fixed
frequency using rich and lean air/fuel ratio excursions are
torque, engine speed, and engine load oscillations at the
driven frequency. This invention overcomes such undesired
side effects.In
