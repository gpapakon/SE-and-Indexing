(21) for dividing the 
vacuum chamber into a first sub-chamber and a second sub-chamber, the

the first sub-chamber and the second sub-chamber even when the opening 

is open. A gate valve (22) is provided on the partitioning means for 
hermetically closing the opening of the partitioning means so as to shut 

off the molecular flows between the first sub-chamber and the second 
sub-chamber. At least two evaporation source sets each comprising at

with an internal space of the vacuum chamber and designed to deposit a 

thin film at different deposition positions in the second sub-chamber and a

for evacuating 
the first sub-chamber to an ultra high vacuum. 

A rotatable sample holder (5) 
is located within the second sub-chamber having at least two heads for 

holding substrate to be deposited so as to face different directions, the 
sample holder is rotatable so that the heads can be situated at the different 

deposition positions. The apparatus further comprises means (5a) for 
heating 

the substrates, a gas supplying means (7) provided in the 
second sub-chamber 

so as to supply a predetermined gas to the second sub-chamber and an

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film depositing apparatus and a
process for preparing a layered structure including an oxide
superconductor thin film, and more specifically to an improved film
depositing apparatus particularly for preparing a layered structure
including an oxide superconductor thin film and a dielectric thin film
and/or an insulator thin film, which has a clear interface with negligible
interface states, high crystallinity and excellent properties.Oxide superconductors have been found to have higher critical
temperatures than those of metal superconductors, and therefore
considered to have good possibility of practical application. For example,
Y-Ba-Cu-O type oxide superconductor has a critical temperature higher
than 80 K and it is reported that Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O type oxide
superconductor and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O type oxide superconductor have
critical temperatures higher than 100 K.In case of applying the oxide superconductor to superconducting
electronics including superconducting devices and superconducting 
integrated circuits, the oxide superconductor has to be used in the form of
a thin film having a thickness of a few nanometers to some hundreds
micrometers. It is considered to be preferable to utilize various
deposition methods, such as sputtering methods, laser ablation methods
and reactive co-evaporation methods for forming oxide superconductor
thin films. In particular, it is possible to deposit an oxide superconductor
thin film atomic layer by atomic layer through utilizing a reactive
co-evaporation method. Additionally, in-situ observation during and
between depositing thin film is possible so that a high quality oxide
superconductor thin film can be obtained by the reactive co-evaporation
method.In order to deposit an oxide superconductor thin film on a substrate
by the reactive co-evaporation method, constituent elements of the oxide
superconductor excluding oxygen are supplied as molecular beams
towards the substrate by using Knudsen's cell (abbreviated to K cell
hereinafter) type molecular beam sources. In addition, an oxidizing gas
such as O2 including O3, NO2 or N2O is supplied near the substrate so that
the molecular beams are oxidized so as to form the oxide superconductor
thin film on the substrate. It is also possible to deposit high quality thin
films of ferroelectrics such as SrTiO3 and of nonsuperconducting oxide
such as Pr1Ba2Cu3O7-y. Furthermore, by switching molecular beam
sources, it is possible to deposit thin films of different materials or
compositions
