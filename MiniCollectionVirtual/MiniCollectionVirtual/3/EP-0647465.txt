<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microfiltration and/or 
ultrafiltration membrane consisting of a polymer having 

nominal pores of 0.001 - 10 µm. The special feature of the 
membranes according to the invention is that the matrix of the 

membrane incorporates an active adsorbent which is preferably 
polyvinyl polypyrrolidon. 
Usually the polyvinyl polypyrrolidon is present in 

the membrane in an amount of 5 - 90 % by weight and preferably 
in an amount of 30 - 70 % by weight. 
Preferably the membrane is hydrophillic and is 
usually asymmetric or is constructed of different layers. 
The nominal pore size of the membrane is 0.05 - 5 µm 
and preferably 0.2 - 1.0 µm, while the membrane is tubular, 

flat or capillary. 
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of the 
preparation of the membrane and to a method of the filtration 

of undissolved components from a liquid and/or the 
simultaneous adsorption of dissolved components from the 

liquid by means of the membrane according to the invention. 
The method according to the invention is especially 
suitable for the removal of components causing turbidity from 

a liquid, especially beer, by means of the membrane according 
to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a microfiltration and/or
ultrafiltration membrane, to a method of its preparation and
to methods of removing dissolved and/or undissolved components from
a liquid by means of such a membrane.Membranes are known from the prior art which
can, for instance, be used for the filtration
of all kinds of liquids containing solid components. These
membranes can, for instance be used for the removal of yeast
cells causing turbidity from unfiltered beer or for the
treatment of unfiltered fruit juices.However, the disadvantage of such a filter is that
when, for example, it is used for the filtration of beer,
dissolved components, such as polyphenols, are allowed to pass
through, which by reacting with proteins can after a time
cause turbidity. Naturally this is not desirable as such
turbidity takes away the very essential characteristic of
beer, namely clearness.It is also known that the polyphenols causing such
turbidity can be removed from the beer, which is first
filtered in order to remove the insoluble components such as
yeast etc., by adding polyvinyl polypyrrolidon in powder form.
The undesirable polyfenols are adsorbed by polyvinyl
polypyrrolidon (PVPP) and the solid PVPP particles are then
removed from the beer by filtration.Traditionally one used kieselguhr filters for the
clarification of beer, however, a disadvantage is that they
produce much waste. These kieselguhr or diatomaceous earth
filters have lately been replaced by cross-flow
microfiltration.Such a membrane is, for instance, described in
applicant's US-A-No. 4,798,847. FR- A- 2 295 771 discloses a process for removing turbidity causing dissolved
impurities (such as polyphenols) and undissolved impurities from liquids such as beer,
wherein the liquid to be purified is passed through a wet laid sheet (ie a "dynamic"
membrane") comprising specific polyamide adsorbent particles. PVPP particles are
only used for comparative purposes.A similar technique is used according to EP- A- 0 351 363: A "dynamic" membrane of
adsorbent particles (eg a mixture of PVPP particles and other fibres or particles) is
formed on a filter membrane before and during the filtration.WO- A- 86/06589 discloses the use solvent- cast microporous films/membranes made
from specific polyamides for removing polyphenols from liquids (eg beer). It is
suggested to incorporate, by co- precipitation, "inert" powders such as diatomite earth
"for improving the polyphenol uptake".US- A- 4 943 374 discloses the separation of germs and turbidity causing substances
