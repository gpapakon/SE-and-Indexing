<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for removing screenings (3) from an intake channel (1) through which flows a contaminated liquid (2), having a screen device projecting in part into the liquid (2) and a motor-driven inclined rising screw conveyor device (4) leading to a discharge position (8), the screen device being constructed as a screen body provided with a surrounding wall and screen orifices and tapering in the direction (10) of flow of the liquid (2), e.g. a conical screen plate (11) and the screw conveyor device (4) being arranged in the inlet channel (1) and the direction (9) of transport being selected in such a way that the screenings (3) are transported away upwards at an incline against the direction (10) of flow of the liquid (2) in the inlet channel (1).

Device for removing raked material (3) from a 
supply channel (1) through which a contaminated 

liquid (2) flows, in particular of sewage treatment 
plants, with a liquid-permeable screen body (11) 

which both partly reaches as far as the bottom of 
the supply channel (1) and partly extends out of the 

liquid (2) and which rotates about an axis of 
rotation, wherein the screen body (11) is designed 

as a structure which is provided with a peripheral 
wall and screen openings (12) and which tapers in 

the direction of flow (10) of the liquid (2), and a 
motor-driven, obliquely upwardly directed conveying 

zone which extends partly into and adjoins this 
screen body (11) and leads to a discharge point (8) 

and is designed as a screw conveying device (4) and 
which comprises a housing (5) and a screw (6), 

characterised in that the screw conveying device 
(4), starting from the screen body (11), is arranged 

on the supply channel (1), in a direction opposite 
the direction of flow and at an angle thereto, and 

hence the direction of conveying is selected in such 
a way that the raked material (3) can be transported 

away obliquely upwardly in a direction opposite the 
direction of flow (10) of the liquid (2). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
screw conveying device (4) has arranged on the housing 

(5) an input opening (7) for the raked material (3) which 
is located on the top.  

 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the screen body is designed as a conical screen 

plate (11) tapering in the direction of flow (10). 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that the screen body is variable in its 

position relative to the direction of flow (10). 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that the screen openings (12) of the 

screen body are designed as holes, oblong holes, slots or 
in other suitable forms of openings. 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that the screen body on its side facing 

towards the flow (10) or its inner side has driver ribs 
(13) extending essentially radially or located on 

generatrices of the screen body or arranged in other 
directions. 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that the screen body and the screw 

conveying device (4) have a common axis of rotation (14) 
and/or a common drive device (15). 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that the drive shaft of the screen body 

is connected to the screw conveying device (4) by a ball, 
cardan or suitable joint. 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that the screen body and the screw  

 
conveying device (4) have different axes of rotation 

and/or drive shafts and/or different drive devices and 
the screen body is mounted separately from the screw 

conveying device (4). 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that screen body and screw conveying 

device (4) are adjustable independently of each other. 
Device according to one or more of the above claims, 
characterised in that baffle plates (17) are arranged on 

the bottom and lower wall region of the supply channel 
(1) and designed in such a way that they close the free 

openings formed by the supply channel (1) and the screen 
body operating therein, in a manner favourable to flow.
