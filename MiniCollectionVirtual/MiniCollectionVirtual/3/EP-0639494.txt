<ABSTRACT>
A conventional endless track is modified to accommodate 
widened rollers by fixing a plurality of supporting 

pads (20') to the grousers (8) of the endless track, the widened 
rollers riding directly on the supporting pads. The 

conventional endless track may be further modified to 
include rotatable bushings (9') over the existing drive pins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a replacement 
endless track for a heavy duty tracked vehicle. Endless 
tracks are used on heavy duty vehicles such as tractors, 
bulldozers, and tanks. As shown in Fig. 1, such a vehicle 
includes an endless track drive system 2 made up of a 
closed loop endless track 3 in conjunction with the 
necessary sprocketed drive wheel 4 and any necessary 
supporting wheels, such as opposite end wheel 5 and idler 
wheels or rollers 6. The endless track is installed so as 
to pass around the wheels 4, 5 and 6. Of course, the 
tracked vehicle is further equipped with the necessary 
power source and controls to power the endless track drive 
system and thereby propel the vehicle over varying terrain 
as desired. As seen in Fig. 2, one conventional endless track 
3 consists of two parallel rails 7 each comprised of a 
plurality of rail blocks 7' linked together and supporting 
a plurality of metal grousers 8. Metal drive pins 9 
between opposing rail blocks are engaged by the drive 
wheel sprocket to propel the vehicle. Drive pins 9 are 
typically driven into and retained by press fittings 10 in 
the rail blocks. Replaceable protective metal bushings 9' 
may be provided around drive pins 9 to protect the drive 
pins from wear, and a lubricant may be injected between 
drive pins 9 and bushings 9' from reservoirs in drive pins 
9 to reduce friction. Examples of this type of track are 
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,823,082; 
3,734,577; 3,955,855; 4,359,248; and 4,530,546. See also 
Caterpillar's Sealed and Lubricated Track brochure and 
U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,318. As seen in Fig. 2A, another conventional track 3A 
consists of a plurality of central guide members 7A and a 
plurality of metal grousers 8A. The grousers 8A are held 
together by a plurality of drive units 9A disposed on the 
peripheral edges of the track 3A. The drive units 9A are 
engaged by drive wheel sprockets to propel the vehicle.  
 
Each drive unit 9A includes a pair of laterally extending 
pins 10A and a connecting member 12A. Laterally extending 
pins 10A of adjacent grousers are fitted into one of 
connecting members 12A. The above-referenced conventional tracks have the 
disadvantages of being noisy and vibration prone, not 
sufficiently durable and/or not usable on road surfaces. 
This is because of the conventional configurations and use 
of metal parts. Accordingly, substantial efforts have 
been made to construct quieter, smoother operating and 
more durable tracks for tracked vehicles of
