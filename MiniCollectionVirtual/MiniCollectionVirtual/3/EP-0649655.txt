<ABSTRACT>
This invention comprises a pharmaceutical 
composition comprising a benzimidazole compound having 

antiulcer activity and a water-soluble carboxylic acid 
amide. According to this invention, a water-insoluble 

benzimidazole compound having antiulcer activity can be 
solubilized and a stable pharmaceutical composition can 

be provided. The solid pharmaceutical composition of 
this invention can be extemporaneously dissolved in 

sterile distilled water or an infusion (e.g. 
physiological saline, glucose infusion, etc.) and put 

to use as an injection with great convenience.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition 
comprising a benzimidazole compound having 
antiulcer activity and a water-soluble carboxylic acid 
amide. The pharmaceutical composition of this 
invention finds application as an antiulcer drug. Because of their gastric acid antisecretory and 
gastric mucosa-protective activities, certain benzimidazole 
compounds are gathering attention as therapeutic 
agents for ulcer and/or prophylactic agents for relapse 
of ulcer. To provide an intravenous dosage composition of 
the above compound, it has been proposed to subject a 
solution of omeprazole sodium in sterile water to 
filtration and lyophilization and reconstitute the 
lyophilizate extemporaneously in a filtration-sterilized 
mixture of injection-grade polyethylene 
glycol 400, sodium dihydrogen phosphate and sterile 
water (EP-A-124495). However, the stability of the active 
substance in the composition is not fully satisfactory. An injectable solution containing (a) 2-[(pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
compounds which 
are useful as anti-ulcer agents and (b) at least one 
solvent selected from the group consisting of ethanol, 
propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol was known (USP 
5,223,515). However, there is no previous reports of 
nicotinamide being used with the benzimidazole compounds 
for injectable solution. The main object of the present invention is to 
provide a highly stabilized pharmaceutical composition.  This object as well as other objects and advantages 
of the present invention will become apparent to those 
skilled in the art from the following description. The inventors of this invention explored into the 
above problems for years and discovered that the 
benzimidazole compound having antiulcer activity is highly 
soluble in an aqueous solution of an amide, such as 
nicotinamide or benzamide, and remains quite stable in 
such a solution and that a composition obtainable by 
dissolving the compound in such an aqueous amide solution 
and lyophilizing or spray-drying the solution shows no 
coloration with time and offers a long shelf-life as well 
as good water-reconstitutability. These findings were 
followed by their further research, which has brought this 
invention into being. According to this invention, there is provided a 
pharmaceutical composition which comprises a benzimidazole 
compound having antiulcer activity and a water-soluble 
carboxylic acid amide. According to one embodiment of the invention, the 
benzimidazole compound of the composition of the
