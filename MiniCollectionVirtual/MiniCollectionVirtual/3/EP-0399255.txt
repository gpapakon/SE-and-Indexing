<ABSTRACT>
A temperature switch assembly which includes a bimetal 
element (50) inserted into a holder body and secured in place by 

a mating shell (70) is presented. The holder body is constructed 
so that it may be screwed into existing bore holes of the 

vessel or engine. The bimetal element is formed with tangs 
on its base so that expansion and contraction effects due to 

temperature changes are compensated thus ensuring 
calibration of temperature switch over prolonged usage. The 

mating shell includes a switch contact (73). When the reaches a 
predetermined temperature, the bimetal element makes contact 

with the switch contact and completes the circuit. The 
circuit is connected to a warning device which is actuated 

when the circuit is completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bimetal temperature 
switches. In many applications it is crucial to know whether the 
temperature in a reactor, vessel or engine has exceeded a 
predetermined set point. When such an event occurs, an alarm 
should sound or some other action should occur. A simple 
yet effective way to accomplish this function is through the 
use of thermostatic bimetal strip. A thermostatic bimetal strip is defined as a composite 
material, made up of two or more metal strips fastened 
together. This composite, because of the different 
expansion rates of the component strips, tends to change 
curvature when subjected to a temperature change. With one end of the strip fixed, the other end deflects 
when subjected to a temperature change. The bimetal strip 
is positioned so that after it deflects a certain amount it 
makes contact with a lead and thereby completes a circuit. 
The point at which the circuit is completed corresponds to 
certain deflection of the bimetal strip and a certain 
temperature. This circuit is connected to a warning light, 
alarm annunciator or some other device to indicate that the 
temperature has been exceeded. Although devices using this principal are well known, 
there are problems that occur with known devices. Usually 
the bimetal strip is crimped into a copper temperature well. 
Because of this design, the bimetal element is subject to 
"shift" prior to use. The shift in the strip alters the 
high or low temperature signal that the device measures,  
 
thereby giving inaccurate readings. The shift can occur 
because the copper temperature well can deform slightly due 
to handling prior to installation. This shifts the position 
of the bimetal strip. Another problem of the known devices 
is that a separate hole into the vessel or engine needs to 
be provided to mount the copper temperature well. The 
present invention solves these problems in a unique and 
economical manner. The apparatus of the present invention includes a 
temperature sensing bimetal element which is dropped or 
inserted into place within an existing holder body. The 
holder body is part of the metal probe which screws into an 
existing threaded bore of the vessel or engine. A mating 
shell is screwed into threads of holder body which secures 
the bimetal element. Tangs on the base of the bimetal 
element compensate for expansion and contraction effects due 
to temperature changes within the vessel or engine. These 
tangs keep the bimetal strip from shifting, thus the 
temperature switch

of the probe securing the bimetal element in the 
indentation, wherein the mating shell has a switch contact 

projecting into an open space created by the indentation of 
the probe and the mating shell, the switch contact being 

electrically insulated from the mating shell; 
wherein the bimetal element deforms and makes 

contact with the switch contact when the temperature of the 
bimetal element reaches a predetermined value.
