<ABSTRACT>
A control mechanism (1) for an engine valve (29) comprising two rotatable cams (8, 10) which engage a lever (2) at two follower regions (23, 34) at different positions, the lever (2) having a zone of application (35) linked to the valve (29) whereby rocking movement of the lever (2) consequent on rotation of the cams (8, 10) causes opening and closing of the valve (29), wherein one of the two cams (8) is in constant engagement with the lever (2) and the other cam (10) is in periodic engagement with the lever (2), a gap (26) being provided between the other cam (10) and its respective follower region (23) when the other cam (10) is not in constant engagement with the lever (2), the width of the gap (26) affecting the duration of opening and closing of the valve (29) and its stroke length. Preferably, the zone of application (35) of the lever (2) is movable longitudinally along the lever (2) to thereby vary the stroke length of the valve (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve control mechanism for 
internal combustion engines. Reciprocating valves in internal combustion engines are 
typically actuated by a rotating cam operating a push rod, 
the push rod pressing a rocker arm thereby to depress the 
valve or alternatively in an overhead camshaft system a 
rotating camshaft over the engine block engages an 
intermediate portion of a rocker arm pivoted at one end, the 
other end depressing the valve. Thus the shape of the cam 
lobe serves to determine the duration and rate of opening and 
closing of the valve and the valve stroke length. A number of systems have been previously proposed, for 
instance in Australian Patent Application No. 82878/82, to 
provide a second rotating cam operating on a rocker arm which 
second cam can be actuated to provide further control over 
operation of an engine valve. Such systems, however, are 
quite limited in their application as only a small number of 
control parameters can be altered to affect operation of the 
valve. This limitation severely restricts the ability to 
make adjustments to the system when it is desired to optimise 
engine performance under different operating conditions. US-A-4,535,733 discloses with reference to Figures 7 and 
8 a control mechanism for an engine valve comprising first 
and second rotatable cams which engage a lever at two 
follower regions at different positions, the lever having a 
zone of application linked to the valve whereby rocking 
movement of the lever consequent on rotation of the cams 
causes opening and closing of the valve, and during part of 
the operational cycle of the valve the second cam is spaced 
by a gap which affects duration of valve opening and closure 
and stroke length, the operational cycle of said valve  
 
including an active period in which the valve is actuated and 
an inactive period during the full duration of which the 
valve is not actuated, The double cam arrangement of US-A-4,535,733 provides 
for selective low and high speed operation of the engine. In 
low speed operation only the first cam is engaged with the 
lever and for high speed operation a camshaft holder is 
displaced into an alternative configuration in which the 
second cam becomes active. In a double cam system of this 
type, at any one time only one of the two cams can function 
as the active cam except for a momentary transition from one 
cam to the other. The control mechanism of the present invention differs 
from the aforesaid system in that during the entirety of the

<CLAIMS>
A control mechanism for an engine valve comprising first 
and second rotatable cams (8,10) which engage a lever 

(2;98,106) at two follower regions (20,24) at different 
positions, the lever (2;98,106) having a zone of application 

linked to the valve (29) whereby rocking movement of the 
lever (2;98) consequent on rotation of the cams (8,10) causes 

opening and closing of the valve (29), and during part of the 
operational cycle of the valve (29) the second cam (10) is 

spaced by a gap (26) which affects duration of valve opening 
and closure and stroke length, the operational cycle of the 

valve (29) including an active period in which the valve (29) 
is actuated and an inactive period during the full duration 

of which the valve (29) is not actuated, characterised in 
that during the entirety of the active period of the valve 

(29) both cams (8,10) engage simultaneously with said lever 
(2;98,106) to cause opening and closing of the valve (29), 

and during the inactive period the first cam (8) is in 
continuous engagement with the lever (2;98,106) and the 

second cam (10) is spaced by the gap (26) from its respective 
follower region (24) on said lever (2;98,106). 
A control mechanism for an engine valve as claimed in 
claim 1, characterised in that the zone of application of the 

lever (2;98,106) is movable longitudinally along the lever 
(2;98) to thereby vary the stroke length of the valve (29). 
A control mechanism for an engine valve as claimed in 
claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the lever 

(2;98,106) is movable transversely with respect to the 
rotational axis of the cams (8,10) and is profiled so that 

the width of the gap (26) is varied upon such movement to 
thereby vary the timing of the valve (29). 
A control mechanism for an engine valve as claimed in 
any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the  

 
zone of application is linked to the valve (29) by means 

comprising a pushrod (42) intermediate the lever (2;98,106) 
and the valve (29) such that one end of the pushrod (42) 

engages the lever (2;98,106) at the zone of application of 
the lever, the arrangement being such that said one end of 

the pushrod (42) is movable along the lever (2;98,106) to 
thereby vary the valve stroke length. 
A control mechanism for an engine valve as claimed in 
claim 4, characterised by means for moving said one end of 

the pushrod (42) along the lever (2;98,106) and including a 
support (60) in which the pushrod (42) can reciprocate along 

its longitudinal axis, and means (62,65; 62,94) engaging the 
support (60) and operative to displace the support (60) in a 

direction substantially normal to the axis of the cams (8,10)

lever (2;98,106). 
A control mechanism for an engine valve as claimed in 
claim 4 or claim 5, characterised in that the zone of 

application lies on a curved surface (44,58;110) whereby 
movement of said one end of the pushrod (42) along the curved 

surface results in a non-linear change of the duration of
