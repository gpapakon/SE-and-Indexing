<ABSTRACT>
A method of making thermal printheads is provided which 
comprises the steps of: (a) preparing a master substrate (10) 

having plural rows of unit head regions; (b) forming a head glaze 
member (4) in each unit head region in each row so that an edge 

of the head glaze member (4) of the unit head region (9) aligned 
with that of the head glaze member of any other unit region in the 

same row; (c) half-cutting the master substrate (10) along the 
edge of the head glaze member (4) of the unit head region (9) with 

a half-cutting dicing blade which has an inclined edge face for 
partially cutting the head glaze member (4) to provide a glaze 

corner (11); and (d) forming an array of heating dots (8) along 
the glaze corner (11); wherein at least one blade positioning mark 

is formed on the master substrate (10) before the half-cutting 
step (c); and the half-cutting dicing blade is positionally set in 

the half-cutting step (c) by referring to the blade positioning

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making thermal
printheads. More specifically, the present invention relates to
a method of making thermal printheads of the type which comprise a
glaze corner for carrying an array of heating dots therealong.A thermal printhead of the above-described type is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 4(1992)-244861 for
example. Such a printhead may be incorporated in a heat sensitive
printer, thermal transfer printer, labelling printer, facsimile,
word processor, typewriter, card printer, image printer, time
recorder or the like.For the convenience of description, reference is now made to
Figs. 20 through 22 showing a prior art thermal printhead.The prior art printhead 3'' shown in Fig. 20 is a serial-type
printhead which comprises a head substrate 1'' and a printing
portion 2'' provided on the head substrate 1''. As shown in Fig.
21, the printing portion 2'' is provided at a head glaze strip 4''
formed on the head substrate 1'' adjacent to one longitudinal edge
thereof. The glaze strip 4'' is formed to have a corner 11 which
is relatively sharp for concentrating contact pressure relative
to an article (e.g. paper) being printed.As shown in Figs. 21 and 22, a patterned resistor layer 5'' is
formed on the head substrate 1'' and glaze strip 4'', whereas a
patterned conductor layer is formed on the resistor layer 5'' to
provide a common electrode 6'' and a plurality of individual 
electrodes 7''. The individual electrodes 7'' are spaced from the
common electrode 6'' at the corner 11'' of the glaze strip 4'', so
that the patterned resistor layer 5'' provides an array of heating
dots 8'' along the corner 11'' of the glaze strip 4''. Further, a
protective layer 24'' of glass for example is formed on the
patterned conductor layer 6'', 7''.The thermal printhead having the above structure may be
manufactured in the following manner.First, as shown in Fig. 23, a master substrate 10'' made of an
insulating material is prepared. The master substrate 10'' has
plural rows (e.g. three rows) of unit head regions 9'' which are
subsequently separated from each other by cutting. Apparently,
each of the unit head regions 9'' corresponds to a head substrate
(see the element 1'' in Fig. 20). Further, the master substrate
10'' is provided with a pair of positioning marks 14''.Then, as also shown in Fig. 23, head glaze strips 4'' are
formed on the master substrate 10'' in the respective unit head
regions 9'' adjacent to and along their corresponding longitudinal
edges.

(a) preparing a master substrate (10, 10') having
plural rows of unit head regions (9);
(b) forming a head glaze member (4, 4') in each
unit head region (9) in each row so that an edge of

the head glaze member (4, 4') of said each unit head
region (9) is aligned with that of the head glaze

member (4, 4') of any other unit region (9) in said
each row;
(c) half-cutting the master substrate (10, 10')
