<ABSTRACT>
Various forms of chemically modified collagen are covalently crosslinked with activated 
synthetic hydrophilic polymers to form optically clear biocompatible conjugates useful in a variety 

of medical applications, particularly in ophthalmic devices. The chemically modified collagen is in 
substantially nonfibrillar form at pH 7 and is preferably succinylated or methylated collagen. The 

synthetic hydrophilic polymer is preferably an activated polymeric glycol, most preferably, a di-or 
multifunctionally activated polyethylene glycol. Materials and devices formed with the chemically 

modified collagen-synthetic polymer conjugates have good optical clarity, mechanical strength, and 
moldability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biocompatible conjugates comprising chemically modified 
collagens, which are in substantially nonfibrillar form at pH 7, covalently bound to activated 
synthetic hydrophilic polymers, which conjugates are formulated to be optically clear and have 
superior mechanical strength compared to non-crosslinked formulations, which make them suitable 
for use in ophthalmic devices. Daniels et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,949,073, disclosed the preparation of soluble collagen by 
dissolving tissue in aqueous acid, followed by enzymatic digestion. The resulting atelopeptide 
collagen is soluble, and substantially less immunogenic than unmodified collagen. It may be 
injected into suitable locations of a subject with a fibril-formation promoter (described as a polymerization 
promoter in the patent) to form fibrous collagen implants in situ, for augmenting hard or 
soft tissue. This material is now commercially available from Collagen Corporation (Palo Alto, 
CA) under the trademark Zyderm® Collagen Implant. Miyata et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,164,559, disclosed an ophthalmic drug delivery system 
comprising a chemically modified collagen thin membrane carrier. While these materials are clear, 
they do not have the mechanical strength required for ophthalmic devices such as lenticules, which 
are intended for long-term in vivo use.  Luck et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,488,911, disclosed a method for preparing collagen in solution 
(CIS), wherein native collagen is extracted from animal tissue in dilute aqueous acid, followed by 
digestion with an enzyme such as pepsin, trypsin, or Pronase®, a trademark of American Hoechst 
Corporation, Somerville, NJ. The enzymatic digestion removes the telopeptide portions of the 
collagen molecules, providing "atelopeptide" collagen in solution. The atelopeptide CIS so produced 
is substantially nonimmunogenic, and is also substantially non-crosslinked 
due to loss of the 
primary crosslinking regions. The CIS may then be precipitated by dialysis in a moderate shear 
environment to produce collagen fibers which resemble native collagen fibers. The precipitated, 
reconstituted fibers may additionally be crosslinked using a chemical agent (for example, aldehydes 
such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde), heat, or radiation. The resulting products are suitable 
for use in medical implants due to their biocompatability and reduced immunogenicity. Wallace et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,208, disclosed an improved collagen formulation 
suitable for use in soft tissue augmentation.
