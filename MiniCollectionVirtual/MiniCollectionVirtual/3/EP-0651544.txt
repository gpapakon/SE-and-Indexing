<ABSTRACT>
A handheld, mobile personal communicator 10 has a user interface 
comprising a touchscreen display 28. The communicator 10 also has an 

editing function. In an editor mode, a first screen 150 is displayed 
containing a limited data entry area 152 and a full keyboard 156. By 

selecting a predetermined key, the screen is changed to second screen 160 
having an enlarged data display area and a collapsed keyboard having a 

single line of keys. The first screen 150 can be restored by selecting a 
predetermined key. The enlarged data display area 162 shows more lines 

of text and allows a user to readily select different portions of the 
document being edited.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of personal communicators having 
a variety of data processing and communications functions. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a collapsible keyboard for use 
with such a communicator. The invention was designed as part of a personal communicator that 
combines a cellular phone, a data and fax modem, and a data processing 
system, into a mobile, compact, lightweight, battery operated, handheld 
device having a variety of data processing and communication functions. 
These functions include operating the device as a standard cellular 
phone; a calendar showing a list of things to do at various times; an 
address book for organizing names, addresses and phone numbers; a 
calculator; a note pad allowing text entry and editing; and a 
communication device for fax, E-mail, and various data bases and 
services. The personal communicator is in the form of a handset having an 
earphone or speaker at one end, a microphone at the other end, and a 
small touchscreen display between the speaker and the microphone. The 
display has a touch or pressure sensitive overlay, and a fine pitch 
liquid crystal display (LCD) operated as a standard CGA display with a 
resolution of 640x200 pixels. The touchscreen display provides a graphic 
user interface, input/output device for a variety of functions or 
applications It is common in the field of desktop personal computers to provide 
separate keyboards and displays by means of which the entire area of a 
display can be used to view forms and documents that are being edited. 
In that way, the user is able to see a relatively large amount of 
information at a given time and is able to rapidly browse through the 
document a page at a time. Many screens display twenty five lines of 
text with eighty characters per line. However, this is impossible to do 
in a handheld device having only a small display area and no separate 
keyboard.  U.S. patent 5,184,314- E.J. Kelly et al discloses a "MOBILE DATA 
PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM WITH REMOVABLE PORTABLE COMPUTER" in 
which the portable computer has a touchscreen display of a size 
apparently greater than that of the personal communicator of the 
invention. A full keyboard can be simulated on the display along with a 
limited data entry area. The system also has an external keyboard 
converter having a cradle for receiving the portable computer. The 
keyboard converter also has an electromechanical full size keyboard. 
When the portable computer is placed in the cradle, the

<CLAIMS>
A personal communicator (10) comprising: 
   a casing (12) of a size adapted to be held in the hand of a user; 

   a touchscreen display (26) mounted on said casing, said touchscreen 
display forming a user interface for entering information into and 

outputting information from said communicator, said touchscreen display 
comprising a pressure sensitive overlay (28) coupled with a display 

device for displaying different screens of information; 
   processing means mounted in said casing, said processing means 

being connected to said touchscreen display for receiving information 
entered through said overlay and outputting information to said display 

device, said processing means comprising screen management means (80) for 
painting different screens on said display device including a first 

screen (150) and a second screen (160); 
   said first screen displaying a full qwerty keyboard (156) having a 

plurality of rows of alphameric keys, a collapsed data entry area (152), 
and a first set of selectively actuated function keys including a first 

key for initiating switching from said first screen to said second 
screen; 

   said second screen presenting an expanded data display area (162) 
and a collapsed keyboard having a single row of selectively actuated 

function keys including a second key for initiating switching from said 
second screen to said first screen, said expanded data display area being 

larger than said collapsed data entry area for displaying more 
information than is displayable in said data entry area; and 

   said processing means further comprising key selection detecting 
means for detecting actuation of said first key and said second key and 

operating said screen management means to switch between said first and 
second screens in response to actuation of said first and second keys. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein: 
   said casing (12) is elongated and has a speaker (22) mounted 

adjacent one end and a microphone (44) mounted adjacent another end; and
 

   said touchscreen display (26) has rectangular shape elongated in a 
direction similar to said casing, said display device being a liquid 

crystal display (LCD) on which said first (150) and second (160) screens 
are presented for viewing by the user. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 2 wherein said 
screen management means (80) selectively paints screens on said LCD in 

portrait and landscape orientations, said first (150) and second (160) 
screens having landscape orientations. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 2 wherein each key 
is selectable by a user first touching said overlay adjacent to such key 

and then releasing said overlay; and said processing means further 
comprises means operable in response to releasing said overlay to process 

such key so selected. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 4 wherein said 
processing means detects when said overlay is touched and highlights said 

such key to provide visual feedback to said user indicative of which key 
is to be selected upon releasing said overlay. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
data entry area of said first screen (150) contains a predetermined 

number of lines of information, and said data display area of said second 
screen (160) contains a larger number of lines of information. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 6 wherein said 
screen management means displays a cursor (154) in said data entry area 

indicating a point of next data entry, said screen management means is 
operative to insert a cursor into said data display area of said second 

screen (160) in response to said user selecting a line in said second 
screen by touching said overlay adjacent said line so selected. 
A personal communicator (10) as claimed in claim 7 wherein said 

screen management means is further operative in response to said key 
selection means detecting actuation of said second key, to display a 

first screen (150) that includes said line, and cursor therein, selected 
from said second screen (160).
