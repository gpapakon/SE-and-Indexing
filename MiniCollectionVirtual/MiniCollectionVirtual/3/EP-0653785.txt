<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric isolated type semiconductor device 
which can achieve a reduction in crystalline defects by 

means of a simple production process is provided. 
High-concentration regions (5, 6, and 7) are formed as 

active regions on a surface portion of an islandish 
semiconductor region (100) which is isolated from an 

adjacent semiconductor region (200) by means of an isolation 
trench (9a). According to a first aspect of the present 

invention, an N type crystalline defect suppression region 
(11) doped at a high concentration and deeper than the 

high-concentration regions (5, 6, and 7) is formed over the 
entire surface of an adjacent semiconductor region (200). 

According to a second aspect of the present invention, a 
high-concentration N type crystalline defect suppression 

region (110) is provided on a surface portion of a P type 
high-concentration region (50) is formed with identical 

structure and by an identical production process. By means 
of these N type regions (11, 110), crystalline defects are 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric
isolated type semiconductor device.Conventionally, an dielectric isolated type
semiconductor device having an island semiconductor
region the bottom of which is isolated from a semiconductor
substrate and the side of which is isolated from an adjacent
semiconductor region by means of an isolation trench, with
active elements such as transistors and diodes formed in
this island semiconductor region, has been widely
produced.In such a dielectric isolated type semiconductor
device, it is important to reduce crystalline defects in
order to improve the characteristics of the active elements
formed in the island semiconductor region, but
conventionally the addition of complex production processes
was required for this purpose. In particular, compression
stress on the surface of an island semiconductor region
in a dielectric isolated type semiconductor device is large
in comparison with a semiconductor device of PN junction
isolated type, and so crystalline defects easily occur. Further information relating to the prior art can be
found in the following documents.EP-A-0 628 996, which is comprised in the prior art in
accordance with Art. 54(3) EPC, describes a semiconductor
device comprising a semiconductor layer of a first
conductivity type formed over a substrate; an island-like
semiconductor region of a second conductivity type formed
from the surface of said semiconductor layer into the
inside thereof and higher in impurity concentration than
said semiconductor layer; a side dielectric isolation
region formed from the surface of said semiconductor layer
into the inside thereof and formed deeper than said island-like
semiconductor region and separates an element region
formed within said island-like semiconductor region from
the other semiconductor layer regions; and an adjacent
semiconductor region disposed in adjacency to said element
region with said side dielectric isolation region
therebetween; wherein a voltage that allows a depletion
layer between a semiconductor layer within said element
region and said island-like semiconductor region to reach
said side dielectric isolation region is applied to between
the semiconductor layer within said element region and said
island-like semiconductor region, and wherein said adjacent
semiconductor region has electric potential that is more
approximate to that at said island-like semiconductor
region rather than to that at said element region.EP-A-0 615 286, which is comprised in the prior art in
accordance with Art.
