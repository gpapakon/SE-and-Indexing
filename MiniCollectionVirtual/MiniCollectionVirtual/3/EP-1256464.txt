<ABSTRACT>
A caster for a baby carriage 25 is composed of a caster holder
30 mounted to a front leg 12 of a baby carriage 10; a caster column

provided at the caster holder 30 and having a flange shape portion
32a at its lower end, and the caster bearing member 36 slidably

and rotatably mounted to the caster column 32 and supporting a
front wheel 35 at one side. Tapered surfaces 32b, 36c that are

inclined toward the circumferential direction and engage each
other, are provided on a top surface 32c of the flange shape

portion 32a of the caster column 32 and a downward surface 32d
of the caster bearing member 36, respectively. A spring 37 is

provided between the caster holder 30 and the caster bearing

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a caster for a baby carriage and
more particularly to a caster for a front wheel of a baby carriage.Baby carriages are generally used to take out babies/children
to the outdoors for a walk, shopping, etc. Various baby carriages
to easily to fold up, store and carry, are proposed and put in
practical use.FIG. 11 is a perspective view of a baby carriage that can be
folded up as mentioned above. This baby carriage 10 comprises
a pair of left and right front legs 12 that have front wheels
11, a pair of left and right rear legs 14 that have rear wheels
13, a hand-pushing rod 15 that is bent to a nearly U-shape, a
pair of left and right arm rests 16, and a detachable guard arm
17 that is put over both arm rests 16 and 16. One end of each
arm rest 16 is fitted to a portion near the end of left and right
pipes 18 of the hand-pushing rod 15 and the top end of each front
leg 12 is fitted to the other end of each arm rest 16. The top
ends of the left and right rear legs 14 are also fitted to the
intermediate portions of the arm rests 16, respectively. One end
of a bracket 19 that is bent in a dog leg shape is fitted to the
intermediate portion of the rear leg 14. The ends of the left
and right pipes 18 of the hand-pushing rod 15 are fitted to the
intermediate position of the bracket 19. When the baby carriage
is unfolded, lock members 20 installed movably to the lower ends
of the pipes 18 engage with the engaging portions formed at the
other ends of the brackets 19 and the unfolded state is maintained.On the other hand, the left and right front legs 12 are
connected with a front side connecting bar 21, and the left and
right rear legs 14 are connected with a rear side connecting bar
22. Further, the front end of a connecting bar 23 is fitted to
the intermediate portion of the front legs 12 and the rear end
of this connecting bar 23 is fitted to the ends of the pipes 18
together with the brackets 19. Further, an upper side connecting
bar 24 is connected to the intermediate portions of the left and 
right connecting bars 23.As illustrated in FIG 11, when the locking members 20 provided
at the lower ends of the pipes 18 are engaged with the engaging
portions provided at the upper ends of the brackets 19, the baby
carriage is held in the usable unfolded state. On the other hand,
when the locking members 20 are disengaged from the brackets 19
by operating an operating device 25 provided at the hand-pushing
rod 15, the arm rests 16 and the connecting bars 23 become movable
upward from the pipes
