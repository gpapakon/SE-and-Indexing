<ABSTRACT>
A laundry washing machine comprises a cabinet (10) having 
side walls (13,14), top and bottom walls (15,16), a back piece 

(12) and a front piece (11). In the front piece (11) an opening 
(19) is provided for a door (18) arranged to close an opening 

in a tub, said tub with a drum, rotatably journalled in the 
tub, and a drive motor for the drum forming an assembly (17) 

which is free-swingingly suspended in the cabinet by means of 
spring means and vibration damping means such that an annular 

gap (36) is formed around the door (18) between the cabinet 
(10) and the tub. Sound damping means are provided for reducing 

noise which escapes from the machine and which is generated by 
the machine when operating. The sound damping means comprises 

a sound trap of the labyrinth type (20,21,22,23; 25,26,27,28) 
disposed in the annular gap (36) around the door (18). Preferably, 

the sound trap comprises a sound absorbent (31) disposed 
in a part of the sound trap facing the interior of the cabinet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laundry washing machines 
of the kind comprising a cabinet having side walls, top and 
bottom walls, a back piece and a front piece, wherein the front 
piece has an opening for a door provided for the closure of an 
opening in a tub, said tub together with a drum, rotatably 
journalled therein, and a drive motor, provided for rotating of 
said drum, forming an assembly which by means of spring means 
and vibration damping means is free-swingingly suspended in 
the cabinet such that adjacent to the front piece, between the 
cabinet and the tub an annular gap is formed which surrounds 
the door. In a laundry washing machine of the kind referred to above 
the assembly constitutes a free-swinging unit which is completely 
disconnected from the rest of the cabinet. In order to 
have access to the drum contained in the tub and supporting the 
laundry to be washed, in the usual way, a door is provided and 
in this type of machine the door is arranged to close directly 
an opening in the tub. In a machine of this type a corresponding 
opening is provided in the cabinet just in front of the 
door and adjacent to the opening the space between the front 
piece and the tub must be of sufficient size to permit the 
latter, when the machine is operating, to move without contacting 
the cabinet. Suitably, the distance amounts to a few 
centimeters and, at least, the distance should amount to 3 cm. In another common type of laundry washing machine the door 
is disposed on the front piece of the cabinet and the opening 
in the tub is connected to the opening in the front piece by 
means of an annular gasket, usually a flexible bellows made of 
rubber. In this embodiment no annular gap is present which, 
like in the embodiment described above, connects the interior 
of the machine to the surrounding atmosphere involving problems 
caused by escaping noise. For the purpose of reducing noise generated during the 
operation of the machine and present mainly in the range from 
a couple of hundred Hertz and up to about 3.000 Hertz it has 
been suggested that a sound absorbent be disposed on the inside 
of the cabinet. For example, a viscous elastic material can be 
used which is sprayed onto the interior walls of the cabinet,  
 
preferably the front piece and the side walls. Such a washing 
machine is described in the publication JP-A-63197495. Even when this techique is used in a washing machine of the 
kind referred to above noise can escape in a forward direction 
through the annular gap
