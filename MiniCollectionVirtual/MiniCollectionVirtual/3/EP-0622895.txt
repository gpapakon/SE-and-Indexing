<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus is small in a power consumption and suitable 
for use in a portable radio communication apparatus. The communication 

apparatus includes a semiconductor power amplifier integrated circuit (11) which 
uses a GaAs junction type FET having a gate bias terminal (17) to which a gate 

bias voltage is applied. The integrated circuit decreases its amount of power 
consumption in a manner that the integrated circuit is operated to perform an 

amplification operation during a communication operation and not operated when 
a communication is interrupted or a time slot is not allotted to the communication 

apparatus itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to communication apparatus and,
more particularly, is directed to a communication apparatus using a power amplifier
of a low-power consumption type.Recently, in the field of land mobile communications using mobile
telephones, portable telephones or the like, the present radio frequency band allocated
to the land mobile communications has become insufficient for radio communication
due to the increase of the number of subscribers. Then, it has been decided to start up
various new services for the land mobile communications. These new services are
common in that they are each performed by digital communication of the time-division
multiplex system using a quasi-microwave band of 0.8 GHz to 2 GHz.Terminal devices for such land mobile communications are indispensably
required to be miniaturized since portability is an important requirement.
Accordingly, the integration of electronic parts used in the device has become a most
important problem. Further, since the terminal device must necessarily be driven by a
battery, it is an important condition to decrease the power source current of the
device in order to extend the non-charging time period of the battery.Of the power source currents, the amount of current consumed by a power
amplifier integrated circuit at a transmission stage is quite larger when compared
with the consumed currents at the other portions of the terminal device. Therefore, it
has been an important problem to decrease the amount of the current consumed by
the power amplifier integrated circuit.The conventional mobile communication terminal device of such a type is
constructed as shown in Figure 1, for example. The apparatus shown in Figure 1 is an
example of the mobile communication terminal device which is used in the time-division
multiplex communication system.Referring to Figure 1, a relay 2 is connected between a power source
terminal of a power amplifier 4 and one electrode of a power source 3 the other
electrode of which is grounded at 5. Since the time-division multiplex system is
employed, the relay 2 intermittently makes and breaks the connection between the
power source 3 and the power amplifier 4 in accordance with a control signal from a
main controller 1. Therefore, the power amplifier 4 of the terminal device is operated
only during a time slot which is allotted to the terminal device itself, so that the
amount of power source current consumed by the power amplifier 4 is decreased. However, this conventional mobile communication
