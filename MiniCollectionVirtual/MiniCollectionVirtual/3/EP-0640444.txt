<ABSTRACT>
A compact, foldable wrench (10) having a head (12) for 
engaging a threaded fastener to be rotated, and a 

handle (16) pivotally attached to the head for use in a 
folded position substantially surrounding the head, 

or an open position projecting radially from the 
head. The head (12) may contain an opening to receive a 

fastener head (
e.g
., may be in the form of a box 
wrench), or alternatively, it may house a ratchet 

mechanism adapted to receive a drive socket or 
other fastener drive. In another embodiment, the 

head (12) may house a screw driver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to torque-applying tools, 
particularly including manually-operated ratchet 
wrenches and other devices for rotating threaded 
fasteners. Numerous tools adapted to rotatably drive 
threaded fasteners and workpieces, such as screws, 
bolts, nuts and the like, have been developed in 
the past. These prior tools include common 
screwdrivers, wrenches, nut drivers, adjustable 
wrenches, socket wrenches, and ratchet wrenches, to 
name a few. Particularly important among them are 
ratchet wrenches, which include a typical square 
cross-section drive post connected to a ratchet 
mechanism carried within a housing which may be 
hemispherically shaped to form a handle, or from 
which a handle with, typically, a generally 
cylindrical or rectangular cross-section may 
project radially. A socket selected from a socket 
set having various socket openings sized to receive 
differently dimensioned bolt heads or nuts is then 
removably secured on the drive post. Small, hand-held wrenches exist which may be 
used to tighten or loosen a workpiece. Some such 
wrenches are even small enough to be carried in a 
user's pocket. However, due to the relatively 
small size, the user often cannot apply sufficient 
torque, since no lever arm or handle is formed on 
the wrench to get mechanical advantage.  
 GB-A-802,015 discloses a so-called "plug spanner" having a handle 
pivotable between a first, closed position and a second, open position. In 
the open position of the handle the spanner is capable of engaging a 
vehicle spark plug, but in its closed position the handle retains the spark 
plug within the spanner. The spanner of GB-A-802,015 thus is not 
useable as a wrench when the handle occupies its closed position.  
 Accordingly, there remains a need for a small, 
hand-held tool, particularly one that can be 
carried in a user's pocket, which may be used to 
quickly tighten or loosen a fastener or other  
 
workpiece, but also provide sufficient torque to 
loosen or tighten a workpiece when the operation 
requires additional mechanical advantage.  
 According to the invention there is provided a tool for applying torque 
to a workpiece, comprising: 
a) a head for engaging a workpiece; b) a pivot; and c) a handle connected to the head by the pivot and moveable 
between an open position of the tool in which the handle extends radially away from the head and a 
folded position of the tool in which the handle substantially surrounds the head, characterised in that the 
head is engageable with

<CLAIMS>
A tool (10) for applying torque to a workpiece, comprising: 

a) a head (12) for engaging a workpiece; 
b) a pivot (14); and 
c) a handle (16) connected to the head (12) by the pivot (14) 
and moveable between an open position of the tool in which the handle extends radially away from the 

head and a folded position of the tool in which the handle substantially surrounds the head,
 
characterised in that the head (12) is engageable with and disengageable 

from a workpiece in both the open and folded positions of the tool (10). 
The tool of claim 1, further comprising a 
ratchet mechanism (18) in the head (12). 
The tool of claim 2, wherein the ratchet 
mechanism (18) further comprises a square drive post (30). 
The tool of any of claims 1-3, wherein the tool (10) is 
made of materials selected from the group 

consisting of metal and plastic. 
The tool of any of claims 1-4, wherein the handle (16) is 
in the shape of an annulus. 
The tool of any of claims 1-5, wherein the handle (16) is 
of a size sufficient to fit comfortably in a 

typical user's hand. 
The tool of any of claims 1-6, wherein the head (12) has a 
flange (28) on one end through which the pivot (14) runs. 
The tool of claim 2 or 3, wherein the ratchet 
mechanism (18) is a double pawl, center shift mechanism (26). 
The tool of claim 8, wherein the handle (16) 
contains an aperture (22) permitting switching of the 

ratchet mechanism (18) while the head is in the folded position of the tool. 
The tool of any of claims 2, 3, 8 and 9 wherein the ratchet 
mechanism (18) is held in place with a threaded keeper (19). 
The tool of any of claims 1-10, wherein the pivot (14) 
permits the pivoting of the head (12) between  

 
approximately one-hundred and eighty 

(180) degrees with respect to the plane of the handle (16). 
The tool of claim 11, wherein the handle (16) 
stops the pivoting of the head at the folded position and at the open position. 
The tool of claim 11 or 12, wherein the handle (16) 
further comprises a shelf (25) that stops pivoting 

of the head (12) at approximately zero (0) degrees with respect to 
the plane of the handle (16). 
The tool of any of claims 1-13, wherein the handle (16) 
contains indentations (20) to increase the friction with 

the user's hand and reduce slippage. 
The tool of any of claims 1-14, wherein the handle (16)

folded position of the tool. 
The tool of claim 15, wherein the means to

surrounding the head (12) when the tool is in the 

folded position; 
(ii) support means (32), against which the head (12)

position, for allowing substantial 
force to be exerted upon the head when 

it engages the workpiece while the tool is in the 
folded position; and 
(iii) restraining means (28) for preventing the 
head from rotating about the pivot 

beyond the open position. 
The tool of claim 18, further 
comprising a screwdriver attached to the head (12).
