<ABSTRACT>
A control method and architecture is described for an ATM network carrying
connectionless data traffic. The method is capable of integrating connection-oriented

as well as connectionless traffic. The method takes advantage of the
quasi-deterministic nature of the traffic emanating from a source that is being

shaped by the leaky bucket shaping algorithm. Alternative methods are provided
if such a shaping algorithm is not provided by the CPE which methods still guarantee

performance that equals or exceeds shared media networks such as FDDI.
Hardware and software embodiments of the methods are disclosed. The invention

is particularly applicable to LANs and hubs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control architecture for asynchronous transfer 
mode (ATM) networks, and specifically relates to a burst-level control for 
controlling access in an ATM network. While the following description describes the invention in conjunction with a 
LAN, the invention is not so limited and is applicable to any ATM network. There is tremendous interest in the development of ATM based LANs that 
provide connectivity between local work-stations and servers and are also suitable 
for use as a hub. Current LAN technologies have media access control which ensures that once 
a station gains access to the medium, no frame loss results (except due to random 
noise). Many ATM-based switch architectures, on the other hand, do not have 
such control. Moreover, because of the limited amount of high speed memory that 
is provided in a switch, it is possible for there to be significant cell loss, especially 
when there is hot spot traffic from several bursty sources all directed to a single 
output port. For example, such a condition occurs in a client server model. The 
resulting cell loss leads to large frame loss when compared to systems having 
media access control. Therefore, it is essential that during periods of overload the 
bandwidth at a hot-spot output port be shared in a manner similar to that in a 
shared medium network. A solution to implementing media access control and shared bandwidth at 
a hot-spot output port is to institute a burst-level control that manages media 
access in an ATM LAN. Burst level control is preferable in an ATM LAN when 
the following conditions are met: sources generate large bursts (compared to the 
amount of buffer memory in the switch) that will result in buffer overflows in 
the absence of any control; blocking a burst at the beginning of the burst is 
preferable to having retransmissions of bursts already in progress and frequent 
retransmissions due to cell loss increases the effective load on the system, resulting 
in an end-to-end throughput that is several times slower than that of a shared 
medium network. However, it is important that the burst level control be done in real time so 
that the latencies in admitting new bursts do not become a significant bottleneck. The present invention describes a burst level control method and apparatus  
 
for use in an ATM LAN. The burst level provides both a media access control and 
a fast and efficient call admission control. By using such a burst level control, not only can ATM LAN performance be 
compa
