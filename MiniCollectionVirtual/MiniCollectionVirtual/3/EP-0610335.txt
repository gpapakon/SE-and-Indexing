<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides peptides having T cell stimulating activity termed recombitope peptides. Recombitope peptides of the invention preferably comprise at least two T cell epitopes derived from the same or from different protein antigens, and preferably comprise at least two regions, each region preferably having human T cell stimulating activity and each region comprising at least one T cell epitope derived from a protein antigen. Recombitope peptides of the invention can be derived from protein allergens, autoantigens, or other protein antigens. The invention also provides methods of diagnosing sensitivity to a protein allergen or other protein antigen in an individual, methods to treat such sensitivity and therapeutic compositions comprising one or more recombitope peptides. The invention further provides methods for designing recombitope peptides of the invention where the protein antigen to which the individual is sensitive has unknown or ill-defined T cell epitopes.

<DESCRIPTION>
T lymphocytes can mediate and regulate both the specific and non-specific effector mechanisms of immune responses. CD4+ T lymphocytes provide help for antibody production and secrete cytokines which modulate the growth of other T cells and the growth and differentiation of other immune cells such as monocytes and granulocytes. Functional and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the generation of cellular immune responses depends upon antigen receptors on T cells that recognize peptide fragments of foreign proteins associated with products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that are expressed on antigen-presenting accessory cells. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to culture efficiently antigen-specific human and mouse T cell lines and clones invitro. In addition, it is now possible to produce large amounts of protein antigens or their fragments using recombinant DNA technology or solid phase peptide synthesis. Thus, in the last few years, several research groups have begun to determine the linear amino acid sequences of antigenic proteins that are recognized by T cells in association with MHC (T cell epitopes).Peptides derived from a variety of protein antigens, including bacterial and viral pathogens, autoantigens, allergens and other experimental antigens such as hen egg lysozyme (HEL), ovalbumin (OVA) and lambda repressor (cl) have been examined for the ability to stimulate antigen-specific T cells. A wide size spectrum of peptides has been reported to serve as T cell epitopes. For example. OVA amino acid residues 324-339 (Shimonkevitz, R. et al., J. Immunol., 133:2167 (1984)), HEL amino acid residues 74-96 (Shastri, N. et al., J. Exp. Med. 164:882-896 (1986); and lambda repressor (cl) amino acid residues 12-26 (Lai, M.-Z et al., J. Immunol., 139:3973-3980 (1987)) have been demonstrated to trigger efficiently whole protein-primed T cells. A peptide derived from Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg amino acid residues 19-33) has recently been shown to stimulate T cell responses in a majority of human subjects who had been immunized with a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Schad, V.C. et al., Seminars in Immunol. 3:217-224 (1991)). A major mycobacterial antigen 65-kD protein has also been epitope-mapped (Lamb, J.R. et al., EMBO J., 6(5):1245-1249 (1987)). T cell epitopes have been identified in the peptides comprised of amino acid residues 112-132 and 437-459 of the 65-kD protein.
