<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the
technical field concerning automatic supervision
and security devices, that can be attached to
transport means in general and to motor vehicles in
particular.More precisely, the present invention is
concerned with a motor vehicle antitheft system
integrated with functions of security, localisation
and navigation of the same motor vehicle.Nowadays, there are many types of antitheft
systems for motor vehicles, but generally they can
be subdivided in two categories: the antitheft
systems acting in a limited range and the antitheft
systems acting in a wider range.The first group includes antitheft systems
which signal automatically tampering or anomalous
use of the motor vehicle in a limited environment
surrounding the same motor vehicle.In other words, these antitheft systems,
attached to motor vehicles, signal either acoustically
or visually fraudulent use of motor vehicles
by persons considered "unauthorised", because they
have not deactivated the same antitheft system.The main disadvantage of this type of antitheft
systems results just from their peculiar
characteristic, i.e. their limited range of action,
of dozens or hundreds metres, either for signalling
the tampering into the vehicle or the activation or
deactivation of the same antitheft system.Another disadvantage of this type of antitheft
systems is that, in order to function, they must be
first activated by an "authorised" person. The other group of antitheft system comprises
the antitheft system for motor vehicle that signal
"unauthorised" tampering of the motor vehicle up to
a distance of some kilometres from the same motor
vehicle.Such antitheft system are provided with a
transmitter-receiver unit on radio frequency that
can produce and transmit an alarm signal that can
be received and recognised by an operative station,
on the same radio frequency and designed to distant
monitoring of possible thefts of the load stored in
the motor vehicle or its part, or theft of the same
motor vehicle.Such alarm signal is transmitted by the
antitheft system set up on the vehicle only if
preestablished conditions for recognising the theft
occur.The most common conditions that activate the
antitheft system for motor vehicle are first of all
subjected to the previous voluntary activation by
the motor vehicle driver's by means of a special
key either mechanical or electronic (remote control
key, magnetic card, and the like).Most often the antitheft system is activated
when one of the motor vehicle doors is opened or
when
