<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic compositions containing corneocyte 
proteins or polypeptides in a cosmetically acceptable 

vehicle can be used to form a protective layer on skin, 

hair or nails. The proteins may be crosslinked, 
thereby forming a protective layer which mimicks the 

corneal layer of natural skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The epidermis is a stratified epithelium consisting 
of numerous cell layers. The principal cell type of 
the epidermis is the keratinocyte. Keratinocytes are 
responsible for the resistance of the skin to physical 
and chemical injury and for its impermeability to 
water. These functions are carried out primarily by 
the outermost layer of keratinocytes, termed 
"corneocytes," which have undergone programmed cell 
death. Corneocytes consist of a skeletal framework of 
keratin filaments surrounded by a special envelope that 
is found in no other cells within the body. This 
envelope consists of proteins ("corneocyte proteins") 
stabilized by inter-molecular isopeptide bonds (Rice 
and Green (1977), Cell, 11:417-422). The bonds are 
introduced by an enzyme, calcium-activated keratinocyte 
transglutaminase (Rice and Green (1979), Cell, 18:681-694). 
As skin ages, the epidermis atrophies with 
accompanying diminution of its physical resistance. The basal layer of the epidermis contains 
proliferating keratinocytes. When keratinocytes leave 
the basal layer, they begin to undergo terminal 
differentiation. When they reach the granular layer, 
the concentration of calcium ions inside the 
keratinocytes rises, resulting in activation of 
transglutaminase. The envelope precursor proteins, 
which at this stage are located just beneath the plasma 
membrane, are crosslinked by transglutaminase (Rice and 
Green (1979), ibid.; Greenberg et al. (1991) FASEB,  
 
5:3071-3077) and the resulting envelope becomes 
thoroughly insoluble, even in the presence of 
detergents and reducing agents (Green (1977), Cell, 
11:405-416; Hohl (1990), Dermatologica, 180:201-211). 
This envelope is the most resistant structure of the 
skin since keratin filaments, even though they are 
stabilized by disulfide bonds, can be dissolved by a 
combination of detergent and reducing agent. 
Transglutaminase and its crosslinked products are also 
present in hair and nails (Rice et al., Keratinocyte 
Handbook, (in press)).  
 EP-A-0 511 116 discloses the preparation of antigenic compositions from 
mammalian epithelium extracts or from human filaggrin or profilaggrin, the 
preparation of the antibodies directed against these antigenic compositions, and the 
use of these antigenic compositions for detection of a disease (rheumatoid
