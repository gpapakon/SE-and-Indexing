<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an arrangement for connecting in each case two pipe portions (1, 2) of the ceramic inner pipe of a chimney to one another or the lateral attachment stub for a discharge door on an associated pipe portion, the two parts (1, 2) which are to be connected to one another are pressed against one another by means of a flexible bracing device (7), under prestressing (12) and with flexible sealing (9, 10, 13), and thus fastened on one another.

<CLAIMS>
Connection of two pipe sections (1, 2) of the 
ceramic inner pipe of a chimney in which the end 

surfaces, which are directed towards one another, of the 
two pipe sections (1, 2) are cut off, preferably with 

parallel faces, and formed on each pipe section (1; 2) at 
an axial spacing from each of its end surfaces is an 

external groove (10; 11), in which retaining elements (8; 
9) engage in a form-locking manner, which project 

radially inwardly on a connecting collar (7) which 
overlaps the end regions of the two pipe sections (1; 2) 

externally, characterised in that the connecting collar 
(7) comprises elastomeric material and is constructed as 

an annularly closed, encircling, elastic clamping device 
which is disposed, radially enlarged and axially 

stretched, on the end regions of the two pipe sections 
(1, 2) and presses them axially together with a biassing 

force, the retaining elements engaging in the external 
grooves (10, 11) in the pipe sections (1, 2) being 

constructed in the form of moulded beads (8, 9) moulded 
onto the internal periphery of the connecting collar (7) 

and annularly encircling clamping springs (12) being 
provided on the outer side of the connecting collar (7), 

corresponding to the axial position of the moulded beads 
(8, 9). 
Connection as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that provided at the connection point of the pipe 

sections (2) to be connected and extending along it there 
is an elastic seal (13) which is constructed as an 

encircling, annular sealing strip (13), which projects 
radially inwardly and is moulded integrally onto the  

 
internal periphery of the connecting collar (7). 
Connection as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that the sealing strip (13) is lip-shaped in cross-section. 
Connection as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that the sealing strip is of substantially triangular 

shape cross-section. 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the annular, encircling clamping 

springs (12) are at least partially embedded in the 
connecting collar (7). 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that associated with each end region of 

the pipe sections (1, 2) on the internal periphery of the 
connecting collar (7) there is a respective annular, 

encircling sealing bead (18; 19; 20), formed integrally 
with the connecting collar (7), which engages the 

external surface of the associated pipe section (2) 
whilst elastically deformed. 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the moulded beads (8, 9) are of 

circular segmental or trapezoidal shape in cross-section. 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the clamping springs (12) comprise 

stainless steel. 
Connection as claimed in Claim 7 or 8, characterised 
in that spiral springs are used as the clamping springs  

 
(12). 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the connecting collar (7) comprises 

fluoroelastomeric material. 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the clamping springs (12) are 

covered externally with an elastic protective layer (21). 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the connecting collar (7) is 

provided on its external periphery, at least partially, 
with an elastic protective layer (21). 
Connection as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the clamping springs (12) are 

connected together by connecting elements (25), 
preferably at least three connecting elements. 
Connection as claimed in Claim 13, characterised in 
that the connecting elements are constructed as metallic 

strips (25), preferably of stainless steel, which are 
firmly attached at one end to a clamping spring (12) and 

engageable at the other end in the other clamping spring 
(12).
