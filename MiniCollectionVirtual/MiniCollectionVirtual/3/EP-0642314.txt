<ABSTRACT>
A self standing supporting structure (28) and method for use in providing sleeping and/or resting accommodations in a limited space area such as in a college dormitory, a medical institution, a prison and in other areas. The structure is designed to support at least one bed and/or other accommodation device (40, 42) in at least two positions, one position being a "non-use" position and the other position being a "use" position. The bed and/or other accommodation devices (40) are pivotally mounted on the supporting structure and are retained in the desired position by at least one retaining device (44). The structure may also be constructed with adjustable feature (140, 142) to make the width of the device shorter as desired to facilitate the cleaning and/or painting of walls in the space area adjacent to the device. Also disclosed is a novel safety lock retainer device (46) for retaining the bed in a horizontal position and a novel method for providing sleeping and/or resting accommodations in a limited space using the applicant's supporting structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SELF STANDING SUPPORT STRUCTURE AND METHOD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to a device for providing additional sleeping and or resting accommodations such as a bed in a limited space area and in particular relates to a new and novel self-standing supporting structure having novel features that permit the accommodation to be retracted when not in use to thereby provide maximum room space in the area.In college and university dormitories, the space area assigned to a student in the dormitory is usually very limited. For example, a typical dormitory space allocated to sleeping accommodations may be as small as 8 feet by 12 feet. Since a college student may want to have a bed, a couch, a chair, a refrigerator and other items in the limited dormitory space area, the extremely cramped space can present problems. In many penal institutions and hospitals, a problem can occur in providing overflow sleeping and/or resting accommodations for the inhabitants of the building during critical times of emergencies when limited beds are available. In a similar manner, during weather emergencies, towns and communities are often required to provide temporary sleeping accommodations in school gymnasiums and other areas for lengthy periods of time. These emergency situations may have to continue until the town can recover from the emergency and the occupants can get back to their homes which sometimes may have to be rebuilt.Prior art devices of the type conceived by the applicants' are not known to be available to solve the problems of providing 

temporary sleeping and or resting accommodations in limited space areas such as the before mentioned dormitories, penal institutions, hospitals and other places where quick and temporary solutions are desired. It is always possible to hang beds from the walls or the ceilings of an area using brackets attached to the walls and ceilings. But the use of attached brackets for hanging the temporary sleeping accommodations is not desirable in most cases. Since the wall and ceiling bracket attachment would have to be removed after the temporary overcrowding or emergency condition had ended, the removal of the attachments may often require extensive patching of the walls and ceiling where the brackets were fastened. The initial set-up and after removal costs of restoring the area can be costly and such solution does not appear to be a viable alternative to the applicant's solution to the problem as will be shown hereafter.The use of permanent bunk bed frames

1. A self-standing supporting structure for use in providing sleeping and/or resting accommodations in a limited and/or unlimited space area such as in an educational institution, a medical institution, a prison, homes, summer camps, hotels, religious camps, disaster shelters, sport camps and in various other areas where sleeping and/or resting accommodations are desired without permanently attaching supporting structural devices to the walls, to the ceiling or to the floor of the space area, the supporting structure standing on the floor of the space area and being easily moveable as desired to different locations, comprising: (a) a free-standing frame support structure, spanning at least a portion of the space area and having at least three downwardly extending legs formed on the frame support structure, with the legs resting on the floor of the space area; (b) at least one accommodation device pivotally mounted on two of the downwardly positioned legs so that the accommodation device may be positioned in a "use" position and may also be positioned in a "non-use" position when desired; and (c) at least one retaining means, attached to the accommodation device for retaining the accommodation device in a "use" position for use by the occupant of the space area; the retaining means serving to support the entire weight of a plurality of occupants that may sit or lie on the accommodation device. 


2. The supporting structure as defined in claim 1 wherein the retaining means comprise at least one chain attached to the accommodation device and to the supporting structure and the chain is used to retain the accommodation device in a "non-use" position.
3. The supporting structure as defined in claim 1 wherein the retaining means comprise at least one safety lock pivotally attached to the downwardly extending legs and fixedly attached to the accommodation device.
4. The supporting structure as defined in claim 1 wherein the retaining means comprise at least one chain and at least one safety lock attached to the accommodation device and to the supporting structure and the chain is used to hold the accommodation device in a "non-use" position.
5. The supporting structure as defined in claim 4 wherein the retaining means comprise a pair of chains and a pair of safety locks attached to the accommodation device and to the supporting structure.
6. The supporting structure as defined in claim 1 wherein the structure has attached thereto at least two bed frames pivotally attached to the dowwnwardly extending legs. 


7. The supporting structure as defined in claim 1 wherein the structure has at least four bed frames pivotally attached to the downwardly extending legs .
8. The supporting structure as defined in claim 1 wherein the structure has at least six bed frames pivotally attached to the downwardly extending legs .
9. A self-standing supporting structure for use in providing sleeping and/or resting accommodations in a limited or/unlimited space area such as in an educational institution, a medical institution, a prison, homes, summer camps, hotels, religious camps, disaster shelters, sport camps and in various other areas where sleeping and/or resting accommodations are desired without permanently attaching structural devices to walls of the space area, the supporting structure standing on the floor of the spac area and being moveable as desired to different locations, comprising: (a) a free-standing frame structure, spanning at least a portion of the space area and having four downwardly extending legs attached to the frame structure and resting on the floor of the space area, the frame structure also having at least two cross supports sized to span across the width of the space area; (b) at least one bed frame, pivotally mounted on two of th downwardly legs so that the bed frame may be positioned horizontally when in a "use" position and may also be pivoted
