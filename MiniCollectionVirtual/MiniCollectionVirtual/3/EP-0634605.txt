<ABSTRACT>
Reflector made of plastic, intended more particularly for a vehicle lighting or signalling device. The reflector is produced by moulding, preferably by injection moulding of a mixture based on a heat-curable resin of crosslinkable epoxy type in the presence of a curing agent. The epoxy resin includes granular fillers consisting of wollastonite and, advantageously, of a mixture of quartz and kaolin.

<CLAIMS>
Plastic reflector, particularly intended for a vehicle lighting or indicator device, 
characterised in that it is produced by moulding, preferably by injection, a mixture 

based on a thermosetting resin of the cross-linkable epoxy type, in the presence of 
a hardener. 
Reflector according to Claim 1, characterised in that the epoxy resin has on 
average more than one epoxy group per molecule. 
Reflector according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the said epoxy resin 
comprises granular fillers consisting of wollastonite. 
Reflector according to Claim 3, characterised in that the said resin comprises 
granular fillers consisting of a mixture of quartz and kaolin. 
Reflector according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the wollastonite has a 
mean particle size below 100 Tm. 
Reflector according to Claim 5, characterised in that the wollastonite has a mean 
particle size below 50 Tm. 
Reflector according to Claim 6, characterised in that the wollastonite has a mean 
particle size below 5 Tm. 
Reflector according to one of Claims 4 to 5, characterised in that the particle size 
of the quartz/kaolin mixture is below 100 Tm. 
Reflector according to Claim 8, characterised in that the particle size of the 
quartz/kaolin mixture is below 50 Tm.  

 
Reflector according to Claim 9, characterised in that the particle size of the 
quartz/kaolin mixture is below 5 Tm. 
Reflector according to any one of Claims 3 to 10, characterised in that the 
proportion of wollastonite is between 10 and 350 particles by weight in relation to 

100 parts by weight of the total epoxy resin and hardener. 
Reflector according to any one of Claims 4 to 11, characterised in that the 
portion of quartz/kaolin mixture is between 10 and 350 parts by weight in relation to 

100 parts by weight of total epoxy resin and hardener. 
Reflector according to any one of Claims 4 to 12, characterised in that the 
quartz/kaolin mixture is composed of 5 to 95% by weight quartz and 95 to 5% 

kaolinite. 
Reflector according to Claim 13, characterised in that the quartz/kaolin mixture 
is composed of 20 to 80% by weight quartz and 80 to 20% kaolinite. 
Reflector according to any one of Claims 4 to 14, characterised in that the total 
fillers consisting of the wollastonite and quartz/kaolin mixture is less than 360 parts 

by weight. 
Reflector according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the epoxy resin does not include any fibrous reinforcement.
