<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the rate of coke formation during the 
industrial pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, the interior surface of 

a reactor is coated with a thin layer of a ceramic material, 
the layer being deposited by thermal decomposition of a non-oxygen 

containing silicon-nitrogen precursor in the vapor 
phase, in an inert or reducing gas atmosphere in order to 

minimize the formation of oxide ceramics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the thermal
decomposition of compounds in contact with a metal or metal
oxide surface to form a ceramic coating on the surface. In
particular, the ceramic coating may be formed on a heat-resistance
alloy steel or alloy steel oxide reactor for use in
chemical processes. The process of the invention provides an
improved chemical reactor processing environment for pyrolysis
processes such as cracking or the disproportionation of
hydrocarbons.Coking is a significant problem in high-temperature
chemical reactions, such as the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons,
particularly in the production of ethylene.Ethylene, the lightest olefinic hydrocarbon, is the most
important building block of the petrochemical industry.
Ethylene is produced almost exclusively via the pyrolysis of 
hydrocarbons in tubular reactor coils which are externally
heated by a furnace (see: Chapter 8 in Pyrolysis of
Hydrocarbons, p.109-142, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York (1980)).
High selectivity toward the production of desired olefins
(i.e., ethylene and propylene) and diolefins (i.e., butadiene)
with minimum methane and hydrogen production and coking in the
coils leading to longer heater runs are desired. This is
achieved by operating the pyrolysis heaters at high
temperatures (750-900°C), short residence times (0.1-0.6 sec.)
and low hydrocarbon partial pressures. Steam is added to the
feedstock to reduce the hydrocarbon partial pressure and the
amount of carbon deposited on the tube walls.Steamless cracking has been investigated as a potential
means of increasing production capacity and maximizing energy
efficiencies (see "Steamless Pyrolysis of Ethane to Ethylene",
Paper 101, presented at a meeting of the American Chemical
Society, Boston, Mass., April 1990, by Y. Song, A. A. Leff, W.
R. Kliewer and J. E. Metcalf). The work cited above was
performed in a tube made entirely of silicon carbide. The use
of tubes constructed of silicon carbide, however, would not be
possible on an industrial scale because of the low mechanical
reliability and fabrication problems of this material.Tubular reactor coils, also known as pyrolysis heaters,
are an important facet of operation to consider partly because
of coke deposition (see: Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical
Technology, Vol. 9, "Ethylene", J. Wiley & Sons Inc., New York 
(1979)). The mechanism of coke formation has been postulated
(see L. F. Albright & J. C. Marck, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., vol
27, 731 and 743 (1988)), but has yet to be modeled in precise
terms.The
