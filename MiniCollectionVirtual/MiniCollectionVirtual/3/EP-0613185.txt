<ABSTRACT>
An infrared imaging device has a plurality of 
detectors comprising thermocouples, bolometers, or the 

like and a scanner for scanning the detectors. To 
prevent all pixels corresponding to the detectors from 

failing to operate due to a charge overflow that occurs 
when some of the detectors are broken, a bypass circuit 

in the form of a bypass resistor, and a diode, or the 
like, is connected parallel to each of the detectors 

for limiting the output signal therefrom to a predetermined 
voltage range. Even if a detector is broken, the 

output signal thereof is limited to the predetermined 
voltage range, thus preventing a charge overflow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infrared 
imaging device and an infrared imaging system using 
such an infrared imaging device, and more particularly 
to an infrared imaging device which includes a detector 
comprising a thermocouple, a bolometer, or the like and 
a scanner comprising a charge-coupled device (CCD) or 
the like, and an infrared imaging system for outputting 
an image signal which is detected by such an infrared 
imaging device. As shown in Fig. 1(a) of the accompanying 
drawings, a conventional thermal infrared imaging 
device includes both a detector comprising a thermocouple 
composed of a P-type polysilicon layer 208, a hot 
contact 209, and an N-type polysilicon layer 210, and a 
scanner comprising a CCD composed of an N-type well 202 
and a CCD electrode 203 and a readout gate 204 and a 
source 205 for supplying a current to the CCD in response 
to a signal from the detector. The scanner is 
fabricated in a P-type semiconductor substrate 201 with 
an oxide film 206 deposited thereon by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD), the oxide film 206 having a cavity  
 
211 defined therein. The thermocouple is deposited on 
the oxide film 206 across the cavity 211. The cavity 
211 is produced by forming a polysilicon layer (sacrificial 
layer) in the oxide film 206 where the cavity 
211 is to be defined, and then etching away the polysilicon 
layer. The detector and the scanner are arranged 
in the vertical columns and horizontal rows of a 
two-dimensional pattern as an infrared imaging device 
as shown in Fig. 1(b). The infrared imaging device shown in Figs. 
1(a) and 1(b) operates as follows: A certain bias 
voltage VB is applied to a bias voltage terminal 213 to 
operate readout transistors 215, which are each composed 
of a readout gate 204 and the source 205, in a 
suitable fashion. Infrared radiation applied from 
above in Fig. 1(a) is absorbed by a pellet surface, 
making the temperature of a thin-film area, i.e., the 
hot contact 209, above the cavity 211 higher than the 
temperature of the other area. A bias voltage line 207 
and a contact 212 correspond to a cold contact of the 
thermocouple, and are positioned outside the thin film. 
Therefore, any heat applied to the bias voltage line 
207 and the contact 212 is transferred to the substrate, 
resulting in substantially no temperature rise 
at the bias voltage line 207 and the contact 212. Because of the difference between the temperatures  
 
at the hot and cold contacts, an electromotive 
force is generated due to the Seebeck
