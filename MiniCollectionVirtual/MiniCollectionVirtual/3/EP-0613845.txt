<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a vertical movement control device for 
a paper feed table device which allows a favorable 

paper feeding action to be carried out at an 
appropriate paper feed pressure for all kinds of paper 

without involving any failure to properly lift the 
paper feed table or any occurrence of seizure of the 

electric motor, and eliminates any unduly long waiting 
period even when the required lift of the paper feed 

table is relatively great due to addition of new paper 
or removal of paper jamming. The vertical movement 

control device an upper limit sensor 19 for detecting 
if the upper surface of the paper stack on the paper 

feed table 1 has reached a prescribed height by the 
upward movement of the paper feed table 1. The motor 

13 is driven in the upward direction in an intermittent 
manner until the upper limit sensor 19 has detected 

that the upper surface of the paper stack on the paper 
feed table 1 has reached the prescribed height, and the 

duration of the intermittent drive period of the 
electric motor 13 is gradually increased with the 

elapsing of time until the upper limit detecting sensor 
19 has detected that the upper surface of the paper 

stack on the paper feed table 1 has been positioned at 
the prescribed height.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vertical 
movement control device for a paper feed table device 
for use in various image forming devices such as 
printing devices, duplicating devices and facsimile 
devices. As a paper feed table for use in various image 
forming devices such as printing devices, duplicating 
devices and facsimile devices, there is known the 
elevator type paper feed table device provided with a 
paper feed table intended for placing a stack of paper 
thereon and adapted to be vertically moved by an 
electric motor. In an elevator type paper feed table device, it is 
detected by using upper limit detecting means when the 
upper surface of the paper stack on the paper feed 
table has been positioned by the vertical movement of 
the paper feed table at a prescribed height for taking 
out the uppermost paper sheet with paper feed rollers 
or the like, and once it is detected that the upper 
surface of the paper stack on the paper feed table has 
reached the prescribed height, the electric motor is 
stopped from lifting the paper feed table. Every time 
it is detected by the upper limit detecting means that 
the upper surface of the paper stack on the paper feed 
table has gone below the prescribed height by more than 
a prescribed amount due to the feeding of the paper 
from the paper feed table, the electric motor is 
activated so as to lift the paper feed table by the 
corresponding amount. In such an elevator type paper feed table device, 
it is essential for accurate and satisfactory paper  
 
feeding action to be carried out at an appropriate 
paper feed pressure that the paper feed table stops its 
upward movement as soon as the upper limit detecting 
means has detected that the upper surface of the paper 
stack on the paper feed table has reached the 
prescribed height. If there is any fluctuation in the 
height of the paper feed table, the paper feed pressure 
also fluctuates, and a satisfactory sheet by sheet 
paper feeding action cannot be attained particularly 
when relatively thin paper is to be fed. Based on such a consideration, it is conceivable 
to reduce the rotational speed of the electric motor by 
controlling the voltage of the electric power supplied 
to the motor when the thickness of the paper to be fed 
is relatively small so that the speed of the vertical 
movement of the paper feed table may be reduced and the 
unpredictable overrunning of the electric motor due to 
the inertia of the electric motor as it stops may be 
controlled. However, according to this

<CLAIMS>
A vertical movement control device for a paper feed 
table device including a paper feed table (1) which carries a 

paper stack thereon and can be vertically moved by an electric 
motor (13), comprising: 


upper limit detecting means (19) for detecting if an 
upper surface of said paper stack on said paper feed table (1) 

has been positioned at a prescribed height by a vertical 
movement of said paper feed table (1); and 
control means (21,23,25) for intermittently activating 
said electric motor (13) so as to lift said paper feed table 

(1) until said upper limit detecting means (19) has detected 
that said upper surface of said paper stack on said paper feed 

table (19) has been positioned at said prescribed height,
 
   characterized in that said control means (21,23,25) 

further gradually increases the duty ratio of said 
intermittent activation of said electric motor (13) with 

elapsing of time until said upper limit detecting means (19) 
has detected that said upper surface of said paper stack on 

said paper feed table (1) has been positioned at said 
prescribed height. 
A vertical movement control device for a paper feed 
table device according to Claim 1, characterized in that said 

duty ratio is gradually increased by increasing a period of 
activating said electric motor (13) while keeping a period of 

deactivating said electric motor (13) fixed in each duty cycle 
of said electric motor (13).
