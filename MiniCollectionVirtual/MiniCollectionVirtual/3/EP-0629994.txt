<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic probe (400) including one or more piezoelectric ceramic 
elements (501) mounted on an 

acoustically damping support body (504). Desired acoustic signals are 
transmitted and received through 

a front portion (511) of the probe (400) while unwanted acoustic signals 
are dampened by the support body (504) at 

the rear portion of the probe (400). Each element (501) has a respective 
rear face and a respective piezoelectric 

ceramic layer (502) integral therewith to provide efficient acoustic 
coupling between the element (501) and the 

acoustically damping support body (504). The respective piezoelectric 
layer (502) of each element (501) includes 

shallow grooves (505) disposed on the respective rear face of each 
piezoelectric element (501). A groove 

volume fraction of the piezoelectric layer (502) is selected to control 
acoustic impedance of the 

piezoelectric layer (502) so as to provide a desired acoustic 
impedance match between a bulk acoustic 

impedance of the element (501) and an acoustic impedance of the 
acoustically damping support body (504). 

Electrodes (507) extend into and contact the grooves (505), imposing 
electrical boundary requirements that 

support a desired electrical field distribution within the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ultrasonic probes and more specifically to 
ultrasonic probes for acoustic imaging. Ultrasonic probes provide a convenient and accurate way of gathering information about 
various structures of interest within a body being analyzed. In general, the various structures of 
interest have acoustic impedances that are different than an acoustic impedance of a medium of 
the body surrounding the structures. In operation, such ultrasonic probes generate a beam of 
broadband acoustic waves that is then coupled from the probe, though a lens, and into the medium 
of the body so that the acoustic beam is focussed by the lens and transmitted into the body. As 
the focussed acoustic beam propagates through the body, part of the signal is reflected by the 
various structures within the body and then received by the ultrasonic probe. By analyzing a 
relative temporal delay and intensity of the reflected acoustic waves received by the probe, a 
spaced relation of the various structures within the body and qualities related to the acoustic 
impedance of the structures can be extrapolated from the reflected signal. For example, medical ultrasonic probes provide a convenient and accurate way for a 
physician to collect imaging data of various anatomical parts, such as heart tissue or fetal tissue 
structures within a body of a patient. In general, the heart or fetal tissues of interest have acoustic 
impedances that are different than an acoustic impedance of a fluid medium of the body surrounding 
the tissue structures. In operation, such a medical probe generates a beam of broadband acoustic 
waves that is then acoustically coupled from a front portion of the probe, through an acoustic lens, 
and into the medium of the patient's body, so that the beam is focussed and transmitted into the 
patient's body. Typically, this acoustic coupling is achieved by pressing the front portion of the 
probe having the lens mounted thereon into contact with a surface of the abdomen of the patient. 
Alternatively, more invasive means are used, such as inserting the front portion of the probe into 
the body through a catheter. As the acoustic signal propagates through the patient's body, part of the acoustic beam is 
weakly reflected by the various tissue structures within the body and received by the front portion 
of the ultrasonic medical probe. By analyzing a relative temporal delay and intensity of the weakly 
reflected waves, an imaging system extrapolates an image from the weakly
