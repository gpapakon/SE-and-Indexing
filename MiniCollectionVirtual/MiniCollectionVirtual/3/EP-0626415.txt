<ABSTRACT>
A process for the condensation and/or equilibration of organosilicon compounds in the presence of oxygen-containing phosphazenes, in particular those of the formula  Y-PCl2=N(-PCl2=N)n-PCl2O     (I
>
 where     Y is a chlorine atom or a hydroxyl group, and   n is 0 or an integer from 1 to 8, and/or condensation products thereof.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the condensation and/or equilibration 
of an organosilicon compound in the presence of oxygen-containing 

phosphazenes of the general formula: 

Y-PCl
2
=N(-PCl
2
=N)
n
-PCl
2
O
 
in which 


Y denotes a chlorine atom or the hydroxyl group and 
n denotes 0 or an integer from 1 to 8, 
 
and/or condensation products thereof,
 
with the proviso that all or some of the chlorine atoms 

shown in formula (I) can be replaced by radicals Q, in 
which Q denotes the hydroxyl group, monovalent organic 

radicals, such as alkoxy radicals or aryloxy radicals, 
halogen atoms other than chlorine, organosilicon radicals 

and phosphorus-containing radicals. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that n is an integer from 1 to 3. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
2, characterized in that the oxygen-containing 

phosphazenes are employed in an amount of 0.1 to 1,000 
ppm by weight (parts by weight per million parts by 

weight), based on the total weight of the organosilicon 
compounds to be subjected to condensation and/or to be 

equilibrated. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the oxygen-containing 

phosphazenes are employed as a mixture with a halogenfree 
organic solvent. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that it is carried out at 50 to 

200Â°C. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that it is carried out under a 

pressure below 80 kPa.
