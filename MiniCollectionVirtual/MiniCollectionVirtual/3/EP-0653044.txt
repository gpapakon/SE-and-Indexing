<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an enhanced type of fin (14) for making an enhanced serrated finned tube (10) for use in heat exchange applications. The segments (24), which are formed on the fin (14) when the fin is serrated, are enhanced either prior to serration or after serration. The enhancement consists of impressing, cutting or otherwise providing indentations (74) into the segments (24), thus broadening the segments, increasing their surface area, and increasing their heat transfer capability. In addition, the base portion, i.e. the unserrated proximal portion of the fin, may also be enhanced to increase its surface area.

 ENHANCED SERRATED FIN FOR FINNED TUBE Background of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe present invention is an enhanced type of fin for a serrated finned tube. The enhancement consists of increasing the fin's heat transfer capability by increasing the surface area of the segments provided on the fin. Enhancement may be performed either prior to or after serration of the fin into segments. The enhancement of the present invention may be accomplished either by impressing, cutting, flattening, rolling or otherwise providing indentations into the segments, thus broadening the segments and increasing their surface area. The unserrated base portion of the fin may also be enhanced. 2. The Prior ArtFinned tubes are employed in a process heater or boiler. Finned tubes are used because the fins on the tubes increase the exterior surface area of the tubes and thus increase their heat transfer capability. The function of the finned tubes is to transfer heat from hot flue gases located outside the finned tubes to a liquid, generally high purity water or a hydrocarbon, circulating inside the finned tubes. The heated liquid is used to operate a turbine or used for other process purposes . Because of the high cost of fuel required to heat the liquid, it is important that tiansfer of thermal energy, i.e. heat, through the finned tube be as efficient as possible so the amount of fuel can be reduced. When the number of BTU's of fuel needed to heat the liquid is reduced, operating costs 

are significantly reduced, also. For these reasons finned tubes having large exterior surface areas are desirable.The exterior surface areas of prior art finned tubes have been increased by at least two means, spacing the fins closer together and providing higher fins.First, the fins of prior art finned tubes are attached to a pipe helically with adjacent helical spirals of the fins spaced apart. By spacing the fins closer together, more fins, and thus more surface area, can be attached to the tube per unit surface area of the tube, thus increasing the effective surface area of the tube.However, if adjacent spirals of fins are spaced too closely together, space between adjacent fin spirals can plug up or become fouled. Fouling is dependent on the type of fuel which is burned. The resulting inadequate flow of flue gas between the fin spirals decreases their ability to absorb thermal energy from the flue gas. Also, if spaced still closer together, adjacent fins touch each other, thus decreasing their effective surface area with a
