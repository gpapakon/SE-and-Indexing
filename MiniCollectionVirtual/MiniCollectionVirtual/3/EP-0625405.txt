<ABSTRACT>
A machine (1) including a loading station (2) for 
loading a pack (6) of panels; a cutting station (4) in 

which a cutting line (A) is defined; a fixed structure 
(3) located between the loading and cutting stations and 

presenting a work surface (3a); and a device (5) for 90° 
rotation of the pack of panels loaded onto the work 

surface. The device includes a frame (22) for supporting 
the pack; means (24) for moving the frame from a level 

below to a level above the work surface and vice versa; 
and means (23) for rotating the frame 90° clockwise and 

vice versa. The work surface presents a first (15 and 
16) and second (17, 18 and 16) opening with longitudinal 

axes respectively parallel and perpendicular to the 
cutting line, for enabling movement of the frame from a 

level below to a level above the work surface and vice 
versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panel cutting 
machine. Known panel cutting machines substantially 
comprise a loading station, at least one cutting 
station, and a fixed work surface along which packs of 
panels are transferred from the loading to the cutting 
station. Some machines, particularly those for cutting 
large-size panels, feature a system whereby the pack for 
supply to the cutting station is rotated 90°, to enable 
the pack to be fed to the cutting station with its 
longer or shorter side parallel to the cutting line. A first currently marketed solution provides for 
translating and rotating the pack by means of a rotary 
arm with air-powered grippers by which the pack is 
engaged. Such a solution presents substantially two 
drawbacks consisting in the large size of the work 
surface, and chafing between the work surface and the 
pack. The length of the work surface in fact must be at 
least equal to the sum of the longer and shorter sides 
of the pack, while chafing increases the force demanded  
 
of the grippers and the rotary arm for respectively 
keeping the individual panels in the pack aligned, and 
for rotating the pack. A second currently marketed solution provides, 
with the aid of a contrast roller projecting from the 
work surface, for rotating the pack by means of an 
air-powered gripper which engages one corner of the pack 
and travels in a direction perpendicular to the cutting 
line. The main drawback of this solution is the chafing 
between the pack and the work surface, which results in 
misalignment of the individual panels in the pack even 
when considerable force is exerted by the grippers. A third solution features a pack lifting device 
with suction cup type gripping means for engaging the 
pack, and housed inside a compartment in a central 
portion of the work surface. In actual use, the device 
first moves upwards to raise the pack off the work 
surface, rotates 90° about a vertical axis, and then 
returns inside the compartment, depositing the pack on 
the work surface. The main drawback of this solution 
consists in the pack being positioned at all times in 
the central portion of the work surface and, hence, 
being cut along the central portion of the cutting line, 
thus increasing the amount of travel required of the 
cutting blade. The central position of the pack also 
increases the travel of follow-up tools and members 
after the first cut, thus resulting in an excessively 
long machine cycle which is inevitably reflected in  
 
production cost. A fourth
