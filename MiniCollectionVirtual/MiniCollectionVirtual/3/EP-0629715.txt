<ABSTRACT>
Improvement in dielectric film deposition technique on plastic substrates 
generally destined to goods and alimentary products packaging, 

to optical coatings, etc. 
The invention places in the deposition equipments area with metal reaction, 
to utilise in continuous vacuum equipments. 
In comparison with the traditional techniques, plastic substrate (2) is 
exposed to metal source (6) by a multipass system, such to be exposed 

many times, for some instants, under said source obtaining in this way, 
a much more long time for react with the reactive gaseous surrounding, 

possibly activated. 
The equipment is essentially constituted by a roll-to-roll device having 
a multi-return returns (1) configuration situated in a zone (Z1) with 

different pressure in respect to the deposition zone (Z2), so to permit 
the reaction with process gas. 
This improved technique allows a notable saving in costs and treated 
film production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an apparatus to be used for reactive metal
deposition in continuous vacuum equipments and a respective process.
This invention overcomes the incoveniences found in preceding
solutions as the substrate to be treated moves in a roll system,
devised in a way to allow the metal to deposit from a reaction of
reactive gas, possibly ionised and/or excited.In the last times the request for dielectric deposition films, especially on
plastic flexible substrates increased.A typical example is the coating by dielectric film of plastic sheets (for
example PE, PET, OPP) to realise barrier for oxygen and water
vapour, transparent, for products destined to alimentary packaging;
products sensible to oxygen and water vapour.However, dielectric films depositions, generally oxides, present
remarkable difficulties in the process, when physical vapour
deposition techniques (PVD: crucible evaporation, electron gun
evaporation, sputtering, etc.); or chemical vapour deposition phase
(CVD) is used.These problems are often connected to the difficulties caused by high
speed deposition of said materials.A well known method to overcome problems of dielectric direct
deposition is to vaporise metals in gaseous reactive environment, thereby
obtaining, for instance, oxides or nitrides from these metals. This kind of process, well known in the thin films field, involves however,
a restriction in the maximum speed of metal deposition, as the metal
needs the time to completely react with the gaseous environment,
optionally activated by ionisation and/or excitement.In the plastic film coatings, however, in continuous plants, constituted
with traditional configurations such as described in documents US-A-2 665 228 and DE-A-3 046 564, it results to be quite impossible. In fact,
the substrate sliding speed must be at least some metres per sec. and to
obtain the desired thickness of some tens mm (hundreds Ã…) of dielectric, the
instantaneous metal deposition rate is too high to obtain a complete
reaction, as the operation is made at a pressure below 0.133 Pa (10-3Torr).It is the principal object of the present invention that the substrate
maintains a sliding high speed providing a complete reaction of the
metal, as the period in which the substrate is submitted to the
oxidation is largely amplified by means of a series of short metal
depositions followed by a long running in a reactive ambient.It is possible moreover, by traditional methods, that the pressure, in the
deposition zone, results notably lower than that one
