<ABSTRACT>
A hinge pivot (5) can be secured to one of the two 
associated bosses (1,2) by means of a mechanical 

restraint (9) comprising a plunger (10), preferably 
a ball, freely accommodated in a radial socket (11) 

afforded by a lower part of the pivot (5) and opening 
onto its cylindrical surface; the plunger (10) is 

operated by an adjustment mechanism (12) comprising 
a screw (13) seated in the bottom end of the pivot (5) 

with the head (13t) accessible from externally of 
the relative boss (1,2), which, with the pivot (5) 

inserted, can be turned one way and the other to 
select a non-operative limit position in which the 

ball (10) lies completely within the socket (11), and an 
operative limit position in which the ball (10) emerges 

marginally from the socket, protruding beyond the 
surface of the pivot (5) and entering forcibly into 

contact with the inside wall of the boss (1,2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a butt hinge for 
door and window fixtures according to the preamble of claim 1. Conventionally, this type of hinge (for example EP-A-0 425 794) consists in two 
bosses, generally aluminium, secured respectively 
to the moving sash and to the fixed frame (or to a 
terminal portion of the tilt stay rod, in the case 
of the tilt-and-turn type sash) by way of flanges, 
using screws of which the heads are accommodated in 
respective sockets afforded by the flanges and the 
shanks either impinge on clamp plates insertable 
into longitudinal channels afforded by the section, 
or are driven into the section itself. The bosses exhibit respective through bores which, 
with the hinge fitted, are disposed substantially 
coaxial and accommodate a relative pivot allowing 
articulation of the sash and the frame; the hinge 
also incorporates an alignment sleeve embodied in 
plastic material, associated at least with the boss  
 
uppermost, which is interposed between the boss and 
the pivot and functions as a friction bearing. The pivot is fashioned generally in such a manner 
as to allow its concealment at one end (typically 
the bottom end, being the end most often exposed to 
view) by means of a cap snap-fitted directly to the 
pivot itself, whilst the remaining end exhibits a 
circumferential groove positioned externally of the 
bores and designed to accept a circlip by which the 
pivot is retained internally of the bosses through 
mechanical interference. A requirement that often arises when installing a 
fixture, for example when the hinge pivot cannot be 
inserted from above due to the obstruction created 
by a low roller blind casing, or, in the particular 
instance of a tilt-and-turn window, when the fitter 
first anchors the fixed frame and then proceeds to 
hang the sash, locating the bottom hinge initially 
and then making the assembly secure by joining the 
top hinge, is that the fitter may in effect wish to 
complete the assembly operation by inserting the 
pivot of the top hinge from beneath. The solution previously outlined betrays certain 
drawbacks, however: it has been found in practice 
that the expedient of securing and concealing the  
 
pivot with a circlip uppermost and a cap at bottom 
can be less than wholly reliable in some instances, 
and not especially suitable in terms of appearance. 
For example, there are often circumstances during 
installation in which the fitter is obliged to let 
go the top part of the fixture momentarily and may 
subsequently forget

<CLAIMS>
A butt hinge for door and window fixtures, of the 
type consisting in two bosses (1, 2) associated 

respectively with a moving sash and a fixed frame 
by way of relative flanges (3, 4) secured with 

relative fastening means to the sash and the frame, 
and a vertical hinge pivot (5) insertable together 

with at least one interposed alignment sleeve (6), 
accommodated by the upper boss (1, 2), into through 

bores (7, 8) afforded by the respective bosses, 
wherein the pivot (5) is provided with angular 

restraint and concealing means (9) associated with 
either end and interacting with the bosses (1, 2) 

characterized 

in that restraint means (9) comprise a plunger 
element (10) freely accommodated within a radial 

socket (11) fashioned in a lower portion of the 
pivot (5) and opening laterally onto the relative 

circumferential surface; and 
in that the plunger element (10) is capable of 
translatory motion brought about through the agency  

 
of adjustment means (12) associated with the bottom 

end of the pivot (5) and accessible from externally 
of the hinge bosses (1, 2) with the pivot inserted, 

in such a manner as to determine a non-operative 
limit position, in which the plunger element (10) 

is completely encompassed by the socket (11), and 
an operative limit position in which a portion of 

the plunger element (10) is disposed marginally 
beyond the circumferential compass of the pivot (5) 

and in stable contact with the internal surface of 
the relative hinge boss (1, 2). 
A hinge as in claim 1, wherein the plunger element 
(10) consists in a simple ball accommodated within 

a radial socket (11) of which the area opening onto 
the circumferential surface of the pivot (5) is 

upset or caulked in such a way as to prevent the 
ball (10) escaping. 
A hinge as in claim 1, wherein the plunger element 
(10) consists in a wedge accommodated within the 

radial socket (11). 
A hinge as in claim 1, wherein the plunger element 
(10) consists in a simple ball accommodated within  

 
a radial socket (11) of which the area opening onto 

the circumferential surface of the pivot (5) is 
upset or caulked in such a way as to prevent the 

ball (10) escaping, and adjustment means (12) are 
embodied as screw means (13) insertable threadedly 

into a blind tapped hole (14) disposed coaxially 
with the longitudinal axis of the pivot (5) and 

connecting with the radial socket (11) in such a 
way as to allow the translatory motion of the ball 

(10) between the non-operative and operative limit 
positions. 
A hinge as in claim 1, wherein the end of the 
inserted pivot (5) remote from the adjustment means 

(12) and occupying the upper hinge boss (1, 2) is 
capped by a concealing element (15) embodied in 

such a way as to engage in a positive fit with a 

groove (16) afforded by the relative end of the 
pivot (5), and comprising a disk portion (17p) 

uppermost of which the diameter (Da) is greater 
than the diameter (D) of the relative bore (7, 8), 

such that the pivot (5) is furnished with a stop 
shoulder as a result of the concealing element (15) 

being fitted.  
 
A hinge as in claim 1, wherein the length (L) of 
the pivot (5) together with the restraint and 

concealing means (9) is equal, in the operative 
position, to the length of the upper and lower 

hinge bosses (1, 2) placed end to end. 
A hinge as in claim 4, wherein screw means (13) 
consist in a socket screw exhibiting a head (13t) 

of diameter (13d) substantially equal to the 
diameter (D) of the bore (7, 8) offered by the 

relative hinge boss (1, 2).
