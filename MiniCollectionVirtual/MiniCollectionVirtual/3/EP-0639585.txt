<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elastase 
inhibitor, and in particular to compounds of general formula 
[I] and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Many elastase inhibitors have been known However, 
most of them are irreversible inhibitors which bind to hydroxy 
groups of serine residue in the active site irreversibly to 
deactivate and denaturize the enzymes. Thus there is fear of 
side-effects. On the other hand, as reversible inhibitors, 
substrate-like aldehydes, ketones, boronic acids or 
elastatinals derived from natural sources (Journal of 
Antibiotics, 28, 337-339, 1975), elasnin (Journal of The 
American Chemical Society, 101, 4386-4388, 1979) or the like 
are known. In spite of the expectation of elastase inhibitors 
as therapeutic agents for diseases such as acute arteritis, 
pulmonary emphysema, arterial sclerosis, articular rheumatism 
and metastasis and invasion of carcinoma, the inhibitors are 
not used as drugs since the problems of intracorporeal 
kinetics, side effects or the like have not been dissolved. The object of the present invention is to provide 
a new elastase inhibitor having a new structure.  The another object of the present invention is to 
provide a new elastase inhibitor which is useful in the 
treatment of acute arteritis, pulmonary emphysema, arterial 
sclerosis, articular rheumatism and metastasis and invasion of 
carcinoma. The still another object of the present invention is 
to provide a new elastase inhibitor which may not cause side-effects. The present inventors have discovered that the 
diketone derivatives of the following general formula [I] 
inhibit elastase activity potently and have completed the 
present invention. Thus the present invention provides compounds of 
general formula [I] 
or its hydrates, wherein
 
   R represents hydrogen atom, a lower alkanoylamino group, 
a lower alkyloxycarbonylamino group or an 
aralkyloxycarbonylamino group,
 
   R¹ and R² may be identical or different from each other 
and each represents a lower alkyl group,
 
   R³ represents a C₃-C₆ lower alkyl group, a cycloalkyl 
lower alkyl group or an aryl lower alkyl group.  In the specification the following abbreviations are 
used: 
THFtetrahydrofuran  DMF N,N-dimethylformamide  DMSOdimethylsulfoxide DCCN,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide EDCI·HCl1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) 
carbodiimide·hydrochloride HOBT·H₂O1-hydroxy-1H-benzotriazole·monohydrate HOSuN-hydroxysuccinimide DPPAdiphenylphosphorylazide PCCpyridinium chlorochromate PDCpyridinium dichromate
