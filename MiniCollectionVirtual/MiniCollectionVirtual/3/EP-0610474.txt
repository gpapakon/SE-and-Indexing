<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in animal cell culture, particularly to
improvements in methods for growing animal cells and nutrient media
therefor.The use of animal cell culture for the mass production of cell products
such as immunoglobulins, hormones and enzymes is becoming
increasingly important from a commercial point of view, and currently there
is considerable effort devoted to the development of cell culture
techniques for the optimisation of the large scale production of these
materials.Animal cells in culture require a basal nutrient mixture of salts, sugars,
amino acids and vitamins. Usually the mixture is supplemented with a
biological fluid or extract, in the absence of which most cells lose viability
or fail to proliferate. The most commonly used supplement is serum.The use of supplements, however, is not very satisfactory, since their
generally undefined nature, and the variations that can exist between
batches of a given type, can affect the success and reproducibility of a
culture. There have thus been numerous attempts to identify the active
factors in supplements such as serum, with a view to providing a better
defined medium to support the growth of cells in culture. To date, this
approach has met with limited success, largely due to the complex nature
of biological supplements and the very small amounts of active factors that
they contain.A number of supplement-free media have been described, however, some
of which are available commercially [see for example Murakami et al. 
Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 1158-1162 (1982); Darfler et al., Exp. Cell
Res. 138, 287-295 (1982); International Patent Specification No. WO
90/03430; and Forsbeck et al., Eur. J. Haematol. 39, 318-325].Supplement-free media generally contain a complex mixture of amino
acids, salts, vitamins, trace elements, carbohydrates and other growth
supporting components such as albumin, insulin, glutamine, transferrin,
ferritin and ethanolamine [see for example US Patent Specification No.
4816401]. When cultured in such media, animal cells remain viable for a
finite period of time, until one or more essential nutrients in the medium
become exhausted. At such time the medium may be supplemented with
a feed containing one or more energy sources and one or more amino
acids [see for example International Patent Specification No. WO
87/00195]. In this way the culture may be prolonged to increase yield of
cells or cell products.Metal ions, especially ferrous and ferric ions, are essential for animal cell
metabolism,

<CLAIMS>
A nutrient protein-free animal cell culture medium comprising
assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen, amino acids, inorganic ions,

trace elements and optionally lipids and growth promoters or
regulators in admixture with 2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one or

a derivative thereof wherein one or more ring carbon atoms are
substituted by aliphatic, aromatic or heteroaromatic groups.
A medium according to Claim 1 wherein the 2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one
or derivative thereof is present in an excess

molar concentration to the iron present.
A medium according to Claim 2 wherein the 2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one
or derivative thereof and iron are present at a

molar ratio of around 5 to 1 to around 70 to 1.
A medium according to any of the preceding claims for the continuous
growth of animal cells.
A medium according to Claim 4 wherein the animal cell is a
mammalian cell.
A medium according to Claim 5 wherein the mammalian cell is a
lymphoid cell.
A medium according to Claim 6 wherein the lymphoid cell is a
myeloma cell.
A process for obtaining an animal cell product by cell culture which
comprises the steps of (1) culturing animal cells which produce said

product in a nutrient culture medium comprising assimilable sources of
carbon, nitrogen, amino acids, iron and other inorganic ions, trace

elements and optionally lipids and growth promoters or regulators in
admixture with 2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one or a derivative

thereof wherein one or more ring carbon atoms are substituted by 
aliphatic, aromatic or heteroaromatic groups, (2) continuing the

culture until said product accumulates and (3) recovering said
product.
