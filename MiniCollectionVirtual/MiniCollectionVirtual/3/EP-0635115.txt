<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a location scale and an optical reading sensor for reading a location scale of this kind. The scale comprises bars (2) with a first edge and a second edge, either the first or the second edges being located at regular intervals. In order that both incremental data and absolute data might be included in the same scale, the bars (2) are of at least two different widths, and n successive bars (2) on the scale (1) form an individual code indicating the location of said n bars on the scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a location 
scale comprising bars with a first edge and a second 
edge, either the first or the second edges being located 
at regular intervals. The concepts first edge and second 
edge refer to edges located closer to and further from 
the beginning of the scale, respectively. The reading 
direction of the scale, which can naturally vary, has 
no effect on the use of these concepts. The invention also relates to an optical reading 
sensor for reading such a location scale, comprising 
several light receivers with different detection areas. Location scales that are used for tracking and 
localization of the mutual position of two targets 
capable of moving with respect to each other consist 
conventionally of scale bars that are of uniform width 
and located at regular distances. Such a scale is called 
an incremental scale. It is read by counting the number 
of bars starting either from the beginning of the scale 
or from a separate starting signal located on the scale. 
The problem that arises with a scale of this kind is 
that every time the incremental data is lost for some 
reason, the device must first be driven to the starting 
signal on the scale before the location data can be 
restored. In order to avoid this problem, it is known 
to dispose another scale beside an incremental scale, 
said other scale comprising absolute codes at regular 
intervals for indicating the location of the code. 
Consequently, it is not necessary to return to the 
beginning of the scale to restore location data when it 
is lost but only to the nearest absolute code. Such 
scales are also known wherein the incremental code and 
absolute codes are mixed with each other in such a  
 
manner that a starting signal for an absolute code 
occurs first on the scale and thereafter the actual 
absolute code at regular intervals. Such a scale is 
disclosed, for example, in German Offenlegungsschrift 
No.3,818,044. In its use, this code does not differ 
from the code wherein the incremental scale and the 
absolute codes are located on different scales in the 
sense that for restoring the location data, it is always 
necessary to return to the nearest absolute code. The primary object of the present invention is 
to provide a location scale wherein an incremental scale 
and absolute codes indicating location are combined in 
a new way, which enables the restoring of location data 
after it has been lost at a very short distance. This 
is achieved with a location scale of the invention, 
wherein

<CLAIMS>
A location scale comprising bars (2) with a 
first edge and a second edge, either the first or the 

second edges being located at regular intervals, 
wherein the scale comprises 

bars (2) of at least two different widths and that n 
successive bars (2) on the scale (1) form an individual 

code indicating the location of said n bars on the scale 
(1). 
A location scale according to claim 1, 
wherein the bars (2) are of 

two widths, whereby the code is binary. 
A location scale according to claim 2, 
wherein the distance between those edges of two successive 

bars (2) that are located at regular intervals is 
three units of length, wherein 

the width of the narrower bar is one unit of 
length, and that of the wider bar is two units of 

length. 
An optical reading sensor for reading a 
location scale according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 

comprising several light receivers with different detection 
areas, characterized in that, it comprises 

six light receivers for forming three information 
signals, the first one indicating those edges of 

the scale bars (2) that are located at regular intervals, 
the second one indicating the direction of propagation 

on the scale (1), and the third one indicating 
the width of the scale bars (2), and that it further 

comprises a shift register for recording the information 
about the width of at least n successive scale bars for 

obtaining an individual code indicating the location of 
said n bars on the scale.  

 
An optical reading sensor according to claim 
3, wherein the total length 

of the detection area formed by the light receivers in 
the direction of the scale (1) corresponds to the 

distance between those edges of the scale bars (2) that 
are located at regular intervals.
