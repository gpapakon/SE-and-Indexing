<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for preparing an analysis gas, having a condensate separator working according to the principle of permeation distillation, which essentially consists of an outer tube with an inner tube lying on the inside and consisting of a material which is permeable to water vapour. In order, in the case of such a device, to keep the efficiency of the condensate separator optimally constant, it is proposed according to the invention for the condensate separator to be thermally insulated with respect to the exterior, to be arranged in a holder and to be thermally coupled to a thermostatic (thermostated) cooler.
