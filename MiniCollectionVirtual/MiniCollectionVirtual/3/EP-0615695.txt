<DESCRIPTION>
In continuous, rotary pressure sterilizers for containerized foods, at 
least one vessel (or shell) is used for heating filled containers and a separate 
vessel is used for cooling the filled containers, such as cans, plastic 
containers, lithographed containers and glass containers. Lubricants used in 
the sterilizers find there way into the shell interior and cause surface 
contamination and discoloration of the containers. Especially plastic and 
lithographed containers are visibly coated. US-A-1978656 discloses a rotary transfer valve comprising a 
plurality of packing plates pressed by springs against a housing, the rotary 
transfer valve requiring lubricant to reduce friction between the moving parts 
of the apparatus. DE-A-2224493 illustrates a transport system to be used in sterilisation 
units. The containers are transported within a hollow profile by an 
endless screw, the lower side of the hollow profile and the screw surface 
being coated with a low-friction material such as PTFE. It is an object of the invention to provide a sterilizer, which 
utilizes less or no lubricants, therefore providing a sterilizer with less 
contaminants. The wear components must be suitable for the steam and 
water environment. The invention provides a sterilizer with lubeless or almost lubeless 
joints. Figure 1 is a transverse section of a rotary sterilizer cooker 
system. Figure 2 is a cross section of the rotary vessel transfer valve of 
the rotary sterilizer cooker system taken along line 2-2 of Figure 1.  
 Figure 3 is an exploded view of the rotary vessel transfer valve 
of the rotary sterilizer cooker system of Figure 1. Figure 1 is a section of a rotary sterilizer cooker system 10, 
which comprises an infeed rotary valve 12, a rotary sterilizer cooker 13, a 
rotary vessel transfer valve 14, a rotary cooler 15, and a discharge rotary 
valve 16. The infeed rotary valve 12, comprises an infeed rotary valve 
housing 18 and an infeed rotary valve rotor 19. The rotary sterilizer cooker 
13, comprises a rotary sterilizer cooker vessel 21, a rotary sterilizer cooker 
reel 22, and a rotary sterilizer cooker ejector 23. The rotary vessel transfer 
valve 14, comprises a rotary vessel transfer valve housing 24 and a rotary 
vessel transfer valve rotor 25. The rotary cooler 15, comprises a rotary 
cooler vessel 27, a rotary cooler reel 28 and a rotary cooler ejector 29.  
 
The discharge rotary valve 16, comprises a discharge rotary 
valve housing 30 and a discharge rotary valve rotor 31. Cans or other containers 34,
