<ABSTRACT>
Weeds grow on the ballast of railway tracks, on sports fields, such as plastic running tracks, in parking lots and on cemetery paths. A machine is disclosed for eliminating them more economically. The weeds are sprayed with boiling water and steam at temperatures from 90 DEG  to 140 DEG . A travelling device is used for that purpose having a water container, a heating device and spraying nozzles. When heated, the plant protein coagulates, and chlorophyll is totally or partially destroyed, causing the weeds to wither. The boiling water and steam can also be used to eliminate graffiti, oil traces and chewing gum from surfaces of all types, and thus to clean said surfaces.

A method of clearing weeds and exterminating seeds thereof and
cleaning surfaces by spraying the weeds and the surface of the ground

covered thereby with superheated steam and/or hot water issuing from at
least one nozzle at a temperature of at least 140째C and under a pressure of

at least 60 bars, wherein the superheated steam issues from the nozzle at
such a temperature and under such a pressure that it strikes against the

weeds or the surface of the ground at a temperature of at least 140째C and
under a pressure of at least 60 bars.
A method according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the vegetation
point of the plant is heated to at least 70째C by the superheated steam

hitting same.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that
 the
superheated steam is sprayed into the upper layers of the surface of the

ground.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that
 the
superheated steam is sprayed into the ground to a depth of 10 mm.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that

leaves and stalks of the weed plants are completely wetted with
superheated steam.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one or more of
claims 1 to 5 comprising a storage container for water, a pressure pump

(18) connected thereto, a heating device (20) for heating water to a
temperature of over 140째C, at least one nozzle (32) for spraying 

superheated steam on to the surface of the ground (44), and a conduit
arrangement (16, 26) between the above-stated components.
Apparatus according to claim 6 
characterised in that
 it is arranged
on a trailer (46).
Apparatus according to claim 6 
characterised in that
 a plurality of
nozzles (32) are arranged in mutually juxtaposed relationship, are fixed

jointly to a holder and are connected to a short, heat-insulated feed conduit
(26) for superheated steam.
Apparatus according to claim 8 
characterised in that
 a plurality of
nozzles (32) are arranged in mutually juxtaposed relationship on a

distributor rake (28).
Apparatus according to claim 6 
characterised in that
 the heating
device (20) is a continuous flow heater.
Apparatus according to one or more of claims 6 to 10

characterised in that
 it is suspended on a municipal sprinkler vehicle (36).
Apparatus according to claim 6 and claims 8 to 11 
characterised
in that
 it is mounted to the front hydraulic system (40) of a goods vehicle.
Apparatus according to claim 8 
characterised in that
 mounted to
the distributor rake (28) is an elastic curtain (34) enclosing the nozzles

(32).
