<ABSTRACT>
On a cigarette filter assembly machine (2), a 
first (21) and second (22) succession of side by side, 

oppositely-oriented filter-tipped cigarettes (11) are 
fed to a turnover unit (24) settable to two distinct 

operating positions for turning over by 180째 the 
cigarettes (11a; 11b) in one (21) or other (22) of the 

two successions (21, 22); the overturned cigarettes 
(11a; 11b) being transferred onto the opposite side of 

the cigarettes (11b; 11a) in the other succession (22; 
21) to form two successions (21, 22) of equioriented, 

transversely-spaced cigarettes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing filter-tipped cigarettes.As described, for example, in British Patent
n. 2,241,866, filter-tipped cigarettes are formed on a
filter assembly machine, along a first portion of which
each portion in a first succession of cigarette portions
with a given spacing is joined, at a rolling station and
by means of a strip connecting element, to a
corresponding portion in a second succession of
cigarette portions, to form a tobacco item hereinafter
referred to as a "double cigarette". Each double
cigarette consists of two cigarette portions separated
by a double filter connected integral with the two
cigarette portions by said connecting element, the
central portion of which surrounds the double filter,
and each end portion of which surrounds the end of a
respective cigarette portion.Again according to the above British patent, once
formed, the double cigarettes are fed successively 
through a cutting station where they are cut
transversely in half to form two successions of
oppositely-oriented single cigarettes. That is,
downstream from the cutting station, the cigarettes in
each pair of cigarettes formed by cutting a respective
double cigarette are arranged with the respective
filters facing and substantially contacting each other.According to the above British patent, the two
successions of filter-tipped cigarettes are then fed to
a turnover station where each cigarette in one
succession is turned over and fed into the space between
two adjacent cigarettes in the other succession, to form
a single succession of equioriented cigarettes, which
are then fed to the output of the filter assembly
machine and from there to the input of a packing
machine.It has recently been found necessary to connect
the filter assembly machine to a packing assembly
consisting of a double packing machine, i.e. with two
packing lines, or of a pair of individual packing
machines. In other words, the problem has arisen -of
connecting the filter assembly machine to a packing
assembly presenting two inputs a given distance apart.One possible solution would be to employ a
two-line filter assembly machine of the type described
in British Patents n. 2,201,576 and n. 2,202,127, but
without the turnover station at the output, which forms
the two lines into one. This, however, obviously poses 
the problem of devising a packing assembly with two
inputs capable of receiving respective successions of
oppositely-oriented cigarettes.Recently, the above problem has been solved using
a filter
