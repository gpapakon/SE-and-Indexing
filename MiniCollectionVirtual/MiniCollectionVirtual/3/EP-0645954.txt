<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a casing comprising a basic electronic circuit (12-1) mounted on a printed circuit (12) equipped with pins (12-2) intended to connect the basic circuit to elements external to the casing. The casing is closed by an insulating cover (14) complete with holes (14-1) through which the pins pass. The cover is a printed circuit on which a secondary electronic circuit (15) is mounted, the holes being metallised in order to allow the secondary circuit to be connected to the basic circuit via the pins.
