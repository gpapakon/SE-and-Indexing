<ABSTRACT>
A ceiling mount (1) for bearing medical appliances (6) and feeding through supply devices for medical use is intended to be designed with mount arms (3, 4) and with a bearing column (5) such that its production is simple and cost-effective. For this purpose, the mount arms (3, 4) are designed from an extruded profile of an essentially rectangular cross-section with in each case one longitudinal web (14 or 15), which extends parallel to the side walls (10, 11) and is at a distance therefrom, between upper wall and lower wall (8, 9) and a duct (18) which is formed between upper wall and lower wall and the webs and is intended for the supply lines.
