<ABSTRACT>
In a system for standardising milk, measurement differences (d1...d12) are compensated for in the context of a periodic, automatic zero offset correction. The difference (d1...d12) to be compensated is compared with a predefined tolerance range (B0, Bu). If it is within this range, it is taken as the basis for the computerised measured-value compensation until the next zero offset correction is carried out. If it (d7, d10) is outside the tolerance range (B0, Bu) then, instead, use is made of a safety value (S7, S10) determined on the basis of previous differences (d1 ... d12) located within the predefined tolerance range (B0, Bu).
