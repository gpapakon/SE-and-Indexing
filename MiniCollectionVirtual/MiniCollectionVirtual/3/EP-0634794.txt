<ABSTRACT>
A heat-conductive composite material comprises a three-layered core 
(14), which is composed of a copper sheet (11) of a high thermal expansion 

sandwiched between two metal sheets (12) of low thermal expansion each 
said two metal sheets (12) of low thermal expansion having a number of 

through-holes (13) in the direction of the thickness, the three sheets being 
laminated and integrated so that opposing surfaces of the core (14) are 

substantially flat and formed with the respective metal sheets (12) of low 
thermal expansion having a part of the copper sheet (11) filling and being 

exposed out of the metal surfaces of the sheets (12) of low thermal 
expansion through the through-holes (13). A copper foil layer (16) of high 

thermal expansion is welded to each of the outer surfaces of the core (14) 
to form a five layered composite material. The thickness (t₁) of the copper 

sheet (11), the thickness (t₂) of the metal sheets (12) and the thickness 
(t₃) of the metal foil layers (16) are such as to satisfy the relations: -(a) 

t₁ = 1t₁ to 3t₂ and -(b) t₃ ≦ (1/10)t₂. The the copper sheet 
(11) has a thermal conductivity of 140 W/m K o
r more at 20°C. 
Such a composite material is well suited to mount a semiconductor chip 
or a lead frame in a conductor package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-conductive composite material
which is particularly adapted for use in the manufacture of a substrate (heat
sink) for mounting a semiconductor chip thereon, or of a lead frame in
semiconductor packages.Here it is preferred if the thermal expansion coefficient and the thermal
conductivity of which material can be freely varied in any desired value for
the purpose of satisfying both the conformity with the thermal expansion
coefficient of the companion material to be welded thereto, (such companion
materials being metals, ceramics, Si or the like semiconductors or plastics)
and the excellent thermal conductivity to the said material. If this can be
satisfactorily achieved, the heat generated by semiconductor chips may
efficiently be released to the surrounding area. Such composite materials
should be easily weldable to a companion material and it should have
excellent surface properties.Specifically, the invention relates to a semi-conductive material
comprising a three-layered core, which is composed of a copper sheet of a
high thermal expansion sandwiched between two metal sheets of low thermal
expansion, each said two metal sheets of low thermal expansion having a
number of through-holes in the direction of the thickness, the three sheets
being laminated and integrated so that opposing surfaces of the core are
substantially flat and formed with the respective metal sheets of low thermal
expansion having a part of the copper sheet filling and being exposed out of
the metal surfaces of the sheets of low thermal expansion through the
through-holes, and characterized in that a copper foil layer (16) of high
thermal expansion is welded to each of the outer surfaces of the core to form
a five layered composite material; and wherein, the thickness (t1) of the
copper sheet, the thickness (t2) of the metal sheets and the thickness
(t3) of the metal foil layers are such as to satisfy the relations: -(a) t1 =
t2 to 3t2 and -(b) t3 ≦ (1/10)t2. Accordingly, the heat-conductive composite material to be provided by
the invention has an improved uniform heat-receiving effect and an improved
excellent heat-diffusing effect, and additionally it is free from fine pores on
the surface thereof and therefore has an excellent weldability with a thin film
of a plate coat of brazing material.Recently, integrated circuit chips (hereinafter referred to as "chips") of
semiconductor packages, especially those in LSI or ULSI for large-scaled
(super) computers, are being directed toward
