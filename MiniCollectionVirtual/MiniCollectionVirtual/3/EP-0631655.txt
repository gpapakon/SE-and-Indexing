<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed tank is of the type comprising an elongate cylindrical wall (2) closed by two transverse bottoms, a lower bottom (3) and an upper bottom (4) provided with a tapping orifice (6) fitted with a tapping member such as a valve (7) and a pressure reducer (8), its internal volume being occupied by an absorbent medium (11). According to the invention, a chamber (12) is provided on top of the absorbent medium, between said absorbent medium and the upper bottom of the tank, the volume of said chamber being at least equal to the volume of excess liquid phase fuel plus the volume of liquid fuel released by the absorbent medium after turning upside down the tank, the tapping orifice (6) being fitted with a tapping tube (13), having an narrow bore, and arranged upstream of the pressure reducer (8) and axially housed in the top chamber (12), and whose length (1) is at least equal to the height of liquid phase fuel which may be present in said chamber (12) when the tank is in the upside down position.

Reservoir of gaseous fuel in liquid phase, of the type including an 
elongate cylindrical wall (2) closed by two transverse end walls, one, the 

lower one (3) and the other, the upper one (4) provided with a draw-off 
tube orifice (6) equipped with a draw-off member such as a valve (7) and 

with a pressure reducer (8), its internal volume being occupied by an 
absorbent medium (11), characterised in that a chamber (12) is provided 

above the absorbent material, between the latter and the upper end wall 
of the reservoir, the volume of which is at least equal to the volume of 

liquid phase in excess increased by the volume of fuel released by the 
absorbent medium after turning the reservoir upside down, and in that 

the draw- off orifice (6) is equipped with a draw-off tube (13), of fine 
bore, positioned upstream of the pressure reducer (8), housed axially in 

the top chamber (12), and the length (L) of which is at least equal to the 
height of fuel in the liquid phase which may be in this chamber (12) 

when the reservoir is in the inverted position. 
Reservoir according to claim 1, characterised in that the absorbent 
medium is formed by cellulose based non-woven fibre. 
Reservoir according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a central 
absorbent channel (17) is formed along the longitudinal axis of the 

absorbent medium (11). 
Reservoir according to claim 3, characterised in that the draw-off 
tube (13) is placed on the axis of the central channel (17) of the 

absorbent medium, and its free end (13a) is placed in the plane of the 
upper face of the absorbent material (11). 
Reservoir according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the upper face of the absorbent material (11) is formed by a conical 

surface (14), the vertex of which is turned towards the side of the lower 
end wall (3) of the reservoir.
