<ABSTRACT>
A positioning device for seismic equipment which is towed by a seismic 
vessel is designed with a body part which is equipped with wings (7) and 

rudders (8, 6, 9, 5). Actuators are provided to position the wings (7) and 
rudders (8, 6, 9, 5). The device further comprises a control unit for 

processing of signals which preferably operate exclusively on the basis of 
information from the device or the ship, instruments for use in the 

positioning of the device and a communication system for the 
communication between the ship and the device and vice versa. It is 

further equipped with attachment devices ( 9), which are preferably 
provided at the front of the positioning device, and preferably in the 

vicinity of the wing's (7) attachment point to the device's body part for 
attaching one or more cables (26) and floats.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with seismic surveys. More
specifically it concerns a device for, and a method of towing a seismic
tow, consisting of a gun array and seismic streamers.In marine seismic surveys, a ship is used which tows seismic sources and
seismic streamers. The sources produce acoustic energy which is propagated in
the geological formations below the seabed where the survey is undertaken.
The sound pulse or shock wave generated by the sources is reflected as
acoustic waves. The seismic streamer consists of hydrophones which detect the
reflected acoustic waves, convert the signals to electrical pulses, and pass on
this information to a data acquisition system on board the vessel. Further
processing and analysis of the information give an indication of the structure in
the geological formations in which the survey has been conducted.A seismic source consists of a number of individual sound sources, e.g. airguns
or waterguns. An arrangement of individual guns is usually called a gun array.
Apart from the actual guns, a gun array also includes attachment devices, air
hoses, electrical wires and sensors. A gun array measures 10-30 metres in
length.A seismic streamer, often called a hydrophone cable, consists mainly of
hydrophones for the detection of acoustic waves, electronic modules, electrical
wires and sensors apart from the actual framework. Seismic streamers are
divided into sections approximately 100 metres in length, and have a total
length of 2,000 - 6,000 metres.A seismic tow or a seismic towing system consists of seismic streamers and
seismic sources. A common feature of these units is that they can be 
positioned astern of and to the side of the ship's line of travel. In addition they
are submerged in the water, the gun arrays at a depth of 5-15 metres below
the surface and the streamers at a depth of 5-40 metres.None of the above figures are absolute, and can, of course, vary outside those
limits given here.Seismic towing systems are becoming progressively more complex, i.e. they
are composed of more sources and streamers. Increasing demands are also
being made on the efficiency of a towing system. The efficiency can usually be
measured on the basis of the extent of coverage obtained by a seismic tow.
The coverage will be dependent on the width of the tow. One of the factors to
which particular importance is attached is the positioning of the seismic tow.
The quality of the collected data is dependent on how accurately the towing
system has been positioned. In this context
