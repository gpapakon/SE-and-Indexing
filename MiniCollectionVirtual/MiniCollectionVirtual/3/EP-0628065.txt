<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of 
compatibilization technology. In particular, this 
invention relates to the use of 
ethylene/methacrylate/acrylic acid terpolymers as 
compatibilizers for dissimilar elastomer blends. A considerable amount of research has been made 
over the last several years with a view to obtaining 
new polymeric materials with enhanced specific 
attributes for specific applications or a better 
combination of different attributes. Much attention 
is currently being devoted to the simplest route for 
combining outstanding properties of different 
existing polymers, that is, formation of polymer 
blends. Although increasing numbers of miscible 
blends are reported in the literature [D.R. Paul et. 
al., J. Macromol. Sci., Rev. Macromol. Chem., C-18:109 
(1980)], most polymers are nonetheless 
immiscible thus leading to heterophase polymer 
blends. In general, "compatibility (miscibility) is 
the exception, immiscibility is the rule" (Dobry and 
Boyer-Kawenski, J. Polymer Science, 1947). There are two widely useful types of elastomer 
blends: single phase and two phase blends. The  
 
single phase blend is miscible. The term 
miscibility does not imply ideal molecular mixing 
but suggests that the level of molecular mixing is 
adequate to yield macroscopic properties expected of 
a single-phase material. The formation of two-phase elastomer blend is 
not necessarily an unfavorable event since many 
useful properties, characteristic of a single phase, 
may be preserved in the blend composition while 
other properties may be averaged according to the 
blend composition. Proper control of overall 
elastomer blend morphology and good adhesion between 
the phases are in any case required in order to 
achieve good mechanical properties. The elastomer 
blend components that resist gross phase segregation 
and/or give desirable blend properties are 
frequently said to have a degree of "compatibility" 
even though in a thermodynamic sense they are not 
"miscible". It should be emphasized that 
"compatibility" and "miscibility" are two different 
terms. Compatibilization means the absence of 
separation or stratification of the components of 
the polymeric alloy during the expected useful 
lifetime of the product (Gaylord, N.G., in 
"Copolymers, Polyblends and Composites", Advances in 
Chemistry Series 142, American Chemical Society: 
Washington, D.C., 1975, p. 76). "Technological 
compatibilization", according to Coran and coworkers 
[Rubber Chem. Technol., 56, 1045 (1983)] is 
"the result
