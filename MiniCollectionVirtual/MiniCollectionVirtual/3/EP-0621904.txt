<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a device for heat-treating metal workpieces having at least two furnace units (12, 14) of which at least the first one (12) has a plurality of individual chambers (13), each of which can be closed by gastight doors (61). A workpiece charge can be directly fed into each individual chamber (13) as desired and, after heat treatment with individually controllable parameters (temperature, duration and atmosphere) removed for subsequent heat treatment in the next furnace unit (14). The installation is made particularly flexible by the modular division of the furnace units (12, 14) into individual chambers (13, 15, 16) which can be individually controlled.

Device for heat-treating metal workpieces having 

at least one first furnace unit (12; 52a, 52b; 92a 
to 92d) that can be closed by gas-tight doors (21; 

61; 101), for carrying out a first heat-treatment 
step; 
at least one second downstream furnace unit (14; 
54a, 54b; 94) that can be closed by gas-tight 

doors (61; 73; 101, 113), for carrying out a 
second heat-treatment step; 
the first furnace unit (12; 52a, 52b; 92a to 92d) 
and the second furnace unit (14; 54a, 54b; 94) 

being adapted for individual treatment of the 
workpieces of each workpiece charge, with respect 

to temperature, dwelling time and atmosphere; 
a feeding device (23, 39, 43; 63, 79, 83; 103a, 
103b, 119a, 119b, 123) for feeding workpieces in 

cycle-controlled manner to the at least one first 
furnace unit (12; 52a, 52b; 92a to 92d), the 

feeding device (23, 39, 43; 63, 79, 83; 103a, 
103b, 119a, 119b, 123) comprising a loading unit 

having low gas losses and, connected therewith, 
gas-tight first conveyor means (18; 58; 98a, 98b); 

and 
second gas-tight conveyor means (19; 59; 99) for 
transporting the workpieces at the end of the 

respective desired dwelling time from the at least 
one first furnace unit (12; 52a, 52b; 92a to 92d) 

to the at least one second furnace unit (14; 54a, 
54b; 94). 
wherein
the at least one first furnace unit (12; 52a, 52b; 
92a to 92d) comprises a plurality of individual 

chambers (13; 53; 93), each provided with an inlet 
and an outlet door (21; 61; 101), the temperature, 

dwelling time and atmosphere being individually 
controllable for each workpiece charge of each 

individual chamber (13; 53; 93); 
the first conveyor means are connected, as entry 
transfer lock (18; 58; 98a, 98b), with the inlet 

doors (21) of the individual chambers (13; 53, 
93), in order to enable workpiece charges to be 

directly fed-in, if desired; 
the second conveyor means are connected on the 
inlet side, as intermediate transfer lock (19; 59; 

99), to the outlet doors (21) of the individual 
chambers (13; 53; 93) in order to enable the 

workpiece charges to be directly carried off, if 
desired, while on their outlet end they are 

connected with the at least one second furnace 
unit (14; 54a, 54b; 94); and 
the loading unit is designed as a vacuum entry 
lock (23; 63; 103a, 103b). 
Device according to claim 1, wherein each individual 
chamber (13; 53; 93) is preceded by a cross-pusher 

means (26; 66; 106) for loading and unloading. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
intermediate transfer lock (19) can be connected with a 

further vacuum entry lock (24). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein at 
least one second furnace unit (14; 54a, 54b; 94) 

comprises a plurality of individual chambers (15, 16; 
55a, 55b, 56a, 56b; 95, 96), each of which can be 

closed by gas-tight doors (61; 73; 101, 113) and can be  
 

individually controlled with respect to temperature, 
dwelling time and atmosphere. 
Device according to claim 4, wherein an intermediate 
treatment chamber (15; 55a, 55b; 95) is provided in the 

at least one second furnace unit (14; 54a, 54b; 94), 
which can be connected with a downstream final 

treatment chamber (16; 56a, 56b; 96) via a gas-tight 
door (21; 61; 101). 
Device according to claim 5, wherein the final 
treatment chamber (16; 56a, 56b; 96) can be connected 

with a quenching bath (31; 71a, 71b) with discharge 
lock (111). 
Device according to any of claims 4 to 6, wherein the 
second furnace unit (54a, 94) can be connected with a 

single-unit unloading device (52, 112) with hardening 
press and re-cooling system (74; 114) for delicate 

workpieces. 
Device according to any of claims 4 to 7, wherein the 
downstream furnace unit (54b) can be connected with a 

high-pressure gas quenching system (75). 
Device according to claim 8, wherein cooling gas is fed 
into the high-pressure gas quenching system (75) of the 

intermediate transfer lock (59), the entry transfer 
lock (58) and/or the vacuum entry lock (63). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the downstream furnace unit (94) can be 

connected with a gas cooling lock (111).
