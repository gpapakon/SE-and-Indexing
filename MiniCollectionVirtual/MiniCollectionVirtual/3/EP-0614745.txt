<ABSTRACT>
Injection molding apparatus wherein a 
torpedo (46) is mounted at the front end of a nozzle (10) to 

provide a fixed ring gate (14). The torpedo (46) has an 
elongated central shaft (84) with a nose portion (106) which 

projects forwardly into a cylindrical opening (78) 
extending through the mold to the cavity (16). The outer 

surface (108) of the nose portion (106) is sufficiently spaced 
from the inner surface (80) of the opening (78) to form the ring 

gate (14) through which the melt flows into the cavity. 
The nose portion (106) of the central shaft (84) enhances heat 

transfer during the injection cycle and thus reduces 
cycle time and provides cleaner gates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
injection molding and more particularly to a torpedo 
which is mounted at the front end of a nozzle to 
provide a fixed ring gate. The use of injection molding torpedoes 
having an elongated central shaft with a pointed tip 
to provide a hot tip gate is well known. An early 
example is shown in the applicants' U.S. patent number 
4,450,999 which issued May 29, 1984. This has the 
disadvantage that the improvement in thermal 
conductivity in the gate area is limited by the shape 
of the hot tip. It is also known to provide a core ring gate 
around a valve member which extends through the cavity 
as well as the gate and is reciprocated between the 
open and closed positions. An example is seen in the 
applicants' U.S. patent number 4,521,179 which issued 
June 4, 1985. In addition to requiring actuating 
mechanism, this configuration has the disadvantage 
that it is only suitable for molding products with a 
core hole through them.  Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to at least partially overcome the 
disadvantages of the prior act by providing injection 
molding apparatus having a torpedo with a nose portion 
which extends into an opening through the mold to 
provide a fixed ring gate therebetween. To this end, in one of its aspects, the 
invention provides injection molding apparatus 
comprising a heated nozzle seated in a well in a mold 
and a torpedo to convey melt to an opening with an 
inner surface extending through the mold from the well 
to a cavity having a rear face, the nozzle having a 
rear end, a front end, a melt bore extending 
longitudinally therethrough from the rear end to the 
front end, and a seat extending around the melt bore 
at the front end of the nozzle, the torpedo having an 
outer collar, an elongated shaft extending centrally 
through the outer collar with an opening extending 
through the torpedo between the central shaft and the 
outer collar, and at least one support member 
extending across the opening between the central shaft 
and the outer collar, the outer collar being removably 
received in the seat at the front end of the nozzle  
 
with the opening through the torpedo aligned with the 
melt bore through the nozzle and the central shaft of 
the torpedo aligned with the opening through the mold 
to the cavity, having the improvement wherein the 
central shaft of the torpedo has a forwardly 
projecting nose portion with an outer surface 
extending centrally into the opening through the mold, 
the outer surface

<CLAIMS>
In an injection molding apparatus comprising 
a heated nozzle seated in a well in a mold and a 

torpedo to convey melt to an opening with an inner 
surface extending through the mold from the well to a 

cavity having a rear face, the nozzle having a rear 
end, a front end, a melt bore extending longitudinally 

therethrough from the rear end to the front end, and 
a seat extending around the melt bore at the front end 

of the nozzle, the torpedo having an outer collar, an 
elongated shaft extending centrally through the outer 

collar with an opening extending through the torpedo 
between the central shaft and the outer collar, and at 

least one support member extending across the opening 
between the central shaft and the outer collar, the 

outer collar being removably received in the seat at 
the front end of the nozzle with the opening through 

the torpedo aligned with the melt bore through the 
nozzle and the central shaft of the torpedo aligned 

with the opening through the mold to the cavity, the 
improvement wherein; 

   the central shaft of the torpedo has a 
forwardly projecting nose portion with an outer 

surface extending centrally into the opening through 
the mold, the nose portion of the elongated central 

 
shaft of the torpedo having a substantially flat front 

face substantially aligned with the rear face of the 
cavity, and the outer surface of the nose portion 

being sufficiently spaced from the inner surface of 
the opening through the mold to form a fixed ring gate 

through which the melt flows into the cavity. 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim 
1 wherein the inner surface of the opening extending 

through the mold from the well to the cavity is 
substantially cylindrical. 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in 
claim 2 wherein the elongated central shaft of the 

torpedo tapers inwardly to the nose portion and the 
outer surface of the nose portion flares outwardly 

towards the front face. 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in 
claim 3 wherein the elongated central shaft of the 

torpedo has a highly heat conductive inner portion and 
a wear resistant outer portion. 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in 
claim 4 wherein the nozzle is seated in the well 

having an inner surface in the mold with an insulative 
air space extending between the outer surface of the 

nozzle and the inner surface of the well, the outer 
 

collar of the torpedo has a cylindrical rear portion 
and a cylindrical front portion, the cylindrical rear 

portion of the outer collar being removably received 
in the seat at the front end of the nozzle and the 

cylindrical front portion of the outer collar being 
received in a circular seat in the mold, whereby the 

outer collar bridges the insulative air space 
extending between the nozzle and the mold. 
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in 
claim 5 wherein the rear portion of the outer collar 

of the torpedo has a threaded outer surface, the seat 
extending around the melt bore at the forward end of 

the nozzle has a matching threaded inner surface, and 
the outer collar of the torpedo has an engageable 

intermediate portion extending into the insulative air 
space between the front end of the nozzle and the mold 

to securely attach the torpedo to the nozzle by 
screwing the rear portion of the outer collar of the 

torpedo into the seat extending around the melt bore 

at the front end of the nozzle.
