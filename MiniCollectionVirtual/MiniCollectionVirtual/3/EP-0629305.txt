<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device to facilitate the
retrieval of stored information. More particularly it
relates to a device which has a form allowing economic
manufacture and captivation of an element of the
device, which needs to move to make the device
operational, until the device is about to be first put
into service.The storage and retrieval of information on related
matters is an ongoing requirement in modern society.
For example persons needing information relating dates
of sporting fixtures and locations thereof, or
conversions from one currency to another or from one
system of measurement to another do not want to consult
books or other bulky items and there is therefore a
need for a more readily accessible information source.A device of known type where an information bearing
slider panel is slid within a sleeve having a viewing
aperture or apertures to allow related information on
the slider panel to be seen has been widely used for
the above purposes. Such devices can be made in
convenient sizes that are readily housed in a wallet or
the like. The possibility of using such devices as an advertising
item of the give away type has been considered but the
cost of the device as commonly manufactured mitigates
against such use. The conventional methods of
manufacturing such devices known to the inventors
involve a large labour component with a corresponding
manufacture cost. It is the object of this invention
to provide an extremely low cost item by mechanising
the production of the device.Broadly stated the invention provides an information
retrieval device including a sleeve with a viewing
aperture and an information slide panel in the sleeve
where the slider panel is retained in the sleeve by a
frangible connecting means until the device is to be
used. The first force applied to the slider panel to
move it in the sleeve destroys the frangible connection
and the device can thereafter operate normally. The
manufacture of the device of the above form is fully
mechanical thereby eliminating the manual labour
component required hitherto to fabricate such devices.The present invention, more specifically, provides an
information retrieval device including an open ended
circumferentially closed sleeve with at least one
aperture in said sleeve to give viewing access to an
information bearing slider panel portion mounted in the
sleeve and retained therein by frangible connection 
means, said connection means being adapted to be broken by
a force applied to said slider panel portion to slide it
within
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information retrieval device comprising an open ended
circumferentially closed sleeve with at least one aperture in said sleeve to

give viewing access to an information bearing slider panel portion mounted
in the sleeve and retained therein by frangible connection means, said

connection means being adapted to be broken by a force applied to said slider
panel portion to slide it within said sleeve, characterised in that the sleeve

and the slider panel portion are provided by a single sheet of material
incorporating a plurality of edge to edge connected panel portions that

include in addition to the slider panel portion;

a sleeve front panel portion with two join edges respectively joined by
fold lines to one join edge of a glue panel portion and to a first join edge of

a sleeve back panel portion which has a second join edge connected by
frangible connection means comprised of sections of said material to a

connection edge of said slider panel, and where there is a fold along said
frangible connection means to place said slider panel portion in overlying

relationship with an inner face of said back panel portion and there is a fold
along the fold line between said front panel portion and said back panel

portion to place them in an overlying relationship with said slider panel
portion sandwiched therebetween and there is a fold along the fold line

between said front panel portion and a first edge of said glue panel portion
to place said glue panel portion in an overlying relationship with an outer

face of said back panel portion to which it is glued, and said frangible
connection means comprises sections of said material disposed between

adjacent ends of material penetrating cuts in a line of cuts extending in the
length direction of said sleeve.
An information retrieval device as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that said glue panel has a second edge opposite its first edge connected by a

cover fold line to a first edge of a cover panel which when folded on said
cover fold line so as to embrace said first join edge of the sleeve back panel

portion will overlie said sleeve front panel.
An information retrieval device as claimed in claim 1 or 2
characterised in that the slider panel portion is folded in concertina form.
A method of making an information retrieval device including an open
ended circumferentially closed sleeve with at least one aperture in said sleeve

to give viewing access to an information bearing slider panel portion mounted
in the sleeve and retained therein by frangible connection means, said

connection means being adapted to be broken by a force applied to said slider
panel portion to slide it within said sleeve;


said method including the steps of providing a sheet of stiff material,
forming parallel fold lines along said sheet to provide a front panel portion

disposed between a back panel portion of substantially the same width as the
front panel portion and a narrower glue panel portion and a further parallel

fold line along said sheet which is perforated to provide a frangible
connection means between said back panel portion and a slider panel

portion, providing at least one viewing aperture in at least one of the front
and back panel portions, followed by fabrication steps including forming a

fold along said perforated fold line to place said slider panel portion in
overlying relationship with an inner face of said back panel portion, forming

a fold along the fold line between said front panel portion and said back
panel portion to place the front and back panel portions in overlying

relationship with said slider panel portion sandwiched therebetween, forming 
a fold along the fold line between said front panel portion and said glue panel

portion to place said glue panel portion in an overlying relationship with part
of an outer face of said back panel portion and gluing said glue panel portion

to said back panel portion.
A method of making an information retrieval device including an open
ended circumferentially closed sleeve with at least one aperture in said sleeve

to give viewing access to an information bearing slider panel portion mounted
in the sleeve and retained therein by frangible connection means, said

connection means being adapted to be broken by a force applied to said slider
panel portion to slide it within said sleeve;


said method including the steps of providing a sheet of stiff material,
forming parallel fold lines along said sheet to provide a series of edge

connected panels consecutively comprising a cover panel, a glue panel, a
sleeve front panel, a sleeve back panel and a slider panel with the fold line

between said sleeve back panel and said slider panel perforated to provide a
frangible connection means between said back panel and said slider panel,

providing at least one viewing aperture in said sleeve front panel, followed

by fabrication steps including forming a fold along said perforated fold line
to place said slider panel portion in overlying relationship with an inner face

of said back panel portion, forming a fold along the fold line between said
front panel portion and said back panel portion to place the front and back

panel portions in overlying relationship with said slider panel portion
sandwiched therebetween, forming a fold along the fold line between said

front panel portion and said glue panel portion to place said glue panel
portion in an overlying relationship with an outer face of said back panel

portion and gluing said glue panel portion to said back panel portion, folding 
said cover panel portion around the fold line between said sleeve front and

back panel portions to embrace it to position said cover panel portion in
overlying relationship with said sleeve front panel portion.
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 including the step of
providing a finger grip notch in corresponding ends of each of the front and

back and glue panel portions to allow the slider panel to be gripped for the
application of force to break said frangible connection means and also to

move the slider panel when separated from the back panel portion within the
sleeve.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6 further including the
step of folding the slider panel portion into a concertina form prior to gluing

said glue panel portion to the back panel portion.
