<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heads for use in
ink jet printing, and more particularly to heads for use
in ink jet printing, having improved resistance to inks
containing acetylene glycol, glycol ether or the like.In general, a printing head for use in an ink jet
printing method comprises an orifice from which a
printing ink is jetted; an ink channel, connected to the
orifice, having a portion at which energy is applied to a
printing ink so that the ink can be jetted; and an ink
container in which a printing ink to be supplied to the
ink channel is stored. There has been known, as a method
for producing such a head for use in ink jet printing, a
method in which an ink channel is formed by providing a
minute groove in a substrate made of glass, a metal or
the like by means of, for instance, cutting or etching,
and by attaching thereto another substrate. Further,
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 43876/1982
discloses a method in which an activation-energy-ray-hardening
resin is coated onto a first substrate and
subjected to desired-pattern-wise exposure and then to
development to form therein a groove for an ink channel,
followed by attaching thereto a second substrate to
finally form an ink channel. Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 191053/1992 discloses a
method in which a head for use in ink jet printing is
produced in the same way as the above method, by
superposing several layers of resin compositions. EP-A-0432795
also discloses an active energy-ray-curable resin composition
for use in an ink jet head.These methods using an activation-energy-ray-hardening
resin are advantageous in that a minute channel
for a liquid can be accurately formed with high yield and 
that the mass production of a head having such a channel
can be easily attained.On the other hand, a highly efficient ink containing
acetylene glycol or the like has been recently used as an
ink composition for ink jet printing.However, when such an ink composition containing
acetylene glycol, glycol ether or the like is applied to
the above head produced by using an activation-energy-ray-hardening
resin, there has been observed such a
phenomenon that the resin used for the head is damaged by
the ink composition. Due to this phenomenon, there has
been a limitation on the use of the highly efficient ink
composition containing acetylene glycol or the like to
the printing head produced by using an activation-energy-ray-hardening
resin.An object of the present invention is to provide a
printing head comprising an
