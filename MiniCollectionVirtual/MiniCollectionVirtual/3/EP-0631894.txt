<ABSTRACT>
Completely lining fuel tanks of motor vehicles with a mesh of thin metal foil or metal fibres in order to make the fuel tank explosion-proof and fire-proof is already known. In fuel tanks with flexible walls, however, the problem exists that, with the vibrations occurring whilst driving, the rough mesh structure damages the tank walls and that, due to the individual mesh blocks with which the fuel tank is lined moving against one another, abrasion occurs, as a result of which blockages of the fuel system can occur. In order to solve this problem, it is proposed to provide the mesh blocks with a low-friction coating.

<CLAIMS>
Explosion- and fire-proof fuel container for vehicles,
comprising a flexible container adapted in shape to a

cavity in the vehicle and a mesh structure filling out the
container interior made of metal foil or metal fibres

provided with breaks, whereby the mesh structure comprises
one or more mesh blocks, characterised in that said mesh

blocks are respectively provided with a smooth-surfaced
sliding covering on the external surfaces, whereby the

covering is provided with perforations such that the flow
of fuel between adjacent mesh blocks is not hindered.
Explosion- and fire-proof fuel container according to Claim
1, characterised in that the covering is made of a woven

fabric.
Explosion- and fire-proof fuel container according to Claim
1 or 2, characterised in that the covering is made of

metal.
Explosion- and fire-proof fuel container according to Claim
1 or 2, characterised in that the covering is made of

plastic.
Explosion- and fire-proof fuel container according to one
of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the woven fabric is

a fine-mesh filter fabric.
Explosion- and fire-proof fuel container according to one
of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that in the case of a

mesh block of a strand-like form, the covering has a hose-type
construction.
