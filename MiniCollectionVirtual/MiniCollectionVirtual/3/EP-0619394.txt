<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for setting dyes on fabrics in 
general, by a two-step process, which comprises, after the printing and 

drying of a textile support (2), an impregnation of the support by an alkali 
solution. 
The main feature of the invention is that, on the impregnated support (2), 
there is performed a vaporization, by arranging the textile support with free 

laps on supporting hollow rods (11) inside a fabric-lap evaporizer (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
setting dyes on fabrics in general, by the two-step 
process, as well as a system specifically designed 
for carrying out this method. As is known, the so-called two-step process 
for setting reactive dyes on cotton or viscose comprises 
a first step, in which on a textile support 
there is printed and dryed a semi-dense mixture, 
comprising a dye and a thickening agent. The second step of the process consists 
of causing the fabric to pass, after the printing 
and drying operation, through an alkali bath with an 
immediately subsequent vaporizing by using slightly 
super-heated steam, for a period of time which can 
vary from 12 to 15 seconds. Between the alkali bath and vaporizer a preheating 
device is usually included, for example, of 
the infrared ray type. This process is broadly used mainly for cotton 
or viscose fabrics, since it provides the possibility 
of printing and vaporizing the fabric in different 
days, and allows to obtain an optimum setting 
of the dyes, since the vaporizing operation is substantially  
 
of a wet-on-wet type. Moreover, no polluting additional product is 
used, such as urea or accelerating substances, and 
the method involves a low consume of power for the 
vaporization, together with a small cost for the 
dyes, which is much smaller than that required for 
a single-step setting process. In order to carry out the vaporization, there 
is at present used a vaporizer, comprising a tower 
or column, inside which there are held 8-12 meters 
of fabric. In the column, the fabric is entrained to 
vertically rise, as controlled by a driven cylinder, 
arranged at the top of the column, and then the 
fabric is caused to downwardly move and exit the 
processing column. The steam which is present inside the column 
or processing chamber has conventionally a temperature 
of 130Â°C, in order to assure a good setting 
of the dye. The use of such a column derives from the 
fact that, during the processing operations, it is 
necessary that the printed side of the fabric does 
not rub on the cylinder since such a rubbing would  
 
damage the printed material This is a great limitation for the use of 
the above mentioned process, since the processed 
fabric will have, for each processing cycle, a length 
of only ten meters, since it would be not possible 
to make columns having excessively great heights. Moreover, the use of a column or tower apparatus 
prevents the two step system from being applyed 
to knitted fabrics which would be
