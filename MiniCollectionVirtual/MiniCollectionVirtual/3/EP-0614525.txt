<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for monitoring a supply of gas such as the production of methane by anaerobic degradation of organic matter utilises a monometer (14) accurately to measure predetermined volumes of the gas. Each measured volume is discharged into a chamber (18) also of a predetermined volume and containing a second gas, in order to obtain a precisely known dilution of the gas production to be monitored. The chamber (18) contains a catalytic gas sensor (36) sensitive to the gas to be monitored and which produces an output of the first gas concentration within the chamber (18), from which the production rate and volume of the first gas can be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING A SUPPLY OF GASThis invention relates to a method and apparatus for monitoring a supply of gas.Throughout this Specification and Claims, the term "gas" is to be understood to extend to pure gas, vapours, or mixtures of gases and/or vapours, unless the context dictates otherwise.Although the invention is widely applicable, the background will be described with reference to monitoring methane production. Environmental concern has recently increased the importance of measuring the volume of methane produced by the anaerobic degradation of waste materials. In relation to landfill sites, it is important to know how much methane is produced and when. In another situation, increasing attention is being given to anaerobic degradation of sewage, because the methane produced can be used to provide power to the plant thus reducing its running costs. Although aerobic degradation may be desired to reduce the solids to the minimum, plant for such aerobic degradation may also be powered by the methane produced in the anaerobic degradation.It has thus become important to study the effect of anaerobic degradation, for example to determine, for a given material or materials, how much methane is produced, at what rate, and whether and to what extent production is affected by conditions such as temperature or the presence of other materials e.g. pollutants. The gases produced in anaerobic degradation are not all methane but contain, perhaps 20%, carbon dioxide. One conventional procedure for monitoring the production of methane is to use a pressure lock syringe 

 to withdraw a sample periodically from a sealed vial containing the matter being tested and to analyse the sample using a gas liguid chromatograph to determine the amount of methane in the sample. The amounts produced in successive samples are recorded and added to produce a total. The procedure is time consuming, involves the use of expensive equipment, in the form of the chromatograph, and being invasive is liable to operator error. In another known procedure, the percentage of methane in the gas produced is assumed and the volume of the total gas produced is monitored by letting the pressure in the vial build up to a small predetermined degree and then releasing the pressure and logging the event. Clearly the assumption of the percentage methane, which relies on knowing the composition of the sample to be tested, can be inaccurate.In both known procedures, the pressure rises significantly above atmospheric, which changes

CLAIMS
1. A method of monitoring a supply of one or more first gas "with a gas sensor, comprising the steps of: a) collecting a volume of gas containing the one or more first gas mixed with one or more gas to which the sensor is insensitive; b) diluting the collected volume in a chamber to a predetermined volume with one or more second gas to which the sensor is insensitive; and c) exposing the sensor to the diluted one or more first gas to provide a signal indicative of the concentration of the diluted one or more first gas.
2. A method as claimed in Claim 1, in which steps a) to c) are performed in repetitive cycles, and wherein the chamber is purged of the sensed gas in each cycle before the start of the next cycle.
3. A method as claimed in Claim 2, including the step of: d) adding the signals produced in step c) to provide a signal indicative of the total volume of the first gas collected.
4. A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein a volume of a mixture of hydrocarbon(s) with one or more gas to which the sensor is insensitive is collected in step a) and the volume of the mixture is diluted in step b) .
5. A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the sensor is operative to combust the hydrocarbon(s) so purging the chamber thereof.
6. A method as claimed in Claim 5, including the step of: d) integrating the signal indicative of concentration to give a signal indicative of the volume of the collected hydrocarbon(s) .
7. A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, including the steps of: 


 f) measuring the time over which the first gases and/or vapours are collected to produce a time indicative signal; and g) from the volume indicative signal and the time indicative signal, producing a signal indicative of the rate of collection of the first gas.
8. Apparatus for monitoring a supply of one or more first gas, comprising: a) means for collecting a pre-set volume of gas containing the one or more first gas and for diluting the collected gas to a predetermined volume with one or more second gas; b) a gas sensor sensitive to the diluted one or more first gas but not to the one or more second gas, to provide a signal indicative of the concentration of the diluted one or more first gas.
9. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 8, wherein the means for collecting and diluting a volume of the one or more first gas, comprises: valve means selectively operable to direct a supply of the first one or more gas to a manometer or to direct said one or more first gas from the manometer to a chamber; means to detect manometer liquid above a first relatively high level; means to detect manometer liquid below a second relatively low level; and control means to operate the valve to direct the one or more first gas to the manometer when the manometer liquid is detected above the high level and to direct the one or more first gas from the manometer to the chamber when the manometer liquid is detected below the low level.
10. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9, including an arrangement to purge the chamber and arranged repetitively to collect and dilute the one or more first gas. 11. Apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 8 to 10, wherein the gas sensor is operative to combust 


hydrocarbon gas to provide said signal indicative of concentration and thus to purge the chamber of said hydrocarbon gas.
12. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 11 when appendent to Claim 9 or 10, wherein the chamber is constructed so that oxygen can permeate or diffuse thereinto, to replace that used in combusting the hydrocarbon(s) .
13. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 11, including computer means for integrating the signal indicative of concentration to give a signal indicative of the volume of the collected hydrocarbon(s) .
14. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 13, wherein the computer means is arranged for adding the integrated signals to provide a signal indicative of the total volume of the hydrocarbon(s) collected.
15. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 13 or Claim 14, wherein the computer means is arranged for measuring the time over which the hydrocarbon(s) are collected to produce a time indicative signal; and from the volume indicative signal and the time indicative signal, producing a signal indicative of the rate of collection of the hydrocarbon(s) .
