<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in submitting the surface 
layer of an electrolytically oxidizable metal to the 

action of an electrical field with a higher field 
intensity than the breakdown intensity during an 

anodizing step. 
Under such conditions, extremely intense energy 
exchanges occur in a region confined on the surface of 

the immersed article; the resulting physical and 
chemical processes cause, among others, any impurities 

to be nearly immediately removed, and a useful surface 
conditioning layer for subsequent processes to be 

produced. 
The process is particularly useful for high-speed 
treatment of bands of light alloy or other oxidizable 

materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
According to the present state of the art, the
washing process commonly used by aluminum alloy
manufacturers or fabricators essentially consists in
a band degreasing step carried out in order to remove
greases or similar organic substances used in the
rolling process.Such a removal is carried out by bringing the
band to be washed into contact with a liquid phase
displaying strong affinity for the impurities,
substantially performing the task of transferring the
latter from the solid into the liquid phase.Said processes are usually carried out with
solvent liquids (e.g., trichloroethylene) or alkaline
solutions which are suitably buffered, therefore with
reduced reactivity towards aluminum; in order to cause
the impurities to diffuse, the processes known from
the prior art rely on diffusion (high-temperature
processes), or on kinds of fluxing (castings), or on
the supply of mechanical energy to the interface
(brushing, sonication).A rinsing step follows, often followed, in its
turn, by steps of anchoring functional groups for
surface protection, or acting as adhesion promoters
(oxidation, chromate treatment, phosphating treatment
or phospho-chromate treatment).In order to be effective, these processes require
a long enough surface-liquid contact time as to make 
it possible material to diffuse between the metal, the
limit layer, and the liquid, which time, when bands
are submitted to such a continuous, high-speed
treatment, may require that considerably long
facilities are used, with consequent large overall
dimensions and high costs; furthermore, the use of
hydrogenated rolling lubricants, such as, e.g., lauryl
alcohol, and the like, having electronic affinity for
aluminum, compromises the transfer of impurities to
the liquid phase, sometimes rendering necessary a
preliminary chemical etching step prior to the
subsequent treatments, with problems of disposal of
the resulting waste products consequently arising.Electrochemical processes are known as well in
the practice of metal articles degreasing, which
consist in submitting the metal surface to an anodic
or cathodic action, while said surface is immersed in
suitable electrolytic solutions.This practice, useful in order to activate the
surface as a preliminary step to electrodepositions
is, unfortunately, ineffective for degreasing
purposes, because the flow of the ionic species, and
of the released gases does not interact with the
presence of grease or oleol impurities.Due to such a reason, in the practical operations
of facilities for continuous band
