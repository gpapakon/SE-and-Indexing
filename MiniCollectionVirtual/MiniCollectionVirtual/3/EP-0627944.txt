<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods for use in photochemically
oxidizing gaseous halogenated organic compounds.A fragile and invisible layer of ozone some nine to fifty kilometers above
shields the earth's surface against harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It
has been discovered that this protective shield is being massively depleted. Such
is generally accepted to largely be the result of man-made chemicals that have
been and continue to be released into the atmosphere.Ozone is naturally produced in the stratosphere. Molecular oxygen, O2,
is naturally photodissociated into free oxygen atoms under the influence of
radiation from the sun. Such production of oxygen atoms leads immediately to
the production of ozone molecules as shown in the following equation,.
O2 + O + M → O3 + M,
where a triple collision between a molecule of oxygen O2, an atom of oxygen
O, and a third particle "M", which may be a molecule of oxygen or of nitrogen,
which absorbs excess reaction energy and results in formation of a molecule of
ozone, O3.Ozone-depleting chemicals fall into four major groups. The first is known
as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's). These are used as aerosol propellants,
refrigerants, blowing agents, solvents and sterilants. Freon-12
(dichlorodifluoromethane) is one example. A second group is known as "halons",
which are bromine-containing chemicals used as fire suppressants. A third group
is known as chlorocarbons, and include chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride
and 1,1,1-trichloromethane. A fourth group consists of relatives of the CFC's
called "hydrochlorofluorocarbons" (HCFC's). These are widely used as interim
substitutes for some CFC's, and typically have from 2% to 10% of the
ozone-destroying power of CFC's.When released during production and use, it is believed that ozone-depleting
chemicals remain in the atmosphere for decades, some even for
centuries. Once released they are atmospherically heated, wind and air current 
dispersed, and ultimately rise to 10 to 15 kilometers. There, ultraviolet light in
the wavelength range of from 170 to 230 nanometers breaks the molecules apart.
This releases chlorine, fluorine or bromine which contribute to the destruction
of ozone and the formation of ordinary oxygen, a substance which is useless for
screening out dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun.Once the molecules are broken, some of the fluorine combines with
hydrogen to form HF. Ultimately, the fluorine is precipitated into the lower
atmosphere where it ends up in water solution.
