<ABSTRACT>
A cadmium rare gas discharge lamp of the short arc type that has a 
high power of the spectra in a wavelength range of 210 nm to 230 nm and 

a stable lamp voltage in lighting operation for a long period. An arc tube 
(1) is provided within which are disposed opposed, spaced apart 

electrodes 
(2,3) and thermal insulation films (6,7). A rare gas is 

encapsulated together 
with metal cadmium and a quartz glass is used for the material of the arc 

tube whose OH radical has a weight content of no more than 200 ppm.
 

Electrodes (4 and 5) are spaced apart no more than 10 mm, so that 
with a 

lamp current at least 20 amperes, an arc of the electrode-stable type is 
formed and radiant light of Cd ions obtained. 
For the encapsulated rare gas, in one embodiment at least one of the 
rare 

gases neon, argon or krypton, are used and are encapsulated at a gas 
pressure of 35 kPa to 2.5 MPa at a standard temperature of 25° C. 

In another embodiment, a halogen gas is encapsulated in the 
arc in an amount from 4.5 x 10⁻¹⁰ mol/cm³ of arc tube 

volume to 2.1 x 10⁻⁷ mol/cm³ of arc tube volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cadmium/rare gas discharge lamp of the 
short arc type in which cadmium, halogen and rare gas contribute to a discharge 
emission. The invention relates in particular to a cadmium/rare gas 
discharge lamp of the short arc type that is suited for light sources of 
optical devices in which ultraviolet rays are used. The invention further relates to a cadmium/rare gas discharge lamp 
of the short arc type that emits light corresponding to ion lines in a C-range, i.e., a wavelength range of less than or equal to 250 nm, with high energy 
exchange efficiency, and the light corresponding to ion lines is ultraviolet rays of 
cadmium ions. As is known, optical devices in which ultraviolet rays are used are 
widely used for industrial applications such as for reforming plastic 
surfaces, for photo chemical vapour deposition (PCVD), for photo-incineration,  
 
for UV curing in which a certain wavelength is needed, for 
photolithography and for similar purposes. When using light in a wavelength of 185 nm to 300 nm, it is usually 
desired to use a metal/rare gas discharge lamp such as a xenon-mercury 
lamp or a xenon cadmium lamp. It is purported that, when using light in 
particular in a wavelength of 220 ± 20 nm, a xenon/cadmium discharge 
lamp is suitable, as, for example, it can be concluded from Japanese laid-open 
specification SHO 55-10757 entitled "Cadmium/rare Gas Discharge 
Lamp of the Short Arc Type." In Japanese laid-open specification SHO 55-10757, it is pointed out 
that, by determining the encapsulation amount of cadmium and rare gas, 
radiation in a wavelength around 220 nm can be intensified, which can 
shorten the heat curing time in a production operation of a semiconductor 
device. Emission spectra of a cadmium lamp in a wavelength range of 210 
nm to 230 nm are achieved because of a subtle balance of the density 
distribution of cadmium atoms, ions and molecules that are in 
a ground state. To achieve a needed form of the spectra it is therefore 
necessary to achieve a suitable density and a suitable vapour pressure by 
controlling an encapsulation amount of cadmium. The cadmium vapour 
pressure inside a discharge space is, on the other hand, very strongly 
influenced by the temperature of the coolest part of the arc tube in a 
lighting operation. As a result of this, the temperature of the coolest part 
also exerts a strong influence on the distribution of emission spectra. The propagation of band spectra of Cd2 that contain, because of a 
certain encapsulation
