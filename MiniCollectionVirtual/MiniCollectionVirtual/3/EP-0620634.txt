<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid excitation type permanent magnet synchronous 
motor is provided with an armature (1) and a rotor core (12) arranged to 

be rotated relative to the armature (1). Permanent magnets are 
installed to the rotor core (12) and generates magnetic flux which 

passes through the armature (1) through a gap between the rotor 
and armature. Salient pole portions are integral with the rotor 

core and not covered with the permanent magnets. The salient 
pole portions (12a) are arranged opposite to the armature (1) through gap 

such that the magnetic flux by the permanent magnets is effected 
by the magnetic flux passing through the salient pole portions. A 

direct current excitation coil (5) generates the magnetic flux passing 
through the salient pole portions (12a). Therefore, an operable speed 

area of the motor is increased without using the demagnetization 
control and without degrading the efficiency. Also a damper coil 

(17, see fig. 13) may be installed to the salient pole portions (12a). 
Another embodiment (see fig. 26) comprises a rotor with permanet magnets 

(13) attached on the whole surface of the rotor. The different poles and 
salient pole portions interlock (see fig. 28). A further embodiment (see 

fig. 33) is made like a pancake.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in a permanent 
magnet motor, and more particularly to a hybrid excitation 
type permanent magnet motor according to the preamble 
of claim 1. Various types of permanent magnet (PM) motors have been 
proposed and in practical use. For example, in a typical PM 
motor provided with a three-phase coil as an armature at a stator 
side, a rotor is formed by attaching permanent magnets 200 on a 
field core 100 as shown in Fig. 34A, or is formed by embedding 
the permanent magnets 200 into the field core 100 as shown in 
Fig. 34B. With these types of motors, the magnetic flux by the 
permanent magnet 200 is determined by the permiance of the 
property of the permanent magnet 200 and a magnetic circuit, 
and is kept constant without being affected by a rotation speed of 
the motor. Accordingly, an induced voltage by an armature coil 
is increased in proportion with the rotation speed. When a 
terminal voltage, which is the sum of the induced voltage and a 
first impedance drop, corresponds with the maximum value of 
the electric source voltage, the rotation speed at this time 
becomes a maximum rotation speed. In case that such a motor 
implements a power-constant operation by keeping the power 
source voltage constant, as a method for broadening operable 
speed area of the motor by raising the maximum rotation speed, 
a so-called demagnetization control has been proposed, in which 
an electric current is applied to an armature coil for canceling the 
magnetic flux of the permanent magnet 200, in order to 
equivalently reduce induced voltage. Fig. 35 shows a 
characteristic curve obtained from such a demagnetization 
control. Although it is commonly known that the permanent magnet 
motor is operated at a high efficiency since no excitation input is  
 
required, the permanent magnet motor employing the 
demagnetization control causes a problem that the efficiency is 
lowered if the constant-output area is broadened, as shown in 
Fig. 35. Further, the electric current for the demagnetization is 
required even under no-load condition. A hybrid excitation type permanent magnet synchronous motor 
according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from document 
EP-A-228 873. In this known motor, particular means and an 
A. C. electric power source are needed for changing the direction 
of the magnetic flux. The object of the present invention is to omit the need of 
particular means of an A.C. electric power source for 
changing the direction of the magnetic flux. This
