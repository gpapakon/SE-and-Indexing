<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
elements containing both a particular class of color 
couplers and stabilizers that are particularly 
effective with the foregoing class. Color photographic elements typically contain 
several records each with silver halide sensitized to a 
different region of the visible light spectrum. 
Generally, one record is sensitized to red light, 
another green light and another, blue light. Each of 
the foregoing records also contains a color coupler 
which reacts with oxidized developer during processing 
of the element, to produce a dye in a pattern 
corresponding to the image to which the element was 
exposed. In a typical element the red, green and blue 
sensitive records respectively contain a cyan dye 
forming coupler, a magenta dye forming coupler and a 
yellow dye forming coupler. As to the colour couplers, these are known to 
belong to a number of classes, for example magenta dye-forming 
couplers can be pyrazolones, pyrazolotriazoles 
and pyrazolobenzimidazoles while yellow dye-forming 
couplers can be acetanilides. European Patent 
Specification 0 431 374 A describes β,γ-unsaturated 
nitriles as cyan colour couplers of the general 
formula: 
R2-V=C(R1)-CH(W)-CN  
 
wherein 
W is hydrogen or an atom or group 
capable of being released when the compound is 
subjected to a coupling reaction with oxidised product 
of an aromatic primary amine derivative and is attached 
to a carbon atom having an sp3 electronic 
configuration, R1 is a substituent, V is nitrogen or -C(R3)= , if V represents nitrogen, R2 represents a 
substituent, if V represents -C(R3)= , R2 and R3 each 
represent a substituent, provided that at least one of 
R2 and R3 represent an electron attractive substituent, 
and provided that if R2 or R3 represents an aliphatic 
group or an aromatic group, the other does not 
represent an acyl group, and R1 and R2 may bond together to form a ring. The couplers of the above general formula are 
said to have less subsidiary absorption in the blue 
region of the spectrum. In support of this contention 
one drawing (Fig 1) and a table of data are provided 
wherein the dye formed from Coupler 53 is compared to 
that from Comparative Compound (1) - a phenolic 
coupler. The color couplers used in the photographic 
elements of the present invention, as described below, 
are distinct from those of European Specification 
0 431 374A because, inter alia, the coupling position 
is a carbon atom having an sp2 electronic configuration 
and the compounds are
