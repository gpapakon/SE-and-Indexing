<ABSTRACT>
A device 10 for pressing objects 14, for example tablets or 
capsules, from receptacles 13 in a blister pack has a lower 

portion 21 for resting on a support and an upper portion 24 
hinged at 25 and including a channel 32 for guiding one side of 

a blister pack which rests on a rib 33. If a tab 28 is pressed 
down a boss 30 pushes the object through the sheet 11 of the 

pack into an open-topped receiver section defined by wall 27. 
The device 10 can then be moved to transfer the object 14 to a 

user's mouth. The device may be useful for the elderly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for pressing objects from 
blister packs. According to this invention a device for pressing an object 
from a receptacle in a blister pack comprises first and second 
portions connected for movement towards and away from each 
other, the first portion including a press member, the second 
portion comprising a receiver for receiving an object pressed 
from a receptacle by the press member, the receiver having an 
inlet for the object and an upwardly facing outlet further from 
the press member than the inlet. The receiver may comprise an aperture provided with a 
peripheral wall extending away from the first and second 
portions. The portions may provide guide means for a blister pack. The guide means may comprise a channel movable with the 
second portion for receiving an edge of the pack. The first portion may have a flat surface remote from the 
second portion for resting on a support surface. The first and second portions may comprise elongate members 
hinged at one end, and the second portion includes a press 
section which can be pressed to move the portions towards each 
other, the press section being further from the one end than the 
press member and the receiver. The invention may be performed in various ways and one 
specific embodiment with possible modifications will now be 
described by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Fig, 1 is a perspective view of a device associated with a 
blister pack;  Fig. 2 is a section on the line 2 - 2 of Fig. 1; and Fig. 3 is similar to Fig. 2 but with the device in a 
different operating condition. Fig, 4 is a perspective view of another example of a 
device; The device 10 is for use in pressing an object from a so-called 
blister in a blister pack. A blister pack is known and 
typically is in the form of a flat sheet 11 of deformable 
material, for example thin metal foil, and another sheet 12, for 
example of plastics, shaped to provide a plurality of pockets or 
recesses 13. Objects 14 are placed in the pockets 13, the 
so-called blisters, and the sheet 11 is placed over the sheet 12 
to close the pockets 13 and is adhered to the sheet 12 in the 
areas 15 between the pockets 13. In the arrangement shown in a 
pack 18 of objects the pockets 13 form two parallel rows 16, 17 
with the pockets 13 equi-spaced in each row. The objects 14 may for example be pills, tablets or 
capsules containing medicament e.g. pharmaceutical items. For someone who is infirm, perhaps as a result of age, or
