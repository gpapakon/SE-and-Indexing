<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of hyperimmune milk derived from milk producing animals hyperimmunized with bacterial antigens including intestinal bacteria. The administration of the present hyperimmune milk to an animal effectively retards physiological aging, increases longevity, delays the onset of physiological aging and restores physiological functional capacity in physiologically or chronologically aged animals. More specifically, the present hyperimmune milk is administered to an animal in an amount sufficient to effectively retard physiological aging, increase longevity, delay the onset of physiological aging in animals, or restore decreased physiological functional capacity in physiologically or chronologically aged animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title of the InventionThe Use Of Hyperimmune Milk To Increase LongevityThis application is a Continuation-in-part application of U.S. Application No. 07/899,519, filed on June 16, 1992 which is fully incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to the use of hyperimmune milk for retarding physiological aging, increasing longevity, delaying the onset of physiological aging in animals, and restoring physiological functional capacity in physiologically or chronologically aged animals.Background of the InventionAging is characterized by a decline of the organism's ability to adapt to, or otherwise overcome, environmental stresses. There is some evidence that aging in individuals is marked by a decline in normal immune cell functions (Makinodan et al. , Adv. Immunol. 29:287-330 (1980); Wade et al. ,Adv. Immunol. 36:143-188 (1984)) and that the decline is due to a decreased level of other changes in the heterogenous lymphoid cell population. (Bocci, V., Biol. Rev, 56:68 (1981)). Biochemically, the deterioration of the immune system with aging is measured by demonstrating decreases in the thymic lymphatic mass (Hirokawa et al., Clin. Immunol. & Immunopathol.24:251-262 (1982)); decreases in the proliferative response of spleen cells to mitogenic or alloantigenic stimulation (Chandra, R.K., Immunol. 67: 141-147 (1989); Adler et al., J. Immunol. 707:1357-1362 (1971)) and a decrease in the frequency of the occurrence of anti-sheep erythrocyte (SRBC antibody in the 

spleen after immunization with SRBC (Price et al., J. Immunol. 708:413-417 (1972)). This effect of age is termed immunological senescence. The above noted changes in immunological functions, associated with aging, predispose the subject to the onset of various medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, tumors, and life-threatening infections (Wade et al. , Adv. Immunol.36:143-188 (1984); Bocci, V., Biol. Rev. 56:68 (1981)).Dietary manipulation have been proposed as treatments for the prevention or restoration of the above age-related changes in immunological functions (Chandra, R.K., Immunol. 77:U\-U1 (1989); Kubo et al. . Nutr. 774:1884-1899(1984); Gabrielsen et al., Nature 264:439-440 (1976)) and cell grafting (Hirokawa et al. , Clin. Immunol. & Immunopathol. 24:251-262 (1982); Price et aL, J. Immunol. 708:413-417 (1972). However, further studies suggested that dietary manipulation only slightly decreased life threatening risks associated with aging (Chandra, R.K., Immunol. 67:141-147 (1989)).In

WHAT IS NEW AND CLAIMED AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED BY LETTERS PATENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS:
1. A method for retarding physiological aging in an animal, comprising: administering to said animal an amount of hyperimmune milk sufficient to effectively retard said physiological aging in said animal, wherein said hyperimmune milk is prepared from a milk-producing animal immunized with an intestinal-bacteria-containing vaccine.
2. A method for increasing the longevity of an animal, comprising: administering to said animal an amount of hyperimmune milk sufficient to effectively increase the longevity of said animal, wherein said hyperimmune milk is prepared from a milk-producing animal immunized with an intestinal-bacteria-containing vaccine.
3. A method for delaying the onset of physiological aging in an animal, comprising: administering to said animal an amount of hyperimmune milk sufficient to effectively delay the onset of said physiological aging in said animal, wherein said hyperimmune milk is prepared from a milk-producing animal immunized with an intestinal-bacterial-containing vaccine.
4. A method for restoring declining physiological functional capacity in an animal, comprising: administering to said animal an amount of hyperimmune milk sufficient to effectively restore said declining physiological functional capacity in said animal, wherein said hyperimmune milk is prepared from a milk- producing animal immunized with an intestinal -bacteria-containing vaccine. 


 5. The method of any one of claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein said hyperimmune milk is administered orally.
6. The method of any one of claims 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein said animal is human.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein said hyperimmune milk is in the form of a skim milk powder and is administered in an amount of from about 1 to about 200 g/kg body weight per day.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein said amount is from about 5 to about 150 g/kg body weight per day.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein said amount is about 98g/kg body weight per day.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein said hyperimmune milk is administered for about 14 days.
