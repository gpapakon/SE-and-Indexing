<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to computing devices and specifically to a hand-held
computing deviceComputer systems have gradually been reduced in size so that the power of a
computer system that once filled a room can now be made to fit in the palm of a hand.
However, with this miniaturization of computing power comes new problems in interfacing
with the computer system when the computer system resides in a very small package.In large scale, or "mainframe," computer systems human interfacing with the
computer was achieved by a variety of means. These included front panel switches, card
readers, paper tape, computer terminals, light pens, and other means Several operators were
required to maintain the system for dozens or even hundreds of users. Today, personal
computers provide computer systems dedicated to one or a few users Interfacing with a
personal computer is typically by means of a typewriter-style keyboard and "mouse". Other
personal computer input/output ("I/O") devices are available such as touch screens, digitizing
tablets, microphone and speaker, joy stick, trackball, etc. Currently, "virtual reality" related
types of I/O devices are available for personal computers such as head-mounted stereoscopic
viewing goggles or a data glove.A step down in size from a personal computer is a "laptop" or "notebook" computer
Laptop computers typically use a compact keyboard for input and a flat-panel display screen for
output. Some laptops use a small "track ball" or a movable key on the keyboard as an
additional input means for moving a cursor on the display. Other input devices may be
connected to the laptop computerWhen a computer system is made small enough to be held in a single hand, the above
I/O devices are, for the most part, undesirable or impossible to use. This is because the user no
longer has complete use of both hands for inputing information. For example, the traditional
typewriter keyboard is hard to implement well in a hand-held computer since it requires the
use of the fingers of both hands to operate it efficiently and since it requires a substantial area
for the placement of all of the keys onto a solid surface. In a handheld computer, not only is
the size of the unit itself smaller than that required tor the keyboard, but the user only has one
tree hand to manipulate an input device with the other hand (holding the computer) having
very limited movement. This is a distinct disadvantage in the design of input devices for hand-held
computers since the efficient entry of
