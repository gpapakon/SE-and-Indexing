<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of PC Cards such as mass storage systems,
particularly a solid state mass storage system or memory package known as a PC card.PCMCIA Cards, or PC Cards, are add-on devices about the size of a credit card, in
length and width, but thicker. PC Cards slide into PCMCIA slots in computers. PC Cards
come in several thicknesses, depending on application, which include memory upgrades,
modems, network connectors, or even hard disk drives. At present, PC Cards are known as
Type I, Type II and Type III. These three cards all have 68 pin connectors at the end and
are of the same length and width; but they differ in height or thickness. Type I cards
generally contain software programs or extra memory. Type II cards typically house
modems (e.g., data and fax) and network adapters. Type III cards are thick enough to
accommodate removable hard disk drives and wireless communication devices. It is
conceivable that in the future even thicker cards, i.e., Type IV and higher designations,
may be introduced.The term flash card, "PC card", "memory card", "PC Card" and "PCMCIA Card"
will be used interchangeably herein. PC card memory packages or mass storage systems
currently exist which are compatible with PCMCIA standards. Such PC card units are
available from Sundisk Corporation of Santa Clara, California. These existing PC card
units from Sundisk have a plastic frame in which a memory card is retained. A plastic
connector houses metallic pins which extend from the rear of the connector. The
rearwardly facing pins are soldered directly to printed circuit lines on the memory card and
the connector is loosely retained in notches in the frame. The frame and memory card are
sandwiched between layers of insulating material and stainless steel outer covers on
opposite sides of the frame and memory card. The stainless steel outer covers are bonded
to the plastic frame by adhesive. The outer surface of the frame adjacent the connector has
a keyway which complements a shoulder on the slot in the computer to ensure that the PC
card is inserted in the right orientation. If an attempt is made to insert the card upside
down, interference between the shoulder on the slot and the keyway structure on the card
will prevent full insertion of the card into the slot.EP 0 546 680 discloses a circuit card that has a circuit module including a circuit
board, an electrical connector connected to the circuit board and a plastic perimeter frame 
carrying the circuit board and the electrical connector. A
