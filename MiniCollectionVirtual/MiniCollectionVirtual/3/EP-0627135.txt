<ABSTRACT>
Device for controlling electric motors of the asynchronous motor type operated by means of three-phase alternating current. For producing the operating current of the motor (5) a voltage-controlled oscillator (2) is foreseen and a generator (4, 6) controlled by the same and conditionally fed from a direct current source (1). The control device (3, 7, 8) is arranged to receive the pulse which arises upon operation of the motor (5) in its feed conductors (10-12) for alternating current and is thereby arranged to detect changes in the pulse shape of the operating voltage which occur due to electromotive forces induced from the motor windings when these are passed by the induced field of the rotor. These changes vary with the size of the slip. On the basis of the level of said deviations, a proportional voltage is induced which is transferred to the oscillator for its frequency control. With changes in the rotational torque loading on the motor, the control voltage is thereby changed and also the frequency of the oscillator and consequently the rotational speed of the motor, so that an adaptation to the operating resistance is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control devices for
electric motors according to the preamble of claim 1. The
control device is intended to control the output of the
motor depending on the applied load. The device is arranged
to achieve this control in an electrical way by means of an
electronic circuit.There are a number of types of electric motor which operate
according to varying principles and which have different
constructions and control means. A current important type
of motor is intended to function with current from a direct
current source; this often concerning vehicle equipment or
motors in mobile equipment such as battery-operated tools.For direct operation with direct current, commutator motors
having brush-commutation or electronic type commutation can
be used. These motors are however relatively expensive to
produce since they have both stator windings as well as
rotor windings, added to which comes the commutator circuit
if no brush commutator is used which in turn gives a
limited operation time between servicing. Thus a different
type of motor driven via an alternating current transformer
has been used increasingly, namely synchronous motors often
with permanent magnets. Even these motors are however
relatively expensive to produce and, for certain purposes,
do not allow adequate regulation.Asynchronous motors with short-circuited rotors have
achieved very widespread use for alternating current 
operation. This has occurred because the type of motor is
robust and, above all, cheap to produce since the rotor
with its single short-circuited windings requires very
little work.With an asynchronous motor the field is produced in the
short-circuited rotor by means of the rotating field of the
stator which is formed by using three-phase power or which
respectively can be produced by using single-phase along
with the provision of auxiliary circuits. In order for this
to occur, a certain slip of the rotor with respect to its
synchronism with the stator field is required, so that this
passes the short-circuited windings of the rotor. A greater
produced torque requires a greater induced field in the
rotor, which arises since the larger the load, the larger
slip. With very large slip the torque development starts to
decrease with the risk that the motor will fall out and
stop. Such low torque development can also occur at the
start, the asynchronous motor having a low starting torque
from rest. These characteristics and limitations have
resulted in the fact that the motor has achieved only
limited

<CLAIMS>
Device for control of electric motors of the asynchronous
motor type operated by means of three-phase

alternating current, which creates a rotating magnetic
field in the motor which induces a field upon a certain

rotational speed slip from synchronous rotational speed in
the rotor, thus giving the required field for the rotation

of the rotor, whereby for producing the operating current
of the motor (5) there is arranged an oscillator (2) and a

generator (4, 6) for the alternating voltages, frequency-controlled
by said oscillator and conditionally fed from a

direct current source (1), and that, for the oscillator
(2), a type is used which has its output frequency defined

by the level of an input control voltage (at 15), whereby
the control device (3, 7, 8) is arranged to receive the

pulse which arises during operation of the motor (5) in its
feed conductors (10-12) for alternating current, and is

thereby arranged to detect changes in pulse shape of the
operating voltage which occur due to electromotive forces

induced from the motor windings when these are passed by
the induced field of the rotor, said changes varying in

size according to the size of the slip, and to induce a
proportional voltage based on the level of said changes,

said voltage being transferred to the oscillator (2) for
its frequency control, whereby with changes in the

rotational torque loading of the motor, said control
voltage is changed and the oscillator's frequency and

thereby the motor's rotational speed is changed, so that
adaptation to the operating resistance is achieved, characterized in that

the control device comprises a comparator (3) which is
arranged to transform the level of change from the operating 

voltage to a pulse train of pulses whose length is
varied proportionally with the changed voltage level, said

pulse train being transformed in a control device of the
transformer (8) into a direct current, the voltage of which

is dependent on the length of the pulses and which is
conducted further to the oscillator (2) for controlling of

the same.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that between the comparator (3) and the
transformer (8) a separator is connected for separation of

the length-varying pulses (22, 23) which determine the
slip, from other pulses in the signal from the comparator

(3).
