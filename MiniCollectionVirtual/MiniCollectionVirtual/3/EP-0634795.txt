<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor circuit integrated with CMOS circuits for receiving a TTL input voltage 
and generating a large negative and positive voltage swing with respect to p-type or n-type substrate 

is disclosed. A PMOS negative and positive voltage swing circuit (50) can be integrated with CMOS 
circuits. The discrete transistor (12; Fig. 1) and the discrete resistor (14; Fig. 1) are replaced by two 

PMOS transistors (52) and (54). In this circuit the source (56) of the PMOS transistor (52) is connected 
to a positive voltage (+ V
SS)
, the gate (58) of the PMOS transistor (52) is connected to the input 
voltage (V₁)and the drain (60) of the PMOS transistor (52) is connected to the source (62) of the PMOS 

transistor (54). In order to have the transistor (54) function as an active resistor, its gate (64) is 

connected to its drain (66) and the drain (66) is connected to a negative voltage (-V
DD
). By connecting 
the gate (64) of the PMOS transistor (54) to its drain (66), the PMOS transistor (54) acts as an active 

resistor. This invention is based on elimination of the electro-static discharge (ESD) protection circuit 
which is a requirement for any integrated circuit Eliminating the ESD protection circuit also 

eliminates the clamping feature of the ESD protection circuit and therefore the circuit can be driven 
to negative voltages for PMOS circuits and to positive voltages for NMOS circuits. This provides the 

possibility of connecting the drain of a a P-channel type metal oxide silicon field effect (PMOS) 
transistor, which is fabricated on a p-type substrate within an n-well, to a voltage below the the 

substrate voltage. Also, in a n-channel type metal oxide silicon field effect (NMOS) transistor which is 
fabricated on a n-type substrate within a P-well, the drain can be connected to voltages higher than 

the substrate voltage. Utilizing this feature of a MOS transistor provides a way to design an 
integrated circuit which can handle negative voltage swings as well as positive voltage swings.
