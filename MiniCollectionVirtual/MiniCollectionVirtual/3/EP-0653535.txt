<ABSTRACT>
The multi-bolt lock has a latch (3) and a bolt (4) actuable by a driver (16) on the lock cylinder (17). The lock has first transmission means (23, 25) connected operatively to the bolt (4) and detente means (28) for locking the latch (3), with the bolt moved out, and thus providing additional security. In the preferred version, the lock has a coupling member (33) which acts on a slide (8) attached to the latch shank (9), and, when the lock is screwed together ready, action can be taken on this coupling member from outside through an orifice in the lock case, in order to pull out the latch (3) together with the shank (9) and reverse it through 180 DEG , in such a way that the lock can be used both for left-closing and for right-closing doors. Such a lock affords increased security and allows efficient production and installation.

A lock, more particularly a multiple bolt lock, comprising 

a spring (41) loaded latch (3) having an associated 
latch shaft (9), said latch being actuatable both by 

a latchkey (5) having a nut (6) and by a lock cylinder 
(17) having a dog (16), said latch shaft (9) being provided 

with a driver which cooperates with a nose (7) of 
said nut (6), 
a bolt (4) which is actuatable by said dog (16) of 
said lock cylinder (17), 
a sliding plate (25) which is coupled to said bolt 
(4) and disposed in parallel to the lock plate (2), 


first means which are coupled to said sliding 
plate (25) for the purpose of blocking said latch (3), 

and 
second means for the purpose of uncoupling the 
positive connection between said latchkey (5) and said 

latch (3), 
 
   characteri
zed by 

a U-shaped releasing plate (33) which is arranged 
in a vertically displaceable manner und whose shanks 

(34, 35) are disposed above one another and approximately 
horizontally, 
by third means which are coupled to said sliding 
plate (25), for the purpose of lifting and depressing 

said releasing plate (33) in accordance with the position 
of said sliding plate (25), and 
by a driver in the form of a coupler (8) which is 
positively connected to said latch shaft (9) in the longitudinal 

direction of the latter and displaceable 
transversally thereto and which is guided between said 

shanks (34, 35) of said releasing plate (33), in such a 
manner that said nut (6) which is actuatable by said  

 
latchkey is disengaged from said coupler (8) when the 

bolt (4) is shot. 
Lock according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said third means comprise a slider lever (31) which is 

rigidly journalled on a journal which is fastened to the 
lock case and displaceable on a pin which is connected 

to said sliding plate (25), said slider lever (31) acting 
upon the lower shank (34) of said releasing plate 

(33). 
Lock according to claim 2, characterised in that 
said third means further comprise a spring (36) which 

acts upon the upper shank (35) against the action of 
said slider lever (31). 
Lock according to claim 2, further charcterised by 

a safety lever (37) whose free leg (53) movably 
obturates an associated opening (54) in the wall of the 

lock case, the nose (38) disposed on its other leg being 
in engagement with said coupler (8), 
by two slots (42, 43) in the lock plate (2), for 
the guidance of the shoulders (44) of the latch (3), and 
by a rotatable connection between the latch (3) 
and the latch shaft (9). 
Lock according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said first means comprise a spring-loaded catch lever 

(28) which is connected to said sliding plate (25) by a 
pin (29) and is disposed in such a manner that, according 

to the position of the latch (3), it is either insertable 
behind the latter or applied to the underside 

thereof by spring action.  
 
A method for the conversion of a lock according to 
claim 4 for its selective use with doors hung left or 

right, characterised in that 

first, by means of its free leg (53), the nose 
(38) of said safety lever (37) is disengaged from the 

coupler (8) using an auxiliary tool (40), 
secondly, said releasing plate (33) is lifted by 
its upper shank (35) until the nose (7) of the nut (6) 

is disengaged from the coupler (8), 
after having withdrawn the latch (3) from the lock 
plate (2), in the third place, the latch is rotated 180° 

around said rotatable connection on account of the force 
of the latch spring (41), and 
in the fourth place, the latch (3) is completely 
pushed back into the lock plate (2), the releasing plate 

(33) is relieved, and said safety lever (37) is returned 
to its rest position.
