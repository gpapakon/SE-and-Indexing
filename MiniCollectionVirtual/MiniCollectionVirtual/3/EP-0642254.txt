<ABSTRACT>
An original or a photosensitive film is held by a sheet 
holder and the sheet holder is fixed to the drum of an image 

reading scanner or an image recording scanner by a row of hooks 
planted on the drum. A row of holes corresponding to the row of 

hooks are formed at each of the opposing ends of the sheet 
holder. A hook is composed of: a stem, a lever rotatably 

attached with a pin to the stem, and a plate urged upward by a 
spring against the bottom of the lever. A plane is formed at a 

side of the bottom of the lever. First the levers of the hooks 
are raised upright and the holes of an end of the sheet holder 

are engaged with the hooks. After surrounding the drum with the 
sheet holder, the holes at the other end of the sheet holder are 

engaged with the hooks and the levers are turned to a lying 
position, where the levers are stable because the plate is urged 

upward against the side plane of the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for fixing a sheet
on a drum of a scanner.In a drum type image reading scanner, an original is fixed
on a surface of the drum of the image reading scanner and the
image of the original is read by moving a reading head along the
axis of the drum while the drum is rotated. In a drum type image
recording scanner, a photosensitive film is fixed on a surface
of the drum and an image is recorded on the photosensitive film
by moving a recording head along the axis of the drum while the
drum is rotated. That is, those drum type image reading scanner
and drum type image recording scanner use similar drum scanning
mechanisms.For reading or recording an accurate image, it is important
in these drum scanning mechanisms to securely fix the original
sheet or the recording sheet on the drum and to prevent it from
moving while the drum rotates.Various sheet fixing mechanisms have been devised so far for
that purpose. One is shown in the Publication of the Japanese
Examined Utility Model Application No. S59-18778 in which, as
shown in Fig. 6 of the Publication, an original 23 is inserted
between a pair of transparent sheets 25 and 26 of a sheet holder
24, and the sheet holder 24 is fixed on the drum surface as shown
in Fig. 7 of the Publication. For fixing the sheet holder 24 on
the drum surface, a row of holes 29 and 30 are made at either end 
of the sheet holder 24, and a row of fixed pins 15 and a row of
movable nails 18 corresponding to the holes 30 and 29 of the
sheet holder 24 are formed on neighboring generatrix lines of the
drum surface. By operating a lever 22 provided at an end of the
drum, all the movable nails 18 sink down from the drum surface,
and by releasing the lever 22, the movable nails 18 rise up on
the drum surface. An original is fixed on the drum surface as
follows. First the original 23 is inserted in the sheet holder
24. The holes 30 at one end of the sheet holder 24 are engaged
with the fixed pins 15, and the sheet holder 24 is turned around
the drum. While operating the lever 22, the other end of the
sheet holder 24 is located over the sinking nails 18, and the
lever 22 is released for raising the nails 18 to engage with the
holes 29 of the other end.In the above sheet fixing mechanism, one end and the other
end of a sheet holder 24 engage with a row of fixed pins 15 and
a row of movable nails 18, respectively. That is, two rows of
engaging members must exist on the drum surface, which decreases
the surface area of the drum that can hold an original

A sheet fixing device for fixing a sheet on a drum (10)
of a drum type scanner, the sheet having a length corresponding

to the circumference of the drum (10), the sheet fixing
device comprising:


a) a plurality of stems (12, 45) standing on the
surface of the drum (10);
b) a lever (13, 40) rotatably attached to each of the
plurality of stems (12, 45), the lever (13, 40)

being rotatable between an upright position and a
lying position; and
c) a stabilizer provided with each of the plurality of
stems (12, 45) and with each of the levers (13, 40) for stabilizing

the lever (13, 40) at the lying position.
The sheet fixing device according to claim 1, wherein the
sheet fixing device further comprises a sheet holder (14) for

holding the sheet and having a row of holes (17, 18) at each
of opposing ends of the sheet holder (14). 
The sheet fixing device according to claim 2, wherein the
lever (13, 40) is attached with a pin (27, 42) to each of the

plurality of stems (12, 45), the lever (13, 40) has a plane
(13c) which is essentially parallel to the extension of the

stems (12, 45), when the lever (13, 40) is in the upright position,
and which is substantially perpendicular to the extension

of the stems (12, 45) when the lever (13, 40) is in the
lying position, and the stabilizer comprises a plate (21, 22; 43) placed

under the lever and a spring (23; 44) for urging the plate to the plane
(13c) when the lever (13, 40) is in the lying position.
The sheet fixing device according to claim 3, wherein the
lever (13, 40) has an L-shaped hole (41) for admitting the pin

(42), an arm of the L-shaped hole (41) being directed to the
plane (13c), whereby the pin drops into the arm when the lever

(13, 40) is in the lying position and was displaced in a direction
substantially perpendicular to the extension of the

stems (12, 45).
The sheet fixing device according to claim 3 or 4,
wherein a rotating direction of the lever (13, 40) is oblique

to a rotating direction of the drum (10).
The sheet fixing device according to claim 3 or 4,
wherein the lever (40) has a corner cut extending from the

plane (13c) to a bottom plane (13a) of the lever (40), the cut
resulting in an additional plane to which the plate (43) is urged

by the spring (44), thereby realizing a intermediate stable
position of the lever (40) between the upright position

and the lying position.
