<ABSTRACT>
An electrode-carrying catheter (10) comprises elongate, 
flexible tubing (12) defining a proximal end (14), a distal end 

(16), and an electrically insulative outer tubular layer (20) 
intermediate the ends, the tubing including a flexible 

electrically-conductive core (42) of wire and a flexible non-conductive 
core-covering layer (44) of plastic about the core. 

At least one electrically-conductive ring electrode (30a) is 
crimped on and flush with the outer surface of the tubing. In 

order to conduct electrical signals between the proximal end (14) 
and each of the ring electrodes (30a), a longitudinally-spaced 

plurality of flexible electrically-conductive wires (45) are 
helically wound around and at least partially into the core-covering 

layer (44). The wound wires (45) each has an exposed 
section (47) beneath a segment of each of the ring electrodes 

(30a). An electrically-conductive flexible flat ribbon (51) is 
disposed intermediate each of the ring electrodes (30) and the 

tubing, each ribbon being electrically and physically joined to 
a respective one of the wound wires (45) and wrapped about the 

outer tubular surface (20), and each of the ring electrodes being 
crimped onto a respective one of the ribbons and the outer 

tubular surface. 
An end electrode (30b) may be crimped on the distal end 
(16) of the tubing (12), in electrical contact with an extension 

(42a) of the wire core (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrode-carrying 
catheters, and more particularly to an inexpensive and reliable 
electrode-carrying catheter and a method of making the same. Electrode-carrying catheters are well known in the 
medical art and find diagnostic and therapeutic utility in a 
wide variety of different applications. For example, mapping 
catheters are used diagnostically to produce a wave function of 
the heart's electrical impulses so that a doctor can determine 
proper functioning or fault, and location of the fault, in the 
heart. Ablative catheters are used therapeutically to destroy 
tissue in the heart causing tachycardia, utilizing radio 
frequency current catheter ablation. Such catheters are also 
used for heart pacing purposes and for analgesia in various 
parts of the body. Depending upon the particular application 
for which the catheter is used, it may be desirable for the 
catheter to carry one or more side electrodes, one or more end 
electrodes, or a combination thereof. The use of a plurality 
of smaller electrodes rather than a single large electrode 
enables higher current densities to be obtained and frequently 
enables superior electrical contact with the tissue, both of 
these being highly desirable factors in connection with 
ablative catheters in particular, where larger areas of radio 
frequency ablation in the tissue are desirable.  
 Electrically conductive wires have never proven to be 
entirely satisfactory as the electrodes, since a functional 
electrode requires a much larger surface area than can be 
provided by a flexible wire. Further, unless provisions are 
made to fix the wire relative to the catheter tubing, it is 
extremely difficult to ensure that the wire is held in place so 
as to assure a reliable electrical contact. While a wire could 
be held in place by use of an electrically conductive adhesive 
securing the wire to the tubing, it would be extremely 
difficult to create an electrode by applying an adhesive in a 
thin layer over a large surface area, as would be necessary to 
ensure that the electrode layer is flexible. While a biocompatible conductive paint as an electrode 
has the advantage of being easily applied in an extremely thin 
layer to the tubing outer surface by printing techniques, so as 
to ensure flexibility thereof and cover the wire, there are 
other problems associated with such conductive paint. While 
the flexible, thin layer of conductive ink painted on the 
tubing outer surface forms a good electrical connection with 
the
