<ABSTRACT>
A longitudinal bearer for forming shelving designed 
for palletized loads, consisting of a metal profile (1), 

preferably of open cross section, whose end portions (4) 
are flattened such that they each define flat, transverse 

strips (5) on which the fixing elements are situated, 
said fixing elements consisting of kinked lugs (6), 

obtained by making U-shaped cuts, and end tabs (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a longitudinal 
bearer for forming shelving designed for palletized 
loads, consisting of a metal profile terminating in end 
heads provided with fixing elements. More particularly, the longitudinal bearer of the 
invention is designed for forming shelving made of vertical 
posts, longitudinal bearers and cross members, which 
are connected and linked together by means of screws, and 
elements for fixing the longitudinal bearers. Due to the 
heavy weights which such shelving has to support, all of 
the component parts must be extremely robust and connected 
solidly together. The longitudinal bearers for making this shelving 
consist of a metal profile with square angle bars welded  
 
perpendicularly to each of ends by means of one of their 
branches or wings, the free wing or branch of said angle 
bars being provided with kinked tabs, obtained by means 
of cuts, which constitute the fixing means. This constitution requires that the profiles be cut 
into sections of the right length, that the end heads be 
cut from square angle bar profiles, and that these heads 
be welded to the ends of the profile. All of these operations, 
in particular the that of welding, imply a considerable 
increase in cost of the manufacturing process. 
Furthermore, the welding process eliminates any protective 
coating which the metallic parts may have. The object of the present invention is a longitudinal 
bearer of the type described above, but constituted 
in such a way that the manufacturing operations or phases 
can be reduced, eliminating the welding operations, with 
all of the advantages that this implies. Firstly, the most costly operation is eliminated and 
as a result the longitudinal bearer can be obtained at a 
lower cost. Secondly, as there are no welding operations, they 
can be used to make longitudinal bearer profiles provided 
with a protective coating without the risk of said coating 
being destroyed. One advantage of the invention is that the risk of 
possible welding defects are eliminated which otherwise 
could cause the longitudinal bearers to break, allowing 
the load supported to collapse. The longitudinal bearer of the invention consists of 
a single profile which means it is possible to reduce the 
stocks of materials required as well as the number of 
cutting operations, and form the longitudinal bearer by  
 
means of a process which may be almost entirely automated, 
since the longitudinal bearer of the invention 
consists of a single piece at the ends of which the

<CLAIMS>
A longitudinal bearer for forming shelving designed 
for palletized loads, consisting of a metal profile 

(1), preferably of open cross section, which terminates 
in end heads provided with fixing elements, characterized 

in that said heads consist of flattened end portions (4) 
of the profile that define as many equal, flat, transverse 

strips (5) on which the fixing elements are situated, 
said fixing elements being obtained by the stamping 

of the strips (5) themselves. 
A longitudinal bearer according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fixing elements consist of 

intermediate kinked lugs (6), obtained by making U-shaped 
cuts in the flattened end portions (5), and end tabs (7), 

which protrude perpendicularly from the straight transverse 
edges of the profile (1), said lugs (6) pointing in 

a direction perpendicular to axis of the profile (1) and 
all of them towards the concave side thereof, such that 

their end sections are parallel to the flattened end 
portion (5); and said tabs (7) being L-shaped with their 

end sections pointing in the same direction as the end 
sections (9) of the intermediate lugs (6).
