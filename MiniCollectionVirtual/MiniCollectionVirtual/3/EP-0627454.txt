<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the use of copolyamides as hot-melt adhesives for heat-sealing, where at least 3 monomer components selected from the following group are copolymerised in the copolyamide: an equimolar mixture of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine (6,6-salt), laurolactam, 11-aminoundecanoic acid, an equimolar mixture of azelaic acid and hexamethylenediamine (6,9-salt), an equimolar mixture of sebacic acid and hexamethylenediamine (6,10-salt) and an equimolar mixture of dodecanedioic acid and hexamethylenediamine (6,12-salt), where the melting point of the copolyamide is below 140@C, and at least 10 % by weight of laurolactam and/or 11-aminoundecanoic acid are copolymerised.

The use of copolyamides as melt adhesives for heat sealing,

characterized in that

A) at least three of the following monomer components are copolymerized with
the copolyamide:
