<ABSTRACT>
CMOS technology high speed digital signal transceiver, in which the 
receiver has a clock signal extraction circuit, which is capable of self-aligning on 

incoming data with no spurious locks. Utilizing the PLL technique, the circuit 
generates a clock signal locked to the incoming signal utilizing a local oscillator, 

voltage-controlled by two feedback loops, a main one for frequency and phase 
corrections and a secondary one for phase correction. Moreover, original circuit 

solutions for the phase detectors and the low-pass filters are also envisaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the devices for electronic systems in 
which digital signals have to be exchanged between equipment located in places that 
are separated by some distance and in particular it refers to a high-speed, CMOS 
technology, digital signal transceiver, which can be realized as an integrated circuit 
on a single chip. It is well known that when digital signals in parallel form have to be 
transmitted at a certain distance, it is preferred to convert them in serial form so as 
to be able to utilize a single transmission line, instead of as many lines as are the 
bits of the parallel signal, for instance eight. The signal to be transmitted must 
furthermore be appropriately coded in order to minimize its sensitivity to any 
interference which may hake been collected by the transmission line and to enable 
the receiving apparatus to check the correctness of the received datum. Naturally, 
upon reception the signal has to be reconverted into the original form in order to 
be utilized. Digital signals to be transmitted, coded in a parallel mode and, generally, 
in NRZ (Non Return to Zero) format, must undergo a first coding of the 4B/5B 
type, which, by making a 5 bit block correspond with each 4 bit block, allows to 
enlarge the number of transitions of the transmitted signal. In particular, this coding  
 
guarantees the occurrence of at least one logic level transition for each 4 bits 
transmitted, avoiding the risk of a loss of synchronism of the receiving equipment in 
the presence of long stays at the same logic state. Moreover, the possible reception 
of one of the 16 not utilized 5-bit codes may be used for the detection of errors in 
the received signal. After the 4B/5B coding, the parallel signal has to be converted into series 
mode and into the NRZI (Non Return to Zero Inverted) format, adopted internationally. The NRZ/NRZI format converter causes the digital signal to be changed 
over between the two logic states, at the clock signal rate, when the NRZ signal 
remains at level one, whereas it causes it to stay at 0 or at 1 (depending on the last 
transition performed), when the NRZ signal is at logic state 0. In reception, it is necessary to read correctly the received data, extracting 
from them the clock signal for the detection, and thus perform the inverse conversion 
and decoding operation, checking for the presence of any possible transmission 
errors. The extraction of the clock signal is usually performed utilizing a PLL 
(Phase Locked Loop) circuit, which uses as
