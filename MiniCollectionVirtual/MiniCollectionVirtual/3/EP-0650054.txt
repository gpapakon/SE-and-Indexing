<ABSTRACT>
A process for obtaining and/or immunologically detecting an analyte present in a gas phase by immunological binding of the analyte to a binding partner of the analyte, which partner is contained in a first carrier matrix which is gas- and liquid-permeable, which is characterised in that   a) the analyte-containing gas phase is contacted with the first carrier matrix, b) the analyte is bound to the first binding partner which is contained in the first matrix and not bound to the matrix, c) the complex of analyte and first binding partner, and the free first binding partner are eluted from the first matrix, and d) the eluted complex or free first binding partner is isolated or determined as measure of the amount of analyte present.

Method of obtaining an analyte contained in a gas phase by immunologically
binding the analyte to a binding partner thereof contained in a gas and liquid-permeable

first carrier matrix, characterized in that

a) the analyte-containing gas phase is brought into contact with the first carrier
matrix (immune adsorber),
b) the analyte is bound to the first binding partner which is contained in the first
matrix and not bound to the matrix, and
c) the complex consisting of analyte and free first binding partner is eluted from
the first matrix, and
d) the analyte can be released from the complex.
Method of immunologically detecting an analyte contained in a gas phase by
immunologically binding the analyte to a binding partner thereof contained in a

gas- and liquid-permeable first carrier matrix, characterized in that

a) the analyte-containing gas phase is brought into contact with the first carrier
matrix (immune adsorber),
b) the analyte is bound to the first binding partner which is contained in the first
matrix and not bound to the matrix, and
c) the mixture consisting of complex of analyte and first binding partner and
free first binding partner is eluted from the first matrix
d) the eluted complex or free first binding partner is determined as a measure
for the amount of analyte present.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the first binding partner is
provided with a label, and the eluted label which is bound in the complex or not

bound is determined as a measure for the amount of analyte which is present. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the first binding partner is
unlabeled,


a) the eluted amount of first binding partner is bound to a labeled second
binding partner for the first binding partner
b) and the so bound label is determined as a measure for the amount of analyte
present.
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that the binding of the first binding
partner to the second binding partner is accomplished in a second carrier matrix

and the determination of the label in a third carrier matrix.
Method according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the immune adsorber has
a liquid content of 10 to 90 %.
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that, in a first step, the analyte is
nonspecifically adsorbed to an essentially dry matrix; in a second step, liquid is

added allowing the immune reaction between analyte and labeled binding partner
to occur.
Method according to claims 6 or 7, characterized in that the liquid is water with a
content of up to 30 wt.-% of organic substances as dissolving agents and/or

0.01 to 1 % detergent.
Device for obtaining and/or immunologically detecting an analyte contained in a
gas phase, comprising


a) a gas- and liquid-permeable carrier matrix in which a first binding partner of
the analyte is contained in elutable form,
b) a capture system for such an eluate in which the complex consisting of
analyte and first binding partner or nonbound first binding partner can be

determined or isolated in a subsequent reaction.
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that the carrier matrix has a gas
permeability of 10 ml/min up to 10 l/min.
