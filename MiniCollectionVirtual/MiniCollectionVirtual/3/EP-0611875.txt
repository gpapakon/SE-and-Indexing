<ABSTRACT>
Each boring (shaft-sinking) pipe (1) includes:   - a metal inner tube (9), especially one made of cast iron, including a flared adapter bell (15) having a certain depth (27), and a smooth end (7) intended to be fitted over a certain length (26) into the adapter bell (15) of an adjacent pipe, and - a cylindrical lining (11, 13) of the said inner tube (9), surrounding the said inner tube (9) over a part of its length away from its smooth end (7).   During boring, the length (26) of the smooth end (7) fitted in is less than the said depth (27), the axial thrust being transmitted from the end edge of the bell (15) to the lining (11, 13) without axial contact between the inner tubes (9) of the adjacent pipes.

Forward thrust pipeline of the type consisting of a 
succession of forward thrust pipes (1) each comprising: 


a metallic internal tube (9), in particular of cast iron, 
comprising, at one extremity, a flared fitting socket (15) 

having a certain depth (27) and, at its other extremity, a 
flat end (7) intended to be fitted over a certain length (26) 

in the fitting socket (15) of an adjacent pipe, and 
an externally cylindrical covering (11, 13) for said 
internal tube (9) surrounding said internal tube (9) over a 

portion of its length distinct from its flat end (7) and 
defining the maximum external diameter of the pipe, the length 

(26) of flat end (7) fitted at each junction between pipes 
being smaller than said depth (27) of the socket, 
 
characterised in that said covering (11, 13) comprises, on the 

one hand, an external cylindrical casing (11) centred on said 
internal tube (9) and covering the socket (15) so as to define 

an annular space which narrows in line with the socket and, on 
the other hand, at least one filling material (13) confined in 

said annular space and in that the axial thrust is 
transmitted, on the flat end side, from the extreme edge of 

the socket to at least a portion of the covering (11, 13) 
without axial contact between the internal tubes (9) of the 

adjacent pipes. 
Pipeline according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
thrust-distributing block (32), in particular of annular 

shape, is interposed between the extreme edge of the socket 
(15) and the adjacent covering (11, 13). 
Pipeline according to claim 2, characterised in that said 
thrust-distributing block has an external diameter smaller 

than the internal diameter of said external casing (11). 
Pipeline according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
filling material (13) stops a short distance back from one end 

of the external casing (11) so the casing forms an extension 
(37) covering the block (32).  

 
Pipeline according to claim 2, in which, at the 
extremities of each pipe (1), the casing (11) ends in the 

extreme plane of the socket (15) and in that of the filling 
material (13), characterised in that said thrust-distributing 

block has an external diameter at most equal to that of said 
casing. 
Pipeline according to claim 2, characterised in that each 
pipe (1) comprises at least one region of a certain length 

distinct from its socket (15) where the external casing (11) 
is interrupted revealing the filling material (13), the 

filling material (13) having an external diameter equal to the 
external diameter of said external casing (11) in the region 

not covered by said external casing (11). 
Pipeline according to any one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that the maximum external diameter of the 

internal tube (9) is comprised between the internal and 
external diameters of the external casing (11). 
Pipeline according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the extreme edge of the socket (15) of 

each pipe (1) is extended by an external rim (39). 
Forward thrust pipe for a forward thrust pipeline 
according to any one of the preceding claims.
