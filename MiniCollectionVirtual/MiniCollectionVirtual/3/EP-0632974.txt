<ABSTRACT>
A slide fastener of synthetic resin which has regularly 
spaced elements formed and fixed to the edge of fastener tape by 

the injection molding of the molten mass of the synthetic resin 
is disclosed. The fastener tape is formed of polyethylene 

terephthalate and the elements of slide fastener are made of a 
polymer alloy of polybutylene terephthalate with polypropylene 

or polyethylene terephthalate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to slide fasteners made of synthetic 
resin having regularly spaced elements formed and fixed to the 
edges of fastener tapes by the injection molding of a molten 
mass of the synthetic resin, such as that known from EP-A-0 330 171. Heretofore, in the field of slide fasteners of synthetic 
resin, the practice of manufacturing slide fasteners pigmented 
in various colors for the sake of meeting customer's diversified 
needs has been in vogue. Generally the injection molding process is utilized for the 
purpose of promoting the diversification of slide fasteners in 
color. To be specific, slide fastener chains are manufactured 
by first dyeing a fabric fastener tape in a desired color, 
introducing the dyed fastener tape into an injection molding 
machine, melting resin chips pigmented in a color coordinated 
with the color of the dyed fastener tape, and injecting the 
molten resin thereby forming and fixing the elements to the edge 
of the strip of the fastener tape. Thus, the impartation of one 
same color to the fastener tape and the elements is effected. The conventional method described above may deserve to be 
rated as a means fit for mass production. It is, however, unfit 
for the recent trend of manufacturing slide fasteners in small  
 
lots with diversification in color. This is because each time 
the color of the fastener tape is changed, the resin chips to be 
supplied to the injection molding machine must be reformulated 
to acquire a color conforming to the new color of the fastener 
tape and the work of changing the color turns out to be a highly 
complicated and time-consuming operation. Though an idea of equipping the slide fastener plant with 
as many injection molding machines as the colors of fastener tape 
to be preselected for use in the plant is conceivable, this 
equipment entails huge expense and proves unfit for production 
of slide fasteners in small lots. A primary object of the present invention is to find out 
materials for a fastener tape and elements of slide fastener 
which can be dyed equally in any desired color harmoniously 
and with a fine state of balance so as to fulfill the need to 
realize the production of slide fasteners in small lots with 
diversification in color as described above. Another object of the present invention is to find out 
materials for a fastener tape and the elements of slide fastener 
which exhibit good dyeing properties or dye affinity, manifest 
ample permeability to dye, exhibit high color fastness so as to 
defy
