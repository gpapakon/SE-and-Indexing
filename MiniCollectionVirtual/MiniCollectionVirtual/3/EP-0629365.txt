<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a jewel representing 
the phases of heavenly bodies. As is known, there are at present available 
on the market several jewels such as rings, bracelets, 
necklaces and the like, which are made with very different 
shapes and configurations. It is also possible to make jewels in which, 
by means of brilliants, enamels and the like, there 
are represented stars, the moon and other heavenly 
bodies. All these prior solutions, however, are of a 
"static" type, that is the user can not change the 
positions of the stars and/or of the comets with respect 
to the moon or modify the moon position depending 
on the several lunar cycles. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to provide such a jewel which represents the phases 
of heavenly bodies, while providing an user with the 
possibility of easily changing the jewel configuration, 
by replacing only some portions of the jewel 
itself. Within the scope of the above mentioned aim,  
 
a main object of the present invention is to provide 
such a jewel in which functional features and aesthetic 
features are so combined as to provide the jewel 
with very good commercial properties, particularly 
for people believing in the influence of the lunar 
cycles or in the phases of other heavenly bodies. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a jewel which, while having functional 
and aesthetic features improved with respect to 
those of prior like jewels, can be easily made. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as well 
as yet other objects, which will become more apparent 
hereinafter, are achieved by a jewel representing 
the phases of heavenly bodies, comprising a jewel 
body having an ornamental portion, characterized in 
that said jewel further comprises decorative portions 
representing the phases of said heavenly bodies and 
which can be removably associated with said ornamental 
portion of said jewel body. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
invention will become more apparent hereinafter from 
the following detailed disclosure of some preferred,  
 
though not exclusive, embodiment thereof, which 
are illustrated, by way of an indicative, but not 
limitative example, in the accompanying drawings, 
where: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a jewel, 
more specifically a ring, including a decorative 
portion representing a lunar phase or cycle; Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of 
the jewel shown in Figure 1; Figures 3 and 4 show
