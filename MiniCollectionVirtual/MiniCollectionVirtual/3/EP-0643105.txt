<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide based resin 
composition, especially a heat resistant polyimide based 
composition, and more particularly relates to a polyimide 
based resin composition comprising polyaryl ether ketone and 
polyetherimide in addition to the polyimide. Many kinds of polyimides which have been conventionally developed 
exhibit excellent properties such as heat resistance, static mechanical 
properties and chemical resistance. However, conventional polyimides 
have been insufficient in permanence properties such as fatigue 
resistance and creep properties. For example, a polyetherimide having 
recurring structural units of the formula(A): 
has a relatively high glass transition temperature of 210 ∼ 220 °C and 
good static mechanical strength and has been developed its uses in 
various fields. The polyimide, however, is deficient in durability such as 
resistance to fatigue and creep, and thus it has been difficult to 
develop uses for parts which require durability, that is, components 
which are exposed to repeated high stress.  In order to solve these problems, polyimide having recurring 
structural units represented by the formula(B): 
has already been developed (Japanese Laid Open Patent SHO 62-236858 and 
62-253655). The polyimide has a glass transition temperature which is 30∼40 
°C higher than that of the polyetherimide of the formula (A) and is 
excellent in mechanical properties. In point of permanence properties 
such as fatigue resistance and creep properties, the polyimide has been 
considerably improved as compared with the polyetherimide having 
recurring structural units of the formula(A). However, the improvement 
has been still unsatisfactory. For the demand of the polyimide having excellent durability, 
polyimides having various outstanding properties, for example, a trial 
of alloying the polyimide having recurring structural units of the above 
formula(B) with polyarylether ketone having good durability has been 
proposed. However, a sufficiently improved polymer alloy has not yet 
been provided. Embodiments of the polyimide based resin composition of 
the present invention desirably have good resistance to 
fatigue and creep. The present inventors have found that a polyimide based 
resin composition having good resistance to fatigue and creep may be 
obtained by mixing polyimide having recurring structural units of the  
 
below described formula(1) and polyarylether ketone with polyetherimide 
in a specific range of composition, and alloying the resultant
