<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a photographic product 
containing at least one light-sensitive layer consisting of 

a blend of silver halide emulsions. 
The blend of the invention is formed by at least one pure 
bromide emulsion, the proportion of fast emulsion grains in 

the blend is less than 50% compared with the total number 
of silver halide grains, and the proportion of slow 

emulsion grains in the blend is greater than 20%. 
The present invention makes it possible to obtain a 
radiation-sensitive photographic product which has improved 

sensitivity and granularity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a photographic product
comprising at least one light-sensitive layer consisting of
a blend of silver halide emulsions.Photographic emulsions are sensitive to light because of
the presence of silver halide grains with different sizes,
structures or compositions. The size of the silver halide
grains is directly related to the sensitivity of the
photographic emulsion obtained. In fact, the larger the
silver halide grains making up the photographic emulsions,
the more sensitive are the latter.However, emulsions with large grains have a higher
granularity than fine-grain emulsions. There is therefore
a predictable relationship between photographic sensitivity
and granularity. It has been possible to determine
empirically that whenever the sensitivity of an emulsion is
increased twofold, an increase in granularity of 7 to 10
units is obtained.Polydisperse emulsions which have a normal grain size
distribution curve offer a good compromise, which enables
sensitive emulsions to be obtained whilst retaining low
granularity. Such emulsions can be obtained directly by
precipitating silver halide grains, or by mixing
monodisperse emulsions of different mean sizes. This
technique of mixing monodisperse emulsions enables
emulsions to be obtained with a particularly reproducible
polydispersity.Photographic products comprising at least one blend of
photographic emulsions with different sensitivities are
described in the prior art. For example, US patent 
4,689,292 describes such a light-sensitive photographic
product having high sensitivity and good covering power.The products described in the aforesaid patent comprise at
least one silver halide emulsion where the size
distribution curve for the grains making up the emulsion
has at least two peaks separated by 0.1 to 0.3 µm, that is
to say the photographic emulsion consists of at least two
populations of silver halide grains having mean grain sizes
which differ by at least 0.1 µm and no more than 0.3 µm.
These emulsions are spectrally sensitised by particular
spectral dyes affording sensitisation of the orthochromatic
type. This emulsion may be obtained from polydisperse
and/or monodisperse emulsions. This emulsion may be
utilised in a single layer or in different superimposed
layers. In the examples illustrating US patent 4 689 292,
the emulsions used are obtained from blends of polydisperse
and/or monodisperse emulsions with a core and a shell,
referred to as "core-shell emulsions", containing at least
20% iodide in the core. The
