<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus which can resend an error 

page et seq. when a communication error occurs, wherein 
a sender notifies a receiver in a pre-procedure that 

the sender can resend an error page et seq. The 
receiver does not record data of an error page, or 

refuses reception except for error-resending from the 
sender disconnected due to the error for a 

predetermined period of time. The apparatus has a 
controller for notifying the receiver that resending of 

an error page et seq. is performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile
apparatus and, more particularly, to a facsimile
apparatus capable of resending an error page et seq.The present invention also relates to a facsimile
apparatus which can resend an error page et seq. and
separate and output data for each communication.In a conventional facsimile apparatus capable of
resending an error page et seq., the receiver is not
notified that the sender can resend the error page et
seq., and resending is not notified by a protocol
signal when resending of the error page et seq. is
actually performed.It has been conventionally proposed to send image
signals with data indicating resending communication
when resending of an error page et seq. is performed.
However, this data is not included in a protocol
signal, so that the receiver cannot recognize whether
it is a normal reception operation or error-resending.The receiver cannot recognize whether
error-resending is performed. For this reason, another
communication (reception) is inserted between the error
communication (reception) and the communication 
(reception) of error-resending. In this case, the user
cannot recognize at a look that the two communications
(receptions) are the same communication (reception),
and correct distribution is impossible.For a facsimile apparatus which separates and
outputs data for each communication, a method has been
proposed in which the bin of a sorter is changed for
each communication, data of one communication is bound
by a stapler, or a cutting operation is performed for
each communication when roll paper is used. In such an
apparatus, an error communication is handled as one
communication.If the sender has a function of resending an error
page et seq. upon the error communication, the error
communication and the error-resending are handled as
two communications. When data is separated for each
communication by a sorter, these communications are
thus output to two bins of the sorter. When data for
each communication is bound by a stapler or the like
for separation, the binding operation is performed for
each communication (two communications). When data is
recorded on roll paper and separated by cutting the
paper for each communication, the cutting operation is
performed for each communication (two communications).As described above, even if the receiver has a
function of separating data for each communication, one
communication is divided into two or more 
communications when error-resending is performed.
Therefore, the user cannot exactly

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus capable of separating data for
each received communication, comprising:


receiving means (102, 106) for receiving first data
sent at a first time by a first communication and second

data sent at a second time later than the first time by a
second communication,

   
characterised by
 further comprising:

managing means (146, 148, 152) for identifying the
first and second communications for determining a

relationship as to whether the first communication is an
error communication and the second communication is an

error-resending communication based on the first and second
communication information, and outputting an instruction to

handle the first and second communications as one
communication if the relationship is determined; and
sorting means (138, 140, 142) for outputting the first
data and the second data to the same sorter based on the

instruction output by said managing means.
An apparatus according to claim 1, comprising means for
binding data for each communication, wherein the first data

and the second data are bound as one communication based on
the instruction output by said managing means.
An apparatus according to claim 1, comprising means for
cutting recorded paper for each communication when data is

recorded on roll paper, wherein the recorded paper is not 
cut therebetween based on the instruction output by said

managing means.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein said receiving means are arranged to notify a

sender if said receiving means have a function of
separating data for each communication, including a

function of integrating error communication and error-resending
communication, the sender having means for

notifying if an error-resending communication is performed,
wherein, when the sender is notified that the receiver has

a function of separating data for each communication,
including a function of integrating error communication and

error-resending communication, and a communication error
occurs, data is resent without data indicating error-resending.
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein, when the
sender is notified that the receiver does not have a

function of separating data for each communication,
including a function of integrating error communication and

error-resending communication, data is resent with data
indicating error-resending.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein said receiving means are arranged to record only

correctly received one-page data, but is not arranged to
record incompletely received one-page data.
An apparatus according to claim 1, 4 or 5, wherein, when
said receiving means record received data in real time,

data of an error page is shifted to another place not to be
output to the same bin of the sorter.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1, 2, 4 and
5, wherein, when said receiving means record received data

in real time, data of an error communication is shifted to 
another place to be excluded from bound data for each

communication.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

wherein error communication and error-resending
communication are separately output to a communication

result report or the like, and data indicating error-resending
is output for the error-resending communication.
