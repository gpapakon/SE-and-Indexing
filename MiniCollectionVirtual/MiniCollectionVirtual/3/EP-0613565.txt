<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a selectable bright field illumination device for microscopes which provides a simple automatic illumination system for two object lenses of different apertures in both switching positions without any change in the position and aperture of the diaphragms. To this end, in a prior art illumination device consisting of a light source (1), collector (2), radiant field stop (3), aperture diaphragm (4) and basic condenser (7) with a removable condenser head (8) or, alternatively to the condenser head (8), a condenser lens member (11) insertable between the aperture diaphragm (4) and the basic condenser (7), the aperture diaphragm (4) is arranged between the collector (2) and the radiant field stop (3) and imaged via an intermediate image in a plane (12) conjugated to the aperture diaphragm (4) by means of at least two auxiliary lenses (5; 6). The basic condenser (7) is supplemented in one switching position by the condenser head (8) and in the other by a condenser head (10) and the condenser lens member (11) in such a way that the two thus switchable condenser enlargements are in proportion to the switchable object lens enlargements.

Illumination equipment for microscopes with 

a stationary lamp part (1, 2, 3) with condenser (2) and light field 
stop (3), 
a stationary basic condenser (7), 
a condenser head (8) capable of being switched in, 
an aperture stop (4) and 
a switchable condenser lens member (11), which is arranged between 
the lamp part (1, 2, 3) and the basic condenser (7) and which on 

switching over of the condenser at the same time also retains the 
image position of the light field stop (3) as well as also of the 

light source (1), 
 
characterised thereby, 


that the aperture stop (4) is arranged between the condenser (2) and 
the light field stop (3), 
that at least two auxiliary lenses (5, 6), of which the first in 
cooperation with 
 
   the condenser (2) images the light source into the aperture stop 

plane and which both image the light source into a plane (12), which 
is conjugate with the aperture stop (4), in the condenser and 

additionally image the condenser (2) into the light field stop 
plane, are arranged between the condenser (2) and the basic 

condenser (7), 

that the condenser lens member (11) is switched into between the light 
field stop (3) and the plane (12), which is conjugate with the aperture 

stop (4), and 
that a second condenser head (10) is provided, which is switchable 
simultaneously with 
 
   the condenser lens member (11) and alternatively to the first 

condenser head (8), wherein the total magnifications of the 
condensers (7, 8; 7, 10, 11) in both the switch settings stand in a 

fixed ratio according to the gradation of switchable objective 
enlargements.  

 
Illumination equipment for microscopes according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that a common gear is provided for the changing 

of the condenser (7, 8) and the simultaneous switching-in of the second 
condenser head (10) as well as of the condenser lens member (11). 
Illumination equipment for microscopes according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that the switched-in condenser lens member (11) 

and/or the respectively switched-in condenser head are included in the 
correction of the respectively effective condenser. 
Illumination equipment for microscopes according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that a logic circuit is provided for the 

association of the required condenser setting with a status report of 
an equipment, which is present at the microscope, for the recognition 

of the actually pivoted-in objective and that a motorised gear device, 
which is activatable by the logic circuit, is provided for the 

production of the actually required condenser setting.
