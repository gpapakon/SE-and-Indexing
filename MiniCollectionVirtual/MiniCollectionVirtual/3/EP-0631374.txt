<ABSTRACT>
An induction motor control apparatus, for 
converting an AC power supply voltage to a motor supply 

voltage for an induction motor, includes a feedback 
control loop for controlling the level of the motor 

supply voltage such that the induction motor operates 
close to a predetermined value of power factor, and also 

includes circuits for deriving a signal which varies in 
accordance with the motor admittance (or impedance), and 

for differentiating that signal to obtain a parameter 
variation signal which indicates an amount and direction 

of any sudden change in the motor load torque. The 
parameter variation signal is applied to the control 

loop such as to immediately increase or decrease the 
motor supply voltage, as required, when any sudden 

change in load occurs, thereby ensuring rapid control 
response together with stability of control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply 
control apparatus (referred to in the following simply 
as a control apparatus) for controlling the supply 
voltage of an induction motor, and in particular to an 
induction motor control apparatus which provides a high 
efficiency of operation. In the prior art, there have been proposals for a 
type of induction motor control apparatus whereby the 
power factor at which an induction motor operates is 
detected, and a feedback control loop is utilized to 
control the level of supply voltage of the induction 
motor such as to maintain the operating power factor 
close to a target value, i.e. a value which will ensure 
a high degree of operating efficiency. Such a type of 
apparatus can be effective if the variations in load 
torque applied to the induction motor occur in a 
relatively gradual manner. However in the case of an 
induction motor which is subjected to abrupt changes in 
load torque, and in particular with abrupt changes from  
 
a light load to a high load condition occurring, it is 
found that control by such a prior art type of apparatus 
is ineffective, so that the induction motor cannot 
follow the changes in applied load. In some cases, if a 
sudden increase in load torque occurs, and the control 
apparatus cannot increase the supply voltage of the 
motor sufficienly rapidly to counteract the increased 
load, then the motor may stall. If it is attempted to modify such a prior art type 
of induction motor control apparatus such that the motor 
supply voltage will change more rapidly, i.e. such that 
the supply voltage can closely follow a sudden increase 
in motor load, it is found that the control apparatus 
becomes unstable, and oscillation may occur. Thus, 
satisfactory control cannot be achieved. It is thus 
necessary to incorporate an integrator circuit into the 
aforementioned feedback control loop, to reduce the rate 
at which the motor supply voltage can change. Hence the 
above problem cannot be overcome, i.e. the induction 
motor cannot follow a sudden change in the applied load 
torque. If there is a sudden increase in the load 
torque which exceeds the drive capability of the motor 
(i.e. the drive capability provided by the level of 
motor supply voltage that is currently being applied) 
then a rapid increase in the degree of motor slip will  
 
occur. As a result, there will be a sudden drop in the 
value of motor power factor that is detected by the 
control apparatus. When that occurs, then in spite of 
the fact there is a
