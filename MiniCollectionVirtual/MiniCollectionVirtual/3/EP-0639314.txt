<ABSTRACT>
A modular telecommunications system configured for wireless telecommunication in accordance with a pre-selected standard. Modular units (131) are adapted to be secured within other items of electronic equipment (200) for establishing a telecommunications link with a wireless network. The modular telecommunications unit (131) comprises a housing for mounting a radio transceiver (36) therein. The housing includes a plurality of contacts (41A and 41B) arranged along a first end (133), the contacts (41A and 41B) being adapted for engagement with contacts (204) in the electronic equipment (200) and at least one radio connector (51) disposed along the second, opposite end of the housing and connected to the radio transceiver (36) within the housing whereby the radio transceiver (36) can be coupled to an antenna (140) to enable communication therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to modular
telecommunication equipment and, more particularly, to
a card mounted radio transceiver and/or modem for use
in establishing a link to a wireless network for
electronic equipment such as personal computers.The fields of both data processing and
telecommunications have experienced marked advances in
recent years. Personal computers have become smaller
'and more efficient in their progression through
desktop, laptop, notebook, and palmtop versions. The
great advances in microprocessors, memory chips and
miniaturization techniques have also enabled more and
more computing power to be packaged in smaller and
smaller spaces.Personal computers are manufactured by many
different suppliers around the world. An entire
industry has subsequently developed in supplying memory
cards for enhancing the capacity of this wide variety
of personal computers. Recently, there has been a
movement toward standardizing the interconnection
formats for use in circuit cards for personal
computers. In particular, the PC and Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA) was formed with the
goal of promoting the interchangeability of integrated
circuit and memory cards among computer and other types
of electronic products. Toward this end, the PCMCIA
has promulgated certain physical and electrical
standards to ensure that cards will be able to be used
in different pieces of equipment. Both data storage,
i.e. memory, and peripheral expansion, i.e. I/O, card
types constructed in accordance with standards should
be able to be used in any connectors also constructed 
in accordance with the standards. Such a standard is
set forth in a variety of documents including the
PCMCIA PC Card Standard, Release 2.0, incorporated by
reference herein. The standard sets forth a 68 pin
interchange for I/O type circuit cards for use in PC' s.Advances in wireless telecommunications have also
moved rapidly in recent years. Various communication
standards have been promulgated around the world
defining specific frequencies, data rates, data
formats, and the like for both voice and data
communications by radio links between base stations and
mobile units. For example, specialized packet
switching systems for mobile data communications have
enabled portable computers to directly uplink data
access into the landline data communication network.
Similarly, conventional voice based cellular radio
systems, both analog and digital versions, can receive
data from portable computers and transmit that data
through the
