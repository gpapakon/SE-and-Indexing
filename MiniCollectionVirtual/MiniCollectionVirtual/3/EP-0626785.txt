<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image sensor
of a copying apparatus, a facsimile apparatus, a video
camera recorder, or the like and to an image sensor for
an automatic focusing of a camera. Preferably,
the invention relates to an image sensor having an
image signal process such as pattern recognition,
detection of a moving image, or the like.As a sensor to recognize an image (video image) as
an object, there is a report by Kazuo Kyuma, "Optical
neural net and intelligent sensor", the lecture papers
of the fourth image input technique symposium, pages 71
to 78, November 10, 1992.The above known technique, however, has the
following technical drawbacks.
(1) Since an optical current is read out, it can be
read out in only one direction and a pattern
recognizing precision is low.(2) Even in case of (64 x 64) pixels, it takes a
time of 200 µsec for a (outline) process.(3) Since a Schottky diode is formed by a comb-shaped Aℓ
metal film, a numerical aperture of a photosensitive
device is small and a sensitivity is low. (4) Since a current is read out, a layout pattern
of read-out wirings is complicated.(5) Noises cannot be removed and it is difficult
to perform an image process at a high precision.EP-A-0349027 proposes a radiation transducing device
intended for use in circumstances in which it is intended
to detect radiation only at one or a few locations in the
picture area, for example in recording collisions of
elementary particles in experiments at high energy
storage rings or detecting flashes of lightning. In an
array of pixel elements, each element provides an output
both in a row direction and in a column direction. The
device as a whole provides both analog and digital
outputs in both row and column directions. The analog
output is provided by connecting signals to a plurality
of source followers connected in parallel with each other
and in series with a load. When radiation is incident
on more than one row or column of pixels, the voltage
over the load is determined by the largest amount of
radiation incident on a pixel. The digital outputs
provide a signal indicating whether the amount of
radiation received exceeds a pre-set threshold value and
signals specifying the row and column number of the pixel
which received the radiation.According to the present invention there is provided 
a two-dimensional array of signal generating elements,
as set out in claim 1. Optional features are set out in
the remaining claims.An embodiment of the invention provides an image
sensor which can execute a signal
