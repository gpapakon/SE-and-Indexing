<ABSTRACT>
An emergency brake for an elevator car. The problem with car brakes is the uneven braking force applied and uneven wear of the linings. The elevator employs springs which maintain a constant braking force on the shoes. The springs (15, 16) are compressed by a fluid operable piston and cylinder assembly (35). The springs (15, 16) move a cam follower (17) along cam surfaces (20, 21) shaped to cause the cam follower (17) to move one brake shoe (22) toward the other shoe (24). Switches (63, 57) operable by the cam follower (17) control the car (4) so that movement of the car (4) is prevented when the springs (15, 16) are not compressed and when there is excessive shoe wear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an emergency brake and
particularly, to an emergency brake for an elevator car.
Such emergency brake can be activated by an unsafe
condition, such as overspeeding of the elevator car or an
elevator car leaving a floor with its door open.Elevator cars and other vehicles and devices, such as
hooks, buckets and material harnesses on cranes or launching
apparatus, are movable in two opposite directions,
frequently by means of a cable or wire rope.Generally speaking, elevator cars movable by hoist
ropes are suspended by wire ropes which go over a traction
sheave and down to a counterweight. The counterweight
serves to reduce the power required to move the elevator and
also to create traction (prevent slippage) with respect to
the traction sheave. The traction sheave is driven directly
by a motor or indirectly by a motor through a geared
machine. A normal brake is applied to the drive to stop or
hold the elevator at a floor.With elevator cars, specifically, the usual elevator
codes require that an emergency brake be included, such
brake arresting the descent of the elevator car when it is
descending at a speed in excess of a predetermined speed. A
known braking device for such purpose is the safety device
which grips the car guide rails even in the event of
breakage of the elevator hoisting rope.With a high factor of safety for the wire ropes, one
country has recognized that these ropes never break and is
allowing other emergency brakes in lieu of the safety device
which grips the guide rails. Also, since counterweights are
generally heavier than the elevator, with a mechanical
failure, such as that of the normal brake, there is danger
of the elevator overspeeding in the ascending direction. In
addition, depending on the load in the elevator car and with 
a mechanical failure, the car could leave the floor in
either direction with the doors open. One country
already requires emergency devices to be activated in the
event of the above, and several other countries are
considering code changes to require ascending car
overspeed protection, as well as protection against
leaving the floor with the doors opened. Known braking
devices include brakes applied to the hoisting drum
(traction sheave), to the hoisting ropes, or to the car
or counterweight guide rails.For example, GB-A-1 184 560 describes a safety brake
comprising a support frame for a pair of brake shoes, at
least one of the shoes being carried by a wedge slidable
in the frame between the other shoe and a wedge support
(or
