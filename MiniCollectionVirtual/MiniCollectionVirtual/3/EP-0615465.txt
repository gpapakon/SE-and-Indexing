<ABSTRACT>
Indoor game for two players comprising a flat, smooth surface (10), a round disc (16), two round strikers (15 and 15') and two goals (17 and 17'). A raised edge on the surface (2) prevents the disc from falling off. Each player aims to strike the disc with a striker, so that it falls into the opponent's goal, while preventing the disc from being sent into its own goal. The very light disc in the shape of an upside down cone with a diameter of 64 mm and a thickness of 1 mm, is not very deep, with its edge (18) forming an angle of 0.3  . When the disc is struck by a striker, the air forced against the disc's underside lifts said disc, projecting it through the air, so that it is carried along on a thin air cushion. Since the disc is projected over the game table without frictionally contacting the surface, it is able to maintain a very high speed, testing the skill and reflexes of the players as they seek to strike or block the swiftly moving disc.
