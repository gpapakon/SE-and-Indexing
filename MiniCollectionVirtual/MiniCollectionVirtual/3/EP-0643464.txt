<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power-cable heating accessory, especially an electrical-conductor joint, comprising a cylindrical rigid support intended to fit over the conductors, as well as a jacket made of EPR-based elastomeric material, this jacket being expanded around the said support and consisting of an inserted triple-layer body and of an outer envelope, padding, containing a substance capable of undergoing an exothermic reaction, being arranged around at least part of the jacket. This accessory is characterised in that a rigid shell (19) for thermal insulation and for mechanical protection is arranged on the outer face of the padding (14), this shell covering the ends of the rigid internal support (5), the padding (14) being interposed between the jacket and the shell (19).
