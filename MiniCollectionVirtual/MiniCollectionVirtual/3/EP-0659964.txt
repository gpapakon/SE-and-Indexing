<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for controlling the displacements of a cable (7) within its sheath by means of at least one lever (4, 5) making it possible to displace the cable (7) between three different positions, advanced, intermediate and retracted, corresponding to three functions to be controlled, and is characterised in that the end (70) of the cable (7) is fixed to a block (1) sliding in a groove in the vicinity of at least one lever (4, 5), the said block (1) being provided with at least two teeth (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) on a face turned towards the lever (4, 5), and making it possible either, by a double pull on the single lever (4), to displace the block (1) successively between the three positions or, by a successive pull on each of the two levers (4, 5), to displace the block (1) between the three positions.
