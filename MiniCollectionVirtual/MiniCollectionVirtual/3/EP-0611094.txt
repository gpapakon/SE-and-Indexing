<ABSTRACT>
A valve for incorporation between a fuel injection nozzle (11) and the 
pumping chamber (12) of a spill type fuel injection pump (13) includes a 

valve member (19) slidable in a cylinder (17). The ends of the cylinder 
are connected to the nozzle and pumping chamber respectively and 

formed in t he cylinder is a seating (18). The valve member is biased by 
a spring into engagement with the seating and a flow path exists between 

the end of the cylinder connected to the nozzle (11) and a position in 
the cylinder upstream of the seating considered in the direction of fuel 

flow to the nozzle. The valve also includes an orifice (24) 
interconnecting the ends of the cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve for incorporation in a fuel 
delivery line extending between the pumping chamber of a spill type 
fuel injection pump and an injection nozzle which incorporates a fuel 
pressure actuated valve member. It is known to incorporate in the delivery line of such a pump a 
conventional unloading seated delivery valve and in series therewith a so 
called snubber valve. The action of the delivery valve is to unload a 
predetermined volume of fuel from the delivery line at the termination of 
delivery of fuel from the pumping chamber, prior to closure of the valve. 
The action of the snubber valve is to damp the return flow of fuel so as 
to minimise the risk of cavitation. When the delivery valve has closed 
the fuel remaining in the delivery line is pressurised to a level which is 
below the nozzle closing pressure but is above the residual pressure in 
the pumping chamber. In spite of the presence of the snubber valve it has been found 
that cavities can form in the delivery line between the valves and the 
nozzle and in the nozzle itself and the collapse of the cavities can cause 
erosion of the pipeline which forms the delivery line and also the 
nozzle. The object of the invention is to provide a valve for the purpose 
specified in a simple and convenient form. According to the invention a valve for the purpose specified 
comprises a cylinder one end of which in use is connected to the  
 
pumping chamber and the other end to the fuel injection nozzle, a 
seating defined in the cylinder, a valve member slidable in the cylinder, 
resilient means biasing the valve member into engagement with the 
seating, an orifice through which communication is established between 
the ends of the cylinder so as to afford constant communication between 
the pumping chamber and the injection nozzle and a flow path 
interconnecting the other end of the cylinder with a position in the 
cylinder downstream of the seating considered in the direction of fuel 
flow to the nozzle. An example of a valve in accordance with the invention will 
now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing which 
shows a sectional side elevation of the valve shown connected into a 
fuel system. Referring to the drawing the valve is shown diagrammatically at 
10 and is connected in the pipeline intermediate a fuel injection nozzle 
11 and the pumping chamber 12 of a spill type fuel injection pump 13. 
The injection pump 13 includes a plunger 14 movable inwardly by the 
action of an engine driven cam, the

(13) and a fuel injection nozzle (11) characterised in that the valve (10) 
comprises a cylinder (17) one end of which in use is connected to the 

pumping chamber (12) and the other end of which is connected to the 
nozzle (11), a seating (18) defined in the cylinder, a valve member (19) 

slidable in the cylinder, resilient means (20) biasing the valve member 
into engagement with the seating, an orifice (24) through which 

communication is established between the ends of the cylinder so as to 
afford constant communication between the pumping chamber and the 

injection nozzle and a flow path interconnecting the other end of the 
cylinder with a position in the cylinder downstream of the seating (18) 

considered in the direction of fuel flow to the nozzle.
