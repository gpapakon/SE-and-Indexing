<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tubular prostheses which
are placed within the body.Tubular prostheses are used in body lumens to
perform various functions. For example, a tubular stent
may be used to maintain the opening of an esophagus that
has been restricted by a tumor or a blood vessel
restricted by plaque. Tubular grafts are used to
substitute for or reinforce a weakened lumen, such as the
aorta or other blood vessel that has been weakened by an
aneurysm. In this latter technique, a graft of a knitted
dacron may be used to advantage since the textured nature
of the textile can induce blood clotting along the graft
to contribute to the patency of the lumen formed by the
graft.Tubular prostheses for purposes such as the above
may be positioned in the body lumen during a surgical
procedure or may be delivered into the body by a catheter
that supports the prosthesis in a compact form during
percutaneous insertion and transport through body
passageways to a desired site. Upon reaching the site,
the prosthesis is expanded so that it engages the walls
of the lumen. After this operation, the catheter is
removed, leaving the device in the body.The expansion technique may involve forcing the
prosthesis to expand radially outwardly, for example, by
inflation of a balloon carried by the catheter. Knitted,
balloon expandable stents are discussed for example in
Strecker U.S. 4,922,905.
In another technique,
the prosthesis is formed of an elastic material that can
be arranged and held in a compact form for insertion and 
allowed to expand when in position by its own internal
elastic restoring force. Knitted self-expanding stents
are described in Strecker WO 92/09245 and in Anderson
US-A-5234457, filed October 9, 1991.US patent no. 4,922,905 describes an endoprosthesis made from a plastically deformable
metal wire. GB 1,173,811 describes a tubular prosthetic device to be used for replacing
an excised segment of pathology by suture anastomosis, said device being made i.a. from
a composite yarn comprising a synthetic strand and a resorbable strand.The invention provides prostheses with improved
properties by forming the prostheses of multiple
filaments or strands of different materials, one of which
is a structural filament, preferably metal. In preferred
embodiments, the strands are knit into a tubular form.
In some embodiments, multiple strands of different
materials are co-knit into a stent. The term "co-knit"
as used herein refers to the knitting of multiple
discrete strands in the knit pattern. In certain
