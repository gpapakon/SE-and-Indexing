<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aromatase-inhibiting 
composition containing an azole derivative. Estrogen, a sex hormone, is synthesized from 
androgenic steroids in the tissues such as ovary or 
placenta. In the biosynthetic pathway for the estrogen 
formation from an androgenic steroid, aromatization is 
essential, and aromatase takes part in such aromatization. 
It is therefore expected that if the aromatase can be 
effectively inhibited, estrogen-dependent diseases can be 
effectively treated (Cancer Research, Vol. 42, Suppl. 8, 
3261s, 1982), and to this end certain aromatase inhibitors 
have been proposed. 4-Hydroxyandrostenedione is known as such an aromatase 
inhibitor. However, many of the steroid type drugs are 
generally attended with considerable side effects in 
practical use. It is demanded to provide an aromatase inhibitor 
possessing an excellent inhibitory activity on the 
aromatase. As a result of the present inventors' earnest studies, 
it has been found that azole derivatives having a non-steroidal 
chemical structure quite different from 
4-hydroxyandrostenedione have an inhibitory activity on the  
 
aromatase. The present invention has been attained on the 
basis of this finding. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
aromatase inhibiting composition containing an azole 
derivative which is low in toxicity (side effects) and 
shows a remarkable inhibitory activity on the aromatase. To achieved the aim, in an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition 
comprising an aromatase-inhibiting effective amount of a 
compound selected from the group consisting of compounds of 
the formula (I): 
including their stereoisomers and salts thereof, 
wherein R¹ is halogen or phenyl; m is 0, 1, 2 or 3; k and n 
each are independently 0, 1 or 2; R² and R³ each are 
independently H or OH; R⁶ and R⁷ each are independently H 
or C₁₋₄ alkyl; R⁸ and R⁹ each are H or R⁸ and R⁹ form 
-C(R⁴)(R⁵)-C(R¹¹)(R¹²)- bond wherein R⁴, R⁵, R¹¹ and R¹² 
each are independently H or C₁₋₄ alkyl; Y is N or CH; and 
R¹⁰ is H or halogen, or R¹⁰ combines with R² to form -O-bond, 
with proviso that if R⁸ and R⁹ form -C (R⁴) (R⁵)-C(R¹¹)(R¹²)- 
bond, R³, R⁶ and R⁷ each are H, and k and n 
each are 1, then R² and R¹⁰ form -O- bond, and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.  The azole derivative according to the present 
invention is preferably an isolated single stereoisomer. 
The "stereoisomers" referred to herein include geometrical 
isomers, optical isomers
