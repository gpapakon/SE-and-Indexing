<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a rigid panel for a vehicle roof, with a peripheral seal opposite the roof opening and with a glass panel, which is bonded to a laterally protruding frame, on which is mounted a peripheral, approximately T-shaped aluminium frame, a gap seal running between the latter and the roof opening. For the purpose of more simple manufacture and easier assembly using fewer separate parts, according to the invention it is envisaged that the gap seal (3) be manufactured in the form of a coextruded profile with an inner, vertically extending profile region (12) made of an elastomer and an outer hollow-chamber profile (13) made of microcellular rubber, and be connected as a peripheral strand to the outside (19) of the vertical limb of the T-shaped aluminium frame (15), and that the component finished in this manner be placed onto the protruding edge region of the other component, which comprises the glass panel (1) and base frame (10), and be screwed thereto.
