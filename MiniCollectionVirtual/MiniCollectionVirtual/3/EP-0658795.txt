<ABSTRACT>
An all-optical flip-flop device is achieved by employing two optical 
amplifiers (150,160) arranged so that they together operate in only one 

of two 
stable states at a given time. In a first stable state of operation, the first 

optical amplifier (150) behaves as a laser having a first predetermined 
characteristic wavelength. The arrangement is switched to a second 

stable state of operation in which the second optical amplifier (160) 
behaves as 

a laser having a second characteristic wavelength, where the first and 
second characteristic wavelengths are at least nominally different, when 

an optical signal pulse is received at the input (SET) of the first 
optical 

amplifier. The arrangement is switched back to the first stable state 
when an optical signal pulse is received at the input (RESET) 

of the second optical amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optics and, more particularly to
an all-optical flip-flop device.All-optical signal processing and telecommunication devices are
presently being developed to exploit the high speed, immunity to
electromagnetic interference, very large bandwidth and capacity, and
low loss, distortion and crosstalk characteristics of guided-wave
lightwave technology, particularly in forms using optical fiber. "All
optical" means the devices not only have optical inputs and outputs, but
all intermediate signal processing is accomplished optically rather than
electrically. All-optical devices are more desirable than opto-electrical
devices which convert an optical signal into an electrical analog because
a signal remaining in the single optical domain can make best use of the
inherent advantages of lightwave technology. In addition, all-optical
systems generally require less components and are less complex than
their opto-electric counterparts performing similar functions.One of the first areas to develop in all-optical signal processing
was optical amplification with the advent of semiconductor optical
amplifiers and rare-earth-doped amplifying optical fibers such as
erbium-doped optical fibers. Rare-earth-doped amplifying optical fibers
exhibit low noise, relatively large, polarization-independent bandwidth,
reduced cross-talk, low insertion loss, and are relatively inexpensive to
fabricate. Thus, all-optical amplifiers offer substantial performance
advantages over competing opto-electrical amplifier technology.Clearly, there is a need for more all-optical devices, beyond optical
amplification, to further exploit the inherent advantages of lightwave
technology in digital applications. For example, while electrical flip-flop
devices have existed for many years, an all-optical flip-flop device has
not yet been realized. An all-optical flip-flop would facilitate the 
implementation of all-optical sequential logic and bit-storage devices.
Present optical bit-storage devices using electrical intermediate signal
processing and fiber delay lines, while operating satisfactorily in certain
applications, are not suitable for other applications due to the inherent
limitations possessed by all opto-electrical devices. The feature of the preamble of claim 1 are in combination known from GB 2 118 765 A.An all-optical flip-flop device is achieved in an apparatus according to claim 1 by employing two optical
amplifiers arranged so that they together operate in only one of two
stable states at a given
