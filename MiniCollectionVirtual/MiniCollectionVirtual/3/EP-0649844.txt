<ABSTRACT>
Contaminants are removed from impure propylene oxide 
by fractionating in a first column to remove overhead 

essentially all of the pentenes and pentanes and most of 
the oxygen-containing impurities, extractively 

distilling the first bottoms fraction in a second extractive 
column using a C₂ to C₆ alkylene glycol extractive 

distillation agent to form a second overhead fraction 
comprising propylene oxide, hexenes, hexanes, water, 

residual quantities of pentenes and pentanes and oxygen-containing 
impurities, extractively distilling the second 

overhead fraction in a third column using a C₆ to C₁₀ alkane 
hydrocarbon extractive distillation agent to form a third 

bottoms fraction comprising the extractive distillation 
agent, propylene oxide, hexenes, hexanes, residual 

quantities of pentenes and pentanes and water, and 
extractively distilling said third bottoms fraction in a 

fourth column using a C₆ to C₁₀ alkane hydrocarbon 
extractive distillation agent to form a fourth overhead 

fraction consisting essentially of propylene oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the purification of 
propylene oxide. More particularly, this invention 
relates to a plural stage distillation process for 
removing contaminating quantities of impurities from 
propylene oxide. Still more particularly, this invention 
relates to a plural stage distillation process for the 
purification of impure propylene oxide contaminated with 
impurities including water, propylene, propane, 
acetaldehyde, methyl formate, propionaldehyde, hexenes, 
acetone, hexanes, methanol, t-butyl alcohol, pentanes, 
pentenes, isopropyl alcohol and t-butyl formate. It is known to use alkane hydrocarbons containing 6 
to 18 carbon atoms as extractive distillation agents in 
the purification of propylene oxide. See, for example, 
US-A-3338800, US-A-3464897, US-A-3607669 and US-A-3843488. 
US-A-3464897 shows that an alkane such as octane is 
effective for the removal of 6 carbon atom alkane 
impurities such as 2-methyl pentane, 4-methyl pentene-1, 
2-methyl pentene-1 and 2-methyl pentene-2. US-A-3843488 
shows that alkanes containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, 
and preferably from 8 to 10 carbon atoms, such as n-octane, 
is effective for removing hydrocarbon impurities 
containing 5 to 7 carbons from propylene oxide. It is also known to use alkylene glycols containing 
from 2 to 6 carbon atoms as extractive distillation agents 
in the purification of propylene oxide. US-A-3578568 
discloses the use of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol  
 
as extractive agents for the purification of propylene 
oxide. US-A-5139622 discloses the use of triethylene 
glycol as an extractive distillation agent and 
US-A-5160587 discloses the use of dipropylene glycol as an 
extractive distillation agent. The use of plural stage distillation for the 
purification of propylene oxide has also been proposed. 
US-A-3881996 discloses a plural stage process for the 
purification of propylene oxide including a first 
fractionation wherein light impurities such as 
acetaldehyde are removed overhead followed by a second 
distillation step wherein heavy impurities such as 
propionaldehyde are removed in order to provide a second 
distillate fraction which is then extractively distilled 
in the presence of octane in a third distillation zone to 
provide pure propylene oxide and to remove alkane 
hydrocarbon impurities such as C6 carbon atom impurities 
from the propylene oxide. Schmidt et al. teach that it is 
important to use the proper sequence of distillation steps 
and that, for example, removal of heavy impurities
