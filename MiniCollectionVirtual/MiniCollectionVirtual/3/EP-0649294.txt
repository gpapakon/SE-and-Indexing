<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved intraocular lens haptic (14) having an enlarged anchoring head (16) and an integrally formed support portion (20) extending therefrom. An oblong hole (18) is provided in the anchoring head. The haptic is punched from a sheet or ribbon of polyvinylidene fluoride film, and thereafter a lens optic (12) is cast around the anchoring head. During the casting operation, the lens optic material fills in the oblong hole (18) and all spaces around the anchoring head (16). Thus, the anchoring head (16) is firmly embedded in an outer periphery of the lens optic (12). Because the haptic is punched, it can be fabricated to have a variety of different anchoring head shapes and to have a variety of support portion shapes with varying numbers of bends at different bend angles. The orientation of the oblong hole (18) within the anchoring head (16) is also easily changed as is the orientation of the anchoring head (16) relative to the support portion (20), although both structures are integral and formed from a single sheet of material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED INTRAOCULAR LENS HAPTICFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to support structures for intraocular lenses. More specifically, the present invention relates to ar intraocular lens haptic having an oblong hole disposed in a unique enlarged anchoring head, wherein the haptic exhibits improved pull strength and stability.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAn intraocular lens has a principal refractive structure, known as a lens optic, and one or more support structures for positioning and centering the lens optic within the anterior or posterior chamber of an eye. Commonly referred to as "haptics", these support structures may be integrally formed with the lens optic (a one-piece lens) , or separately manufactured and attached to the lens optic (a multi-piece lens) .An important goal for intraocular lens design is to minimize trauma to the eye when the lens is inserted. To that end, effort is made to ensure, for example, that the incision to the eye is kept small during the implantation operation; that biologically inert materials are used in the construction of the intraocular lens; and that the physical proportions of the lens do not interfere, irritate, or damage delicate inner eye tissue. What makes achieving the design goals difficult is that often the characteristics necessary for a good lens optic are undesireable for the lens haptic, and vice versa. The two have conflicting design requirements.Conventional intraocular lens optics, for instance, are commonly made from biocompatible materials such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) . With this rather rigid material, lens optics are easily cast or machined into their final form. So in regard to handling ease and manufacturability, the benefits of PMMA are obvious. By 

the same token, because this material is rigid, many of the foregoing design goals are compromised.More recently, however, more flexible materials have been devised for the lens optic. Flexible lens optics cast of elastomeric materials such as silicone or hydrogels, for example, have gained popularity because they produce foldable intraocular lenses that may be inserted through a beneficially small incision in the eye. Once the intraocular lens is implanted, the haptics must hold the lens optic in proper alignment with the optical axis of the eye as well as support the weight of the lens optic. The haptics must therefore be sufficiently rigid to perform their function. In short, haptics must simultaneously be pliant enough to avoid damaging delicate eye tissue yet rigid
