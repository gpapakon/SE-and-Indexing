<ABSTRACT>
A device for bending the ends (17) which result from cutting to size a 
metallic binding spiral (9) includes a contrasting member (4) provided at 

the front with two pairs (12, 12') of flat lugs, mutually parallel and 
orthogonal to the axis of the spiral (9), suitable to securely retain the roots 

(16) of the two prongs (14) of the spiral (9) between which the cut has 
been performed, and a pushing member (7) provided at the front with a 

central tooth (13) radiused to the body of the pusher (7) and also 
orthogonal to the axis of the spiral (9), suitable to bend the ends (17) 

parallelly to the prongs (14) by interacting with said contrast (4). The 
contrast (4) and the pusher (7) move along substantially orthogonal axes 

under the action of double-acting pneumatic jacks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns devices for the production of metallic 
binding elements, and particularly a device suitable to bend the end of the 
element after it has been cut to size to carry out the binding operation. It is known (see for example US-A 3334918) 
that said metallic binding elements are produced from a 
plastic-coated metallic wire which is bent in successive steps until it forms 
a series of curved prongs on which the sheets to be bound are inserted 
prior to closing said prongs to a ring shape by bringing their tips next to 
the respective roots. These binding elements are commonly called 
"spirals" though they do not have an exactly spiraliform shape, and this 
word will be used in the following for sake of simplicity. The final binding operation takes place only after the spiral length 
has been cut to the size of the sheet height from the continuous spiral 
wound on a reel. This cut is performed on a length of wire, parallel to the 
spiral axis, which acts as a connection between two subsequent prongs, 
thus defining the spiral pitch. Therefore, it results that the spiral ends with 
a length of wire parallel to the axis thereof and having a metallic point 
which has been uncoated and jagged by the cutting tool. It is apparent that this is a danger to those who handle the group of 
sheets thus bound, since said point may get into their hands or even 
worse it may hurt the face or the oral cavity of a child putting it into his 
mouth. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a device 
suitable to prevent said possibilities by bringing the spiral end parallel to 
the prongs, so that it does not project axially. This object is achieved by means of a device having the 
characteristics cited in claim 1. The apparent advantage of the device according to the present 
invention is that the metallic point is bent so that it does not project and 
therefore is no more a danger to those who handle the bound sheets. The characteristics of the device according to the present invention 
will be apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred  
 
embodiment thereof, reported as a non-limiting example, referring to the 
annexed drawings wherein: 
Fig.1a is a front view of the device according to the present 
invention; Figs.1b and 1c are partial enlargements of the device of fig.1a seen 
along the direction of arrow B and C, respectively; and Figs.2, 3, 4 and 5 schematically illustrate the device operation. Referring to fig.1a, there is seen that the device
