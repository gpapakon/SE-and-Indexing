<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a process for recovering 
caffeine from activated carbon loaded with caffeine, said 

process comprising contacting said activated carbon having 
caffeine adsorbed thereon with methyl-ethylketone, 

ethylacetate, dichloromethane, or a mixture of methyl-ethylketone 
and ethylacetate for a period of time sufficient 

to desorb at least a portion of the caffeine from the 
activated carbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for
recovering caffeine from activated carbon loaded with
caffeine, as well as to a process for decaffeinating green
coffee.The decaffeination of vegetable materials is a
commercially important process, especially with respect to the
decaffeination of green coffee, but also tea and other
vegetable materials can be decaffeinated with advantage to
obtain caffeine-free or low caffeine materials.In the art numerous processes have been described for
decaffeination of vegetable materials. A number of said
processes is based upon the direct extraction of caffeine from
the materials, for example with solvents or supercritical
carbon dioxide. However, the most important processes are
based upon the principle of extracting at least the caffeine
from the vegetable material into an aqueous liquid, from which
aqueous liquid the caffeine is recovered and the aqueous
liquid is re-used.The recovery of the caffeine from the aqueous liquid can
be done in a number of ways. The present invention is directed
with an improvement of one of the methods used therefor,
namely the method of recovering the caffeine from the aqueous
liquid using activated carbon. The present invention more in
particular deals with an improvement in the regeneration of
the activated carbon in order to carry out the regeneration in
an improved way, resulting in a process that is more
economically attractive.In the art various methods have been disclosed for carbon
caffeine separation. For example in the European patent
application 42,295 a process for recovering caffeine from
activated carbon is disclosed, said process comprising 
contacting activated carbon having caffeine adsorbed thereon
with a caffeine solvent comprising an organic acid or an
alcohol. More in particular in the examples glacial acetic
acid or mixtures thereof with other organic chemicals have
been used. In the European patent application 76620 of the
same applicant as the above-identified European patent
application dilute solutions of acetic acids have been
disclosed.In the European patent applications 248,482, 251,362 and
259,905 various organic acids and mixtures thereof have been
proposed for desorption of caffeine from activated carbon. In
the European patent applications 129,609 and 129,610 the use
of water and an aqueous formic acid solution have been
disclosed.Although a number of the above proposals have led to an
improved recovery of the caffeine from the activated carbon
there is still a need for further improvement, both

Process for recovering caffeine from activated
carbon loaded with caffeine, said process comprising

contacting said activated carbon having caffeine adsorbed
thereon with methyl-ethylketone, ethylacetate,

dichloromethane, or a mixture of methyl-ethylketone and
ethylacetate for a period of time sufficient to desorb at

least a portion of the caffeine from the activated carbon.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the said
caffeine loaded activated carbon has been obtained from

decaffeinating vegetable matter, such such as coffee and tea.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
activated carbon having caffeine adsorbed thereon also

contains water.
Process according to any one of the claims 1-3,
wherein the activated carbon is contacted with the recovery

agent at a temperature ranging from 20 to 90°C, preferably
from 40 to 85°C.
Process according to any one of the claims 1-4,
wherein the caffeine is recovered from the recovery agent in

which it is dissolved by evaporation of the solvent.
Process according to claim 1-5, wherein the caffein
is recrystalized after recovery from the solvent.
Process for decaffeinating green coffee, said
process comprising extracting caffeine from said green coffee

into an aqueous liquid, adsorbing the caffeine from said
aqueous liquid on activated carbon, and contacting said

activated carbon having caffeine adsorbed thereon with methyl-ethylketone,
ethylacetate, dichloromethane, or a mixture of

methyl-ethylketone and ethylacetate for a period of time
sufficient to desorb at least a portion of the caffeine from

the activated carbon. 
Process according to claim 7, wherein said aqueous
liquid constitutes a caffeine-free equilibrium green coffee

extract.
Process according to claim 7, wherein said aqueous

liquid constitutes water or a solution substantially free from
soluble green coffee solids, resulting in a green coffee

extract from which the caffeine is removed by contact with the
activated carbon, following which the caffeine freed green

coffee extract is returned to extracted green coffee.
Process according to claim 7-9, wherein the green
coffee is subsequently roasted.
Process according to claim 7-10, wherein the
activated carbon, after desorption of caffeine from it, is

reused in adsorbing caffeine from the said aqueous extract.
