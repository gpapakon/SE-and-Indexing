<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method, an apparatus and a container for the despatch of printed products. The method according to the invention is characterised essentially in that the printed products arrive, in reusable containers matched to their format, at their respective despatch points. These reusable containers can then be reused after being transported back to a packaging station. The containers which can be used for this purpose are characterised essentially in that they have free spaces, extending from the container bottom to the upper container edge, for access to printed products to be deposited therein. The apparatus according to the invention, which is to be employed for the packaging, is characterised by a magazine for receiving reusable containers stacked one in the other, out of which magazine the containers can be extracted individually in order to be filled with printed products.

Method of dispatching printed products to a dispatch point, in which the printed
products are packaged in a packaging means and transported to the dispatch point,

packaging being effected by depositing the printed products on a receiving surface
of corresponding shape on the bottom of substantially rigid containers,

characterised in that the receiving surface on the bottom prevents substantially
lateral displacement of the deposited printed products by means of side parts of the

container extending from the lateral edges of the receiving surface and that
transportation is effected in these containers, from which the printed products are

removed at the dispatch point, alter which the containers are transported back to
the packaging means.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the containers are stacked one
inside the other for transportation back to the packaging means.
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the containers
filled with the printed products are transported stacked one on top of the other.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the printed
products are transferred in a regular formation, in particular as a shingle stream,

from the outlet of a processing means serving for their production to a
substantially vertically extending feed chute of the packaging means, by means of

which they are advanced individually or in stacks formed of a required number of
printed products to one of the containers provided therebelow.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the container is rotated at least
once about an axis extending substantially perpendicularly to its bottom between

the deposit of successive printed products.
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the container is rotated through
180Â°. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
containers are supplied to the packaging means stacked one inside the other, and

are then removed individually for filling with the printed products.
Container for dispatching printed products, comprising a substantially rigid bottom
(60; 100) and substantially rigid side parts (62 to 66; 104 to 114) extending

therefrom, the side parts (62 to 66; 104 to 114) extending from lateral edges of a
receiving surface (62; 102) corresponding in shape to the printed products on the

bottom (60; 100) to an upper container edge, characterised in that the inner
surfaces of the side parts form bearing surfaces preventing substantially lateral

displacement of printed products deposited on the receiving surface (70; 102), a
free space extending from the bottom (60; 100) to the upper container edge being

provided between at least two bearing surfaces in order to facilitate access to
printed products inserted into the container (26).
Container according to claim 8, characterised in that one of the free spaces is
provided in the region of two opposing lateral edges.
Container according to claim 8 or claim 9, characterised in that the free space is
delimited on its side remote from the printed products to be deposited by further

side parts (64, 68; 118 to 136) extending from regions of the bottom (60; 100)
situated outside the receiving surface (70; 102) to the upper container edge.
Container according to claim 10, characterised in that the further side parts (64,
68) extend from lateral edges of a second receiving surface (72) corresponding in

shape to printed products on the bottom (60) and their inner surfaces form bearing
surfaces preventing substantially lateral displacement of printed products deposited

on the second receiving surface (72).
Container according to claim 11, characterised in that the second receiving surface
(72) has a different shape from the first.
Container according to one of claims 8 to 12, characterised in that, at least in the
region of one of the lateral edges of one of the receiving surfaces (70, 72; 102), the 

side parts (62 to 68; 104 to 136) extending therefrom form a continuous side wall
of the container (26).
Container according to claim 13, characterised in that the side parts (106, 122) are
provided in the region of opposing lateral edges of the receiving surface (102) with

notches (148) extending from the upper container edge.
Container according to one of claims 8 to 14, characterised by a design allowing
for stacking one inside the other.
Container according to claim 15, characterised in that the container (26) can be
received by means of a region of its side wall extending from the bottom (60, 100)

to an upper container edge adjacent to the bottom (60, 100) in the upper region of
the interior of a container of identical design.
Container according to claim 16, characterised in that at least two side parts (62 to
68; 104 to 136) include an obtuse angle with the container bottom (60; 100).
Container according to one of claims 8 to 17, characterised by a design allowing
for stacking one on top of the other.
Container according to claim 18, characterised in that the upper container edge is

in the form of a receiver (142) for the laterally fixed stacking of a container of
identical design.
Container according to one of claims 8 to 19, characterised in that the container
bottom (60; 100) is substantially rectangular and the side parts (62 to 68; 104 to

136) enclose a substantially square volume.
Container according to one of claims 8 to 20, characterised in that an outwardly
projecting, preferably circumferential gripping bar (76; 142) is formed on the upper

container edge.
Container according to one of claims 8 to 21, characterised in that at least one
receiver (74, 146) for torsion-resistant coupling to a rotary table (28) rotatable

about an axis extending perpendicularly to the container bottom (60; 100) is
arranged in the container bottom (60; 100). 
Container according to claim 22, characterised in that the receiver (74; 146) is in
the form of a through opening in the container bottom (60; 100).
Container according to one of claims 8 to 23, characterised in that a guide
arrangement (150) for guiding the container (26) along a guide means on a

transport means serving for the lateral displacement of the container is arranged on
