<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to topically administrable zinc phthalocyanine pharmaceutical 
compositions which are especially useful in the treatment of psoriasis. The therapeutic use of zinc phthalocyanine complex in photodynamic chemotherapy for 
the treatment of tumours is known. J. D. Spikes, Photochem. Photobiol, 43,691 (1986) 
describes the administration of zinc phthalocyanine complex intraperitoneally to mice or 
rats in vivo in the form of an aqueous suspension and the irradiation of the carcinoma 
induced in the animals with high energy light, preferably concentrated visible light from a 
laser. The use of intraperitoneal administration in human therapy generally gives rise to problems 
because of the pain caused by piercing of the abdominal cavity and the great demands made 
on the skill of the physician. Attempts have therefore been made to find alternative 
parenteral dosage forms which are more acceptable to the patient but are also capable of 
ensuring systemic distribution of the zinc phthalocyanine complex.
 
In EP 0451103 there are described intravenously administrable liposome dispersions 
comprising the zinc phthalocyanine complex and one or more synthetic phospholipids, 
particularly for use in the treatment of tumours. It has now been found that topical administration of the zinc phthalocyanine complex to 
human skin can result in penetration of the complex into the epidermis to facilitate the use 
of the complex in the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis by 
photodynamic therapy in which irradiation of the treated skin kills the hyperproliferative 
basal cell layer. Topical application of the complex avoids the need to photosensitise the 
entire skin; the topical composition need be applied only to affected areas of the skin. The formulation of topically administrable dosages of the zinc phthalocyanine complex 
has proved problematic, mixtures of the complex with many solubilising agents failing to 
show significant skin penetration. It has now been found, in accordance with the present 
invention, that by formulating the complex with certain selected carriers, a stable topically  
 
administrable gel can be produced which exhibits sufficient skin penetration for it to be 
used in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases such as psoriasis by photodynamic 
therapy. Accordingly, the present invention provides a topically administrable pharmaceutical 
composition comprising (A) zinc phthalocyanine complex, (B) as carrier for the complex,
