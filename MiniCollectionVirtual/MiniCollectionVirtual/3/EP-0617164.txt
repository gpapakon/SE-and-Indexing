<ABSTRACT>
Uncreped throughdried cellulosic webs having high smoothness 
and stretch are produced by transferring a newly formed web 

from the forming fabric to a slower moving, high fiber 
support transfer fabric, preferably using a fixed gap 

noncompressive transfer. The web is then transferred to a 
throughdrying fabric and throughdried to final dryness, 

producing a web having an improved softness due to increased 
surface smoothness.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the manufacture of paper products such as towels, wipers and 
the like, a wide variety of product characteristics must be 
given attention in order to provide a final product with the 
appropriate blend of attributes suitable for the product's 
intended purpose. Among these various attributes, improving 
surface feel, strength, absorbency, bulk and stretch have 
always been major objectives. Traditionally, many of these 
paper products have been made using a wet-pressing process in 
which a significant amount of water is removed from a wet laid 
web by pressing or squeezing water from the web prior to final 
drying. In particular, while supported by an absorbent 
papermaking felt, the web is squeezed between the felt and the 
surface of a rotating heated cylinder (Yankee dryer) using a 
pressure roll as the web is transferred to the surface of the 
Yankee dryer for final drying. The dried web is thereafter 
dislodged from the Yankee dryer with a doctor blade (creping), 
which serves to partially debond the dried web by breaking many 
of the bonds previously formed during the wet-pressing stages 
of the process. Creping can greatly improve the feel of the 
web, but at the expense of a significant loss in strength. A method for forming a paper web from an aqueous slurry of 
papermaking fibers, using a Yankee dryer is disclosed in US-A-4,440,597. 
According to this document, a web of low fiber 
consistency is forwarded on a foraminous member to a 
differential velocity transfer zone. Subsequent to said 
transfer, the web is dried by aid of a Yankee dryer. A further 
method using a Yankee dryer is described in US-A-4,849,054. 
Said document describes the manufacture of a fibrous sheet 
material. More recently, throughdrying has become an alternate means of 
drying paper webs. Throughdrying provides a relatively  
 
noncompressive method of removing water from the web by passing 
hot air through the web until it is dry. More specifically, a 
wet-laid web is transferred from the forming fabric to a 
coarse, highly permeable throughdrying fabric and retained on 
the throughdrying fabric until dry. The resulting dried web is 
softer and bulkier than a conventionally-dried uncreped sheet 
because fewer bonds are formed and because the web is less 
compressed. Squeezing water from the wet web is eliminated, 
although the use of a pressure roll to subsequently transfer 
the web to a Yankee dryer for creping may still be used. EP-A-0342646 
describes a method for making hand or wiper towels 
using a throughdryer

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a cellulosic web comprising:
 
depositing an aqueous suspension of papermaking fibers onto 

the surface of an endless travelling foraminous forming 
fabric to form a wet web having a consistency of from 15 to 

25 percent; transferring the wet web from the forming 
fabric to a first transfer fabric travelling at a speed 

slower than the forming fabric;
 
characterized by 


transferring the wet web from the first transfer fabric 
optionally via at least one further transfer fabric to a 

drying fabric, whereon the web is noncompressively dried; 
whereby the wet web is transferred from the forming fabric 
to the first transfer fabric with a fixed gap between the 

forming fabric and the first transfer fabric, the fixed gap 
having a span equal to or greater than the thickness of the 

web leaving the forming fabric, whereby the wet web is not 
compressed during the transfer; and 
whereby said first transfer fabric preferably travels at a 
speed of 5 to 75 percent slower than the forming fabric. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the drying fabric is a 
throughdrying fabric and the web is throughdried.  

 
The method of Claim 2 wherein the throughdried web is 

transferred from the throughdrying fabric to a relatively 
smooth carrier fabric and thereafter compressed in a fixed 

gap between the carrier fabric and another relatively 
smooth fabric to control and reduce the caliper of the 

dried web. 
The method of Claim 2 or 3 wherein the throughdried web is 
compressed in two or more fixed gaps, each successive fixed 

gap being smaller than the previous fixed gap. 
The method of Claim 2, 3 or 4 wherein the throughdried web 
is compressed in three or more fixed gaps. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
wet web is transferred from the first transfer fabric to a 

second transfer fabric prior to throughdrying. 
The method of Claim 6 wherein the second transfer fabric is 
travelling at a slower speed than the first transfer 

fabric. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
transfer of the web from the first transfer fabric to the 

throughdrying fabric is carried out with a fixed gap 
between the transfer fabric and the throughdrying fabric, 

the fixed gap having a span equal to or greater than the 
thickness of the web leaving the transfer fabric, whereby 

the web is not compressed during the transfer. 
A method of making a cellulosic web comprising:
 
transferring the wet web from a forming fabric to a drying 

fabric, travelling at a speed slower than the forming 
fabric and noncompressively drying the web;
  
 

characterized by 

maintaining a fixed gap between the forming fabric and the 
drying fabric, wherein the fixed gap between the forming 

fabric and the drying fabric has a span equal to or greater 
than the thickness of the web leaving the forming fabric, 
whereby the drying fabric is travelling at a speed of from 
5 to 75 percent slower than the forming fabric.
