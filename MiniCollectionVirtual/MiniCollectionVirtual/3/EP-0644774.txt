<ABSTRACT>
Improved methods for recombinant production of human reproductive hormones are disclosed. These methods involve the use of animal-derived cells that contain regulated secretory granules as host cells for expression systems capable of expressing DNA encoding human reproductive hormones or their  beta  subunits.

<DESCRIPTION>
 I PROVED PRODUCTION OF REPRODUCTIVE HORMONESThis invention was made with government support under NIH Contract No. NOl-HD-9-2922 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.Technical FieldThe invention..relates to methods for recombinant production o human reproductive hormones with glycosylation patterns more closely related to native patterns than generally obtainable in transformed cells. In particular, it concerns production of recombinant hormones under conditions which result in efficient production and secretion and which regulate the glycosylation pattern of the protein.Background ArtHuman reproductive function is controlled in part by a family of heterodimeric human glycoprotein hormones which have a common a subunit, but differ in their hormone-specific β subunits: The family includes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) , luteinizing hormone (LH) , thyrotropin or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) , and human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) . In all cases, the ex subunit is a 92 amino acid glycoprotein with two canonical glycosylation sites at the asparagines located at positions 52 and 78. The β subunits are also glycoproteins; in addition to the N-linked glycosylation exhibited by the β chains of all four hormones, human CG contains four ucin-like O-linked oligosaccharides attached to a carboxy-terminal extension unique to this hormone. The relevance of the O-linked glycosylation is not, apparently, related to the secretion and assembly of 

the hormone (Matzuk, M.M. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1987) 14:6354-6358).Genomic and cDNA clones have been prepared corresponding to the human chain (Boothby, M. et al. J Biol Chem (1981) 256:5121-5127; Fiddes, J.C. et al. J Mol App Genet (1981) jL:3-18) . The cDNA and/or genomic sequences of the β subunits have also been prepared. For CG, the S-encoding DNA is described by Fiddes, J.C. et al. Nature (19aθ)_ 286:684-687 and by Policastro, P. et al. J Biol Chem (1983) 258:11492-11499. For luteinizing hormone, hereto , such description is by Boorstein, W.R. et al. Nature (1982) 3C L-.419-422; and for TSH by Hayashizaki, Y. et al. FEBS Lett (1985) 188.:394-400 and by Whitfield,- G.K. et al. in "Frontiers in Thyroidology", (1986) Medeiros-Nato, G. et al. (eds) pages 173-176,Plenum Press, NY. These DNA segments have been expressed recombinantly, and biologically active material has been produced.The genomic sequence encoding FSH-3 chain was used to construct a recombinant expression vector containing
