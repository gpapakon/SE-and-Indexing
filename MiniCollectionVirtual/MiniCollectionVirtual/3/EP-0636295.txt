<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to line interface circuits for telecommunications lines. Line 
interface circuits are commonly connected to two-wire telephone subscriber lines at a 
telephone central office or remote terminal in order to provide a variety of well-known 
desired functions. Various forms of line interface circuit, and various desirable features in line 
interface circuits, are known. In particular, it is known for example from Rosenbaum 
United States Patent No. 4,484,032 issued November 20, 1984 and entitled "Active 
Impedance Transformer Assisted Line Feed Circuit" to provide a line interface circuit in 
which two amplifiers have their outputs coupled to the tip and ring wires of a two-wire 
telephone line via feed resistors and primary windings of a very small transformer. In this 
arrangement, a secondary winding of the transformer and a resistive network coupled to 
the feed resistors provide for sensing of a.c. and d.c. conditions on the line. With evolution of telephone systems, it is desirable to provide improved line 
interface circuits which in particular have a bandwidth which is sufficiently great to 
accommodate ISDN (integrated services digital network) services, for example a signal 
bandwidth of the order of 200 kHz. At the same time, it is desirable to provide 
improvements in line interface circuits with respect to such features as their size, cost, 
versatility, and operation especially in relation to fault conditions, common mode signal 
rejection, and power consumption and dissipation. Considered generally, there is a need for a line interface circuit which can be used 
to operate in conjunction with any arbitrary telephone communications line to provide 
arbitrary voice and data communications services as may be desired at any particular time, 
which services can be readily changed under software control from a telephone central 
office processor without requiring any hardware changes of the line interface circuit. While the line interface circuit described in United States Patent No. 4,484,032 
provides considerable advantages over other line interface circuits, in particular in 
allowing precise longitudinal balance and the use of a very small transformer facilitating 
improved noise performance and bandwidth which is independent of the resistance values 
used in the resistive network, which accordingly can be high to minimize power 
consumption and dissipation, nevertheless some disadvantages remain, in particular 
relating to noise susceptibility, a residual
