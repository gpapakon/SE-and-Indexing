<ABSTRACT>
This process consists of making the opening cross-section (2) subject to, on the one hand and mainly, the difference between the quantity of water vapour contained in the air of the room (Vi) and the quantity of water vapour in the outside air (Ve), so that the opening cross-section increases when this difference increases, and, on the other hand, in an independent manner, to the quantity of water vapour in the outside air. Application to the ventilation of rooms.

A process for adjusting the cross-section of the opening of an air inlet into premises,
characterised in that it comprises subjecting the cross-section of the opening (2) partly and

mainly to the difference between the quantity of water vapour contained in the air in the
premises (Vi) and the quantity of water vapour in the outside air (Ve), so that the cross-section

of the opening increases as this difference increases, and partly, optionally and
independently, to the quantity of water vapour in the outside air.
A method of adjustment according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises
measuring the relative humidities of the air in the premises and the outside air respectively at

temperatures which are as close as possible to each other and largely independent of the
outside temperature.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that it consists of increasing the cross-section
of the opening (2) when the quantity of water vapour in the outside air increases.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises reducing the cross-section
of the opening when the quantity of water vapour in the outside air increases.
A device for implementing the method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that it comprises two enclosures (Ve, Vi) communicating with the outside air

and the air within the premises respectively, designed so that heat exchange is very much
greater via the walls than via the air, separated from each other by a heat exchanger (5) which

is water-vapour-tight and balances their respective temperatures, the two enclosures
containing two bundles of fibres sensitive to humidity (Fe, Fi) which are kept under tension by

a spring (10) and are connected by a drive mechanism (12, 13) to at least one shutter (15, 16)
adjusting the cross-section of the opening (2) of the air inlet into the premises, the drive

mechanism (12, 13) being controlled by the relative movement of the two bundles (Fe, Fi) and
also by their joint movement. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that one end of each bundle (Fe, Fi) is
fixed, while the other end is mounted outside the enclosure containing the bundle of fibres in

question on a piece (8) in the form of a pivoting arm which while being mounted on an axis (9)
located at the end of the exchanger about which it can pivot, is connected directly or indirectly

to at least one shutter (15, 16, 36) adjusting the cross-section of the air inlet opening (2, 32).
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the end of at least one cable (12, 13)
whose other end is fixed to a shutter (16, 15) mounted in the air inlet opening (2) is fixed to

the piece (8) in the form of a pivoting arm.
A device according to both claims 3 and 6, characterised in that the ends of two cables
(12, 13) whose other ends are fixed to two shutters (15, 16) mounted in the air inlet opening

(2), hinged about the same axis (17) so that in one position they lie flat against each other, one
(16) of the shutters being solid and the other (15) having at least one central opening (18)

which can be obstructed to a greater or lesser extent by the first shutter (16), are attached to

the piece (8) in the shape of a pivoting arm and the support thereof respectively.
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the piece (8) in the form of a
pivoting arm is integral with a lever (22) acting on a mixer valve (23, 24) for two different air

pressures, the mixed pressure being received within a deformable envelope (34) acting on a
shutter (36) mounted in the air inlet opening (32).
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that the pressures inside and outside the
premises are different, and are used to feed the mixer valve (23, 24).
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that the mixer valve comprises a piston
(23), the end of which bears on a lever (22) fixed to the piece (8) in the shape of a pivoting

arm, the piston (23) comprising a transverse opening (33) to provide adjustable
communication, according to its axial position, between two enclosures (26, 27) at different

pressures (P'+, P-) and an enclosure (30) at the mixed pressure (Pm).
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that each bundle of fibres sensitive to
humidity (Fe, Fi) is fixed at one of its ends to a fixed point and at its other end, subject to the

action of a spring, (40, 42) to a piece (43, 44) which is mounted so as to pivot about an axis
(A), this axis being common to the two pieces, perpendicular to the two bundles of fibres and 

parallel to the plane of the air inlet opening, the piece (43) fixing the bundle (Fe) located in the
enclosure (Ve) in communication with the outside air also having an axis (B) about which the

shutter (46) adjusting the cross-section of the air inlet passage hinges, this axis (B) being
substantially parallel to the bundles of fibres (Fe, Fi), while the piece (44) fixing the bundle (Fi)

located in the enclosure (Vi) bears the end of a lever (47) whose other end is mounted on the
outside of the shutter (46).
A device according to claim 12, characterised in that the shutter (46) is fitted with a
return spring (48) by means of which a minimum opening may be maintained by compensating

for the pressure in the air delivery duct.
