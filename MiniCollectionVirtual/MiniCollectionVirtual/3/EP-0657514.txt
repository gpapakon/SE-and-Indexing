<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous dispersions of fluoropolymers which are obtained by emulsion polymerisation, cannot be processed from the melt, and form films on sintering, comprising a fluoropolymer A) having an average particle size (number average) of from 180 to 400 nm and a fluoropolymer B) having an average particle size which is lower by a factor of from about 0.3 to about 0.7, so that the total dispersion has a nonmonomodal numerical distribution of the particle diameter, are suitable for soaking, impregnating or coating surfaces, for example of fibres or planiform articles of fibres or porous materials, in particular for coating fibreglass fabrics, and also for the formulation of metal coating systems.

<CLAIMS>
An aqueous dispersion of fluoropolymers which are 
obtained by emulsion polymerization, are not processable 

from the melt and form a film on sintering, 
which com
prise a fluoropolymer A) having an average 
particle size (number average) of from 180 to 400 nm 

and a fluoropolymer B) having an average particle 
size which is lower by a factor of from about 0.3 to 

about 0.7, so that the total dispersion has a non-monomodal 
number distribution of the particle 

diameter. 
A dispersion as claimed in claim 1, comprising, 
based on the polymer solids content, from 50 to 95 % 

by weight, preferably from 70 to 95 % by weight, of 
fluoropolymer A) and from 5 to 50 % by weight, 

preferably from 5 to 30 % by weight, of 
fluoropolymer B). 
A dispersion as claimed in one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein the fluoropolymer solids 

content is from 10 to 80 % by weight, preferably 
from 30 to 60 % by weight. 
A dispersion as claimed in one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein the fluoropolymer A) has 

an average particle size of from 180 to 300 nm 
and/or the fluoropolymer B) has an average particle 

size of from 50 to 150 nm. 
A dispersion as claimed in one or more of the 
preceding claims, which comprises, based on the 

polymer solids content, from 4 to 15 % by weight of 
a surfactant.  

 
A dispersion as claimed in one or more of the 
preceding claims, which comprises, based on the 

polymer solids content, up to 40 % by weight, 
preferably from 10 to 25 % by weight, of fillers. 
A process for preparing a dispersion as claimed in 
one or more of the preceding claims, which comprises 

mixing an aqueous dispersion of the fluoropolymer A) 
with an aqueous dispersion of the fluoropolymer B) 

and, if desired, concentrating the mixture to the 
desired solids content, preferably to a solids 

content of from 40 to 65 % by weight. 
Use of the dispersions as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 6 for soaking, impregnating or coating 

surfaces. 
Use of the dispersions as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 6 for the formulation of metal coating systems. 
Use of the dispersions as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 6 for soaking or impregnating fibers or 

planiform articles of fibers or porous materials and 
for coating fiberglass fabrics.
