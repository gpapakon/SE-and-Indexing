<ABSTRACT>
The cloning and characterization of a human dopamine transporter (HUDAT) cDNA is described. RFLP analysis is used to determine the distribution of HUDAT alleles in two ethnic backgrounds. The means by which the association between HUDAT alleles and behavioral disorders which have altered HUDAT expression as a basis for their etiology is discussed. Methods for evaluating the expression of HUDAT are described.

 SEQUENCE OF HUMAN DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER CDNARELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 07/762,132, filed September 20, 1991, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention relates to a cloned cDNA which encodes the human dopamine transporter protein. The cloned cDNA provides a means of expressing human dopamine transorter protein in a variety of contexts and also provides a means of diagnosing and treating diseases presenting abnormal expression of dopamine transporter protein.Description of the Related ArtThroughout this application, reference is made to articles of the scientific literature and the like.The entire content of such citations is hereby incorporated by such reference. The dopamine transporter that acts to take released dopamine back up into presynaptic terminals 

has been implicated in several human disorders. Cocaine binds to the dopamine transporter and blocks dopamine reuptake in a fashion that correlates well with cocaine reward and reinforcement (M.C. Ritz et al., Science 237, 1219 (1987)). Neurotoxins that cause Parkinsonian syndromes are concentrated in dopaminergic neurons by this transporter (S.H. Snyder and R.J. D'Amato, Neurology 36, 250 (1986) ; G. Uhl, Eur. J. Neurol. 30, 21 (1990)). Binding to the dopamine transporter is altered in brains of patients with Tourette's syndrome (H.S. Singer et al., Ann. Neurol. 30, 558 (1991)). These clinical links enhance interest in the structure and function of the human dopamine transporter (HUDAT) . Vulnerability to these disorders may have genetic components (E.J. Devor and C.R. Cloninger, Annu. Rev. Genet. 23, 19 (1989) ; D. Pauls and J. Leckman, New Eng. J. Med. 315, 993 (1986); R. Pickens et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 48, 19 (1991)); thus identification of linkage markers for the human DAT is also of interest. Dopamine transporters act to terminate dopaminergic neurotransmission by sodium- and chloride- dependent reaccumulation of dopamine into pre-synaptic neurons (L.L. Iversen, in Handbook of Psychopharmacology, L.L. Iversen, S.J. Iversen, & S.H. Snyder, Eds. (Plenum, New York, 1976), pp. 381-442; M.J. Kuhar and M.A. Zarbin, J. Neurochem. 31, 251 (1978); A.S. Horn, Prog. Neurobiol. 34, 387 (1990)).Cocaine and related drugs bind to these transporters in a fashion that correlates well with their behavioral reinforcing and psychomotor stimulant properties; these transporters are thus the principal
