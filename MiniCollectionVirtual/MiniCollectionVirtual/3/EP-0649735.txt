<ABSTRACT>
The method consists in applying lugs (6,7) extending 
from the sides of sheets (1,2) onto chamfered edges (4) 

of a moulding core (3), along which the different steps of 
the method are carried out. Optionally, the lugs present 

corresponding prolongations (6a,7a). The lugs, previously 
glued, are joined together in order to form chamfered edges 

(8) limited by cant edges (8a) between every two adjacent 
sides (9) of the box. Optionally, beside the chamfered edges 

(8) the lugs (6a/7a) are glued to the sides (9) of the box. 
This chamfered edges and the corresponding cant 
edges lend the box a great stiffness and resistance to 

withstand the compression stresses to which it may be subjected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method for 
manufacturing cardboard boxes, and to a box obtained with 
this method. A method for manufacturing cardboard boxes, which 
is described in Spanish Patent application no. 9300188 
(PAPER, S.A.), publication number ES 2067382, starts from separate sheets, with lugs on the 
sides and flaps at the ends facing each other two by two. 
These sheets are applied onto the external faces of a 
mandrel, along which the various steps of the method are 
carried out to provide a rectangular prismatic body whose 
bases are provided with open flaps and whose edges are 
reinforced by folded lugs glued to the sides of the body, 
beside the edges. In addition to achieving reinforced boxes capable 
of withstanding the stresses to which they will be subjected 
during utilization, the method object of the aforesaid 
patent provides other advantages which are, in summary: the 
possibility of some sides of the box being of different 
quality and thickness than the others, or presenting fibres 
running in different directions in order to withstand 
stresses in any direction. Despite these advantages, various tests carried out 
with this type of box have shown that it is possible to 
increase their strength and thus extend their field of 
utilization.  
 Thus, in order to increase the strength of the 
boxes manufactured using the method described, the new 
method constituting the object of the present invention has 
been developed. The method of the invention is characterized in 
that the lugs which project from the sides of the sheets are 
applied and joined together over chamfered edges provided on 
the mandrel. These chamfered edges are situated between two 
adjacent sides of the mandrel. At least one of the pairs of sheets from which the 
box is obtained presents prolongations from the respective 
lugs. These prolongations are applied and joined to an 
adjacent zone of the sheet, immediately beside the chamfered 
edges upon which the lugs in question are applied. In one possible embodiment, all the sheets from 
which the box is obtained present prolongations from their 
respective lugs. These prolongations are applied and joined 
to a zone of the sheet immediately adjacent to the chamfered 
edges upon which the lugs in question are applied. The box obtained with the method described is 
provided with chamfered edges (or chamfers) between its sides 
and on which are superimposed and glued the folded lugs of 
the adjacent sheets, forming two cant edges between each 
pair of sheets.

A method for manufacturing cardboard boxes, 
which consists in starting from separate sheets (1, 2) with 

lugs (6, 7) on the sides and flaps at the ends, facing each 
other two by two; these sheets are applied onto the external 

faces of a long mandrel (3) having a cross-section equivalent 
to that of the boxes to be obtained and along which the 

various steps of the method are carried out to provide a 
prismatic body whose bases are provided with open flaps and 

whose edges are reinforced by folded lugs glued to the cant 
edges of the sides of the body, 
characterized
 in that the 
lugs (6, 7) which project from the sides of the sheets (1, 

2) are applied and joined together over chamfered edges (4) 
provided on the
 mandrel (3) to form a chamfer (8) and two cant edges (8a) 
between each pair of sheets; these chamfered edges are 

situated between two adjacent sides (5) of the mandrel (3). 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one of the pairs of sheets (1, 2) from which 

the box is obtained presents prolongations (6a) from the 
respective lugs (6), said prolongations being applied and 

joined to a zone of the adjacent sheet, immediately beside 
the chamfered edges (4) upon which the lugs in question are 

applied. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that all the sheets (1, 2) from which the box is obtained 

present prolongations (6a, 7a) from their respective lugs 
(6, 7), said prolongations being applied and joined to a 

zone of the adjacent sheet, immediately beside the chamfered 
edges (4) upon which the lugs in question are applied.  

 
A cardboard box, 
made from separate sheets (1, 2) with 

lugs (6, 7) on the sides and flaps at the ends, facing each 
other two by two; these sheets being formed 

to provide a 
prismatic body whose bases are provided with open flaps and 

whose side edges are reinforced by folded lugs glued to the 
edge portions of the sides of the body, 
characterized
 in that the 
lugs (6, 7) which project from the sides of the sheets (1, 

2) are joined together so as to form chamfers (8) along the 
sides (9) of the box  

 
and in that the chamfers 

(8) along the sides (9) of the box, on which 
are superimposed and glued the folded lugs (6, 7) of the 

adjacent sheets, form two cant edges (8a) between each 
pair of sheets.  

 
A box according to claim 
4, characterized in that at least one of the superimposed 

lugs (6) forming the chamfered edges (8) of the box 
presents a prolongation (6a) folded and glued onto the 

adjacent side, beside the chamfered edges (8). 
A box according to claim 
4, characterized in that all the superimposed lugs (6, 

7) which form the chamfered edges (8) of the box present 
corresponding prolongations (6a, 7a) folded and glued onto 

the adjacent side, beside the chamfered edges.
