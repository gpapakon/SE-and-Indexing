<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable steering column for a vehicle having a steering 
column (1) includes adjustment means, for example a clampable 

mechanism (4, 4A, 4B), to allow for reach adjustment of the 
steering column and for clamping the column at a desired reach 

position. 
Energy absorption means (5) are provided to absorb energy upon 
collapse of the steering column in a crash situation, there 

being a resilient-loaded pawl and ratchet mechanism (6, 7, 8) 
associated with the adjustment means, acting as a primary 

means in the crash situation to transfer energy from the 
column to the energy absorption means. A handle (9) acts both 

to clamp and unclamp the adjustment means and to bring the 
pawl and ratchet mechanism into and out of engagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adjustable steering column 
assembly for a vehicle. With steering columns which have a reach adjustable facility, 
i.e. a facility where the steering wheel can be adjusted 
towards and away from the driver for optimum comfort, there is 
also the need to ensure that, in a crash situation, energy 
transmitted through the steering column to an energy 
absorption system upon steering column collapse is transmitted 
satisfactorily. In other words, the reach adjustment means 
needs to remain locked, or substantially so, so that steering 
column collapse energy can be transmitted directly to the 
energy absorption means. GB-A-2 116 496 discloses an adjustable steering column 
assembly in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. US-A-4 793 204 also discloses an adjustable steering column 
and includes a tilt lock mechanism and a telescopic lock 
mechanism, both lock mechanisms including pawl and ratchet 
devices. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
adjustable steering column assembly for a vehicle, comprising 
a steering column, adjustment means to allow for reach 
adjustment of the column and for clamping the column at a 
desired reach position, energy absorption means to absorb 
energy upon collapse of said steering column in a crash 
situation, characterised in that the energy absorption means  
 
is mounted on a part of the vehicle and in that the steering 
column assembly further comprises a resiliently-loaded pawl 
and ratchet mechanism associated with said adjustment means 
acting as a primary means in the crash situation to transmit 
energy from the column to said energy absorption means, and 
being resiliently loaded for locking engagement. Preferably, there is a single actuating member to actuate said 
adjustment means and to bring the pawl and ratchet mechanism 
into and out of engagement.  
 For a better understanding of the invention and to show how 
the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be 
made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:- 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of an adjustable steering 
column assembly for a vehicle, the assembly being shown in a 
normal condition in which the column is held in an adjusted 
position with pawl and ratchet mechanism engaged, Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing the 
condition of the assembly to allow free reach adjustment of 
the steering column, Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 1 and showing a condition 
of the assembly at commencement of a crash
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An adjustable steering column assembly for a vehicle, 
comprising a steering column (1), adjustment means (4, 4A, 4B) 

to allow for reach adjustment of the column and for clamping 
the column at a desired reach position, energy absorption 

means (5) to absorb energy upon collapse of said steering 
column in a crash situation, characterised in that the energy 

absorption means (5) is mounted on a part of the vehicle and 
in that the steering column assembly further comprises a 

resiliently-loaded pawl and ratchet mechanism (6, 7, 8) 
associated with said adjustment means acting as a primary 

means in the crash situation to transmit energy from the 
column (1) to said energy absorption means, and being 

resiliently loaded for locking engagement. 
An assembly according to claim 1 and comprising a single 
actuating member (9) to actuate said adjustment means and to 

bring the pawl and ratchet mechanism out of engagement and to 
allow it under the resilient bias into engagement. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
adjustment means includes cam means (4A) to clamp the steering 

column in a desired reach position, said cam means causing a 
bracket (4B) of said adjustment means to clamp the steering 

column. 
An assembly according to claim 3, wherein said bracket 
(4B) is coupled to said energy absorption means (5), which 

itself is mounted on a part of the vehicle.  
 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said pawl and ratchet mechanism includes a ratchet 

teeth block (6) fixed to part of the steering column (1). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said pawl and ratchet mechanism includes a to
othed 
pawl (7), which is resiliently loaded towards the ratchet 

mechanism.
