<ABSTRACT>
An active noise attenuating device includes a first 
microphone (22) located in a propagation path (21) of noise, 

a loud speaker (23) located downstream from the first 
microphone (22), a second microphone (24) located downstream 

from the loud speaker (23) for receiving sound, and an 
operational unit (26) for executing an operation on the 

basis of a detection signal from the first microphone (22) 
to generate a control signal supplied to the loud speaker 

(23) so that a sound interfering with the noise is produced. 
An operational factor of the operational unit (26) is 

controlled by an adaptive controller (33) on the basis of 
the detection signal from the second microphone (24) so that 

an amount of noise attenuated by the sound produced from the 
loud speaker (23) is rendered maximum. A transfer 

characteristic of a transfer path between the loud speaker 
(23) and the second microphone (24) is identified on the 

basis of the detection signals generated by the second 
microphone (24) when a sound represented by a periodical 

identifying signal is produced in a plurality of periods. 
An operational factor of the adaptive controller (33) is 

adjusted by an adaptive control identifying unit (40) on the 
basis of the identified transfer characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention as defined in the preamble of claim 1
relates to an active noise attenuating
device provided in a propagation path of noise for producing
a sound having the same amplitude as that of the noise and a
phase opposite to the noise, to cause a sound interference
between the noise and the produced sound, thereby
attenuating the noise.An active noise attenuating device has recently been
proposed for attenuating noise produced by an air
conditioner and propagating along a draft duct thereof. The
active noise attenuating device produces a sound having the
same amplitude as that of the noise and a phase opposite to
the noise to cause a sound interference in the draft duct,
thereby actively attenuating the noise and reducing an
amount of noise leaking out of the draft duct.An active noise attenuating technique applied to the
above-described device employs applied electronic techniques
and particularly, an acoustic data processing circuit
arrangement and acoustic interference. In this active noise
attenuating technique, basically, a sound receiver such as a
microphone is provided in the draft duct to detect the sound
from a noise source, thereby converting the detected sound
to a corresponding electrical signal. The electrical signal
is processed into a signal by an operation unit. The signal
is supplied to a control sound producer such as a loud
speaker so that it produces an artificial sound having the 
same amplitude as of the noise and the phase opposite to the
noise, at a control point and so that the artificial sound
interferes with the noise at the control point. The document
GB-A-2 222 501 discloses such an active noise attenuating device.
Consequently, an attenuation efficiency can be expected to
amount to 10 dB or more in a low frequency band in the
above-described device. Moreover, no pressure loss occurs
in the above noise attenuating device. For example, when a
concert hall is equipped with the above-described active
noise attenuating device, noise produced from the draft
ducts can be attenuated such that a better space can be
provided for appreciation of music.In employment of the active noise control in practice,
characteristic variations due to aged deterioration of parts
composing the signal system and due to an ambient
temperature need to be coped with. For this purpose, an
operational factor or acoustic transfer function of the
operation unit is adjusted in accordance with variations in
the noise attenuating performance of the device. More
specifically, a monitoring sound receiver
