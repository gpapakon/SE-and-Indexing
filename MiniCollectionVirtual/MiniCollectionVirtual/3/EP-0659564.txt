<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide 
an ink jet recording head and an apparatus using the 

same, wherein electrothermal conversion element for 
thermally emitting a recording ink is provided at a 

side of a substrate on which the head structure is 
formed, thereby reducing a loss in the thermal energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet head for discharging
ink from a plurality of discharge orifices.EP-A-0 454 155 describes an ink jet head for discharging ink
from a plurality of discharge orifices comprising a plurality of
electricity-heat conversion elements for generating the heat
energy to be applied to the ink and function elements for
driving the electricity-heat converters, wherein the element
substrate has a plurality of grooves constituting the ink flow
passage for supplying the ink to the discharge orifices. Conventionally, the constitution of recording
heads has been made such that an array of electricity-heat
conversion elements is formed on a single crystal
silicon substrate, function elements for driving the
electricity-heat conversion elements such as a
transistor array are arranged outside the silicon
substrate as a drive circuit for the electricity-heat
conversion elements, and the connection between the
electricity-heat conversion elements and the transistor
array is made by wire bonding.For the purposes of providing a simplified
structure to be considered for the above head
constitution, reducing the failure which may arise in 
the manufacturing process, or providing the uniform
characteristic or improved reproducibility for each
element, an ink jet recording apparatus is known which
has a recording head having electricity-heat conversion
elements and function elements provided on the same
substrate, as proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 57-72867.Fig. 16 is a typical cross-sectional view
showing a part of a recording head substrate as
constituted above. 901 is a semiconductor substrate
composed of single crystal silicon. 902 is an epitaxial
region of N-type semiconductor, 903 is an ohmic contact
region of N-type semiconductor having a high impurity
density, 904 is a base region of P-type semiconductor,
and 905 is an emitter region of N-type semiconductor
having a high impurity density, whereby a bipolar
transistor 920 is formed of them. 906 is an oxide
silicon layer serving as a heat storing layer and an
insulating interlayer, 907 is a heating resistive layer,
908 is a wiring electrode made of aluminum (Al), 909
is an oxide silicon layer as a protective layer,
whereby a recording head base body 930 is formed of
them. Here, 940 serves as a heating portion. A
recroding head is constructed by a ceiling plate and
the liquid channels formed on this base body 930.By the way, the structure as described above
may be superior, but there is yet much room for 
improve
