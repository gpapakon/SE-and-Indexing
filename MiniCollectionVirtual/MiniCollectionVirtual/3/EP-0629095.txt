<ABSTRACT>
A cellular mobile radio system arranged to operate in 
accordance with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, 

wherein at least some frames on a down-link (base station to 
mobile) include a slot, hereinafter called a fast paging slot (FP slot) 

reserved for information which indicates to a mobile the 
information slots in which to listen for the reception of 

information, and wherein at least some frames on an up-link 
(mobile to base station) are arranged to include an FP 

acknowledgement signal by means of which a mobile 
acknowledges receipt of FP information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellular mobile radio systems which
include a packet reservation multiple access (PRMA) protocol.Systems which use such a protocol are described or referred
to in our co-pending Patent Application No GB 9219824.1
(F20927) to which attention is hereby directed.Future mobile radio systems will be required to support
both voice and data services. Furthermore, in order to support
some services, a facility allowing dynamic assignment of capacity
during a call is required, as for example, with a video codec.
Hence a scheme for implementing such systems should provide a
facility for allocating channel capacity on demand from a mobile.
In addition, in order to make the most efficient use of the scarce
spectral resource, a mobile's logical channel which does not
experience activity should not occupy capacity on the channel.
Hence, although a logical connection may be maintained between a
mobile and a base station, a physical connection is preferably not
made unless traffic is generated on that logical channel.In the case where communication is required on a down-link
(base station to mobile) the physical connection of a logical
channel should be made which has a capacity which is able to
satisfy the instantaneous demands to deliver the activity on the
channel. The number of time slots in a time division multiple
access (TDMA) frame, should be such that the instantaneous
capacity demanded by the channel is satisfied. That is to say, if a 
high bit rate user requires n-time slots, then these slots must be reserved for the
base station to broadcast to the mobile. However, the mobile needs to be informed
of the time slots to which it should listen. In order to receive this information,
appertaining to the time slots to which it should listen, a special mechanism is
required, otherwise a mobile would need to be switched on so as to be alert at all
times. This is clearly impracticable and undesirable in view of the battery drain
which would be involved, and the radio resource that would have to be
permanently assigned, which could not be tolerated for hand portable units for
example.It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide such a
mechanism which is economical of mobile battery energy, and to improve the
utilisation of the radio resource.The article entitled "A new radio access protocol and network architecture
for mobile packet data" (41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, 19 May
1991, St. Louis, MO, US, pages 399-407, XP000260211) describes a cellular
mobile

<CLAIMS>
A cellular mobile radio system arranged to operate in accordance with a
packet reservation multiple access protocol, said cellular radio system having a

down-link divided into a plurality of time slots for transmission of data from a base
station to mobile stations and at least one Fast Paging slot (FP) reserved for

transmission of information appertaining to an address (4a) of a mobile together
with data identifying which of said plurality of time slots data for that mobile will

be subsequently transmitted by said base station consequent upon receipt by said
base station of an FP acknowledgement (F Pack) signal transmitted by said mobile

on an up-link, characterised in that less than one FP slot (FP) per frame is reserved.
A system as claimed in Claim 1, wherein every other frame is arranged to
include an FP slot (FP).
