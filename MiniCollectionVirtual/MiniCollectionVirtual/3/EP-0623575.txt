<ABSTRACT>
Described is a novel process for the preparation of ketones, for example CF3C(O)CH3, CF3C(O)CH2C(O)CF3 and CF3C(O)CF2H. In this process, ss-keto esters are transesterified and decarboxylated with a carboxylic acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid, in the presence of a catalyst, in particular an "onium" salt of a carboxylic acid or an effective amount of a proton-liberating acid, preferably a sulphonic acid such as alkyl- or arylsulphonic acids, or a mineral acid. It is expedient to carry out the process under anhydrous conditions. Therefore, no acetals or hydrates are formed, so that a dehydration step can be dispensed with. A further advantage of the process is the simple procedure. If a sufficiently active carboxylic acid is used for the transesterification reaction, for example trifluoroacetic acid, the presence of an additional catalyst is not required.
