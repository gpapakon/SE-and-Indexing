<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a method for the preparation of cerium carbonate 
containing alkaline earth metal impurities such as calcium and 

barium in a greatly reduced amount as compared with the starting 
cerium compound. The method comprises addition of an aqueous 

solution of a water-soluble carbonate compound, e.g., ammonium 
(hydrogen) carbonate, to an aqueous solution of a water-soluble cerium 

salt, e.g., cerium nitrate, as the precipitation medium of cerium 
carbonate only when the pH value of the precipitation medium 

is in the range from 2.0 to 5.0 so as to greatly decrease coprecipitation 
of the alkaline earth metal impurities with cerium carbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of a cerium carbonate powder. More particularly, the invention relates 
to a method for the preparation of a cerium carbonate powder 
containing a particularly reduced amount of alkaline earth metal 
impurities. Rare earth carbonates including cerium carbonate are sometimes 
required to contain alkaline earth metal impurities such as 
magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium in a particularly reduced 
amount because alkaline earth metal impurities may exhibit 
very adverse influences on the performance of various kinds of 
products derived from cerium carbonate, such as ceramic materials 
for electronic use and optical materials, e.g., scintillators and 
phosphors, even when the impurity level thereof is extremely low 
to be in a so-called trace amount. Rare earth carbonates in general including cerium carbonate 
are purified conventionally by the re-precipitation method in order 
to reduce the content of impurities including alkaline earth metal 
impurities. Namely, a crude rare earth oxide powder is dissolved 
in a mineral acid such as nitric and hydrochloric acid to form an 
acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth salt, into which oxalic 
acid or a water-soluble oxalate is added in the form of an aqueous  
 
solution to precipitate the oxalate of the rare earth element in such 
an acidic pH range at which precipitation of the alkaline earth 
metals hardly takes place followed by the calcination of the rare 
earth oxalate to give a rare earth oxide which is re-dissolved in an 
inorganic acid to give an aqueous solution of the rare earth salt into 
which a water-soluble carbonate is added so as to precipitate the 
rare earth ions in the form of the carbonate of the rare earth element. 
This re-precipitation method, however, is not efficient especially 
when the rare earth element is cerium because no sufficient 
decrease in the content of the alkaline earth metal impurities cannot 
be obtained by the re-precipitation method in addition to the 
problem that, while the above described re-precipitation method 
involves twice of dissolution of a rare earth oxide in an inorganic 
acid, cerium (IV) oxide is dissolved not so readily in an inorganic 
acid taking an unduly long time for complete dissolution to greatly 
decrease the productivity of the process. Although the ion exchange 
method or solvent extraction method can be applied to the 
separation and removal of alkaline earth metal impurities from 
rare earth elements, these methods are
