<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING MULTI-AXIAL NON-WOVEN FABRICThis invention relates to apparatus for producing multi-axial non- woven fabric.The term "multi-axial non-woven fabric" as used herein and the claims hereof means a non-woven textile fabric comprising at least two layers, all of the yarns in each layer being substantially parallel to one another and the yarns in at least said two layers extending in different directions, and stitching extending through said layers, the stitching serving both to connect together said layers and to maintain the parallelity of the yarns in each layer. Such fabrics are well- known in the art and are generally used as reinforcements in articles made from reinforced plastics materials, although they can have uses in other areas such as in the manufacture of window blinds. Examples of such fabrics are those manufactured and sold under the Registered Trademark "COTECH" by Tech Textiles Limited of Andover, Hampshire, England.The term "yarn" or "yarns" as used herein and in the claims hereof means any yarn(s), thread(s), roving(s), tow(s) or fibre(s) whether these be monofilament or multifilament.Generally, multi-axial non-woven fabrics of the kind defined are produced on apparatus comprising a pair of driven parallel endless chain conveyors which extend longitudinally of the apparatus on opposite sides thereof and each of which carries a series of pins, at least two guide rail means spaced longitudinally of the apparatus and extending above and across said chain conveyors, at least one of said guide rail means extending at an oblique angle with respect to said chain conveyors, a yarn carriage mounted on each of said guide rail means for movement therealong, each yarn carriage being adapted to 

carry a plurality of parallel yarns from one of said chain conveyors to the other during each traverse, snogging means associated with each yarn carriage for engaging the yarns with the pins of the appropriate chain conveyor at the end of each traverse and for ensuring that the yarns laid at each traverse are adjacent to and parallel with the yarns laid on the previous traverse whereby to form a layer of non- woven parallel yarns extending at a predetermined angle with respect to the longitudinal centreline of the fabric being formed, and a stitching head extending across the width of the apparatus to which the laid yarns are transported by said conveyor chains, the stitching head serving to stitch together the layers laid by said yarn carriages so that the layers are held together and

CLAIMS:
1. Apparatus for producing multi-axial non-woven fabric as herein defined, the apparatus comprising art endless series of yarn guides having upper and lower reaches extending widthwise of the apparatus, means for driving said series of yarn guides whereby said upper and lower reaches travel in opposite directions, creel means for supplying yarns to said yarn guides, means for rotating said creel means in substantially the same direction and at substantially the same speed as said series of yarn guides to prevent tangling of the yarns supplied to the yarn guides, stitching means extending across the width of the apparatus for stitching together the yarns laid by said yarn guides, and transport means for transporting the laid yarns through said stitching means.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1, comprising two or more endless series of yarn guides each having upper and lower reaches extending widthwise of the apparatus, said two or more series of yarn guides being substantially parallel and arranged one above the other.
3. Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said two or more endless series of yarn guides are of substantially the same length and extend across substantially the full width of the apparatus.
4. Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein two or more of said endless series of yarn guides are of different length.
5. Apparatus according to clai 1 wherein the length of the or each said series of yarn guides is adjustable while the apparatus is in operation to vary the width of the fabric being produced.
6. Apparatus according claim 1 wherein the or each said series of yarn guides is carried by an endless flexible member. 


7. Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said endless flexible member is in the form of an endless chain or band extending around spaced sprockets or pulleys and wherein at least one of said spaced sprockets or pulleys is driven.
8. Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said endless flexible member is in the form of an endless chain or band mounted on a guide rail and driven by sprocket or like means.
9. Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the speed at-which the or each said series of yarn guides is driven relative to the speed at which the laid yarns are transported through said stitching means is variable to vary the angle at which the yarns are laid relative to the longitudinal centreline of the fabric being formed.
10. Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said creel means comprises at least one rotatable creel support having means for mounting a plurality of creels about the periphery thereof.
11. Apparatus according to claim 10, wherein said rotatable creel support is in the form of a wheel, cylindrical frame or carousel.
12. Apparatus according to claim 10 wherein said creel mounting means is such that each creel is rotatable about its own axis.
13. Apparatus according to claim 10 wherein said creel mounting means is such that the axis of each creel remains vertical as said creel support is rotated. 


14. Apparatus according to claim I wherein said stitching means comprises knitting means.
