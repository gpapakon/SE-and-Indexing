<ABSTRACT>
Magnesium chloride, titanium chloride and at least an electron donor 
are introduced in a plasma torch. These chlorides being in solution or 

in suspension in a liquid that can be an electron donor. A very fine 
granulometry powder is collected after cooling. The powder is very 

fine, it has a controlled morphology and it can be used as catalyst 
for alpha-olefins polymerization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for the production of powder
catalysts comprising magnesium chloride and titanium chloride.Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) powder covered with titanium chloride
(TiCl3, TiCl4) is an original material well-known as Ziegler-Natta type
catalysts. The yield of these catalysts depends among other things on
the particle size of the original material; the finer the particles
are, the higher the yield is . There is thus a need for an improved
process for the production of catalyst powders, more particularly of
MgCl2 powder covered with titanium chloride that allows to obtain a
very fine granulometry. In fact, it is particularly difficult to
obtain a very fine granulometry powder by pulverizing MgCl2 under
anhydrous conditions, although this fineness is desired when MgCl2 is
used in the catalysts preparation.The morphology of polymer grains - and consequently, the polymer
apparent density - is among other things determined by the catalyst
morphology. It is then very desirable to be able to control the
morphology of the catalyst powder that is ideally spherical.Patent GB-1279208-A (Standard Telephones; equivalent to DE-2217951-A,
Deutsche ITT) discloses a process of powder production consisting in
vaporizing the material or its components in an inductive coupling
plasma (ICP) then in condensing the vapour.Patent US-4650778-A (Klabunde et al.) shows a process for the
preparation of halogen metal particles consisting in vaporizing them
by heating, then in condensing the vapour in the presence of a
reactive diluant. The obtained solid must be activated by metal alkyls
to be used as catalysts of olefin polymerizations. Belgian Patent BE-1005737-A (filed on 08.05.92 and published on 11.01.94)
claims a process for the production of magnesium powder, characterized in
that it consists essentially in introducing rough powder of magnesium
chloride, with or without titanium chloride in a plasma torch and cooling
the vapour in order to collect a very fine granulometry powder, eventually
by covering this powder with an electron donor during the cooling.The process of the invention for the production of a magnesium chloride
and titanium chloride based powder catalyst essentially consists in the
introduction into a plasma torch (i) of magnesium chloride, (ii) of
titanium chloride and (iii) at least one electron donor, the magnesium
chloride being in solution or in suspension in a liquid L1, the titanium
chloride being in solution or in suspension in a liquid L2 or being liquid
