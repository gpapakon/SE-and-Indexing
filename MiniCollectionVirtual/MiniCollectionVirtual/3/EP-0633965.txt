Two cables (36) are arranged between the upper and lower caps (16, 17) to prevent the cell (10) from being stretched lengthwise. The cell (10) includes two mutually-spaced longitudinal reinforcements (26) arranged opposite the cut to prevent the cell (10) from being deformed therein. A continuous peripheral gap is defined in the cell (10) between the lower ends of the reinforcements (26) and the top of the lower cap. Means are provided for positioning and fitting the sealing device (J) in the expansion joint (E). A method is also provided for fitting the expansion joint (E) in the concrete dam (B) by means of said sealing device (J), wherein the latter is fitted in a bore in the expansion joint (E) with the reinforcements (26) extending in the water flow direction. The cell (10) is then filled and tensioned by means of suitable fluids. An expansion joint is obtained by completing the cut.
