<ABSTRACT>
In a method and a cutting machine according to the invention 
a pile (1) of sheets can be placed on a feeding plane 

and then carried into a given position in the cutting 
machine, wherein a pressing foot (7) secures the pile (1) 

while four cutting knives (11) are pressed down through the 
corners (24) of the pile against lower knives (12), which 

ensures a high cutting capacity and a perfect cutting result, 
the cutting being uniform in the entire height of the 

pile (1). 
The machine may be built up with an adjustable part to the 
effect that the machine can cut in different widths of 

sheet, and the individual knives (11, 12) may be adjustable 
for different lengths of sheet. A universal machine is thus 

provided, which is easily and quickly adjusted for 
different formats, in addition to which it is easily 

operated since the pile (1) can be inserted, cut and removed 
through the machine in a continuous procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cutting machine
according to the preamble of claim 1.An application example of material in the form of a sheet,
e.g. of metalfoil coated cardboard with cut off corners is a
base for food articles, such as sliced fish or meat, which is 
subsequently wrapped into a transparent plastic film to form a
sales package.The rounded corners provide a pleasant impression of the appearance
of the package, and at the same time the rounded corners
protect against damage to the plastic film, in particular
where the film is shrinked onto the package.Furthermore, the rounded corners are used as a natural shape
for e.g. playing cards and other cards, which should be easy
to handle, and where sharp corners would be uncomfortable.Finally, books might be mentioned, including telephone books
and other directories, where sharp corners would be worn or
bent while rounded corners provide an ideal shape for the
pages.Such rounded corners are normally produced in a cutting machine.
An example of a machine of this type is known from DE
Printed Specification no. l.268.588, which relates to a machine
capable of rounding off all four corners in one operation.
This is accomplished by means of four knives, which are
moved down simultaneously, thereby cutting off the corners of
rectangular sheets.This known machine is preadjusted for a specific format size,
for instance playing cards. A pile of rectangular cards are
positioned in a tray having a lateral guide, and four knives
with press rams are then moved downwards, cutting off the four
corners.After completion of the cutting operation the knives and the
press rams are raised, whereupon the ready-cut cards can be
removed from the tray, and a new pile placed into position. The cutting procedure is accomplished alone by means of four
movably mounted knives which sets a limit to the height of the
pile and thus the cutting *p+2Xcapacity of the machine, because the
cutting procedure becomes unprecise and the cuts of inferior
quality if the pile gets too high. This drawback is mainly a
result of insufficient control of the knives near the processing
area.In view hereof, the machine has limited applicability because
it is partly limited for use for particular formats, partly
for manual feeding and removal of the pile of sheets, and finally
the machine has a cutting capacity, which is limited to
a comparatively low pile.From US patent No. 3,125,920 is furthermore known a corner
cutting machine

to the preamble of claim 1.Another machine for rounding the

<CLAIMS>
A cutting machine for automatically cutting of corners (24)
of a pile (1) of preferably identical rectangular sheets of

material, especially of cardboard, paper, fabric, plastic,
metal foil and combinations of such materials, with four cutting

knives (11) being movable between a free position above
the pile (1) and a lower position, whereby the machine comprises;

a feeding plane for placing the pile (1) such that it
is resting with one lateral face against a guide (2) extending

in an longitudinal direction of the machine; a first moving means
(3) for moving the pile (1) along the guide (2) in the longitudinal

direction of the machine into a cutting unit; a pressing
foot (7) movable to and fro between a free position above

the top of the pile and a securing position in which the
pressing foot (7) is being pressed down upon the top of the

pile (1); means for moving the pressing foot (7); means (8)
for moving the cutting knives (11) to and fro between a free

position above the top of the pile and the lower position,
all four corners (24) of the pile (1) being cut simultaneously

when the cutting knives (11) are moved downwards
from their free position to their lower position; and second moving

means (22) for moving the pile (1) out of the cutting unit,
into the same direction as the pile was moved into the cutting

unit, after the pressing foot (7) and the cutting knives
(11) have been returned into their respective free positions by their respective

means, 
characterized
 in that lateral
guides (4) are provided in the cutting unit for guiding the

pile (1) when it is being moved into position
into the cutting unit,

an end stop (5) being being provided which is movable by
means (6) between a stop position in which it can be abutted

by the front side of the pile and a free position above the
pile

the first moving means (3) moving the pile
until the front side of the pile abuts the end stop (5);

in that four lower knives (12) are provided, one under each 
corner of the pile, for supporting the pile during cutting, the shape

of the lower knives (12) being substantially complementary to
the shape of the cutting knives (11) in the regions along

which the cuts are made, such that the cutting knives (11) and
the lower knives (12) can cooperate to provide a shearing action

by moving the cutting knives into a position in which
their cutting edges are below the upper surfaces of the lower

knives, and in that the cutting edges of the cutting knives (11)
are extending along an upwardly directed arc between the outermost

points (24) of the cutting edge of the knives said
cutting knives (11) at the same time each being tapered to form a

wedge-shaped cutting edge.
A cutting machine according to claim 1, 
characterized

in, that the cutting unit comprises two cutting sections
(8, 9, 10) each provided with two sets of knives (13, 14, 26)

having a cutting knife (11) and a lower knife (12), the distance
between said cutting sections being adjustable according

to the width of the pile (1), and the distance between the
sets of knives of each cutting sections being adjustable according

to the length of the pile.
A cutting machine according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized

in, that each cutting knife (11) is mounted on a
knife holder (26), which is secured to a beam (9), which can

be moved, sliding on a die set (14), by the ram press of a
work cylinder.
A cutting machine according to claim 3, 
characterized

in, that each lower knife (12) is mounted on a holder

holder (26) of the cutting knives.
A cutting machine according to claim 1 - 4,
