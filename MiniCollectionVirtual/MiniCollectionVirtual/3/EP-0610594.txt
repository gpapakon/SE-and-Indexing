<ABSTRACT>
CAD/CADM system using a process according to which a command or function together with the parameters relating to this command are selected by pointing directly at an element which has been created by a similar command and has been displayed either in the current work area of the screen, or in another area of the screen, or on a digitiser.

<CLAIMS>
A CAM/CAD system using a method for generating and for processing 
representations of objects in two or three dimensions using a computer 

and for displaying these representations on display means and/or reproducing 
them by manufacturing means, wherein : 


at least one element is constructed, which has various attributes 
which are dependent on the parameters relating to the command which 

had enabled the generation of said element, 
the information relating to the element constructed, such as the type 
of element, its attributes and the relations which link it to other 

elements are saved in a memory, 
 
characterized 


in that the information relating to the command which had enabled the 
generation of said element, as well as the parameters of this command 

are saved in a memory, in such a manner that this element becomes a 
reference element enabling the construction of other similar elements, 
in that the access to a command or to its parameters is obtained by 
visual selection using a pointer device, of an element, of a reference 

element, of a characteristic of an element or of a characteristic 
of a reference element. 
A CAD/CAM system according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
representation, including reference elements amongst which is made the 

selection by the use of a pointer, is displayed on a zone of the 
screen.  

 
A CAM/CAD system according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
representation including the reference elements amongst which is made 

the selection by a pointer is accessed to by means of a digitizer. 
A CAM/CAD system according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
zone on the screen on which is displayed the representation including 

reference elements amongst which is made the selection using a pointer, 
coincides with the working zone on which is located the representation 

being constructed. 
A CAM/CAD system according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the zone of the screen on which is displayed the representation 

including reference elements amongst which is made the selection 
using a pointer, is distinct from the working zone. 
A CAM/CAD system according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the access to the parameters of a command can be 

achieved using a command menu displayed on the screen.
