<ABSTRACT>
Epoxy resin compositions containing a room-temperature-liquid epoxy resin containing on average more than one epoxide group per molecule and a quaternary perhydroaxepinium salt or a quaternary octahydroazocinium salt as advancement catalyst, give, on advancement with compounds containing two phenolic hydroxyl groups, excellent products of low viscosity and good viscosity stability which can be used, for example, for surface protection, preferably as binders for surface coatings (paints, lacquers, varnishes, enamels).
