<ABSTRACT>
A handle (1) for controlling a lock (2) of a vehicle
door (3) has a connecting structure (4) for connection

to the door; a control lever (5) hinged to the
connecting structure (4) and gripped by a user; and a

control device (7,10) for setting only the one lock (2)
to a safety-off mode; the handle (1) having a

respective electric aerial (12), which is carried by
the lever (5), detects an identification code carried

by the user, and is connected to the control device
(7,10) to supply the control device (7,10) with an

enabling signal as the user approaches the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a handle, as defined in the preamble of claim 1, for controlling a vehicle door lock.More specifically, the present invention relates to a handle of the type comprising a connecting structure for connection to a supporting body of the vehicle; a user-gripped movable control member connected to the connecting structure; and a presence detecting device for detecting the presence of the user's hand close to the lever, and emitting a relative presence signal.On known vehicles featuring handles of the above type, the various detecting devices are connected to one control unit common to all the vehicle locks, and which comprises a single detecting aerial, normally located inside the passenger compartment, and a lock-release assembly for setting the locks to a safety-off mode.In actual use, as the user approaches the vehicle, the aerial reads an identification code carried by the user, and supplies a signal to activate the control unit; upon one of the detecting devices on the handles detecting the presence of the user's hand close to the handle, the device sends a respective presence signal to the control unit, which, in response, instantly sets the vehicle locks to safety-off mode; at which point, the user turns the gripped lever to release the lock and open the relative door.Though widely used, known control units of the type described above have the drawback, upon receiving a presence signal from any one of the detecting devices, of releasing the safety devices of all the vehicle locks, thus enabling uncontrolled opening of all the doors on the vehicle. Such an operating mode should be avoided to prevent objects from being stolen from inside the vehicle by thieves who, upon the user being identified by the control unit, are automatically afforded access to the passenger compartment of the vehicle through any of the doors, in particular the rear doors.Documents EP-A-0831194 and document DE-U-29623461 present handles for controlling a lock comprising a connecting structure on which is articulated a movable control member presenting detecting means. These handles are also provided with control means connected to the detection means to set the lock on a safety-off mode upon a consent signal.The document US-A-5 682 135 discloses another handle, which corresponds to the preamble of claim 1.It is the object of the present invention to provide a vehicle door handle designed to solve the above problem in a straightforward manner, and which, at the same time, is cheap and easy to

<CLAIMS>
A handle (1) for controlling a lock (2) of a vehicle door (3), comprising:

■ a connecting structure (4) for connection to a supporting body of the vehicle;
■ a movable control member (5) connected to said connecting structure (4) and activated, in use, by the hand of a user;
■ first control means (7, 10) for setting said lock (2) to a safety-off mode; and
■ detecting means (12) for reading a user identification code and emitting a consent signal;

said first control means (7, 10) being connected to said detecting means (12) to set said lock (2) to said safety-off mode upon a consent signal being received from said detecting means (12) and said first control means (7, 10) comprising a detecting device (7) for detecting the presence of the user's hand between the connecting structure (4) and the movable control member (5), 
characterized by
 also comprising second control means (18, 22) in parallel with said first control means (7, 10), said second control means (18, 22) comprising switch means (18) activated by the movable control member (5) to set said lock to the safety-off mode in the event of fault on the detecting device (7).
A handle as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 at least some of said control means (7, 10; 18, 22) are carried by said connecting structure (4).
A handle as claimed in any one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that
 said first control means (7, 10) comprise emitting means (8) for emitting a light beam.
A handle as claimed in any one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that
 said second control means (18, 22) comprise a mechanical transmission (22) interposed between the movable control member (5) and said switch means (18) to activate said switch means (18).
A handle as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said mechanical transmission (22) comprises at least one lever (23) connected to the connecting structure (4) and rotated about a hinge axis (25) by said movable control member (5).
A handle as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in that
 said mechanical transmission (22) also comprises a control arm (29) connected integrally to said lever (23) so as to rotate about said axis (25) and acting on said switch means (18).
A handle as claimed in any one of claim 4 to 6, 
characterized in that
 said connecting structure (4) comprises a sealed chamber (19) housing at least said switch means (18)
A handle as claimed in any one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that
 said detecting means (12) are at least partly housed in said connecting structure (4) or said movable control member (5).
A handle as claimed in any one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that
 said detecting means (12) comprise an electric aerial housed in a sealed chamber (13) of said movable control member (5).
