<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to diagnosis of gastro-intestinal disorders in
humans, and particularly to measurement of the rate at which the liquid phase of food
being digested in the stomach is emptied into the small intestine and whether such rate
is abnormal.Digestion of all foods in humans begins in the stomach where both liquids and
solids are mixed with gastric juice that is secreted by the walls of the stomach. The
gastric juice is predominately hydrochloric acid, but also includes enzymes that break
down food constituents so that they can be absorbed in the blood and used by the
body. The contents of the stomach are emptied into the small intestine through the
pyloric sphincter which opens and closes to release pulses of the mixture of solids and
liquids. The rate of such emptying is regulated by this sphincter, and takes place more
rapidly in the case of liquids than solids, however both are determined by the calorie
content of the meal. The higher the calorie content, the slower the discharge rate. In
addition, the solid phase of the food must undergo comminution, or reduction in particle
size, caused by contractions of the stomach until a particle size of about 1 mm in
diameter is reached.A disorder can result in either accelerated or delayed emptying. Accelerated
emptying causes the food to be "dumped" into the small intestine prematurely. Delayed
emptying often is encountered in diabetic patents and may be associated with
abdominal pain and cramping. Although medications or drugs have been developed
to increase the rate of gastric emptying, their efficacy still is under investigation.Diagnosis and measurement of gastric emptying has been possible only at
highly specialized nuclear medicine facilities. The testing requires use of one
radioactive tracer for the liquid phase and a second radioactive tracer for the solid
phase. The movement of the radioactive tracers is monitored by positioning the
recumbent patient between two large gamma ray responsive scintillation detectors or 
counters which measure the position and quantity of each isotope from the
patient's anterior and posterior. This procedure requires 3-4 hours or more to
perform.The introduction of a radioactive tracer into the liquid phase of food
poses no particular problem if the tracer is totally soluble, because the tracer
then is miscible with the gastric juice and is emptied from the stomach
coincident with the movement of the liquid phase. The solid phase marker is
made somewhat difficult because it must be attached to

<CLAIMS>
A drink to be consumed by a patient for a gastric emptying test,
comprising: a selected quantity of a fruit juice having a predetermined

caloric value, said juice having suspended therein, by mixing, a distinct
quantity of single celled photosynthetic organisms that have been

grown in an atmosphere that is substantially entirely 
N
CO
2
, said single
celled photosynthetic organisms being suspended in said juice in a

manner such that they are unable to penetrate the gastric mucosa and
thus pass into the small intestine with the liquid phase so that when

oxidized after digestion and absorption in the small intestine of a
patient a detectible rise in the 
N
CO
2
 content of the patient's breath is
produced, N being one of the numbers 13 or 14
The drink of claim 1 where the single celled photosynthetic organisms
are Spirulina platensis alga.
A kit for measuring gastric emptying time of the liquid phase of food
consumed by a patient, comprising a biscuit having a calorie content of

150; a drink to be consumed with said biscuit, which drink comprises a
quantity of 
N
C alga comprising single celled photosynthetic organisms
of several microns in diameter mixed and suspended in a liquid, so that

the single celled photosynthetic organisms are unable to penetrate the
gastric mucosa wherein N is one of the numbers 13 or 14; and a

package of cream cheese; said biscuit, said package of cream cheese
and said drink forming a meal having a caloric value of 340.
