 TITLETape Cartridge Drive Belt Having a Low Ratio of Static to Dynamic FrictionFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention pertains to belt driven tape cartridges and more particularly, to drive belts therefor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn a bidirectional drive tape cartridge of the type shown in U. S. Pat. No. 3,692,255 in which the tape moves at high speeds between two reels and is subjected to high accelerations when the tape direction is reversed, it is important to minimize tape tension variations at the transducer head. Otherwise tape to head contact may be lost and data compromised.U. S. Patents 4,581,189 and 4,466,564 disclose drive belts, typically made of polyurethane, for use in such tape cartridges particularly configured to minimize tape tension variations characterized as flutter. More particularly, the disclosed drive belts are described as having a microscopically rough surface with peak-to-peak roughness ranging in size between 0.2 and 40 micrometers to promote the release of air from between the belt and the tape. This surface roughness, it is believed, is intended to overcome the inherent tendency of polyurethane to exhibit slip-stick motion.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to an improved drive belt for magnetic tape cartridges configured to minimize slip-stick motion between the drive belt and the magnetic tape. In accordance with the invention, this is accomplished by configuring the drive belt surface to achieve a low ratio of static to dynamic coefficient of friction between the belt surface and the magnetic tape, i.e. < 2.In a preferred embodiment, the belt is made of a polyester elastomer material having a smooth surface, e.g. < 4 Î¼", such as Hytrel sold by DuPont. Hytrel is a polyester copolymer comprised of a hard segment of polybutylene terephthalate and a soft segment of polyether glycols.In alternative embodiments, the low ratio of static to dynamic friction can be achieved by coating the belt with a thin layer of a polyester polymer, adding a friction reducing additive or polymer such as a flourocarbon additive, second polymer or copolymer to the belt material or utilizing a macroscopic belt surface.The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention will be best understood from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.-- -
