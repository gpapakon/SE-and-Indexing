<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC CANCELLATION OF D.C. MOTOR NOISEIntroductionThis invention relates to the active electronic cancellation of vibration emitted from operating DC motors, especially motor related tonal vibration. The use of active noise control in DC motors allows for savings in space and weight by replacement of selected conventional noise and vibration absorption materials with active control. Critical ways to eliminate this noise are by cancelling the drive motor slot noise or other motor related tonals such as SCR vibration. DC motors come in various configurations but a typical configuration is a separately excited, DC motor where three phase 60 Hz power from an AC source E such as a diesel motor generator is full wave rectified with six SCR's per drive motor. The phase angle relative to line frequency during which the SCR's turn on is varied to control the speed of the unit be driven. Tonal noise appears at frequencies related to the passage of armature slots within the motors or to harmonics of line frequency if an SCR drive is used. If multiple motors are run at different speeds then slot tones appear, one for each of the motor rates.Noise Cancellation Technologies, Inc. (NCT) has devised controllers which, when coupled to the circuit described herein, can actively control the slot noise. NCT has developed several adaptive active cancellation controllers such as the NCT 2000 & 2010 both commercially available that have been used successfully to cancel periodic noise which arises, typically, from rotating machinery or other repetitive sources. These controllers eliminate noise by adapting the coefficients of cosine and sine components of the frequencies to be cancelled to produce an 180 degree out of phase signal to cancel the tonal noise. This results in very selective cancellation of the tonals related to the actual rate at which the equipment is operating. Adaptation to changes in the noise is very rapid. Also, the need for a reference signal of the actual noise from each source is eliminated and only synchronizing speed signals from the sources are needed. As the cancellation process is adaptive, it is not necessary to know the exact time delay and multipath structure between the device being quieted and the individual sensor elements. The algorithm will adapt to changes in phase and amplitude of the noise signal as long as the rate of change of the signal structure does not occur faster than the algorithm can adapt. An example of the fast adapting algorithm of NCT to variations in the amplitude and
