<ABSTRACT>
A scanner is housed in a similar body to that of a removable printer cartridge, and 
can be inserted in place thereof. The scanner includes a light source mounted on the 

scanner housing which is able to emit light through an aperture in the housing, a CCD 
array mounted on the housing to receive light reflected off the image, a lens positioned 

between the image and the CCD for focusing the reflected light on the CCD, scanner 
electronics coupled to the CCD array for converting the analog output of the CCD to 

image data, and means for selecting between optically scanning media or printing 
thereupon. The scanner electronics transmits the image data to a printer CPU via a 

flexible interconnect which is normally used to select the individual nozzles of the 
removable printer cartridge. The printer CPU can forward the image data to a host 

personal computer for permanent storage in a first mode or store the image data in printer 

memory for contemporaneous reproduction in a second, copy mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical scanners used to convert optical images
into digital data for subsequent reproduction and/or manipulation, and more particularly
to optical scanners used in conjunction with printers.Optical scanners have long been used to capture existing optical images so that
they may be transferred, stored, or manipulated using a more convenient means, typically
a digital computer. The scanner captures the image by illuminating the image with a
light source and sensing reflected light. The presence or absence of reflected light at a
particular point determines the image characteristics at that point. For a black and white
image, the absence of reflected light indicates a black region, while the presence of
reflected light indicates a white region. For gray scale images the intensity of the
reflected light must also be measured to determine the intensity of the image. In the case
of color, separate light sources or filters are sometimes used to detect the presence or
absence of each color component.Although use of scanners has shown significant increase in the recent past, the
commercial acceptance of the individual scanner has been limited by its cost and
consumption of precious office space. Although not as expensive as many other
computer peripherals, e.g., laser printers, the additional cost can be prohibitively
expensive, especially if the device is used only by a single user.In addition to the cost, the consumption of space by a scanner may also be
prohibitive. The computer user already has a computer, a monitor, a printer, and possibly
a fax machine. The computer user, faced with steadily shrinking office space, has been
reluctant to include additional computer peripherals in the confines of the user's
immediate office space, especially if the device is not used frequently. However, this is 
exactly what is required for commercial success of the scanner. Commonly, peripherals
that are not in constant use are relegated to a common office area where the device is
shared by all of the people in the office. The effect of relocating the peripheral away
from the user produces a productivity loss, resulting from walking to and from the device,
proportional to the number of times the user must use the device. Further productivity is
lost when the device is currently in use by another person in the office. Recently,
manufacturers have attempted to address these concerns by combining computer
peripherals into so-called multi-function-peripherals (MFPs) incorporating one or

An apparatus for scanning and printing comprising:

a frame defining a print media path (18);
means for advancing print media along the media path;
a carriage (14) mounted on the frame for traversing the
media path, said carriage (14) including a holder for

releasably mounting at least one ink jet print head
cartridge (17) for printing upon print media transported

adjacently thereto by said means for advancing print media
along the media path;
printer electronics operatively connected to the holder
to provide print signals to the ink jet print head cartridge

(17) when said print head cartridge (17) is mounted in said
holder;
a scanner cartridge (22, 44) including:

   a mechanism to optically scan an image recorded on
print media that is transported along the media path;
the scanner cartridge (22, 44) having a scanner body (44)
adapted to be releasably mounted by said holder;
means readable by the printer electronics for
identifying a cartridge as a scanner cartridge (22); and
means for selecting between either optically scanning
an image recorded on said print media transported along the

media path when the scanner body (44) is mounted in the
holder and the means readable by the printer electronics

identifies the cartridge as a scanner cartridge (22) or

the ink jet print head cartridge (17) is received by the
holder.
