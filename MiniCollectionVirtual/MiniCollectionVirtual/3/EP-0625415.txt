<ABSTRACT>
A batcher plant for producing ready-mixed concrete is 
miniaturized by disposing, side by side on a trestle (16), 

a cement-paste making unit (14) with cement measuring 
means and a stationary cement-paste mixer (14b) and an 

aggregate processing unit (12) with fine and coarse 
aggregate receptacles (12a,12b). Cement paste prepared by 

the cement-paste making unit (14) is admitted from the 
cement-paste mixer (14b) into a mixing drum of a truck 

mixer (M) independently of admission of mixed fine and 
coarse aggregates quantitatively measured by the aggregate 

receptacles, so that the loading of concrete materials on 
the truck mixer (M) can be effectively carried out without 

loss of waiting time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a batcher plant for producing
ready-mixed concrete, which is made compact by rationally
arranging an aggregate processing unit and a cement-paste
making unit, and capable of effectively mixing fine and
coarse aggregate, cement and water.In general, a conventional batcher plant for producing
ready-mixed concrete comprises a batching system 1 in
which a fine aggregate receptacle 2 with fine aggregate
measuring means 2a, a coarse aggregate receptacle 3 with
coarse aggregate measuring means 3a, cement measuring
means 4, and a stationary mixer 5 are vertically disposed
as illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B. The batching system
1 is fixed on a trestle 6. Fine aggregate such as sand
and coarse aggregate such as gravel and crushed stone are
conveyed to the fine and coarse aggregate receptacles 2
and 3 by means of aggregate transport conveyors 7
supported by support columns 7a. To the cement measuring
means 4, cement and water are forcibly fed from a tank
lorry 8 by means of a pump 8a.The predetermined amount of cement quantitatively measured
by the cement measuring means 4 is introduced into the
stationary mixer 5 together with the quantitative water
and the fine and coarse aggregates contained in the
receptacles 2 and 3 which are quantitatively measured by
the respective measuring means 2a and 3a. These raw
materials are kneaded in the mixer 5 to concoct ready-mixed
concrete. The ready-mixed concrete thus obtained is
admitted into the mixing drum Md of a truck mixer M
through a hopper 9.The conventional batcher plant as described above is
massive and stationarily placed in an industrial
establishment or other possible facilities. Furthermore,
this batcher plant has suffered an economic disadvantage 
such that the production capacity to produce ready-mixed
concrete of this conventional batcher plant is rather
small relative to the scale of the overall system.For instance, the conventional batcher plant with a
quantitative mixer having the declared efficiency of
1.75m3/batch comes up to about 11 tons in total weight
and over 20 meters in height. On the other hand, in
general, a truck mixer commonly used generally is 4.5m3
in capacity to transport ready-mixed concrete, which is
about three times as many as the batching capacity of the
conventional batcher plant 8 as noted above. Thus, the
truck mixer must wastefully wait for a long time to fill
the mixing drum thereof with ready-mixed concrete produced
by the batching system.The aggregate transport conveyor for delivering aggregate

<CLAIMS>
A batcher plant for producing ready-mixed concrete,
comprising: a trestle (16), cement measuring means (14a)

associated with said trestle (16) for quantitatively measuring
cement, an aggregate processing unit (12) disposed on said

trestle (16) and including a fine aggregate receptacle (12b)
for containing and quantitatively measuring fine aggregate, a

coarse aggregate receptacle (12b) for containing and
quantitatively measuring coarse aggregate, an aggregate hopper

(12c), and at least one aggregate transport conveyor (17) for
conveying the fine aggregate and coarse aggregate to said fine

and coarse aggregate receptacles (12a, 12b), characterised in
that said cement measuring means (14a) is capable of delivering

measured quantities of cement to a cement-paste making unit (14)
disposed on said trestle adjacent said aggregate processing

unit (12), said cement-paste making unit (14) including a
stationary cement-paste mixer (14b) for making cement-paste

from cement and water and a paste hopper (14c), said cement
measuring means (14a), said stationary cement-paste mixer (14b)

and said paste hopper (14c) being arranged vertically and
said aggregate hopper (12c) and said paste hopper (14c)

having separate outlets for separate delivery into a truck
mixer.
A batcher plant for producing ready-mixed concrete
according to claim 1, wherein said cement measuring means (14a)

is supplied with cement from a cement lorry (18a) and
discharges the cement upon quantitative measurement of the

cement, and said cement-paste mixer (14b) is supplied with
water from a water source (18a) by means of a pump (18c), so

that the cement and water are kneaded to prepare cement-paste
in which cement particles are uniformly dispersed. 
A batcher plant as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2
wherein said separate discharge outlets from said

aggregate hopper (12c) and said paste hopper (14c) are
separated by a distance at least as great as the length of

a truck mixer (M), whereby a first truck mixer may be
positioned beneath the discharge outlet of said aggregate

hopper (12c) to receive a charge of aggregate and then be
repositioned beneath the discharge outlet of said paste

hopper (14c) to receive a charge of cement paste whilst a
second truck mixer is moved into position beneath the

discharge outlet of said aggregate hopper (12c) to receive
a charge of aggregate therefrom.
A batcher plant as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein said cement measuring means (14a), said stationery

cement-paste mixer (14b) and said paste hopper (14c) are
arranged one beneath the other.
