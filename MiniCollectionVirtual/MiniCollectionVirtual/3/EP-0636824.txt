<ABSTRACT>
A valve assembly comprising a valve body (51;81), an obturator 
(2;55;85) rotatably mounted in the body (51;81) and a transducer 

(1;9;62,63;80;92,93;100) connected to or located adjacent the obturator 
(2;55;85) in order to determine the position thereof. 
The transducer may comprise e.g. a potentiometer (9;80; 100) or a Hall 
effect device (1;62,63;92,93).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve assembly. A valve assembly typically has a valve obturator e.g. a disc in a 
butterfly valve, a ball in a ball valve and a tapered plug in a plug valve, 
supported in a valve body. At one position a drive shaft extends through 
the valve body and drivably connects the obturator to a valve actuator. 
Rotation of the shaft by the actuator causes rotation of the obturator 
through a predetermined angle of e.g. 90Â° between open and closed 
positions. In a butterfly valve, the disc may be supported in the valve body 
at diametrically opposed positions. At one position, the drive shaft extends 
through the valve body and drivably connects the disc to the valve actuator, 
whilst at the other position a stub axle, fixed to the valve body, extends into 
a socket on the disc. An example of such a butterfly valve is illustrated and 
described in EP-A-0493921. In order to determine or monitor the position of the obturator it is 
known to provide a sensor with an indicator associated with the actuator. 
However, sometimes, because of wear, damage or other causes the position 
of the obturator is not accurately sensed or indicated. It is the aim of the present invention to provide a valve assembly 
having means of directly monitoring the position of the valve obturator. In accordance with the invention a valve assembly comprises a valve 
body, an obturator rotatably mounted within the body and capable of being 
rotated between open and closed positions, and an electrical transducer 
secured to the valve body and operable on rotation of the obturator, the 
position of said obturator being determined by the effect of said transducer 
on circuitry electrically connected thereto. In one preferred embodiment of the invention the electrical transducer 
comprises a rotary potentiometer and in another, a Hall effect device. The valve may comprise a butterfly valve and the obturator a valve 
disc having a pair of diametrically opposed mounting bosses each of which 
is provided with a blind bore open at the periphery of the disc. An actuator 
may be drivably connected to the drive shaft which is non-rotatably received  
 
by one of the blind bores. Conveniently a stub axle fixed relative to the 
valve body extends into the other of the blind bores and the disc is free to 
rotate on the stub axle. A spindle of the transducer may extend through a 
clearance bore in the stub axle and may be attached to the valve disc at the 
closed end of the blind bore which receives the stub axle by means of a
