<ABSTRACT>
A method of halftoning digitized grey value images divided into pixels, comprising 
successive thresholding of grey values of the pixels and transportation of a quantization 

error made in these conditions for each pixel to at least one neighbouring pixel still to be 
thresholded, by adding the quantization error or part thereof to a grey value of the at 

least one pixel, the method comprising dividing the pixels into groups, group-wise 
thresholding the grey values of the pixels divided into groups, and transportation of the 

quantization error from a pixel of a group to solely pixels of at least one other group. 
Also relates to an image processing device for performing the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of halftoning digitized grey value images divided
into pixels, comprising successive thresholding of grey values of the pixels and
transportation of a quantization error made in these conditions for each pixel to at least
one neighbouring pixel still to be thresholded, by adding the quantization error or part
thereof to a grey value of the at least one pixel.The invention also relates to an image processing device comprising
input means for receiving grey value signals representing pixels,a halftoning unit connected to the input means, for halftoning the grey value signals,output means connected to the halftoning unit, for outputting binary signals,
the halftoning unit being provided with:thresholding means for thresholding grey value signals to be fed thereto to produce
thresholded signals,quantization error determining means for determining an error signal representative of
a difference between a grey value signal to be fed to the thresholding means and
corresponding to a pixel and the thresholded signal corresponding thereto and
produced by the thresholding means, anderror division means for transporting at least a part of the error signal to a grey value
signal still to be fed to the thresholding means and corresponding to at least one
neighbouring pixel.A method of this kind is known from Ulichney, Robert: "Digital Halftoning, MIT
Press, 1987, Chapter 8, under the name of error diffusion. In this a grey value of a pixel is
compared with a given threshold value. If this threshold value is exceeded a logic "one"
or "zero" is generated. By means of this a binary printer, e.g. a black/white printer, can
print the pixel as black or white. The error which occurs when a grey value is reduced to
either black or white is known as the quantization error.Apart from texts and lines, insofar as they do not contain grey tints, a quantization
error of this kind will lead to an unacceptable result in the case of photographs and
screens. However, by dividing the quantization error over and adding it to grey values
which have not yet been thresholded of a number of neighbouring pixels, a grey value
impression perceived by the eye to correspond to the grey value before thresholding will
nevertheless be obtained despite the fact that there are only two values to print. A grey
surface whose grey value is, for example, approximately equal to the threshold value
will as a result be converted to a mixture of approximately as many black as white pixels 
which over a larger area will give
