<ABSTRACT>
A cytotoxic lectin complex having diminished non-specific 
toxicity comprising a cytotoxic lectin covalently bonded 

to a specific ligand comprising a disaccharide or higher 
polysaccharide derivative capable of binding specifically 

to an oligosaccharide-binding site on the lectin and a 
monoclonal antibody covalently bonded to the cytotoxic 

lectin complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a 
cytotoxic lectin complex having diminished non-specific 
toxicity as well as to a novel ligand-support complex or 
probe useful in making such a cytotoxic lectin complex. There are several known cytotoxic lectins such 
as ricin, abrin, modeccin, volkensin and viscumin which 
kill eucaryotic cells very efficiently. These lectins 
are heterodimeric proteins containing two subunits 
linked by a disulfide bond. One subunit, denominated 
the A-chain, exhibits cytotoxic activity by catalytic 
inactivation of ribosomes; while the other, the B-chain, 
contains binding sites specific for galactose-terminated 
oligosaccharides. Since molecules containing 
oligosaccharide components are ubiquitous on cell 
surfaces, the lectins are non-discriminating, hence 
non-specific in their cytotoxicity. This characteristic 
greatly limits their utility for killing selected 
diseased or abnormal cells such as tumor cells. Previously, the lectin has been cleaved into 
its two subunits, and the A chain alone linked to a 
monoclonal antibody to provide a toxin having specific 
activity, but such conjugated products display 
significantly reduced toxicity as compared to the whole 
lectin. It has also been proposed to block the oligosaccharide 
binding sites of a lectin, concanavalin A, by 
treating it with a photoactivatable aryl azido 
derivative of mannose which binds specifically to the 
concanavalin A binding sites, then exposing to 
ultraviolet light to form a covalent bond between the 
concanavalin A and the polysaccharide derivative, as  
 
described by Beppu et. al., J. Biochem. 78, 1013-1019 
(1975). The product retained activity at two of its 
four binding sites and displayed reduced 
haemagglutinating activity. Similar results were 
recorded by Fraser et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 
73, 790-794 (1976) using succinylated concanavalin A, 
and by Thomas, MethodsEnzymol. 46, 362-414 (1977) in an 
analogous procedure. Similarly, Baenziger et al., J. 
Biol. Chem. 257, 4421-4425 (1982) described treating the 
lectins concanavalin A, ricin, and lectin from liver, 
with appropriate photoactivatable derivatives of 
glycopeptides, then exposing to light to form a covalent 
bond between the lectin and the glycopeptide 
derivative. However, only 1-2% incorporation of the 
glycopeptide derivative was achieved in each case. 
There was, apparently, no attempt to determine the 
efficacy of the labelling of the lectins through 
measurements of either cytotoxicity (in the case of 
rici
