<ABSTRACT>
This invention prevents lowering of working 
efficiency and an abnormal deformation, a breakage and 

the like of conductive terminals upon coupling a printed 
circuit base plate to a card edge connector in a card 

edge connector assembly. When a card edge connector (10) 
is inserted into an mouth (4) in a base plate holder (1), 

sliding edge portions (27) ride on ramp faces (5a) on ribs (5) 
to pivot a pair of inner housings (20). Then, contacting 

portions (22a) of first terminals (22) engage with second 
terminals on opposite sides of a printed circuit base 

plate (2). The printed circuit base plate (2) enters smoothly 
between the contacting portions (22a) without causing an 

elastic deformation in the portions (22a) and gouging the 
plate (22) due to their contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a card edge connector 
assembly in which a card edge connector is coupled to 
terminals on a printed circuit base plate. For convenience of explanation, a conventional card 
edge connector assembly will be described below by referring 
to drawings. FIG. 5 is a longitudinal sectional view of a 
conventional card edge connector assembly, illustrating 
a midposition of coupling of the assembly. FIG. 6 is 
a longitudinal sectional view of the conventional card 
edge connector assembly, illustrating a finished position 
of coupling of the assembly. A typical example of a conventional card edge 
connector assembly comprises a card edge connector a 
and a base plate holder g, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. 
A printed circuit base plate d is supported on a base 
plate holder d and is provided on opposite side edges 
with a plurality of exposed terminals. The card edge 
connector a is provided with a slit like inlet c in a 
housing b with conductive terminals e having a plurality 
of resilient contacting portions f which face opposite 
to the terminals not shown on the printed circuit base 
plate when it is inserted into the inlet c. Upon coupling the card edge connector a to the 
printed circuit base plate d of the base plate holder g, 
the printed circuit base plate d is inserted into the inlet 
c in the card edge connector a so that the plate d enters 
into a gap between the opposed contacting portions f of 
the terminal e. At this time, the contacting portions f 
are elastically deformed at their inclined parts by a distal 
end of the base plate d to widen the gap. Consequently, 
the terminals on the printed circuit base plate d are 
electrically connected to the conductive terminals e in  
 
the card edge connector a with the distal end of the 
plate d being clamped by the contacting portions f. Since the printed circuit base plate d deforms 
forcibly the contacting portions f of the conductive 
terminals e against their elastic force in the card edge 
connector a, a large force is required to insert the plate 
d into the connector a. In addition, since a direction 
of elastically deforming the contacting portions f is 
substantially perpendicular to an entering direction of 
the printed circuit base plate d, the contacting portions 
f are abnormally deformed or broken if the plate d is 
forcibly inserted, as well as problems of gouging the 
plate and portions and lowering a working efficiency. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a card edge connector assembly in which

<CLAIMS>
A card edge connector assembly wherein a card 
edge connector having a plurality of first terminals is 

coupled to a base plate holder having a printed circuit base 
plate which is provided at given positions on opposite 

sides with a plurality of second terminals adapted to 
contact with contacting portions of said first terminals, the card edge 

connector comprising: 

at least one inner housing (20) for holding said first 
terminals to direct said contacting portions in a given 

direction; 
an outer housing (11) provided with an inlet (12) adapted to 
detachably receive said printed circuit base plate (2) and 

with an interior adapted to movably support said inner 
housing so that said contacting portions (22a) of said first 

terminals (22) can contact with and be separated from said second 
terminals (3) on said printed circuit base plate when said 

plate is inserted into said inlet; and the assembly further comprising: 
means (5,5a,13,27) for moving said inner housing so that said 
contacting portions of said first terminals in said inner 

housing contact with said second terminals on said printed 
circuit base plate when said card edge connector (10) is coupled 

to said base plate holder (1). 
A card edge connector assembly according to Claim 1, 
wherein a pair of inner housings are movably supported in 

said outer housing to move to and from said opposite sides 
of said printed circuit base plate. 
A card edge connector assembly according to Claim 1 
or 2 wherein said moving means includes ribs (5) having a ramp 

face (5a) provided on upper and lower faces of an interior of 
said base plate holder and apertures (13) formed in upper and 

lower walls of said outer housing and adapted to pass said 
ribs through said apertures so that said ramp faces on said 

ribs inwardly push said inner housing or housings in said 
outer housing when said outer housing is coupled to said 

base plate holder, whereby said contacting portions of said 
first terminals contact with said second terminals on said 

printed circuit base plate.  
 
A card edge connector assembly according to any 
one of the preceding claims, wherein said inner housing 

or housings are pivotably supported at their left and right outer faces in 
said outer housing. 
A card edge connector assembly according to any 
one of the preceding claims, wherein biasing means (18) are 

disposed between said inner housing or housings and said 
outer housing so that said contacting portions of said 

first terminals normally separate from said second terminals on 
said printed circuit base plate.
