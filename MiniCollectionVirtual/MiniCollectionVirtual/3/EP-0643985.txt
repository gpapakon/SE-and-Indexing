<ABSTRACT>
The video game machine of the invention consists of a 
space located in the game cabinet for receiving the video monitor 

where a support plate is located on either side of the space and 
where each support plate includes a pair of tracks. The video 

monitor is provided with lugs extending from the sides of the 
monitors that face the support plates. The lugs engage the 

tracks such that the video monitor is supported and can be 
lowered into the cabinet gradually. A blind mating connector 

connects the video monitor to the logic for controlling the game.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates, generally, to video game
machines and, more particularly, to a device for facilitating the
insertion and extraction of the video monitor into and out of the
video game cabinet.Video games typically consist of a game cabinet
supporting a video monitor and a plurality of player operated
buttons. The video monitor displays a game as directed by the
game program and the player manipulates the buttons to control
play of the game. The player operated buttons preferably consist
of video "buttons" displayed on the monitor for screen touch
control although electro-mechanical switch buttons located on the
cabinet can be used, if desired.While such video game machines are used to play a wide
variety of games, such as games with sporting or fantasy themes,
the use of video game machines for gambling purposes has risen
dramatically in recent years. Such games are commonly found in
casinos and other legalized gambling sites where games such as
poker, blackjack, keno and the like are played. In some video game machines the video display consists of a video monitor arranged with
its screen substantially vertical. In other video game machines the screen is arranged at
approximately a 30 degree angle relative to the horizontal. These, so called, slant top video game
machines are commonly used for gambling applications where the game player sits in front of the
machine and the game cabinet is dimensioned somewhat like a desk.In slant top machines the video monitor is typically lowered into the game cabinet through
the top. Because the typical video monitor weighs approximately 23 kg (50 pounds) and is
cumbersome to handle, it is very difficult for the game operator to insert and remove the monitor
from the cabinet. This poses a significant problem because video monitors are periodically removed
for repair and maintenance purposes.EP546477 discloses a built-in monitor such as an electronic gaming machine, having a
rectangular picture screen disposed in a casing, the screen being turnable in an angle of up to 90Â°,
and a complex arrangement of rails and corresponding rollers is provided to accommodate the
repositioning of the screen.Thus, a video game machine that facilitates the insertion and removal of the video game
monitor is desired.According to the present invention, there is provided a video game machine, comprising:
a) video monitor having an engagement means,b) a game cabinet defining an internal space for receiving said video monitor, the
space having at least one monitor support plate, the

<CLAIMS>
A video game machine, comprising:

a) video monitor (6) having an engagement means (36, 38, 40),
b) a game cabinet (2) defining an internal space for receiving said video monitor (6),
the space having at least one monitor support plate (42), the game cabinet having at

least one track (48),
characterized in that
 the engagement means (36, 38, 40) includes a first engagement means (36, 38)
and a second engagement means (40) extending from said video monitor (6), and the at least one

monitor support plate (42) includes a first and second monitor support plate (42, 44), opposing one
another and located on either side of the monitor (6), each of said first and second monitor support

plates (42, 44) include the at least one track (48), the at least one track 
characterized by
 a first track
(48) and a second track (50) for receiving said first and second engagement means (36, 38, 40), said

first and second tracks (48, 50) being arranged such that said first and second engagement means (36,
38, 40) slide in said first and second tracks (48, 50) respectively as said monitor (6) is inserted into

the space, and such that the video monitor (6) is supported in a first position where the monitor is
removed from the space, a second position where the monitor is fully inserted in said space, and a

third position intermediate said first and second positions.
The video game machine according to claim 1, further including a blind mating
connector (41). 
The video game machine according to claim 1, wherein said first and second
engagement means (36, 38, 40) includes a first lug (38) extending from the monitor for engaging the

first track (48) and a second lug (40) extending from the monitor for engaging said second track (50).
The video game machine according to claim 3, wherein said first track (48) is linear
and extends at an angle to the horizontal.
The video game machine according to claim 3, wherein said second track (50) has a
first curvilinear section (52) including a recess (56) for receiving said second lug (40) and a linear

section (54) wherein the linear section is aligned with said first track (48).
The video game machine according to claim 3, further including a third lug (36) for
engaging said first (48) track.
The video game machine according to claim 1, further comprising portions of said
first and second tracks (48, 50) that engage said first and second engagement means (36, 38, 40) to

support the weight of the video monitor (6).
The video game machine according to claim 1, further including a first set (22,24) and
