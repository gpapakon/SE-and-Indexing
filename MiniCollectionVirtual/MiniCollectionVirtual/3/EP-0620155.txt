<ABSTRACT>
The block (3) has a flat section (5) to receive the nails (6) by means of which the covering boards (1) and bases (2) of the pallet are connected to said block. Projecting from the region of the flat section (5) are webs (25, 26) which end integrally in each case in a transverse plate (31, 33). Further flat sections (7, 8, 9, 10) are thus formed, which only serve to transmit compression forces, but not connection forces between the block (3) and covering boards (1), bases (2) or bottom boards (4). The webs (25, 26) surround openings (22) and cutouts (23, 24) which bring about a weight reduction of the block (3). Since the block (3) is injection moulded, the outer surfaces of the transverse plates (31, 33) can be printed on.
