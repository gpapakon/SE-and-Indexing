Switched-capacitor network having a switching
device (S1, S1' to S16, S16'; Sk1, Sk1' to Sk12, Sk12'),

which switching device charges two first capacitors (C11,
C11', C21, C21') having the same capacitance repeatedly

from a signal voltage source (+E, -E) with opposite
polarities with
 respect to a reference-earth potential
(M) by connecting a respective terminal of the two

first capacitors (C11, C11', C21, C21') to the reference-earth
potential (M) for the charging duration, and

subsequently discharges them via a respective input
circuit of a differential amplifier (OP1, OP2),

which switching device, synchronously therewith, charges
two respective second capacitors (C12, C12', C22, C22')

having a mutually identical capacitance alternately and
temporally in antiphase with one another from a respective

one of two reference voltage sources (V1, V2) with
identical polarities with respect to the reference-earth

potential (M) and subsequently discharges them via a
respective input circuit of the differential amplifier

(OP1, OP2),

two third capacitors (Cr12, Cr12', Cr22, Cr22') having
the same capacitance as the second capacitors (C12, C12',

C22, C22') being charged, by means of the switching
device (S1, S1' to S16, S16'; Sk1, Sk1' to Sk12, Sk12'),

temporally in antiphase with the respectively corresponding
second capacitor (C12, C12'; C22, C22') from the

corresponding reference voltage source (V1, V2) with
identical polarities with respect to the reference-earth

potential (M) and subsequently being discharged via a
respective input circuit of the differential amplifier 

(OP1, OP2).
Switched-capacitor network according to Claim 1,
characterized by two fourth capacitors (Ck121, Ck121',

Ck221, Ck221'), which are charged and discharged, by
means of an additional switching device (Sr12, Sr12',

Sp12, Sp12', Sr22, Sr22', Sp22, Sp22'), respectively
synchronously with one of the two second capacitors (C12,

C12', C22, C22') and are connected between the reference
voltage source (V1, V2) and a further reference voltage

source in order to be charged, the product of the capacitance
of each second capacitor (C12, C12', C22, C22') and

the voltage of the first reference voltage source
(V1, V2) being equal to the product of the capacitance of

each fourth capacitor (Ck121, Ck121', Ck221, Ck221') and
the voltage difference between the two voltage sources

(V1, V2, 2V1, 2V2), and the product of the capacitance of
each second capacitor (C12, C12', C22, C22') and the

contact resistance of the switching device (S1, S1' to
S16, S16'; Sk1, Sk1' to Sk12, Sk12') in the respective

lead path being equal to the product of the capacitance
of each fourth capacitor (Ck121, Ck121', Ck221, Ck221')

and the sum of the internal resistance of the further
reference voltage source 2V1, 2V2 and the contact resistance

of the further switching device (Sr12, Sr12', Sp12,
Sp12', Sr22, Sr22', Sp22, Sp22') in the lead path of each

fourth capacitor (Ck121, Ck121', Ck221, Ck221').
