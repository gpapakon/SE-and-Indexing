<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly for a coaxial cable (10) having an outer 
conductor (11) and an 

inner conductor (12) includes a center conductor. A flaring ring (40) 
and a clamping member (30) 

are disposed adjacent to each other, and the outer conductor (11) 
of the coaxial cable (10) is 

engaged between the back end of the ring (40) and the end of the clamping 
member (30). A 

body member (20) holds the flaring ring (40) and the clamping member 
(30) together with the outer 

conductor (11) of the cable located therebetween. A coupling nut (21), 
secured to the body 

member (20) and disposed around the center conductor, is used to engage 
the connector 

with a mating connector. A conductive insert (41) positioned within 
the body member (20) 

provides electrical contact between the flaring ring (40) and a mating 
connector. The 

connector assembly further includes a dielectric insulator (42), 
disposed between the 

center conductor (15) and the conductive insert (41), for centering 
the center conductor (15) with 

respect to the conductive insert (41) and for electrically isolating 
the center conductor (15) 

from the conductive insert (41). The clamping member (30), the body 
member (20), and the 

coupling nut (21) are fabricated from polymeric materials, and the 
conductive insert (41) is 

fabricated from an electrically conductive material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to connectors for 
coaxial cables, and, more particularly, to a light weight 
connector that is particular suitable for aircraft 
installations or other applications where the cumulative 
weight of numerous coaxial connectors is an important 
consideration. The connector assembly for a coaxial cable with the 
features of the preamble part of claim 1 is known from 
US-A-5 154 636. Such a known connector assembly is mostly 
fabricated from conductive metals such as brass. The 
metallic composition of such connectors tends to make the 
connectors relatively heavy. In applications such as 
aircrafts, satellites, ships or other vehicles, where 
weight is of paramount importance, the heavy weight load 
caused by using a substantial number of connectors can be 
problematic. Moreover, it is relatively expensive to 
fabricate connectors from entirely metallic materials, 
especially in large quantities. Accordingly, there exists 
a need for a coaxial cable connector which overcomes the 
above-noted drawbacks associated with existing 
connectors.  
 It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved coaxial cable connector which weighs 
considerably less than previous connectors, while still 
providing good electrical performance, and which 
connector can be efficiently and economically 
manufactured at a lower cost than previous connectors. In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing 
objections are realised by providing a connector assembly 
for a coaxial cable with the additional features of the 
characterising part of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of said connector assembly are 
realised by the further features of the subclaims.  
 FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a connector embodying the present 
invention; and FIG. 2 is an enlarged longitudinal sectional view of the connector of FIG. 1, 
fully assembled on the end of a coaxial cable. While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative 
forms, a specific embodiment thereof has been shown by way of example in the 
drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that it is 
not intended to limit the invention to the particular form described, but, on the 
contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives 
falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Turning now to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown a connector assembly for a 
coaxial cable 10 having

A connector assembly for a coaxial cable (10) having a 
corrugated outer conductor (11) and an inner conductor 

(12), said connector assembly comprising: 

a flaring ring (40) and a clamping member (30) for 
directly engaging opposite sides of an outwardly flared 

end portion (13) of the outer conductor (11) of the 
coaxial cable (10), said flaring ring (40) being made 

of an electrically conductive material, said clamping
