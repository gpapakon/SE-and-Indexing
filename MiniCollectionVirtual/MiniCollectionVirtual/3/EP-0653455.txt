<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a film to be laminated on 
a metal, and, more specifically, to a film to be 
laminated on a metal, which has excellent adhesion to a 
metal plate and is excellent in a processability into a 
can, such as drawing fabrication, ironing fabrication or 
the like for producing metal cans, when laminated on a 
metal plate and which provides a laminated metal plate 
having excellent impact resistance. Heretofore, coating has generally been applied to 
the inner and outer surfaces of a metal can to prevent 
the surface from corrosion, and thermocurable resins have 
been used for such coating. However, thermocurable resin coatings are generally 
of a solvent type and requires a long time and a heating 
at a temperature of 150 to 250°C to form a coating onto a 
film. A large amount of an organic solvent is scattered 
or evaporated at the time of baking, which exerts adverse 
effects on the environment and causes problems in working 
safety. In addition, cracks and pinholes are easily 
generated at the time of subsequent processing. 
Consequently, solutions to these problems have been 
desired. In recent years, for the purposes of simplifying 
production process, improving hygienic aspect, and 
eliminating pollution, development of processes for 
obtaining rust resistance without using an organic 
solvent has been attempted, one of which is to coat a 
metal can with a thermoplastic resin film. In other 
words, studies are being conducted on the process in 
which a thermoplastic resin film is laminated on a metal 
plate such as tin-plated steel plate, tin-free steel 
plate, aluminum plate or the like, and then is subjected  
 
to drawing fabrication or the like to produce a can. As 
this thermoplastic resin film, a polyolefin film and a 
polyamide film have been tried to use, but they did not 
satisfy all requirements for moldability, heat 
resistance, odor retention and impact resistance. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Sho 56-10451 
and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Hei 1-192546 
disclose that a biaxially oriented polyethylene 
terephthalate film is laminated on a metal plate via an 
adhesive layer of a low-melting polyester and the 
laminated metal plate is used as a can-making material. 
However, although the biaxially oriented polyethylene 
terephthalate film has excellent heat resistance and odor 
retention property, its moldability is insufficient. 
Therefore, blanching (generation of fine cracks) or 
rupture of the film may occur in the course of can-making 
fabrication
