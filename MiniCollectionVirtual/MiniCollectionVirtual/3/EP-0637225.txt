<ABSTRACT>
A circumcision clamp comprises a clamping ring (5) displaceably mounted on a tubular support (9) having a flared end section (12) for internal reception of the glans penis and external envelopment by the prepuce. The clamping ring is movable between an open position defining a prepuce-receiving gap and a closed position in which the gap is closed, and locking means (13, 18) for locking the clamping ring (5) in the closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circumcision clamp. Circumcision involves surgical removal of the foreskin or 
prepuce of the penis. Although it is a minor operation it still too 
often becomes time-consuming and bloody. The common practice, generally, in carrying out circumcision, 
even today, is to use surgical scissors to cut the foreskin. The 
trimming obtain is usually not only crude and rough but also causes 
bleeding and needs sutures to be applied to the cut edges. Generally, 
sterilised gauze and dressing are also applied and sometimes 
antibiotics may have to be prescribed to prevent infection. Also, 
undue or unusual loss of tissue due to simple excessive excision, 
sometimes amounting to accidental amputation of the penis, have been 
mentioned in the literature. In the prior art, there is a number of instruments known for 
performing circumcision operations. For practical purposes, many are 
complex to operate and have an undesirably large number of parts 
which are either detached from each other or need several auxiliary 
instruments in operation. A number of such instruments involve clamping. This is attained 
by tightening a clamp at the desired position on the prepuce by a 
screw mechanism. In such screw devices the screw has to be 
manipulated or turned gradually until occlusion of the prepuce has 
been achieved. This, therefore, does not achieve an "instant 
occlusion" at the site of clamping. Also, soon after the circumcision 
has been performed, the clamp is dismantled and removed. The 
exposed cut edges generally need to be sutured and aseptic dressing 
has to be applied. The wound has to be closely watched for infection, 
bleeding and oozing for the next few days. Some of the prior instruments involve clamping by applying a 
tight ligature to a bell shaped device which is fitted over the glans. 
The foreskin is stretched over this and a ligature is applied at the 
base. The distal foreskin is then excised and the base of the device 
is left in situ until it drops off in a few days. Complications such 
as bleeding, infection and oozing have also been reported. Some circumcision tools involve using a ring-clamp. As the  
 
penis is almost always in a naturally flaccid state because of 
apprehension and fear whenever a circumcision is performed, the ring-clamp 
being used to clamp the foreskin may just fit the flaccid penis. 
A narrow ring-clamp does sometimes pose problems when the penis has 
an erection. Such erections generally occur in the mornings. During 
an erection, as the

<CLAIMS>
A circumcision clamp comprising a clamping ring of annular shape associated with 
a tubular support having an open distal end and a flared proximal end section for 

internal reception of the glans penis and external envelopment by the prepuce, the 
clamping ring and the tubular support being movable relative to each other between 

an open position defining a prepuce-receiving gap and a closed position in which the 
gap is closed, and locking means for locking the clamping ring in the closed position, 

characterised in that the clamp is of lightweight unitary construction and the clamping 
ring is displaceably mounted on and carried by the tubular support and the distal end 

of the tubular support permits voiding of urine and enlargement of the penis, such that 
the clamp may be worn for a few days.  

 
A clamp as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least that part of the inner edge 
of the clamping ring adjacent the flared end of the support is tapered in the direction 

away from the flared end of the support. 
A clamp as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the locking means comprises 

at least one locking arm hingedly connected to the clamping ring at its one end and 
provided with a locking formation at its opposite end for locking engagement with a 

complementary locking formation on said tubular support. 
A clamp as claimed in claim 3, wherein two of said locking arms are 
positioned at diametrically opposed sides of the clamping ring. 
A clamp as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein a stabilising and leveraging 
strut hingedly interconnects the or each locking arm with the tubular support. 
A clamp as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein the locking 
formations are adapted to prevent unlocking after engagement so as to prevent re-use 

of the clamp. 
A clamp as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 6, made in synthetic plastics 
material with the hinged connections provided by zones of reduced material thickness.  

 
A clamp as claimed in claim 7, made by a single-shot injection moulding 
process. 
A method of selecting an appropriate size of circumcision clamp as claimed 
in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein a penis on which a circumcision operation is to be 

performed is first measured and the clamp is then selected in accordance with such 
measurement. 
A method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the measurement is performed 
by means of a device comprising a plate having a plurality of circular holes of 

differing diameters for matching with an inserted penis. 
A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein said holes are arranged in 
two rows of progressively increasing diameter.  

 
A circumcision kit comprising a circumcision clamp as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 8 and a complementary disposable measuring device for determining the 

selection of the appropriate size of circumcision clamp required. 
A kit as claimed in claim 12, wherein the measuring device comprises a plate 
having a plurality of circular holes of differing diameters for matching with an 

inserted penis. 
A kit as claimed in claim 13, wherein said holes are arranged in two rows of 
progressively increasing diameter.
