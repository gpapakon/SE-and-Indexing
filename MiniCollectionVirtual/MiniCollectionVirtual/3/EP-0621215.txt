<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for shifting goods out of a 
goods storing device with the features cited in the preamble of 
claim 1 and a goods drop out device with the features cited in 
the preamble of claim 16. A method and a goods drop out device with these features are 
known from US 3 378 165. According to this method, the goods 
storing device is moved above a dead plate which has a 
staggered, step-like forward edge with step portions according 
to the width of the goods storing portions. Each of said step 
portions is provided with a slide member at the underside 
thereof being slidable forward and back from beneath the dead 
plate to discharge the goods from the goods storing device. The 
slide members are driven by control means including cam means 
with a stack of radial cam discs, each cam disc actuating the 
forward and backward movement of one slide member. The goods 
storing device is slowly moved over the step-like forward edge 
of the guide plate and the slide members are initially moved 
forward according to the movement of the goods storing device 
and are then sequentially retracted to thereby open the goods 
storing portions and release the goods standing in the first 
row one after the other. Unfortunately, this method is very complicated and requires a 
lot of time for shifting goods. Each of the goods in a row has 
to be taken out one after the other. The sequence in which the 
goods are taken out of one row is predetermined by said cam 
means. This sequence can only be changed by replacing the cam 
discs with each other. Thus, this method is not flexible to be 
rapidly adapted to various circumstances, e.g. in a modern 
production line.  
 The object of this invention is to provide a method and a 
device for carrying out that method with which goods can be 
shifted out of a goods storing device in a desired number and 
sequence and which is flexible enough for use under various 
changing requirements. This object is attained by a method with the features cited in 
the characterising portion of claim 1 and by a device with the 
features of the characterising portion of claim 17. With the method and the device according to the invention it is 
possible to take a desired number of goods out of the goods 
storing device at one time and in a desired sequence. With the 
other shutter a great amount of goods can be taken out without 
separately releasing each of the goods by the shutter opening 
the desired number in goods storing portions in a row. The 
desired number of goods
