<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a tool for bar peeling comprising a rotatable cutter head (11) with circumferentially spaced toolholders (15) each of which is provided with a U-shaped recess (17) along one of its side surfaces in which a wedge shaped element (19) is longitudinally displaceable so that an insert (13) carried by said toolholder is subjected to radial adjustment upon a longitudinal displacement of said wedge shaped element (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool holder 
for a bar peeling operation, including a rotary cutter 
head that carries a plurality of tool holders each 
equipped with one or several inserts of cemented 
carbide or similar wear resistant material, each said 
toolholder being secured to said holder shaft by releasable locking means. A device of this kind is known e.g. from the document US-A-4261235. 
Bar peeling is a method by which an elongated bar is 
feeded through a rotary cutter head equipped with a 
plurality of cutting tools distantly provided around 
the periphery of said cutter head for the purpose of 
removing from the bar a thin layer of millscale, 
surface cracks etc. that results from the hot rolling 
of such bars or tubes. In order to achieve the best 
results regarding tolerances and surface finish, two 
different types of inserts are usually combined in the 
same holder. It is desirable being able to make a fine adjustment of 
the exact radial position of such inserts (normally 4). 
Normally we are talking about an adjustment range of 
0,01 mm. This adjustment is usually accomplished by 
grinding the supporting bevel face of the insert after 
the insert has been put into its location in the 
holder. The disadvantage of this method is that by 
grinding the insert also means taking away the surface 
layer that normally has been deposited on the surface 
of the insert, normally by CVD-technique, for the 
purpose of increasing the lifetime of the insert. 
Hence, before starting to use the insert the increased 
performance ability of the insert achieved by said 
layer deposition is taken away by grinding. Further, it 
is almost impossible to make exactly the same amount of  
 
grinding on all the four inserts of such rotary cutter 
head of a bar peeling machine which additionally 
impairs the precision of the tools. In view thereof, it is a purpose of this invention to 
provide a tool holder in which the inserts can be 
maintained in their positions whilst being adjustable 
with other means. It is another purpose of this invention to provide a 
toolholder that is equipped with means that will enable 
radial adjustment with simple means without having to 
provide separate fixtures for said inserts and holders 
during the adjustment. It is a purpose to provide such 
adjustment means that accurate fine adjustments can be 
made without removing the tool holder from its location 
in the bar peeling machine. The invention provides a mechanism for fine adjustment 
of the radial position of

<CLAIMS>
A tool for bar peeling comprising a rotatable cutter 
head (11) equipped with a plurality of holder shafts 

(12) each of which is carrying a toolholder (15) 
equipped with one or several inserts (13) of wear 

resistant material, each said toolholder being secured 
to said holder shaft by releasable locking means (16), 


characterized
 in that a wedge shaped 
element (19) is releasably arranged and longitudinally 

displaceable with one wedge surface (25) in slidable 
engagement with a corresponding surface of the 

toolholder (15) and with an opposite surface slidingly 
engaged with a support surface in the holder shaft 

(12), said wedge element (19) having at one end a 
protrusion (21) that extends substantially 

perpendicularly from said wedge, in which a right and 
left hand threaded screw (23) is received in order to 

actuate the wedge element so that, upon longitudinally 
displacing the the wedge element, the toolholder (15) 

and the insert (13) are subjected to a radial 
adjustment, and in that one edge surface of the 

toolholder (15) is provided with a U-shaped recess 
(17), the depth of which increases from one end surface 

(18) towards the opposite end, said wedge element (19) 
being received in said recess. 
A tool as defined in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the protrusion (21) 
has a smaller width than the wedge element while being 

received in a corresponding recess (26) in the 
toolholder (15). 
A tool as defined in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the U-shaped recess 
(17) extends along the entire length of the toolholder 

(15). 
A tool as defined in any of claims 1-3, 

characterized
 in that wedge-actuating 
screw (23) extends essentially parallel with the 

lower surface (25) of the wedge (19) and that said 
screw is threadingly engaged in the toolholder in a 

position between the insert (13) and the lower surface 
(25) of the wedge element (19). 
A tool as defined in any of claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that the screw (23) is 
threadably received in a threaded bore (29) in the 

toolholder (15) whilst threadably received in a 
threaded bore (22) in the protrusion that extends 

linearly with said threaded bore (29) in the toolholder 
said threaded bores (22, 29) extending in a direction 

parallel with the lower side (25) of the wedge element 
(19).
