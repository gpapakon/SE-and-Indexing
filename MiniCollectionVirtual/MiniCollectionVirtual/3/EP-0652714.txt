<ABSTRACT>
Food products having soft or liquid centers, layers or other areas are formulated by arranging two fat-containing components contiguous with one another. A fat in the first component migrates into the second, forming a mixture having a lower solids content than the second fat, while the structural integrity of the first component is maintained. The process is especially adapted to the formation of soft- and liquid-centered confections. One preferred embodiment employs fats bearing long, saturated C16 to C22 fatty acid residues and a mixture of short C2 to C4 acid residues, preferably containing acetic acid residues, as the migrating fat in a confectionery coating, and hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel oil as the fat in the confectionery center. An especially preferred embodiment employs, as the migrating fat, triglycerides bearing long, saturated substituents containing at least about 75 % stearic acid residues and short residues derived from acetic acid, a mixture of acetic and propionic acid, or a mixture of acetic and butyric acid. Since sucrose and invertase are not essential elements of the center, artificial sweeteners can be used to replace all or part of the sucrose, resulting in reduced calorie confections. Caloric reduction is further enhanced because preferred migrating fats are low in calories.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making soft and
liquid centers in food products such as confections.The manufacture of food products having contrasting textures
is generally achieved by using expensive, specialized
equipment or incorporating additives into food product components.
Dual textured confectionery products, for example,
are commonly prepared by making a shell and then filling
it. Alternatively, invertase can be added to the ingredients
of a candy center to soften it over time, but the
technique involves the use of an additive and sugar is
required as a substrate for the enzyme's activity. It would be desirable to have other methods of softening
portions of food products that do not involve additives or
special equipment.The classical method for making soft- or liquid-centered
food products, notably candies such as chocolate-covered
cherries, employs invertase as an ingredient in a sugar
fondant center (U.S. Pat. No. 1,437,816 to Paine and
Hamilton). During manufacture, the sugar fondant center is
firm and easily enrobed with chocolate or another coating;
on storage, the enzyme slowly hydrolyzes sucrose to invert
sugar. The invert sugar is more soluble than sucrose in the
moisture of the fondant, so it melts under the coating, converting
the firm center into a creamy liquid. The process
requires sucrose as the enzyme substrate, however, and so is
unsuitable for centers containing other sweeteners.Other methods require specialized, mechanically intricate
equipment and/or multistep manufacturing processes involving
shell formation and filling. For example, in U.S.
Pat. No. 3,666,388 to Oberwelland and Klahn, hollow sweet-meats
are made by spinning an open top mold containing a
measured quantity of castable confectionery material and
cooling the body until it forms a shell, which is subsequently
filled. U.S. Pat. No. 4,260,596 to Mackles discloses
an analogous method for preparing a hard outer shell
covering by chilling a molten mannitol composition in a
hemisphere mold until a sufficiently thick wall has been
formed; the shells are then filled.U.S. Pat. No. 3,496,886 to Fohr discloses a process
involving the cooling of a liquid filling to a temperature
below the sugar saturation temperature before casting the 
rapidly cooled filling liquid into molds to form a candy
unit with a hard crust. U.S. Pat. No. 4,517,205 to Aldrich
discloses codeposition of a two-component hard candy wherein
the components have specified sugar contents and specific
gravities. U.S. Pat. No. 4,229,484 to Steels
