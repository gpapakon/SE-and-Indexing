<ABSTRACT>
A container containing or adapted to contain radiation-sensitive media comprises an audible indicator means and a switching means  which triggers the audible indicator means when an operator opens the container. It may be used for light-sensitive, and especially photographic, media in order to warn the operator that the box has been opened or is still open.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTAINER H. AVING AN AUDIBLE WARNING DEVICE AND DEVICES THEREFORField of the Invention This invention relates to a container having an audible warning device and particularly to a container for light-sensitive materials.Background of the InventionA common problem when working with photosensitive media such as photographic or radiographic paper or films or a phosphor material is that if their container is accidentally left open in the dark, the material may become exposed to light and wasted when, accidentally, a light is switched on or a door is opened. Occasionally the container may be opened when the light is on thus fogging the photosensitive contents. Problem to be Solved by the InventionThe problem faced in such circumstances is how to avoid having the container opened or left open in error.Summary of the InventionAccording to the present invention, there is provided a container containing or adapted to contain radiation-sensitive media comprising an audible indicator means and a switching means which triggers the audible indicator means when an operator opens the container..Advantageous Effect of the Invention The alarm will remind the operator that the container is open and needs to be closed. Brief Description of the DrawingsIn the accompanying drawings: 

 Fig 1 is a perspective view of a container according to the present invention,Fig 2 is a cross-section of another container according to the present invention, Fig 3 is a schematic view of a switching and signal generating device which can be used in the present invention, andFig 4 is a schematic diagram of the complete circuitry required for an embodiment of the present invention.Detailed Description of the InventionThe container must, of course, be light-tight when closed. The preferred container has a body and a lid. The alarm may sound when the container is opened or when it has been open for a period of time, or both.The present invention also provides a device comprising an audible indicator means, a switching means which is capable of triggering the audible indicator means and a radiation-sensitive means which is capable of modifying the behaviour of the indicator means.In a preferred embodiment the container comprises thereon or therein radiation sensor means which may modify the behaviour of the audible and/or visible indicator means according to the ambient radiation conditions sensed by said sensor means. Such sensor means may be a radiation-sensitive diode, transistor, resistor or similar electronic component which may, for

CLAIMS:
1. A container containing or adapted to contain radiation-sensitive media comprising an audible indicator means and a switching means which triggers the audible indicator means when an operator opens the container.
2. A container according to claim 1 which comprises a radiation sensor means thereon or therein whose signal is capable of modifying the behaviour of the indicator means according to the ambient radiation conditions sensed by said sensor means when the container is open.
3. A container as claimed in claim 1 or 2 which comprises a body and a lid. 4. A container as claimed in claim 3 in which a part of the switching device is mounted on the lid with another part mounted in the body of the container.
5. A container according to any of claims 1-4 which further comprises a second warning means which can emit radiation of a wavelength or level which does not fog the radiation sensitive media.
6. A container according to any of claims 1-5 in which the audible warning is provided with delay means such that the alarm is activated a predetermined time interval after the lid has been opened.
7. A container according to any of claims 1-6 in which an audible and/or visible alarm is generated upon opening the lid and, after a predetermined time delay, another visible or audible alarm is generated.
8. A container according to any of claims 1-7 in which the audible warning is provided immediately the lid is opened sufficiently far to trigger the switching means. 


 9. A container according any of claims 5-8 in which the second warning means is activated while the lid of the container is open.
10. A container according any of claims 5-9 in which the second warning means emits infrared radiation or radiation of radio frequency.
11. A container according any of claims 5-10 in which the radiation emitted by the second warning means activates a sensor in the darkroom which is capable of preventing the darkroom lights from being switched on.
12. A device comprising an audible indicator means, a switching means which is capable of triggering the audible indicator means and a radiation-sensitive means which is capable of modifying the behaviour of the indicator means.
13. A device according to claim 12 having the characteristics defined in any of claims 5-11.
