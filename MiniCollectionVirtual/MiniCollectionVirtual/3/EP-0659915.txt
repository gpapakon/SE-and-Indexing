<ABSTRACT>
Device for the reed traversing of winding machines, especially warping machines, with a reed carrier (10) which is motively adjustable horizontally and vertically in oscillation and which is adjustable in its longitudinal direction, particularly by an electric motor (11), by means of a drive linkage (12) making it possible to set the traversing extent, and which is coupled to a drive device (13) moving the reed carrier (10) vertically. In order to improve a device having the features mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that, on the one hand, it makes do with only one electric motor (11) for both traversings, but, on the other hand, allows an uncoupling of the two traversings, to the effect that, for example, the vertical traversing can be carried out when the lateral traversing is to be zero, it is designed in such a way that the electric motor (11) causing the horizontal adjustment of the reed carrier (10) also loads the drive device (13) vertically moving the reed carrier (10), and that the drive device (13) vertically moving the reed carrier (10) is coupled to the reed carrier (10) horizontally without any positive and non-positive connection.

Reed traversing device for winding machines,
especially warping machines, comprising a reed carrier (10)

which is displaceable horizontally by motor and is
displaceable in an oscillatory manner vertically, said reed

carrier being displaceable in its lengthwise direction in
particular by an electric motor (11) with a lever system (12)

which permits adjustment of the amount of the traverse and
being coupled to a drive device (13) which moves it

vertically, wherein the electric motor (11) effecting the
horizontal displacement of the reed carrier (10) also powers

the drive device (13) which moves the reed carrier (10)
vertically, 
characterised in that
 the drive device (13) which
moves the reed carrier (10) vertically is coupled to the reed

carrier (10) free from horizontal form-locking and force-locking,
in that the lever system (12) serving for the

lengthwise displacement of the reed carrier (10) has a lever
arm end (14) engaging in a grooved drum (15) driven by the

electric motor (11), and in that the other lever arm end (16)
is rigidly coupled to a crank (17) and is connected in

articulated manner to the reed carrier (10) by means of a
crank member (42) which is displaceable in the direction of

a slot in the crank (17).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 for
the articulated connection of the reed carrier (10) with the

crank (17) a rolling bearing (18) is displaceably mounted with
its outer ring (19) between two cross-ribs (20) of the reed

carrier (10) and with its shaft in the crank slot (21).
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the electric motor (11) drives by means
of a rotary converter (22) at least a pivot lever (23) of the 

drive device (13) which moves the reed carrier (10) to and
fro.
Device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

the pivot lever (23) has one end (24) forming the shaft (25)
of a rolling bearing (26) whose outer ring (27) is rollable

against the underside (28) of the reed carrier (10) in its
lengthwise direction.
Device according to claim 3 or 4
, characterised in
that
 a plurality of pivot levers (23) are fixed equiaxially
to a torsion tube (29) which is put in torsion by a torsion

lever (30) powered by the electric motor (11).
Device according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the
end (31) of the torsion lever (30) remote from the torsion

tube (29) is actuated by a flexible link (32) whose one end
(33) is positionally fixed and which is displaceable by an

eccentric disc (34) of the electric motor (11) from its rest
position against the restoring force of the torsion tube (29).
