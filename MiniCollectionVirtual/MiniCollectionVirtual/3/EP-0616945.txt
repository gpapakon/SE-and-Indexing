<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a method for filling hazardous materials into containers, in which the materials to be filled are portioned and packaged under clean-room conditions at the exit of a production installation via a glove box (1), a lock chamber and a cask container (49), the cask container being positioned under the sealing-off device (3) on the upper glove box on a balance platform (6), and the upper annular flange (50) of the cask container being sealed off as a result of the inflation of the inflatable seal (43), and the passage (2) between the glove box and the room having the cask container being opened, and furthermore the operator drawing the outer bag (51) out of the cask container over the flange in the glove box and fastening it.

Device for filling hazardous materials into
receptacles, having a chamber (1) with a through-grip

opening and a frame (4) arranged beneath the chamber (1) for
receiving a barrel container (49) in which is accommodated a

receptacle to be filled, wherein the chamber (1) has a
closeable opening (2) facing the frame (4), characterised in

that the opening of the chamber (1) is connected to the
frame (4) in a sealing manner via a first sealing device

(3), and that a second sealing device (43) is provided
between the frame(4) and a barrel container (49) received in

the frame (4), so as to connect sealingly the barrel
container (49) with the chamber (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
second sealing device is constructed as an inflatable seal

(43) and is fixed to the flange of the frame (4).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the opening (2) between the chamber (1) and the barrel

container (49) is hermetically sealable with a swing lid
(38) and seal (40).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the barrel container (49) and the

frame (4) are arranged on a weighing platform (6).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the tight connection between the 

chamber (1) and the frame (4) is constructed as a flexible
annular hose (42).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that in the barrel container (49) are

arranged two containers (51, 52), one inserted in the other.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that in the chamber (1) are provided

further devices (12; 40) for sealingly securing receptacles
(51, 52) received in the barrel container (49).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that there is provided a device for

introducing inert gas.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that there is provided a cleaning device

for the chamber (1) which has spray nozzles for liquid or
gaseous cleaning agents and suction or drainage devices as

well as a drying device.
Method for operating the device according to one of the
preceding claims by the following steps:


introducing a barrel container (49) in the frame (4),
sealing the barrel container (49) with respect to the
flange of the frame (4) by activating the sealing device

(43),
releasing the opening (2) between the chamber (1) and
the barrel container (49) by deactivating the seal (40) and

opening the swing lid (38),
fixing the receptacles (51, 52) received in the barrel
container (49) at allocated places (41, 12) in the chamber

(1), so as to achieve a tight connection between the
container (52) and an outlet for the materials to be filled,
closing the receptacle (51, 52) at the end of the
filling process, 
introducing the receptacle (51, 52) into the barrel
container (49), and
closing the barrel container (49) and the opening (2)
between the chamber (1) and the barrel container (49).
Method according to claim 10, which further comprises
the step of evacuating the receptacle (52).
Method according to claim 10 or 11, in which it is
determined by weighing whether the filling process has been

completed.
Method according to one of the claims 10 - 12, in which
the receptacle (51), after sealingly attaching the same to

the outlet for the materials to be filled, is treated with
an inert gas.
Method according to one of the claims 10 - 13, in which
after the chamber (1) has been closed at the end of the

filling process, cleaning of the chamber (1) takes place.
