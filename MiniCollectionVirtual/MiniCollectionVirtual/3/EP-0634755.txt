<ABSTRACT>
A transmission cable (60) for transmitting 
differential logic signals has 

shielding (70). The cable includes a pair of 
insulated signal conductors (62, 64) in side by side 

relation with a wrap (72) of the shielding including a 
layer (82) of electrically conductive material wrapped 

around the two signal conductors. A non-insulated drain 
wire (66) is disposed axially along the outside of the 

wrap (72) of shielding adjacent one of the signal 
conductors (62). The layer (82) of conductive material 

is continued around the outside of the drain wire (66) 
thereby forming an additional wrap (74) of the shielding 

about at least a part of the cable assembly. The drain 
wire (66) is in electrical engagement with the shielding 

layer (82).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical cable
having at least two insulated signal conductors and one
drain wire in contact with a layer of shielding that is
wrapped around the signal conductors along the length of
the cable.Modern signal transmission cables typically are
shielded by a thin conductive foil and include a drain wire
in contact therewith, running the length of the cable, that
is used to terminate the foil shield. Such a transmission
cable is shown at 10 in Figure 1 of the accompanying
drawings. The cable 10 includes a pair of insulated signal
conductors 12 and 14 and a non-insulated drain wire 16 all
of which are arranged side by side as shown. A layer of
conductive shielding material 18 is wrapped around the
three conductor assembly so that it is in electrical
contact with the non-insulated drain wire. This shielding
prevents emissions from the cable as well as providing
isolation from nearby or stray signals, and the planar
structure of the cable provides advantages in routing and
other cable management tasks for certain applications.
When this cable is used in differential logic applications
with relatively fast rise times and high bit rates, the
propagation delay of the signal along the two signal
conductors 12 and 14 becomes important. The air gaps 20,
as seen in Figure 1, result in asymmetrical
capacitive coupling between the shield and the two
signal conductors. The dielectric constant is different for
each one because the air gaps affect the signal on the
conductor 12 more than the signal on the conductor 14,
thereby causing different propagation delays for the two
signals. In fast switching circuitry, high speed
clocklines, and long-run cable configurations this
difference can cause the output signal to either not reach
the threshold value or, if it does, the signal pulse
may be so narrow that it will lack sufficient energy 
to register as a data bit thereby causing a parity error.
A solution to this problem is to arrange the drain wire in
the space 22, against the outer insulation of the two
signal conductors. However, this adds a bulge in the
otherwise flat surface of the cable thereby adversely
affecting installation in many applications. Additionally,
such an arrangement makes it difficult to terminate the
drain wire by automated equipment.Although not concerned with the problem addressed by
the present invention, US-A-3 032 604 describes a shielded
cable in which a ground wire is disposed against the outer
insulation of two signal conductors.US-A-4 800 236 describes a

A shielded electrical cable (60) comprising two
insulated conductors (62,64) and an uninsulated conductor

(66) disposed side-by-side with their axes substantially on
the same centre line (68), said insulated conductors being

layer (70) is also at least partially wrapped (74) about

the uninsulated conductor (66).
