<ABSTRACT>
A wear sleeve is formed from a tube which is expanded radially into a true cylindrical configuration and then machined on its inner and outer surfaces to improve the tube surface finish. The machining operations include machining V-shaped annular grooves at preselected locations along the tube. Wear sleeves are cut-off from the tube on radial planes passing through the grooves so that the grooves form chamfers on the ends of the wear sleeves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to wear 
sleeves for use on circular shafts for engagement 
with annular seals. In particular, the invention 
relates to a wear sleeve for use with an annular 
seal used in association with an anti-friction 
bearing to retain liquid lubricant within the 
bearing. Shaft surfaces are usually left relatively 
rough in order to minimize shaft-machining 
expenses. This presents a sealing problem insofar 
as a rough shaft surface will not seal properly 
against an associated annular elastomeric seal 
surface. Moreover, the machine marks tend to cut 
into the seal surface so as to shorten the seal 
life. To overcome these problems, smoothly-surfaced 
wear sleeves are often press-fit onto the 
shafts to provide a smooth surface in slidable 
engagement with an associated annular shaft seal. Wear sleeves are shown in U.S. Patent 
2,818,283 to Hutterer, U.S. Patent 3,207,521 to 
Dega, and U.S. Patent 3,214,180 to Hudson, et al. 
French Patent 2,593,570 discloses an annular seal-engaging 
wear sleeve for use on a circular shaft 
comprising a cylindrical sleeve having an axis and 
opposite flat ends located in a radial plane normal 
to the axis, one flat end having an internal  
 
annular chamfer to facilitate insertion of the 
sleeve structure on a shaft and an external chamfer 
to facilitate installation of a seal around the 
sleeve structure. In its simplest form, the wear sleeve may 
merely be a cylindrical tube having an axial length 
of about one inch and a radial wall thickness of 
about 1.27mm (.05 inch). The tube inner diameter 
is about equal to or marginally smaller than the 
shaft diameter to permit installation of the tube 
or sleeve onto the shaft by a press-fit operation. Wear sleeves are commonly formed from flat 
sheet material by a stamping and drawing process. 
Initially, annular flat metal disks are stamped 
from a flat sheet. Each disk is then subjected to 
a cold extrusion or drawing process whereby the 
annular disk is reformed into an annular sleeve 
configuration in a known fashion. This conventional process generates a 
considerable amount of scrap material since the 
circular sections that form the holes in the 
annular disks are scrap. Typically, the scrap 
losses are as much as 60% of the raw material used. 
The present invention involves an economical 
process for making wear sleeves wherein scrap 
losses are considerably reduced. Typically, the 
scrap loss is about 5%. The present invention provides a method of forming seal engaging wear sleeves, and

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming seal-engaging wear 
sleeves (13) for use on circular shafts (11), said 

method comprising the steps of: 

expanding a nominally circular tube (70) 
to increase the tube diameter and give the 

tube (70) true circularity; 
machining the inner and outer surfaces of 
the tube (70) to remove surface roughness; and 
cutting the tube (70) on radial planes to 
- thereby subdivide the tube into a plurality of 

individual wear sleeves (13). 
The method of claim 1, wherein the tube 
expansion step is carried out so that the tube 

expansion is about 1%. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the tube 
expansion step is carried out so that the tube (70) 

experiences a permanent set. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the

A method of forming seal-engaging wear 
sleeves (13) for use on circular shafts (11), said 

method comprising the steps of: 

providing a rectangular strip of sheet 
material (43) having a first dimension (45) 

slightly less than the circumference of an 
individual wear sleeve and a second dimension 

(47) several times the axial length of said 
wear sleeve (13), whereby said strip (43) can 

be used to form several wear sleeves (13); 
curling said strip (43) into an elongated 
nominally tubular tube (70) having an axis 

extending parallel to said second dimension 
(47) of said strip (43) with opposite ends of 

said strip (43) slightly overlapped to form an 
axial seam (61); 
separating the overlapped strip ends and 
bringing said ends into abutting engagement 

with each other; 
resistance-welding the abutted ends of 
said tube along said axial seam (61); 
removing weld materials along said axial 
seam (61) to form smooth seam surfaces devoid 

of projections; 
expanding said tube (70) to increase the 

tube diameter and give the tube (70) 
circularity;
