<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a membrane for separating molecules from mixtures, which membrane consists virtually exclusively of molecular sieve crystals, has a thickness of 0.01-10 mm and has a separating top layer with a thickness of 0.01-10  mu m and an effective pore size of less than 1.5 nm, which pore size can be adjusted depending on the molecules to be separated off. The separating membrane can be produced by a method in which: a) pulverulent molecular sieve material and oxides constituting the molecular sieve material, especially zeolite and kaolin and/or silicon dioxide, are mixed, preferably in the presence of water; b) the mixture is shaped; c) the moulding is calcined; d) the calcined moulding is treated with an aqueous solution which promotes crystallisation; and e) the moulding is treated with a solution of the oxides constituting the molecular sieve material, and then rinsed and dried. The separating membrane can consist of one component or be combined with, for example, an alumina support. The membrane can also be rendered catalytically active by treatment with hydrogen ions or with catalytic metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a membrane based on molecular sieve 
material for separating small molecules from mixtures and to a method for 
the production thereof, according to which method a porous support is 
treated with a solution which contains the appropriate metalate ions such 
as aluminate and silicate ions, and optionally alkali metal or alkaline 
earth metal ions. German Patent Application 3,827,049 discloses a membrane which is 
produced by applying a crystallisation-promoting layer to a support, for 
example a metal or ceramic support, and allowing zeolite A to grow thereon 
from a solution which contains silicate, aluminate and sodium. In addition, European Patent Application 135,069 discloses a 
composite membrane which consists of a porous support on which a 
continuous zeolite layer has been applied, which membrane can be obtained 
by depositing a gel which contains zeolite constituents on a porous 
support and allowing the gel to crystallise at elevated temperature. US Patent 5,019,263 discloses a non-composited microporous 
membrane consisting of crystalline molecular sieve material, in particular 
silicon dioxide or zeolite. This membrane is produced by depositing 
crystalline material of the desired composition from a solution onto an 
auxiliary carrier, removing the crystalline material from the auxiliary 
carrier and calcining it. Because of the small thickness (0.1-400 µm) the 
residual membrane is difficult to handle and has little resistance to 
substantial differences in pressure. A method for the production of crystalline zeolite is disclosed 
in US Patent 3,119,660. According to this method amorphous kaolin is 
pressed to give mouldings and the mouldings are treated at elevated 
temperature with an alkaline solution which also contains the zeolite 
constituents; this zeolite is intended for absorption and not for gas 
separation. A separating membrane has now been found which has a pore size 
which can be accurately adjusted so that a sharp separation of components 
from a mixture can be achieved. The membrane has a permeability and 
thickness such that a high separation rate can be achieved and the pressures 
which may be needed for this separation can be withstood. The separating membrane according to the invention is defined in claim 1.  
 The molecular sieve material can be of a common type. Useful 
molecular sieve materials are zeolites, which are composed of silicon 
oxides (silicates), mostly aluminium oxides (aluminates) and often alkali 
metal or alkaline earth metal
