<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for data recovery in 
a disk drive data storage system (12) of the type including at 

least one disk surface (26) and at least one transducer head 
(34) for reading and/or writing data to a respective disk 

surface. A plurality of data recovery procedures (DRP's) are 
stored. When a readback error is detected in a readback data 

signal, a plurality of predetermined transducer head and disk 
parameters are identified. One of the stored plurality of data 

recovery procedures (DRP's) is selected responsive to the 
detected readback error and the identified plurality of 

predetermined transducer head and disk parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for
recovering data when readback error is detected in a direct
access storage device (DASD).Computers often include auxiliary memory storage units
having media on which data can be written and from which data
can be read for later use. Disk drive units incorporating
stacked, commonly rotated rigid magnetic disks are used for
storage of data in magnetic form on the disk surfaces. Data is
recorded in concentric, radially spaced data information tracks
arrayed on the surfaces of the disks. Transducer heads driven
in a path toward and away from the drive axis write data to the
disks and read data from the disks. Various data recovery
procedures (DRP's) are known in the art for use when error is
detected in the readback of data from the disks.For example, a side erase data recovery procedure (DRP) is
disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 4,516,165. The disclosed DRP is
effective against otherwise hard failures due to head
sensitivity to the low frequency content of adjacent tracks, or
from adjacent track misregistration (TMR). In the disclosed
side erase procedure, data from the adjacent track sectors is
read, stored, and then the adjacent track sectors are erased
either on centerline or with the read/write head moved closer
to the track of interest. This allows reading sectors of the 
track of interest that were totally dead using other normal
methods. After a successful read, all data of the track of
interest and the adjacent sectors are rewritten.U.S. Patent No. 4,821,125 discloses a data recovery
procedure including a variable delta-V. Delta-V is the
minimum voltage change per unit time which tests signals to
discriminate between data and noise. Re-reads are conducted
using various incremented values of delta-V in the recovery
sequence.Document EP-A-0447246, reflected by the preambles
of claims 8 and 11, describes a method for recovering
data from a portion of a magnetic surface that contained a
read error. After a read error is encountered a magentic
transducer undergoes a head state change. The head state
change is accomplished by either writing to a reserve area of
the magnetic surface and or reading a portion of the magnetic
surface and then rewriting to that portion of the magnetic
surface. After the magnetic transducer undergoes a head state
change, the portion of the magnetic surface taht contained the
read error is reread.A typical data recovery procedure includes rereads, head
shifts and at least one error correcting code (ECC). Each
