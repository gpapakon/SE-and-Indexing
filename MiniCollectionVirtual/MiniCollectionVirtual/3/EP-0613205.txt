<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to window glass, and in particular window glass for vehicles, within which is incorporated a radio frequency assembly. Beside the antenna (A) which is sometimes incorporated in window glass (V) such as a motor vehicle windscreen, it is proposed also to incorporate a part (E) of the electronics of the set intended to operate with the antenna. Such a measure renders the theft and above all the reuse of the stolen set very difficult. Application, in particular, to motor car windscreens.
