<ABSTRACT>
A device for use in controlling the intravenous drip comprises a cap 
(2) and a dripping vessel (1). The cap (2) is connected with a solution 

bottle (4) of the intravenous drip by means of an upper connecting tube 
(3) while the dripping vessel (1) is in communication with a hypodermic 

needle (5) by means of a lower connecting tube (32). The cap (2) is 
provided thereon with a gas column (23) having therein a gas duct in 

which a press rod (25) is movably disposed. The gas in the upper 
connecting tube (3) and the dripping vessel (1) can be let out rapidly 

by means of the press rod (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical treatment 
aid, and more particularly to a device for use in controlling 
the intravenous drip. As disclosed by Jang in the U. S. Patent Number 
4,959,053, an improved device for use in controlling the 
intravenous drip comprises a cap 2 having a horizontally 
oriented round tubular hole 23 in which a ring 25 is 
movably disposed. The movement of the ring 25 is movably 
disposed. The movement of the ring 25 in the round tubular 
hole 23 facilitates an entry of the air into the 
solution bottle via an air passage 28 so as to maintain 
a constant air pressure in the solution bottle. In order 
to safeguard a patient receiving the intravenous drip and 
to avert any possible mishap that might be brought about 
by a human negligence, the device described above is further 
provided with a dripping vessel 1 having therein a 
valve 4 capable of rising and descending along with the 
level of the solution contained in the dripping vessel 1. 
As a result, whenever the solution is about to be used 
up, the valve 4 descends to a level at which a conical  
 
surface 42 of the valve 4 is caused to obstruct the 
passage of the solution through a connecting tube 3, 
thereby bringing about an automatic interruption of the 
intravenous drip. Such a prior art device as described 
above is defective in design in that the drippong vessel 
1 must be pressed and squeezed with the hands each time 
when the solution bottle of the intravenous drip is replaced, 
so as to force the air remaining in the dripping 
vessel 1 to flow into the new solution bottle. Without 
such a maneuver, the intravenous drip can not be resumed. 
It must be noted here that the job of pressing and 
squeezing the dripping vessel 1 must be done repeatedly 
by a skilled medical personnel. In addition, the prior 
art device for use in controlling the intravenous drip is 
generally devoid of the valve capable of automatically 
interrupting the intravenous drip. Therefore, a petient 
receiving the intravenous drip is often subjected to a 
mishap in which the air is permitted accidentally to 
enter the connecting tube or the body of the patient at 
such time when the solution in the solution bottle is 
exhausted. Moreover, whenever the solution bottle is 
replaced, the solution remaining in the connecting tube 
must be forced back into the solution bottle by shaking  
 
the device; otherwise the hypodermic needle must be 
removed from the patient and then injected hypodermically 
into the patient again. It is therefore
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for use in controlling the intravenous 
drip comprising: 

   a dripping vessel of relatively large size having a 
bottom portion and a top portion, with said bottom portion 

being provided with a solution releasing tube having 
a top end fastened to said bottom portion and having a 

a bottom end coupled with a lower connecting tube, and 
with said top portion being so dimensioned as to fit into 

a cap in an airtight manner; and 
   a cap dimensioned to fit over said top portion of 

said dripping vessel in an airtight manner and provided 
thereon with a solution supplying column, a solution 

filling column and a gas column, said solution supplying 
column having a top end coupled with a lower end of an 

upper connecting tube which has an upper end coupled with 
a needle head which is inserted into a solution bottle, 

said solution filling column having a duct passing 
through said cap and having a top fitted over with a 

covering of a soft material capable of being pierced 
through by an injection needle to facilitate an addition 

of a drug solution to said dripping vessel, said gas 
column having a gas duct passing through said cap and 

having a lateral gas duct communicating with said gas 
 

duct at one end thereof and with said dripping vessel at 
another end thereof, said gas duct having a top portion 

of a dimension for accommodating therein a press rod in 
such a manner that said press rod is capable of moving in 

the direction of the longitudinal axis of said gas duct 
and that ther is a clearance between said press rod and 

an inner wall of said top portion of said gas duct which 
is further provided therein an elastic cushion and a 

plug, with said elastic cushion making contact at one end 
thereof with said press rod and at another end thereof 

with said plug which is lodged fixedly in said gas duct; 
   Wherein said device is characterized in that said 

dripping vessel of said device is positioned at a level 
approximately corresponding to a level of a hypodermic 

needle through which said solution is injected into a 
patient receiving said intravenous drip, and that said 

press rod of said device can be pressed to exert a pressure 
on said elastic cushion to contract so as to prevent 

said elastic cushion from obstructing said lateral 
gas duct, thereby allowing a gas in said upper connecting 

tube and a gas in said dripping vessel to escape therefrom, 
and further that said press rod of said device can 

be relieved of a pressure to allow said elastic cushion 
to regain an original form thereof so as to obstruct said 

lateral gas duct.
