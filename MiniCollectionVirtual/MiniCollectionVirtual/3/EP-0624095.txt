<ABSTRACT>
Blood loss in a patient undergoing surgery, particularly thoracic or abdominal surgery, is reduced by administration of factor XIII. The factor XIII may be administered in combination with aprotinin.

<DESCRIPTION>
Blood loss is a serious complication of open-heart
and other major surgeries. Cardiac surgery patients
account for a significant proportion of transfused donor
blood. Blood transfusion carries risks of disease transmission
and adverse reactions. In addition, donor blood
is expensive, and demand often exceeds supply.Pharmacological and other methods for reducing
blood loss and the resultant need for transfusion have
been described (reviewed by Scott et al., Ann,Thorac,
Surg,50: 843-851, 1990). Prostacyclin and desmopressin
acetate have been tested, but results with
desmopressin acetate have been inconclusive, and neither
of these agents has been able to eliminate the need
for postoperative transfusion.Bovine aprotinin has been reported as being effective
in reducing perioperative blood loss (Royston et al.,
Lancet ii: 1289-1291, 1987; Dietrich et al., Thorac. Cardiovasc,
Surg. 37: 92-98, 1989; Fraedrich et al., Thorac.
Cardiovasc.Surg.37:89-91, 1989), but adverse effects,
including hypotension and flushing (Bohrer et al.,
Anaesthesia45: 853-854, 1990) and allergic reaction
(Dietrich et al., ibid.) have been reported. The use of
aprotinin in patients previously exposed to it is not recommended
(Dietrich et al., ibid.). The use of blood-derived
aprotinin does not eliminate the risk of transmission
of viral diseases. Moreover, aprotinin has not yet
been approved for use in the United States.EP 330 049 describes the prevention of intraventricular
hemorrhage in premature infants by administration
of human factor XIII.There remains a need in the art for reliable and
widely applicable compositions for reducing blood loss
during and after surgery. In particular, there is a need for
non-immunogenic approaches that do not rely on blood-derived
products. There is also a need for compositions
that does not produce the adverse side effects seen
with aprotinin therapy. The present invention fulfills this
need by providing improved compositions and their
application for reducing perioperative blood loss.The present invention provides use of factor XIII
as defined in the claims.The present invention also provides the use of an
effective amount of factor XIII in a biologically compatible
vehicle
as defined in
Claim 2.
Within one embodiment,
the factor XIII is administered to the patient as a bolus
injection. Within
another embodiment, the factor XIII is administered at a
dose of
0.15-0.4 mg per kg. Within another embodiment, aprotinin
is also administered to the patientThese and other aspects of the invention will
become

combination with aprotinin.
Use according to claim 3, wherein aprotinin is administered at a dose of 2 x
