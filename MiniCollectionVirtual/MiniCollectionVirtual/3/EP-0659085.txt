<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF INHIBITING CELL PROLIFERATION USING APOLIPOPROTEIN EBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to the use of Apolipprotein E in a method of inhibiting ceil proliferation.Throughout this specification, various publications are referenced within parentheses. Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this applciation in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention disclosed and claimed herein.In normal tissue, cell growth and DNA synthesis are closely controlled by a variety of regulatory factors operating on both positive and negative levels (Weinberg et al., 1989). As a normal cell develops into a solid tumor, it undergoes several changes (Folkman, 1989; Liotta, 1992). At the physiologic level, growth is stimulated, immunity is decreased, and new blood vessel formation is induced. This capacity to induce new blood vessels, i.e. , angiogenesis and neovasÏƒularization, is characteristic of most malignant cells and is a prerequisite of solid tumor growth (D'Amore, 1988; Folkman, 1976). Moreover, ne blood vessels penetrating the tumor are frequent sites for tumor cell entry into the circulation. Angiogenesis is also necessary for expansion of a metastatic colony (Aznavoorian, 1991) . In addition to malignant cell growth, other diseases are 

also characterized by abnormal neovasculariza ion, including neovascular glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis (Folkman, et al., 1989).Malignant cells produce many factors that stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration and allow new capillary beds to form within the tumor nodule (D'Amore, 1988; Shing, et al., 1985). A variety of agents have been suggested as potential modulators of cell proliferation, including heparin and heparin sulfate (Castellot, et al., 1987; Clowes, 1977) , and growth factors and their inhibitors (Edelman, et al., 1992; Liu, 1990; Schweigerer, et al., 1987) . Most of these factors also appear to be natural components of normal tissue. To date, the most studied growth factor has been basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) , a member of the fibroblast growth factor family (Basilico and Moscatelli, 1992; Schweigerer, et al., 1987; Thomas and Gimenez-Gallego, 1986) . bFGF is a strong heparin-binding molecule, present in virtually all tissues and having multiple
