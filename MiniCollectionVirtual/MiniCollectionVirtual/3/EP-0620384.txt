<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a variable ratio transmission, particularly for laboratory appliances, e.g. stirrers or the like, with a friction-sphere mechanism which can be rotated by a motor and the driven wheel of which is connected rigidly in terms of rotation to the driving member of a toothed sliding-gear mechanism connected in series with it and with sliding gears arranged on the transmission output shaft. To allow simple actuation of the sliding gears without changes in the position of the transmission output shaft, the transmission output shaft (16) is designed to be non-displaceable in the transmission casing (1) and is surrounded by a displaceable carrier sleeve (15) for the sliding gears (13, 14), and the carrier sleeve (15) can be displaced on the transmission output shaft (16) by means of an actuating element (19) arranged in a side wall on the outside of the transmission casing (1), bringing one or the other sliding gear (13, 14) into engagement with the tooth systems (11, 12) of a gearwheel (10) connected to the driven wheel (6) of the friction-sphere mechanism (5).
