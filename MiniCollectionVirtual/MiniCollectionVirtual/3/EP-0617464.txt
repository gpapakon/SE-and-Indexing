A semiconductor device (10) includes a lead frame (12) 
having tie bars (16). In one form of the invention, the tie bars are 

used to support a semiconductor die (20) to alleviate package 
cracking problems caused by stress and to provide a universal 

lead frame which is suitable for use with many different die

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor
devices, and more specifically to semiconductor devices which
utilize X-shaped die supports in semiconductor packages, and
methods for making the same.Package cracking is a common problem in plastic
encapsulated semiconductor devices. The problem arises from a
combination of factors. One factor is an internal delamination
between the plastic encapsulant material and a flag of a lead
frame. The flag is a plate-like member of a conventional lead
frame which supports the die. The flag, like the rest of the lead
frame, is usually made of copper, a copper-alloy, or an iron-nickel
alloy, and therefore has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
which in most instances is different than that of the surrounding
molding compound or plastic. As a result of this CTE mismatch,
stress is created at the plastic-flag interface as the
semiconductor device experiences temperature changes. The
stress, upon reaching a maximum threshold, is relieved through
delamination of the plastic-flag interface. Another factor
involved in package cracking is moisture absorption. After the
plastic-flag interface becomes delaminated, moisture from the
environment diffuses through the molding compound to the
delaminated area. Once moisture accumulates in the package,
rapid temperature increases will cause the moisture to vaporize
and expand, thereby creating an internal pressure pocket in the
delaminated area. To relieve the pressure and associated stress,
the surrounding plastic cracks. The most common occurrence of
package cracking occurs when a user attaches a plastic
semiconductor device to a substrate using a solder reflow 
operation. The rapid increase and high temperatures associated
with solder reflow are often sufficient, depending on the
moisture content of the device, to cause the plastic to crack.There are numerous existing methods of dealing with the
problem of package cracking. One method is dry-packing, which
involves baking plastic encapsulated semiconductor devices
sufficiently to reduce moisture content and packaging the devices
into moisture resistant packets. Device users then attach the
device before a sufficient amount of moisture to cause cracking
can be absorbed into the package through exposure to ambient
conditions. This method is effective, but significantly increases
the costs of semiconductor devices. Moreover, device users must
keep track of how long devices have been exposed to the ambient
conditions to assure that any absorbed moisture is
