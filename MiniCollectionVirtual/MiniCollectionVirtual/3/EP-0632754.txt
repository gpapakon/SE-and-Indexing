<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sintered materials, a method
for their manufacture and to press apparatus for putting the
method into effect.Articles produced by a powder metallurgy route, and having two
distinct layers, either prior to sintering or after sintering
are known. US-A-4 485 147 describes the manufacture of valve
seat inserts for internal combustion engines. The valve seat
inserts are made by providing two powder mixes; one mix being
of a ferrous-based base powder and the second mix being of a
copper-based material for the purpose of infiltration of the
ferrous-based powder. A powder compaction die is first charged
with a layer of the ferrous-based powder and then with a layer
of the copper-based powder; the two layers being simultaneously
compacted to form a green body having a relatively diffuse
interface. The compacted green body is then sintered at a
temperature to cause the copper-based layer to melt and
infiltrate the ferrous-based layer. A significant problem with
this method is that the interface between the two layers prior
to sintering is necessarily diffuse and ill-defined, leading
to poor surface quality in the final sintered product and
necessitating the removal of relatively large quantities of
metal by post-sintering machining operations. Other two-layer articles have also been proposed. EP-A-O
283 464 describes a rocker arm for the actuation of
valves in an internal combustion engine. The rocker arm
comprises a hard wear resistant material layer produced
by powder compaction and sintering and having a body of a
second ferrous-based powder compacted and sintered
thereon. This article is produced by a two-stage process
in that the hard wear resistant material layer is first
made and then placed in a die to allow the body to be
formed thereon. Special measures are employed in the
provision of grooves or indentations in the pre-formed
wear resistant layer to provide for mechanical keying to
the subsequently compacted body.EP-A-O 130 604 describes the manufacture of a two-layer
valve seat insert for an internal combustion engine. The
valve seat insert comprising two layers of different
ferrous-based powders to provide specified physical and
mechanical properties, the powders being individually
compacted one upon the other and then sintered together.WO90/02619 describes a method of manufacturing a hollow
spike-like article by single ended pressing.Heretofore, powder compaction of such composite bodies
has been by pressing on hydraulic presses. Hydraulic

A method for the manufacture of an article by a
powder metallurgy route, the article having at least

two distinct, and separately compacted layers (120,
122; 140, 142, 144, 146, 148) prior to any sintering

operation, the method comprising the steps of
sequentially depositing metal powder into a die

cavity (58), synchronously controlling said powder
deposition and powder compaction means (50, 56, 62)
