<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a spring (1) whose tension can 
be adjusted by means of a tubular body (4) which compresses 

the spring (1) to a greater or lesser extent. The ends (2,3) 
of said spring (1) each terminate in securing means, one end 

(3) of the spring (1) being fixed in a hole (10) in the 
semipedestal (11) whilst the other end (2) is fixed to a 

hole in the basin (9), to the wall or to the means of fixing 
said basin (9) to the wall. The spring (1) is housed inside the 

tubular body (4) provided with an internal ledge (6) that 
acts as a thread onto which the spring (1) is screwed, one 

end (3) of the spring (1) resting against a seat (5) inside the 
tubular body (4), the ends (2,3) of the spring being each provided 

with prolongations in a shape similar to a hook. 
It enables an accurate and symmetrical join. The 
assembly and diassembly are very simple.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
adjustably attaching a washbasin to its semipedestal, by
means of which it is possible to compensate for the differences
and gaps that exist between the juxtaposed parts of
a washbasin and its semipedestal.The currently known means for attaching a semipedestal
to a washbasin are normally fixed to the wall by
means of screws and wall plugs, making accurate assembly
difficult and causing considerable damage to the tiling.Another known system is to join both parts by means
of a closed spring fixed inside a hole made in the basin and
another hole made in the semipedestal, the main drawback of
this system being the opening of some of the springs with a
considerable force when the semipedestal is handled.Document DE-A-3021680 represents the prior art as referred to in the
preamble of claim 1.In this document, it's disclosed a device for adjustably attaching a washbasin to
its semipedestal, comprising a tension spring, the ends of said spring each
terminating in securing means which, in a mounted state, are hidden inside the basin and
at a point on the semipedestal, and adjusting means to adjust the tension of the
spring.In order to solve the drawbacks described, the
device that forms the object of the invention for adjustably
attaching a washbasin to its semipedestal has been devised.The attaching device is characterized
in that the adjusting means consist of a screw-type device adapted to compress the spring to a greater or lesser extent.The spring is a coiled spring which is housed, at least in part, inside a
tubular body provided with at least one internal ledge that
acts as a thread onto which the spring is screwed by means  
of its own coils. One end of the spring rests against a seat
inside the tubular body. The ends of the spring are each
provided with prolongations that protrude from the opposing
ends of the tubular body and terminate in a shape similar to
a hook.In one embodiment of the device one of the ends of
the spring is fastened to a screw for fixing the basin to a
vertical wall whilst the other end is fixed in a hole
provided in the semipedestal.It is also foreseen that one of the ends of the
spring is fastened directly to the wall whilst the other end
is fixed in a hole provided in the semipedestal.In order that the present invention be better
understood, the accompanying drawings show by way of nonlimiting
example one practical embodiment of the attaching
device.In said drawings:Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device with
one of its ends
