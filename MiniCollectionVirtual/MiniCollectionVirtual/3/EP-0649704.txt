<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to 
a method of estimating a load 

applied on a tool of a machine 
tool and managing the life of 

the tool on the basis of the load 
thus estimated. When a predetermined 

amount of processing 
is carried out on a predetermined 

work, a disturbance loading 
torque (Td2) exerted on a motor 

for a main shaft or a motor 
for a feed shaft is estimated by 

means of a disturbance estimating 
observer. When the disturbance 

loading torque (Td2) thus 
estimated becomes equal to or 

greater than a set reference value 
Ts (A2), a timer (te) is reset 

to start clocking (A5) and continue 
the same until the timer (te) 

clocks a predetermined set period 
of time (to). When the estimated 

disturbance loading torque (Td2) 
is equal to or greater than the 

set reference value (Ts), a tool 
change command is issued to suspend 

the processing (A7 to A9). 
Since the life of a tool is determined 

on the basis of a magnitude 
of a load applied on the tool, it is 

managed in an objective and positive 
manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool life 
control method for detecting the expiration of the tool 
life of a machine tool, and more particularly, to a tool 
life control method based on disturbance load 
estimation. As a tool of a machine tool is used for a long 
period of time, wear of the tool progresses to 
deteriorate its cutting capability. It is necessary, 
therefore, to manage the tools in use so that an 
exhausted tool is replaced with a new one. 
Conventionally, the life control is carried out by 
observing the tool itself or condition of the cut 
workpiece to see if the tool is worn out. There is 
known from Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1-183338, 
etc., a method of tool management in which the 
working hours of individual tools are integrated and 
when the integrated working hours of the tool have 
reached a predetermined lifetime, such tool is replaced. It depends on the experience and intuition of the 
person in charge of the tool management to determine the 
timing for tool change according to the tool management 
method in which the wear of the tool is measured by 
visually observing the tool or the tool is monitored by 
observing the condition of the cut workpiece. 
Therefore, this method lacks accuracy and has no 
objective criterion for the tool management. According 
to the aforesaid tool management method in which the 
working hours of each tool is integrated and the tool is  
 
changed when the predetermined lifetime is reached by 
the integrated time, moreover, a tool may be replaced as 
an exhausted one even if actual wear of the tool is so 
small that the tool is not exhausted yet, in some cases. 
On the other hand, even though the actual tool wear is 
so large that the timing for tool change is already 
reached, the tool may fail to be changed since the 
lifetime is not reached by the working time. This 
method, therefore, involves the problems such as the 
deterioration of the machining accuracy and the waste of 
energy and time. Thus, this tool life control based on 
the working time is not an accurate and absolute method 
of life control. The present invention provides a tool life control 
method in which the life of a tool is determined 
objectively and exactly in accordance with the estimated 
magnitude of the load acting on the tool. A life control method for a tool according to the 
present invention comprises the steps of: executing 
predetermined machining on a predetermined workpiece 
using a machine tool; estimating, by a disturbance 
estimating
