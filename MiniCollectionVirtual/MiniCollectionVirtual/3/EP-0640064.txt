<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process and an apparatus for preparing tertiary ethers. According to the process, C4 to C6 isoolefins and possibly heavier olefins contained in the feedstock are reacted with lower aliphatic alcohols, in particular methanol or ethanol, in a catalytic distillation reactor system in order to produce the corresponding ethers. According to the invention, the reaction between the isoolefins and the alcohols is essentially carried out in at least one reactor (5-7) of the kind, which is combined with a distillation column (3) intended for product separation, by conducting at least a part of the liquid flow of the column through the reactor and returning it to a lower tray than the one from which it was taken. At least half of cation exchange resin is placed in the side reactor (5-7). In the process according to the invention, the catalyst can be rapidly changed without stopping the process. In order to improve conversion additional alcohol can be fed to at least one of the side reactors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 
for preparing tertiary ethers. According to such a process C4 to C6 isoolefines and possible heavier isoolefines or 
mixtures of said isoolefines contained in the feedstock are reacted with lower aliphatic 
alcohols. in particular methanol or ethanol, in a catalytic distillation reactor system in 
order to produce the corresponding ethers. The invention also relates to an apparatus in accordance with the preamble of claim 15 
for preparing tertiary ethers. Catalytic (i.e. reactive) distillation is used for preparing, e.g., tert-methyl and tert-ethyl 
butyl ethers (in the following called MTBE and ETBE, respectively) and tert-amyl 
methyl ether and tert-amyl ethyl ether (in the following called TAME and TAEE, 
respectively). In the apparatus, the reaction takes place at the same time as the separation 
of the products from the feed. As far as the reaction kinetics of the system is 
concerned this is highly advantageous, because etherification is an equilibrium reaction 
in which the maximum conversion depends on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the 
reaction system. Thus, when MTBE is being prepared by a conventional fixed bed 
reactor/product separation distillation system, a isobutene conversion in the range from 
about 90 to about 95 % is achieved. whereas reactive distillation will reach conversion 
rates in the range from 98 to 99 %. There are known in the art attempts to improve the conversion of the fixed bed reactor 
process by combining the product separation distillation with a postreactor. Thus, U.S. 
Patent Specification No. 4,503,265 (EC Erd√∂lchemie GmbH) discloses a process for 
preparing MTBE, which comprises withdrawal of a side-stream from the distillation 
column, and circulating the side-stream via a postreactor. The MTBE yield is indicated 
as being in the range from 98 to 99 %. In this case rather large amounts of the catalyst  
 
will have to be used in the fixed bed reactors in order to achieve the desired conversion, 
because the process fails to provide the same advantageous equilibrium as the 
catalytic distillation. Although catalytic distillation for the time being is the most preferred way of preparing 
tertiary ethers, it is still hampered by some problems. In the MTBE/ETBE/TAME/TAEE processes a catalyst comprising sulfonated polystyrene/divinyl-benzene 
based cation resin is used, with particle sizes from about 0.1 to 
1 mm, normally. Due to channeling of the liquid flows this kind of
