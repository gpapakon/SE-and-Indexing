<ABSTRACT>
The gas turbine has a bladed rotor (6) welded together from a plurality of discs (7,8). Hollow spaces (9) exist between the discs (7,8) and axial ducts (17) occur in the rotor periphery between the rotor surface (15) and platforms (16) formed by the rotor blades (13) and segmental heat accumulation plates respectively. According to the invention cooling air is fed to these axial ducts (17) from at least one hollow space between two rotor discs (7,8). For this purpose the at least one hollow space (9) is connected to the said axial ducts (17), preferably by way of connecting apertures (18). It is fed from a central cooling air feed duct (20) emerging from the downstream end of the rotor. The cooling air is preferably drawn off from the process air at the centre part of the compressor, resulting in low-pressure cooling.

generation, having a bladed rotor (6) welded 

together from a plurality of discs (7, 8), hollow 
spaces (9) being present between the discs (7, 8), one 

or more of the hollow spaces (9) being connected to the 
periphery of the rotor via connecting openings (18) and 

the connecting openings (18) mentioned in the at least 
one hollow space (9) starting where the hollow space 

(9) has its maximum radial distance (R1) from the rotor 
centre line (10), characterized
 
in that axial passages (17) are present in the 

periphery of the rotor between the rotor surface (15) 
and platforms (16) formed by the rotor blades (13) and 

segmental heat barrier plates, in that one or more of 
the hollow spaces (9) are in connection with the axial 

passages (17) in the periphery of the rotor by means of 
the connecting openings (18) and in that the at least 

one hollow space (9) between the rotor discs (7, 8) 
becomes continuously narrower towards the connecting 

openings (18) at least beyond a certain radial distance 
(R2) from the rotor centre line (10). 
Gas turbine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a central cooling air supply passage (20) is 

provided along the centre line (10) of the rotor (6). 
Gas turbine according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the central rotor cooling air supply passage 

(20) starts from the end surface (19) of the downstream 
end of the rotor and in that the cooling air is fed 

into it there. 
Gas turbine according to Claim 3 and having an 
exhaust gas diffuser (4) which has an inner ring (24) 

accommodating the downstream end of the rotor, an outer 
ring (23) and hollow ribs (22) connecting inner ring 

and outer ring together, characterized in that the 
cooling air is guided in at least one cooling air 

conduit (21) through at least one of the hollow ribs 
(22) to the downstream end of the rotor.  

 
Gas turbine according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the cooling air is tapped at the 

central part of the compressor (1). 
Gas turbine according to one of Claims 1 to 4 
and in which the individual rotor discs (7, 8) are 

respectively welded together at their edge zones by 
means of a weld seam (12) extending as an annulus, 

characterized in that each weld seam (12) is arranged 
offset axially relative to the connecting openings (18) 

mentioned. 
Gas turbine according to Claims 1 and 6, 
characterized in that the radial distance (R1) from the 

rotor centre line (10), from which the connecting 
openings (10) [sic]
 start is larger than the radial
