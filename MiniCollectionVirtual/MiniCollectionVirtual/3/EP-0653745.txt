<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helical scanning
system for use in a video cassette recorder ("VCR"); and, more
particularly, to a multi-track scanning system of a magnetic
tape loaded in the VCR.In a VCR, a helical scanning system is normally employed
to scan a magnetic tape through the use of a cylindrical
rotatable drum assembly called "scanner" having a pair of
video heads installed in a diametrically opposite relationship
thereon for recording and/or reproducing a video signal.Each video head is in contact with the tape for each
revolution of the drum assembly to record or reproduce on a
per field basis.In such a helical scanning system, it is sometimes
necessary to reproduce or record video signals at a high speed
for the purpose of fast duplication. One of the important
variables that control the duplication speed is the tape
movement speed. The faster the tape movement speed is, the
higher the duplication speed becomes. However, as the tape
movement speed increases, the trajectory of the video heads 
tends to be misaligned with respect to their corresponding
tracks on the tape due to the change in the relative speed
between the tape and the video heads in contact with the tape.
Therefore, there may occur cross talks caused by one of the
video heads scanning a portion of its adjacent track. The
cross talks in turn may produce a noise band in a reproduced
picture.Another important variable is the number of the heads
mounted on the drum assembly. Certain VCR models include an
extra pair of video heads. For example, one of the multi-head
VCR system disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 5,311,375 issued to
Yoshiyuki Ikushima et al. includes a head arrangement on a
drum assembly having a first and a second pairs of heads. The
first pair of heads scans to form a first and a second tracks
spaced apart by approximately one track width, and the second
pair of heads scans to form a third and a fourth tracks spaced
apart by approximately one track width and in an interlaced
manner with the first and the second tracks. Such head
arrangement may be useful in improving the quality of a
reproduced picture in a special reproducing mode such as a
still, fast forward, or cue mode.Accordingly, there exists a need to develop a technology
capable of equipping a VCR with the ability to duplicate
prerecorded video signals in a high speed without creating a
noise band. The abstract of the JP-A-04 195 789 which is considered to represent the closest prior art discloses a rotatable
drum assembly, on which at least two groups
