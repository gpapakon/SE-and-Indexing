<ABSTRACT>
A device for accurately monitoring a collapsed portion when an underground excavator advances. Three or more combinations 
different from one another of a pair of conductive electrodes and a pair of detecting electrodes out of electrodes (1-8) are 

successively selected, and, for every combination, an electric power (17) and a voltmeter (16) are successively and switchingly connected. 
A specific resistance of a collapsed portion (24) is calculated for every combination on the basis of a detected voltage for 

each selected combination. A specific resistance for every combination as calculated above and the distance between selected conductive 
electrodes for every combination are successively substituted into an operational expression showing the interrelations between 

the calculated value of a specific resistance, the distance between selected conductive electrodes, a real specific resistance 
of the collapsed portion (24) in muddy water, a real specific resistance in the natural ground (22) of the collapsed portion (24) 

and the depth of muddy water, so that three or more expressions can be obtained. The depth of muddy water is calculated on the 
basis of these three or more expressions. As described above, the value of a real specific resistance is not a known one, but regarded 

as an unknown one, whereby the depth of muddy water is calculated. Therefore, even if the real specific resistance of the 
collapsed portion (24) is changed with the progress of excavation, the change can be accommodated and the depth of muddy water 

can be constantly and accurately calculated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
monitoring on a real time basis how the natural ground is 
collapsed as such an underground excavator as a shield type 
excavator advances in the natural ground. With a so-called shield type excavator, since the 
excavator is covered on its outer side with a skin plate 
made of metal, it is impossible from its inside to visually 
observe the collapsing state of the natural ground during 
advancement of the excavator through the natural ground. 
For the purpose of allowing detection of the collapse of 
the natural ground, there is usually provided on the 
surface of the skin plate such a device as to measure a 
distance between a shielding main body and the natural 
ground. One of such types of collapse monitoring devices 
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
Publication No. 62-178689. Disclosed in this publication is such a technique 
for monitoring a collapse based on a specific resistance 
detection system of a so-called Wenner arrangement or array 
that a row of eight electrodes are arranged on an electrode  
 
plate provided on the surface of an underground excavator, 
a first voltmeter is connected across a pair of detection 
electrodes disposed at a center among the eight electrodes, 
a power source is connected to a pair of power-supply 
electrodes disposed outside the pair of detection 
electrodes, a second voltmeter is connected across a pair 
of detection electrodes disposed outside the pair of power-supply 
electrodes, and a power source is connected across a 
pair of power-supply electrodes disposed outside the pair 
of detection electrodes. And the inner first voltmeter and 
the outer second voltmeter are suitably changed over 
depending on a collapse state to find a specific resistance 
of the collapsed portion on the basis of the detected 
voltage to thereby calculate a depth of muddy water between 
the excavator and the natural ground. In this case, there is satisfied a predetermined 
operational expression showing a predetermined relationship 
among the calculated specific resistance, the distance 
between the selected power-supply electrodes, a real 
specific resistance of the muddy water part of the 
collapsed portion, a specific resistance of natural ground 
of the collapsed portion, and the depth of the muddy water. 
When a calculated specific resistance value obtained based 
on an output of the voltmeter is substituted in the 
operational expression with use of the real specific 
resistance as a known value to
