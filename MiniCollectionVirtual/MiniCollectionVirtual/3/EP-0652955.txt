<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA sequences, that
contain the coding region of amino acid transporters,
whose introduction in a plant genome modifies the transfer
of metabolites in transgenic plants, plasmids, bacteria,
yeasts and plants containing these DNA sequences, as well
as their use.For many plant species it is known, that the delivery of
energy rich compounds to the phloem through the cell wall
takes place throughout the cell. Transporter molecules,
which allow the penetration of amino acids through the
plant cell wall are not known.In bacteria, numerous amino acid transport systems have
been characterised. For aromatic amino acids, 5 different
transporters have been described, which can transport one
of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, whilst the
others are specific for individual amino acids. (see
Sarsero et al., 1991, J Bacteriol 173: 3231-3234). The
speed constants of the transport process indicates that
the specific transport is less efficient. For several
transporter proteins, the corresponding genes have been
cloned. This has been achieved using transport deficient
mutants, which were selected for their transport ability
after transformation with DNA fragments as inserts in
expression vectors. (see Wallace et al., 1990, J Bacteriol
172: 3214-3220). The mutants were selected depending on
their ability to grow in the presence of toxic analogues 
of amino acids, since they cannot take up these and
therefore cannot be impaired.Corresponding complementation studies have been carried
out with the eukaryotic yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Tanaka & Fink (1985, Gene 38: 205-214) describe a
histidine transporter that was identified by
complementation of a mutation. Vandenbol et al. (1989,
Gene 83: 153-159) describe a proline transporter for
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast possesses two
different permeases for proline. One transports with lower
efficiency and can be used also for other amino acids, and
the other is proline-specific and works with high
affinity. The latter was coded from the put4 gene. This
carries an open reading frame for a peptide with a
molecular weight of 69 kDa. The protein contains 12
membrane-penetrating regions, but does not contain any N-terminal
signal sequence for secretion. This is a typical
property of integral membrane proteins. The permeases
possess homology for arginine and for histidine permease
from yeast, but not however for proline permease from
Escherichia coli.For plant cells, by studies on tobacco suspension
cultures, it has been found that the
