<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a carbonic diester by the catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide with a nitrous ester in the presence 
of a solid catalyst, characterized by adding a minute amount of a chloroformic ester to the feedstock gas comprising carbon monoxide 

and a nitrous ester, whereby the catalyst can be kept in a highly activated state for long and can provide the objective diester 
at a high reaction velocity and a high selectivity stably for long.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a carbonic acid diester, for example, a 
carbonic acid dialkylester, from carbon monoxide and a 
nitrous acid ester. Particularly, the present invention 
relates to a process for selectively producing a carbonic 
acid diester at a high stability over a long time at a 
high reaction rate by mixing a chloroformic acid ester 
into a starting material gas containing carbon monoxide 
and nitrous acid ester, and subjecting the mixed material 
gas to a catalytic reaction in the presence of a solid 
catalyst. The carbonic acid diesters are industrially very 
useful as intermediates of polymers such as 
polycarbonates and polyurethane as synthesis materials of 
various chemical reagents, and as solvents. A conventional method of producing a carbonic acid 
diester by a reaction of phosgene with an alcohol is a 
well known and very old method that has been practiced 
for some time. Nevertheless, this conventional method is 
disadvantageous in that phosgene has an extremely strong 
toxicity, and thus is not preferable as a starting 
material in view of environmental and health 
considerations. Also, since the reaction of the 
conventional method produces hydrochloric acid as a by-product, 
which corrodes the reaction device, an expensive 
material must be selected and employed for the reaction 
apparatus. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a new method 
of producing a carbonic acid diester without using 
phosgene, in consideration of the environmental and  
 
health and industrial difficulty. In response to this demand, various attempts have 
been made to produce a carbonic acid diester from an 
alcohol and carbon monoxide, as disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 60-75,447, and 63-72,650, and Japanese Examined 
Patent Publication (Kokoku) 63-38,018. In those methods, the carbonic acid diester is 
produced by a catalytic oxygen-oxidizing reaction of 
carbon monoxide with an alcohol in a liquid phase, in the 
presence of a catalyst consisting of a copper halide or 
palladium halide. These methods are disadvantageous in 
that, in the catalytic oxygen-oxidizing reaction, carbon 
dioxide is produced as a by-product, and thus the 
production of the carbonic acid diester is effected with 
a low selectivity based on the amount of carbon monoxide 
supplied to the reaction system, and the catalytic 
oxygen-oxidizing reaction produces water as another by-product, 
and thus the isolation of the resultant carbonic 
acid
