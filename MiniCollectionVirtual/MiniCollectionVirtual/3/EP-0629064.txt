<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates, in particular, to transmission of speech information and of data in a structure formed by communication nodes, between which channels make it possible to establish communication by cables or by radio channel. The calling node (N1) requests, from a central management unit (G), an identification number (TI) of the communication to be established; then each of the two nodes communicates by attaching this number to all sending of information and by using, for preference, (3), a channel which it already has available for another communication between the two nodes in question; if this is impossible, it requests (3a) the allocation of a free channel by the management unit (G). When, in the course of communication, a channel is no longer used, the node to which it was allocated can return it to the management unit. Application in time-division, multiple-access structures.
