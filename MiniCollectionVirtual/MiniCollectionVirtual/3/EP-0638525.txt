with a refining bank (11) which extends upwards from the tank
bottom, and a homogenising part (13); and

f: a flow from the melt part (16a) in the direction of the delivery
end (6) and an opposing ground flow are established by

generating a temperature gradient in the glass melt by 
delivery of heating energy to the glass bath surface by means

of burners (22) configured in the furnace chamber (21);

   
characterised in that
g: the ratio of length "L"" of the horizontal component of the
second flow path of the glass melt in the furnace chamber

components of the first and the second flow path o
f the glass
melt are selected at least at 0.5;
h: the heating energy of the glass melt is predominently
delivered in the melt part (16a);

top through the waste gas and from the bottom exclusively by

the glass melt flow which is ducted up to the delivery end (6).

characterised in that
 the ratio L2
: (L1 + L2) is selected at least at 0.53.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

300 cm ahead of the refining bank (11) as seen in the flow
direction by gas blowing from at least one bubbler series (28, 29)

which is configured vertically to the longitudinal axis of the melt
tank (2).
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the energy
input into the melt in the area of the bubblers (28, 29) is

increased by at least two oppositely positioned burners (22)
which are configured above the at least one bubbler series (28,

29) and which have a higher output than the other burners.
Tank furnace for melting glass with a melt tank (2) with a tank
basin (3) with tank bottom (9) and a superstructure (4) with an

arch (5), which

(6) for glass raw material arranged near a first end wall (17)

and a second end wall (20) one behind the other a
pre-heating part (16), a melt part (16a), a refining part (12) 

with a refining bank (11) which extends upward from the tank
bottom and a homogenising part (13); and
b: in the furnace inside chamber between the first end wall (17)
at the delivery end (6) and the melt part (16a) is configured at

least one separating wall (18, 19), which extends downward
