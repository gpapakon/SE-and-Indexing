<ABSTRACT>
Milling tool including a hollowed-out cylindrical body (1), the end of which has the shape of a rounded and off-centered cone (2) through which there passes an oblique orifice of oblong cross-section extending over the complete height of the wall of the cone. The configuration of this orifice, one of the sides of which forms the cutting edge (8), makes it possible, when using this milling tool to drill holes in pipes, to form a single chip which remains trapped in the internal hollowing of the milling tool, provided it is given an even vertical movement. This milling tool is particularly useful when installing bypass connections on a main pipe through which a fluid is flowing, without interrupting the service.

Milling cutting tool consisting of a cylindrical 
body (1) which includes a central recess, the end of the 

cylindrical body (1) being prolonged by a cone (2), the 
axis (6) of which is parallel to the axis (5) of the 

cylindrical body (1) but off-centre with respect to the 
latter, characterized in that the outside of the cone (2) 

communicates with the central recess of the cylindrical 
body (1) via an orifice of oblong cross-section extending 

at least over the entire height of the wall of the cone; 
and the generatrix (13) of this orifice contained in the 

plane P passes through the geometrical apex (22) of the 
cone (2), so as to form a substantially straight cutting 

edge (8) extending at least from the apex of the cone to 
the periphery (10) of the cylindrical body of the milling 

cutting tool. 
Milling cutting tool according to Claim 1, in 
which the axis (4) of the orifice of oblong cross-section 

is contained in a plane parallel to the plane P containing 
the axes (5) and (6) without being parallel to them. 
Milling cutting tool according to one of Claims 
1 and 2, in which the end of the cone (2) is rounded in 

such a way that its rounded apex (7) lies on the axis (5) 
of the cylindrical body. 
Milling cutting tool according to Claim 3, in 
which the generatrix (13) of the orifice of oblong 

cross-section contained in the plane P passes through the 
rounded apex (7) of the cone (2). 
Milling cutting tool according to one of the 
preceding claims, in the wall of the cylindrical body (1) 

of which a window (3) is drilled, the lower edge of which  
 

is located at a distance from the upper edge of the 
orifice of oblong cross-section at least equal to the 

maximum thickness of the walls to be drilled. 
Milling cutting tool according to one of the 
preceding claims, in which a length of the wall of the 

cylindrical body extending, in the direction parallel to 
its axis (5), from the line of intersection of the cone 

(2) with the cylindrical body (1), includes a clearance 
(12) of depth progressively decreasing in the direction 

of rotation of the milling cutting tool, starting at a 
place located between the cutting edge (8) and the 

generatrix (9) of the cylindrical body (1) closest to the 
axis (6) of the cone. 
Milling cutting tool according to Claim 6, in 
which the clearance (12) has a height, measured parallel 

to the axis (5) of the cylindrical body, at least equal 
to the thickness of the wall to be drilled. 
Tool according to one of the preceding claims, in 
which the orifice of oblong cross-section is produced by 

grinding.
