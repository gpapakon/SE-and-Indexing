<ABSTRACT>
A modular wall proximity reclining/tilt chair and method for assembling it are disclosed. The modular wall proximity reclining/tilt chair (10) includes a simplified actuation mechanism (12) which significantly reduces system complexity and weight while providing improved comfort to the seat occupant. The construction is such that the pre-assembled actuation mechanism (12) is integrally suspended from and interdependent with box-like modular frame components (24, 26, 28). In this manner, the frame components (24, 26, 28) can be upholstered prior to final assembly with the actuation mechanism (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to reclining chairs and, more
particularly, to a method for assembling an improved "wall proximity" reclining chair
from pre-assembled modular components.Traditionally, reclining chairs are equipped with an actuation
mechanism which is operatively interconnected between a prefabricated chair frame
and a stationary base assembly. The actuation mechanism is typically a combination
of various mechanical linkages operable for providing various comfort features such
as independent reclining movement of a seat assembly as well as actuation of an
extensible leg rest assembly and associated tilting of the chair frame. In "wall
proximity" reclining chairs, the actuation mechanism must also be operable to
maintain a generally constant clearance between the reclinable seat assembly and an
adjacent stationary structure (i.e., wall surface, table, etc.) during the entire range of
reclining movement. Generally, the actuation mechanism includes a track
arrangement for causing longitudinal movement of the entire chair frame relative to
the stationary base assembly during "wall proximity" reclining movement to
accommodate for rearward angular movement of the seat back relative to the chair
frame.Due to the relative complexity of conventional actuation mechanisms,
it is common practice in the furniture industry to assemble the various mechanical
linkages into a "stand-alone" mechanism frame assembly. A prefabricated U-shaped
chair frame is frequently bolted around the mechanism frame with the open portion
of the "U" corresponding to the front of the chair. Accordingly, such reclining chairs 
having a mechanism frame assembly located within a prefabricated chair frame are
commonly referred to as having a "frame within a frame" construction. As such,
most furniture manufacturers do not upholster the exterior surfaces of the
prefabricated chair frame until after the mechanism frame assembly has been
installed. Unfortunately, the upholstering operation is very inefficient and expensive
in that the frequently heavy and cumbersome prefabricated chair frame must be
manually manipulated in an extremely labor-intensive manner.Another disadvantage associated with reclining chairs equipped with
conventional actuation mechanisms is that a relatively large amount of frictional drag
is typically generated between the upholstered components which must be overcome
for smooth movement of the seat assembly between the "upright" and "reclined"
positions. As such, lighter weight seat occupants must
