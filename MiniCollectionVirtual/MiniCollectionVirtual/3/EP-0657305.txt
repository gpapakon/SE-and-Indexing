and the rear face of the longitudinal joining ends of the main body (2), 

whereby the upper member (8) of the manipulation member (6) is brought into

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a paper holder having 
a locking device for preventing clipping fingers from 
incidental opening. In a paper holder, arcuate clipping fingers that 
conduct closing movement to form a semi-circular shape are 
opened, typically, by turning a manipulation member disposed 
to a longitudinal end of the paper holder or by the 
action of inverting the warp of a main body on which the 
clipping fingers are planted. Anyway, the clipping fingers 
can be closed or opened by applying a closing/opening 
operation as required. Generally, a paper holder basically has such a constitution 
as capable of retaining each of the states of 
the clipping fingers, namely, an open state and a closed 
state once attained by an operation given to them till a 
next operation is applied in the opposite way. Compression stresses exert on the main body having  
 
the clipping fingers planted thereon when both sides of 
the main body are seized between a back plate, and this 
produces warping force of deforming them into arcuate 
cross sectional shapes. This results in bistable forms 
opposite to each other, that is, either an convex or 
concave shape. In most of paper holders in the prior art 
as, for example, in that described in US-A-5 135 323 or in 
DE-A-2 362 356, 
when it is 
intended to close the clipping fingers into a semi-circular 
shape, paired clipping fingers are closed to join the top 
ends of them by externally urging the outer circumferential 
ends of them. However, even when the clipping fingers are once put 
into the closed state, they are sometimes caused to open 
spontaneously by external pressure, impact shock or the 
like, thereby detaching engaged sheets of paper out of the 
clipping fingers to trouble a user. This incidental or 
unwilling opening of the clipping fingers are often caused 
in the course of marketing communication before goods are 
handed to end users. As an example, such troubles occur most frequently 
at the inside of a packaging case containing a plurality 
of paper holders, in particular, during transportation of 
them with the page-opening side of the paper holders being 
turned downward. The size of sheets of paper engaged in a paper holder  
 
is generally smaller than that of a paper holder cover and 
all the weight of the engaged sheets of paper are supported 
only by the holder cover on both outer sides when the paper 
holder turned downward. If packaged paper holders are fallen even from a slight 
height, weight of the engaged sheets of paper is exerted

<CLAIMS>
A paper holder having a locking device for preventing 
clipping fingers from incidental opening comprising: 


a back plate (1) made of a resilient material, 
a pair of main bodies (2) having longitudinal inner sides 
joining rotatably to each other and longitudinal outer 

sides embracing both of longitudinal outer sides of said 
back plate (1) and rotatable at the embraced outer sides as 

pivotal portions, 
a plurality pairs of arcuate clipping fingers (3) planted 
in a row at the upper surface of the said main bodies (2) 

along the longitudinal direction thereof, in which the top 
ends of each pair of the clipping fingers are capable of 

engaging or disengaging with each other by the vertical 
movement of the joining inner sides of said main bodies and 
a locking mechanism (5) rotatably engaged at one end of 
said main bodies, wherein 
the locking mechanism comprises a vertical manipulation 
member (6) and an actuation portion (7) disposed at the back 

of said manipulation member, in which 
the actuation member has an upper member (8) which is to 
be in contact with the upper surface of an engaging portion (16) 

on both corners of the joining inner sides at the 
longitudinal end of said main bodies and a lower member (9) 

which is to be in contact with a lower surface of said  
 

engaging portion upon manipulation, and in which 
said upper member (8) and said lower member (9) extend horizontally 
opposing to each other to define a gap (10) therebetween 

which is greater than the thickness of said engaging portion, 
whereby 
said upper member of the manipulation member is brought 
into contact with and immovably retains the upward movement 

of said main bodies in a vertically erected state of said 
manipulation member. 
A paper holder as defined in claim 1, wherein both 
corners of the joining inner sides at the end of the main 

bodies are cut off to define a recess and slits extended 
from both lateral ends of said recess, such that the upper 

member and the lower member of the actuation portion of 
the locking mechanism are received in said recess and

face of the engaging portion and both sides of said actuation 

portion are inserted and engaged in said slits.

manipulation member for restricting the longitudinal top 
end of the main bodies from rotation exceeding a predetermined

locking mechanism comprises a vertical manipulation member  

 
and a horizontal actuation portion integrally joined at 

the base end thereof with the lower end at the back of

fingers are joined to each other, 
a fulcrum portion is defined at an intermediate portion 
between the bottom end of the gap and the back of 

said manipulation member, fulcrum shafts are raised on 
both sides of said actuation portion above said intermediate 

position and engaged to pivotal recesses 22 formed 
at predetermined positions at the longitudinal end of said

body seizing members having the same inner size as the  

 
joining lateral size of the main bodies upon closure of 

the clipping fingers are protruded in the lower portion of

of said main bodies in flush with the extended surface of 
said actuation portion. 
A paper holder as defined in claim 1 or 7, wherein retaining 
fingers protrude from the upper surface on the outer 

corners at the longitudinal end of the main bodies, while
