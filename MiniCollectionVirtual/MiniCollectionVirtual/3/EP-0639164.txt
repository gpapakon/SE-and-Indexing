<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a ceramic product comprising the steps of preparing an aqueous slurry of a silica sol with a refractile material comprising a calcium or zirconium silicate, causing the slurry to gel by physical or chemical means to form a solid structure, and drying said structure to form a porous ceramic product. The product has a high green strength which nevertheless increases on heating, and may be used in building applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing ceramic products, in 
particular ceramic products with high unfired, or 
"green", strength, especially for use in buildings. It is known to produce fire resistant products for use in 
buildings and many of these comprise inorganic material such as 
asbestos bound together into a board or duct. Asbestos is no 
longer recommended for many applications. These products may 
take the form of board for use in partitioning or in cladding 
steel structures. It is important that this material is 
itself non-flammable and must exhibit poor thermal conductivity 
so that the temperature of the flame is dropped across the 
thickness of the material to an acceptable level. This is 
particularly important when encasing steel structures since in 
some cases the steel can reach a temperature where it will 
soften and deform. As ceramic products are fire resistant (although not 
necessarily having the low thermal conductivity of fireboard) 
they are useful as cladding products. However the green 
strength of most ceramic material limits the size and 
complexity of shape that can be made owing to handling problems 
before firing and/or glazing. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing a ceramic 
material which can be formed into boards or other products 
which have good fire resistance. Accordingly, there is 
provided a method of producing a ceramic product comprising the 
steps of preparing an aqueous slurry of a silica sol with a 
refractile material comprising an acicular calcium metasilicate 
wherein the range of particle sizes used and the total specific 
surface area of these particles in relation to the silica  
 
particles is such as to give high green strength, causing the 
slurry to gel by freeze moulding in a closed mould to form a solid structure and 
drying said structure to form a solid ceramic product. The refractile material, which should be insoluble 
in water, is a calcium meta-silicate. Preferably, the material 
includes both calcium and zirconium silicates. The product can be tailored, as explained more fully 
hereinafter, to produce a relatively lightweight fireboard or 
a high green strength ceramic board in large or complex shapes 
suitable for subsequent firing into a 'tile' (which term is to 
include moulded three-dimensional shapes as well as simple 
square or rectangular sheets). When the resultant product is a ceramic board, it has been 
found to have unexpectedly high green (unfired) strength and,

step of drying is carried out by firing the structure or by 

allowing the structure to dry under conditions substantially 
close to ambient.

slurry comprises a colloidal sol of silica having an average 

particle size less than 30 nanometers. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the

sawdust, polystyrene or the like, and which is burnt out during 
the step of firing or in a separate heat treatment, or a gas-forming 

agent.

thermally insulting or strengthening means comprising glass 

fibres, perlite, vermiculite, inorganic lamina, pulverised fuel 
ash, flake-like materials such as mica, or chopped fibres ,

product in its green state has a strength at least 5MPa and a 

fired strength in the range of 10MPa to 30MPa as determined by 
a modulus of rupture test.

proportion of calcium silicate should not exceed 65% (by 

weight) of the total slurry, and preferably be in the range 
20-40%.
