<ABSTRACT>
A drill guide (10) and method for guiding placement of external 
fixation pins in the bone (B) of a human limb to avoid an implanted 

intramedullary nail (14) with the drill guide means having a plurality of 
guide holes (24) adapted to guide and receive a bone drill bit and bone 

pins (18). The drill guide means also includes connecting means for 
connecting the drill guide means to one end of a drill guide handle 

(12) connected to an intramedullary nail implanted in the bone and for 
aligning the guide holes in a fixed position relative to the nail so that 

the hole centerlines are oriented to avoid the nail.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to drill guides used in orthopedic 
surgery, and more particularly to a drill guide and method for guiding 
the placement of external fixation pins in the bone of a human limb to 
avoid an implanted intramedullary nail. Limb lengthening and bone transport are often performed with 
external fixation devices that fix separate bone segments and then 
displace the bone segments axially. Bone lengthening procedures 
are performed with a variety of external fixation devices and the 
success of these procedures is influenced by the mechanical stability 
of the lengthening system used. When an intramedullary nail is used in conjunction with the 
external fixation device the stability of the lengthening system is 
greatly increased and the success of the lengthening system is 
enhanced. The external fixation frame is applied after the nail is 
implanted in the intramedullary canal of the bone being lengthened. 
The external frame is connected to the bone with various pins and 
wires and in connecting the frame to the bone it is necessary to place 
the pins and wires in the bone allowing for adequate bone purchase 
but without coming in contact with the implanted nail. Presently, the 
only way to miss the implanted intramedullary nail, when placing the 
fixation pins and wires in the bone, is by free-handing the insertion of 
the pins and wires with image intensification. Drill guides currently available are for guiding bone screws 
through implanted intramedullary nails for securing the nail in the 
intramedullary canal of a bone. These drill guides are connected to 
the implanted intramedullary nail and aid the surgeon in aligning the 
drill bit with the preformed holes in the intramedullary nail. With many intramedullary nail drill guides, a handle or some 
other device is aligned and securely fastened to the exposed 
proximal end of the implanted intramedullary nail. A second section 
of the drill guide has guide holes that align with the screw holes in 
the implanted nail when the guide is placed in proper alignment on 
the handle. The orientation of the drill guide insures that the holes 
drilled into the bone will align with the holes in the intramedullary nail 
for the proper placement of the bone screws.  It would be advantageous to have a radiolucent or 
radiotransparent drill guide for use in the placement of pins and wires 
connecting an external fixation frame to a bone that avoids an 
implanted intramedullary nail. It would also be advantageous to have 
a drill guide

<CLAIMS>
A drill guide for guiding placement of external fixation 
pins in the bone of a human limb while avoiding an implanted 

intramedullary nail, comprising: 

a) a drill guide means for guiding a drill bit so that 
external fixator pin holes can be formed in the bone of a human limb, 

the drill guide means including a drill guide body with a plurality of 
guide holes therethrough, each adapted to receive a drill bit and 

bone pins; 
b) the drill guide means including connecting 
means for connecting the drill guide means to the intramedullary nail 

implanted in the bone while aligning the guide holes in a fixed 
position relative to the nail so that the hole centerlines extend along a 

side of the nail, enabling a drill to track a selected opening during 
drilling, and avoid the nail. 
The drill guide of claim 1, wherein the drill guide means 
is elongated in shape with the plurality of guide holes oriented in two 

parallel rows positioned on the longitudinal axis of the drill guide 
means. 
The drill guide of claim 1, wherein the connecting 
means includes a slotted keyed hole for connecting and aligning the 

drill guide means on the drill guide handle connected to the 
implanted intramedullary nail. 
The drill guide of claim 3, wherein the keyed hole 
cooperates with a keyway on the drill guide handle connected to the 

implanted intramedullary nail for aligning the drill guide means with 
the implanted nail. 
The drill guide of claim 3, wherein the connecting 
means includes a screw means for tightening the slotted keyed hole 

 
of the drill guide means to the drill guide handle connected to the 

implanted intramedullary nail.
