Inflatable canopy (1) with a multi-foiled double wall which can be deployed and
which is retractable, enclosing a pressurised layer of air in between the walls and

comprising a plurality of inflatable hollow beams (A, B, C, ..., M,N) which are
distinct and placed side by side, each beam (A, B, C...) comprising four zones of

which two lateral zones form the webs (3, 4) and of which two respectively inner
and outer zones form the footings (5,6) of the said beam, characterised in that each

beam (A, B, C,...) is formed by a single continuous envelope (2) ensuring the
continuity of the sealing of the volume it confines and in that the homologous webs

(3, 4) of the two contiguous beams (A, B, C,...) are held opposite one another by
continuous and longitudinal flaps, being formed by a T-shaped section (10) whose

two wings(11, 12) are fixed to the envelope (2) of each beam (A, B, C, ...) and
whose central tongue (13) comprises mechanical connection means (15, 16, 17; 20,

21, 22) with the homologous section (10) of the contiguous beam.
Inflatable canopy according to claim 1, characterised in that the section (10) is
formed by folding at least one band of coated material.
Inflatable canopy according to claim 1 characterised in that the mechanical
connection means comprise:


eyelets (15) which are regularly spaced and placed opposite one another on
the tongues (13) of the two homologous sections (10) of the two contiguous

beams (A, B, C, ...)
continuous rings (16) held along the free edge of the corresponding tongue
(13)
at least one continuous link (17) threaded successively from top to bottom
and from bottom to top through the eyelet couples (15) placed opposite the

tongues (13) of the two homologous sections (10).
Inflatable canopy according to claim 1 characterised in that the mechanical
connection means are formed by sliding closures (20) each comprising two half-parts

(21, 22) hooking on to one another or unhooking one from the other as a 
cursor passes, each half part (21, 22) being fixed on the tongue (13) of one of the

two homologous sections (10) of the two contiguous beams (A, B, C, ...).
Inflatable canopy according to any of claims 1, 2 and 4 characterised in that each
tongue (13) of the sections (10) is formed from two parallel lips (13a, 13b) between

which is fixed a tape (23, 24) supporting one of two half parts (21, 22) of the
corresponding sliding closure (20).
Inflatable canopy according to any other the previous claims characterised in that
the webs (3, 4) and the footings (5, 6) forming the continuous envelope (2) of each

beam (A, B, C,..) are formed by cutting surfaces, the said sections (10) being fixed
along and on each side of the intersections (7) of the said surfaces.
Inflatable canopy according to any of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the webs
(3, 4) and the footings (5, 6) forming the envelope (2) of each beam (A, B, C, ..)

are formed by tangential surfaces between them, the said sections (10) being fixed
along the tangential lines of the said surfaces.
Inflatable canopy according to any of the previous claims characterised in that the
sections (10) situated on the same side of each beam (A, B, C, ...) are continuous

and form a loop (30) at each extremity of the said beam.
Inflatable canopy according to any of the previous claims characterised in that it
comprises mobile supporting iron work (31) placed between the extremities of the

two contiguous beams (A, B, C...) and connected to the sections (10) of the said
contiguous beams, at the level of the extremity loops (30) of the said sections (10)

by fixing means (35, 36), the said iron work (31) co-operating with a fixed base
(33) fitted with guiding means (34) whose profile determines a deployment and

folding path for each of the said beams.
Inflatable canopy according to claim 9, characterised in that the fixing means are
formed by bolted flaps (35) clamping the tongue (13) of the two contiguous

sections (10).
