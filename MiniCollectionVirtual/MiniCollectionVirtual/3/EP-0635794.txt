<ABSTRACT>
A document processing apparatus which permits 
the sharing of a document element in a document 

structure while keeping the consistency to the change 
of the content is provided. In a document processing 

apparatus for managing a plurality of documents each 
containing a plurality of document elements, a document 

element having a content to be shared with a second 

document is designated from a plurality of document 
elements of a first document, and the content of the 

designated document element is defined as a content of 
a predetermined document element of the second document 

to share a common content by the first and second 
documents. 
Further, in order to prevent a content shared 
by a plurality of document elements from being 

inadvertently broken by the edition to one document 
element, the document element having the shared content 

is detected from a document when the display of the 
document is commanded and it is displayed in a 

distinguishable manner from other portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to document
processing apparatus and method for managing a
plurality of documents each containing a plurality of
document elements.In a past, a cut and paste method has been used
as a method for defining a content of a document as a
content of another document. For example, let us
consider a case in which an abstract of a certain
number of articles are to be prepared.Fig. 2 shows article document data and Fig. 3
shows abstract document data. They follow the SGML
description method in which a document element starts
with a document element start symbol <xxx> and ends
with a document element end symbol </xxx>, where xxx
contains a document name of the document element. A
character string between the document element start
symbol and the document element end symbol represents
a document element content. It is assumed that the
document element comprises a document element name and
a document element content. Other secondary information
may also be included.Where a content "defg, hijk" of a document 
element <abstract> of the article document data of Fig.
2 is to be quoted as it is as a content of a document
element <itemparagraph> of the abstract document data
of Fig. 3, a content "lmno." of <itemparagraph> is
first erased, and the content "defg, hijk" of the
<abstract> is pasted in situ by the cut and paste
method.Alternatively, it may be realized by a
hyperdocument method. In this method, a link to a
content of other document data is pasted from a
certain portion of a document and a button 47 shown in
Fig. 4 is filled in that portion. When the button is
clicked, another window appears so that the content
of the other document data to which the link was
pasted is displayed.However, in the cut and paste method, since
the identical data are copied and present art two-locations
as separate data, when a common portion
is corrected in either one of the article or the
abstract and the both contents are to be matched, the
same correction is to be made for the other. This is
not effective because the same correction is to be
repeated twice, and if only one is corrected, the
conformity is lost.Further, in the method of pasting the link,
the above problem is solved but the button must be
clicked in order to display the document data to which 
the link was pasted, on the display, and where multiple
sharing is made in order to display it on other window
than that on which the document data having the button
embedded therein is displayed, the number of windows
increases and the windows
