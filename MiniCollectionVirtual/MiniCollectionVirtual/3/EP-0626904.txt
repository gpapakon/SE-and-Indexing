<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods of facing a surface of a weldable iron based material with a consumable iron based electrode and alloy forming elements by creating an electric arc between the electrode and the surface of the weldable base material effective to form a weld puddle of which the weldable base material provides from about 35 % to about 80 % by weight, and preferably a major portion, of the weld puddle formed by the electrode and the base plate and by depositing and melting a predetermined quantity of alloy forming elements in the weld puddle to form an alloy abrasion resistant or corrosion resistant facing. Also disclosed are plates having abrasion or corrosion resistant surfaces in which from about 35 % to about 80 % and preferably a major portion of the weld puddle formed by the electrode and the base material is the weldable iron based material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEEP COAT FACED PLATE AND METHODField of the InventionThe present invention is in the field of hardfacing and providing wear or corrosion resistance to industrial equipment. Background of the InventionHardfaced plate is a product manufactured to resist the abrasion of bulk materials such as earth, rock, ores, and other silicious materials. It is used in the construction and the protection of fabrications of many kinds.It consists of a base plate of any suitable analysis which has been weld overlaid with an alloy which contains typically up to 40% chromium carbide.Depending upon the alloy content and method of application, the overlay can contain several types of chromium carbides. Only the primary type of carbide has the high abrasion resistance needed to make this product outwear other overlays or hard metals of a low cost type. This is identified by the formula M7 C-j where M is an alloy of iron and chromium.Analysis of the individual carbides cannot be done with any common commercial equipment, but the carbide can be identified by its form and shape in a micrograph of the deposit.Common mild steel plate is used as the base plate for nearly all manufacture of this product as it is sufficient to supply whatever strength and shock resistance are needed and is most cost effective. 

 The preferred method of manufacture uses the bulkweld process wherein alloy powder and wire are melted together in a welding arc and simultaneously welded to the base plate while melting an amount of base plate to obtain a weld bond, such as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 3,076,888. Other patents illustrating hardfacing are U.S. Patent Nos. 3,000,094; 3,060,307; 3,062,948; 3,407,478; 3,494,749; 3,513,288; 3,517,156; 3,588,432; and 3,609,292.As the overlay is made by welding, it is not capable of precise parameters. There will be a typical variance between melting of about 20% or less base metal on the one hand and a lack of bond (no melted base metal) on the other hand. With lack of bond the overlay can break off, and with the heavier melting of base metal there is dilution of the overlay material with iron with the result that the type of carbides formed are low in abrasion resistance. In prior art processes, over 15% melted base material is not acceptable.In the present state of the art all of the iron intended to produce the alloy is supplied by the electrode, usually a wire but it can be a strip. Whatever amount of base metal is melted is for the purpose of producing a bond only.In the present art the unintentional
