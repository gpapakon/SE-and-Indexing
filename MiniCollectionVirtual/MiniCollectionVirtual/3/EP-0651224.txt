<ABSTRACT>
A clip for the retention of a round of ammunition in a 
desired position in a barrel is described, the clip being 

manufactured from a plastics material and comprising a 
generally cylindrical body portion; the body portion having 

a plurality of generally radially and axially directed 
grooves therein, said grooves being adapted to engage the 

tail fins of an associated round of ammunition; engagement 
means extending at leas part of the way around said body 

portion, said engagement means having a greater diameter 
than that of the body portion and being adapted to engage 

with a recess at the breech-end of an associated gun barrel 
to prevent forward movement; and a substantially central 

aperture to allow access to the propellant charge of the 
associated round of ammunition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clip device for locating 
a bomb or round of ammunition axially in the barrel of a 
gun or mortar, and preventing the bomb or ammunition from 
slipping forwards when the muzzle of the barrel is 
depressed. Our co-pending published patent application 
number WO 93/07439 
describes inter alia a breech loading mortar 
system having means for preventing a round of ammunition 
from slipping backwards after being loaded when the barrel 
is at a relatively high angle of elevation. However, 
equally important is the need to positively prevent the 
round of ammunition from sliding forwards after loading and 
prior to firing when the muzzle of the barrel is at a 
relatively low angle of depression. If the round were to 
slide forwards, the firing pin would be unable to reach and 
ignite the propellant charge.  
 French Patent No. 1, 515, 243 (Bayrou) (basis of preamble of claim 1) describes a cap for 
fitting to a round of ammunition for retaining the 
ammunition in position for firing. The cap has a hollow 
open cylindrical shaped body having bosses protruding 
inwardly from the circumference of the axial cylindrical 
walls of the body, and which are adapted to engage 
corresponding notches which have to be specially made in 
the vertical fins of the ammunition, to allow the 
ammunition to be held within the cap. Fitting of the 
ammunition into the cap is by exerting pressure against a 
spring in the cap, until the bosses clip into place over 
the notches in the fins of the ammunition, and then 
rotating the cap relative to the fins. According to the present invention there is provided an 
ammunition retaining clip for the retention of a round of 
ammunition in a desired position in a barrel, the clip 
comprising a generally cylindrical body portion having 
engagement means for engaging with a recess at the 
breech-end of a gun barrel to prevent forward movement, the 
engagement means extending at least part of the way around 
the body portion and having a greater diameter than that of 
the body portion. A substantially central aperture allows 
access to the propellant charge when the clip is connected 
to an associated round of ammunition. The invention is 
characterised by the clip being manufactured of plastic 
material and the generally ring-shaped cylindrical body  
 
portion having a plurality of generally radially and 
axially extending grooves with walls for positively 
engaging, when the clip is connected to an associated round 
of ammunition, the tail fins of a round
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ammunition retaining clip for the retention of a 
round of ammunition in a desired position in a barrel, said 

clip comprising a generally cylindrical body portion (12), 
said body portion (12) having 


engagement means (34) for engaging with a recess (46) 
at the breech-end of a gun barrel to prevent forward 

movement, said engagement means (34) extending at least 
part of the way around said body portion (12) and having a 

greater diameter than that of said body portion (12); and 
a substantially central aperture (24) to allow access, 
when the clip is connected to an associated round of 

ammunition, to the propellant charge of said ammunition 
 
characterised in that 


the clip is manufactured of plastic material; 
said generally ring-shaped cylindrical body portion 
(12) has a plurality of generally radially and axially 

extending grooves (14) with walls (44) for positively 
engaging, when the clip is connected to an associated round 

of ammunition, the tail fins (42) of a round of ammunition 
in such a way that the ammunition round does not become 

readily detached from the clip without a positive force, which 
is bigger than the gravity force,  

 
being applied, whereby said grooves (14) divide said body 

portion (12) into segments (16) having an outer diameter 
(18) and an inner diameter (20). 
An ammunition retaining clip according to Claim 1 
characterised in that the grooves (14) do not pass through 

the entire axial thickness of the body portion (12). 
An ammunition retaining clip according to claim 1 or 
Claim 2 characterised in that the engagement means (34) is 

selected from the group comprising: a continuous flange 
portion around the circumference of the body portion (12); 

a discontinuous flange portion around the circumference; 
and, projections around the circumference.  

 
An ammunition retaining clip according to claim 3 
characterised in that the flange portion is located 

substantially at one axial end of the body portion (12). 
An ammunition retaining clip according to any one 
preceding claim characterised in that the clip is provided 

with generally axially directed holes (36) to facilitate 
placement and removal. 
An ammunition retaining clip according to any one 
preceding claim characterised in that the segments (16) 

formed between adjacent grooves may be resiliently moveable 
relative to each other. 
An ammunition retaining clip according to any one 
preceding claim characterised in that said plastic material 

of the clip is an acetal co-polymer. 
An ammunition retaining clip according to any one 
preceding claim characterised by additional grooves (14) 

over and above the number required to engage the tail fins 
(42) of the round of ammunition. 
An ammunition retaining clip according to any one 
preceding claim characterised in that the base of said 

grooves (14) have one or more apertures therein.
