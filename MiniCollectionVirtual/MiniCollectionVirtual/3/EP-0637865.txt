<ABSTRACT>
The reliability of transformer differential relays is 
enhanced by providing a method and apparatus which enable improved 

discrimination between transformer current differentials 
due to transformer inrush current and current differentials due 

the occurrence of an internal fault. This improvement in discrimination 
is provided by generating a first signal representative 

of currents flowing in at least two windings of the transformer, 
a second signal representative of a positive portion of 

the first signal, and a third signal representative of a negative 
portions of the first signal. A first output signal is generated 

when the magnitude of the second signal exceeds a first predetermined 
value, and a second output signal is generated when the 

magnitude of the third signal exceeds a second predetermined 
value. A trip signal is generated upon coincidence of the first 

and second output signals. Additional operate energy is generated 
when the magnitude of the absolute value of a vector sum operate 

signal, representative of the vector sum of currents flowing in 
at least two windings of the transformer, exceeds a first predetermined 

magnitude. The additional operate energy is terminated 
and additional restraint energy is generated when the magnitude 

of a percentage restraint signal, representative of the absolute 
values of currents flowing in a least two windings of the transformer, 

exceeds a second predetermined magnitude for a predetermined 
period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to protective relay circuits for
use in AC power distribution systems and more particularly to
transformer differential relays.As part of the protection scheme for AC power distribution
systems, it is desirable to detect faults occurring within
the transformers used in the system. Upon detection of a fault
within the transformer, circuit breakers are operated to disconnect
the input and/or the output of the transformer thereby protecting
the transformer as well as those portions of the power
distribution system connected to the transformer.Transformer differential relays have been used in the
past to detect faults within a transformer. Such relays operate
upon the theory that, in an unfaulted transformer, the current Ip
in the input windings is equal to the current Is in the output
windings multiplied by the output to input winding turns ratio
Rt; that is, Ip = Rt Is. Upon occurrence of an internal fault,
the quantities Ip and Rt Is are no longer equal. Accordingly, a
transformer differential relay continuously compares the magnitude
of the quantities Ip and Rt Is and will generate a trip
signal when the difference between the quantities Ip and Rt Is
exceeds a predetermined maximum. The trip signal is used to
operate one or more circuit breakers in order to disconnect the 
input and/or the output of the faulted transformer from the power
distribution system. Such a relay is shown in EP-A-0249215.Although transformer differential relays work well to
detect the occurrence of internal faults, they have been known to
erroneously generate a trip signal as a result of transformer
inrush current. Transformer inrush current occurs as a result of
the application of voltage to the input windings. Voltage is
applied to the transformer input windings when, for example, the
system is initially powered or following the clearance of a fault
in the system. The presence of inrush current causes a difference
to occur in the quantities Ip and Rt Is. When the difference
exceeds the predetermined maximum, occasionally the relay
will generate a trip signal even thought the difference was
caused by inrush current and not by an internal fault. As a
result, the reliability of the relay and consequently the reliability
of the entire AC power distribution system incorporating
such a relay is diminished.Illustrative embodiments of the present invention seek
to provide:
a an apparatus for enhancing the reliability
of transformer differential relays;an apparatus which enable transformer
differential relays to
