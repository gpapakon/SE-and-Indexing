<ABSTRACT>
The building module, designed to be transportable by road, rail or air within the volume of a rigid central section (1) with a frame preferably of metal, has two folding side sections, each with a roof (2, 5), wall (3, 6) and floor (4, 7) members. The roof member of each side section is hinged to the fixed roof of the rigid central section, and the floor member is hinged to the floor of the central section, with the wall member hinged to the outer ends of both roof and floor members. The folding side sections are deployed from the central rigid section in stages to form the extended building once delivered to its site.
