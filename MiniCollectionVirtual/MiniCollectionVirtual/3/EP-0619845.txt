<DESCRIPTION>
 SOLID METAL-CARBON MATRIX OF METALLOFULLERITES AND METHOD OF FORMING SAMEField of the InventionThe present invention relates to metals and metal alloys such as ferro-carbon steels, and in particular relates to a novel crystalline structure for a steel or steel-like material in which the carbon is present in the form of fullerene molecules and forms a etallofullerite lattice with the iron.Back round of the Invention Steel is the term used to refer to alloys of iron and small percentages of carbon. In some nomenclatures, steel refers to any alloy in which carbon is present in amounts of between about 0.02 and 1.5% carbon by weight, but in other uses refers to alloys containing up to 2.25% or more carbon. Although the exact percentage borderline may differ depending upon the nomenclature, alloys with higher carbon contents are usually referred to as "cast iron" rather than as steel.As is known to those generally familiar with steels, the iron and carbon are present in two main constituents, ferrite (iron) and cementite, an iron carbide compound having the general chemical formula Fe3C. Most steels will also contain additional elements such as manganese, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur, oxygen, and traces of others. Other steels contain considerable percentages of elements such as nickel, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium or titanium which give the resulting steel various appropriate or desired properties.As known to those skilled in a variety of arts, steel is used in construction, ship hulls, auto bodies, machinery and machine parts, cables, abrasives, chemical equipment, and numerous other uses such as belts for tire reinforcement and the like. Within these uses, steel desirably should exhibit a number of metallic properties including compressive strength, tensile strength, ductility, hardness, and other related properties that are advantageously characteristic of useful metals."Fullerenes" is a term given to a recently postulated 

 and discovered form of molecular carbon in which the carbon atoms are joined to form spheres, or sphere-like structures. Because of the resemblance between the structure of these molecules and the geodesic domes designed and championed by the architect Buck inster Fuller, such molecules have been designated as "fullerenes", and the basic and most stable molecule, a sphere having 60 carbon atoms, has been designated "buckminsterf llerene". For the same reasons, fullerenes have also been referred to as "buckyballs." The best available evidence indicates that fullerene molecules
