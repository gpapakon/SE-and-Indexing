<ABSTRACT>
Coupling for rotating shafts with a coupling-ring arrangement consisting of three concentric coupling rings which are rotatably mounted one below the other on lubricated cylindrical rollers and are each connected via links to an input coupling half and an output coupling half. The cylindrical rollers are arranged in annular grooves and roll on wear-resistant running bushes which are inserted in pairs in adjacent coupling rings. Arranged on both sides of the annular grooves, in regions of the coupling rings near to the edge, are contact seals for sealing off the rolling bearings. According to the invention, the outer coupling ring is of one-piece design. The outer running bush fitted into it extends over virtually the entire width of the outer coupling ring. At least one annular groove for the cylindrical rollers arranged between the central and the outer coupling rings is machined into the outer running bush. In addition, the outer running bush has collar surfaces at the ends and the contact seals between the central and outer coupling rings rest in sliding fashion against these surfaces.
