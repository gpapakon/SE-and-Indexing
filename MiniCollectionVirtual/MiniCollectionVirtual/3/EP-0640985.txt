generating and selectively supplying a relatively high 

negative voltage to control gates of memory cells in 
selected half-sectors via wordlines in an array of flash 

EEPROM memory cells during flash erasure. The distributed 
negative gate power supply includes a main charge 

pumping circuit (20a, 20b), a plurality of distribution 
sector pumping means (18a-18p). Each of the plurality of 

distribution sector pumping circuits is responsive to a 
half-sector select signal for selectively connecting the 

primary negative voltage to the wordlines of the selected 
half-sectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to floating gate
memory devices such as an array of flash electrically
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) cells
with page erase and negative voltage gate erase. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a distributed
negative gate power supply for generating and
selectively supplying a relatively high negative voltage
to control gates of memory cells in selected half-sectors
via wordlines in an array of flash EEPROM memory cells
during flash erasure.In our co-pending European application 93307047.6 (EP-A-0,594,293), to
which reference can be made, there is described a negative power supply for
generating and supplying a regulated potential to control
gates of selected memory cells via wordlines in an array 
of flash EEPROM memory cells during flash erasure.
In Figure 1 of EP-A-0 594 293,
there is shown a block diagram of the negative
power supply 10 which includes a clock circuit 14
for generating a plurality of clock signals and a charge
pumping circuit 12 responsive to an external power supply
potential VCC and to the clock signals for generating a
high negative voltage. A cancellation circuit is coupled
to the charge pumping circuit for effectively canceling
out threshold voltage drops therein.The charge pumping circuit 12 of EP-A-0 594 293
is formed of a plurality of charge pumping stages.
A negative well circuit 20 is coupled to the plurality of
charge pumping stages for preventing initially the
operation of a certain number of the plurality of charge
pumping stages during erasure. A regulator circuit 16 is
responsive to the high negative voltage and a reference
potential for generating a negative comparator signal
which is either at a high level so as to allow the charge
pumping circuit to increase the high negative voltage or
at a low level so as to decrease the high negative voltage
and for generating the regulated negative potential
that is independent of the power supply potential VCC.The charge pumping circuit 12 and the negative well
circuit 20 represent only one of the sixteen charge
pumping circuits used on the integrated circuit chip
containing the array of flash EEPROM memory cells. Each
one of the charge pumping circuits is associated with one 
of the eight half-sectors in either the left or right side of the array. Further, the high
negative voltage NEGOUT from each of the pumping circuits is coupled to the wordlines
via a plurality of diode-connected P-channel transistors P9 as shown in Figure 4(c) of
EP-A-0 594 293 application.
