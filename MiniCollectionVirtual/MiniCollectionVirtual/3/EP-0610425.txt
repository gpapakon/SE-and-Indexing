<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a polyimide film having a preselected value 
for coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). More 
particularly, it relates to the process in which a 
combination of chemical and processing factors is used 
to control the CTE. Polyimides constitute a class of valuable polymers 
characterized by high strength, thermal stability, inert 
character, and high Tg, among other properties. 
Polyimides find extensive use in electronic applications 
where they are useful in forming dielectric films in 
electrical and electronic devices such as motors, 
capacitors, semiconductors, printed circuit boards and 
other packaging structures. Typical uses for polyimides 
include protective and stress buffer coatings for 
semiconductors, dielectric layers for multilayer 
integrated circuits and multi-chip modules, high 
temperature solder masks, bonding layers for multilayer 
circuits, final passivating coatings on electronic 
devices and the like. The increased complexity of the applications for 
polyimides, especially in the area of electronics, has 
placed a greater demand on the ability to tailor the 
properties of the polyimide for a specific application. 
Microelectronic devices often consist of multilayer 
structures with alternating layers of conductors (metals  
 
or semiconductors) isolated by layers of dielectric 
insulators (e.g., polyimides). The manufacture of these 
devices often involves a sequence of high temperature 
heating and cooling cycles. Stresses can be generated 
during these processes due to differences between the 
thermal expansion and moduli of the various layers of 
materials. These stresses may degrade the performance 
of the device and/or lead to premature device failure. As electronic components become smaller, the 
control of stress becomes an even greater concern. A 
large part of the stress is related to the difference in 
the thermal expansion of the components. It is 
therefore desirable to be able to control the 
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for dielectric 
materials so that it can be matched as closely as 
possible to the CTE's of other materials in the device. Examples of high and low CTE polyimides have been 
disclosed in, for example, U.S.-A-4,690,999 and 
4,137,933. However, it is frequently desirable to 
control the CTE more precisely and it is also necessary 
to take into consideration the other properties of the 
polyimide, e.g., electrical, mechanical and chemical 
properties. It therefore would be desirable to
