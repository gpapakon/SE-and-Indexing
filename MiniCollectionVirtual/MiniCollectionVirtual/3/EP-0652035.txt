<ABSTRACT>
In-line roller skates whose wheels make it possible for 
a skater to stop without the need for a braking pad or other 

special expedients for this purpose. Each skate includes a 
boot to accommodate the skater's foot and a frame secured to 

the underside of the boot supporting a series of in-line 
wheels having a composite structure. Each composite wheel 

includes a center section formed of hard material, such as 
high-density polyethylene, having a low coefficient of 

friction, the center section being flanked by side sections 
formed of relatively soft material, such as cast 

polyurethane, having a high coefficient of friction. In 
order to stop or reduce speed, the skater turns the in-line 

skates away from the direction of travel as he would when 
braking ice skates. This maneuver causes a portion both of 

the hard and a soft section of the composite wheels, now 
angled with respect to the direction of travel, to 

frictionally engage the ground to effect a braking action.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to in-line roller 
skates, and more particularly to composite wheels for such 
skates which make it possible to skate in control at any 
speed, yet to slow down and stop easily without the need for 
a brake pad or other special expedients for this purpose. In-line roller skates are often referred to as 
ROLLERBLADE skates, this being the trademark for the best 
known brand of such skates. In a skate of this type, each  
 
foot of the skater is received in a boot having attached to 
its underside a frame supporting a set of wheels in tandem 
relation. In an in-line skate the wheels are aligned in a 
single row rather than in parallel rows as in a conventional 
roller skate. The in-line wheels are so shaped and placed 
as to allow tilting of the skate as much as 30 degrees from 
the vertical without substantially reducing the ground 
contact area of the wheels. Using standard in-line roller skates, a skilled skater 
can attain speeds exceeding 30 miles per hour on a flat 
pavement or other road surface, a far greater speed than is 
achievable with conventional roller skates. These high speed 
make it difficult and sometimes dangerous for the skater to 
quickly brake, particularly when faced with an unexpected 
obstacle requiring the skater to come to an abrupt halt to 
avoid a collision. According to American Sports Data, in-line roller 
skating is the fastest growing sport in our nation. As more 
in-line skaters take to the road, skating-related injuries 
continue to rise. It is generally recognized that the key 
to safe in-line roller skating is effective stopping and 
speed control, and that most accidents occur because of the 
inability of the skater to brake without losing his balance. In standard in-line roller skates, mounted at the rear 
of the right skate is a heel brake provided with a soft 
rubber pad. To effect stopping, the skater must shift most 
of his weight onto the non-braking left skate while upwardly 
tilting the toe of his right skate and pressing the heel 
brake against the road surface. This braking maneuver is not easy to execute. As a 
consequence, inexperienced in-line roller skaters who have 
difficulty controlling their speed, usually lose their 
balance when trying to operate the heel brake. These novice 
skaters may then resort to a crash landing or spilling onto 
the grass or dirt on the side of the road. In either case, 
the skater may suffer broken wrists and arms, fractured  
 
shoulders or collar bones, or back and ankle sprains. More

<CLAIMS>
An in-line roller skate capable of riding at high 
speed on a skating surface and of being braked by a skater 

by a maneuver in which the skate is angled with respect to 
a direction of forward motion, said roller skate comprising: 


A. a boot for accommodating a foot of the skater; 
B. a frame secured to the boot; and 
C. a set of wheels supported for rotation in tandem 
relation on said frame; the wheels in the set having a 

composite structure including a central portion providing 
means for sliding formed of a material exhibiting a very low 

coefficient of sliding friction having a slippery surface 
flanked by side portions providing means for braking formed 

of a material exhibiting a relatively high coefficient of 
sliding friction, the relative values of sliding friction 

being such that when the skate travels in the forward 
direction, the wheels then roll on this surface, and when the 

skate is angled with respect to the forward direction to 
effect a stopping action, this maneuver causes the wheels to 

slide on their central portion on the skating surface, the 
side portion of the wheels then acting to frictionally engage 

the skating surface to slow down the slide to effect a 
braking action. 
A roller skate as set forth in claim 1 in which the 
frame includes a pair of parallel side rails, each wheel 

being mounted on an axle bridging the side rails. 
A skate as set forth in claim 1, in which side 
portions are formed of a material chosen from a class 

consisting of soft polyurethane, soft silicone and soft 
rubber. 
A skate as set forth in claim 1, wherein the 
interface between the center portion and the side portions 

is wavy. 
A composite wheel for an in-line roller skate 
comprising: 


A. a central portion providing means for sliding 
formed of a material exhibiting a very low coefficient of 

sliding friction that render the central portion slippery on 
a road surface; and 
B. side portions flanking the central portion 
providing means for braking formed of a material exhibiting 

a relatively high coefficient of sliding friction to impart 
traction to the side portions, the relative values of sliding 

friction being such that when the skate travels in a 
direction of forward motion on a skating surface, the 

composite wheel then rolls on the skating surface, and when 
the skate is angled with respect to the direction of forward 

motion, the composite wheel then slides on its central 
portion and said side portions frictionally engaging the 

skating surface to slow down the slide to effect a braking 
action. 
A wheel for a roller skate, particularly but not 
exclusively an in-line roller skate, or a roller skate 

having at least one such wheel, the wheel having a first 
circumferential portion formed of a relatively hard material 

and a second circumferential portion formed of a relatively 
soft material, the first portion being the portion of the 

wheel which contacts the skating surface in normal running 
of the skate and the second portion being axially offset 

from the first portion to enable a braking action when the 
skate is angled with respect to the direction of motion.
