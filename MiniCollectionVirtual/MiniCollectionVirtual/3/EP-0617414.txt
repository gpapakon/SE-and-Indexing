<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium having good high density 
recording characteristics is produced by forming a magnetic layer on 

a substrate which is traveling around a peripheral surface of a cylindrical 
can by an oblique vapor deposition method to form a magnetic 

layer comprising cobalt an axis of easy magnetization of which 
inclines from a normal line of the layer plane, in which a residual 

gas pressure in an initial region of the formation of the magnetic 
layer is kept as low as possible, in particular, the residual gas 

pressure in the initial region of the formation of the magnetic layer 
is lower than other part of a production apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for producing a magnetic recording medium.As recording density of a magnetic read/write equipment
has been increased year by year, it is highly desired to provide
a magnetic recording medium which is excellent in read/write
characteristics in a short wavelength range. Today, a coating type
magnetic recording medium in which magnetic powder is coated on a
substrate is mainly used, and its properties are being improved to
satisfy the above desire. However, the improvement of the property
is nearing its limit.One of magnetic recording media which can exceed this
limit is a thin film magnetic recording medium. The thin film
magnetic recording medium is produced by a vacuum deposition
method, a sputtering method or a plating method and has excellent
read/write characteristic in a short wavelength range. Examples of
magnetic materials used in the thin film magnetic recording medium
are Co, Co-Ni, Co-Ni-P, Co-O, Co-Ni-O, Co-Fe-O, Co-Ni-Fe-O, Co-Cr,
Co-Ni-Cr, and the like. Among them, a layer of a partial oxide such
as Co-O and Co-Ni-O are the most suitable in view of the practical
application in a magnetic tape, and a deposition tape comprising a Co-Ni-O
magnetic layer is practically used as a Hi-8 type video tape. One embodiment of the production method of a deposition
tape will be explained by making reference to Fig. 1, which schematically
illustrates an example of an inner structure of a known continuous
vacuum deposition apparatus (EP-A-0 529 673).A substrate 1 made of, for example, a polymer film is
unwound from a supply roll 3, travels around a peripheral surface of
a cylindrical can 2 in a direction of an arrow, and finally wound on a
take-up roll 4.A vapor of a raw magnetic material such as metal cobalt
or a cobalt alloy is evaporated from an evaporation source 5 and
deposited on the substrate 1 to form a magnetic layer on the substrate
1. As the evaporation source 5, an electron beam evaporation
source is preferred, since it can evaporate a high melting point such
as cobalt, at a high evaporation rate.Between the evaporation source 5 and the cylindrical can
2, there are provided two shielding plates 61 and 62, which prevent
excessive deposition of the atom vapor on the substrate 1 and define
a range of an incident angle of the atom vapor on the substrate 1.The incident angle is defined as an angle between an
incident direction of the atom vapor and a normal line to the substrate
1. The shielding plate 61 defines an initial incident angle i of
