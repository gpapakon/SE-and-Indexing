<ABSTRACT>
A sealing frame (25) for a heat-sealable film, comprising 
a fixed portion (23) and a movable portion (24), the 

movable portion being articulated so that it can be moved 
close to the fixed portion by a movement actuator (13). A 

yieldable connecting device (10) is interposed between the 
actuator (13) and movable portion, which device (10) 

comprises one element (16) connected to the actuator and a 
second element (14) connected to the movable portion (24). 

The first and second elements are mutually hinged and a 
spring (18) is interposed therebetween. An electric switch 

(19) for stopping the actuator (13) movement in the 
direction of moving the frame portions close to each other 

is interposed between said first and second elements. The 
switch is thus operated when the spring compression 

exceeds a predetermined amount indicating the presence of 
obstacles to the movement of the movable portion (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealing frame the 
movements of which are executed in a safe manner. Packaging machines are known in which provision is made 
for a sealing frame designed to join together the 
peripheral edges of two sheets made of a heat 
sealable-material between which the goods to be packaged 
are interposed. The sealing frame generally comprises a 
fixed and a movable portion facing each other, wherein the 
movable portion is moved by actuators so that the plastics 
film is clamped between said two portions and sealing of 
same is carried out. Machines are known, for example, in 
which the movable portion of the sealing frame is 
comprised of a dome-shaped covering for a cell carrying 
out heat-shrinkage of the plastics film, so that cutting, 
sealing and heat-shrinkage of the package can be executed 
simultaneously. It will be recognized that when the frame (provided with a 
dome-shaped covering or not) is moved upwardly and 
downwardly automatically by a servo-mechanism, the unwary 
introduction of one hand into the operating field of the 
machine may be very dangerous.  
 DE-2.520.475 discloses a sealing frame in which a 
protection element surrounds the movable portion. The 
protection element is resiliently supported on the movable 
portion. Upon mutual movement between the movable portion 
and the protection (for example, when the hand is 
introduced in the operating field) a switch is actuated 
and the movement of the movable portion is stopped. The general object of the present invention is to obviate 
the above mentioned drawback by providing a sealing frame 
provided with a mechanical safety linkage for carrying out 
movements of same, capable of avoiding the blades closing  
 
when an obstacle whatever is encountered, for example the 
operator's hands. In view of the above object, in accordance with the 
invention, a sealing frame for a heat-sealable film has 
been devised which comprises a fixed and a movable sealing 
portion, the movable portion being articulated so that it 
can be moved close to the fixed portion by a movement 
actuator 
for sealing a film between the sealing portions, 
characterized in that a yieldable connecting 
device is interposed between the movement actuator and 
movable portion, which device comprises one element 
connected to the actuator and a second element connected 
to the movable portion, said first and second elements 
being hinged on each other so that they mutually move on 
operation of the actuator at least in a direction in which

A sealing frame (25) for a heat-sealable film 
comprising a fixed sealing portion (23) and a movable sealing portion (24), the 

movable portion being articulated so that it can be moved 
close to the fixed portion by a movement actuator (13) 

for sealing a film between the sealing portions (23, 24), 
characterized in that a yieldable connecting device (10) 

is interposed between the movement actuator (13) and 
movable portion, which device (10) comprises one element 

(16) connected to the actuator and a second element (14) 
connected to the movable portion (24), said first and 

second elements being hinged on each other so that they 
mutually move on operation of the actuator at least in a 

direction in which the movable portion moves close to the 
fixed portion, the mutual movement taking place against 

the action of a spring (18) disposed between the first and 
second elements for transmitting an operating force 

between the actuator and movable portion (24), an electric 
switch (19) for stopping the actuator (13) movement in 

said moving-close direction being interposed between said 
first and second elements, said switch being operated when 

the mutual movement exceeds a predetermined amount which 
is established as an indication that a transmission force 

of the spring exceeds a predetermined value, which means 
stopping of movement in a moving-close direction in the 

presence of obstacles to said movement.  
 
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
second element (14) is integral with the movable portion  

 
(24) and the first element is a lever (16) pivoted at one 

end thereof on the second element and pivotally connected 
at the other end to the actuator, which end reacts on the 

spring (18). 
A frame according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
second element is in the form of a supporting plate (14) 

to which the switch (19) body is fastened, a switch 
driving key (21) being disposed along the path of an 

actuating element (20) supported by the lever (16) for 
pressing the switch driving key (21) on movement of the 

lever a predetermined amount about its pivot point. 
A frame according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
actuating element (20) is embodied by the tail of a screw 

threadedly passing through the lever (16) in the direction 
of the lever movement towards the switch driving key (21), 

so that it carries out the adjustment of the predetermined 
amount of movement necessary for the switch operation. 
A frame according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
second element (14) comprises a first limit stopper (22) for 

stopping movement of the first element (16) in the 
direction opposite to that in which the fixed and movable 

portions move close to each other. 
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
movable portion (24) is pivoted according to a rotational 

axis, the actuator being a rectilinear actuator the 
connection of which enables the movable portion to rotate 

between a first and a second angular position. 
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that the  
 

movable portion (24) defines a peripheral edge of a 
dome-shaped covering (11) for a cell carrying out 

heat-shrinkage in a packaging machine. 
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises another switch (27) for detecting the frame 

closure, said second switch inhibiting the stopping effect 
produced by the first switch (19) on detection that a 

position close to the frame closure position has been 
reached. 
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises a second limit stopper (28) stopping the mutual 

movement between the first and second elements, when the 
predetermined amount has been exceeded. 
A frame according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the second limit stopper (28) is 
a pin coaxial with the spring 
(18).
