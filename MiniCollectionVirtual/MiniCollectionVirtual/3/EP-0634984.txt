<ABSTRACT>
A railway vehicle of modular construction which comprises a chassis module (2) and a car body module (1), which are each manufactured as separate units and subsequently assembled into a complete vehicle by connecting the chassis module (2), which at the top has a top section (4) adapted to fill up a longitudinal opening in the floor of the car body, to the car body module (1) by a preferably dismountable friction joint (3). The top section (4) of the chassis module (2) is built up around an apparatus plate (8) which, interalia, supports the electrical and drive equipment of the vehicle. The chassis module (2) constitutes a whole or is composed of one or more building blocks, which are joined together into the final chassis module (2). Such building blocks consist, for example, of a chassis frame corresponding to the load- and apparatus- receiving part (9) of the chassis module and a driving element comprising a bogie (6) and traction units (7). The car body module (1) may also comprise a roof module (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a railway vehicle in which
the assembly into a complete unit is achieved by joining
together a chassis module and a car body module.In the production of rail-mounced vehicles in assembly
factories, it is common for the whole vehicle to be
assembled integrally, that is, that supporting structural
parts in a car, such as frameworks and floor spars together
with walls, roofs, floors etc. are assembled into a complete
coach, also by the supply of wheel sets, possible traction
units, electrical equipment and other accessories. This
assembly takes place locally and requires coordination of
the production. In addition, certain installation work may
be difficult since certain features, such as electrical
equipment for power supply, brake equipment and traction
units etc. are installed from below. An example of an
assembly according to such a technique in a coach without
motion by motor is given in German patent specification DE 3
019 843 C2.To facilitate assembly of a car according to the above, it
is desirable to manufacture a car by assembly of different
units which have been semi-manufactured and are thereafter
assembled into a complete car. In patent specification DE 2
933 429 C2, a solution is described in which a number of
building blocks are joined together into a final design.
According to this specification, this provides the
possibility and the advantage that the building blocks
included in the car are replaceable, which is an advantage
when, for example, building blocks have to be replaced owing 
to damage. The main building parts are a floor- or bottom
part, side wall parts, a roof part and frontal parts at the
longitudinal ends of the railway vehicle. All the building
blocks are at the same site of assemblage assembled, one by
one, by screwing or welding directly or indirectly to the
bottom building part which forms the base part. Only after
the shell of the railway vehicle has been assembled in this
manner the fitting of the remaining parts, such as bogies,
doors, electrical installation and the inside finishing with
furniture and appliances takes place. This often calls for
uncomfortable and time-consuming mounting procedures, such
as overhead working under the floor of the railway vehicle.A similar procedure as in DE-C-2 933 429 for assembling a
bus or a tram is disclosed in WO-A-9 118 780.The invention aims at developing a railway vehicle of modular
construction of the above-mentioned kind which enables a
simplified installation of equipment and accessories and
