<ABSTRACT>
The honing tool (1) has radially feedable honing strips 916) which are radially moved by means of an axially adjustable feeder (11). The feeder has wedge surfaces (131 and 132) to which are allocated counter-wedge surfaces (181 and 182). Unlike the usual design of such honing tools, the counter wedge surfaces (181 and 182) are not fitted on the honing strip bearers (15) but on supports (14) bearing on the adjuster (13) of the feeder (11) and on which the honing strip bearers (15) are supported to slide axially. This means that the axial shifts of the honing strips (16) which often occur in honing do not have the effect of shifting movements between the wedge surfaces (131 and 132) and their counter wedge surfaces (181 and 182), and thus undesirable feed movements of the honing strips (16) are prevented.
