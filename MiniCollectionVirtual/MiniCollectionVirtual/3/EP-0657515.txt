<ABSTRACT>
Adhesion promoting compositions are disclosed 
herein for bonding a layer of organic polymer to a layer of 

organosiloxane elastomer during curing of the elastomer in 
the presence of moisture. Our compositions comprise a 

solubilized copolymer comprising units derived from at least 
one ethylenically unsaturated organic compound and at least 

one silane containing an ethylenically unsaturated organic 
group and at least two silicon-bonded hydrolyzable groups 

per molecule. If greater bonding strength is desired, our 
composition further comprises an organohydrogensiloxane, an 

alkyl orthosilicate and an organotitanium compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for cohesively 
bonding organic polymer substrates to organosiloxane 
elastomers during the curing of the moisture-curable 
compositions used to form said elastomers. The adhesion 
promoting compositions used in this invention do not contain 
the objectionable ingredients of some prior art compositions 
used for bonding such elastomers to organic polymers. A disadvantage that may prevent wide acceptance of 
adhesion promoting compositions described in Unites States 
Patent Nos. 4,795,775 and 4,719,262 is the toxicity of some 
organosilicon compounds containing the bis-silylalkane group 
that can be present in these compositions. Organosilicon 
compounds containing the bis-silylethane group, represented 
by the formula ≡SiCH₂CH₂Si≡, are particularly undesirable. 
This disadvantage has stimulated a search for less toxic 
organosiloxane adhesion promoters suitable for use with 
organosiloxane compositions that cure by a platinum 
catalyzed hydrosilation reaction. Primer compositions containing various 
combinations of organosilicon compounds with alkyl 
orthosilicates and/or organohydrogensiloxanes are described 
in the prior art, including US-A 4,491,650; US-A 4,900,362; 
CA-A 2,069,564 and JP-A 3/028283. Our invention defines a class of adhesion 
promoting compositions that will provide the excellent 
bonding characteristic of compositions containing bis(trialkoxysilyl)alkane 
units without the toxicity normally 
associated with these compounds.  The present invention provides an adhesion-promoting 
primer composition comprising a copolymer derived 
from at least one ethylenically unsaturated organic compound 
and at least one silane containing an ethylenically 
unsaturated organic group bonded to silicon through carbon 
and at least two silicon-bonded hydrolyzable groups per 
molecule. These primer compositions are particularly 
suitable for achieving bonding between elastomers prepared 
from moisture curable organosiloxane compositions and the 
amorphous or "glassy" types of organic polymers such as 
polymethyl methacrylates and polycarbonates. A preferred 
application for laminates prepared using the present method 
is as windows, wind screens and other structures requiring 
optical clarity. This invention provides a method for bonding an 
organic polymer substrate to a cured organosiloxane 
elastomer during the curing of said elastomer in the 
presence of atmospheric moisture, said method comprising the 
steps of 1) coating a bonding surface of at least one of the
