<ABSTRACT>
Fungicidally treated laminar, cellulosic packaging material, e.g. for wrapping detergent composition especially in bar form, characterised in that the fungicide is trapped within paricles of a polymer which is a surface coating on the packaging material, the coating containing 0.001 to 1.0 gram fungicide per square metre.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fungicidally-treated 
packaging materials. There are a number of instances where 
products are packaged in a material which requires 
fungicidal treatment in order to inhibit mould growth on the 
packaging. The invention is particularly applicable to 
packaging materials which are of a cellulosic character such 
as paper and fibre board. An application which is particularly envisaged for 
the present invention is the wrapping employed for bars of 
soap and other detergent compositions in bar form. Soap is 
generally wrapped in a paper wrapping. Such a paper 
wrapping is capable of supporting a growth of a mould. The 
mould growth can progress to the point at which it 
discolours the packaging material, possibly contaminates the 
soap wrapped therein and in any event renders the product 
unattractive and unfit for sale. The problem can be 
particularly acute in humid tropical climates. The present technique for inhibiting mould growth 
is to incorporate a fungicide into the paper or other 
cellulosic material used for packaging. A potential 
difficulty with this is that some fungicides are capable of 
migrating from the packaging. Migration can be outward from 
the packaging into the surrounding environment or inwardly  
 
into the product enclosed by the packaging. Both are 
undesirable, resulting in loss of fungicidal protection of 
the packaging. This can prevent the use of fungicides which 
would otherwise be desirable. US-A-4533435 discloses the incorporation of an 
antimicrobial additive into the polymer binder which is used 
to make paper. The additive is added to the pre-formed 
binder and is stated to be in colloidal suspension in the 
binder. The binder is then used to make paper. This 
document teaches that the antimicrobial additive is free to 
migrate from the binder to adjacent fibres and to the 
surface of the paper. Plainly, if the antimicrobial 
additive is free to migrate in this way it can migrate 
onwards into anything which is in contact with the paper. Fungicidal paper and board packaging material is also 
disclosed in US-A-3521741. Additionally, fungicidal particles trapped or 
encapsulated within polymer particles are known from EP-A-0252463 
and US-A-4353962. Surprisingly, we have now found that it is possible to 
confer fungicidal protection to packaging material by 
applying fungicide trapped in a polymer coating. The 
polymer coating is effective to prevent the fungicide from 
migrating out of the coated packaging material but, 
surprisingly, the
