<ABSTRACT>
A water based thixotropic adhesive gel is 
disclosed which comprises: an aqueous emulsion of 

polyvinyl acetate in an amount sufficient to form 
adhesive bonds on wood; partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl 

alcohol in an amount sufficient to provide wet tack of 
the adhesive; glyoxal in an amount sufficient to 

provide water resistance to the adhesive; and wood 
flour in an amount sufficient to increase the water 

resistance imparted by the glyoxal and to provide 
sanding and staining properties to the adhesive; and 

xanthan gum in an amount sufficient to provide a 
thixotropic index and viscosity allowing extrusion of 

the gel from a flexible dispenser having a dispensing 
opening of about 0.073 inches in diameter by applying 

finger-pressure to the dispenser while, upon 
extrusion, the gel forms a bead which does not run 

when applied in a horizontal line on wood in a 
vertical plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thixotropic, water 
based, general purpose, polyvinyl acetate adhesive 
gels for wood. Many different general purpose adhesives for 
wood are available. However, such adhesives have 
various shortcomings such as excessive running when 
placed on a vertical surface, and difficulty of the 
dried adhesive: (a) to take a conventional wood stain; 
(b) to be sanded; and (c) to resist moisture. This invention provides a thixotropic adhesive 
gel which can be easily dispensed from a conventional 
hand held plastic squeeze bottle for wood glue. After 
being dispensed from the squeeze  
 
bottle, the adhesive does not run on vertical surfaces and forms a 
dry glue line which can be sanded, stained and has resistance to 
moisture. The adhesive of this invention comprises and preferably 
consists essentially of: polyvinyl acetate as the primary adhesive 
agent; xanthan gum as a thixotropic thickening agent; polyvinyl 
alcohol as a tackifying agent; and a combination of both wood flour 
and glyoxal as water resisting agents for the dried adhesive. 
Additional conventional ingredients used in adhesive compositions 
such as defoamers, preservatives, and the like can also be use 
provided that such ingredients or the quantity thereof do not 
adversely affect the adhesives. Water based polyvinyl acetate emulsions are popular wood 
glues. The Handbook of Adhesives, Third Edition which is edited by 
I. Skeist: pages 388-390 describes the use of polyvinyl alcohol for 
imparting wet tack and as a protective colloid for polyvinyl 
acetate emulsions; pages 394-395 discusses thixotropy, 
pseudoplasticity and thickening of polyvinyl acetate with various 
materials; and page 398 describes the use of foam control agents 
and biocides in such adhesives. U.S. Patent 3,442,845 of May 6, 1969 to P. Columbus et al. 
relates to polyvinyl acetate adhesives which, upon drying, are  
 
redispersible in cold or hot water. The adhesive compositions of 
the 845 patent use polyvinyl alcohol, water-soluble gums, and 
cellulose ethers as anti-coalescing agents for the polyvinyl 
acetate. Propylene glycol and other polyhydroxy compounds are 
mentioned as plasticizers for polyvinyl alcohol. U.S. Patent 4,251,400 of February 17, 1981 to P. Columbus also 
relates to a polyvinyl acetate adhesive which is redispersible in 
hot and cold water in the dried film form and which uses 
polyvinylpyrrolidone and a non-volatile, water-soluble, plasticizer 
as the anti-coalescing agent. In addition to the polyvinyl acetate
