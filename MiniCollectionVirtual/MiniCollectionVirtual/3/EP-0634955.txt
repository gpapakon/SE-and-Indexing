 DESCRIPTIONFLUE GAS CONDITIONING SYSTEMTechnical FieldThis invention relates to systems for treating boiler flue gas to improve the removal of particulate matter contained therein by electrostatic means and, more particularly, relates to a flue gas conditioning agent production systems for converting sulfur dioxide in the flue gas into sulfur trioxide to provide conditioning agent to the flue gas particulate matter prior to its passage through an electrostatic precipitator.Background ArtThe increasing demand for electrical power has forced electrical utilities to burn increasing quantities of fossil fuels such as coal; however, electric utilities also face increasing environmental standards imposed upon their operation. In order to reduce air pollutants, electrical utilities have turned to burning low-sulfur coals to fire their boiler furnaces to generate the steam needed for generating electrical power. In addition, electrical utilities generally use a flue gas treatment system to remove the majority of the particulate matter in the gas effluent. A flue gas treatment system generally comprises an electrostatic means, such as an electrostatic precipitator, and a conditioning agent source for introducing a conditioning agent into the flue gas stream to enhance the efficiency of the precipitator in removing particulate matter.The efficiency of an electrostatic precipitator in removing particulate matter from the boiler flue 

gas is partially dependent upon the electrical resistivity of the entrained particulate matter in the boiler flue gas. The entrained particulate matter expelled from a boiler fired with low-sulfur coal, i.e., coal having less than 1 percent sulfur, has been found to have a resistivity of approximately 1013 ohms/cm. It has been determined that the most efficient removal of particulate matter by electrostatic precipitation occurs when the particulate matter resistivity is approximately 108 ohms/cm. Therefore, to obtain more effective use of an electrostatic precipitator, the resistivity of the entrained particulate matter from low-sulfur content coals must be reduced. Electrical utilities have long used conditioning agents introduced into the flue gas flow upstream of the electrostatic precipitator to reduce the resistivity of the entrained particles. Various chemicals, such as water and anhydrous ammonia, sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric acid and various ammonia-bearing solutions have been used as conditioning agents.A variety of flue gas conditioning systems have been
