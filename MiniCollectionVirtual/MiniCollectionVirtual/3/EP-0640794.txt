<ABSTRACT>
A combustion method wherein fuel is mixed with an 
oxidant mixture comprising oxygen and a defined 

concentration of argon, and combusted resulting in 
reduced generation of both NOx and particulate 

pollutants. Alternatively argon is mixed with fuel and 
the resulting mixture subsequently mixed with oxidant 

for combustion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to combustion carried
out in a combustion zone such as an industrial furnace
in order to generate heat which may be used to
heat a furnace charge.Many industrial processes employ furnaces wherein
fuel and oxidant are combusted to generate heat
which is used to heat a charge within the furnace.
Among such industrial processes one can name glassmaking
wherein the charge is glassmaking materials or
molten or solid glass, steelmaking wherein the charge
is steel or iron, copper smelting wherein the charge is
raw copper and aluminum making wherein the charge
is raw aluminum.Heretofore in carrying out such combustion the oxidant
employed has been air due primarily to the lower
cost and ready availability of air for this use. As is known,
air comprises nearly 80 percent nitrogen. The use of air
as the oxidant in carrying out combustion may also result
in the generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are
considered significant pollutants. Accordingly there has
arisen a need in recent years to reduce the level of NOx
generated by industrial combustion processes.One successful method for carrying out combustion
such as industrial furnace combustion is to use pure oxygen
as the oxidant for the combustion. This eliminates
a large amount of the nitrogen molecules, that might otherwise
be available, from the combustion reaction and
thus significantly reduces the amount of NOx generated
on an equivalent heat generation basis.DE-A 2 360 873 discloses a combustion furnace,
into which fuel is provided and combusted with a mixture
of oxygen and exhaust gas or with a mixture of oxygen
and an inert gas, preferably carbon dioxide. In experiments
made to determine the most preferable composition
of said mixture, an oxygen concentration of 15 %
was found to be most preferable. As oxygen source a
high pressure oxygen bomb, a low pressure oxygen
container or an oxygen container in combination with
pressure means may be used.According to US-A-3 982 878 hydrogen contained
in a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and oxygen or air is
burned at a controlled and relatively low burning rate in
a combustor by regulating the quantitative ratio of oxygen
to hydrogen in said gaseous mixture to the stoichiometric
ratio, adding a gaseous diluent to said gaseous
mixture outside the combustor, and feeding the diluted
mixture to the combustor.One problem with combustion carried out with pure
oxygen as the oxidant is a reduction in the momentum
of the flame or combustion reaction within the industrial
furnace. Combustion
