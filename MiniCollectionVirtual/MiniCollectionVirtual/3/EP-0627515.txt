<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic exchanging 
apparatus for exchanging cops in a shuttle-type loom. More 
particularly, the invention relates to an automatic cop 
exchanging apparatus for exchanging an old cop received in a 
shuttle with weft threads for a new cop. In general, in a conventional loom employing shuttles, 
opening operations for repeatedly separating the warps into 
upper and lower groups are repeatedly performed, while 
simultaneously the shuttle incorporating therein the wefts is 
passed between the upper and lower warps in synchronism with 
the opening operation. For example, as shown in Figs. 2A and 
2B, the convention shuttle 1, which has generally a boat-like 
shape, has a recess la which receives an elongated cop 2 
around which the threads of the warp 4 are wound. A tong is 
provided in a rear portion of the recess la mounted so as to 
be rotatable through about 90Â° so as to be movable from a 
horizontal position to a vertical position. The cop 2 is 
received in a horizontal position within the recess 1a under 
the condition that the tong 3 is inserted into a hole 2a 
formed in the bottom of the cop 2. Then, the wefts 4 are 
extracted to the outside through a hole 1b formed in the 
front portion of the shuttle 1.  With this construction, the amount of weft 4 held within 
the shuttle 1 decreases as the shuttle performs its 
reciprocating motion. When the weft has been completely 
consumed, it is necessary to stop the operation of the 
machine. Therefore, in the conventional machine, when it is 
observed that the remaining amount of the weft 4 is small, 
the operator, who, for this purpose, must stand by the 
machine, must manually perform the exchange of cops. That 
is, the weft of the old cop, which has nearly been expended, 
is cut and the old cop manually removed from the shuttle 1. 
Then, a new cop is loaded into the shuttle 1, and the new and 
old threads are tied together. Generally, therefore, it is necessary that an individual 
operator be assigned to each loom during its operation since 
the cops 2 must be replaced frequently. This of course is a 
major factor in the total labor costs for operating the loom. 
Also, since looms employing high speed shuttles are 
inherently very noise, the operator may fatigue easily. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the cost of operating a 
loom while simultaneously improving the quality of the 
working environment around the loom. In the prior art, 
however, due to the complexities of the operations involved 
in handling the
