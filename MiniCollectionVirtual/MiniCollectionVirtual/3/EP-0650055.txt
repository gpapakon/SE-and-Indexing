<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is an assay of a denatured 
lipoprotein, in which the denatured site of the denatured 

lipoprotein contained in a vital sample is exposed to the 

surface of its lipoprotein particle upon the reaction of 
an antibody, which recognizes the denatured lipoprotein, 

with the vital sample containing the denatured 
lipoprotein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reliable assay of
denatured lipoproteins which are considered to involve
arteriosclerosis and present in the living body.Arteriosclerosis is known to be the main cause of
ischemic heart diseases, cerebral infarction and the like.
The mechanism causative of arteriosclerosis is reported to
form atheroma due to accumulation of smooth muscle cells,
connective tissues and a great amount of lipids
(mainly, cholesterol esters) on a vascular
subendothelium, resulting in the hypertrophy of the
arterial wall and advanced induration, which finally
brings about the hypofunction of the artery. In particular,
it is considered that the atheroma recognized in the initial
lesion of this disease is formed from foam cells produced
by the accumulation of a denatured low density
lipoprotein (LDL) into macrophages. However, the true
character of the denatured LDL which transforms the
macrophages into the foam cells in the living body is
unknown to date. However, it has recently been explicated 
that there is a possibility that two kinds of denatured
LDLs one of which is a denatured LDL formed by the
interaction between a vascular endothelial cell which is
reported to play an important role in arteriosclerosis and
LDL [Quinn, M. T., Parthasarathy, S., Fong, L. G. &
Steingerg, D., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 2995-2998
(1987)], and the other of which is an LDL modified with
malondialdehyde (MDA) known as an end metabolic product of
lipid peroxides and thromboxane A2, which also play an
important role in arteriosclerosis [Fogelman, A. M.,
Shechter, I., Seager, J., Hokom, M., Child, J. S. &
Bdwards, P. A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 2214-2218
(1980)], may deeply participate in the initial lesion of
arteriosclerosis. An assay of these denatured LDLs in the
living body has hence been regarded as important.Some methods have heretofore been reported as
methods for assaying denatured LDLs. For example, Gonen
et al., and Salmon et al. apply an EIA competition analysis
in which MDA-modified LDL coated on the plate, and an antibody
which recognizes the MDA-modified LDL are used [Gonen, B.,
Fallon, J. J. & Baker, S. A, Atherosclerosis, 65, 265-272
(1987)] and an EIA sandwich technique in which an immobilized
antibody which recognizes MDA-modified LDL and an enzyme-labeled
antibody which recognizes LDL are used [Salmon,
S., Maziere, C., Theron, L., Beucler, I., Ayrault-Jarrier,
M., Goldstein, S. & Polonovski, J., Biochim. Biophys. 
Acta, 920, 215-220 (1987)], respectively, to assay

<CLAIMS>
An assay of a denatured lipoprotein, which comprises:

exposing the denatured site of the denatured lipoprotein
contained in a biological sample to the surface of its lipoprotein

particle and
reacting an antibody, which recognizes the denatured lipoprotein,
with the biological sample containing the denatured

lipoprotein.
The assay according to Claim 1, wherein the
exposure of the denatured site of the denatured

lipoprotein to the surface of its lipoprotein particle is
performed by causing a surfactant to coexist in the

reaction system containing the biological sample and the
antibody which recognizes the denatured lipoprotein.
The assay according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the
antibody which recognizes the denatured lipoprotein is an

anti-malondialdehyde-modified lipoprotein antibody.
The assay according to Claim 2, wherein the
surfactant is an anionic surfactant.
The assay according to Claim 4, wherein the
anionic surfactant is an alkylsulfate. 
The assay according to any one of Claims 1-5,
wherein the denatured lipoprotein is selected from the

group consisting of denatured low density lipoprotein,
denatured lipoprotein (a) and denatured high density

lipoprotein.
