Czochralski silicon crystal pullers in which silicon is melted in a quartz 

crucible. The apparatus incudes a susceptor 10, a quartz crucible 12 in said 
susceptor, a cable 16 for lowering a seed crystal 14 into silicon melted in said 

crucible, and a combination spiral heater/magnetic coil 25 for heating and 
melting silicon in said crucible, and for producing a magnetic field around 

the crucible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor materials, and more particularly to 
a spiral magnetic coil and heater for suppression of SiO generation and 
control of oxygen and impurity profile in Czochralski silicon crystal 
growing apparatus. In Czochralski silicon crystal pullers, the silicon monoxide (SiO) 
generation from the reaction between molten silicon (Si) and quartz crucible 
(SiO2) starts at about 1150°C. At this temperature SiO constitutes the major 
volatile component, besides inert gas. The vapor pressure of SiO at 1150°C. is 0.05 millimeters of mercury. 
The SiO vapors condense on the cooler parts of the crystal puller and they 
also react with hot graphite (the heater) leading to carbon monoxide (CO) 
generation. Carbon monoxide is the major precursor for carbon contribution 
in the finished silicon crystal. The suppression of SiO generation is important for reduction of both 
oxygen and carbon in silicon crystals. Conventional Czochralski crystal furnaces have been equipped with an 
external magnet field. This magnetic field imparts unique properties to 
semiconductor materials, one of which is to reduce the oxygen content of the 
crystal. Conventional magnetic Czochralski crystal furnaces require an 
expensive external power supply and magnet to provide the magnetic field. 
Operation and maintenance of this equipment is expensive and cost 
prohibitive for most applications.  The invention is to provide a method and apparatus for the 
suppression of silicon monoxide generation and control of the oxygen content 
of crystal growth in a Czochralski crystal puller. A spiral heater/magnetic 
coil combination is placed around the crucible in the furnace to provide both 
the heat required in crystal pulling and the magnetic field used to reduce 
oxygen content of the molten silicon. The current used to heat the furnace is 
also used to provide the magnetic field in the crystal puller. This feature 
reduces the cost of operation and maintenance of the magnetic Czochralski 
crystal furnace and the material grown from such a furnace provides a cost 
competitive material while providing desirable characteristics in the pulled 
crystal. The method for control of oxygen content in silicon crystals formed in a 
Czochralski crystal puller includes the application of the current through the 
spiral coil heater, and maintaining the current in an amount to properly heat 
and melt the silicon, and to provide the desired magnetic field around the 
molten silicon during the crystal pulling procedure. An
