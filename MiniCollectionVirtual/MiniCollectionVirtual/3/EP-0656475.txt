<ABSTRACT>
The fuel injector with needle position sensor has a Hall sensor (32) and a permanent magnet (31) moved together with the valve needle (17). The permanent magnet (31) is fixed to the end of an extension (26) of a pressure spindle (19), moved with the valve needle (17), and is guided so that it slides in a guide bushing (24) arranged at the end (22) of the spring chamber (21), which bushing is composed of a non-magnetisable material. The Hall sensor (32) bears on the guide bushing (24) and is fixed to a conductor cable (35), the end section (39) of which with an enclosing stopper (37) is tightly and immovably arranged in an inclined bore (36).

Fuel injection nozzle with needle-position
sensing device for internal combustion engines, with a

valve member (17) displaceable between a closed position
and an open position in a nozzle body (11), with a

helical compression spring (18) loading the valve member
in the closing direction, with a housing (15) which

carries the nozzle body and in which a chamber is
arranged for receiving the helical compression spring,

the helical compression spring being supported via an
intermediate member (24) on that end of the said chamber

which is located opposite the nozzle body, with, in the
chamber, a magnet (31) on an extension moved together

with the valve needle, and with a Hall sensor (32) which
is assi
gned fixedly to the movable magnet and which is
fastened to a conductor cable (35) which passes through

a passage (36) in the housing extending from the outside
to the said end of the chamber, characterized in that the

intermediate member supporting the helical compression
spring (18) is designed as a guide bush (24), in the bore

(25) of which the extension (26) together with the magnet
(31) fastened thereon is guided displaceably and in which

the magnet (31) moves during the stroke of the valve
needle (17), and in that the Hall sensor (32) is arranged

in that end portion of the passage (36) adjacent to the
chamber (21) and bears with its sensor side on the end

face (34) of the guide bush (24) which bears on the said
end (22) of the chamber (21).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the passage runs obliquely in the 

form of a bore (36) from the circumferential surface of
the housing (15) to the end (22) of the chamber (21), and

in that the entrance of the bore (36) is widened by means
of a groove-like clearance (42).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the portion (39) of the cable (35)

which adjoins the Hall sensor (32) is surrounded by a
plug (37) seated tightly in the bore (36).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the plug (37) is secured in the

clearance (42) by a clamping means (41).
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of Claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the extension (26) carrying

the magnet (31) passes through the entire length of the
cavity surrounding the helical compression spring (18).
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of Claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the guide bush (24) for the

magnet (31) consists of a non-magnetizable material.
