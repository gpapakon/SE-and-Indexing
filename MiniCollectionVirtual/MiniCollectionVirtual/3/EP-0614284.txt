<ABSTRACT>
A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) (20) includes a data 
converter (21) which is susceptible to idling noise. Idling occurs 

when the DAC (20) receives an idle pattern, which is a digital input 
signal which corresponds to a analog zero level. The DAC (20) 

provides an output of the data converter (21) as an output signal 
while receiving a non-idle input pattern. After the DAC (20) 

continuously detects the idle pattern for a first predetermined 
time period, the DAC (20) provides the analog zero level as the 

output signal. A second predetermined time after the idle pattern 
disappears, the DAC (20) again provides the output of the data 

converter (21) as the output signal. The first predetermined time 
preferably corresponds to a propagation delay through the data 

converter (21), while the second predetermined time period 
corresponds to one-half the propagation delay through the data 

converter (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to signal processing, and 
more particularly, to digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Data converters, including digital-to-analog converters 
(DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), have become 
important due to the popularity of digital recording devices. For 
example, a compact disc (CD) player optically reads audio 
information stored on a CD, and provides this digital signal to an 
input of a DAC, which converts the digital signal to an analog 
signal. Because digital technology is used, the sound reproduction 
is nearly flawless: modern DACs, such as those based on the sigma-delta 
technique, are able to recover the signal without introducing 
significant amounts of noise or distortion. There are two basic techniques used in DACs, the sigma-delta 
technique and the resistive or capacitive divider technique. The 
sigma-delta technique is attractive because it achieves high 
resolution by precise timing instead of precisely-matched on-chip 
components such as resistors. In addition, the expertise needed to 
produce thin-film, laser-trimmed analog components is difficult to 
obtain; whereas, high-speed digital switching capability is 
commonplace in the semiconductor industry. A basic sigma-delta DAC receives a digital input signal 
which is summed with inverse feedback of the output signal to 
provide an error signal. The error signal is then processed through 
an integrator and a comparator to provide the analog output signal. 
The sigma-delta DAC is able to shape the quantization noise out of 
the audio signal range, and any noise beyond that range is 
imperceptible to the listener in an ideal implementation. The 
output of an ideal sigma-delta modulator can thus be used as the 
DAC analog output signal. However, added filtering is required for  
 
non-ideal following amplifier stages because the out-of-band 
noise tends to intermodulate back into the passband. Sigma-delta 
modulators also often require oversampled data which would be 
provided by an interpolator. Sigma-delta DACs, however, do suffer from inherent 
drawbacks which make them less suitable for audio applications. 
For example, known sigma-delta DACs suffer from idling noise. 
That is, during periods in which the digital input corresponds to an 
analog zero output, the sigma-delta DAC provides a non-zero analog 
output signal. For example, a CD has gaps or silent periods 
between different tracks. During the silent period, the digital code 
represents an analog zero level. However, the
