<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS OF TREATING OBESITY WITH PURINE RELATED COMPOUNDSField of the InventionThe present invention pertains to a method of treating obesity in warm-blooded animals, including humans, and to methods of increasing the ratio of muscle mass to fat in farm animals.Background of the InventionU.S. Patent No. 4,879,296, issued November 7, 1989 and U.S. Patent No. 4,981,857, issued January 1, 1991, disclose purine derivatives of Formula I described below, which are useful in the present invention.Methods of preparing the compounds are disclosed in both U.S. 4,879,296 and 4,981,857. The patents also disclose that the compounds provided therein are useful in human and veterinary therapy, particularly for conditions associated with the cell surface effects of adenosine. Even so, there is no disclosure in either U.S. patent that the compounds provided therein are useful as anti- obesity agents, or as agents capable of increasing the ratio to muscle mass to fat in farm animals. Instead, both patents are concerned with using the compounds disclosed therein in the treatment or prophylaxis of AIDS and other retroviral infections and for pathophysiological disorders arising from the cell surface effects' of adenosine. Such pathophysiological disorders caused by adenosine/cell surface interaction are disclosed in both U.S. patents as including those arising within the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal or neuroendocrine systems, including heart block, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. U.S. Patents 4,879,269 and 4,981,857 are each incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method of treating obesity in warm-blooded animals. In particular, the 

present invention provides a method of treating obesity (e.g., adult onset obesity, lifelong obesity and morbid obesity7) in humans. The method entails administering to a patient in need thereof, an effective amount of one of the anti-obesity agents encompassed by Formula I, as shown below. Such compounds are advantageously administered to a patient in need thereof in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Additionally, the compounds of Formula I can be used as an aide in treating a Type II diabetes condition in an obese patient. For example, many accepted treatments for Type II diabetic conditions often include weight reduction in an affected obese patient. Type II diabetes as used herein means non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.The present
