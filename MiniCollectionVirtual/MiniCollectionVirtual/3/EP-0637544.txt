<ABSTRACT>
A tension limiting strap tool for tightening a cable 
tie around a bundle of wires or the like. The strap tool 

includes a pair of pivotally connected handles (12,14), one of the 
handles having a cam surface (36) that cooperates with a 

flexible barb member (34,40) to hold an end of the cable tie strap 
as the handles are pivoted towards each other. One of the 

handles also includes at least one abutment surface (28) that 
pushes away the cable tie head from the held strap end, 

and thus tightens the cable tie around the bundle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a strap tensioning 
and cutting tool, and more particularly to a simple cable 
tie tensioning tool that includes a spring for limiting 
the tensioning action of the tool. In applications using cable ties and the like, it is 
important to make sure that the cable ties are properly 
fastened around the bundle. Since it is usually difficult 
and inefficient for the user to simply use his hands for 
tightening the cable tie, strap tensioning tools are used 
(see e.g. DE-A-2 824 071, which discloses a tool in accordance with 
the preamble of claim 1). 
A major problem with most current cable tie strap 
tensioning tools is that they are complicated hand tools 
which require a great deal of time, effort, and skill to 
manufacture and are often difficult to operate. They 
often include numerous pivoting, bending and sliding 
members that are not only more difficult to manufacture 
but can also lead to a higher occurrence of breakdowns or 
defects of the tools during use. Additionally, while the 
cable tie must be sufficiently tightened to properly 
secure the bundle, overtightening can also cause 
difficulties such as strap failure or other damage. 
Therefore, it is important to have a simple device that 
can easily tighten the cable tie tightly around a bundle 
of wires without over-tightening the strap. It is also 
frequently desirable to be able to selectively cut off the 
excess strap from a tightened cable tie using the 
tightening tool. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a cable tie strap tensioning tool having reduced 
complexity.  
 It is another object of the present invention to provide 
a simple cable tie tensioning and cutting tool having 
the ability to automatically stop tightening upon reaching 
a desired tension. It is yet another object of the present invention to 
provide a simple cable tie strap tensioning tool that 
tightens the strap around a bundle by holding the strap 
end in a fixed position while pushing the cable tie head 
along the strap in a tightening direction. These and other objects, together with the advantages 
thereof over existing prior art forms, which will become 
apparent from the following specification are accomplished 
by means of the strap tensioning tool as defined in 
the appended claims. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a strap tensioning 
tool engaged with a cable tie strap embodying the concept 
of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the strap tensioning 
tool of FIG. 1 in the actuated
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A strap tensioning tool (10) for tightening a cable tie having a strap (44) and a 
locking head (46) around a bundle (54) comprising a bottom handle (14) and a top 

handle (12) pivotally attached at a front end to a front end of the bottom handle, a 
passageway (56) formed between the top and bottom handles at the front end, 

disposed to accept and position a strap end (42) of the cable tie that has been inserted 
through the cable tie locking head (46), 

a flexible return 
member (34) engaged and situated between the top and bottom handles so as to bias 

them apart, 
pushing means integral with the top handle (12) including at least one pusher surface 

(28) located at the front end of the top handle (12) that pushes the locking head (46) 
of the cable tie away from the held strap end as the top handle (12) rotates towards the 

bottom handle (14),
characterized
 in that
 
it includes a cam surface (36) integral with the top handle (12) and disposed so as to be 

facing the bottom handle (14), and 
barb means (40) disposed on the flexible return member (34) adjacent the 

cam surface (36), the cam surface (36) forcing the barb means (40) into engagement with the 
strap end by pressing against the bottom handle (14) as the 

top handle (12) and the bottom handle (14) rotate towards each other, thereby 
preventing the strap end from movement. 
A strap tensioning tool according to claim 1, wherein the strap gripping barb 
means comprises at least one barb (40) formed on the handle return member (34). 
A strap tensioning tool according to claim 1 or 2, further including means for 
automatically limiting the tightening of the cable tie around the bundle (54) to prevent 

overtightening.  
 
A strap tensioning tool in accordance with claim 3, wherein the tension limiting 
means includes a tension limiting spring (48) attached at one end to the flexible return 

member (34) and at the other end to the bottom handle (14). 
A strap tensioning tool according to one of the claims 1 to 4, further comprising 
cutting means for cutting off the excess strap end at a point near the cable tie head 

(46) after tightening. 
A strap tensioning tool according to claim 5, wherein the cutting means 
includes a cutter blade (52) having a strap receiving slot. 
A strap tensioning tool according to one of the claims 1 to 6 wherein the 
bottom handle (14) is generally channel-shaped. 
A strap tensioning tool according to claim 7, wherein the bottom handle (14) 
further includes a strap exit passageway. 
A strap tensioning tool according to claim 6, wherein the cutter blade (52) is 
selectively attachable to the top handle (12) at a point near the pusher surface (12). 
A strap tensioning tool according to claim 9, wherein the cutter blade (52) is 
movable so that it is selectively engageable with the strap end as the strap end is 

inserted into the passageway between the top and bottom handles (12, 14).
