<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of clinical 
chemistry. More particularly, the present invention relates to a lithium 
reagent composition and method for determining lithium present in a 
biological specimen. The quantitative determination of lithium in clinical samples is 
currently typically performed by flame photometry or by ion selective 
electrodes (ISE). While use of a flame photometer for monitoring lithium 
levels is rather costly and cumbersome, the ISE method suffers mainly from 
interferences from sodium and other ions present in biological fluids. A number of attempts have been made to design a colorimetric 
lithium assay based on lithium selective chromoionophores (Pacey et al, 
Synth. Commun. 11, 1981, 323-328; Kaneda et al., Tetrahedron Letters 22, 
1981, 4407-4408; Ogawa et al., J. Amer. Chem. 106, 1984, 5760-5762; 
Sasaki et al., Anal. Chim. Acta. 174, 1985, 141-149; Misumi et al., J. Amer. 
Chem. Soc. 107, 1985, 4802-4803; Kimura et al., J. Org. Chem. 52, 1987, 
836-844; Attiyat et al., 37, 1988, 114-121; Cram et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 
110, 1988, 571-577). The various lithium selective compounds described in the prior art 
cited above lack adequate lithium binding in aqueous media and require  
 
extraction-photometric procedures that are difficult to automate. The 
relatively low level of lithium in serum (0.5-1.5 mM) imposes very high 
constraints on selectivity over the high normal serum sodium concentration 
(135-150 mM). Ideally, the selectivity for lithium over sodium should be 
1,500:1 in order to essentially eliminate any sodium interference. The first practical colorimetric lithium assay, which uses a 
chromogenic cryptand ionophore was described by Chapoteau et al. in Clin. 
Chem. 38, 1992, 1654-1657 and Czech et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,187,103. 
Recently, Sutherland et al. reported in J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 
1992 1716-1718 a new chromogenic cryptand for the determination of 
lithium in an extraction system and its potential application in optical fiber 
sensors. The present invention is directed toward a reagent composition and 
process for the colorimetric determination of lithium in aqueous clinical 
samples. The reagent composition is based on the chromogenic cryptand 
I. 
Unlike the chromogenic cryptand described by Chapoteau and Czech, 
chromoionophore I, as disclosed by Sutherland et al., is not totally selective 
for lithium over sodium. According to the present invention a sodium salt at a concentration 
less than 2 x 10⁻² M; a base to
