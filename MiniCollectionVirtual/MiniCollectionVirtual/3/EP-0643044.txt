<ABSTRACT>
A novel bis-biguanide compound suitable for use as a 
disinfectant has the following formula: 


   where n is an integer from 2 to 10 inclusive. A 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly gluconate salt 

of the compound is also useful as a disinfectant. The bis-biguanide 

compound has germicidal activities comparable to 
those of widely used chlorhexidine with respect to width of 

antibacterial spectrum and is superior to chlorhexidine in 
immediate effectiveness. It exhibits excellent germicidal 

activities against Pyocyaneus bacilli, on which chlorhexidine 
has poor effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel bis-biguanide 
compound having germicidal activity and a disinfectant 
composition containing the same. Chlorhexidine having the formula 
 
is a bis-biguanide compound developed in 1954 as a 
disinfectant. This compound exhibits disinfecting or 
germicidal activities on a wide range of general bacteria and 
is widely used because of its quick effect and low toxicity. 
Especially, it is used as a gluconate salt, which has high 
solubility in water, for disinfection of hands and fingers in 
hospitals, body skin to be operated on, and medical 
instruments, particularly surgical instruments. However, chlorhexidine has a defect that it is less 
effective against some Gram-negative bacteria, especially 
Pyocyaneus bacilli, typical of which is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Furthermore, recently Pyocyaneus bacillus strains and 
Pseudomonas cepacia strains, which are resistant to this 
disinfectant, have been reported to be a problem in medical 
institutions. Chlorhexidine sometimes causes shock symptoms 
when it is administered to mucous membranes in a conventional 
concentration. Therefore, administration thereof to mucous 
membranes other than conjunctivae is now prohibited. Under these circumstances, a substitute for chlorhexidine 
which retains the wide antibacterial spectrum of chlorhexidine 
and possesses germicidal effect and medial applicability 
superior to that of chlorhexidine has been sought. Thus, there 
is a demand for a novel chlorhexidine-type disinfectant for 
medical use which can be used in a concentration low enough to 
be safely applicable to mucous membranes, has improved  
 
germicidal activity especially against Pyocyaneus bacillus 
strains, against which chlorhexidine is no longer effective, 
and is suitable for use as a topical disinfectant for surgical 
operations. It has been found that a compound having the same chemical 
formula as chlorhexidine except that the chlorine substituent 
on each benzene ring is replaced by a trifluoromethoxy group 
has improved germicidal activities, and that its activities are 
particularly high against Pyocyaneus bacilli. The present invention provides a novel bis-biguanide 
compound of the following formula: 
 
where n is an integer from 2 to 10 inclusive, and a salt 
thereof. Preferably, n is an integer from 3 to 8 inclusive and 
most preferably it is 6. In another aspect, the present invention provides a 
disinfectant composition comprising a bis-biguanide compound of 
the above formula (I) or a pharmaceutically
