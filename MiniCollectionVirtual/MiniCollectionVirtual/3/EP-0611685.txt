<ABSTRACT>
An occupant restraint air bag assembly (10) 
includes an air bag (22) having a base wall portion 

communicating with an inflator (16) and an 
occupant contacting face wall (32) for contact with 

the occupant (14) upon inflation of the bag. The air 
bag (22) also has an internal dividing wall (30) which 

divides the air bag (22) into a first chamber (26) 
communicating directly with the inflator (16) and a 

second chamber (28) defined between the dividing wall 
(30) and the occupant contacting face wall (32). A 

first opening (36) in the dividing wall (32) between 
the chambers (26,28) communicates inflation gas from 

the first chamber (26) to the second chamber (28) to 
inflate the second chamber (28). A second opening 

(38) in the dividing wall (30) is normally closed by a 
vent flap (44) which is operably connected to the 

occupant contacting face wall (32) so that the 
inflation of the second chamber (28) and resultant 

travel of the face wall (32) towards the occupant (14) 
and away from the dividing wall (30) will move the 

valve flap (44) to an open position by which the 
inflation gas is communicated into the second chamber 

(28) through both the first opening (36) and the 
second opening (38) during the further inflation of 

the bag (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an occupant 
restraint air bag which includes two chambers with a 
valve communicating inflation gas between the 
chambers. It is well known to provide an inflatable 
air bag for restraining a vehicle occupant. The air 
bag assembly includes a folded bag which is connected 
to a source of inflation gas. Release of the 
inflation gas into the air bag causes the bag to 
expand rapidly so that a face wall of the air bag is 
displaced towards contact with the occupant. It is 
known to provide such air bags having internal walls 
which divide the air bag into various chambers and to 
provide openings in the walls to communicate inflation 
gas between the chambers. Various arrangements of 
check valves and pressure relief valves have been 
proposed for selectively opening and closing the 
opening to control the communication of inflation gas 
between the chambers. US-A-3586347 describes a system 
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. 
DE-A-3618060 describes an air bag system having a 
release vent opened by a cord. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved air bag. An occupant restraint air bag in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised over 
US-A-3586347 by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1. The degree of opening and closing of the 
second opening between the air bag chambers is 
dependant upon the displacement of the air bag towards 
the fully deployed position. Preferably, there is provided an air bag 
assembly which includes an air bag having a base wall 
portion communicating with an inflator providing  
 
inflation gas and an occupant contacting face wall for 
contacting the occupant upon inflation of the bag. 
The air bag preferably has an internal dividing wall 
which divides the air bag into a first chamber  
 
communicating directly with the inflator and a second 
chamber defined between the dividing wall and the 
occupant contacting face wall. A first opening in the 
dividing wall between the chambers can permit the 
controlled communication of inflation gas from the 
first chamber to the second chamber to inflate the 
second chamber. A second opening in the dividing wall 
is preferably normally closed by a vent flap which is 
operably connected to the occupant contacting face 
wall so that the inflation of the second chamber and 
resultant travel of the face wall towards the occupant 
and away from the dividing wall will move the valve 
flap to an open position by which the inflation gas is 
communicated
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An occupant restraint air bag comprising 
an inflator (16) for generating inflation gas; an air 

bag (22) including a first chamber (26) coupled 
directly with the inflator and a second chamber (28) 

defined by an occupant contacting face wall (32,76) 
and separated from the first chamber by a dividing 

wall (30,62), at least one first opening (36,64) in 
the dividing wall between the first and second 

chambers to permit controlled passage of inflation gas 
from the first chamber to the second chamber, and a 

second opening (38,66) in the dividing wall between 
the chambers,characterised by closure means (44,74) 

normally closing the second opening to passage of 
inflation gas from the first chamber to the second 

chamber, and by actuating means (54) located within 
the second chamber and including a first end operably 

associated with the closure means and a second end 
attached to occupant contacting facing wall of the air 

bag so that the inflation of the second chamber and 
resulting displacement of the occupant contacting face 

wall opens the closure means when the occupant 
contacting face wall has moved by a predetermined 

amount. 
An occupant restraint air bag according 
to claim 1, comprising a tether (34) attached to the 

dividing wall (30,62) for limiting displacement of the 
dividing wall. 
An occupant restraint air bag according 
to any preceding claim, comprising a mesh screen 

(40,68) extending across the second opening (38,66). 
An occupant restraint air bag according 
to claim 3, wherein the closure means (74) passes 

through a gap (70) between the second opening (66) and 
the mesh screen (68).  

 
An occupant restraint air bag according 
to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the closure means 

(44) passes through the first opening (36). 
An occupant restraint air bag according 
to any preceding claim, comprising an inner bag, the 

dividing wall (30) forming part of the inner bag, the 
first chamber (26) being bounded by the inner bag. 
An occupant restraint air bag according 
to any preceding claim, comprising a plurality of 

first openings (64).
