<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for treating (in particular excess) sewage sludge, by, in particular, biodegradable surfactants, an amount of surfactant based on the biomass being essentially homogeneously admixed to a given amount of sewage sludge with simultaneous, essentially uniformly distributed introduction of oxygen, which amount of surfactant is enough to lead to at least a 50% reduction in dry matter by lysis of the amount of sewage sludge used.

A process for the treatment of sewage sludge
separated in a sewage works by addition of surfactants,

particularly biologically degradable surfactants,
characterised in that in a first stage (17.1) of the

process, an amount of surfactant depending on the
biomass and up to 200 mg surfactants per kg of dry mass

of sludge is homogeneously mixed with a preset amount
of sewage sludge with simultaneous, substantially

uniformly distributed introduction of oxygen, the
amount of surfactants being such as to result in lysis

of a proportion, preferably 50%, of the living
microorganisms in the amount of sludge used, and in

that in at least one further stage (17.2) a quantity of
surfactant depending on the biomass and up to 200 mg of

surfactants per kg of dry mass in the sludge is
homogeneously mixed with the product from the previous

stage in the process with simultaneous, substantially
uniformly distributed introduction of oxygen, the

amount being sufficient to result in lysis of a
proportion, preferably 50%, of the living

microorganisms in the amount of sludge present in the
further stage.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that mixing is brought about by application of shearing

forces.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that when the sewage sludge has been substantially

completely lysed, the lysate is fed to an additional
treatment stage where it is mixed with fresh sewage

sludge or is extracted and supplied for a different 
use, particularly as a fertiliser (liquid animal feed)

or digested sludge for gas production.
A process according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that in the case of multistage

treatment, the end-product from a previous stage
(e.g. 17.1) is transferred to the next stage (17.2) and

in the said next stage (17.2) a second amount of sludge
is added thereto and is substantially at least as large

as the amount of the lysed portion in the end product
from the previous stage (17.1) and in that an amount of

surfactant depending on the biomass is substantially
homogeneously mixed, with simultaneous, substantially

uniformly distributed introduction of oxygen, with the
contents of the said next stage (17.2) consisting of

the end product from the previous stage (17.1) and the
second amount of sludge, the amount resulting in at

least 50% reduction of dry mass by lysis of the amount
of not (yet) lysed sludge input into the said next

stage (17.2).
A process according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the surfactants

are added to the sludge in time intervals, i.e. are
metered in respe
ct of time.
A process according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the liquid

separated from a lysing stage (17) is fed to a
digestion stage.
A process according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the sludge

withdrawn from a lysing stage (17) is returned to a 
biological purification stage (9) or a bio.-P. stage

(44) preceding the biological purification stage (9).
A process according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the sludge

separated from the n
th
 lysing stage (17.n) after lysis
therein is dewatered and dumped if required.
