<ABSTRACT>
A shape memory alloy pipe coupling in the present invention 
for joining two pipes (1), the pipe coupling comprising a tube (2) of a 

shape memory alloy, and a cover (3) of stainless steel having a 
sufficient thickness and having high corrosion resistance for 

covering the tube. The shape memory alloy is enclosed by the 
cover of high corrosion-resistant stainless steel, by which high-temperature 

water can be prevented from making the shape memory 
alloy brittle and from corroding and damaging the shape memory 

alloy particularly through galvanic corrosion even in the case 
where such high-temperature water exists in the inside or outside 

of the pipes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shape memory alloy pipe
coupling according to claim 1 and being adapted to pipe joining under water and particularly to
a high corrosion-resistant shape memory alloy pipe coupling
suitable as a pipe coupling used in a position where welding is
hardly carried out.In the case where pipes are joined, welding is generally
used. In the case of welding, however, not only a large space
is required for a welding apparatus and for a worker but also a
large time is required for welding work. In the case of a pipe
coupling using a shape memory alloy, however, not only the
required space is reduced but also the time required for pipe
joining is shortened, compared with the case of welding. A Ti-Ni
alloy is widely used as a shape memory alloy for such a pipe
coupling, because the Ti-Ni alloy is excellent in shape recovery
capability. The Ti-Ni alloy may be however inferior to stainless
steel in corrosion resistance under water.As a conventional technique with respect to such a shape
memory alloy pipe coupling, a pipe coupling for joining high-temperature
water pipes in an atomic power plant is described in
a paper by Hiroshi Horikawa, Yuichi Suzuki, Akira Horie, Shinji
Yamamoto and Yuji Yasuda in Furukawa Denko Review, No. 88, pp.
23-28, June 1991. In the pipe coupling, a structure in which a
stainless steel tube is disposed between a shape memory alloy and 
a water pipe is employed in order to prevent water from leaking
through a pipe joint into the shape memory alloy. The pipe
coupling is however applied only to the case where water flows
in the inside of the pipes.On the other hand, JP-A 1-192543 discloses an anticorrosion
shape memory alloy for repairing local cracking in a heat-transfer
pipe for heat exchanger. In the JP-A 1-192543, use of
the shape memory alloy under water is considered but the shape
memory alloy is of the type in which a sleeve of an anticorrosion
shape memory alloy is inserted in the inside of the pipe. JP-A
4-300495 discloses an Ni-P alloy or Cu alloy coating which is
formed on a pipe coupling of a shape memory alloy by electroless
plating for the purpose of preventing peeling or cracking even
at the time of shrinking of the shape memory alloy by heating.Each of U.S. Patents 4,310,183 and 4,314,718 discloses the
case where a cover is provided. In the U.S. Patents 4,310,183
and 4,314,718, however, not only the material for the cover is
not clear but also the cover is provided not integrally.Among those conventional techniques, the technique described
in
