<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for handling small pots (2) for plants or cuttings, which pots (2) are provided with a paper sleeve and from which water is removed by squeezing and which are then fed to a carrier web (1) consisting of a nonwoven made of paper and decomposing under the influence of moisture, on which carrier web they are attached at a distance from each other selected to suit the intended purpose.

<CLAIMS>
A method for handling plant or cutting pots having a 
paper jacket and drained by compression, characterized in 

that the paper jackets of the plant or cutting pots (2), 
which jackets decompose in moisture, are supplied to a 

carrier surface (1) consisting of a hygroscopic paper mat 
decomposing without residue in moisture, to which carrier 

surface (1) they are fixed, at distances appropriate to the 
application, with a heat-activatable adhesive which 

decomposes without residue in moisture. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that, 
in the area of the point where the plant or cutting pots (2) 

are fed to the carrier surface (1), said carrier surface (1) 
is heated and the adhesive layer is thus activated. 
A device for handling plant or cutting pots having a 
paper jacket, characterized by a carrier surface (1) 

consisting of a hygroscopic paper mat decomposing without 
residue in moisture, to which carrier surface (1) the plant 

or cutting pots (2) having a paper jacket decomposing in 
moisture are fixed, at distances appropriate to the 

application, by means of an adhesive which decomposes without 
residue in moisture.
