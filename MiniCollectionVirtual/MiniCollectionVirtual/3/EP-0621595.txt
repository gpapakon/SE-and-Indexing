<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive in a multi-disk storage system has a 
spindle synchronizer and a spindle controller that are 

microprocessor-based. The spindle synchronizer has a counter 
used to track the phase of a master phase reference signal 

that is distributed to all the disk drives in the storage 
system. The counter may also optionally be used to generate 

the master reference signal. The spindle synchronizer also 
has programmable registers and a comparator that are used to 

generate a spindle reference signal having a programmable 

phase offset relative to the master reference signal, and a 
register used to sample the phase of the master reference 

once per revolution of its associated spindle. The spindle 
controller contains a counter used to measure the actual 

rotational period of the associated spindle. The spindle 
phase error is used in a phase correction algorithm that 

controls a reference voltage supplied to a motor spin 
controller. The algorithm employs frequency switching to 

phase-lock the associated spindle with the spindle reference 
signal generated by the spindle synchronizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of disk drives for
data processing systems, and in particular to the
synchronization and phase locking of multiple disk drive
spindles.Data storage systems often utilize several storage
devices such as hard magnetic disk drives to provide adequate
permanent data storage capacity. Each hard disk drive
incorporates a multiple-disk stack mounted on a spindle and
driven by a motor operated at a predetermined rotational
speed; this arrangement is commonly referred to as a spindle-disk
assembly or SDA. Data transfer to and from each disk
drive is effected by means of a plurality of read/write
transducers, such as magnetic read/write heads, each one of
which is associated with a disk surface and is mounted on a
common actuator mechanism. Each disk drive also typically
has an associated spindle motor speed control circuit to
maintain the rotational speed of the SDA within predetermined
limits. 3600 RPM is a common rotational speed, but the trend 
is toward higher RPMs in order to increase the rate at which
data can be read from or written to the disk drive.When a number of independent disk drives are employed in
a storage system, it is advantageous to synchronize their
operation. In particular, it is advantageous to have precise
phase alignment between disks in different drives in order to
minimize unnecessary delays when switching from a disk in one
drive a disk in another. This need for synchronism requires
a higher degree of rotational control than is achieved by a
set of independent speed controllers.One known technique for achieving synchronous operation
is to phase-lock the rotation of each disk drive to a single
master reference signal. For example, it is possible to
phase-lock a feedback signal indicative of spindle position
to the master reference signal, and thereby phase-lock the
spindle to the master reference signal. Such a scheme
without further modification has only coarse phase-alignment
resolution, because generally the feedback signal only
indicates spindle position to the nearest rotor pole. Also,
it still requires some way of aligning the information on the
disk with the spindle, so that phase-aligning the spindles
results in phase-aligned disks. This requirement burdens the
manufacturing step of "servowriting", i.e., writing servo-mechanism-related
information to the disk, in at least two
ways: 1) the servowriter must somehow track the spindle motor
rotation to ensure that the position information is aligned
with the spindle; and 2) the servowriter and
