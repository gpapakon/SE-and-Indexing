<ABSTRACT>
In a tread profile for winter tyres of motor vehicles, in particular for motor vehicles of the transporter class, having at least two grooves running in the circumferential direction and transversely running grooves for bounding profile blocks, in order to increase the capacity to cope with winter conditions with simultaneous optimised lateral stability there is provision according to the invention for the transverse grooves (5) to extend in a helix-like manner with an approximately Z-shaped bend (6) in the centre of the tread width, and for at least four longitudinal grooves (1, 2, 3; 4) which run in the circumferential direction to be provided, the individual sections of which longitudinal grooves (1, 2, 3; 4) are offset with respect to one another between two transverse grooves (5) alternately to the left and to the right in each case by at least one half groove width.
