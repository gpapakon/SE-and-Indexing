<ABSTRACT>
The panes (10,12) are arranged in a predetermined alignment position opposite one another, first of all aligned in a V-shaped position with respect to one another and are then pivoted into a parallel position. A gas-filling device (30) is fitted onto the underside of the panes. In this arrangement, there is formed between the panes (10,12) a space, whose width is set such that a gap (16) of an essentially uniform width remains, around the periphery, between the spacer frame (14) and the pane (10) located opposite this. Both on the front side and rear side, in the transporting direction, in each case one seal (52) for gas-tight termination is arranged on the side edges of the panes, whereupon a filling gas is channelled into the space between the panes (10,12) by means of the gas-filling device (30), the air being displaced out of the space through the gap section on the upper side of the pane arrangement. Thereafter, the panes (10,12) are moved towards one another, the peripheral gap (16) being closed and the panes being pressed together.

speed, and after a chronological delay are moved towards each 

other in their top region also, at a second speed which is 
higher than the first speed, however. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that filling with filling gas is effected 

over the entire underside of the single pane(s) and/or pane 
arrangement(s). 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the longitudinal extent of the gap 

section on the underside of the single pane(s) and/or pane 
arrangement(s) is centred with respect to a nozzle arrangement

claim 1, having two movable press platens (20, 22) on each of 

which a single pane/pane arrangement (10, 12) is to be held by 
reduced pressure, and having a gas filling
 device (30; 301, 
302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309) for feeding gas into a
