<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed of producing a dye 
image in an imagewise exposed color photographic 

element by developing a silver halide emulsion to 
produce silver imagewise and employing the developed 

silver to catalyze the reaction of an oxidizing agent 
and a reducing agent that are inert to oxidation-reduction 

interaction in the absence of developed 
silver, and reacting oxidized reducing agent with a dye 

image providing compound to form the dye image. In the 
color photographic element total silver is limited and 

the emulsion contains a high chloride {100} tabular 
grain population.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed color photographic
elements containing silver halide emulsions and to
processes for producing dye images.Radiation sensitive silver halide emulsions
containing one or a combination of chloride, bromide
and iodide ions have been long recognized to be
useful in photography. Each halide ion selection is
known to impart particular photographic advantages.
By a wide margin the most commonly employed
photographic emulsions are silver bromide and
bromoiodide emulsions. Although known and used for
many years for selected photographic applications,
the more rapid developability and the ecological
advantages of high chloride emulsions have provided
an impetus for employing these emulsions over a
broader range of photographic applications. As
employed herein the term "high chloride emulsion"
refers to a silver halide emulsion containing at
least 50 mole percent chloride, based on total
silver. The most ecologically attractive high
chloride emulsions are those that contain very low
levels of iodide ion.During the 1980's a marked advance took
place in silver halide photography based on the
discovery that a wide range of photographic
advantages, such as improved speed-granularity
relationships, increased covering power both on an
absolute basis and as a function of binder hardening,
more rapid developability, increased thermal
stability, increased separation of native and
spectral sensitization imparted imaging speeds, and
improved image sharpness in both mono- and multi-emulsion
layer formats, can be realized by increasing 
the proportions of selected tabular grain populations
in photographic emulsions.Although varied definitions have been adopted
in defining tabular grain emulsions, there is a general
consensus that the functionally significant
distinguishing feature of tabular grains lies in the
disparity between tabular grain equivalent circular
diameter (ECD, the diameter of a circle having an area
equal to the projected area of the tabular grain) and
tabular grain thickness (t, the dimension of the
tabular grain normal to its opposed parallel major
faces). Tabular grain aspect ratio (ECD/t) is an art
accepted quantifier of this disparity. To distinguish
tabular grain emulsions from those that contain only
incidental tabular grain inclusions it is also the
recognized practice of the art to require that a
significant percentage (e.g., greater than 30 percent
and more typically greater than 50 percent)
of total grain projected area be accounted for by
tabular grains having an aspect ratio
