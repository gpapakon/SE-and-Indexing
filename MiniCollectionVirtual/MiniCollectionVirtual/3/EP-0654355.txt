<ABSTRACT>
A method for making an image by means of a direct thermal imaging 
element, comprising on a support a thermosensitive layer 

incorporating an organic silver salt and a reducing agent contained 
in said thermosensitive layer and/or in other optional layers, said 

imaging element being imagewise heated by means of a thermal head 
having energisable heating elements, wherein the activation of the 

heating elements is executed duty cycled pulsewise, comprising the 
steps of preheating each heating element for a preheating time such 

that a preheat temperature in the imaging element is reached, which 
is just below the conversion temperature; selecting a pulse duty 

cycle being such that a maximal density on the imaging element will 
be reached at the end of the maximal writing time; retrieving pro 

individual pixel from a memory an individual writing time related to 
a desired density on the imaging element; and energising the heating 

elements with the selected pulse duty cycle for a time related to 
the retrieved individual writing time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording method for direct
thermal imaging.Thermal imaging or thermography is a recording process wherein
images are generated by the use of imagewise modulated thermal
energy. Thermography is concerned with materials which are not
photosensitive, but are sensitive to heat or thermosensitive and
wherein imagewise applied heat is sufficient to bring about a
visible change in a thermosensitive imaging material, by a chemical
or a physical process which changes the optical density.Most of the direct thermographic recording materials are of the
chemical type. On heating to a certain conversion temperature, an
irreversible chemical reaction takes place and a coloured image is
produced.In direct thermal printing, said heating of the recording material
may originate from the image signals which are converted to electric
pulses and then through a driver circuit selectively transferred to
a thermal printhead. The thermal head consists of microscopic heat
resistor elements, which convert the electrical energy into heat via
the Joule effect. The electric pulses thus converted into thermal
signals manifest themselves as heat transferred to the surface of
the thermosensitive imaging material wherein the chemical reaction
resulting in colour development takes place. This principle is
described in "Handbook of Imaging Materials" (edited by Arthur S.
Diamond - Diamond Research Corporation - Ventura, California,
printed by Marcel Dekker, Inc. 270 Madison Avenue, New York, ed
1991, p. 498-499).A particular interesting direct thermal imaging element uses an
organic silver salt in combination with a reducing agent. Such
combination may be imaged by a suitable heat source such as e.g. a
thermal head, a laser etc. A black and white image can be obtained 
with such a material because under the influence of heat the silver
ions are developed to metallic silver.However, when imaged with a thermal head it appears to be difficult
to obtain a neutral black tone image. For this purpose it has been
suggested to add toning agents, but these still do not yield
satisfactory results. Furthermore, it appears to be difficult to
obtain a desired number of grey levels which may be required for
some application, in particular if the image is to be used for
medical diagnostic purposes.Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved recording method for making an image using a direct thermal
imaging element, comprising on a support a thermosensitive layer
containing a
