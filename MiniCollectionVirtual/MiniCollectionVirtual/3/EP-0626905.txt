<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diaphragms for use in pumps 
and valves. More particularly, the present invention relates a 
diaphragm composed of a flexible polymer adhered to a solid 
polytetrafluoroethylene layer. The rubber and plastics industries for years have used 
reinforcing fabric members in conjunction with flexible polymers to 
produce reinforced flexible composite materials to fabricate a 
variety of mechanical goods such as tires, hose, liners, 
diaphragms, seals, gaskets, protective fabrics, tapes, 
accumulators, airbags, fuel cells, fuel tanks, flexible couplings, 
medical tubing, structural bearings and so forth. The purpose of reinforcing members in reinforced flexible 
materials is to limit deformation of the composite materials, to 
satisfy requirements of the intended service, to strengthen the 
composite, to maintain dimensional stability, to absorb energy and 
to extend service life. Over the years,improved reinforcing fabrics have progressed 
through cotton, rayon, nylon, polyester, glass, steel, polyaramides 
and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fibers. These materials have 
been used in the form of individual fibers or cords and in the form 
of a woven, knitted or braided fabrics. Each of these reinforcing 
fabrics contributes unique attributes to the reinforced flexible 
composite material's physical properties and each suffers from 
limitations in certain critical physical properties such as 
strength, elongation, stiffness, flexibility, fatigue resistance, 
creep resistance, and chemical and thermal stability.  
 A particular advance in the use of fabrics to reinforce 
composites was taught in U.S. Patent No. 2,772,444 to Burrows, et 
al. outlining the use of PTFE in oriented fiber form. Industry 
has investigated the use of PTFE in oriented fiber form in 
composite structures, however, because of its low tensile strength, 
poor creep resistance and high cold flow, its use as reinforcement 
in flexible composites has been very limited. U.S. Patent No. 
3,513,064, to Westley, et al. discloses the use of PTFE fiber in 
conjunction with a fluoroelastomer and a fluoroplastic for use in 
protective clothing where the low physical properties of the fabric 
are adequate for the end-use. One area where reinforced composites have demonstrated utility 
is in diaphragms for use in valves and for pumps. In the past, a 
wide range of flexible polymers combined with reinforcing fabrics 
have been used. The identity of the particular materials used is 
dependent on the end use of the
