<ABSTRACT>
Thermal management of flat pack rechargeable 
batteries is accomplished by providing extensions on 

individual cell housing components, which extensions are 
connecte
d to provide open air channels between individual 
cells. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, 

cells within the stack are filled with a thermally 
conductive liquid, such as a silica gel, to assist in 

heat dissipation from adjacent cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the art 
of rechargeable batteries and more particularly to the 
thermal management of battery cells. Small rechargeable batteries are becoming 
increasingly important with the continuing development of 
portable electronic appliances, such as uninterruptible 
power systems (UPS). The batteries which are used with 
such devices are frequently referred to as flat pack 
batteries. It is highly desirable that such batteries be 
compact and light in weight yet have a high storage 
capacity. Advances have been made in this technology in recent 
years, even using conventional lead-acid battery 
technology. Lead-acid batteries typically suffer from 
weight disadvantages due to the weight of the plate 
materials (lead plates and lead-containing active 
materials) and the weight of the containers which are 
required to hold the plates and electrolyte. Lead-acid 
batteries, however, have very good power delivery 
characteristics and may be repeatedly recharged and even 
overcharged, with only minimal damage to the cells. 
Moreover, the power curve of lead-acid batteries is  
 
relatively predictable. Such features are not readily 
achievable with other batteries, such as nickel cadmium 
batteries. One type of lead-acid battery is the recombinant 
battery which differs from conventional lead-acid 
batteries (for example, automobile batteries) in that 
there is no flowing electrolyte in the system. 
Substantially all of the electrolyte is maintained in 
separator material, typically made of a glass fiber mat, 
located between the plates. The gasses evolved during 
the electrochemical reactions which take place in lead-acid 
batteries are absorbed and recombined within the 
battery rather than being vented in the normal case. 
With such systems, the battery can be sealed and made 
maintenance free. Other recombinant systems still use 
valves to relieve any undesirable build-up of pressure 
within the cells of the battery. One recent development in the field of recombinant 
lead-acid batteries is described in United States Patent 
No. 4,996,128 issued December 26, 1991 to Aldecoa and 
Miller entitled "Rechargeable Battery" (hereafter, the 
"'128 patent"). The battery described in this patent 
includes a thin plastic casing having generally 
rectangular top and bottom portions, the casing including 
lead foil sheets for the positive and negative plates, 
each foil being pasted with an appropriate active 
material. Separator layers are placed between the active 
material.
