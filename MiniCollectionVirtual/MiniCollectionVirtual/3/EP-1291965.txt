<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanical drive reflecting mirror antenna
device that conducts two-axial scanning of an azimuth and elevation mainly used in a
VHF band, a UHF band, a micro-wave band and an extremely-high frequency band.Fig. 28 is a schematic structural view showing a reflecting mirror antenna
device that conducts the mechanical drive scanning with respect to rotary axes in an
azimuth direction and an elevation direction disclosed in, for example, Takashi
Kitsuregawa, "Advanced Technology in Satellite Communication Antennas: Electrical
& Mechanical Design", ARTECH HOUSE INC., pp.232-235, 1990.Referring to Fig. 28, reference numeral 61 denotes a main reflection mirror;
62 is a sub-reflection mirror; 63 is a primary radiator; 64 is a circularly polarized wave
generator; 65 is a polarization divider; 66 is a receiver; 67 is an elevation shaft rotary
joint; 68 is an azimuth shaft rotary joint; 69 is a transmitter; 70 is an elevation shaft
rotary mechanism; and 71 is an azimuth shaft rotary mechanism.Subsequently, an operation will be described. A signal outputted from the
transmitter 69 is inputted to the polarization divider 65 through the rotary joints 68
and 67, and thereafter transformed into a circularly polarized wave from a linearly
polarized wave by the circularly polarized wave generator 64 and then radiated into 
air through the primary radiator 63 and the sub-reflection mirror 62 by the main
reflection mirror 61. Also, an electric wave received by the main reflection mirror 61
is transformed into the linearly polarized wave from the circularly polarized wave
through the sub-reflection mirror 62 and the primary radiator 63 by the circularly
polarized wave generator 64, inputted to the polarization divider 65 and thereafter
enters the receiver 66.Because the main reflection mirror 61, the sub-reflection mirror 62, the
primary radiator 63, the circularly polarized wave generator 64 and the polarization
divider 65 can be driven within a wide angular range by the rotary mechanisms 70,
71 and the rotary joints 67, 68 without deteriorating the electric characteristics, an
antenna beam can be transmitted while scanning over a wide angle. Also, because
the main reflection mirror 61, the sub-reflection mirror 62, the primary radiator 63, the
circularly polarized wave generator 64, the polarization divider 65 and the receiver 66
can be driven integrally within a wide angular range by the rotary mechanisms 70
and 71, they can receive an electric wave coming from the wide angular range.In
