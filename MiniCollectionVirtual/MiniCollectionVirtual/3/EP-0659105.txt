<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to regeneration of 
deactivated hydrocarbon processing catalysts comprising 
catalytic metals dispersed in a zeolite, particularly 
but not exclusively, reforming catalysts including one 
or more Group VIII metals in a large pore zeolite, such 
as platinum in zeolite L. The process of this 
invention is particularly effective for regenerating 
catalysts which have been more severely deactivated 
than is usual, for example, due to process upsets or to 
multi-cycle of on-oil regeneration operations. Such, 
catalysts regenerated in accordance with the present 
invention have been found to recover more of their 
activity and selectivity than if they were regenerated 
using conventional procedures. The general principles 
of the inventive process comprise (i) increasing the 
severity and time of the coke burn, (ii) using a source 
of high partial pressure chlorine in the 
oxychlorination step to redisperse catalytic metal 
e.g., platinum, (iii) improving chlorine removal by a 
wet, high temperature post treatment, at low pressure 
and (iv) enhancing reduction of catalytic metal by 
using high temperature at low pressure. Catalytic reforming is a major petroleum refining 
process used to raise the octane rating of naphthas (C6 
to C11 hydrocarbons) for gasoline blending. Catalytic 
reforming is also a principal source of aromatic 
chemicals, i.e., benzene, toluene and xylenes, via 
conversion of paraffins and naphthenes to aromatics. The principal reforming chemical reactions are  
 
dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to aromatics, dehydrocyclization 
of paraffins to aromatics, 
dehydroisomerization of alkylcyclopentanes to 
aromatics, isomerization of normal paraffins to 
branched paraffins, dealkylation of alkylbenzenes, and 
hydrocracking of paraffins to light hydrocarbons. The 
hydrocracking of paraffins to light hydrocarbons is 
undesirable and should be minimized because light 
hydrocarbons have low value. Reforming is typically carried out at temperatures 
of 426° to 538°C (800°F to 1000°F), pressures of 0.34 to 
20.7 MPa (50 to 3000 psi), hourly weight space 
velocities of 0.5 to 3.0, and in the presence of 
hydrogen at molar ratios to feed of 1 to 10. Other 
characteristics of reforming processes are well known 
in the art, and reference is made to US-A-4,914,068 for 
further teachings on this topic. Catalysts currently used in commercial reformers 
include a Group VIII metal, such as platinum, or 
platinum plus a second catalytic metal, such as rhenium 
or iridium, dispersed on an
