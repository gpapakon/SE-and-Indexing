Device for assisting the control of engine output, 
particularly of motor vehicles, comprised of at least one 

speed sensor (9), of a selector of an instruction (16), of an 
electronic unit (12) and of a servomotor (7), characterised 

in that the servomotor is used in automatic control of force 
in order to produce a controlled return force (F) on the 

output adjustment element in direct dependence on the driver, 
for example, a pedal (3), by means of a mechanical link. 
Assistance device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the servomotor (7) can adjust the return force (F) 

continuously, from a minimum value to a maximum value by 
displacing the components of the forces which are exerted on 

the output element (6) according to a control signal (11) 
which it receives from the electronic unit. 
Assistance device according to either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the return force (F) produced by the 

output movement lever (6) of the servomotor (7) is a 
component of the traction force of a spring (20) held between 

a pivot (21) firmly fixed to the lever (6) and a movable 
pivot (22), this pivot being displaced by a motor or geared 

motor with non reversible mechanical movement, according to 
the control signal (11), from a point I aligned with the axis 

(17) of the lever (6) to a point J so that the adjusted force 
is unidirectional and opposed to that by which the driver 

acts when he increases the output of the engine of  
 

the vehicle. 
Assistance device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the mechanism for breaking down 

forces of the servomotor can be integrated into the 
accelerator pedal, the lever (6) being replaced by an arm of 

the pedal on which the spring (20) acts directly according to 
the displacement of the rocker bar (28) which carries the 

pivot (22), the rocker bar being able either to be connected 
firmly to the geared motor or articulated on an independent 

axis and driven by the geared motor by means of a mechanical 
link. 
Assistance device according to any of claims 1, 2, 3, 
characterised in that the mechanical link (5) can be entirely 

common or associated partly with the servomotor and partly 
with the output control, a single action damping device can 

be connected to the output device (6) and to the mounting 
base of the mechanism, limits of travel and a stop limit the 

course of the pivot (22), stops (37) (38) limit the course of 
the output element. 
Assistance device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the pivot (22) can be 

positioned by the electronic unit according to a calculated 
force instruction and to the position datum of the pivot issuing 

from the sensor (23) or the position determined by counting 
the revolutions of the engine and/or by directly measuring 

the force produced by means of a known force transducer or  
 

strain gauges (30) firmly fixed to the lever, and in that the 
axis (17) can be contained between the positions I and J of 

the course of the pivot (22) in order to produce, if 
necessary, a bidirectional force. 
Assistance device according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the electronic unit is produced on the 

basis of a monochip microcontroller (49) of which the 
programme determines a signal (11) which controls the 

servomotor by means of an output interface (40) according to 
input signals and parameters of instructions stored in a 

rewritable memory and/or from a selection keypad and/or from 
external data. 
Assistance device according to any of claims 1, 2, 7 
characterised in that in that the force instruction which 

determines the adjustment of the servomotor is the largest of 
the control signals calculated by the programme between the 

limitation/adjustment signal formed from the divergence 
between the speed measurement and the speed instruction 

according to the mode of action known as proportional and 
derived, and the control signals determined by other data 

such as the engine speed, external instructions and safety data, 
and in that the force instruction can also be temporarily forced 

to a low value by the action of a signal controlled by 
declutching or when the speed of the displacement of the 

accelerator pedal exceeds a predetermined threshold, this 
speed being transmitted by a sensor integrated in the 

servomotor or issuing from an external datum.  
 
Assistance device according to any of claims 1, 2, 7, 
characterised in that the electronic unit can control a 

display of data and that it can produce an alarm signal when 
the speed divergence is kept at an excessive value. 
Assistance device according to any of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 
characterised in that the servomotor can act on the pedal 

either directly by means of a cable (5) freely connected to 
the arm (43) so as to be able to be active only in the 

direction of the traction, or by actuating, by means of the 
cable (5), an intermediate lever (41) which can act on the 

pedal only in the direction of the reduction of output of the 

engine and without, in each case, the pedal being able to be 
held in its natural return movement by the springs (4) and 

(45) and in that according to a different embodiment an 
elastic link with limited clearance can be provided between 

the point of application of the force and the abutment 
surface on the driver's foot pedal, this link being able to 

be a resilient pedal surface.
