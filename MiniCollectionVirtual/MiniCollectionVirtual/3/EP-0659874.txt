<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent
compositions, useful in machine dishwashing,
containing in combination, a carboxylate or
polycarboxylate builder, an organo diphosphonic acid
crystal growth inhibitor and a low molecular weight
polymer containing acrylic acid.Detergent compositions designed for use in automatic
dishwasher machines are well known, and a consistent
effort has been made by detergent manufacturers to
improve the cleaning and/or rinsing efficiency of said
compositions on dishes and glassware, as reflected by
numerous patent publications.The general problem of the formation of deposits as spots
and films on the articles in the wash, and on the
dishwasher machine parts is well known in the art. Whilst the general problem of deposit formation is known, a
full understanding of the many facets of the problem is
however still an active area of research.A range of deposit types can be encountered. The
redoposition of soils or the breakdown products thereof,
which have previously been removed from the soiled
tableware in the washload, provides one deposit type.
Insoluble salts such as calcium carbonate, calcium fatty
acid salts (lime soaps), or certain silicate salts are
other common deposit types. Composite deposit types are
also common. Indeed, once an initial minor deposit forms
it can act as a "seeding centre" for the build up of a
larger, possibly composite, deposit structure.Deposit formation can occur on a range of commonly
encountered substrate surfaces including plastic, glass,
metal and china surfaces. Certain deposit types however,
show a greater propensity to deposit on certain substrates.
For example, lime soap deposit formation tends to be a
particular problem on plastic substrates, and silicate
deposit formation tends to occur on glassware.The formation of insoluble carbonate, especially calcium
carbonate, deposits is a particular problem in the machine
dishwashing art. There is a general appreciation in the
art, as represented for example by EP-A-364,067 in the name
of Clorox, CH-A-673,033 in the name of Cosmina, and EP-A-551,670
in the name of Unilever, that calcium carbonate
deposit formation is a particular problem when non-phosphate
containing detergent formulations are employed.
In general, this can be explained by the slightly inferior
builder capacity of the typically employed non-phosphate
builder systems in comparison to phosphate builder
formulations. The problem of calcium carbonate deposit
formation is understood to be especially apparent when
these formulations
