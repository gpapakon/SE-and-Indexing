<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to light measurement
apparatus, in particular, though not exclusively, to
colour and/or intensity measurement apparatus for use
with for example a biomedical diagnostic test card.In recent years there have been developed test
cards, e.g. solid phase immunoassay test cards, for
biomedical diagnostic purposes. Such test cards are
normally provided with one or more test sites, normally
only a few millimetres (eg. about 5 millimetres) wide,
to which a liquid sample (e.g. blood or serum) is
applied. The test sites are designed to change colour
in response to the presence and concentration of a
particular component (e.g. a certain protein) in the
liquid sample.This colour change can, at least to a certain
extent, be detected and measured by eye, by for example
comparing a treated test site with a reference colour
chart. Such visual techniques are, however, clearly
unsatisfactory when it is desired to produce an accurate
reliable measurement. To obtain reliably highly
accurate measurements, an instrumental system is sought.Measurement of colour, colour spectra and colour
intensity of an opaque surface is performed by analyzing
the light reflected from the surface when exposed to a
defined light. It is essential that the surface area to
be measured and the detection system are not exposed to
external light during measurements, and light shielding
of the mechanism is therefore provided. This is
particularly critical if weak light sources such as
light emitting diodes (LEDs) are used rather than strong
sources such as xenon arc lamps or the like. It is also
important that the light emitter and the light detector
have defined positions relative to the surface to be
measured. Conventional instruments for analyzing surface
colours tend to be large and heavy, thus not readily
transportable, or smaller but still inflexible in use.
Attempts to develop more versatile, small transportable
systems have been made, but to date no known system
meets all the requirements to overcome the problems of
the prior art.According to the present invention there is
provided light measurement apparatus comprising an
elongate member, said elongate member having at one end
thereof light-emitting means and light-detecting means,
at least the end of said elongate member provided with
said light-emitting means and said light-detecting means
being surrounded by a resiliently biassed sheath whereby
in use when said elongate member is applied to a surface
to take a reading said sheath defines a light-tight
enclosure.Prefer

<CLAIMS>
Light measurement apparatus comprising an elongate
member (1), said elongate member having at one end

thereof light-emitting means (6) and light-detecting
means (7), at least the end of said elongate member

provided with said light-emitting means (6) and said
light-detecting means (7) being surrounded by a

resiliently biassed sheath (8) whereby in use when said
elongate member (1) is applied to a surface to take a

reading said sheath (8) defines a light-tight enclosure.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the light-detecting
means is a photodiode.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which
the light-emitting means is a light-emitting diode.
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims
in which two or more light-emitting means are provided

to emit light at different wavelengths or two or more
switchable filters are provided with a single light-emitting

means.
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims
in which the resiliently biased sheath is adapted to be

slidable between the position in which it defines a
light-tight enclosure, and a position in which the end

of the elongate member is exposed.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 in which the end of
the sheath adjacent the end of the elongate member is

provided with a sealing ring.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6 in
which the elongate member is in a perpendicular

orientation relative to said surface when the sheath 
defines a light-tight enclosure.
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims
in which the tip of the elongate member is provided with

a light sensor within the light-tight enclosure and
control means whereby light measurement is only taken by

the light-detecting means when it is sufficiently dark
within the light-tight enclosure for a reliable accurate

reading to be taken.
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims
in which the light-emitting means and light-detecting

means arranged asymmetrically with respect to the
central axis of the elongate member.
A method of detecting the colour of a test site in
an analytical method giving rise to a coloured response,

such as a solid phase immunoassay, comprising using the
apparatus as claimed in claim 1 to measure intensity of

colour developed in the test site.
A method as claimed in claim 10 in which the said
test site is about 5 millimetres wide.
