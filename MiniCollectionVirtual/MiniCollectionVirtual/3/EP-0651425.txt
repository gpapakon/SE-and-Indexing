<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plasma reactor which generates a 
plasma for processing a semiconductor substrate, and in 
particular to a method for holding the substrate and a method 
for processing the substrate in the plasma reactor. An etching system with an electrostatic chuck has been described 
in Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol 17, no 463 (E-1420) 24 August 
1993 & JP-A-05 109 666 (Shibaura Eng Works Co LTD). An electrostatic chuck holds a wafer onto a pedestal 
inside a plasma reactor chamber using electrostatic 
attraction. This overcomes the problems of conventional 
metal clamp rings used for the same purpose, such 
problems including the masking of the wafer periphery by 
the metal ring, metal-to-semiconductor contact problems 
with particulate contamination and the susceptibility of 
the metal ring to etch damage from the plasma. However, the electrostatic chuck itself is 
susceptible to etch damage from the plasma, particularly 
when employed in a plasma etch process. This is because 
the electrostatic chuck typically consists of a conductor 
such as a copper film covered top and bottom by an 
insulator film such as polyimide, which is susceptible to 
being removed by the plasma. In order to hold the wafer 
to the chuck, the copper layer is held at a high voltage 
(e.g., 600 volts D.C.). If the plasma removes enough 
polyimide insulation from the copper conductor to short 
the conductor to the plasma, there is insufficient 
electrostatic force to hold the wafer to the chuck. Another problem is that in a typical electrostatic 
chuck, the wafer periphery overhangs the edge of the 
chuck, so that any plasma escaping beyond the edge of the 
wafer not only etches the electrostatic chuck, as  
 
discussed above, but also etches the backside of the 
wafer periphery, an undesirable effect. The foregoing problems with the electrostatic chuck 
arise primarily because there must be at least a small 
(1-3 mm) circumferential gap between the wafer edge and 
the side wall of the chamber. Typically, the chamber 
side wall, in certain reactor types, is quartz and is 
consumed slowly over the course of processing many wafers 
to provide a material for scavenging fluorine in a plasma 
etch process. It is through the circumferential gap 
between the quartz side wall and the wafer periphery that 
the plasma can extend at a high rate to the region behind the wafer, so 
as to corrosively attack the electrostatic chuck and the 
wafer periphery backside. It is the object of the present invention to overcome the above
