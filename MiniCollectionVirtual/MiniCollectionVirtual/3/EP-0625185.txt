<DESCRIPTION>
Cleaning compositions to remove from surfaces such as carpets,
cloth, hard surfaces, leather and suede, deleterious deposits and
stains so as to restore them as closely as possible to a clean
condition.Porous surfaces, such as those of carpets, clothing, table-cloths,
napkins, automobile seats, athletic shoes, leather, suede,
and certain metal and metal composites, to name only few, and hard
surfaces such as concrete, stucco, metal signs, tile, wallpaper and
wood floors, often receive deleterious deposits, stains, and
graffiti. Such deposits vary widely in their identity. Some may be
quite viscous, for example paints, greases, and sauces such as
mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Others are more liquid in nature,
such as pet stains, wines, oft drinks, ball point inks, marker
inks, fountain pen inks, and printers inks. Still others may be
more solid or pasty, including foods, especially proteinaceous foods,
water-based adhesives, and latex-based paints.Some types of hard surfaces often have deposits respective to
their storage and preservation. Examples are oily compositions to 
protect them from corrosion, residues from cutting oils for which a
degreaser is usually needed, and dust on disc brakes which must be
removed.The above recitation exemplifies a broad range of materials
which need to be cleaned of a broad range of deposits and stains. In
response to this need, an equally wide range of cleaning compositions
already exists in the market. US-A-4485028 discloses a cleaning solution containing an
oxidizing agent selected from the class consisting of ammonium persulfate and alkali metal
persulfates, the cleaning solution further comprising a chelating agent, an inorganic soil
suspender, a hydrotrope, a cleaning detergent, a water-miscible solvent, and H2O of potable
quality. US-A-3607760 discloses a composition for removing pet stains from carpets and the like
comprising butylcellosolve, isopropyl alcohol (or ethyl alcohol), hydrogen peroxide, ethylene
diamine tetracetic acid, and water.Generally speaking, however, commercial compositions are
limited both in the range of their effectiveness and also as to how
efficient they really are for their intended purpose. Consequently,
if one intends to remove a wide range of kinds of deposits or
stains, one is likely to find a nearly-equal number of formulations
to buy for that purpose, each somewhat specific for a given deposit
or stain. Even then, some of the stains and deposits are usually
only partially removed. Furthermore, many of the commercial
composition
