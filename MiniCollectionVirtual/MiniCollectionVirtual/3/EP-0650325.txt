<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel pesticidal compositions. The insecticidal product lambda-cyhalothrin has previously been 
formulated in various ways, including for example emulsifiable 
concentrates, suspension concentrates, and aerosol formulations, the exact 
formulation being chosen in relation to the type and location of the pests 
intended to be controlled. Previously emulsifiable concentrates have been 
made and used very successfully for the control of lepidopterous and aphid 
pests in various crops, such as cereals, vines and sunflowers. In recent years there has been a desire to decrease the costs of 
applying pesticides to crops by combining the application of two or more 
products, for example an insecticide and a fungicide, in a single spraying 
operation. This is carried out by the applicator mixing together the 
concentrated insecticide and concentrated fungicide in the same spray tank 
and diluting the mixture with water until the correct concentration of the 
active ingredients is obtained. The existing emulsifiable concentrate formulation of 
lambda-cyhalothrin was not in all respects suitable for this operation 
because it was incompatible with the formulations of the principal 
fungicides which the applicator would wish to use. This incompatability 
leads to the the separation of the components of the mixture in the spray 
tank and spray head and results in poor application to the crops being 
treated. It was therefore desired to devise an emulsifiable concentrate 
having the required compatability with preformulated compositions of 
fungicides. In addition it was desired to improve the overall safety of the 
compositions by reducing the risks of accidental ignition of the flammable 
components during the transfer of the concentrate into the spray tank. It 
was also desired to reduce the risks of inadvertant confusion with other 
pesticide products having the same general appearance, which could lead to 
the wrong product being put into the spray tank. According to the present invention there is provided a novel 
pesticidal composition in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate 
comprising as active ingredient the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin in 
combination with an emulsifier and a diluent characterised in that the 
emulsifier comprises a blend of anionic and non-ionic surfactants and the  
 
diluent is a solvent blend consisting mainly of alkylnaphthalenes and 
having a flash point greater than 83°C, and optionally comprising a 
oil-soluble dyestuff. Lambda-cyhalothrin is the ISO

A pesticidal composition in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate 
comprising as active ingredient the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin in 

combination with an emulsifier and a diluent characterised in that 
the emulsifier is a blend of anionic and non-ionic surfactants and the 

diluent is a solvent blend consisting mainly of alkylnaphthalenes 
having a flash point greater than 83°C, and optionally comprising a 

oil-soluble dyestuff. 
A composition according to claim 1 in which the amionic surfactant is 
selected from salts of sulphonic acids and the non-ionic surfactant is 

selected from alkylphenol alkoxylates. 
A composition according to Claim 1 which comprises from 20 to 
80 grams per litre of the lambda-cyhalothrin, and from 50 

to 150 grams per litre of the emulsifier. 
A composition according to Claim 3 in which the ratio (w/w) of 
emulsifier to lambda-cyhalothrin is within the range 0.75 to 2.5. 
A composition according to claim 1 where a dyestuff is present. 
A composition according to Claim 5 where the dyestuff is used at a 
rate within the range 0.001 to 0.5 grams per litre. 
A method of combating insect and fungal pests in an agricultural or 
horticultural crop which comprises mixing a composition as defined in 

claim 1 with a concentrated composition of a fungicide in a spray tank 
with sufficient water to dilute the mixture to the recommended 

concentration with respect to the active ingredients and spraying the 
mixture on the crop. 
A method according to Claim 7 wherein the fungicide is tebuconazole, 
propiconazole, cyproconazole, penconazole, hexaconazole, prochloraz 

and flutriafol.
