<ABSTRACT>
A scene change automatic detection unit 10 detects 
a scene change at the time of input storage of a 

dynamic image to retrieve the dynamic image as a search 
key, and a characteristics amount unit 12 calculates a 

characteristics amount of each scene. The 
characteristics amount is stored together with the 

dynamic image in the storage unit. In retrieval 
operation, a scene change automatic detection means 16 

detects a scene change of a dynamic image entered and a 
scene change automatic detection unit 18 calculates a 

characteristics amount of each scene. A correspondence 
determination unit 20 compares a characteristics amount 

of a stored dynamic image and a characteristics amount 
of a dynamic image entered as a search key and 

determines the correspondence of these characteristics 
amounts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and
an apparatus for retrieving dynamic or moving images and a
method of and an apparatus for managing images, capable of
efficiently retrieving in a short period of time desired
dynamic or moving images from stored images.As a method of retrieving desired dynamic images
from those dynamic images which have been stored in
advance, there have been a method for retrieving the
desired dynamic images according to classification
codes and associated information such as positional
data of all dynamic images which are stored for each
title of dynamic images and a method for visually
retrieving the images such as motion picture images by
a user while actually feeding the images at a high speed by the user
or directly retrieving the images at a
specified interval while observing frame sequence.As a method for retrieving the dynamic images by
using the images to be retrieved, one frame of images
to be retrieved has been entered and a frame
corresponding to the frame image entered has been
selected from all frames for actual retrieval.However, in a method of retrieving the dynamic 
images according to the above-described classification
code such as positional data, the user should store the
positional data in connection with each title of the
dynamic image; for example, even though the user has
wanted to know the data at a position on a video tape
where the desired title is stored, the dynamic image
could not be retrieved if there were no clue except the
video tape.In the method of visually retrieving the dynamic
images using rapid feeding, there is the problem that,
though this method can be executed if the number of
dynamic images stored is small, the time required for
retrieval is longer if a large number of dynamic images
are stored so that the method becomes impractical.In the method of retrieving stored images by
entering desired images, it is necessary to determine
whether an entered frame image is identical to a stored
frame image.Though pattern matching is available as a
practical method of retrieval, there has been a problem
that pattern matching for retrieval requires a lot of
time.As the other method, a histogram of images and
characteristics amount matching for determining whether
the image includes special information (for example,
character A) are available for retrieval. However, it 
is necessary to calculate in advance the
characteristics amount for each frame as a whole at the
time storage of images and a lot of time is required
for such calculation.In
