<ABSTRACT>
A hair care product contains (A) 0.1 to 30 % by weight of at least one organic and/or inorganic thickener; (B) 0.1 to 25 % by weight of at least one fixing water-soluble polymer which may be totally or partially precipitated by a change in pH; and (C) 45 to 99.8 % by weight water. This hair care product is (D) free from organic solvents and (E) has a pH value at which the component (B) is totally or partially precipitated. This product does not stress the hair and is thus particularly suitable for fine hair. In particular as a hair fixing product, it keeps the hair in place without glueing the hair or stressing it with an excess of fixing polymers. Fine hair becomes lush and full.

<CLAIMS>
Hair treatment agent containing:

(A) from 0.1 to 30%
by weight of at least one
organic and/or inorganic

thickener;
(B) from 0.1 to 25%
by weight of at least one
fixing water-soluble polymer

which can be precipitated
completely or partially by

changing the pH; and
(C) from 45 to 99.8%
by weight of water,

which agent
(D)
is free from organic solvents; and
(E)
has a pH at which component (B) is in a
completely or partially precipitated form.
Agent according to Claim 1, characterised
in that it contains from 0.15 to 15% by weight of

component (A). 
Agent according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that it contains from 0.2 to 10%

by weight of component (B).
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
3, characterised in that it contains from 55 to

96% by weight of component (C).
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
4, characterised in that it contains at least one

natural, modified natural and/or synthetic
thickener as component (A).
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
5, characterised in that it contains, as thickener

of component (A), polymers and copolymers of
acrylic acid, polymers and copolymers of

methacrylic acid, polymers and copolymers of
crotonic acid, polymers and copolymers of the

salts or esters of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid
or crotonic acid, copolymers that comprise

unsaturated acid anhydrides and alkyl vinyl ethers
and that have been crosslinked with dienes,

polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols,
polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol

copolymers, polysaccharides, derivatives or
hydrolysates of polysaccharides, gelatins,

hectorites or bentonites. 
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
6, characterised in that the fixing water-soluble

polymer of component (B) is a natural, modified
natural or synthetic film-forming polymer.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
7, characterised in that the fixing polymer of

component (B) is water-soluble when in the form of
its salt and water-insoluble when in the form of

the free base and/or acid.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
8, characterised in that it contains, as fixing

polymer of component (B), copolymers, graft
copolymers or terpolymers which contain compounds

from the group of the unsaturated monocarboxylic
acids, the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids or the

anhydrides of unsaturated dicarboxylic acids as
one monomer building block and an unsaturated

organic compound as further monomer building
block.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
9, characterised in that it has a pH of from 1.5

to 11.5.
