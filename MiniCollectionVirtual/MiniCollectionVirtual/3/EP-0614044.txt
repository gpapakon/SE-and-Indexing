<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to oxy-liquid fuel heating for 
producing elevated temperatures in industrial melting furnaces for such 
diverse products as metals, glass, ceramic materials and the like. In conventional liquid-fuel burners, liquid fuel atomization is 
effected by means of a single liquid-fuel jet or multiple liquid-fuel jets 
surrounded by a high velocity atomizing stream that is usually air, steam, 
oxygen or other gases used in the burner. The atomizing medium travels at 
velocities greater than approximately 100 meters per second for "air-blast 
atomizers" and up to sonic velocity for "air-assist atomizers", to cause 
the liquid-fuel to break up into small droplets suitable for combustion. 
For air-assist atomizers, the supply pressure of the atomizing medium, the 
angle of impact between the liquid jet and the flow rate of high velocity 
atomizing medium stream determines the mean drop size distribution. 
However, the use of high pressure oxygen as an atomizing medium, instead of 
an air stream or other atomizing gases in oxygen-fuel fired burners leads 
to a chain of operational problems. First, the expansion of high pressure 
atomizing oxygen at the burner tip results in a high oxygen velocity, which 
thoroughly mixes with liquid fuel during the atomization process. The 
liquid fuel-oxygen mixture thus formed is readily combustible in a high 
temperature environment. The absence of inert nitrogen and highly reactive 
oxygen promotes rapid and uncontrolled combustion resulting in a very high 
temperature flame in the vicinity of the oxy-fuel burner tips which 
generally leads to the following conditions: 
1. Deterioration/oxidation of burner nozzles. 2. Damage to burner block refractory material, which sometimes 
melts and obstructs the normal flame direction inside the burner block 
cavity. 3. Undesirable heating of furnace sidewalls, which is also a heat 
loss to the surroundings.  4. Short flame, due to smaller droplet-size distribution and 
higher reaction rates, coupled with non-uniform heat distribution to the 
furnace load. 5. Increased volatilization of certain batch ingredients, e.g. in 
the manufacture of glass PbO, Boron-containing species, etc. 6. Decreased productivity in pure product quality. 7. Shorter burner nozzle life and increased maintenance. The economics of the process are also affected by the type of 
atomization used. In general, a high pressure liquid oxygen supply is 
relatively more expensive than a low-pressure gaseous oxygen produced by 
pressure or
