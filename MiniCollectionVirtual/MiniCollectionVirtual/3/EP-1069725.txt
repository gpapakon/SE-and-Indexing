<ABSTRACT>
Spreading section 101 spreads each transmission
signal using a spreading code specific to the signal.

Spreading section 102 spreads a known signal using a
spreading code specific to the signal. S/P converter 104

breaks down a signal on which the spread transmission
signals and the known signal are multiplexed for every

chip and IFFT section 105 subjects the chip data string
to frequency division multiplexing. FFT section 107

carries out Fourier transform processing on the
reception signal and extracts each subcarrier signal.

P/S converter 109 converts a plurality of parallel
signals subjected to compensation processing to a single

serial signal. Despreading section 110 despreads the
reception signal converted to a serial signal using a

predetermined spreading code. Despreading section 111
despreads the reception signal converted to a serial

signal using a known signal spreading code. Residual
phase error detection section 113 detects a residual

phase error using the known signal and received known
signal subjected to despreading processing. Phase

compensation section 112 compensates each reception
signal based on the residual phase error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication apparatus, and more particularly, to a communication apparatus that carries out radio communications combining a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system in mobile communications.An error rate characteristic in a communication based on a CDMA system deteriorates in a multi-path environment because of interference between spreading codes. On the other hand, a well-known communication system resistant to interference between codes is an OFDM communication that uses a guard interval. Thus, a radio communication based on an OFDM-CDMA system that implements a CDMA-based communication with multiple carriers and performs transmission with subcarriers assigned to their respective chips then subjected to frequency division multiplexing is now a focus of attention as a next-generation radio communication system.In an OFDM-CDMA-based communication, a plurality of signals is spread using mutually not correlated spreading codes by assigning one spread signal to one subcarrier. If these spreading codes are completely orthogonal to each other, signals other than the necessary ones are completely removed through despreading processing at the time of reception regardless of the degree of signal multiplexing.Hereinafter, a conventional OFDM-CDMA-based communication apparatus will be explained using FIG.1. FIG.1 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional OFDM-CDMA-based communication apparatus.In the transmission system shown in FIG.1, each spreading section 11 carries out spreading processing by multiplying transmission signals 1 to n by their respective spreading codes 1 to n. Here, suppose their spreading factor is k.Addition section 12 adds up the transmission signals subjected to spreading processing. Serial/parallel (hereinafter referred to as "S/P") converter 13 converts a serial signal to a plurality of parallel signals. This S/P converter 13 divides the transmission signals thus spread and added up by spread signal or breaks down spread transmission signals 1 to n by spread signal (chip), that is, A 1st to kth chip.IFFT processing section 14 carries out inverse Fourier transform processing on a plurality of parallel signals. This IFFT processing section 14 assigns one subcarrier to one chip data signal string and carries out frequency division multiplexing.That is, the number of subcarriers corresponds to the spreading factor and it is "k" in this case. Suppose the 1st chip of
