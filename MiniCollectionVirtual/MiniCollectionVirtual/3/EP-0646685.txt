<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a concrete 
column forming tube and method of making same for 
receiving poured concrete therein to produce a concrete 
column and which utilizes an elongated cylindrical tube 
made of spirally-wound plies of paper adhered together 
and which is characterized by a smooth inside coated 
surface in the forming tube to eliminate spiral seam 
lines and other undesirable characteristics on an 
outside surface of the formed concrete column. For many years, concrete column forming tubes 
have been utilized and have been constructed of 
spirally-wound plies of paper adhered together and 
defining an inside wall surface of predetermined 
diameter which is coated with plastic material for 
concrete release properties. This plastic coating was 
usually provided by coating one side of the paper plies 
prior to spiral winding of the tube. These forming 
tubes received poured concrete therein which dried and 
set-up to produce a concrete column. The forming tube 
was then stripped away from the concrete column and this 
operation was aided by the release properties of the 
plastic coating on the inside of the tube to leave a 
finished concrete column. These types of prior art 
tubes are illustrated in U.S. Patents 2,677,165 and 
2,914,833, for example, which are assigned to the 
present applicant.  Due to the spirally-wound construction of 
these forming tubes, spiral seam lines and other 
undesirable surface characteristics were usually 
present on the inside wall surface of the forming tube 
which resulted in spiral seam lines and other 
irregularities molded on the outside surface of the 
produced concrete column. From an aesthetic 
standpoint, these spiral seam lines and other 
irregularities were often undesirable on the produced 
concrete column and sandblasting or other finishing 
techniques were necessary to produce a smooth outside 
surface on the concrete columns. In an effort to overcome these problems, 
separately-formed flexible cylindrical liners have been 
proposed by U.S. Patent No. 4,595,168 and our own 
U.S. Patent No. 4,957,270. These separate liners were 
inserted into the concrete column forming tube after 
manufacture of the tube and often at the concrete 
column forming site. While these separate liners 
improved the surface quality of the resulting concrete 
column, they did often produce one vertical seam line 
running the length of the formed column, were expensive 
to manufacture, difficult to maintain and install and 
presented other problems in the manufacture
