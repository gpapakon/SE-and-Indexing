<ABSTRACT>
A device for moulding articles of composite material comprises a 

pressurizable gasket (30) and an injection head (15) the end 
of which is flush with the 

impression of the mould. After low-pressure filling the mould impression with jets 
of resin and catalyst so oriented as to secure the mutual mixing thereof, the 

pressurizable gasket allows the half-moulds to be further approached to each other 
and obtaining thereby the impregnation of the reinforcer element previously 

charged into the mould impression.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for moulding
articles of composite materials. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a device comprising a female
half-mould designed to receive a reinforcer fibrous material,
a male half-mould designed to get tightly closed onto said
female half-mould and feeding means in order to feed the
suitable resin for impregnating the reinforcer material.The presently used processes for moulding articles of
composite materials (based on a thermosetting resin and a
reinforcer material) provide for a pre-catalysed resin to be
injected into a mould in which a reinforcer material was
previously charged, as interlaced fibres (fabric), or as a non
woven fabric (mat).The equipments used in such a technology, commonly
referred to as "RTM (Resin Transfer Moulding)", require that
the resin is considerably pressurized in order to enable the
reinforcer material to be completely impregnated, as wells as
a cleaning system for the pre-catalysed resin injection nozzle
in order to prevent said nozzle from accidentally clogging.
Such a second drawback was obviated by using separate
nozzles for feeding non-pre-catalysed resin and catalyst,
leading into a mixing chamber inside which a self-cleaning ram
is slidingly assembled. Such a solution, disclosed in European
Patent Application EP-A-529,651, requires however high
injection pressures which, besides increasing the complexity 
and costs of equipments used, implies the risk that a back
mixing of resin and catalyst takes place inside said nozzles.A further, well known, moulding technique, referred to
as "Compression Moulding" provides for the pre-catalysed resin
to be fed into a half-mould containing the reinforcer
material, followed by closing the half-mould, with consequent
reinforcer element impregnation. Such a technique, poorly
automated, requires that resin and catalyst are pre-mixed
and a predetermined/amount of resin/catalyst mixture is
subsequently added to the female half-mould. Clearly, such a
technique is neither suitable for high throughput rates (fast
manufacturing cycles), nor does it allow highly reproducible
results to be accomplished.The purpose of the present invention is of providing a
device of the type specified at the beginning of the instant
disclosure, which does not display the above said drawbacks,
and furthermore allows the costs to be reduced, as compared
to the prior equipments, using high-pressure injections of
resin and catalyst.Such a purpose is achieved thanks to the fact that the
resin feeding

Device (10) for manufacturing, by moulding, manufactured
articles of composite material, of the type comprising a

female half-mould (12) designed to receive a reinforcer fibrous
material (R), a male half-mould (14) designed to get tightly closed

onto said female half-mould and feeding means in order to feed
the suitable resin for impregnating the reinforcer material,

wherein said resin feeding means comprise:

-- a recessed seat (16) provided at the surface of the
mould impression of the male half-mould (14);
-- a closing ram (17) sliding inside said recessed seat
(16) and suitable for being moved to a back (retracted)

position and a forward (extended) position substantially
flush with the impression of the male half-mould (14),

and
-- one pair of nozzles (21,22) for respectively feeding
resin and catalyst, opening through the side walls of

said recessed seat (16), characterized in that said pair of
nozzles are arranged inclined to the axis (Y-Y) of said ram (17)

with the inclination of the nozzles (21,22) being such as to secure a mixing of
resin and catalyst jets to take place substantially

outside of said recessed seat (16) in a mutually spaced
apart configuration of said half-moulds (14,12).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said female half-mould (12) comprises, perimetrically around

its impression (12a), a groove (28), inside which a hollow,
pressurizable O-ring (30) is housed.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that each nozzle (21,22) comprises a flow control device of

pin regulator type (26).
Process for moulding manufactured articles of
composite material, characterized in that it comprises the

following steps:

-- preparing a female half-mould (12) inside the interior of
which a reinforcer fibrous material (R) is prepared,
-- preparing a male half-mould (14) opposite to
said female half-mould and provided with a

central recessed seat (16) inside which a closing ram (17) is
slidingly mounted and into which two feed

nozzles (21,22) open for feeding resin and catalyst,
respectively,
-- feeding said nozzles, with the closing ram being in a
retra
cted configuration, with resin and catalyst amounts
which are sufficient in order to secure the subsequent

impregnation of the reinforcer material,
-- moving the closing ram in such a way that its end comes 
to be substantially flush with the impression of the

male half-mould, simultaneously closing the nozzles,

and
-- moving both half-moulds apart from each other in order
to allow the manufactured item to be demoulded,

characterized in that:
-- the half-moulds (12,14) are spaced apart from
each other when the nozzles are fed with

resin and catalyst,
-- the nozzles (21,22) are inclined to the axis
(Y-Y) of the ram with the inclination of said nozzles being

such as to secure a mixing of the fed jets
substantially outside of the recessed seat, and in
-- tightly closing the half-moulds against each other, so
as to allow the catalysed resin to impregnate the

reinforcer material and set,
after the closing ram (17) has been

moved to the position flush with the mould surface.
