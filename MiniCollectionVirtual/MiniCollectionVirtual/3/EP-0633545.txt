<ABSTRACT>
Absolute encoders for the electronic read-out of a multi-digit roller counter for a volume or flow meter, which enables the determination of the instantaneous counter condition by means of the rotation of sensors (18) through a specific angle with respect to the counter rollers (2) by means of markings (5, 21) applied to the counter rollers (2) at uniform spacings.

<CLAIMS>
Multidigit roller counting mechanism for an electricity meter or for a volume-measuring
instrument for gas or water, in which mechanism the higher value number

wheel (2) of each two number wheels (2) is rotated further through a tenth of one
revolution by way of a switching pinion (3) by the lower value one in the last tenth of its

revolution, characterised in that a first equipment (6, 7, 20), which is rotatable through an
angle of less than 360° and which on a rotation relative to the number wheels (2) delivers

at least two signals relating to the setting of the number wheels (2), is mounted on the axle
(1) of the number wheels (2) or on an axle parallel to the axle (1) of the number wheels (2)

and each time between the number wheels (2), as well as with a second equipment (11),
which sets the first equipment (6, 7, 20) into rotation for a read-out and produces signals

for the recognition of the instantaneous absolute rotary angle of the first equipment (6, 7,

20) and with a logical interlinking between the signals of the first equipment (6, 7, 20) and
the rotary angle signals of the second equipment in such a manner that the instantaneous

angular setting of each number wheel (2) is ascertainable.
Multidigit roller counting mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in that the
equipments (6, 7, 20), which are rotatable through an angle of less than 360°, for the

production of at least two signals consist of fork light barriers (6, 7), which are each
fastened radially on a respective arm (10) and the light beam of which is interrupted by

markings (5, 21), for example in the form of annular segments of different length, applied
at the number wheel (2).
Multidigit roller counting mechanism according to claim 1, characterised in that the
equipments which are rotatable through an angle of less than 360°, for the production of at

on the one side of the marking (5, 21) of the number wheel (2) and a light source (17), the

light beam of which is freed by openings (24) formed in non-uniform distribution in the
number wheel (2), is mounted each time on the other side.
