<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce highly efficient solar cells made of polycrystalline or monocrystalline semiconductive material, the back side contacts are imprinted with a metal-containing paste and the front side contacts are finely structured by chemical deposition. By using an ionogenic germination solution, it is possible to generate a specific metallization exclusively in openings or pits on the front side in which the passivation layer that covers the semiconductive layer has been removed. By chemical deposition of at least another metal over the germination layer that was first generated, the front side contact is chemically or galvanically reinforced.

Process of producing front side and rear side contacts on a solar cell, made from a monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon wafer (S) with a shallow p/n-transition (ÜB) and a passivation layer (OX) at the front side, comprising the steps of:'

- providing a trench structure (GR) in the passivation layer (OX),
- providing the rear side contact (RK) by imprinting and baking a silver-containing paste, said paste containing, in addition to oxidic components, also aluminum as a dopant,
- treating the wafer (S) with an ionogenic palladium solution containing fluoride ions to produce a seed layer (KS) on the free surface of the wafer (S) in the trench pattern (GR),
- strengthening the seed layer (KS) by chemical or galvanic deposition of at least one additional metal (VS).
Process according to claim 1, wherein the trench structure is defined by photolithography and produced by wet chemical etching.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the trench structure (GR) is produced by laser writing.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the trench structure (GR) is produced by mechanical removal of passivation layer (OX) and of silicon and by subsequent etching or subsequent laser structuring.
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the palladium seed layer (KS) is strengthened by chemical deposition of a nickel layer (Ni) having a thickness
 of 1 to 5 µm and subsequent by currentless deposition of a copper layer (VS) having a thickness of 5 to 20 µm.
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the palladium seed layer (KS) is strengthened by deposition of a silver layer (VS) having a thickness of 5 to 20 µm.
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 6, wherein a silicon wafer (S) having a textured surface is used.
Process according to any of the claims 1 to 7, wherein the rear side contact (RK) is applied to the rear side of the wafer (S) by screen printing in the form of a net structure.
