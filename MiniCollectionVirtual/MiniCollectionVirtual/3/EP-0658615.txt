<ABSTRACT>
Benzene and other aromatics are separated from a stream of mixed 
hydrocarbons containing both aromatics and non-aromatics by extractive 

distillation with a solvent system containing dimethyl sulfoxide and optionally 
a co-solvent, preferably water, followed by distillation stripping of the 

aromatics from the enriched solvent system, and recycle of the lean solvent 
system to the extractive distillation step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method or process for removing and 
recovering benzene and/or other aromatic hydrocarbons from a mixed 
stream of hydrocarbons, typically a stream of the kind intended to be 
worked up into a finished gasoline. Feed sources such as pyrolysis gasoline, 
catalytic reformate, or coal tar liquids may be sources of the mixed 
hydrocarbon stream utilized in the process. Many similar relatively light 
hydrocarbon streams containing benzene as well as other aromatic 
hydrocarbons are utilized to formulate finished gasoline. At one time, 
benzene and other aromatics were not considered objectionable components  
 
of gasoline, and were even regarded favorably because of their high octane 
numbers, but the situation is now changing because of governmental 
restrictions being placed on the amount of benzene considered acceptable 
in finished gasolines. Furthermore, benzene, and other aromatic 
hydrocarbons, are more valuable in their own right as starting materials for 
important petrochemical products, and have greater value in such uses than 
as fuel. For reasons such as these, there is an increasing need for efficient 
and economical processes for separating benzene from mixed hydrocarbon 
streams, and it is an object of the present invention to provide such a 
process. In accordance with the present invention, a method or process is 
provided for recovering benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons from a 
mixed stream containing them as well as non-aromatic hydrocarbons. The 
process involves extractive distillation of the benzene-containing mixed 
hydrocarbon feed stock in the presence of an extractive distillation solvent 
system which is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and optionally one or more co-solvents, 
preferably water. In the extractive distillation step, the non-aromatic 
hydrocarbons form the overhead raffinate stream. A bottoms 
stream containing the solvent system enriched by the dissolved benzene 
and/or other aromatic hydrocarbons is passed from the distillation column  
 
as a bottoms stream separate from the overhead stream, thus effecting the 
separation of the aromatics from the other hydrocarbons. The bottoms 
stream is then subjected to a stripping operation in which the aromatics are 
removed as an overhead product, together with a minor amount of dimethyl 
sulfoxide and water (if used), and the bottoms product from the stripping 
step is a solvent system which is lean in benzene or other aromatics. The overhead stream from the stripping step may be condensed, and
