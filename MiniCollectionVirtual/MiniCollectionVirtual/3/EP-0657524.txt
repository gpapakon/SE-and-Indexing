<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to greases to be used
with moving objects, one with respect to the other, and more
specifically to semi-solid lubricants, commonly called
greases.More particularly the invention relates to mineral or
synthetic greases showing improved properties.It is well known that liquid, semi-solid and solid lubricants
are used for decreasing the friction between mechanical
parts moving one with respect to the other.As lubricants are commonly used products of the group
of mineral or synthetic oils and greases having an hydrogenated
basis. With mechanical members where lubricants are
difficult to feed continuously from the outside, a semi-solid
lubricant, that is a grease, is generally used.Grease is thixotropic, therefore fluid when in the state
of motion, and is suited, therefore, for lubrication of
members difficult for the liquid lubricant to be applied to;
grease has moreover the advantage of simplifying the hermetic
sealing of the member to be lubricated.The preparation of a grease consists in mixing a base 
oil with a thickening charge, optionally also with additives.
As base oil, a mineral or synthetic lubricant is mainly
used.
As thickening charge, metallic soaps, polyureas or non-soaps
such as for instance bentonite can be used.Greases prepared with these oils are low-cost, but can
be used in a limited temperature range, generally up to
about 150°C.The drawbacks shown by mineral and synthetic greases
can therefore be summarized as follows:
not high working maximum temperature, above which
greases become thermally unstable especially in the
presence of an oxidizing environment;once the working temperature has been set, the utilization
time of these greases is however limited.An essential parameter to establish the elevated durability
of a grease at the working temperature, is the evaporation
of the oil and above all the separation of the oil
from the solid phase formed by the thickening charge.A basic operation in preparing greases is in fact the
so-called homogenizing phase of the mineral oil with the
thickening charge.The more homogeneously the mineral oil disperses in
the thickening agent, the slower is its separation and therefore 
the greater is the grease durability.The essential parameter regulating homogenization and
then separation is the compatibility of the oil with the
thickening charge.It is known in the art to add stabilizers and antioxidants
to try to increase the chemical, thermal and thermooxidative
stability of the grease and to decrease the separation
of the
