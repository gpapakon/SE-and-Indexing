<ABSTRACT>
A polyester film contains a polyester having an intrinsic viscosity 
(IV) in the range from 0.65 to 0.8 and an antioxidant. The polyester 

has an endothermic high temperature peak at a temperature of (A)°C and 
an endothermic low temperature peak at a temperature of (B)°C, both 

peaks being measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the 
value of (A - B) is in the range from 25°C to 50°C. The polyester film 

is suitable for use an insulation film, exhibiting improved ageing 
properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyester film, and in particular to a film for
use as an electrical insulator.Polyester films, particularly polyethylene terephthalate, have been used
in industrial applications such as electrical applications, where the films operate
as insulator materials, eg in electric motors and electric capacitors. In such
electrical applications, the polyester films are subject to relatively high
temperatures for long periods of time. Unfortunately, commercially available
polyester films are susceptible to thermal ageing which can result in an
unacceptable reduction in the efficiency of the films as electrical insulators.
Thus, there is a commercial need for polyester films exhibiting improved thermal
ageing characteristics.However, improvements in thermal ageing can result in polyester films
displaying an increased tendency to delaminate in-plane, when used as
electrical insulators. Ideally, polyester films possessing improved thermal
ageing, which are not susceptible to in-plane delamination are required.Polyester films are known to contain relatively small amounts of low
molecular weight materials, or oligomers. The oligomers are extracted from the
polyester film, for example when used to insulate sealed motors, and can cause
problems by being deposited elsewhere in the system.FR-A-2679238 discloses a specific copolyester formed mainly of
terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, but containing 0.5 to 3.0 mol % of
isophthalic acid and 1.0 to 2.5 mol % of diethylene glycol. The polyester
contains less than 0.40% by weight of cyclic trimer and is suitable for forming a
hollow container therefrom.WO-A-93/04111 is directed to an amorphous and non-oriented
copolyester film formed from at least 80 mol % of terephthalic acid and 90 mol
% of 1,4-cyclo-hexanedimethanol. The film contains a hindered phenolic
antioxidant and is suitable for forming an ovenable tray.JP-A-4-275340 and JP-A-4-316829 both disclose a polyester film having
low shrinkage characteristics. The film described in both of the documents is
defined in terms of two or more endothermic peaks, which do not include the
melting peak.We have now devised a polyester film which reduces or substantially
overcomes one or more of the aforementioned problems.Accordingly, the present invention provides a polyester film comprising a
polyester having an intrinsic viscosity (IV), measured by solution viscometry
using a 1% by weight solution of polyester in o-chlorophenol at 25°C, in the 
range from 0.65 to 0.8, and an effective amount of an
