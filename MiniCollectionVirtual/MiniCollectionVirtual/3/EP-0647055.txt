<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a telephone 
billing management method for cellular telephones. The 

objective is to provide the user of a cellular telephone a 
cost accounting and management tool. The amounts of 

various classes of service used in the current billing 
period are downloaded and displayed at the user phone 

terminal, for instance on the wireless handset. 
Specifically, cumulative billing information for the 

present billing period is downloaded and displayed at the 
user's location during the call set up-period signalling 

period. The charge rate for the current call can also be 
downloaded. Once the call is stabilized, the duration 

(air time) and cost of the present call can be calculated 
and displayed in real time. Thus, for management 

purposes, the user has access to the provider's 
information on all charges up to the present call and the 

duration and cost of the present call can be calculated 
and displayed in real-time without further burden on the 

provider.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
Application Serial No. 08/130,964, filed on October 4, 
1993. The present invention is directed to a telephone 
billing management method for cellular telephones. 
Specifically, during the call set up signalling period, 
cumulative billing information for the present billing 
period is downloaded and displayed at the user's location 
and duration and cost of the present call is calculated 
and displayed. U.S. Patent No. 3,769,463 issued October 30, 1973 
to Graham et al teaches an electronic long distance 
telephone call computer and recorder for computing elapsed 
time and charges for a particular call as well as means 
for calculating a cumulative total of charges. General 
operation of the Graham apparatus requires first 
ascertaining from a chart the regular and overtime charges 
for the call to be made and programming that information 
into the apparatus. No such set-up on the part of the 
user is necessary with the present invention. U.S. Patent No. 4,091,238 issued May 23, 1978 to 
Samuels et al. teaches an apparatus which calculates and 
displays the accrued cost of a telephone call capable of 
taking into account local and long distance call rates, 
message unit areas, etc. U.S. Patent No. 5,109,401 teaches a radio 
telecommunication device for use in an automobile radio  
 
communication apparatus (mobile cellular phone) capable of 
informing a user when a call charge for one call exceeds a 
preset call charge and which is also capable of stopping 
speech communication when such preset call charge has been 
exceeded and which is also capable of informing a user 
when an accumulated call charge for a plurality of calls 
exceeds a cumulative preset call charge. U.S. Patent No. 5,134,651 issued July 28, 1992 to 
Ortiz et al teaches a pay telephone arrangement for a 
mobile phone wherein charges for a particular call are 
displayed to an owner and a user so that the call can be 
paid for immediately by the customer. None of the prior art cited downloads the 
provider's cumulative billing information for the current 
billing period during the call set up signalling period 
before the present call is stabilized as does the present 
invention. The present invention method provides more 
foresight and manageability to the subscriber than prior 
art methods. The present invention is directed to a telephone 
billing management system method for cellular telephones. 
The objective is to provide the user of a cellular 
telephone a cost accounting and

<CLAIMS>
A telephone billing management system method 
for a cellular telephone system having at least one 

provider with a real-time node computer and a plurality of 
user phone terminals with display units comprising: 

   preprogramming said provider's real-time node 
computer to download cumulative current billing period 

information and transmit via cellular radio 
telecommunication channels said information to at least 

one of said user phone terminals during a two-way call 
signalling set-up period initiated by a user when 

beginning a current call; 
   preprogramming said user phone terminal to 

receive and display said current billing period 

information; 
   downloading and transmitting from said provider's 

real-time node computer said cumulative current billing 
period information to said user phone terminal during said 

two-way call set-up period via said cellular radio 
telecommunications channels; and, 

   displaying said current billing period 
information on said display unit. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said step of 
preprogramming said real-time node computer further 

includes preprogramming said computer to download and 
transmit charge rate information for said current call, 

and said step of programming said user phone terminal 
includes preprogramming said phone terminal to receive and 

displaying said charge rate information for said current 
call on said display unit. 
The method of claim 2, wherein said step of 
preprogramming said user phone terminal further includes 

preprogramming said user phone terminal to calculate and 
 

display air time and billing costs from said charge rate information for said current 
call, and further comprising calculating said air time and billing costs for said current 

call and displaying said air time and billing costs for said current call on said display 
unit. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said cumulative current billing 
period information is the amount of each grade of service used so far in said current 

billing period. 
The method of claim 2 or 3, wherein said charge rate information is a 
charge rate per minute for said current call. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said display unit is located on a 
handset of said user phone terminal. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said display unit is located on a cradle 
housing of said user phone terminal. 
The method of claim 1, 6 or 7, wherein said display unit is a digital 
display unit. 
The method of claim 8, wherein said digital display unit is an L.E.D. 
display unit.
