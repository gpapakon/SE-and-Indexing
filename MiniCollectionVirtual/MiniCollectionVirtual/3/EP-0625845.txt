<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ciphering device and 
a ciphering method in a facsimile. In a facsimile, an image signal read is coded by MH 
(modified Huffman) coding, MR (Modified READ) coding or the 
like and then, is transmitted. In the facsimile, it is 
considered that a coded signal is further ciphered and 
transmitted so that the original image signal is not 
deciphered from the transmitted signal. Ciphering 
processing is generally performed in units of n bits, 
whereby an n-bit signal is converted into an n-bit ciphered 
signal. In the facsimile employing MH coding, MR coding or the 
like, the following control codes are added to the coded 
signal. Specifically, an end-of-line (EOL) code is added 
behind the coded signal on each scanning line. The EOL code 
is 12-bit data "000000000001".  Furthermore, if the signal transmission time per 
scanning line is smaller than the minimum time determined by 
CCITT, a required number of "0" bits are added just ahead of 
the EOL code. A code added just ahead of the EOL code shall 
be referred to as a FILL code. Additionally, a return-to-control (RTC) code is added 
behind one telegraphic message before transmission. This 
RTC code is a sequence of six EOL codes "000000000001". 
That is, a predetermined pattern of 12 x 6 = 72 bits is 
added behind one telegraphic message. Suppose a signal obtained by adding the control code 
comprising the EOL code, the FILL code and the RTC code to 
the coded signal is ciphered in units of n bits. If the number of bits composing a signal to be ciphered 
(a plaintext) comprising the coded signal and the control 
code added thereto is not a multiple of n, it is considered 
that "0s" whose number corresponds to the number of bits 
which is short of a multiple of n is added. If the number of bits which is short of a multiple of n 
is increased, however, the contents of the last n bits of 
the signal to be ciphered are estimated. For example, if n 
= 100 and the number of bits which is short of a multiple of 
n is not less than 38 (= 100 - 72), the last n bits of the 
signal to be ciphered is constituted by the EOL code and a 
plurality of "0" bits, whereby the contents of the last n 
 
bits of the signal to be ciphered are estimated. 
Consequently, a cipher rule is easily found on the basis of 
the last n bits of the signal to be ciphered and a 
corresponding ciphertext, so that the ciphertext is easily 
deciphered. On the other hand, merely by ciphering the signal to be 
ciphered comprising the coded signal and the control
