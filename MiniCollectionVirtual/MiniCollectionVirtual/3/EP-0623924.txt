<ABSTRACT>
A loader for data carriers, such as magnetic tape cartridges, of the type having a 
housing with a data reader therein which is movable over a magazine containing a 

number of data carriers, so as to be positionable above a selected data carrier for 
transfer between the magazine and the data reader, has a drawer which carries the 

magazine and which is slidable into and out of the loader housing. A drive motor is 
contained in the housing for moving the data reader over the drawer, and the reader 

carries transfer assemblies, such as roller-driven belts, to effect the transfer of the data 
carriers between the magazine and the reader. The drawer has engagement elements 

mounted thereon which can engage the transfer assemblies, so that the same motor 
which is used to move the data reader over the drawer can be used to slide the drawer 

into and out of the loader housing, when the transfer assemblies are engaged with the 
engagement elements. The loader housing may be formed by a single extruded tube, 

with interior glide elements thereon on which the data reader and the drawer are 
respectively movably mounted by roller assemblies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to loaders for data carriers, and in particular to 
a loader of the type wherein a magazine containing a plurality of data carriers is inserted 
into a loader housing, and a data reader is moved over the magazine to select a data 
carrier therefrom for insertion into the reader. It is known to record and store data on a number of different types of storage 
media, such as magnetic tape, optical disks and the like. Because of the limited size of 
such data carriers, the amount of data which can be stored thereon is similarly limited. 
In computing and data retrieval systems wherein a large amount of data is stored, a 
relatively large number of such data carriers are required in order to contain all of the 
necessary data. To retrieve the data from the data carrier, it is necessary to insert the 
carrier into a data reader, such as a tape drive unit. (As used herein, the unit into which 
the data carrier is inserted will be referred to as a "reader," although it may also be used 
for the purpose of writing data on the carrier.)  
 In systems requiring multiple data carriers, it is cumbersome 
to manually successively insert and remove the data carriers 
from the reader. Many such systems, therefore, employ a data 
carrier magazine, which holds a large number of data carriers, 
with the magazine being loadable into a device which contains 
the reader. A selected data carrier can then be automatically 
removed from the magazine, and automatically inserted into the 
reader wherein the data on the carrier is read, or new data is 
written on the carrier. After completion of the read or write 
operation, the data carrier is then automatically removed from 
the reader and is replaced in the magazine. The overall unit, 
which includes the magazine, the data reader, and an automated 
mechanism for removing the data carrier from the magazine, 
inserting it into the reader, and removing it from the reader 
and replacing it in the magazine, is generically known as a 
"loader". Loaders can generally be classified into three 
types: those in which the magazine is stationary in the loader 
and the drive is moved over the magazine to the position of a 
selected data carrier in the magazine, those wherein the 
reader is stationary and the magazine is moved to position a 
selected data carrier at a location for insertion in the 
reader, and those wherein both the magazine and reader are 
stationary, and an "elevator" or other type of data carrier 
transfer mechanism is used to move the

<CLAIMS>
A data carrier loader, comprising: 

a housing (2); 
a drawer (4) slidable into and out of said housing 
(2) in a longitudinal direction and having a region 

(5) adapted to removably hold a plurality of data 
carriers (8); 
a data reader (10) supported in said housing (2); 
transfer means (11; 12, 19, 20) for transferring a 
data carrier (8) between said drawer (4) and said 

data reader (10); 
 
characterized in that 


said data reader (10) is movably supported above said 
drawer (4) when said drawer (4) is in said housing (2); 
reader positioning drive means (13, 14) for moving said 
data reader (10) over said drawer (4) in said housing 

(2) to a selected location along said longitudinal 
direction are provided; 
said transfer means (11; 12, 19, 20) are carried by said 
data reader (10); and 
engagement means (9) are mounted at a rear of said 
drawer (4) for engaging said transfer means (11) and for 

sliding said drawer (4) into and out of said housing (2) 
using said reader positioning drive means (13, 14). 
A data carrier loader as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
transfer means comprises two transfer assemblies (11) 

respectively mounted at opposite sides of said data 
reader (10) and disposed above opposite sides of said 

drawer (4). 
A data carrier loader as claimed in claim 2 wherein each 
transfer assembly (11) comprises: 


a transfer assembly plate (18), first and second wheels 
(19, 20) rotatably mounted on said transfer assembly 

plate (18); 
a belt (12) entrained around said wheels (19, 20); and 
means for rotating one of said wheels for moving said 
belt. 
A data carrier loader as claimed in claim 2 wherein each 
of said assemblies (11) has a free end, and wherein said 

engagement means comprises two engagement elements (9) 
respectively mounted at opposite sides of said drawer 

(4), each engagement element (9) having an opening (33) 
therein adapted to receive the free end of one of said 

assemblies (11). 
A data carrier loader as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
housing comprises a front panel (29), a rear panel (28), 

and a single extruded tube (2) forming sides, a top and 
a bottom of said loader (1) and attached to said front 

and rear panels (29, 28). 
A data carrier loader as claimed in claim 5 wherein said 
single extruded tube (2) has upper and lower glide rails 

(24) extending into the interior of said housing and  
 

extruded as part of said tube (2), and wherein said data 
reader (10) has a pair of roller assemblies (27) 

respectively engaging said upper glide rails (24) and 
wherein said drawer (4) has at least a pair of roller
