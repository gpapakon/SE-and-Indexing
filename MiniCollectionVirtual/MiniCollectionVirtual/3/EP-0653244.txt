<ABSTRACT>
An eccentric vibrating mill having at least one grinding container (1) which is mounted on vibrating elements and to which the exciter unit (2) is rigidly attached as a vibrating drive, and in which, to improve the grinding characteristics of conventional vibrating mills, provision is made according to the invention for the excitation of the grinding container to take place eccentrically on one side, i.e. outside the axis of the centre of gravity and the centre-point of the mass of the grinding container, a compensating mass (8) being provided to compensate the exciter mass, and the drive-side spring axis lying between the axes of the centre of gravity of the grinding container and the exciter unit, and the exciter unit being operated in such a way that inhomogeneous vibrations are produced, consisting of circular, elliptical and linear vibrations.

<CLAIMS>
Eccentric vibrating mill with at least one grinding
container (1) which is mounted on vibrating elements

and to which the exciter unit is rigidly attached as
vibrating drive, characterized in that the grinding

container (1) is excited eccentrically on one side,
i.e. outside the gravity axis and the mass centre of

the grinding container (1), whereby a balancing mass
(8) is provided For balancing the exciter mass and the

spring axis on the drive side lies between the gravity
axes of the grinding container (1) and the exciter unit

(2, 9, 2a, 2b) and the exciter unit (2, 9, 2a, 2b) is
operated in such a way that inhomogeneous vibrations

consisting of circular, elliptical and linear
vibrations are produced.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the distance from the axis of the

exciter unit (2, 9, 2a, 2b) parallel to the axis of the
grinding container is greater than the smallest

distance from the grinding container centre to the
grinding container's inner wall.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the exciter unit comprises two or

more exciters.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the grinding container (1)

is excited with the help of one exciter or several
exciters (to be synchronized) lying one behind the

other on an axis which is parallel to the axis of the
grinding container. 
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the grinding container (1)

is excited with the help of several exciters (to be
synchronized) located one above the other and parallel

to the axis of the grinding container.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the exciters are preferably

unbalance motors.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that it comprises several

grinding container/exciter unit modules located one
behind the other.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 7, characterized in that it comprises one or more

grinding containers located parallel to the axis of the
mill.
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the grinding container is

preferably a grinding tube (1).
Eccentric vibrating mill according to one of Claims 1
to 9, characterized in that a chamber wheel (20) is

located in the grinding container (1).
Eccentric vibrating mill according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the balancing mass is arranged

parallel to the axis on the side of the grinding
container (1) lying opposite the exciter unit (2, 9,

2a, 2b).
