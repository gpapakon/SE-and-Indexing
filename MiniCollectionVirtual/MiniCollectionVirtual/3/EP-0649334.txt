<ABSTRACT>
Filters for filtering molten light metals comprise a reticular foam formed from a composition comprising graphite, wollastonite, silica and a borosilicate glass and consist of a crystalline phase comprising graphite and wollastonite dispersed in a substantially amorphous matrix of borosilicate glass. The filters can readily be machined accurately from large pieces of the filter material and they do not pick up moisture from the atmosphere when stored. The borosilicate glass used to produce the filters preferably has a softening temperature (T1) in the range of 600  DEG C, more preferably 650  DEG C to 900  DEG C and a melting temperature (T2) in the range of 700  DEG C to 1100  DEG C, as measured according to the tests in German Standard DIN 51730.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filters for 
filtering light metals, by which term is to be 
understood aluminium, magnesium, alloys of these two 
metals, and alloys of either or both of these metals 
with other metals in which alloys, aluminium and/or 
magnesium predominate. In particular the invention 
relates to filters of relatively small size for use in 
dies for the gravity diecasting of aluminium or 
aluminium alloys. It is well known to use open-cell ceramic 
foams to filter molten light metals. Such ceramic foam 
filters are generally made by impregnating an organic 
foam, usually polyurethane foam, with an aqueous slurry 
containing the material which is to form the filter and 
a binder, removing excess slurry, drying to remove 
water, and firing the dried impregnated foam to burn 
off the organic foam to form a ceramic foam. Using the above method of manufacture 
individual filters are produced of the required shape 
and size, or alternatively a large piece of ceramic 
foam is produced and cut or machined to form individual 
filters. Both methods of manufacture suffer from 
disadvantages. When individual filters of a given nominal 
size are produced directly from organic foam of a 
similar size to the filters their dimensional variation 
is such that problems arise in use, particularly in the 
gravity die casting of aluminium and its alloys, in 
which the filter is inserted in a recess in the die. 
As oversize filters cannot be used because they cannot  
 
be inserted in the recess it is common practice to 
compensate for the dimensional variations by 
deliberately making the filter slightly too small for 
the size of the recess. As a result small gaps remain 
between the edge of the filter and the wall of the 
recess, and because metal can penetrate through the 
gaps and bypass the filter, filtration efficiency is 
reduced. If the filter is loose, crushing of the 
filter can occur when the die is closed and this can 
lead to particles of ceramic material from the filter 
passing through the filter, and into the casting cavity 
of the die, thus resulting in inclusions in the 
casting. When individual filters are produced from 
large pieces of ceramic foam by cutting or machining, 
manufacturing costs are high and productivity rates 
low, due to the nature of the materials from which the 
filters have hitherto been made. As the materials are 
brittle fracture of the foam tends to occur when the 
foam is cut or machined. US Patent 3524548 describes a rigid, porous, 
filter medium for molten aluminium
