<DESCRIPTION>
This invention belongs to the fields of pharmaceutical
chemistry and pharmacological treatment, and provides a new
method of treating incontinence in humans, making use of a
series of 3-aryloxypropanamines, particularly duloxetine.Urinary incontinence is a common condition, and often
is so severe as to constitute an embarrassing and even disabling
difficulty. It is a frequent cause of elderly people's
confinement to nursing homes and other protected environments.
While it is more common among women than among men, at all ages,
it afflicts significant numbers of both sexes. It is well known
that many children past the usual age of toilet-training suffer
from nocturnal enuresis, and less frequently from daytime
urinary incontinence, and it is also well known that the elderly
are quite-likely to develop urinary incontinence as they grow
older. However, some studies have reported daily incontinence
among as many as 17% of young, apparently healthy, women.Thus, it is clear that reliable and safe methods of
treating urinary incontinence are seriously needed. The need is
not, at present, adequately met.Urinary incontinence is a manifestation of the failure
of control of the muscles of the urinary sphincter and of the
bladder. Those muscles are in balance, when the system is
operating properly. The urinary sphincter should be
sufficiently strong to hold back the pressure exerted by the
muscles of the bladder, except when the subject consciously
relaxes the sphincter in order to urinate.Incontinence results when the pressure within the
bladder is too great, as a result of excessive force exerted by
the muscles of the bladder, or when the urinary sphincter is too
weak to hold back the normal intra-bladder pressure. 
Incontinence is broadly classified as urge incontinence (caused
by excessive intra-bladder pressure), and stress incontinence
(caused by a weak urethral sphincter). Patients often are seen
with both urge and stress incontinence, a condition which is
called mixed incontinence.Urinary incontinence, appearing in different types of
patients, has a number of different causes or apparent causes,
including Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, cerebral vascular
system damage, cerebral arteriosclerosis, lesions of the central
nervous system, and infections of the bladder. Instability of
the muscles of the bladder or urethra can have many causes, and
interstitial cystitis can result in instability of the bladder
detrusor muscles and result in a particularly painful and
unpleasant variety of urge
