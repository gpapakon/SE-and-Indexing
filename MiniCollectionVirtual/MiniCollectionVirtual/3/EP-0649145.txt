<ABSTRACT>
Described is a wiring topology and hierarchy of transmission line 
impedances for connecting I/O of semiconductor devices 12 together. This 

arrangement gives smooth signal shapes for signal rise and fall times as 
fast as one (1) nsec or faster. The design uses a balanced multi-way 

branched net with increasing impedance until very close to the end of the 
net, where it is a balanced multi-way branched net with unterminated 

ends. Thus, coming out of the signal driver 34 is a single impedance 
transmission line 36. This single impedance transmission line then 

branches 37 into two impedance transmission lines 38, each having an 
impedance higher than the single line impedance that feeds it. These 

lines 38 are used to drive electronic modules 30. After entering the 
electronic modules 30 through a connector 39, each of these lines 38 then 

branch into two transmission lines 40 having a yet higher impedance 
value. Each of these lines 40 finally ends in a cluster of four 

transmission lines 42. Each of these final lines 42 connects to 
electronic devices 12 on the electronic module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data processing systems, and more 
particularly to an improved method and apparatus for interconnection 
between electrical and electronic devices to improve signal propagation 
and quality. Electronic cards used within a data processing system require 
precise control of address, data and control signals (and in some cases 
clocks) for optimal performance. These signals are generated by 
electronic devices (e.g. semiconductor chips) accessing the contents of 
other semiconductor devices (e.g. memory chips) contained on the 
electronic cards. As the rise and fall times of these generated signals 
decreases to one (1) nanosecond (nsec) and below, the arrangement of 
circuit board traces and semiconductor devices on the electronic card 
strongly influences the shape of the signal presented to the 
semiconductor device. In most arrangements, the sharply changing 
voltages cause severe fluctuations on the signals as received by the 
semiconductor devices. The fluctuations can result in improper access to 
stored data, for example, causing errors in high speed computers, or 
resulting in lower performance. The root cause of these signal fluctuations can usually be traced 
to the reflections of the signal pulses at the ends of the unterminated 
circuit board lines. The inductances and capacitances of the modules and 
connectors in the system can also contribute to the fluctuations, as well 
as mismatches between the impedances of the signal drivers and the signal 
traces. It is known that these fluctuations can be reduced by proper 
resistive termination of the circuit lines of the memory card, but this 
results in very large and undesirable power dissipation. Other attempts at improving signal quality in high speed data 
processing systems are focussed on designs that minimize wire lengths. 
However, these types of designs are problematic in that the total path 
lengths from driver to (multiple) receivers are still longer than the  
 
signal rise times, and thus reflections from impedance discontinuities 
generally give rise to undesired signal distortions at the receiver(s). The present invention provides an improved wiring topology and 
hierarchy of transmission line impedances for connecting common I/O of 
semiconductor devices together. The design is particularly useful for 
net topologies having a source (a driver) and multiple destinations 
(receivers). This arrangement gives smooth signal shapes for signal rise 
and fall times as fast as one (1) nsec or faster. The
