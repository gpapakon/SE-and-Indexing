<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the invention is to obtain a process for operating a permanently excited single-phase alternating current machine which allows optimal exploitation of the machine and economical design of the converter. The process of the invention is characterized in that the effective value of a phase current i of the alternating current machine at maximum torque can be minimized by impressing certain shapes of a terminal voltage u, using a converter. The optimal voltage shape, e.g., sinusoidal, square wave or mixed, is chosen in function of the operating range of the machine. The process of the invention makes it possible for the first time to use a converter of economical design to supply a permanently excited single-phase alternating current machine, such as a transverse flux machine, and in so doing to turn all the advantages of this machine to account in a wide range of applications.

Method for controlling a magnetoelectric single-phase transverse-flux motor by means
of a converter, characterized in that the converter impresses a terminal voltage (u) which

is computed from the rotational angle (ϕ) of the transverse-flux motor, the angular
frequency (ω), an individually preselected torque (m
soll
) and an available intermediate
circuit DC voltage (+U
ZK
 or -U
ZK
), the terminal voltage (u) having sinusoidal components
and regions between computed first and second switching points (δ-Δ, δ+Δ) within which

the terminal voltage (u) assumes the value of the intermediate circuit DC voltage (U
ZK
) in
order to minimize the root-mean-square value of the phase current (i) of the

transverse-flux motor at maximum torque.
Circuit arrangement for carrying out the method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a measured value for the rotational angle (ϕ) of the transverse-flux motor (5), the

angular frequency (ω) which forms a differentiating control system element (6) from the
rotational angle (ϕ), the individually preselected torque (m
soll
) and the available
intermediate circuit DC voltage (U
ZK
) are able to be respectively fed to a first and second
control device (1, 2), in that the first control device (1) computes switching points (δ-Δ,

δ+Δ) for changeover to the intermediate circuit DC voltage (+U
Zk
 or -U
Zk
) according to
the polarity of the voltage within the half-period and retransmits these switching points

(δ-Δ, δ+Δ) to a control set (3) of the converter (4), and in that the second control device
(2) forms a required terminal voltage and feeds it to the control set (3) of the converter (4).
