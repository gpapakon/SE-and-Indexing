<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of a reinforcing fabric for articles made
from rubber, such as pneumatic tyres, conveyor belts, flexible tubes,

and similar, comprising a plurality of metal cords (1) orientated
parallel to each other in a single direction and in which each cord

comprises metal wires (4) wound spirally around each other, wherein at
least one (3) of the wires of the cord consists of a shape memory

material.
During the phase of incorporation of the cords (1) into the
elastomeri
c material, the shape memory wire (3) tends to recover the
shape memorized initially and, by means of the force generated during

this recovery, transmits by friction to the surrounding wires (4) forces
tending to shorten the pitch of the cord (1) with spacing of each wire

(4) from the next, resulting in good penetration of elastomeric material
between the wires (4). The closure of the cord (1) is maintained in the

subsequent heat cycles, owing to the memory degradation characteristics
imparted to the wire.
The invention is particularly suitable for
fabrics forming belt layers and casing plies in pneumatic tyres.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to articles made from
elastomeric material, particularly pneumatic tyres,
reinforced with rubberized fabrics comprising cords with at
least one shape memory wire; and also to the said fabrics
and to the corresponding cords.The invention also relates to a process for the
manufacture of these rubberized fabrics.Many articles made from elastomeric materials,
including pneumatic tyres for vehicle wheels, conveyor
belts, flexible hoses for the transport of fluids and
similar, comprise at least one rubberized fabric formed by
a plurality of reinforcing cords, normally textile or
metal, disposed parallel to each other and incorporated in
an elastomeric material.In the following part of the present description, the
wording "elastomeric material" is intended to denote the
composition of the incorporating material as a whole, in
other words the rubber, including the polymer base, the
reinforcing fillers and the various protective,
accelerating, anti-ageing and other agents, the whole
according to recipes which are well known to those skilled
in the art.It is also known that metal cords are formed from a
plurality of single metal wires wound spirally with respect
to each other, with predetermined intervals, according to a
plurality of configurations which are well known to those
skilled in the art.In general, the cited articles require cords having
particular characteristics of mechanical strength when
exposed to various stresses, including tensile and
compressive stresses, and having corrosion resistance.
Corrosion may be initiated in the metal wires of the cord
by the presence of moisture in the residual air inside the 
cords incorporated in the rubber, or by direct contact with
water when the breaking of the rubber layer exposes the
cord to the external environment.Once initiated, the corrosion may be propagated along
the wires in the absence of a suitable protective coating
of the wires.To meet the requirement of corrosion resistance, it is
convenient for the space between the metal wires of the
cord to be completely filled with rubber to avoid the
presence of air incorporated between the wires and
subsequent formation of moisture with consequent
development and propagation of the corrosion phenomenon.Additionally, in order to resist mechanical stresses,
the wires of the cords must be closely associated with each
other in order to ensure correct behaviour in operation, as
represented graphically, in a Cartesian stress-strain
diagram, by a substantially linear characteristic.In
