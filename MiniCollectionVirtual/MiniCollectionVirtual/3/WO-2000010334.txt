<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for allocating resources for a data transmission connection between a wireless communication device and a mobile communication network. In the method, the information to be transmitted is divided into at least a first and a second quality of service class. For the data transmission connection, either a fixed resource or a dynamic resource is allocated on the basis of the quality of service class in which the information to be transmitted in the data transmission connection is classified.

<DESCRIPTION>
Resource allocation in packet-format data transmissionThe present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of the appended claim 1 , a communication device according to the preamble of the appended claim 7, and a communication system according to the preamble of the appended claim 10.The term "wireless communication system" refers generally to any communication system which enables wireless communication between a wireless communication device (MS) and the fixed parts of the system, when the user of the wireless communication device is moving within the service area of the system. A typical wireless communication system is a public land mobile network PLMN. The majority of wireless communication systems in use at the time of filing this application belong to so-called second generation mobile communication systems, of which the widely known GSM mobile communication system (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) can be mentioned as an example. The present invention is especially well applicable to third generation mobile communication systems currently under development. In this specification, a GPRS system (General Packet Radio Service) which is being standardized at present, will be used as an example of such a mobile communication system. It is obvious that the invention is also applicable in other mobile communication systems, in which it is possible to define different quality of service levels, or the like, for a data transmission connection.The GPRS system defines the concept of bearer services. Generally it corresponds to the communication channel of prior systems, which is used to define e.g. a user data rate and quality of service (QoS), both provided by the system in the data transmission between a wireless communication device and some other part of the mobile communication network.One of the most difficult functions of the bearer services is to provide a sufficient quality of service level reliably for each user. The general packet radio service GPRS is a new service under development for theGSM mobile communication system. The functional environment of the 

GPRS system comprises one or more subnetwork service areas, which are connected to form a GPRS backbone network. The subnetwork comprises numerous support nodes (SN), of which serving GPRS support nodes (SGSN) will be used as an example in this specification. The serving GPRS support nodes are connected to the mobile communication network (typically to a base station via an interface unit) in such a way that they

Claims:
1. A method for allocating resources for a data transmission connection between a wireless communication device and a mobile communication network, in which method the information to be transmitted is divided into at least a first and a second quality of service class, characterized in that either a fixed resource or a dynamic resource is allocated for the data transmission connection, on the basis of the quality of service class in which the information to be transmitted in the data transmission connection is classified.
2. The method according to claim 1 , characterized in that the information to be transmitted is processed according to a protocol stack which contains at least an LLC layer and an RLC/MAC layer, that one RLC block (209, 210) is provided in the RLC/MAC layer for processing each item of information classified into such a quality of service class for which a fixed resource is allocated, and that one common RLC block (211) is provided for processing information classified into all the other quality of service classes.
3. The method according to claim 2, characterized in that information is transmitted in packets, and each quality of service class is provided with one LLE block (205, 206, 207, 208) for processing packets, wherein data packets coming from the upper layers of the protocol stack to the LLC layer are divided into different LLE blocks (205, 206, 207, 208) on the basis of the quality of service requirements defined for each packet.
4. The method according to claim 1 , 2, or 3, characterized in that the wireless communication device (MS) identifies the quality of service class in the mobile communication network.
5. The method according to claim 4, characterized in that an LLC service access point (201 , 202, 203, 204) identifier is attached to each quality of service class, wherein identification is performed by transmitting an LLC service access point (201 , 202, 203, 204) identifier (LLC-SAPI). 

6. The method according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a fixed resource allocation is performed for such data transmission connections in which data transmission is performed substantially in real time.
7. A communication device for processing and transmitting information to be transmitted in packet form in one or more data transmission connections, the information being arranged to be divided into at least a first and a second quality of service class, characterized in that the communication device comprises means (209, 210, 211) for allocating resources for each said data transmission connection on the basis of the quality of service class in which the information to be transmitted in the data transmission connection is classified, wherein the means for allocating resources comprise means (209, 210) for fixed resource allocation and means (211) for dynamic resource allocation.
8. The communication device according to claim 7, characterized in that it comprises means for processing information according to a protocol stack, which contains at least an LLC layer and an RLC/MAC layer, and that the means (209, 210) for fixed resource allocation and the means (211) for dynamic resource allocation are established in the RLC/MAC layer.
9. The communication device according to claim 8, characterized in that it comprises means for identifying a quality of service class in the mobile communication network.
