<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods for screening drug compounds utilizing compounds of formulas (I and II), and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof where: R1, R2, R3, and R4 represent hydrogen, halogen, alkyl or alkoxy substituents; R5 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; X and Y represent hydrogen, halogen, alkyl or alkoxy substituents; and Z is hydrogen or fluorine. The invention also provides tritium or iodine isotope radiolabeled compounds of the formulas (I and II) radiolabeled with tritium or isotopes of iodine. The invention further provides novel GABAa receptor subtypes which specifically bind to compounds of formulas (I or II). The invention also provides GABAa receptor subtypes which are bound in situ to a compound of formula (I or II). The compounds provided herein bind selectively to a novel subtype of the GABAa binding site. Selective interaction of ligands at this unique receptor population results in pharmacological specificity which may lead to superior anxiolytics, cognition enhancers, anticonvulsants and sedative hypnotics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for screening drug compounds that 
bind to GABAa receptors. More specifically, it relates to the use of 
imidazoquinoxalines and imidazopyrimidines in such drug screening methods. 
It further relates to novel GABAa receptor subtypes which bind certain 
imidazoquinoxalines and imidazopyrimidines. Î³-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is regarded as one of the major inhibitory 
amino acid transmitters in the mammalian brain. Forty years have elapsed 
since its presence in the brain was demonstrated (Roberts & Frankel, J. Biol. 
Chem 187: 55-63, 1950; Udenfriend, J. Biol. Chem. 187: 65-69, 1950). Since that 
time, an enormous amount of effort has been devoted to implicating GABA in 
the etiology of seizure disorders, sleep, anxiety and cognition (Tallman and 
Gallager, Ann. Rev. Neuroscience 8: 21-44, 1985). Widely, although unequally, 
distributed through the mammalian brain. GABA is said to be a transmitter at 
approximately 30% of the synapses in the brain. In most regions of the brain, 
GABA is associated with local inhibitory neurons and only in two regions is 
GABA associated with longer projections. GABA mediates many of its actions 
through a complex of proteins localized both on cell bodies and nerve endings: 
these are called GABAa receptors. Postsynaptic responses to GABA are mediated 
through alterations in chloride conductance that generally, although not 
invariably. lead to hyperpolarization of the cell. Recent investigations have 
indicated that the complex of proteins associated with postsynaptic GABA 
responses is a major site of action for a number of structurally unrelated 
compounds capable of modifying postsynaptic responses to GABA. Depending 
on the mode of interaction, these compounds are capable of producing a 
spectrum of activities (either sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant, or 
wakefulness, seizures, and anxiety). 1,4-Benzodiazepines continue to be among the most widely used drugs in 
the world. Principal among the benzodiazepines marketed are 
chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, flurazepam, and triazolam. These compounds are 
widely used as anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and 
anticonvulsants. A number of these compounds are extremely potent drugs: 
such potency indicates a site of action with a high affinity and specificity for  
 
individual receptors. Early electrophysiological studies indicated that a major 
action of benzodiazepines was enhancement of GABAergic inhibition. The 
benzodiazepines were capable of enhancing presynaptic

A method of drug screening comprising the steps of: 

(a) adding flumazenil to a preparation containing GABAa 
receptors thereby to allow flumazenil to bind to GABAa 

receptors; 
(b) thereafter utilizing the resulting treated preparation 
in a reaction mixture for conducting a competition 

reaction between a radiolabeled compound of formula (I) 
or (II) and the drug to be tested for remaining GABAa 

receptors, to which flumazenil has not bound but which 
have a specific binding site for a compound of formula I 

or II: 
(c) separating the GABAa receptor bound radiolabeled 
compound of formula I or II from the reaction mixture of 

step (b); and 
(d) measuring the radioactivity resulting from specific 
binding of the radiolabeled compound of formula I or II 

to the said remaining GABAa receptors,
