<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a series of hoses (1) connected together via tees (3) by quick-connection means (2, 4, 5). On the tees are mounted, by screwing, rigid tubes, or poles (10, 11), which have means (15) for spraying droplets at their opposite end. Holding means are used for holding the rigid tubes in the desired position, which is generally vertical. These means may include a support (7), arms (16) or a tripod (17) placed on the ground, or a foot (19) to be implanted in the ground, or magnets (21) mounted on the tube, to be fixed on a suitable metal object already existing.

A device for producing a cloud of droplets, this cloud occupying a volume 
above the ground, this device comprising a series of means (15) for spraying droplets 

located in a line above the ground, and hoses (1) connecting these spraying means to a 
source of liquid under pressure, characterized in that there are associated with each 

means for spraying droplets: 

a rigid tubular tee (3), exhibiting two opposite openings, communicating 
with each other and each provided with a cylindrical part equipped with an O-ring seal, 

and a third opening communicating with the other two and provided with a screw 
thread, 
two tubular end fittings (2) each mounted on one end of one of two 

different hoses (1), these end fittings being of a diameter calculated so that each can fit 
into one of the ends carrying the opposite openings of the tee, and interact, in the fitted-in 

arrangement, with the O-ring in order to give a sealed connection, 
collars (4), fitted on said tubular end fittings, and each carrying at least one 
hook (5) capable of coming into engagement with a corresponding relief in the tee, and 

an elastic means (6) capable of holding said hook in engagement, and thus provide a 
fixed, but removable, connection of the hose and the tee, 
a rigid tube (10, 11), one end of which is screw threaded and can be fitted, 
by screwing, onto the third opening of the tee, and the other end of which is rigidly 

coupled to the means (15) for spraying droplets and carries this means, 
means (7, 16 to 21) for keeping said rigid tube in a given position with 
respect to the ground. 
The device of Claim 1, characterized in that the means for keeping the rigid 
tube in its position comprise a rigid support (7, 16 to 19), connected to the tee, 

provided with means for anchoring to the ground, or simply resting on the ground.  
 
The device of Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the means for holding the 
rigid tube in its position comprise magnets (21), secured to the rigid tube and capable 

of keeping the latter bearing against an already existing suitable support (22) made of 
an appropriate metal. 
The device of any of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that a nonreturn valve 
(8) is interposed between the tee and the rigid tube and secured to these components by 

screwing. 
The device of any of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the tubes are made 
of a porous material intended to make them nonflammable. 
The device of any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it is further 
equipped with at least one solenoid valve (24) and with a member (25) for controlling 

the latter, the solenoid valve being placed between the source of liquid and at least one 
means (15) for spraying droplets, and the control member (25) being one which is 

triggered automatically or by remote control. 
Application of the device according to any of claims 1 to 6 to the protection 
of an industrial installation, such as a store of hazardous products. 
Application of the device according to any of claims 1 to 6 to the 
protection of forests against fire.
