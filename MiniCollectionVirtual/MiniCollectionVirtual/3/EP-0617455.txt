<ABSTRACT>
An improved semiconductor device fabrication technique is 
disclosed. A resist layer, composed of a chemical compound which 

generates an acid when exposed to energy light and a resin which 
contains protecting groups that are removed from the resin by 

acid, is formed on top of a semiconductor substrate. The resist 
layer is subjected to a lithography and a development process and 

is formed into a resist pattern. This resist pattern is exposed 
to ultraviolet beams, and the chemical compound generates an acid 

and the protecting groups are removed from the resin. As a 
result of such an elimination reaction, the surface of the resist 

pattern becomes coarse. Thereafter, an implant of ions is carried 
out to the semiconductor substrate using the resist pattern 

as a mask. The surface of the semiconductor substrate is cleaned 
using a cleaning solution, and the resist pattern with a coarse 

surface can easily and completely be removed from the semiconductor 
substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of fabricating semiconductor
devices.In the manufacture of semiconductor devices, a resist pattern
formed on a semiconductor substrate is removed after an
implant of ions has been carried out. The ion implantation,
particularly when carried out at a high dose, causes the surface
of the resist pattern to harden, and removal of such a resist
pattern with a hardened surface cannot be done by using a usual
cleaning acidic solution. Therefore, dry ashing with the help of
a gas of O2 is used. This dry ashing technique, however, cannot
achieve complete removal of every resist pattern formed on the
semiconductor substrate.Referring now to FIGS. 3a to 3f, one of the conventional
semiconductor device fabrication techniques is described.Formed on a semiconductor substrate 10 is a 1.5 µm-thick
resist layer 11 (see FIG. 3a). This resist layer 11 is formed by
a novolac resin and naphthoquinonediazide (i.e. TSMR-V3, a product
of Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., Ltd.) and is used for forming
resist patterns for usual ion implantations.As shown in FIG. 3b, an i-line stepper (NA: 0.50), not
shown, gives off i-line indicated by arrows 13 so that the resist 
layer 11 is exposed to the i-line 13 through an ion implantation
mask 12 having a predetermined pattern.Next, the resist layer 11 is subjected to a heating process
as well as to a developing process, and is formed into a resist
pattern 11'.As shown in FIG. 3d, with using the resist pattern 11' as a
mask, an implant of As+ ions, indicated by arrows 14, is carried
out to the semiconductor substrate 10 at a high dose of
(1 × 1016 cm-2). As described previously, such a high-dose ion implantation
causes the surface of the resist layer's 11 to deteriorate
or harden, and thus the resist pattern 11' cannot be removed by a
sulfuric acid solution.Therefore, a dry ashing process using O2, indicated by
arrows 15, is performed to remove the resist pattern 11' (see
FIG. 3e).Although most of the resist pattern 11' is removed by the
dry ashing process 15, the semiconductor substrate 11' still
suffers from some unwanted residues/particles 16(see FIG. 3f).The residues/particles 16 become a defect cause at later
processing steps, thereby decreasing the yield of semiconductor
devices.In order to remove the residues/particles 16 lingering on
the semiconductor substrate 10, the surface of the semiconductor
substrate 10 can be rinsed using an acidic cleaning solution.
However, this only worsens the already worsened throughput due to
the previous dry ashing process,
