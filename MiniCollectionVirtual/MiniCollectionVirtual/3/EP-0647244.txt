<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an unsaturated ethylene copolymer, a method for producing the ethylene copolymer, and the use of the ethylene copolymer in compositions for producing cross-linked structures, such as material for electric cables. In the method, ethylene and at least one monomer which is copolymerisable with ethylene and includes a polyunsaturated comonomer having a chain of at least 8 carbon atoms and at least 2 non-conjugated double bonds, of which at least one is terminal, are polymerised at a pressure of about 100-300 MPa and a temperature of about 80-300 DEG C under the action of a radical initiator. The polyunsaturated comonomer preferably is an  alpha , omega -alkadiene having 8-16 carbon atoms, most preferred 1,9-decadiene. Apart from the polyunsaturated comonomer, polymerisation may also involve another vinyl-unsaturated monomer, preferably containing at least one functional group selected from hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups and ester groups. The ethylene copolymers produced have an increased degree of unsaturation, which can be used for cross-linking the ethylene copolymer or grafting reactive groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a polyunsaturated compound as a comonomer in the production of an unsaturated ethylene copolymer. More specifically, the invention concerns said use wherein the unsaturated ethylene copolymer is having an increased degree of unsaturation and is being producted by radical polymerisation through a high-pressure process.Normally, polyethylene produced by radical polymerisation, so-called LDPE, has a low degree of unsaturation in the order of 0.1 double bonds/1000 carbon atoms. In many situations, it is desirable to use polymers having a higher degree of unsaturation, which may serve as seat for chemical reactions, such as the introduction of functional groups into the polymer molecule or the cross-linking of the polymer. It is known that an increased level of double bonds can be obtained in polyethylene produced by organometallic catalysis, i.e. involving a coordination catalyst, by introducing as comonomers compounds having several double bonds, in which case only one bond is used for polymerising the comonomer into the polymer chain. EP 0 008 528 and JP 0 226 1809, for instance, disclose such prior-art techniques. Further, EP 0 260 999 relates to copolymers of ethylene and dienes having 4-18 carbon atoms, such as 1,4-hexadiene, in which case polymerisation is performed by means of a so-called metallocene catalyst at a high pressure. Mention may also be made of WO 91/17194 which concems copolymers of α-olefins, such as ethylene, and α,ω-dienes having 7-30 carbon atoms, preferably 8-12 carbon atoms, such as 1,9-decadiene, in which case polymerisation is coordination-catalysed. Moreover, US 3,357,961 discloses the production of a copolymer of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene by coordination-catalysed low-pressure polymerisation.

These abstracts relate to copolymers of ethylene and non-conjugated dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene and 1,9-decadiene, and involve the use of coordination-catalysed polymerisation.As already mentioned, the above references relate to coordination-catalysed polymerisation.
