Steam generator arrangement, in particular of 
a low temperature carbonization combustion plant, with 

a flue gas channel, having several sections (3, 4, 5), 
in a supporting structure (1), whereby a first 

vertically extending section (3) is connected by way of 
a second at least approximately horizontally extending 

section (4) to a likewise vertically extending third 
section (5), so that the flue gas channel forms a 

structural unit, and whereby the first section (3) is 
suspended by means of supporting elements (16, 19) in 

the supporting structure (1), characterized in that the 
supporting elements (16, 19) in the cold condition have 

an oblique position (16', 19') in relation to the 
vertical, which position essentially corresponds to the 

thermal expansion of the second, horizontal section (4) 
in the hot condition, with the result that the 

supporting elements (16, 19) extend parallel to the 
vertical in the hot condition. 
Arrangement according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the supporting elements (16, 19) 

are tubes which are connected to heating surfaces (12) 
forming the walls of the flue gas channel at least in 

part. 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that in the region of the longitudinal 

axes (25, 26) of the first and the third section (3 and 
5) means (35) are provided to guide the first section 

(3) relative to the third section (5), whereby the 
longitudinal axis (26) of the third section (5) is used 

as a fixed axis. 
Arrangement according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the guide means (35) are tubes 

which are connected to heating surfaces (12) forming 
5 the walls of the flue gas channel at least in part. 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4,
  
 

characterized in that the first section (3) of the flue 
gas channel is arranged in a first supporting grate 

(21) which is connected by means of the supporting 
elements (16, 19) to a second supporting grate (20) 

arranged above the flue gas channel and by means of at 
least one connecting element (17) to a third supporting 

grate (15) arranged below the flue gas channel, whereby 
the flue gas channel is supported on the third 

supporting grate (15) suspended from the second 
supporting grate (20). 
Arrangement according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that the first supporting grate (21) 

is constructed as a frame and encloses the first 
section (3). 
Arrangement according to claim 5 or 6,
 
characterized in that the third section (5) is 

suspended by means of further supporting elements (40, 
41) from the second supporting grate (20). 
Arrangement according to one of claims 5 or 6,
 
characterized in that the third supporting grate (15) 

is connected by means of at least one further 
connecting element (18) to the second supporting grate 

(20). 
Arrangement according to one of claims 5 to 8,
 
characterized in that the connecting elements (17, 18) 

and/or the additional supporting elements (40, 41) are 
tubes connected to the heating surfaces (12).
