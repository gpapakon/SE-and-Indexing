<ABSTRACT>
An insert (1) for a reamer is proposed which is used for the finishing of metallic workpieces and has a main cutting edge (7) and a secondary cutting edge (3) as well as a rake face (15) extending up to the cutting edges and a chip breaker (17) defining the rake face (15). The insert (1) is distinguished by the fact that the chip breaker (17) has a high point (19) at the apex (9) of the cutting edges (3, 7). The chip breaker (17) falls away from the high point (19) in the area of the main cutting edge, i.e. it is at an increasing distance from the main cutting edge, and falls away at an acute angle in the area of the secondary cutting edge (3).

A knife plate for a reamer for the fine machining of metal
workpieces, with a primary and a secondary cutting edge (7, 3),

with a face extending to these cutting edges, and with a chip guide
step (17) bordering the said face, 
characterised in that
, in the region
of the apex (9) of the cutting edges (3, 7), the chip guide step (17)

has a high point (19) from which the chip guide step (17) slopes
downwards in the region of the primary cutting edge (7), that is to

say, is at an increasing distance from the primary cutting edge (7),
and, in the region of the secondary cutting edge (3), the said guide

step extends parallel to the secondary cutting edge or is likewise
disposed in a downward-sloping manner.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
, in the
region of the secondary cutting edge (3), the chip guide step is

disposed in an evenly downward-sloping manner and, when the
front (11) of the knife plate (1) is viewed from above, the said guide

step is at an acute angle to the secondary cutting edge.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that
,
in the region of the primary cutting edge (7), the cutting edge of the

knife plate (1) has two regions (35, 37) with different angles of
slope.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that
, in the
forward, first region (37) in a view towards the front side (5) of the

knife plate (1), the primary cutting edge (7) slopes downwards at an
angle of approx. 30° to the imaginary centre line (23) of the knife 

plate (1) and, in the rearward, second region (35) which borders on
the apex (9) and becomes the secondary cutting edge (3), the said

primary cutting edge slopes downwards at an angle of approx. 3°
to the imaginary centre line (23) of the knife plate (1).
A knife plate as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, 
characterised in that
,
in a view towards the front side (5) of the knife plate (1), the chip

guide step (17), extending from the high point (19), slopes
downwards at an angle of 10° to 30°, preferably 15° to 25°, and

in particular 20°.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that

the primary cutting edge (7) of the knife plate (1) is curved.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in that
, in a view
towards the front side (5) of the knife plate (1/1), the chip guide

step (17), extending from the high point (19), slopes downwards in
a first portion (25) at an angle of approx. 10° to 30°, in particular

15° to 25°, and preferably approximately 20°, to the imaginary
centre line (23) of the knife plate (1/1) and, in an adjoining second

portion (27), the said guide step slopes downwards at an angle of
approx. 40° to 80°, in particular 50° to 70°, and preferably 60°.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the first
portion (25) of the chip guide step (17) is substantially shorter than

the second portion (27).
A knife plate as claimed in claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the first
portion (25) extends over a distance of approx. 0.5 mm, measured

parallel to the centre line (23) of the knife plate (1). 
A knife plate as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the height of the chip guide step (17) in the
region of the high point (19) is 0.05 mm to 0.3 mm, preferably

0.1 mm.
A knife plate as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterised by
 being in the form of a turnplate which, in order to
achieve the best possible utilisation of the cutting edges, can be

turned 180° about a centre axis extending perpendicular to the
surface (the front of the knife (11)).
A knife plate as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the said plate is of a substantially rectangular
design, the longer exterior edge of the knife plate (1; 1/1)

comprising the secondary cutting edge (3).
A knife plate as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the distance between the apex (9) and the high
point (19), said distance being measured perpendicular to the centre

line (23) of the knife plate (1), is specified in dependence on the
material of the machined workpiece.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 13, 
characterised in that
, where a
workpiece is made of steel, the distance between the apex (9) and

the high point (19) is 3/10 mm to 7/10 mm, preferably 5/10 mm.
A knife plate as claimed in claim 13, 
characterised in that
, where a
workpiece is made of aluminum, the distance between the apex (9)

and the high point (19) is 5/10 mm to 10/10 mm, preferably
8/10 mm.
