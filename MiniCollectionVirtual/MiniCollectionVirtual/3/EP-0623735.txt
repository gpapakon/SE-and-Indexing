<ABSTRACT>
A seal (46) heated by hot pressurized vapor is cooled by 
providing a chamber (32) in which the seal (46) is located and for 

containing vapor that leaks thereinto. The pressure in the 
chamber is reduced by connecting it to a source of low 

pressure; and liquid is supplied to the chamber at a 
pressure above the reduced pressure of the chamber (32) and at a 

temperature below the temperature of vapor leaking into the 
chamber. The liquid is introduced into the chamber (32) as 

droplets for contacting vapor that leaks thereinto thereby 
cooling the vapor and thus cooling the seal (46). The flow rate 

of the liquid is adjustable in accordance with the 
temperature of the liquid in the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for
cooling a seal for machinery including rotating machinery,
and more particularly, for cooling the seal of a turbine
shaft.Rotating machinery, such as turbine wheels mounted on a
shaft, require rotary seals in the region where the shaft
passes through the pressure chamber that contains the
turbine wheels. Such seals inhibit leakage of working fluid
from the pressure chamber into the seal operating
environment and then into the atmosphere. In addition,
seals are also required in other machinery.Seals for rotating machinery usually comprise a
labyrinth seal followed by a mechanical seal. Labyrinth
seals serve to restrict the rate of flow of working fluid
and reduce its pressure toward atmospheric pressure, but not
to prevent or contain the flow. Typically, labyrinth seals
have many compartments positioned very close to the surface
of the shaft for presenting to the working fluid in the
pressure chamber a torturous path that serves to reduce
pressure and inhibit, but not halt leakage. A mechanical
seal, on the other hand, serves to contain the working
fluid. The extent to which containment is achieved depends
on the design of the seal and the nature of the working
fluid involved.When the working fluid is steam, some escape of the
working fluid can be tolerated. Nevertheless, a shaft seal
for the steam turbine is a critical item. It is even more
critical when the working fluid is a hydrocarbon, such as
pentane or isopentane, and the turbine operates as part of
an organic Rankine cycle power plant. In such case, the
mechanical seals must preclude to as great an extent as
possible the loss of working fluid to the atmosphere. Reliable operation of the mechanical seals for turbines, as well as for other types
of equipment where the temperature of the mechanical seal is elevated, requires the
seals to operate under optimum working conditions of pressure, temperature, vibration,
etc. These working conditions have a significant impact on seal leakage rates and seal
life expectancy, for example. By extending seal life, turbine life and hence reliability is
extended.Seal life is adversely affected by high operating pressure which tends to distort
seal faces. High operating pressure also increases wear rate, heat generated at the seal
faces which further distorts seal faces and results in increased leakage. In addition, the
high pressure increases power consumption for the turbine sealing system.Seal life is adversely affected by high operating temperatures of
