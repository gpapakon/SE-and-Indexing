<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for sorting material (13,14) into desired and undesired portions 
thereof comprising support means (10,11) for supporting material (13,14) to be 

sorted; examination means (20,32) for determining the presence on the support 
means (10) of any undesired material (13); at least one conduit means (22,23) 

having an inlet pipe (22) through which undesired material (13) may be 
withdrawn from the support means (10,11); suction means (25) for 

communicating with the or each conduit means (22,23) so as to cause undesired 
material (13) to be withdrawn therethrough by suction; and movement effecting 

means (26), controlled by the examination means, for moving the inlet pipe (22) 
of the or each conduit means (22,23) between a first position in which it is 

spaced from the support means (10,11) and is closed to the suction means 925), 
and a second position in which it is adjacent to the support means (10,11) and is 

open to the suction means (25). The end portion (44) of the inlet pipe (22) 
adjacent the support means (10,11) is reduced in internal cross section in a 

direction away from the support means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns apparatus for sorting material such, for example, 
as a foodstuff, into desired and undesired portions thereof. The term "material", as used herein, is intended to have a broad meaning 
so as to include pieces of solid material; particulate material; material, eg. a 
slurry, containing a liquid; and material in the form of a pur√©e or the like. 
Moreover the material may be of animal, mineral or vegetable origin or any 
combination thereof. Although not so restricted, however, the invention is 
particularly applicable to the sorting of foodstuffs to remove blemished or 
unwanted parts thereof. It is known in a canning process for canning tomato pieces to pass these 
pieces on a conveyor belt past a number of operatives who try to remove any 
calyx or blemished material therefrom by hand. This, however, is a slow and 
expensive procedure which is not particularly effective in removing all the 
undesired material and results in substantial loss of good product. In US-A-4,186,836 there is disclosed apparatus for sorting material into 
desired and undesired portions thereof comprising support means for supporting 
material to be sorted; examination means for determining the presence on the 
support means of any undesired material; conduit means having a row of inlet 
pipes arranged transversely of the support means, through which undesired 
material may be withdrawn from the support means; suction means for 
communicating with the inlet pipe so as to cause undesired material to be 
withdrawn therethrough by suction; and movement effecting means, controlled 
by the examination means, for moving each selected inlet pipe between a first 
position in which it is spaced from the support means and is closed to the suction  
 
means, and a second position in which it is adjacent to the support means and is 
open to the suction means. The inlet pipes are contiguous square cross section tubes whose bottom is 
open and the edges of three sides are cut back to leave a lip on the lower edge of 
the fourth side. According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for 
sorting material into desired and undesired portions, comprising support means 
for supporting material to be sorted; examination means for determining the 
presence on the support means of any undesired material; at least one conduit 
means having an inlet pipe through which undesired material may be withdrawn 
from the support means; suction means for communicating with the inlet pipe so 
as to cause undesired

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for sorting material (13,14) into desired and undesired 
portions thereof, comprising support means (10,11) for supporting material 

(13,14) to be sorted; examination means (20,32) for determining the presence on 
the support means (10,11) of any undesired material (13); at least one conduit 

means (22,23) having an inlet pipe (22) through which undesired material (13) 
may be withdrawn from the support means (10,11); suction means (25) for 

communicating with the inlet pipe (22) so as to cause undesired material (13) to 
be withdrawn therethrough by suction; and movement effecting means (26), 

controlled by the examination means (20,32), for moving the inlet pipe (22) of 
the or each conduit means (22,23) between a first position in which it is spaced 

from the support means (10,11) and is close to the suction means (25), and a 
second position in which it is adjacent to the support means (10,11) and is open 

to the suction means (25), characterised in that the internal cross section of the 
inlet pipe (22) is reduced in a direction away from the support means (10,11). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the reduction in 
cross section is in the end portion (44) of the inlet pipe (22) adjacent the support 

means (10,11). 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the end 
portion (44) of the inlet pipe (22) has a planar edge adjacent the support means 

(10,11).
