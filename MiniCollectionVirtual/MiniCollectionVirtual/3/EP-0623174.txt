<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assay for 
homocysteine in clinical samples. Homocysteine is an intermediary amino acid produced when 
methionine is metabolised to cysteine. Generally, 
homocysteine produced in the body is rapidly metabolised 
by one of two routes, (1) condensation with serine to 
form cystathione or (2) conversion to methionine, and 
its concentration (and that of its oxidised form 
homocystine) in the living body under normal conditions 
is virtually negligible. Homocysteine levels in biological samples may however be 
of clinical significance in a number of situations as 
homocysteine plays an important part in the complex set 
of pathways which make up sulphydryl amino acid 
metabolism and its accumulation may be indicative of 
various disorders occurring in these pathways, including 
in particular inborn errors of metabolism. Thus, for 
example homocystinuria (an abnormal build-up of 
homocysteine in the urine) is known to be a disorder of 
amino acid metabolism resulting from deficiencies -in the 
enzymes cystathione Î² synthetase or methyltetrahydrofolic 
acid methyltransferase (which catalyses the 
methylation of homocysteine to methionine). Sulphydryl amino acid metabolism is closely linked to 
that of folic acid and vitamin B12 (cobalamin), which act 
as substrates or co-factors in the various 
transformations involved. For this reason homocysteine 
accumulation has also been proposed as an indicator of 
malfunction of cobalamin or folate dependent enzymes, or 
other disorders or diseases related to cobalamin or 
folate metabolism.  
 Moreover since homocysteine conversion to methionine 
relies on a reaction requiring S-methyl tetrahydrofolate 
as the methyl donor, homocysteine metabolism may also be 
affected by anti-folate drugs, such as methotrexate, 
administered to combat other disorders, notably cancer. 
Monitoring of homocysteine has therefore also been 
proposed in the management of malignant disease 
treatment with anti-folate drugs. More recently, elevated levels of homocysteine in the 
blood have been correlated with the development of 
atherosclerosis (see Clarke et al., New Eng. J. Med. 
324:1149-1155 (1991)) and even moderate homocysteinemia 
is now regarded as a risk factor for cardiac and 
vascular diseases. Measurement of plasma or blood 
levels of homocysteine is thus also of importance in the 
diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. Although immunological methods of determining 
homocysteine directly are not available as there is no 
available
