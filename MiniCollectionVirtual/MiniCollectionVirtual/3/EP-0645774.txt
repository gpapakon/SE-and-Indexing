<ABSTRACT>
In an EPROM including a number of EPROM cells arranged in the 
form of a matrix having a plurality of rows and a plurality of columns, 

and a plurality of digit lines each connected in common to drains of the 
EPROM cells included in a corresponding one column of EPROM cells. 

A Y selector receives a Y address of a given address for selecting one 
digit line of the digit lines so as to connect the selected digit line to a sense 

amplifier. Each of the digit line is connected to one reading-inhibition 
circuits having a reading-inhibition information storing EPROM cell, so 

that when the reading-inhibition information storing EPROM cell of the 
reading-inhibition circuits are in a written condition, the digit line is 

forcibly maintained at a predetermined logic level. 
With this arrangement, the memory protection circuit can inhibit 
the reading of any bit or bits and any area of an EPROM with a simple 

structure of circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device,
and more specifically, to an EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM
(Read Only Memory)) formed within a single chip microcomputer and
associated with a read-inhibiting circuit for protecting a content of the
EPROM.An EPROM is widely used for development and evaluation of a
program to be written in a masked ROM which is mainly used in articles
manufactured on a mass production basis, and also for an initial mass
production stage of articles. Therefore, the EPROM is written with
information, such as know-how of a program, which should be kept secret
from outsiders. However, since a content of the EPROM can easily be
read by a PROM writer, it has become necessary to provide a memory
protection circuit for the EPROM for the purpose of protecting the
information written in the EPROMJapanese Patent Post-examination Publication No. Showa 61-28144 (JP-A-56 074 898)
proposed a conventional example of the memory protection circuit for the
EPROM. The memory protection circuit disclosed in this Japanese patent
publication is shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, this EPROM memory protection circuit is
provided for an erasable ROM (EPROM) 301 including a number of
memory cells which are of the FAMOS (floating gate avalanche injection
MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor)) structure and which are arranged in
the form of a matrix. A plurality of output signal lines 302 extend from
the EPROM 301.The EPROM memory protection circuit includes a read-inhibiting
flag 303 composed of an EPROM cell of the FAMOS structure which is
provided separately from the EPROM 301 and which is written through a
writing line 304, and a read-inhibiting circuit composed of a two-input
AND gates 306 of the number corresponding to the number of the output
signal lines 302 extending from the EPROM 301. Each of the two-input
AND gates 306 has its one input connected to a corresponding one of the
output signal lines 302 of the EPROM 301 and its other input connected in
common to an output signal line 305 of the read-inhibiting flag 303. A
port 307 is connected to respective output signal lines of the two-input
AND gates 306.Now, operation of the EPROM memory protection circuit shown in
Figure 1 will be explained.
1. In the case where the reading of the EPROM 301 is inhibited.
In order to inhibit the reading of the EPROM 301, the read-inhibiting
flag 303 is preliminarily written through the writing line 304,
so that the value of the output signal line 305 of the read-inhibiting flag
303 is
