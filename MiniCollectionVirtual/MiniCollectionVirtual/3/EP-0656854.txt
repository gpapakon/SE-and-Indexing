<ABSTRACT>
A packaging for small objects comprising at least one box (1) made up of a plurality of side walls (2-5), a bottom wall (6) defining a space (7), and an inlet opening (8), a lid (10), a tab (11) joined to the lid so that it projects into the space (7) when the lid is closed over the opening (8), a projection (14) comprising an abutment (15) and being integral with the tab so that said abutment (15) and the underside (16) of the lid lie on either side of the plane (17) of the opening (8) when the lid is closed thereover, and a flap (20) pivotably mounted on the edge (22) of the opening (8) and shaped so that when the lid covers the opening and the tab projects into the space, at least one portion (23) of said flap lies between the underside (16) of the lid (10) and the abutment surface (15). The packaging is suitable for containing pawns and other pieces for games such as draughts and chess.

Packaging including a box (1) and at least two flaps (95, 96), said box
comprising a plurality of lateral walls (2-5) and a bottom (6) co-operating with

said lateral walls to define with them a volume (7) adapted to contain objects,
said lateral walls also defining an opening (8) into said volume, said box being

made from a sheet of relatively rigid material of thickness "e", and including:

a square central part (60) with a side of length "L",
four lateral elements (61-64), each comprising:

rectangular first (71) and second (72) parts adapted to be
superposed with a length of substantially "L-e" and a width of substantially "L-2e",

and
first hinge means (77) for hinging together said first and
second parts (71, 72) about a first axis (78) so that a first width (74) of the first

part (71) is substantially coincident with a width of the second part (72) and
the pivot axis (78) is at the intersection of two faces of the first and second

parts so that, when the two parts are at 180°, they are both on the same side of
the plane passing through one face of one of the two parts,
means (65) for associating each lateral element with said central part,
said means for associating each lateral element with said central part

comprising second hinge means (80) for hinging together the first part (71)
of a lateral element and one side (73) of the central part (60) so that a length of

said first part (71) is coincident with a first side of said central part (60) along
a straight line defining the pivot axis (81) between this first part (71) and the

central part (60), the second width (82) of said first part (71) and a second side
(83) of said central part (60) lie in a common plane (84) perpendicular to said

pivot axis (81) between said first part (71) and said central part (60), and said
four pivot axes between the first parts (71) of the lateral elements (61-64) and

the central part (60) and said four pivot axes between the first (71) and the
second (72) parts of the lateral elements (61-64) are all in a common plane

when the central part, the lateral elements and the first and second parts of
said lateral elements are at 180°,

   said two flaps (95, 96) pivoting on two opposite sides of said
opening (8) of the box to close said opening,

CHARACTERIZED BY THE FACT THAT said sheet comprises at least two layers, one
layer of rigide material and one layer of flexible material bonded together,

that said hinge means (77, 80) are constituted by a cut in said rigid material 
layer extending through all of its thickness as far as said flexible material

layer, that the dimensions of said two flaps are defined to cover substantially
all of the opening when they are both substantially in the plane of said

opening, one flap (96) having a male part (97) in its plane and on one of its
edges, the other flap (95) having a female part (98) complementary to said

male part in its plane and on one of its edges so these two male and female
parts co-operate by nesting one within the other when the two flaps pivot into

the plane of said opening, and that it further comprises:

a lid (10) adapted to fit onto said box to cover at least part of said
opening (8),
at least one lug (11) co-operating with said lid so that said lug extends
downwardly into said volume (7) when said lid (10) is covering at least a part

of said opening (8), and
a projecting part (14) having an abutment surface (15), said

projecting part being fastened to said lug so that the abutment surface (15)
and the bottom (16) of said lid lie on opposite sides of the plane (17) of said

opening (8) when said lid is covering said opening, the shape of said flaps
which are pivoting substantially on the edge (22) of said opening (8) being

such that, when said lid is covering said opening and when said plug extends
downwardly into said volume, at least part (23) of the flaps lies between the

bottom (16) of said lid (10) and said abutment surface (15).
