<ABSTRACT>
Each of a plurality of terminals includes a 
processing section , a cooperation controlling section 

and an inputting section. The inputting section inputs, 
to the cooperation controlling section, input data and 

switching data for switching over a cooperative 
operation mode and an individual operation mode. The 

switching section switches over the cooperative 
operation mode and the individual operation mode on the 

basis of the switching data given from the inputting 
section. The self-input processing section supplies, 

when in the cooperative operation mode, the input data 
from the self-inputting section to the self-processing 

section and other processing sections which should 

operate in cooperation and supplies, when in the 
individual operation mode, the input data from the self-inputting 

section to the self-processing section. The 
cooperation input processing section supplies, when in 

the cooperative operation mode, the self-processing 
section with input data from other processing sections 

but supplying, when in the individual operation mode, 
the self-processing section with no input data from the 

other processing section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
and a method of controlling cooperative operations, 
which work to simultaneously execute the same processing 
with cooperative operations of a plurality of terminals 
connected to a network. With personalization of a computer system in recent 
years, an environment is going to be prepared, wherein a 
single person has one set of computer. Further, in this 
computer system, a plurality of computers are connected 
to a network such as a LAN (Local Area Network). 
Distributed processing of the data can be executed 
between the computers via the network. Under such 
circumstances, there is demanded such an environment 
that the same processing is simultaneously executed by 
the computer-to-computer cooperative operations by use 
of the computer system. In a cooperative operation control apparatus for 
performing the cooperative operations, a plurality of 
terminals, e.g., the above computers, are connected to 
each other via the network. Each terminal is provided 
with a processing section for executing the processing 
of an application program. A cooperation controlling 
section for operating each processing section is  
 
provided corresponding to each processing section. Each cooperation controlling section inputs user's 
input data to a self-terminal from a data inputting 
section such as a mouse or a keyboard. The cooperation 
controlling section simultaneously outputs the input 
data of the self-terminal to other terminal which should 
operate in cooperation. Then, each terminal supplies 
the input data to the processing section, thereby 
starting the above processing. Subsequently, the data which should be used in 
common are distributed to each terminal during the 
cooperative operation of each processing section. Each 
processing section refers to the identical input data 
among items of the data which should be used in common. 
It is thus possible for the user to refer to or retrieve 
and update the identical input data. Further, in other conventional cooperative 
operation control apparatuses, the cooperation 
controlling section temporarily transmits the input data 
of the self-terminal to an input server. Hereat, the 
input server having a right of control simultaneously 
outputs the input data of the self-terminal to other 
terminals which should operate in cooperation. Each cooperation controlling section, however, 
causes each processing section to operate in cooperation 
all the time, and hence, the processing sections always 
use the same
