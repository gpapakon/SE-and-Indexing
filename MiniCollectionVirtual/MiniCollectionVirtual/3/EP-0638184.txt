<ABSTRACT>
A data processing system comprising a plurality of computers (2) interconnected through a local network (1), preferably in form of a ring network, said network (1) being connected to a network adaptor (7) which is able to receive all information on the network (7). The network adaptor (7) is connected to a computer (8), which together with the adaptor (7) can perform an assembling and scanning of substantially all files on the network and carry out a recognition of virus signatures, if any. In this manner the individual file packets circulating in the ring network are assembled, said file packets being assembled in a file and scanned for virus signatures, if any. When a virus signature is detected in the file, information is simultaneously provided on the transmitting stations and the receiving stations, whereafter it is possible to transmit the vaccine to the stations in question. The close-down period of the system due to detection of a virus has thereby been reduced to zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a data processing system comprising a plurality 
of computers interconnected through a local network, preferably in form 
of a ring network, said network being connected to a network adaptor 
which is able to receive all information on the network. Such a network adaptor is able to measure the performance and the 
speed of the network, inter alia in order to evaluate whether the network 
is optimally structured. A ring network can be connected to a network server. The network 
server can comprise a network program accessible for the users at each 
work station. Each user can furthermore have access to the logic drive 
of the network server, whereby the user can enter programs and data 
which can subsequently be read by another user without floppy disks 
being exchanged between the users. The network server can furthermore 
include a virus program accessible for the user of a work station so 
as to enable him to scan the local disk for virae. The user can carry out 
a virus scanning at regular intervals. A virus, if any, may, however, have 
infected a large number of work stations before being detected. The object of the invention is to provide a data processing system of the 
above type, whereby a virus, if any, and computers infected thereby are 
detected far quicker than previously so as to limit the spreading of the 
virus.  
 The data processing system according to the invention is characterised 
in that the network adaptor is connected to a computer 
which together with the 
adaptor can perform an assembling and scanning of substantially all 
files on the network and carry out a recognition of virus signatures, 
if any, in the files, the computer connected to the adaptor having 
means for providing information on the place of origin of infected data, if 
any, as well as on the position to which said infected data have been transmitted, 
and the computer connected to the adaptor comprising a 
neural network in form of a program having means for recognizing the usual 
interchange of data resembling virae on the local network and for actuating 
an alarm if an unusual interchange of data resembling a virus, such as an 
unknown virus signature, is recognized. In addition according to the invention, 
the computer connected to the adaptor comprises means 
for transmitting a so-called "vaccine" to the computers optionally infected 
by said virus or said virae, said vaccine being implemented by causing the 
computer connected to the adaptor to start a scanning on the 
infected

<CLAIMS>
A data processing system comprising a plurality of computers 
interconnected through a local network, in form of a ring network, said 

network being connected to a network adaptor which is able to receive 
all information on the network, 
characterised
 in that the network 
adaptor (7) is connected to a computer (8), which together with the 

adaptor (7) can perform an assembling and scanning of substantially all 
files on the network (1) and carry out a recognition of virus signatures, 

if any, in the files, the computer (8) connected to the adaptor (7) having 
means for providing information on the place of origin of infected data, if 

any, as well as on the position to which said infected data have been transmitted, 
and the computer (8) connected to the adaptor (7) comprising a 

neural network in form of a program having means for recognizing the usual 
interchange of data resembling virae on the local network (1) and for actuating 

an alarm if an unusual interchange of data resembling a virus, such as an 
unknown virus signature, is recognized. 
A data processing system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the computer (8) connected to the adaptor (7) comprises means for 
transmitting a so-called "vaccine" to the computers (8) optionally infected 

by said virus or said virae, said vaccine being implemented by causing the 
computer (8) connected to the adaptor (7) to start a scanning on the 

infected computers (8) by means of a program known per se for 
neutralizing said virus.
