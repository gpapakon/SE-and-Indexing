<ABSTRACT>
An article of manufacture comprising a thermoformed polyvinyl 
alcohol compounded with a solid plasticizer and a liquid plasticizer, 

the polyvinyl alcohol made melt extrudable by adding sufficient energy 
to the polyvinyl alcohol to both melt it and substantially eliminate the 

crystallinity in the melt while simultaneously removing energy from the 
melt at a rate sufficient avoid decomposition of the polyvinyl alcohol 

and the solid plasticizer being sorbitol, mannitol, pentaerythritol 
and/or dipentaerythritol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to melt extrudable polyvinyl alcohol 
compositions useful for injection molding of articles, particularly 
personal care articles which are flushable and biodegradable. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) is a water soluble, repulpable and biodegradable 
resin with excellent aroma and oxygen barrier properties and 
resistance to most organic solvents. The polymer is used extensively in 
adhesive, textile sizing and paper coating. However, the end uses of 
PVOH have been limited despite its excellent mechanical, physical and 
chemical properties to those uses in which it is supplied as a solution 
in water. This limitation is partly due to the fact that the vinyl 
alcohol polymers in the unplasticized state have a high degree of 
crystallinity and show little or no thermoplasticity before the 
occurrence of decomposition which starts at about 107°C and becomes 
pronounced at 200°C, which is well below its crystalline melting point. U.S. 5,051,222 discloses a method for making thermoplastic (melt 
extrudable) PVOH compositions which comprises providing sufficient 
energy to a PVOH which is at least partially crystalline to both melt 
the PVOH and substantially eliminate the crystallinity in the PVOH melt 
while simultaneously removing energy from the PVOH melt at a rate 
sufficient to avoid decomposition of the PVOH. The melt is then 
extruded, preferably into a strand, rapidly cooled and cut into pellets 
for subsequent thermoprocessing into the desired product or article. U.S. 4,618,648 discloses a modified self-plasticizing poly(vinyl 
alcohol) which is a poly(vinyl alcohol)-co-poly(alkyleneoxy) acrylate. In the present public concern for preserving the environment, 
there is a search for materials which, when disposed of after use, will 
physically or biologically decompose and thereby avoid polluting the 
environment. One logical candidate for such a material is water soluble 
PVOH. The desirable physical and mechanical properties of PVOH such as 
biodegradability, water solubility and repulpability combined with 
thermoplasticity have opened a new market opportunity for PVOH. An  
 
example includes packaging applications in which PVOH film is used for 
packaging pesticides, caustic cleaners and detergents. These packages 
are dissolved in water during use thereby eliminating human exposure to 
high toxic or concentrated chemicals and the need to clean and discard a 
contaminated chemical container after use. The PVOH films are also used 
to control contamination in hospitals.
