<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tunnel dust collecting system for 
removing dust and smoke from the contaminated air in a tunnel 

used for automotive traffic, the system comprising a dust 
collecting chamber (2) formed in the upper space of a tunnel 

(1) with a sealing board (5) in such a manner that said dust 
collecting chamber has one end serving as an air sucking end 

(2a) and the other end serving as an air supplying end (2b); 
electric dust collecto
rs (3) arranged in said dust collecting 
chamber (2); and air blowers (4) in said dust collecting 

chamber (2) at the air supplying end. According to the prior 
art, it is a problem to efficiently mix the contaminated with 

the purified air obtained from such a dust collecting system. 
This problem is solved in that in said dust collecting system 

said air blowers (4) have casings exposed in the lower space of 
said tunnel (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tunnel dust collecting 
system in which an electrical dust collector is used to remove 
dust and smoke from the contaminated air in a tunnel thereby to 
use the air again, and more particularly to a tunnel dust 
collecting system which is installed on the ceiling of a tunnel 
which is provided mainly for automobiles. There are available a variety of tunnel dust collecting 
systems. Typical ones of the systems, are a tunnel dust 
collecting system of bypass tunnel type as shown in Fig. 8(A), 
and a tunnel dust collecting system of ceiling installation 
type as shown in Fig. 8(B) and Figs. 9(A) and 9(B). Figs. 9(A) 
and 9(B) are a plan view and a sectional view of the tunnel 
dust collecting system shown in Fig. 8(B). In the tunnel dust collecting system of bypass tunnel 
type as shown in Fig. 8(A), a bypass tunnel is connected, as a 
dust collecting chamber 2, to the main tunnel 1 provided for 
automobiles, so that the air contaminated in the tunnel 1 is 
led into the dust collecting chamber at one end opened in the 
side wall of the main tunnel 1, where it is decontaminated with 
an electrical dust collector 3 (hereinafter referred to merely 
as "a dust collector 3", when applicable). The air thus  
 
processed is supplied into the main tunnel 1 with an air blower 
4 through the other end of the dust collecting chamber 2. On the other hand, in the tunnel dust collecting system 
of ceiling installation type, a ceiling board 5 is installed in 
such a manner as to form a dust collecting chamber 2 in the 
upper portion of a tunnel. The dust collecting chamber 2 has 
one end 2a which is used to suck air from the tunnel 
(hereinafter referred to as "an air sucking end 2a", when 
applicable), and the other end 2b which is used to supply 
decontaminated air into the tunnel (hereinafter referred to as 
"an air supplying end 2b", when applicable). The contaminated 
air sucked into the dust collecting chamber 2 through the air 
sucking end 2a is decontaminated with dust collectors 3, and 
the air thus decontaminated is supplied into the tunnel with 
air blowers 4 provided near the air supplying end 2b. When 
compared with the tunnel dust collecting system of bypass 
tunnel type, the tunnel dust collecting system of ceiling 
installation type is advantageous in that its installation cost 
is lower because it is unnecessary to form the bypass tunnel. In the tunnel dust collecting system of ceiling 
installation type, as shown in Fig. 9, two dust collectors 3 
are provided in the dust
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tunnel dust collecting system comprising: a dust collecting 
chamber (2) formed in the upper space of a tunnel (1) with a 

ceiling board (5) in such a manner that said dust collecting 
chamber has one end serving as an air sucking end (2a) and the 

other end serving as an air supplying end (2b); electric dust 
collectors (3) arranged in said dust collecting chamber (2); 

and air blowers 
(4) in said dust collecting chamber (2) at the air supplying end, with each air blower having a casing (4b) and following a 

respective electric dust collector 
characterized 
in that
 said ceiling board (5) is terminated at said casings 
(4b) of said air blowers (4), in order to expose said casings to the 

lower space of said tunnel (1), so that decontaminated air 
exiting from said dust collectors and the surrounding 

contaminated air can flow together smoothly. 
The tunnel dust collecting system as claimed in claim 1, in 
which a ventilated scaffold (14) is installed below said air 

blowers (4) . 
The tunnel dust collecting system as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
said casings (4b) of said air blowers are reduced in size with 

respect to said dust collecting chamber enabling that said 
contaminated and said decontaminated air meet smoothly.
