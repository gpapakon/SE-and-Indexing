<ABSTRACT>
A progressive multifocal lens of the present 
invention has, along a principal meridional curve, a 

farsight portion having a refracting power 
corresponding to a distant view, a nearsight portion 

having a refracting power corresponding to a near view, 
and an intermediate portion, located between the 

farsight and nearsight portions, for continuously 
connecting the refracting powers of the farsight and 

nearsight portions, wherein a refracting surface has a 
shape such that the angle ϑ formed by normal lines of 

the refracting surface at respective points on each of 
vertical crossing curves of the lens refracting surface 

and a principal meridional curve is changed gently and 
monotonously as being away from the principal 

meridional curve along the respective vertical crossing 
curves in a direction perpendicular to the principal 

meridional curve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a progressive 
multifocal lens used to assist an accommodation power 
of an eye. As spectacle lenses for assisting an 
accommodation power when an accommodation power of an 
eye becomes too weak to see a near point, various 
progressive multifocal lenses have been known. A 
progressive multifocal lens of this type has an upper 
"farsight portion", a lower "nearsight portion" and a 
progressive region (referred to as an "intermediate 
portion") which is located between the above two 
portions in which a refracting power is continuously 
changed. When the progressive multifocal lens is 
actually worn as spectacles by a user, the farsight 
portion becomes an upper portion while the nearsight 
portion becomes a lower portion. In the present 
invention, it is to be noted that "upper portion", 
"lower portion", "horizontal" and "vertical" are used 
to point positions of the progressive multifocal lens 
in the state that it is actually worn by the user. For 
example, the lower portion of the farsight portion is a 
position within the farsight portion close to the  
 
intermediate portion. Also, the difference between the 
nearsight refracting power and the farsight refracting 
power is called an additional power. In a progressive multifocal lens of this type, 
in general, when wide distinct vision areas of the 
farsight and nearsight portions are kept and coupled by 
the progressive power range, lens aberrations are 
concentrated on side regions of the progressive power 
range. As a result, blurring and distortion of an 
image occur in these side region. Therefore, when a 
user wears spectacles formed of these multifocal lenses 
and shifts his eyes laterally, he perceives the 
distortion of an image as the fluctuation of the image 
has an unpleasant feeling. In order to prevent such a problem of visual 
characteristics, in known progressive power lenses, 
various designs and evaluations have been made from a 
variety of viewpoints. Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view showing the 
divisions of regions of a progressive multifocal lens 
designed symmetrically. This progressive multifocal 
lens has a farsight portion F corresponding to the 
upper portion at the time of actual use, a nearsight 
portion N corresponding to the lower portion and an 
intermediate portion P in which the refracting power is 
changed continuously between the farsight and nearsight 
portions F and N. As for the shape of a lens surface,  
 
the intersecting curve MM' of the object-side lens 
surface and a cross
