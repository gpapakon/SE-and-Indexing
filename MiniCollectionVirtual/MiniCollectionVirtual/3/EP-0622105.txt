<ABSTRACT>
A pocket filter insert (24) has a suspension element (10) fabricated from flexible fabric, to which suspension element are attached, via a sealing layer (16), the upper ends of inherently rigid filter bodies (18). The latter are thus suspended so as to be able to swing and can be readily tilted by impingement or mechanical shaking in order to shake off a filter cake formed on them.

<CLAIMS>
Filter body arrangement having a multiplicity of 
elongated filter bodies (18) which are open at a first end 

and closed at a second end (20) and are manufactured from a 

filter material, and having a carrying element (10) to which 
the first ends of the filter bodies (18) are attached and 

which, for its part, has at the rim a rim seal (14) by means 
of which its rim can be attached in a sealed manner to a 

filter casing (26), characterized in that the carrying 
element (10) consists of pliable material in which windows 

(12) covering the upper ends of the filter bodies (18) are 
provided. 
Filter body arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the material of the carrying element 

(10) is flexible. 
Filter body arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the material of the carrying element 

(10) is porous, the pore size of the said material being 
smaller than, or the same as, the pore size of the filter 

material. 
Filter body arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the material of the carrying element 

(10) is a textile filter media material, in particular a 
woven filter fabric. 
Filter body arrangement according to one of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the filter bodies (18) are 

embedded in a sealing layer (16) carried by the underside of 
the carrying element (10).  

 
Filter body arrangement according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the sealing layer has sealing frames 

(16') associated with the windows (12). 
Filter body arrangement according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the sealing layer (16) consists of 

porous material, the pore size of the said material 
preferably being smaller than, or the same as, the pore size 

of the filter material. 
Filter body arrangement according to one of claims 5 
to 7, characterized in that the material of the sealing 

layer (16) is soft. 
Filter body arrangement according to one of claims 5 
to 8, characterized in that the sealing layer (16) is thin, 

the filter bodies (18) are made from inherently rigid filter 
material and the rim sections of their upper end lie in a 

common plane. 
Filter body arrangement according to one of claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that the rim seal (14) is constituted 

by sealing material formed onto the rim of the carrying 
element (10). 
Filter body arrangement according to one of claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that the rim seal (14) has a sealing 

ring (46) sewn into, or fastened onto, a rim section of the 
carrying element (10). 
Filter body arrangement according to one of claims 1 
to 11, characterized in that a rim section (52) of the 

carrying element (10) and a main section (56) of the said 
carrying element (10) lie in planes which are mutually 

offset in an essentially parallel manner.  
 
Filter body arrangement according to claim 12, 
characterized in that a jolting part (58) working on the 

filter bodies (18) is distant, in its lower end position, 
from the filter bodies (18) by about half (y) of its working 

stroke, and half (y) of its working stroke is slightly 
smaller than the distance (x) between the mutually offset 

planes.
