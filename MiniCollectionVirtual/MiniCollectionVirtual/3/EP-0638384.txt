<ABSTRACT>
A cutting insert having a cutting head (1) and a coupling shank (2) 
integral at one end thereof with the cutting head (1) and including 

a screw 
threaded portion (4). The cutting insert is formed by a powder metallurgy 

process of compacting and sintering and the screw threaded portion (4) is 
constituted by a substantially cylindrical body having a pair of diametrically 

opposed, longitudinally truncated planar portions (5) interposed between 
substantially curved cylindrical portions (6) having arcuate surfaces 

on which 
there are formed a non-continuous screw thread (7), the arcuate surfaces 

extending between 50 to 85% of the total peripheral extent of the cylindrical 
body of which they form part. There is also disclosed a powder metallurgy 

process for manufacturing the cutting insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a replaceable cutting insert for use with 
a cutting tool in metalworking operations such as, for example, rotary 
cutting tools for use in milling and drilling. The invention relates particularly 
to such a cutting insert of the kind wherein an insert cutting head is 
formed integrally with a screw threaded coupling shank by means of which 
the insert can be releasably screw coupled to a tool holder. Furthermore the invention relates to a powder metallurgy process for 
manufacturing said cutting insert. Such cutting inserts with integrally formed screw threaded 
coupling shanks have long been known and form the subject, for example, 
of British Standard 122-Part 4. Such a cutting insert is also disclosed in 
French Patent Specification No. 2602162 which corresponds to the preamble 
of claim 1. Replaceable cutting inserts in general, and especially the cutting 
heads thereof, are usually formed of compacted sintered hard metals such as, 
for example, tungsten carbide with a suitable binder. The provision of such 
hard metal cutting heads with integrally formed screw threaded coupling 
shanks has not been hitherto proposed. It is clear that there are inherent 
difficulties in forming screw threading on a coupling shank formed by  
 
powder metallurgy techniques. Thus, any attempt to provide the coupling 
shank during a compacting process with the required screw threading, would 
invariably result in the production of a ridge of excess material in the region 
where two die punches approach each other. This is in view of the fact that 
the opposing edges of the die punches have to have a minimal thickness in 
order to avoid punch breakage. This ridge must clearly be removed by 
subsequent machining in order to allow for screw coupling. It has been proposed in US 5,248,474 to manufacture by hot 
isostatic pressing and sintering of metal powder, large diameter metal parts 
for use as electrodes for high temperature electric arc furnaces. Such metal 
parts are, after sintering, subjected to machining so as to form thereon 
suitable threading. Clearly, applying this concept of subsequent machining 
of an insert formed by a powdered metallurgy technique so as to impart to 
it appropriate threading would increase the costs of manufacture of the 
insert. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and 
improved cutting insert having an integral screw threaded coupling shank in 
which the above-referred-to difficulties are substantially reduced or 
overcome. According to the
