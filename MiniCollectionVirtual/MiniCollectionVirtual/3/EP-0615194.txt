<ABSTRACT>
Address and data transfers are performed among a plurality of 
different units (11,13,15) of a data processing system having a 

system bus (10) which includes an address bus (10A) and a data bus 
(10B), with the aid of an arbitration and address control unit (26) 

and a data control unit (27) . The system uses arbitration phase, 
address transfer phase, and data transfer phase operations, which 

require the use of unique handshake signals at each phase, so as to 
permit address and data transfers to occur on a suitable priority 

basis with respect to different ones of such units in a pipe-lined 
manner using non-multiplexed, asynchronous operations. The use of 

a non-multiplexed, asynchronous system bus permits new units with 
improved performance characteristics to be subsequently incorporated 

into the data processing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data processing 
systems using multiple processor boards and, more particularly, 
to such a system which uses a system address/data bus and 
system bus control. Many data processing systems use multiple processor boards for 
permitting the performance of different processing tasks 
simultaneously by different ones of the system's processors. Such 
systems require an appropriate commonly used system address/data 
bus and system bus control for handling address and data transfers 
between the processors and other units on the bus such as memory 
units and various input/output (I/O) devices. Such bus systems are 
normally controlled in a synchronous manner so that the 
interactions of the operations of such units can be effectively 
handled on the common bus system. Over time, various units on the 
bus may be redesigned to provide improved performance 
characteristics, e.g., the speeds of operation thereof may be 
improved so that operations can be completed more quickly, there  
 
often being several successive generations of such improved 
components. Such improvements normally require a substantially 
redesigned bus system in order to provide for the appropriate 
handling of address and data transfers among units having different 
operating speeds than those for which the bus system was originally 
designed. Moreover, in such synchronously operated systems, arbitration 
among units competing for access to the bus system for address and 
data transfers thereon must be completed for each unit in control 
of the bus before another unit can take control of the bus to 
perform its task or, alternatively, the operations of different 
units must be suitably synchronously interleaved so that one unit 
can make use of the bus system for address transfer, while another 
unit makes use of the bus for data transfer, neither operations 
being performed until priority among units competing for access to 
the bus system has been activated. It is desirable to provide a bus system and bus control 
therefor which does not require substantial redesign thereof as 
improved components become available for use with the bus system so 
that the bus system and its operation, once designed, can remain 
usable, and does not become obsolescent, for several successive  
 
generations of improved system component designs. Moreover, it is 
desirable to provide a bus system which can permit arbitration, 
address transfer, and data transfer operations to occur 
simultaneously for different processors
