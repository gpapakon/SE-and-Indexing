<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for compression molding plastic 
articles including closures which includes providing coacting 

sets of tools including a first set (27) for moving a core (41) and core 
sleeve (42) into engagement with a cavity mold on a second set of 

tooling (28) . An actuator is provided between the first set of 
tooling and a fixed upper cam (29). The second set of tooling (28)

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
compression molding plastic articles according to the
preamble of claims 1 and 31, respectively.In a known method and apparatus (EP-A-0 175 642 = US-A-4,735,761)
the tools are closed and a pressure fluid
cylinder is activated to apply the pressing force. The
molding pressing force therefore depends from such
parameters as fluid pressure, pressure drop during
actuation, and inertial forces from the masses moved. No
control means are disclosed to control the pressing force.A compression molding apparatus and method of the
preambles to claims 1 and 31 are known (EP-A-0 091 653). The
male mold is composed of an outer cylindrical member and an
inner member, the latter containing a sliding piece and a
piston fixed thereto which is under fluid pressure. When a
pressure detector on the end of the male mold senses an
excessive pressure acting on the plastic material in the
mold, the fluid pressure on the piston is taken away so that
the sliding piece can retract and increase the mold space so
reducing the molding pressure.It is common to compression mold plastic articles
including closures, as contrasted to injection molding
plastic articles. Typical patents comprise US-A-2,072,536,
2,155,316, 2,218,456, 2,402,462, 2,891,281, 3,210,805,
4,296,061, 4,314,799, 4,343,754, 4,355,759, 4,497,765,
4,640,673, 4,755,125.In the compression molding of plastic articles, there
are inherent variations that can affect the resultant
articles. One such variance is the manufacturing tolerance
applied to the tools. Accordingly, the molding sets on a
machine are not identical. Thus, when the tools are made up
in the molding psoition, the volume of the space between the
molding surfaces varies between mold sets. A further 
variance is the weight and/or volume of the plastic charge
that is placed within each mold set.Among the objectives of the present invention are to
provide a method and apparatus for compression molding
plastic articles including closures wherein the forming
pressure can be accurately controlled; wherein the forming
pressure can be readily adjusted; wherein lateral forces on
the tooling are not applied directly to the forming tool;
wherein the tooling may be readily replaced; wherein the
number and size of tool stations can be readily changed; and
wherein various kinds and sizes of articles including
closures can be readily made by changing the tooling and
associated actuating mechanism; wherein the tooling will
compensate for variations in pellet or charge
