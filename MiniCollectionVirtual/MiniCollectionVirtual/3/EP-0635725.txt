<ABSTRACT>
The electronic device comprises capacitive couplers (1) coupled to electrical conductors, which supply alternating currents (I) at very low strength. These currents are used by voltage detectors and by phase detectors associated with each conductor. The voltage and phase detectors supply a light pulse respectively at each n period and at each period of the said alternating current. The two series of pulses are then transferred by means of optical fibre cables (2, 4) to an accessible site, at a safe distance, where the first is used directly to verify the presence of voltage on the conductor visually, and the second is used indirectly, with the aid of a phase comparator device (PSC), to check the phase-shift with respect to a series of similar pulses relating to the other conductor.
