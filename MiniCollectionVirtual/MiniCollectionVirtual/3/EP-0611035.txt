<ABSTRACT>
A device for generating intermittent motion has two 
members (1,2; 12,13) which mutually telescope. The inner 

member (1,13) has an external non-helical track (4,5; 7) 
which steps, zig-zags or undulates and with which a follower 

(6) on the interior of the outer member (2; 12) co-operates. 
The mutual telescoping is therefore forced to take an uneven 

course. When incorporated in a dispensing device, such as a 
medical injector, the track geometry can be designed to give 

measured, intermittent doses from a single capsule. A quick-return 
track 8 can be provided to bring the members back to 

the initial position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns devices for generating 
intermittent motion. It may have many applications, but it 
originated in the context of mixing or dispensing where a 
capsule needed to be squeezed, but where a continuous 
pressure did not always suit. For example, it might allow 
too rapid an action, or it could be difficult to sustain. 
For some operations, it may be advantageous to break up 
squeezing into periods of pressure interposed with periods 
of relaxation. According to the present invention there is 
provided a device for generating intermittent or non-uniform 
motion comprising two mutually telescoped members, the 
interior of the outer member and the exterior of the inner 
member having co-operating guide formations whereby the 
extent of telescoping is adjustable by mutually rotating the 
members about their common axis and by mutually shifting the 
members axially, the rotation and axial shifting either 
being separate operations or having a variable relationship. For separate operations, in one preferred form 
the guide formations comprise annular ribs with gaps on one 
member, and a projection on the other member engageable 
between any adjacent pair of ribs and passable through said 
gaps. There could be a plurality of such projections, in 
which case they will be arranged to register with different 
gaps simultaneously. For ease of construction, it will 
generally be preferred to have the annular ribs on the inner  
 
member and the or each projection on the outer one. Alternatively, the guide formations may comprise 
a track in one member with alternating portions having 
angled transitions between them, and a follower on the other 
member engaged with the track. The alternating portions may 
be circumferential and axially parallel, forming a stepped 
track. This could follow the general line of a helix, 
winding around said one member, or it could be of embattled 
form, following a generally straight path. In other 
arrangements, the portions may be symmetrically helical one 
way and then the other, or the track may be of asymmetric 
saw tooth form. In all these cases, the track is 
conveniently a channel, and the follower is a projection, or 
more than one projection, that engages in the channel. 
Again, it will usually be preferred to have the track on the 
inner member and the or each projection on the outer one. The guide formations could alternatively comprise 
a non-helical but smoothly curved track in one member and a 
follower on the other member engaged with the track.

<CLAIMS>
A device for generating intermittent or non-uniform 
motion comprising two mutually telescoped members, 

(1,2; 12,13) the interior of the outer member (2,12) and the 
exterior of the inner member (1,13) having co-operating 

guide formations whereby the extent of telescoping is 
adjustable by mutually rotating the members about their 

common axis, and by mutually shifting the members axially, 
the rotation and axial shifting either being separate 

operations or having a variable relationship. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the guide formations comprise annular ribs (3) with 

gaps (4) on one member (1) and a projection (6) on the other 
member (2) engageable between any adjacent pair of ribs (3) 

and passable through said gaps (4). 
A device as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that the annular ribs (3) are on the inner member (1) and 

the projection (6) is on the outer member (2). 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the guide formations comprise a track (7) in one member 

(1) with alternating portions having angled transitions 
between them, and a follower on the other member engaged 

with the track. 
A device as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in 
that the alternating portions are circumferential and 

axially parallel, forming a stepped track. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the guide formations comprise a non-helical but 

 
smoothly curved track in one member and a follower on the 

other member engaged with the track. 
A device as claimed in Claim 5, 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the track (7) is confined between 

radii from the axis of the device and wherein a further 
substantially straight and axially parallel track (8) 

receptive to the follower is provided in said one member 
outside those radii and is in communi
cation at least at one 
end with the first track (7), whereby reverse telescoping 

motion is substantially direct, without significant mutual 
twisting of said member. 
A device as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in 
that the further track (8) is in communication with the 

first track (7) at both ends. 
A device as claimed in Claim 7 or 8, characterised 
in that non-return means (11) allow the follower (6) to pass 

from the straight track (8) to the first track (7) at the 
other end but not to reverse that movement. 
A dispensing device comprising a device as claimed 
in any preceding claim in which the two members (12,13) are 

adapted to contain a charge that is compressed axially when 
the two members (12,13) are telescoped together by the 

mutual rotation and axial shifting, and which is thereby 
dispensed in non-uniform manner from one end (15) of the 

device.
