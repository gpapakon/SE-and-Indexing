<ABSTRACT>
An optical element module includes a stem 
(30) on
 which a laser diode (40) and a first lens (62) 
for converting emitted light of the laser diode to 

parallel light or spurious parallel light are mounted, 
a second lens (70) for focusing the parallel light or 

the spurious parallel light converted by said first 
lens, an optical fiber (84) optically coupled to the 

laser diode by means of the first and second lenses, 
and a package for accommodating and fixing the above 

elements. The laser diode constitutes an optical 
element. The stem includes a step having a dimension 

such that the laser diode is coincident with the optical 
axis of the first lens. The first lens is fixedly 

mounted in a lens holder, which is fixedly mounted in 
contact with a vertical surface of the step. A dimension 

between a surface of the step abutting against the 
lens holder and a fixed position of the first lens is 

set to be equal to a space suitable for conversion of 
the emitted light of the laser diode to the parallel 

light or the spurious parallel light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates an optical
element module such as a laser diode module, a semiconductor
optical amplifier module, an external modulator
module and a receiving module for optical communication.In order to optically couple an optical
element to an optical fiber when an optical element is,
for example, a laser diode, in a conventional laser
diode module using a lens optical coupling system
including a first lens for converting emitted light of
the laser diode to parallel light or spurious (or
quasi) parallel light and a second lens for focusing
the parallel light or the spurious parallel light to
couple the light to the optical fiber, the accuracy of
the space between the laser diode and the first lens
and the space between the first lens and the second
lens is set roughly, as described in JP-A-3-245111, in
order to reduce an assembly cost.Reference may be further made to JP-A-60-8812
and U.S. Patent No. 5,128,956. The Japanese Patent Abstract corresponding to JP-A-05055609 discloses an
optical module which is provided with a light emitting element, a condensing
lens and further optical elements for coupling out the light emitted by
the light emitting element. The light emitting element and the condensing
lens are mounted on a stem whereby a certain distance therebetween has to
be adjusted.The Japanese Patent Abstract of JP-A-58021890 discloses a further optical
fiber mounting device comprising an optical element which is aligned to an
optical waveguide via a lens mounted on a lens mounting unit.In the above prior art, the assembly cost can be reduced since the positional
accuracy for fixing 
the first and second lenses is set roughly, while it is
difficult to obtain the maximum light coupling efficiency
since a deviation from the maximum coupling
state is large and it is further difficult to obtain
the optical element module capable of stably producing
a large optical output with high yield. In addition,
it is necessary to provide a large position adjustment
range of the optical fiber in order to correct the
deviation of the optical axis.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an optical element module which solves the
problems of the prior art described above.It is another object of the present invention
to provide an optical element module improved to
ensure that an optical element such as a laser diode
and a first lens are positioned to the optimum coupling
state without positional adjustment.These objects are achieved according to the features of
Claims 1 and 8,
