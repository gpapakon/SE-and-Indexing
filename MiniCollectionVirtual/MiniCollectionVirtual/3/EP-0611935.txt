<ABSTRACT>
A krypton/xenon enriched stream is obtained directly 
from the low pressure column (D2) in a cryogenic air 

separation process by bypassing (26,30) the bottom few 
trays of said column to reduce the liquid to vapor ratio 

therein. Krypton and xenon are concentrated in the sump 
while the majority of methane is removed with a gaseous 

oxygen product (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
cryogenic distillation of air into its constituent 
components wherein a stream enriched in krypton and xenon 
is produced directly from the main air distillation column and to an apparatus for the cryogenic distillation of an air feed according to such a process. Krypton and xenon are present in air as trace 
components, 1.14 parts per million by volume (1.14 vppm) 
and 0.086 vppm, respectively, and can be produced in pure 
form from the cryogenic distillation of air. Both of these 
elements are less volatile (i.e., have a higher boiling 
temperature) than oxygen and therefore concentrate in the 
liquid oxygen sump of a conventional double column air 
separation unit. Other impurities which are also less 
volatile than oxygen (most notably methane) also 
concentrate in the liquid oxygen sump along with krypton 
and xenon. Unfortunately, process streams containing oxygen, 
methane, krypton and xenon present a safety problem due to 
the combined presence of methane and oxygen. Methane and 
oxygen form flammable mixtures with a lower flammability 
limit of 5% methane in oxygen. In order to operate safely, 
the methane concentration in an oxygen stream must not be 
allowed to reach the lower flammability limit and, in 
practice, a maximum allowable methane concentration is set 
that is a fraction of the lower flammability limit. This 
maximum constraint effectively limits the concentration of 
the krypton and xenon that is attainable in the sump as any 
further concentration of these products would also result 
in a methane concentration exceeding the maximum allowed.  
 The conventional technology accepts this limitation on 
the concentration of the krypton and xenon that is 
attainable in the liquid oxygen boiling in the sump and 
removes methane in a separate distillation column 
(typically referred to in the art as the raw krypton/xenon 
column) so that further concentrating of the krypton and 
xenon in the liquid oxygen stream (usually via 
distillation) can safely be performed. See for example the 
processes taught in US-A-3,751,934; US-A-4,568,528; US-A-5,063,746; 
US-A-5,067,976; and US-A-5,122,173. US-A-3,751,934 discloses an air separation process in 
which oxygen containing krypton, xenon and hydrocarbons is 
passed from a rectifying column to a separator where it is 
washed, as a rising gas, with a downflow of liquid oxygen 
drawn from above the sump liquid in the rectifying column. 
Gaseous oxygen and methane leave the separator as an 
overhea

comprising a high pressure column (D1) and a low pressure 
column (D2) wherein:
