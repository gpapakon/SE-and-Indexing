<ABSTRACT>
An IDC terminal comprises a contact body (10) and a 
back-up spring (12) having an IDC back-up portion (44) for 

resiliently supporting IDC contacts (36). The back-up 
spring (12) further has a contact spring section (42) comprising 

bowed-in resilient beams (48) supported at both ends 
in cavities (24,26), respectively, formed in side walls (22) 

of the contact body (10). The contact spring section (42) 
forms a top wall of the contact section (4) of the contact 

body (10) and provides a very high spring force against a 
complementary male mating tab inserted into the contact 

section (4). The IDC back-up portion (44) comprises a 
central reinforcing rib (62) for increasing the spring 

strength thereof, whereby positioning the IDC back-up portion 
(44) within the IDC contact section (28), provides for a 

very compact design. Due to the use of a back-up spring, 
the contact material can be optimally chosen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical terminal
having an insulation displacement contact section
reinforced with a back-up spring.Insulation displacement contacts (IDC) are
increasingly common in the electrical industry because
they allow simultaneous termination of a plurality of
terminals to respective conducting wires in a simple
automated procedure whereby the wires do not need to be
stripped and are simply forced into IDC slots with a
stuffer tool. There is a rapidly rising demand,
particularly in the automobile industry, for electrical
terminals that can be assembled in an automated procedure,
whilst the electrical current carrying capability,
reliability, compactness and robustness are also subject
to challenging requirements.Some of the important factors determining the current
carrying capability of a terminal is the conductivity of
the metal from which the contact is formed, and the
contact resistance between mating terminals or between the
conducting wire and terminal. The latter is largely
determined by the contact pressure exerted therebetween
which in turn is determined by the spring forces that
engage the contact surfaces together. Unfortunately, the
sheet metal commonly used for producing electrical
terminals usually decreases in resiliency as the
conductivity and ductility increases. Additionally, there
is also an increase in the creep properties i.e. stress
relaxation of the material over time and as a function of
temperature and stress. The latter is aggravated by the
requirement to produce compact terminals having small
material cross-sections engendering high resistance and
therefore high temperatures during the passage of
electrical current, whereby the high temperatures greatly 
increase the rate of creep of the metal.It is known in the prior art to increase the
contact pressure between mating terminals by providing
a back-up spring made of a resilient temperature
resistant material such as steel, that provides added
resilient forces stable over time and at operating
temperatures. one of the problems with some of these
terminals with back-up springs, is that the back-up
spring only participates in providing the overall
contact pressure, whereby the contact body itself
provides the remaining force and the contact material
must therefore be sufficiently resilient which in turn
decreases the conductive properties thereof. In the
prior art, sufficient resiliency of the contact material
is also required to provide a suitable connection
between the IDC slots and the conducting wire
