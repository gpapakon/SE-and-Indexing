<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a ceramic heater
having better anti thermal shock property. A ceramic

substrate 12 is formed by providing heat generation bodies 14a
and 14b on the surface of a green sheet made from a slurry

containing powdered ceramics, sandwiching the green sheet with
other green sheets from both upper and lower sides and then

laminating and pressing the compiled green sheets. At least
some of the heat generation bodies 14a and 14b are disposed on a

level P1b offset from a level P1a of other heat generation
bodies in the direction of thickness of the ceramic substrate

12.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic heater, and
more particularly to a ceramic heater for use in production and
inspection processes of semiconductors.Applied semiconductor products are indispensable in
many industrial fields. As a typical example, semiconductor
chips are produced by slicing a silicon monocrystalline to a
predetermined thickness to produce a silicon wafer, on which
are formed a variety of circuits.In the production process of such variety of circuits,
high frequency spattering technique or plasma etching
technique may be used for heating the silicon wafer in order to
form components such as conductive thin films thereon. In
order to successfully achieve the high frequency spattering or
plasma etching, ceramic heaters have been become popular in
recent years, which is made of sintered ceramic materials. As a type of ceramic heater, one incorporating a
resistive heat-generation body (referred to as a heat
generation body herein below) within a ceramic substrate,
called a ceramic heater of built-in heat generation body type,
is well known in the art. Referring to Fig. 13, which shows an
example of a ceramic substrate 202 of a ceramic heater 200 in a
cross-sectional view, the section was made in a plane normal to
the longitudinal axis of a heat generation body 204 having a
flat-profile.As shown in Fig. 13, the ceramic heater 200, with a
heat generation body built-in, has heat generation bodies 204
made of conductive material formed together on the same plane P
in a predetermined pattern within the ceramic substrate 202,
some recesses 206 are provided for part of some of respective
heat generation bodies 204 in order to attach, to the recesses
206, a terminal (not shown in the figure) for connecting to a
power supply (not shown in the figure), which is connected to
the terminal through a wiring.The ceramic substrate 202 incorporating such heat
generation bodies 204, may be produced by using a method of
obtaining a ceramic substrate by laminating and pressurizing
and baking green sheets made of slurry including powdered
ceramic materials. On a surface of a green sheet, heat
generation bodies are disposed in accordance with a given 
pattern specified, then the green sheet with heat generation
bodies disposed may be appropriately sandwiched by a plurality
of green sheets on both upper and bottom sides to pressurize and
bake them together.Thus obtained ceramic substrate is used as a heater
core to form a heater device by disposing the heater substrate
at the upper opening of a casing with
