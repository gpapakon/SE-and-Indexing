<ABSTRACT>
A method and medicament for the inhibition of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in mammals comprising administering a treatment effective amount of 2-O-desulfated heparin to a mammal in need thereof. The medicament preferably is administered by aerosolization or by intravenous (IV) injection. In specific embodiments of the invention, the ratio of 2-O-desulfated heparin to elastase is greater than about 0.2 and less than about 2.0, or the ratio of 2-O-desulfated heparin to cathepsin G is greater than about 0.4 and less than about 2.0. Preferably, the 2-O-desulfated heparin medicament includes a physiologically acceptable carrier which may be selected from the group consisting of physiologically buffered saline, normal saline, and distilled water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a desulfated heparin and its use in medical
treatment of mammals.Activated neutrophils play an important role in
a number of human and other mammalian diseases by releasing
a number of oxidant chemicals and enzymes after migration
into an affected organ. While oxidants, such as superoxide
anion, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid are
injurious by themselves, the major destructive elements
produced by activated neutrophils are cationic proteases,
the bulk of which consist of elastase and cathepsin G.
When neutrophils release these proteases, tissue
destruction occurs unless the proteases are neutralized by
sufficient extracellular anti-proteinases such as α-1-anti-proteinase.Individuals with an inherited deficiency of α-1-anti-proteinase
suffer unimpeded proteolytic lung
destruction over a lifetime, resulting ultimately in the
development of pulmonary emphysema. Cigarette smoking
causes the influx of activated leukocytes into the lung,
with subsequent degranulation and release of proteases.
Cigarette derived oxidants also inactivate α-1-anti-proteinase
by oxidizing an important methionine near the
active site. Elastase delivered to the alveolar lung unit
as a result of the influx due to cigarette smoking,
concurrent with oxidative inactivation of α-1-anti-proteinase
activity, produces an imbalance of
protease/anti-proteinase activity that is thought to be a
major cause of human emphysema from cigarette smoking.When the imbalance occurs within the airway,
chronic airway inflammation is the result, and neutrophil
derived elastase and cathepsin G are thought important in
the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis. If the imbalance
occurs within the pulmonary vasculature, the resulting
microvascular injury causes lung edema formation. In this
fashion the influx of activated leukocytes and release of 
elastase and other neutrophil proteases are major causes of
lung injury in the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
Neutrophil derived elastase is also an important cause of
proteolytic lung destruction in cystic fibrosis, a disease
characterized by intense mucopurulent bronchitis and some
of the highest levels of elastase activity measured in any
human disease.Also, diseases such as myocardial infarction and
stroke, caused by sudden loss of organ blood flow, followed
by blood flow restoration (ischemia-reperfusion injury) are
characterized by magnification of tissue destruction during
the reperfusion phase when activated leukocytes rapidly
invade the already injured tissue.
