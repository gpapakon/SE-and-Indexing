Assembly comprising a bulkhead (10) separating 
an engine compartment from a passenger compartment of a 

vehicle and a pneumatic booster (12) assisting the 
braking of the vehicle and comprising essentially a tube 

into which an operating rod (16) actuated by a brake 
pedal situated in the passenger compartment penetrates 

and a closed casing disposed in the engine compartment, 
the bulkhead (10) being provided with an opening formed 

for the passage of the tube (14) of the booster, the tube 
(14) being fastened to a collar (18) which has a diameter 

substantially smaller than that of the opening, the 
collar (18) having a peripheral groo
ve (38), characterized 
in that a ring (22) is housed in the peripheral 

groove (38) and has, at least in part, an elastic edge 
(24) projecting outwards, in such a manner that, when the 

booster is in position in the opening, the elastic edge 
(24) of the ring forms a spacer between the face of the 

bulkhead (10) situated in the passenger compartment and 
a radial wall of the peripheral groove (38). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that end of the collar (18) which is situated in the 

passenger compartment is provided with a screw thread 
(26) interacting with a nut (28). 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the radial wall of the peripheral groove (38) 

interacting with the elastic edge (24) of the ring (22) 
is formed on the nut (28). 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that face of the bulkhead (10) which is situated in the 

passenger compartment is provided with at least one 
circular rib (30) forming a stop for the elastic edge 

(24). 
Assembly according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the collar (18) has, at least 

partially an end wall (20) of substantially circular 
shape, a seal (36) being disposed between the end wall  

 
(20) and that face of the said bulkhead (10) which is 

situated in the engine compartment. 
Assembly according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the seal (36) exerts, on the rear face of the 

booster casing, a force directed towards the engine 
compartment. 
Assembly according to any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that a foolproof positioning system (32, 34) 

is provided between the end wall (20) of the collar and 
the bulkhead (10) in order to define a single relative 

angular position for fastening the booster on the bulkhead. 
Assembly according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the foolproof positioning system (32, 34) consists 

of a concave surface formed in the bulkhead (10) or in 
one wall of the booster interacting with a complementary 

convex surface formed in one wall of the booster or in 
the bulkhead (10) respectively. 
Assembly according to any of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the collar (18) is formed by the 

end of the casing 12, one wall of which constitutes the 
end wall (20).
