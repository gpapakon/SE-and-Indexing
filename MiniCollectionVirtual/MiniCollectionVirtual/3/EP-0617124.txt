<ABSTRACT>
Methods for the detection, monitoring and treatment 
of malignancies are disclosed. Detection of the proliferation 

of T cells in response to 
in vitr
o exposure to a protein 
expression product of an activated oncogene or cancer-related 

gene associated with a malignancy, or detection of 
immunocomplexes formed between the protein expression product 

and antibodies in body fluid, allows the diagnosis of the 
presence of a malignancy. The present invention also 

discloses methods and compositions for treating a malignancy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed
toward the detection, monitoring, and treatment of
malignancies through the use of a cancer patient's own
immune reactivity to the protein expression product of an
activated oncogene or cancer-related gene associated with
malignancy.Despite enormous investments of financial and
human resources, cancer remains one of the major causes of
death. A common characteristic of malignancies is
uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer cells appear to have
undergone a process of transformation from the normal
phenotype to a malignant phenotype capable of autonomous
growth. Mutation of somatic cell genes is considered to
be a common primary event that results in the
transformation of normal cells to malignant cells. The
malignant phenotypic characteristics encoded by the
mutated genes are passed on during cell division to the
progeny of the transformed cells. Various genes involved
with transformation have been designated as oncogenes.
Oncogenes were originally identified as components of the
genetic material of oncogenic viruses. The homologous
genes on human chromosomes are commonly termed oncogenes
or proto-oncogenes.Ongoing research involving oncogenes has
identified at least forty oncogenes operative in malignant
cells and responsible for, or associated with,
transformation. Oncogenes have been classified into
different groups based on the putative function or 
location of their gene products (such as the protein expressed by the oncogene) .Proto-oncogenes are believed to be essential for certain aspects of
normal cellular physiology. Certain proto-oncogenes appear to be activated to a
cellular oncogene through quantitative mechanisms that result from increased or
deregulated expression of an essentially normal gene product. For example, the myc
gene family has been associated with initiation and/or progression of certain human
lymphomas and carcinomas, whose transforming activation is the result of quantitative
mechanisms. Alternatively, other proto-oncogenes appear to be activated to
transforming cellular oncogenes through qualitative mechanisms, including mutation in
the coding sequence of the gene. This creates a gene product with an altered primary
structure and biochemical properties as a result of one or more differences in the
amino acid sequence of the protein. For example, the ras gene family, causally
associated with the most common forms of human malignancy (e.g., colon cancer) is
activated as a result of single codon changes.Studies to develop cancer therapies
