<ABSTRACT>
A right angle connector device (10) is provided which can hold conductive pins in proper place at a pin-bending step. A plastic housing (12) is molded with a plurality of conductive pins (22, 24) set in and relative to the plastic housing. The respective pins are L-shaped at the time of molding and, after the housing has been molded, have their outer short portions (22c, 24c) bent in a direction vertical to one surface of the housing. At the bending step, the pins, even if being stressed with a bending force, are rigidly fixed by the surrounding plastic and hence held in proper place in the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface mount connector device and a method for
manufacturing the same.EP-A-0 204 504 describes an electric connector. Generally, such a 2mm-pitch right
angle connector device is manufactured by inserting conductive pins into a once-molded
plastics housing and bending their end portions at an angle of 90Â° with respect to one housing
surface. These bent end portions of the pins serve as solder leads and are soldered to lands on
an associated printed circuit board.The connector device manufactured by a method using the pin insertion step is not
strong enough to hold the pins in place in the housing and is not stable. At the bending step
and subsequent steps, the connector device is not strong and rigid enough to hold the pins in a
proper place in the housingFurther, an assembling machine or tooling is required upon insertion of the pins into the
housing, thus involving a high manufacturing cost.It is accordingly the object of the present invention to provide a connector device and a
method for manufacturing the same which can adequately hold pins in a housing and, during a
bending process and at a subsequent step, ensure a positive positioning of pins in and relative
to the housing. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a connector device comprising:
an elongated housing made from molded resin material and having mutually opposite first
and second surface sections and a third surface section extending in a direction perpendicular
to the first and second surface sections and intended to be mounted directly to a surface of an
associated circuit board, during use, and a plurality of conductive pins set in place partly within
the housing during molding of the housing;the plurality of conductive pins at least including a plurality of first conductive pins
arranged as a single array along a length of the housing, each first conductive pin comprising a
first portion having one end situated outside the housing and another end situated inside the
housing, near the second surface section, said first portion extending from said one end
substantially perpendicular to the first surface section of the housing to said other end, a
second portion situated inside the housing forming substantially a right angle with the first
portion and extending from said other end of the first portion toward the third surface section
in a direction substantially parallel to the second surface section and a third portion projecting,
as an extension of the second portion, out of the
