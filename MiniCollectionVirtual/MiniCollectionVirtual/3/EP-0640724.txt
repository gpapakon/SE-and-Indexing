<ABSTRACT>
An excavator 1 has a boom 14 which is composed of three arm pieces 15 to 17 which are each pivotable individually by means of an allocated piston/cylinder unit 23 to 25. The centre piston/cylinder unit 24 runs virtually completely within the centre arm piece 16 and in this way is largely protected from damage due to striking an obstacle.

A construction machine, in particular an excavator vehicle,
comprising a frame (3) and a jib (14) having an arm portion (15) which is

pivotably mounted at the frame side and an outer arm portion (17) which
carries the working implement (18) and also pivotably mounted piston-cylinder

units (23 to 25) for individually pivoting the arm portions (15 to
17) and the working implement (18) with respect to the frame (3) and the arm

portion (15 to 17) adjacent at the frame side respectively, wherein at least
one piston-cylinder unit (24) is arranged entirely or predominantly within

an arm portion (16) having a hollow profile, characterised in that the jib
(14) has a central arm portion (16) with a hollow profile, which is

pivotably mounted between the inner arm portion (15) and the outer arm
portion (17) and which accommodates the piston-cylinder unit (24) for

pivotal movement of the central arm portion.
A construction machine according to claim 1 characterised in that
the piston-cylinder unit (24) accommodated by the arm portion (16) is

pivotably mounted thereto in the region of the outer or implement half of
the arm portion (16).
A construction machine according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that each arm portion (16) accommodating a piston-cylinder

unit (24) has a box-shaped hollow profile.
A construction machine according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the piston-cylinder unit (24) accommodated by the arm

portion (16) extends with its axis between the frame-side pivot axis (20) of
the arm portion (16) and the pivotal connecting axis (34) of the piston-cylinder 

unit (25) for pivoting the arm portion (17) adjacent at the
implement side.
A construction machine according to claim 4 characterised in that,
with the arm portion (16) which accommodates the piston-cylinder unit (24)

being oriented substantially horizontally the frame-side pivot axis (20) is
arranged beneath the axis of the piston-cylinder unit (24) accommodated by

the arm portion (16) and the pivotal connecting axis (34) of the piston-cylinder
unit (25) for pivoting the arm portion (17) which is adjacent at

the implement side is arranged above the axis of the piston-cylinder unit
(24).
A construction machine according to claim 4 or claim 5
characterised in that the arm portion (16) which accommodates the piston-cylinder

unit (24) has at the frame side two transversely extending lateral
mounting plates (37) between which extend the pivot axis (20) to the arm

portion (15) adjacent at the frame side and the pivotal connecting axis (34)
of the piston-cylinder unit (25) for pivoting the arm portion (17) which is

adjacent at the implement side.
A construction machine according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the jib (14) assumes a substantially straight position

when the piston-cylinder units (23 to 25) are retracted and a bent position
when the piston-cylinder units (23 to 25) are extended.
A construction machine according to one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that the inner arm portion (15) projects substantially

horizontally when the inner piston-cylinder unit (23) is retracted and
stands up substantially vertically when the inner piston-cylinder unit (23)

is extended.
