<ABSTRACT>
An external drum plotter including a generally cylindrical drum 
having a longitudinal axis of symmetry (12) and a cylindrical support 

surface disposed about the longitudinal axis, for supporting thereon in 
generally cylindrical configuration, recording material (14) to be 

written upon, apparatus for rotating the drum about the longitudinal 
axis, longitudinal track apparatus arranged parallel to the longitudinal 

axis; mounting apparatus (40) arranged for longitudinal riding movement 
on the track apparatus and parallel to the longitudinal axis and a 

multiplicity of laser diode writing assemblies (42) mounted on the track 
apparatus and arranged for writing engagement with the recording 

material while the recording material rotates and the mounting apparatus 
moves longitudinally parallel to the longitudinal axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plotters generally and 
more particularly to drum plotters for writing on direct write 
materials. There exists a wide variety of drum plotters, including 
generally speaking drum plotters wherein the source of writing 
energy is internal to or external of recording material to be 
written upon, which is maintained in a generally cylindrical 
configuration, during writing. In recent years direct write recording materials have 
been developed for use in plotters. These materials are 
distinguished from conventional recording materials in that they 
do not require photographic development. These materials do have 
the disadvantage that they require relatively high input energy 
levels for writing thereupon. The disclosures of the following prior art patents are 
hereby incorporated by reference. U.S. Patent 4,211,838 describes a method of high 
sensitivity imaging and imaging film therefor. Reference is made 
particularly to the patents and patent applications mentioned at 
column 1, lines 1 - 30. U.S. Patent 4,743,091 describes a two-dimensional laser 
diode array in which the laser diodes are arranged in a staggered 
pattern.  U.S. Patent 4,978,974 describes an image recorder with 
a linear laser diode array which is mounted to project the output 
of the diodes onto a thermally activated photosensitive material. U.S. Patent 4,520,472 describes beam expansion and 
relay optics for a laser diode array.  The present invention seeks to provide an external drum 
plotter which is particularly suitable for relatively high 
resolution, high energy, writing on direct right recording media. There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention an external drum plotter 
including a generally cylindrical drum having a longitudinal axis 
of symmetry and a cylindrical support surface disposed about the 
longitudinal axis, for supporting thereon in generally 
cylindrical configuration, recording material to be written upon, 
apparatus for rotating the drum about the longitudinal axis, 
longitudinal track apparatus arranged parallel to the 
longitudinal axis; mounting apparatus arranged for longitudinal 
riding movement on the track apparatus and parallel to the 
longitudinal axis and a multiplicity of laser diode writing 
assemblies mounted on the track apparatus and arranged for 
writing engagement with the recording material while the 
recording material rotates and the mounting apparatus moves 
longitudinally parallel to the longitudinal axis. In

<CLAIMS>
An external drum plotter comprising: 
   a generally cylindrical drum having a longitudinal axis 

of symmetry and a cylindrical support surface disposed about the 
longitudinal axis, for supporting thereon in generally 

cylindrical configuration, recording material to be written upon; 
   means for rotating the drum about the longitudinal 

axis; 
   longitudinal track means arranged parallel to the 

longitudinal axis; 
   mounting means arranged for longitudinal riding 

movement on the track means and parallel to the longitudinal 
axis; and 

   a multiplicity of laser diode writing assemblies 
mounted on the track means and arranged for writing engagement 

with the recording material while the recording material rotates 
and the mounting means moves longitudinally parallel to the 

longitudinal axis. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and wherein said 
multiplicity of laser diode writing assemblies is arranged for 

impingement on the recording material in a line configuration. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 2 and also 
comprising reading means, mounted on the mounting apparatus for 

motion therewith relative to the recording material for providing 
verification of correct writing by the multiplicity of laser 

 
diode writing assemblies. 
Apparatus according to all preceding claims and wherein 
resolution of writing on the recording medium can be selected by 

selecting the angle of the line configuration of impingement 
relative to the longitudinal axis. 
Apparatus according to all preceding claims and also 
comprising means for interlacing impingement of the multiplicity 

of laser diode writing assemblies for enhancement of resolution. 
Apparatus according to all preceding claims and 
wherein said multiplicity of laser diode writing assemblies is 

arranged in mutually offset pairs, each pair including a laser 
diode writing assembly which is oppositely inclined with respect 

to the other relative to the longitudinal axis so that they both 
impinge along the same line.
