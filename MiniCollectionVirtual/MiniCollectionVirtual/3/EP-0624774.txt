<ABSTRACT>
In the case of such a sub-caliber projectile, a so-called discarding sabot (10) is located between the barrel inner wall of the gun and the arrow-shaped projectile body (11) during firing. This discarding sabot (10), which is used in a known manner in order to enlarge the acceleration area, is composed of a discarding sabot body (16) and a discarding sabot casing (17). In order that the discarding sabot (10) can easily be released from the arrow-shaped projectile body (11) after the projectile (10, 11) emerges from the weapon barrel, the discarding sabot body (16) is segmented. The touching surfaces between the segments (23, 24, 25) on the one hand and between the arrow-shaped projectile body (11) and the segments (23, 24, 25) on the other hand lead to sealing problems. In order to overcome these sealing problems, special segmentation of the discarding sabot body (16) is provided, according to the invention, with longitudinal slots (22), which have a T-shaped cross-section at least in parts, and weak points (26) in the region of its internal diameter as well as a gas-tight seal with a sealing cap (41), which is partially in the form of a truncated cone and expands forwards, are provided with a terminating seal (42).

Releasable sabot (10) on a wing-stabilised sub-calibre projectile
(11) which is launched from a gun barrel having helical grooves,

containing:

a sabot body (16), in which the sub-calibre projectile (11) is
anchored, which is divisible into segments (23, 24, 25) and

which comprises a cartridge mounting point (49) and a rear end
section, and
a sabot casing (17), which is divisible into segments (35, 36, 37)
and which at least partially encases and penetrates the sub-calibre

projectile (11) and the sabot body (16), and
the sabot casing (17) comprises a sealing cap (41) which is
integrated with the rear end section of the sabot body (16) and a

final seal (42),
characterised in that

for for the purpose of segmentation and gastight sealing

the sabot body (16) comprises elongated slots (22) and nominal
breaking points (26) in such a manner that the nominal breaking

points (26) are arranged in the area of the inside diameter at the
end section of the sabot body (16),
the elongated slots (22) have in the area of the cartridge
mounting point (49) a T-shaped cross-section with two

shoulders (27) as additional sealing surfaces for the material of
the sabot casing (17) located in the elongated slots (22), and
the end part of the sabot body (16) is partially truncated with the
casing surface widening towards the front.
Sabot (10) according to Claim 1,
characterised in that

the rear end section comprises an outwardly turned over end
surface (40) in the shape of a spherical zone and the sealing cap

(41), and the sabot body (16) is provided with a support ring (50)
for external support of the sealing cap (41). 
Sabot according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the final
seal (42) comprises an annular web (44) which protrudes into an

axially oriented safety groove (45) of the sabot body (16).
Sabot according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the final seal
(42) abuts partially a thread (14) of the sub-calibre projectile (11)

and partially a smooth cylinder surface (46) of the sub-calibre
projectile (11) adjacent the thread (14).
Sabot according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the part of the
final seal (42) which abuts the thread (14) is designed as a

rearwardly protruding cylindrical section (47).
