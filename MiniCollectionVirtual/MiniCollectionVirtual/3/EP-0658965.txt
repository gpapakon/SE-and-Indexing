<ABSTRACT>
Cable-clamp collar for raceways of the type 
consisting of an element in strip form made of rigid or 

semi-rigid plastics material with a U-shaped profile, 
comprising a base section, two lateral arms and two 

cable-retention limbs at the free ends of the said 
lateral arms, the said base section being provided with 

at least one hole for connection to the base of the 
raceway; this collar has at least one means for attaching 

the collar to the raceway, which is integral with the 
collar, disposed in the position of the said hole, and 

connected to the latter by means of thin bridges which 
are broken at the moment of attachment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable retention 
element or collar to be attached inside a cable-holder 
raceway, or a cable wiring raceway, and consists 
essentially of an element in strip form made of rigid or 
semi-rigid plastics material, with a U-shaped profile, in 
which the upper ends of the U arms extend inwards and 
downwards with a substantially C-shaped profile. Currently, collars of this type are secured to 
the base of the raceways by means of stud elements which 
are not integral with the collars, and are inserted in 
slots which exist in the base of the raceways and in 
holes which exist in the base section of the collars. However, attachment by this means has a certain 
number of disadvantages: firstly these studs, which are 
separate from the collars, can easily be lost, or can 
slip when being fitted, thus causing problems to the 
fitters. In addition, these studs are essentially rigid 
elements, and as such do not ensure flexible locking of 
the collar on the raceway. Another problem involves the 
stability of the collar inside the raceway, in particular 
when the cables are rearranged in the raceway, for 
example for maintenance purposes. However the collars 
according to the state of the art do not prevent rotation 
around the pins by means of which they are attached to 
the raceway, thus detracting from the efficiency of 
retention of the cables. In order to eliminate these and other disadvantages, 
the object of the present invention is a cable-clamp 
collar for raceways, in which the said collar has 
means for attaching the collar to the raceway, which are 
integral with the collar, disposed in the position of the 
holes, and connected to the latter by means of thin  
 
bridges which are broken at the moment of attachment. According to a further feature of the invention, 
the said attachment means are studs which consist of a 
head, a shaft and a foot, the head being provided with 
flexible fins which ensure that the said studs are locked 
flexibly. A further object of the present invention is 
collars which are provided on the inner surface of their 
base, with projections which are inserted in the slots 
which exist in the base of the raceway, and which prevent 
the collars from rotating inside the raceway. Further advantages and features of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following 
detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, produced by way of non-limiting example, with 
reference to the attached drawings, in which:

Cable-clamp collar for raceways of the type 
consisting of an element in strip form made of rigid or 

semi-rigid plastics material, with a U-shaped profile, 
comprising a base section (101), two lateral arms (201) 

and two cable-retention limbs (401) in the form of two 
arms which extend towards the inside of the free ends of 

the lateral arms, this base section (101) being provided 
with at least one hole (121) for connection of the collar 

to the base of the raceway (2), characterized in that the 
collar (1) has at least one means (301) for attaching the 

collar to the raceway, which is integral with the collar, 
disposed in the position of the hole (121), and connected 

to the latter by means of thin bridges (131) which are 
broken at the moment of attachment. 
Cable-clamp collar according to Claim 1, in which 
the attachment means are studs (301), comprising a head 

(331), a shaft (351) and a foot (341), the head being 
provided with flexible fins (311). 
Cable-clamp collar according to Claims 1 and 2, 
in which the head (331) of the studs (301) has a recess 

(361) for insertion of a tool. 
Cable-clamp collar according to the preceding 
claims, in which two projections (141), which are perpendicular 

to the plane of the base (101), are provided on 
the lower surface of the base (101) of the collar (1), on 

the perimeter edge of the hole (121)
