 LIPOPHILIC OLIGOSACCHARIDE ANTIBIOTIC SALT COMPOSITIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis inveriion relates to novel compositions of matter comprising a lipophilic oligosaccharide antibiotic, and to pharmaceutical formulations containing such compositions of matter and to methods of making and using such pharmaceutical compositions to treat and/or prevent microbial infections in animals especially mammals such as human beings. Lipophilic oligosaccharide antibiotics including, for example, everninomicins, curamy ins, avilamycins and flambamycins are members of the orthosomycin family of antibiotics which contain at least one acidic phenolic hydrogen, and two orthoester linkages associated with carbohydrate residues. See for example, A.K. Ganguly in "Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", (1978,, Volume 2, pp. 205-209, Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons and W.D. Oliis, et al.. Tetrahedron (1979), Volume 35, pp. 105-127. These lipophilic oligosaccharide antibiotics exhibit broad spectrum biological activity against gram positive and some gram negative bacteria in various in vitro assays, and in-vivo activity in animal models such as mice, but to date no pharmaceutically acceptable formulation of such antibiotics useful for in vivo administraiion has been available. Thus, we have observed that injection of these lipophilic oligosaccharide antibiotics cause an adverse reaction syndrome. The term "adverse reaction syndrome" as used herein means symptoms of the following type observed in animals such as mice upon parenteral administration of lipophilic oligosaccharide antibiotics: incoordination, ataxia, lateral recumbency, urination, hind leg rigidity, labored breathing, and arrest. Thus, in summary, there are no known pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of these lipophilic oligosaccharide antibiotics for the safe and effective use of these potent antibiotics in animals including mammals such as human beings.Cyclodextrins are modified starches made from glucopyranose units and include α-cyclodextrin consisting of six glucopyranose units, β- cyclodextrin consisting of seven glucopyranose units, and γ-cyclodextrin 

 consisting of eight glucopyranose units. The α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins and derivatives thereof have an inside surface or cavity which is lipophilic and an outer surface which is hydrophilic. This combination of a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface has led to the use of cyclodextrins and derivatives thereof for the molecular complexation or encapsulation of many
