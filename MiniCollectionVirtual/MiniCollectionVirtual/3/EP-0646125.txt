<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nucleoside analogues with an
aglycone six-membered ring which exhibits remarkable
antiviral activities. This invention further relates to the
chemical synthesis and the pharmaceutical and/or medical use
of such nucleoside analogues.Pentofuranosyl nucleosides are nucleosides in which a
pentofuranose ring, that is, a heterocyclic five-membered
ring, which is derived from pentose sugars, is bonded to the
heterocyclic ring of a pyrimidine or purine base.
Substituents can be present on each of both rings. Ring
atoms as well as pendant hydroxy and amino groups can be
replaced by other atoms or groups whereby a large number of
possible variations is created.Different pentofuranosyl nucleosides are known for
their anti-viral activities. Nucleosides for example with a
2-deoxy-2-fluor-D-arabinofuranose moiety have a potential
anti-viral activity against herpes viruses and are among the
most active anti-herpes agents. Compare De Clercq et al.,
Biochem. Pharmacol. 33, 2159 (1984). A number of these
nucleosides has already been tested in vivo. Their antiviral
activity is dependent on the presence of a virus-specific
thymidine kinase, whereby they are converted into the
corresponding 5'-monophosphate derivatives. The
monophosphates are further phosphorylized by cellular
enzymes to triphosphates which then inhibit the viral DNA
polymerase.In the same manner base modifications of the natural
2'-deoxy nucleosides can provide these nucleotides with an
anti-viral activity against herpes viruses. This activity of
for instance 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and E-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine
is likewise dependent on a virus-specific 
thymidine kinase. Compare De Clercq et al., in Developments
in Anti-viral Chemotherapy, pages 21-42 (1980), Ed. Collier
and Oxford, Acad. Press.The present invention relates to 1,5-anhydrohexitol
nucleoside analogues, wherein a 4-substituted-2,3,4-tri-deoxy-1,5-anhydrohexitol
is coupled via its 2-position to
the heterocyclic ring of a pyrimidine or purine base. They
are represented by the formula I:

wherein B is a heterocyclic ring which is derived from a
pyrimidine or purine base, and

wherein X represents a hydrogen atom, azido, F, Cl, Br, I,
amino, -NHR2, -N(R2)2, -OR2, -SR2 or CN,

   wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and represent
hydrogen, alkyl, acyl or phosphate groups;
wherein

      alkyl is a straight or branched chain, saturated
or unsaturated, substituted or non-substituted
hydrocarbon radical with 1-20 carbon atoms; and
acyl is an alkanoyl or aroyl
