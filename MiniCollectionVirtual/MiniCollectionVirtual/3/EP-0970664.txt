<ABSTRACT>
The support structure to act in a radial expansion action has at least one further part-structure (11) without an axial break between the ends of the tubular body. The first part-structure (1,2) can stretch at least radially, with separate radial stretch units (12,13) as rings or in a ring shape, while the second part-structure (11) is virtually rigid in the axial direction. Additionally or alternatively, both part-structures (1,2,11) are arranged so that, on a radial expansion of the tubular body, the second part-structure takes up the longitudinal axial forces.

Radially expandable support structure for keeping open lumina within a body, in particular a blood vessel, comprising a tubular body (3) having at least two part structures, with a wall surface which extends between a first (4) and a second end (5) and has a plurality of cut-out areas (6, 7, 8, 9), in particular slots, which are substantially oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular body,

- wherein at least a second part structure (11) runs without interruption in the axial direction at least virtually from the first to the second end of the tubular body, the first part structure (1, 2) is expandable at least in the radial direction and has at least one radial-expansion component which comprises radial expansion elements wherein the individual radial expansion elements (12, 13) are arranged as rings or annularly and the second part structure (11) is virtually rigid in the axial direction and
- wherein the two part structure (1, 2; 11) are arranged in such a way that on radial expansion of the tubular body, the second part structure(s) (11) absorbs/absorb the longitudinal axial forces occurring in the process, the first part structure (1, 2) and the second part structure(s) each have at least one meandering pattern (12, 13), the meandering pattern (12, 13) of the first part structure (1, 2) being a double meandering pattern, consisting of a first meandering pattern (12) with loops and second meandering pattern (13) with larger or smaller loops in comparison to the loops of the first meandering pattern.
Support structure according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at least one connection type (10) engaging in each case on the longitudinal ends of the first radial expansion elements (12) is configured as a loop-shaped web.
Support structure according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the wall surface has a substantial uniform thickness.
