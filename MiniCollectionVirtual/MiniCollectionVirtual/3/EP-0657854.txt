<ABSTRACT>
An electronic postage meter includes a printing unit 
which is responsive to a plurality of motors (552) for 

printing postage indicia in response to control circuit. 
The control circuit is comprised of a programmable 

microprocessor (13) in bus communication with an 
accounting means having memory units (MU) for accounting 

for the postage printed by the printing unit responsive 
to the programming of the microprocessor (13). An 

integrated circuit (15) includes an address decoding 
module (20) for generating a unique combination of 

control signals in response to a respective address 
placed on the bus (18) by the microprocessor (13). A 

timer register is responsive to ones of the control 
signals from the address decoding module (20) to enable 

writing of the timer data into the timer registers by the 
microprocessor (13). The timer unit is responsive to the 

timer data for generating one of a plurality of timing 
signal in accordance with timer data. The data also 

includes motor data. Motor register units are responsive 
to other ones of the control signals from the address 

decoding module (20) to enable writing of the motor data 
into the timer registers by the microprocessor (13). A 

motor control unit is responsive to the motor data for 

generating a plurality of motor control signals in 
accordance with the motor data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system
for an electronic postage metering system.European patent applications of even date are filed
concurrently herewith corresponding to the following US
applications commonly assigned to Pitney Bowes Inc.: US
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,627, entitled
MULTIPLE PULSE WIDTH MODULATION CIRCUIT; US Patent
Application Serial No. 08/165,134, entitled DUAL MODE
TIMER-COUNTER; US Patent Application Serial No.
08/137,460, entitled DYNAMICALLY PROGRAMMABLE TIMER-COUNTER;
US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,774,
entitled MEMORY ACCESS PROTECTION CIRCUIT WITH ENCRYPTION
KEY; US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,811,
entitled MEMORY MONITORING CIRCUIT FOR DETECTING
UNAUTHORIZED MEMORY ACCESS; US Patent Application Serial
No. 08/163,771, entitled MULTI-MEMORY ACCESS LIMITING
CIRCUIT FOR A MULTI-MEMORY DEVICE; US Patent Application
Serial No. 08/163,790, entitled ADDRESS DECODER WITH
MEMORY ALLOCATION FOR A MICRO-CONTROLLER SYSTEM; US
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,810, entitled
INTERRUPT CONTROLLER FOR AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT; US Patent
Application Serial No. 08/163,812, entitled ADDRESS
DECODER WITH MEMORY WAIT STATE CIRCUIT; US Patent
Application Serial No. 08/163,813, entitled ADDRESS
DECODER WITH MEMORY ALLOCATION AND ILLEGAL ADDRESS
DETECTION FOR A MICRO-CONTROLLER SYSTEM; and US Patent
Application Serial No. 08/163,629, entitled CONTROL
SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRONIC POSTAGE METER HAVING A
PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT.The disclosures of these European applications are
hereby incorporated herein by this reference.It is conventional to design a unique control system
for each module of an electronic postage metering system.
The control system is configured to meet the needs of the
particular model of postage metering system in a cost 
efficient manner.
The conventional electronic postage meter is comprised of a programmable
microprocessor, a plurality of memory units and an application specific integrated
circuit (ASIC). The ASIC function is to generate a plurality of system control signals
in response to address instruction from the microprocessor. It is therefore
conventional to design the ASIC to operate synchronously with the microprocessor.
For example, a high speed electronic postage meter control system may include a 32
megahertz microprocessor and compatible application specific integrated circuit. In
contrast, a less complex electronic postage meter control system, like that of the
Pitney Bowes model 6900 Postage Meter,
