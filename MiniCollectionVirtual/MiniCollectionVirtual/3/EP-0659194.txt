<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for (co)polymerizing vinyl monomers in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator, characterized in that said radical polymerization initiator is a 3-methylpentyl-3-peroxy alkanoate of formula (I) wherein R1, R2 and R3 represent alkyl groups each having at most 9 carbon atoms with the proviso that the total number of carbon atoms of R1, R2 and R3 is at most 11, said 3-methylpentyl-3-peroxy alkanoate being employed in an amount of 0.002 to 2.0 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of monomers present, said process being carried out at a temperature above 20  C. The use of 3-methylpentyl-3-peroxy alkanoates in the present invention surprisingly and unexpectedly results in a higher polymerization velocity, a shortened polymerization time, and an increase in conversion as compared with the results obtained by using other radical polymerization initiators. It has also been found that the obtained polymer has excellent thermal stability and is not affected by odour or coloration. Thus the industrial value of the radical polymerization initiator peroxide of the present invention is remarkably high.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for (co)polymerizing vinyl 
monomers in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator. Various t-alkylperoxy alkanoate compounds have been described as 
radical polymerization initiators in the (co)polymerization of vinyl 
monomers. U.S. patents 3,726,847 and 3,624,123 disclose a long list of t-alkylperoxy 
esters and their precursors, viz. hydroperoxides. The long 
list of hydroperoxides includes 3-methyl-3-hydroperoxy pentyne-1, 
which may also be used as a saturated hydroperoxide. These patent 
publications suggest that t-alkylperoxy esters can be used in the 
polymerization of vinyl monomers. Among others, t-butylperoxy pivalate 
(TBPP), t-butylperoxy neodecanoate (TX23), and α-cumylperoxy 
neodecanoate (CND) are exemplified. However, 3-methylpentyl-3-peroxy 
alkanoates are neither exemplified nor preferred. Dutch patent application 69 15160 discloses the use of t-hexylperoxy 
alkanoate for the polymerization and/or curing of vinyl monomers. No 
specifics are given on the structure of this t-hexyl compound. 
However, from U.S. patents 4,057,567 and 4,063,013 it can be concluded 
that t-hexylperoxy alkanoate is 2-methylpentyl-2-peroxy alkanoate. 
These patent publications also disclose the use of 
2-methylpentyl-2-peroxyalkanoates in the polymerization of vinyl 
monomers. Exemplified is 2-methylpentyl-2-peroxy neodecanoate (THPND). There are several drawbacks to using the disclosed radical 
polymerization initiators in the (co)polymerization of vinyl monomers. 
The polymerization activity of TBPP is insufficient and the polymer 
conversion is relatively low, though the properties of the obtained  
 
polymer are satisfactory. It has also been found that the use of THPND 
results in a low polymer conversion. In addition, CND imparts a 
peculiar, offensive smell to the polymer due to the presence of 
decomposition products. Furthermore, the synthetic resin industry demands reduction of the 
polymerization time. Although it was attempted to attain this 
requirement by increasing the amount of initiator, this method 
appeared to be impracticable, the resulting polymers being coloured. An object of the present invention is to provide a polymerization 
process having high polymerization velocity, a short polymerization 
time, and an increase in conversion. Another object of the present 
invention is to provide a polymerization process for producing a 
colourless polymer having no offensive smell. Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for
