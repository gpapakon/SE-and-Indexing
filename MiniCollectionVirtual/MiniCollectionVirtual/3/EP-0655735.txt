<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a reproducing apparatus arranged 
to reproduce 
an information signal from a recording medium on 
which a number of recording tracks are formed in parallel 

with each other and the information signal is recorded on the 
recording tracks together with track number information 

indicative of numbers of the respective tracks, a pilot 
signal component being multiplexed onto the information 

signal periodically at intervals of a predetermined number of 
tracks. When the information signal is to be reproduced from 

the recording medium, the reproducing apparatus executes 
tracking control of the reproducing head with respect to a 

target track, by using the pilot signal component contained 
in a signal reproduced by a reproducing head. The 

reproducing apparatus determines the target track according 
to the track number information separated from the signal 

reproduced by the reproducing head. According to the above-described 
arrangement, it is possible to execute correct 

tracking control quickly after the start of reproduction. In 
addition, since the track number information recorded on the 

recording medium in a multiplexed manner is effectively 
utilized, it is not necessary to provide a special circuit 

for determining the target track.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
reproducing a signal from a number of tracks formed on a
recording medium and, more particularly, to tracking control
for use in the apparatusTwo types of reproduction tracking systems for
domestic-use video tape recorders (VTRs) have heretofore been
proposed and put into practice. One type of reproduction
tracking system is a dedicated control track system (CTL
system) which is arranged to record a vertical synchronizing
signal separated from a recorded signal on a tape in the
longitudinal direction thereof by means of a fixed, magnetic
head which is provided at a location on a tape path. The
other type of reproduction tracking system is a system (4fATF
system) in which four kinds of pilot signals having
different, comparatively low frequencies are cyclically
recorded in a multiplexed manner on a track on which a main
signal is recorded. In such a 4fATF system, during
reproduction, crosstalk components reproduced from both
tracks adjacent to a track from which a main signal is
reproduced are compared with each other to obtain a tracking
error signal (ATF error signal).However, the CTL system is disadvantageous to a
reduction in the size of the entire assembly since a space
for the fixed head is needed. In contrast, the 4fATF system 
is advantageous to a reduction in the size of the entire
assembly, but the four kinds of pilot signals are needed.In recent years, the digitization of domestic-use
VTRs has proceeded and the image quality thereof has
increasingly been improved. In such a situation, VTRs which
are arranged to record an image signal for one field on a
plurality of tracks in divided form have been developed so
that a comparatively large amount of information can be
recorded or reproduced, and tracking systems for use in such
VTRs have been considered.One example of such a tracking system will be
described below in brief.As is known, general VTRs are arranged to form a
number of helical tracks and record a video signal on each of
the helical tracks. In this tracking system, pilot signals
are multiplexed on the video signal every other track. More
specifically, two kinds of pilot signals f1 and f2 having
different frequencies are alternately recorded in units of
one track; that is to say, each of the pilot signals f1 and
f2 is multiplexed periodically at intervals of four tracks.During reproduction, when a reproducing head
reproduces a main signal from a track on which no pilot
signal is multiplexed, crosstalk components of the pilot
signals f1
