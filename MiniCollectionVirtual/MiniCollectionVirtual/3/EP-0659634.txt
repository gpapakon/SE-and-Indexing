<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a suspension device for a tracked vehicle (10) which has a vehicle frame (12) and also a drive wheel (16), which is mounted in an axle housing (26) of the vehicle frame (12), an idler (18) and a continuous track (20) which loops around the drive wheel (16) and the idler (18). The axle housing (26) bears a first axle part (24) in a manner which allows it to pivot, which axle part extends from the drive wheel (16) essentially in the direction of the idler (18) and can be connected to the vehicle frame (12). Provision is further made for a second axle part (30) which bears the idler (18) in the manner which alows it to rotate, which axle part extends essentially from the idler (18) in the direction of the drive wheel (16) and is connected to the first axle part (24) in an articulated manner via an axle-part pivot (32). The second axle part (30) has a track roller cantilever (42) to which is coupled, via a track roller frame pivot (46), a pivotable track roller frame (44) which, for its part, bears a plurality of track rollers (47) which are in engagement with the continuous track (20). The proposal is furthermore for an arrangement for adjusting the track width of a tracked vehicle (10) which has a frame, with a drive wheel (16), an idler (18) and a suspension device which has track rollers (47) and a continuous track (20). The continuous track (20) loops around the drive wheel (16), the idler (18) and the track rollers (47). A first tube (50) has a cylindrical frame opening which is directed transversely with respect to the vehicle frame (12), and a second tube (52) has a transversely directed, cylindrical suspension opening. The second tube (52) is fastened in such a manner to the first tube (50) that their openings (50, 52) are directed parallel and offset with respect to each other. The first tube (50) holds an outwardly pointing frame stub axle (58) and the second tube (52) holds an inwardly pointing suspension stub axle (60), in order to connect the suspension system to the vehicle frame (12).

Suspension device for a tracked vehicle (10), the 
tracked vehicle having a frame (12), with a drive 

wheel (16), mounted in an axle housing (26) of the 
vehicle frame (12), an idler (18) and a track (20) 

extending around the drive wheel (16) and the 
idler (18), in which device a first axle member 

(24) is borne pivotally by the axle housing (26), 
extends from the drive wheel (16) essentially in 

the direction of the idler (18) and can be 
connected to the vehicle frame (12),
 
characterised in that
 
a second axle member (30) is provided which 

carries the idler (18) rotatably, extends 
essentially from the idler (18) in the direction 

of the drive wheel (16) and is joined to the 
first axle member (24) via an axle member 

pivot (32), and in that the second axle 
member (30) has a track roller extension (42), to 

which a track roller frame (44) is attached 
pivotally via a track roller frame pivot (46), 

said frame in turn carrying a plurality of track 
rollers (47) which engage with the track (20).  

 
Suspension device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the first axle member (24) can be connected to 

the vehicle frame (12) via a pendulum assembly 
(48) which is pivotally attached to the vehicle 

frame (12) and the first axle member (24), 
forming a vertical centre line. 
Suspension device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the second axle member (30) is designed to be 

telescopic for tensioning the track. 
Suspension device according to one of claims 1 to 
3,
 
characterised in that
 
the track roller extension (42) extends from the 

axle member pivot (32) essentially at an angle 
backwards and downwards. 
Suspension device according to one of claims 2 to 
4,
 
characterised in that
  
 

the axle member pivot (32) defines an axle 
member pivot vertical plane, that the track roller 

frame pivot (46) defines a frame pivot vertical 
plane and in that the vertical centre line of the 

pendulum assembly (48) lies between the axle 
member pivot plane and the frame pivot plane. 
Suspension device according to one of claims 1 to 
5,
 
characterised in that
 
the second axle member (30) has a stop extension 

(74) which, upon a downward movement of the idler 
(18), limits the pivoting angle of the second 

axle member (30) relative to the first axle 
member (24). 
Suspension device according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the first axle member (24) has a horizontal 

flange (66) which engages with the stop 
extension (74) to limit any downward movement of 

the idler (18). 
Suspension device according to claim 7,
  
 

characterised in that
 
the horizontal flange (66) contains a stop 

extension (65) which, upon an upward movement of 
the idler (18), limits the pivoting angle of the 

second axle member (30) relative to the first 
axle member (24). 
Suspension device according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that the second axle member (30) 

engages with the horizontal flange (66) to limit 
any upward movement of the idler (18). 
Assembly for adjusting the track width of a 
tracked vehicle (10) which has a frame, said 

assembly comprising a drive wheel (16), an idler 
(18) and a suspension device, which can be 

designed in accordance with claims 1 to 9, and 
track rollers (47) and a track (20) extending 

around the drive wheel (16), the idler (18) and 
the track rollers (47), this assembly being 

characterised by a first tube (50) which has a 
cylindrical frame aperture aligned transverse to 

the vehicle frame (12) and a second tube (52) 
which has a cylindrical transverse suspension  

 
system aperture, the second tube (52) being 

fastened to the first tube (50) in such a way that 
their apertures (50, 52) are aligned parallel to 

and offset from one another, and the first tube 
(50) receiving an outwardly projecting frame stub 

shaft (58) and the second tube (52) receiving an 
inwardly projecting suspension system stub shaft 

(60), in order to connect the suspension system to 
the vehicle frame (12).
