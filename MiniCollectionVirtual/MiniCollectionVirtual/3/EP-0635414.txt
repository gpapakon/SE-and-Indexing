<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an overhead conveyor system which ensures increased versatility of use, above all permits a high degree of variability with respect to the drives for the transport chain, and in order in particular to fulfil extremely varied technical requirements made of the system in a particular case, such as e.g. different deactivation times of the individual transport chain lengths, buffer zones or the like, a rail-bound, mobile drive means is provided as direct drive for a transport chain. Preferably, the drive means can be guided in a separate rail system, as a result of which each of the rails can be dimensioned according to the specific requirements with optimised use of materials. A drag chain of a power and free system may be provided as a direct drive for the transport chain.

<CLAIMS>
An overhead conveyor system, in particular for elongate
objects arranged spaced at relatively small distances

from one another, such as spools, bottles or the like,
the objects being retained and moved by at least one

endless transport chain (2) which is guided in a rail
system and each transport chain (2) being operatively

associated with at least one drive (4) guided in a
separate rail system (6), characterised in that the rail

system (6) for the drive is configured to differ with
respect to its profile and/or its path from the rail

system (7) of the transport chain (2).
An overhead conveyor system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that an electrically driven truck (9) is

provided as a direct drive (4) for the transport chain
(2), the electrically driven truck driving the transport

chain (2) in the manner of a locomotive.
An overhead conveyor system as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the electrically driven truck (9)

is associated with a coupling chain (10) for connecting
with at least one transport chain.
An overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 3, characterised
in that the coupling chain (10) consists of a link chain,

specifically a cardan link chain.
An overhead conveyor system as claimed in claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that the coupling chain (10) comprises

at least one coupling element (15) for connecting with
the electrically driven truck (9) and/or the transport

chain (2). 
An overhead conveyor system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that a drag chain (8) of a power and

free system is provided as a direct drive (4) for the
transport chain (2).
