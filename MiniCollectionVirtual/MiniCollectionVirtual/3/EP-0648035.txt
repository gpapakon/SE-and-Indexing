<ABSTRACT>
An accurate reception determining can be performed 
independent of a traffic characteristic value reported 

by a user. Traffic data are collected for respective 
set conditions (step 1016, 1022), and stored (step 

1024). When a call connection request is made (step 
1002) and if the traffic characteristic value is stored 

(step 1004), then, reception determining is performed by 
use of the traffic characteristic value thus stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for call admission control in an ATM 
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network. In an ATM network, since various types of data, 
including voice, image, and data communication data, 
which have various transmission rates and traffic 
characteristics are statistically multiplexed, call 
admission control is more complicated than in an STM 
(Synchronous Transfer Mode) network. The ATM network, 
when a call request is made, is required to determine 
whether or not the quality of service would be suitable 
in all connections including connections which are 
already established when the call request is accepted, 
and to determine propriety of the acceptance according to 
the available services. In order to make the 
aforementioned determination, it is recommended that each 
terminal issuing a call request should declare parameters 
such as an average rate (an average bandwidth) and a peak 
rate (a peak bandwidth) as source traffic 
characteristics, and that the call admission control is 
performed using the declared parameters (CCITT 
recommendation I. 311). However, it is not easy for a user to exactly 
determine his own traffic characteristics, and therefore, 
if incorrect parameters were declared, incorrect decision 
would be made. For example, in a situation where a call 
request should be rightfully rejected, if the call 
request was accepted because of incorrect declaration of 
too small a value, required quality of services would not 
be available even in connections which is already 
established. Even though exact perception would be possible, a  
 
range, within which users can perceive it, is limited as 
far as terminals, and if a subscriber network lies 
between the terminal and an ATM exchange, the traffic 
characteristics such as a peak bandwidth is varied by the 
subscriber network. If is an object of the present invention to provide 
an apparatus and a method for a call admission control 
wherein a correct decision for call admission is 
possible, not relying upon declared parameters of traffic 
characteristics such as an average bandwidth and a peak 
bandwidth. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a call admission control method for deciding 
admission of a call request requesting establishment of a 
connection in an ATM network, comprising the steps of:
 
   observing traffic characteristics with respect 
to every connection which is already established;
 
   storing observed values of the traffic 
characteristics
