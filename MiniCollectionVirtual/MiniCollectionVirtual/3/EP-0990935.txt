<ABSTRACT>
A lens for copying includes a lens for copying
disposed symmetrically about a stop. The lens for

copying includes, in succession from the object side, a
positive first lens (1) having convex lens surfaces, a

negative second lens (2) having concave lens surfaces, a
stop (SP), a third lens (3) of the same shape as the second

lens, and a fourth lens (4) of the same shape as the first
lens. When the focal length of the entire system is

defined as F and the focal length of the first lens is
defined as f1 and the radius of curvature of the i-th

lens surface is defined as ri and the thickness or air
space of the i-th lens is defined as di and the

refractive index of the material of the i-th lens is
defined as ni, the lens for copying satisfies

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lens for copying and an image copying apparatus using the same, and is suitable for an analog copying apparatus comprising a symmetrical type lens of a four-unit four-lens construction centering around a stop having F number 9.5 and a maximum half angle of view of the order of 23° and high optical performance over an entire image field which is suitable when for example, copying is effected with image information on the surface of an original imaged on the surface of a photosensitive member.There has heretofore been proposed an apparatus designed to copy image information on the surface of an original with the image information imaged on the surface of a photosensitive member at a predetermined magnification by a lens for copying. The lens for copying used in such an apparatus is required to have a wide angle of view and be compact in the entire lens system and moreover have predetermined optical performance.Various symmetrical type lenses for copying of a four-unit four-lens construction centering around a stop adopted for such a purpose are proposed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 60-51091 and 5-56485, etc.The lens system for copying disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 60-51091 comprises a lens system of a four-lens construction symmetrically disposed around a stop, and a positive first lens having convex lens surfaces, a negative second lens having concave lens surfaces, a stop, a third lens of the same shape as the second lens, and a fourth lens of the same shape as the first lens are disposed in succession from the object side.The lens for copying disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-56485 comprises a four-unit four-lens construction disposed symmetrically with respect to a stop disposed at the center of the lens system, and the lens components thereof as viewed from the object side are such that a first lens is comprised of a positive lens having convex lens surfaces, a second lens is comprised of a negative lens having concave lens surfaces, a third lens is comprised of a negative lens of the same shape as the second lens, and a fourth lens is comprised of a positive lens of the same shape as the first lens.These lenses for copying, however, have been insufficient from the viewpoint of widening the angle of view.It is the object of the present invention to appropriately set the lens construction of a lens for copying of a four-unit four-lens construction disposed symmetrically about a stop to thereby provide a lens for copying which
