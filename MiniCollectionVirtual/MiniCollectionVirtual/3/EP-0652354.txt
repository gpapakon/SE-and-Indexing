<ABSTRACT>
In a timing variator (10) between the crankshaft 
and the camshaft (21) of an internal combustion engine, 

whereby the timing can be changed by changing the angular 
position of a body (11) of the timing variator (10) 

connected to the crankshaft relative to a hub (12) of the 
timing variator (10) connected to the camshaft (21), using 

the movement of a piston (13) interposed between the body 
(11) and the hub (12) and coupled thereto by means of 

toothed coupling arrangements (22,23), there is provided for 
the purpose of reducing the timing variator (10) noise a 

torsion member (28) which produces a torque between the body 
(11) and the hub (12) and/or a braking device (33) between 

the body (11) and the hub (12) to brake their mutual 
movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a timing variator
between the crankshaft and the camshaft of an internal
combustion engine.As is well known, the timing variator of an
internal combustion engine is a mechanism which enables the
timing system setting to be changed to optimize the enaine
performance at varying loads and rpm.A timing variator commonly employed is a
hydromechanical type having a first element connected
drivingly to the engine crankshaft, a second element
connected drivingly to the timing system camshaft, and a
piston member mounted between and coupled to said elements.
In particular, the piston member is coupled to one of the
two elements by means of helical toothings and to the other
element either by spur toothings, or again helical
toothings. The piston member is moved relative to said
elements by a working fluid which is regulated by a valve
under control by an electronic control unit for the engine.
The movement of the piston member produces, through the
toothed coupling arrangement, a relative angular
displacement of said two elements, thereby changing the
timing angle relationship of the camshaft to the crankshaft,
and hence the enaine valve timing.Timing variators having the above outlined
features are known from EP-A-0486068 and JP-A-5240010.However, timing variators of the type outlined
above may present a problem of substantial importance.In conjunction with the classic timing system
including valves and valve springs, due to continued
reversal of the reaction load on the camshaft, as produced
by the timing system dynamic mode during the variator
operation, rattling noise is generated by a continued mutual
reciprocation of the enmeshed teeth as the load direction is 
reversed which is due to their backlash. This makes for
noisy operation of the timing variator and the enaine to
which it is incorporated. In addition, the toothing rate of
wear is increased.To avoid this problem, a perfect fit would have to
be provided between the teeth of the coupling arrangements,
but this is quite difficult to accomplish in the manufacturing
process, and hence impractical.Solutions to the problem have actually been
proposed. One solution provides a split piston member in two
parts to effectively offset consecutive helical toothing
sections on the two parts by application to such parts of an
appropriate elastic load to take up the backlash between the
teeth. Another solution provides for the fast reciprocating
movements of the toothinas to be damped by a viscous fluid.
Such solutions involve,
