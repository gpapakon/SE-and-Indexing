<ABSTRACT>
A method for correcting the skew between the 
leading edge of a sheet (32A) of paper and the nip 

(75) of a roller assembly (70) in a printing 
mechanism (10) includes the steps of advancing a 

sheet (32A) of paper into the nip (75) and slightly 
therebeyond. The rollers (72 
&
 74) are then rotated 
in reverse, causing the paper to retract from the 

roller assembly (70), with the angle and weight of 
the paper maintaining the leading edge within the nip 

(75). As the rollers (72 
&
 74) continue to rotate 
backwards, the paper jiggles or dances allowing the 

leading edge to settle parallel with the nip (75) 
under its own weight. The paper is then readvanced 

through the roller assembly (70) with its leading 
edge parallel to the nip (75). A mechanism (150, 

152, 162, 164, 172, 174, 182, 184, 185) applies a 
drag force to the paper when the paper is being 

retracted from the roller assembly (70) to keep the 
leading edge of the paper in the nip (75). 
A single motor control apparatus includes a 
processor-controlled drive motor (55), a drive roller 

assembly (70), a pick roller assembly (60) and a 
gearing arrangement (40) coupling the drive motor 

(55) to the roller assemblies (60, 70), for selective 
control of the timing, speed and rotational direction 

thereof to achieve the above described method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to printers, and 
more particularly to a method and apparatus for 
active skew correction and control of paper in a 
cut-sheet printer mechanism. In automatic cut-sheet printers, a stack of 
paper, cut to uniformly sized sheets, is 
automatically fed to a printer, typically using a 
roller assembly or other mechanisms. An important 
function of the printer feed mechanism is to control 
the parallelism between the top edge of the sheet of 
paper and the first line of print contained thereon, 
i.e., the amount of skew between the paper and the 
print. Even a small amount of skew between the paper 
and the print will cause the printing to appear 
crooked. Larger amounts of skew may cause buckling 
of the paper, resulting in uneven print quality or 
jamming of the paper within the printer. The skew is 
generally induced when the paper is loaded into 
and/or picked from a stack of paper in a supply  
 
tray. Accordingly, it is desirable to minimize the 
amount of skew between the paper and the printing 
assembly once the paper has been picked and before it 
is printed on. Prior art printing devices use a variety of 
techniques and apparatus to minimize skew. Some 
printers minimize skew by forcing a sheet of paper 
into a pair of stalled rollers, creating a buckle in 
the paper and forcing the leading edge of the paper 
to be parallel with the roller pair. The rollers are 
then activated to advance the paper into the print 
zone. Such a technique requires some type of 
clutching mechanism to stall the rollers long enough 
to allow the paper to be fed into the nip between the 
rollers. Further, this technique requires accurate 
control of the paper while it is buckling, as the 
buckle must be large enough to correct the skew, yet 
small enough that the paper does not flip out of the 
nip between the stalled rollers. Other prior art 
printers use tapered rollers which direct the sheet 
of paper against a reference wall, forcing it into 
alignment therewith and eliminating any skew before 
printing. This technique requires a large, flat 
surface in the area of the roller assembly and is 
relatively slow. Still other printers have no skew 
correction mechanism at all, relying entirely on the 
accurate feeding of paper into the roller assembly. In addition to minimizing skew, the feed 
mechanism of a printer must maintain accurate control 
of each sheet, from the time it is picked from the 
stack until it is ejected from the printer. The 
paper feed mechanisms of typical prior art

A method for controlling the skew between 
the leading edge of a sheet (32A) of paper and the 

print contained thereon in a printer mechanism (10) 
having a roller assembly (70) with at least two 

rollers (72 
&
 74) forming a nip (75) therebetween, 
the nip (75) being parallel with the print, said 

method comprising the steps of: 
   advancing a sheet (32A) of paper into the 

roller assembly (70) so that the leading edge is 
disposed beyond the nip (75); 

   retracting the sheet (32A) of paper from the 
roller assembly (70) with the leading edge retained 

in the nip (75); 
   during said retracting step, applying a drag 

force to the sheet (32A) of paper; 
   continuing retracting the sheet (32A) of 

paper from the roller assembly (70) so that the 
frictional engagement of the leading edge by the 

roller assembly (70) is overcome by the gravitational 
and drag forces on the paper, allowing the leading 

edge to settle within the nip (75) and parallel 
thereto; and 

   readvancing the sheet (32A) of paper into 
the roller assembly (70) with the leading edge 

parallel to the nip (70) as the paper is advanced 
through the nip (75). 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of 
retracting the sheet (32A) of paper comprises the 

steps of 
   actuating the roller assembly (70) so that 

roller assembly (70) urges the sheet (32A) of paper 
in a rearward direction, causing the leading edge to 

disengage from the roller assembly (30); and
 

   supporting the sheet (32A) of paper at an 
acute angle with respect to a horizontal surface.
