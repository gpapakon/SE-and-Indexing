<ABSTRACT>
An air intake system has two resonance chambers (3, 4) coupled to one another by means of connecting pipes (5, 6), which chambers are connected by individual intake pipes (10, 11) to the cylinders. A vessel (20) is coupled by means of resonance pipes (12-17) to the resonance chambers. A connecting pipe and several of the resonance pipes have controllable shut-off elements (30-33). A branch feeding air to the system is connected to one of the connecting pipes and to the vessel. For purposely increasing the mean pressure, the shut-off elements can be opened like a cascade as the engine speed increases, thereby increasing the volume connected at any one time.

An air-intake system of a multiple-cylinder, two-row internal-combustion engine, in 
which the cylinders (7, 8) of one row are each connected by induction pipes (10, 11) to a 

resonance container associated with the said row, and with at least one connecting pipe 
(5, 6) which extends between the resonance containers (3, 4) and into which fresh air 

flows and which comprises at least one controllable shut-off member, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one resonance tube (12 to 17) is associated with each cylinder (7, 8), 
wherein the said resonance tubes (12 to 17) are arranged extending from the resonance 

container (3, 4) of one cylinder row (1, 2) to a container (20) common to the resonance 
tubes and provided with a fresh-air inlet (24), and wherein a controllable shut-off 

member (32, 33) is arranged in at least one of the resonance tubes associated with a 
cylinder row (7, 8). 
A system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a controllable shut-off member 
(32, 33) is arranged in at least two resonance tubes (12, 14 and 15, 17 respectively) of 

each cylinder row (1 and 2 respectively). 
A system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a second connecting pipe (6) comprising 
at least one controllable shut-off member (31) is arranged extending parallel to 

the first connecting tube (5) and between the resonance containers (3, 4). 
A system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the resonance containers (3, 4) are 
arranged spaced and parallel on both sides of a plane of symmetry (
E-E
), and the container

 the shut-off members (32 
and 33 respectively) are arranged in the portions (18 and 19 respectively) of the resonance 

tubes (12, 15 and 14, 17 respectively) situated inside the resonance containers (3, 4).  
 
A system according to Claim 1 or 7, 
characterized in that
 at least two resonance tubes

A system according to Claim 6 or 8, 
characterized in that
 at least two of the portions 
(18, 19) of the resonance tubes (12, 13, 14 and 15, 16, 17 respectively) extending inside
