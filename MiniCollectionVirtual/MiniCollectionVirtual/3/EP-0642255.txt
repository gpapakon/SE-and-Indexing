<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus is disclosed which 
utilizes a distinctive ringing pattern service provided 

by a switching network for switching speech 
communication to and from data communication and for 

telling who is to answer an incoming call. In the 
communication apparatus: switch means switches speech 

communication to and from data communication; control 
means controls the switching means according to an 

intermittent pattern of a call signal from a switching 
network; the control means includes voice answering 

means and controls the voice answering means according 
to an intermittent pattern of a call signal; the 

control means also includes data communication means 
including facsimile data communication, and controls 

the data communication means so as to transmit data 
corresponding to an intermittent pattern of a call 

signal; record means records data from a calling party 
side; and display means displays character information 

corresponding to an intermittent pattern of a call 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
apparatus which operates according to an intermittent
pattern of a call signal from a switching network.In the case of sharing one communication line
between speech communication and data communication,
after the line is connected with a communication
partner, when a data communication signal is
transmitted from the communication partner, a data
communication is performed; and when a speech voice is
transmitted, a bell sound is rung to call an operator
for carrying out a speech communication.However, even when the communication partner wants
a speech communication, if an operator is absent, a
communication charge is imposed on the partner although
the speech communication fails.In some case, a data communication signal or a
speech voice is not properly detected.Also, in some case, when a plurality of users
share one communication apparatus, it is unknown which
user is to answer an incoming call.There is an apparatus which allows a confidential 
reception of data which is not wanted to be disclosed to others.However, the confidential reception does not work unless a
transmission side and a reception side agree about communication procedure.U.S. patent no. 5,200,992 discloses a communication apparatus
connected to a PBX extension line which identifies the type of a calling party
side on receipt of an incoming call, i.e. discriminates between an intercom call
and an outside call. This communication apparatus previously stores an On
time and an OFF time of a call signal from an extension line and a call signal
from an outside line for comparison with an input call signal.However, as the types of call signals increase, it is necessary for the
communication apparatus to previously store an ON time and an OFF time for
each of the types of call signals; hence, a memory for such storage is needed,
and processing are complicated.Document EP 0 454 452 discloses a data communication apparatus
which has function of selectively switching data communication and speech
communication automatically.In this document, when an original document is at the transmission
part at the time of response to incoming call, communication in polling mode is
executed. In the contrary case, when CNG signal is detected after response to
incoming call, facsimile communication is executed and when CNG is not
detected, speech communication is executed.It is an object of the present invention to improve a communication
apparatus. To meet this object the present invention provides a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A communication apparatus having discriminating means for
discriminating whether or not a calling party is a data communication terminal,

in accordance with a signal from the calling party,

   said apparatus being capable of executing a first mode to start the
data communication in response to an automatic response to an incoming call and

a second mode to start selectively the data communication process or
a telephone process in accordance with the result of discrimination by said

discriminating means after the detection of a ringing signal, 
characterized in
that
 it comprises:

ringing signal distinguishing means for detecting plural kinds of
ringing signals from a communication line to which a plurality of identification

information are assigned, and for distinguishing the kind of the detected ringing
signal; and
selecting means for selectively executing one of the first mode and
the second mode in accordance with the kind of ringing signal distinguished by

said ringing signal distinguishing means.
A communication apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising voice answering means (16) for sending a voice message to the

communication line, and

   wherein said selecting means selects one of the first mode, the
second mode and a third mode to send the voice message in accordance with

the kind of ringing signal distinguished by said ringing signal distinguishing
means.
A communication apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
data communication includes facsimile data communication. 
A communication apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
discriminating means discriminates in accordance with a CNG signal from the

calling party.
