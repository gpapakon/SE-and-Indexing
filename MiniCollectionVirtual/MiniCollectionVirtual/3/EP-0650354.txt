<ABSTRACT>
Active substances, such as drugs, which are not readily soluble in water, are converted to the dissolved (molecular-dispersed) state by dissolving them in a hydrophilic peptide with a molecular weight of more than 100 Daltons, such as a gelatin. This ensures the solubility of the drugs both during storage and when the preparation is used by the end-user or patient, without the need for organic solvents or for solubilizers with undesirable side-effects.
