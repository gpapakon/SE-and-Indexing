<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a NOx adsorption and removal 
apparatus employed in the method of passing NOx containing 

gas into the adsorber 1 filled with NOx adsorbent to adsorb 
a specific volume of NOx on the adsorbent, passing hot air 

into the adsorber to desorb NOx, and regenerating the 
adsorbent, wherein the adsorber is divided in plural zones 

arranged parallel in the gas flow direction. 
In this invention, by regenerating after adsorbing NOx 
in each zone, the regenerating apparatus can be reduced in 

size, and the energy may be saved by effective utilization 
of preheat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adsorption and
removal method for efficiently removing nitrogen oxides
(NOx) of low concentration contained in ventilation gas in
various tunnels including various road tunnels, mountain
tunnels, submarine tunnels, underground tunnels, and road
with shelter.In various road tunnels, mountain tunnels, underground
tunnels, roads with shelter and the like (these are
collectively called "road tunnels" in the specification),
particularly in those of long distance and heavy traffic
volume, ventilation of a considerable volume is necessary
for protection of health of passers and improvement of
distance of clear vision. Besides, in relatively short
tunnels, in the urban or suburban district, the tunnel air
must be aspirated and exhausted (ventilated) as means of
preventing air pollution by carbon monoxide (CO) or NOx,
etc. concentrated at the entrance and exit.However, if the ventilation gas is directly scattered
around, it is not regional environmental improvement, but
is a mere spread of automotive exhaust and expands the
highly polluted area in the urban or suburban district. As 
the pollution control means of existing roads, where
tunnels and shelters are installed, the situation is
exactly the same.The invention relates to the adsorption and removal
method for efficiently removing NOx of low concentration
contained in the ventilation gas of such road tunnels.As the characteristics of the ventilation gas of
various tunnels, the concentration of NOx contained therein
is low, about 10 ppm or less, the gas temperature is 100Â°C
or less, or usually ordinary temperature, and the gas
volume fluctuates significantly depending on the traffic
volume.The inventors proposed a purification apparatus of
ventilation gas of road tunnel for the purpose of
efficiently adsorbing and removing NOx of low
concentration, which is a rotary NOx adsorption and removal
apparatus mainly constituted with a honeycomb block NOx
adsorbent rotor composed of plate adsorbent bearing Ru or
Ce on TiO2, comprising a NOx adsorption zone, a preheating
zone for preheating the unregenerated adsorbent ahead of
the adsorption zone in the rotating direction, an adsorbent
regeneration zone ahead of the preheating zone in the
rotating direction, and a cooling zone for cooling the
regenerated adsorbent ahead of the regeneration zone in the 
rotating direction (see the Japanese Laid-open Patent No.
3-258324). This apparatus is capable operating the entire
system continuously, does not need frequent opening and
closing of
