<ABSTRACT>

the following general formula : 


 
wherein R and R
1
 each represent a monovalent hydrocarbon 
group, X represents a hydrogen atom or a triorganosilyl 

group, and n is an integer of 15 to 4,000 and containing 
cyclic polysiloxanes having molecular weights of 3,000 or 

less in an amount of 50 ppm or less. This straight-chain 
organopolysiloxane is novel in that the straight-chain 

organopolysiloxane contains the cyclic polysiloxanes having 
molecular weights of 3,000 or less only in an amount of 50 

ppm or less. Where the straight-chain organopolysiloxane 
is used as an electric/electronic material, a building 

material, and the like, a contact failure due to 
volatilization of low molecular weight components, soiling 

to surroundings due to bleeding, and the like can be 
avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a straight-chain 
organopolysiloxane that is useful as a silicone oil whose 
various applications are known and as a raw material of a 
rubberlike cured product and a process of producing the 
same. Since straight-chain organopolysiloxanes have low 
surface tensions and low refraction indexes and are 
excellent in electrical insulating properties, 
releasability, water repellency, anti-foaming properties, 
oil resistance, solvent resistance, lubricity, heat 
resistance, and the like, they are used in various 
applications in a wide variety of fields of industry. However, where a hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane or the 
like is subjected to ring opening polymerization by the 
conventionally known method, in addition to the intended 
straight-chain organopolysiloxane, cyclic siloxanes and 
low-molecular-weight straight-chain siloxanes are 
concomitantly produced and, in particular, the repeat unit 
of the produced cyclic siloxanes ranges from three to tens. 
Out of these, low-molecular-weight straight-chain siloxanes 
and cyclic siloxanes having low degrees of polymerization 
can be removed by heating the polymer under reduced 
pressure, but cyclic siloxanes having molecular weights of  
 
740 or more, and particularly 1,480 or more, (such 
molecular weights normally correspond to cyclic siloxane 
oligomers composed of 10 more siloxane units, particularly 
20 to more siloxane units, in the case of cyclic 
dimethylsiloxanes), are very difficult to be removed. 
Therefore, if the thus obtained straight-chain 
organopolysiloxane is used as an oil or as a raw material, 
for example, of a rubberlike cured product and a coating 
film by a known technique, the remaining cyclic siloxanes 
volatilize gradually from the oil, the rubberlike cured 
product, or the like or bleed on the surface of the 
rubberlike cured product, causing an electrical contact 
trouble in the electric field and surrounding soiling in 
the field of building materials. Generally, such a 
trouble or problem is caused by cyclic siloxanes having 
molecular weights of 3,000 or less (such molecular weights 
normally correspond to cyclic siloxane oligomers composed 
of 3 to 40 siloxane units, in the case of cyclic 
dimethylsiloxanes). Therefore, it is desired to develop a straight-chain 
organopolysiloxane substantially free from cyclic siloxanes 
having molecular weights of 3,000 or less as well as low-molecular-weight 
straight-chain siloxanes and cyclic 
siloxanes having low degrees of polymerization. As
