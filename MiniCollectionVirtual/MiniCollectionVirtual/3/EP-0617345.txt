<ABSTRACT>
An intermediate toner transfer component comprising a substrate and thereover a 
coating comprised of a volume grafted elastomer, which is a substantially uniform integral 

interpenetrating network of a hybrid composition of a fluoroelastomer and a 
polyorganosiloxane, said volume graft having been formed by dehydrofluorination of said 

fluoroelastomer by a nucleophilic dehydrofluorinating agent, followed by addition 
polymerization by the addition of an alkene or alkyne functionally terminated 

polyorganosiloxane and a polymerization initiator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an imaging apparatus and intermediate toner 
transfer components thereof. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an imaging 
apparatus and process wherein an electrostatic latent image is formed on an imaging member 
and developed with a toner, followed by transfer of the developed image to a coated 
intermediate transfer belt or component and subsequent transfer with very high transfer 
efficiency of the developed image from the intermediate transfer element to a permanent 
substrate. The formation and development of images on the surface of photoconductive 
materials by electrostatic means is well known. The electrophotographic imaging process, as 
taught in US-A-2,297,691, entails placing a uniform electrostatic charge on a photoconductive 
insulating layer, such as a photoconductor or photoreceptor, exposing the photoreceptor to a 
light and shadow image to dissipate the charge on the areas of the photoreceptor exposed to 
the light, and developing the resulting electrostatic latent image by depositing on the image a 
finely divided electroscopic material known as toner. The toner will normally be attracted to 
those areas of the photoreceptor which retain a charge, thereby forming a toner image 
corresponding to the electrostatic latent image. This developed image may then be transferred 
to a substrate such as paper. The transferred image may subsequently be permanently affixed 
to the substrate by heat, pressure, a combination of heat and pressure, or other suitable fixing 
means such as solvent or overcoating treatment. Imaging processes wherein a developed image is first transferred to an intermediate 
transfer means and subsequently transferred from the intermediate transfer means to a 
substrate are known. For example, US-A-3,862,848 discloses an electrostatic method for the 
reproduction of printed matter in which an electrostatic latent image is developed by the 
attraction of electroscopic marking particles thereto and is then transferred to a first receptor 
surface by the simultaneous application of contact and a directional electrostatic field of a 
polarity to urge the marking particles to the receptor surface, with the image then being 
transferred from the first receptor surface to a second receptor surface by the simultaneous 
application of contact and a directional electrostatic field of opposite polarity to urge the 
marking particles to the second receptor surface. Intermediate transfer elements employed in imaging
