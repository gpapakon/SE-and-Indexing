<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic materials
for EL (electroluminescent) devices and to EL devices,
and more particularly it relates to organic materials for
EL devices which exhibit electroluminescence upon the
application of a voltage, and to EL devices which employ
the above-mentioned organic materials.EL devices employing luminescent materials which
exhibit electroluminescence upon the application of a
voltage are conventionally used in backlights for
displays of OA machines such as word processors and for
automobile meters.Although inorganic compounds have conventionally
been used as the luminescent materials for such EL
devices, high driving voltages have been required when
inorganic compounds for EL devices are caused to emit
high-intensity light.Recently, therefore, research has been conducted in
regard to organic compounds for EL devices, which allow
lower driving voltages (see, for example, C.W. Tang and
S.A. VanSlyke: Appl. Phys. Lett. 51. 913 (1987)).Thin-film EL devices employing such organic
compounds are able to have lower driving voltages in
comparison with the conventional inorganic compounds for
EL devices.However, the light emitted by organic compounds for
EL devices capable of emitting light at sufficient
intensity is usually in the green band (492-577 nm).Consequently, EL devices employing organic
luminescent materials have had an inappropriate color for
use in backlights of OA machine displays, etc.On the other hand, EL devices require multiple
colors for their use in displays. Here, it is an object of the present invention to
provide an organic compound for EL devices which exhibits
luminescent colors different from conventional organic
compounds for EL devices and which is capable of
displaying sufficient intensity, and an EL device
employing it.As a result of study aimed at achieving the above-mentioned
object, the present inventors have found that
an EL device employing a 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline zinc
complex as the luminescent material produces yellow-green
to yellow luminescent colors at a high intensity upon the
application of a driving voltage, and thus the present
invention has been completed.In other words, the present invention provides an
organic material for EL devices comprising 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline
zinc complex represented by the
following formula (I), as well as an EL device employing
this organic material.
