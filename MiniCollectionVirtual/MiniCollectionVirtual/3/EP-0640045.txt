<ABSTRACT>
Deposit container useful for many kinds of purposes like as a roof box for a motor car, as a ski box, as a deposit container for boats, buses, caravans, motor-houses, snow sleighs etc., and which is composed by several small units (1-4) and is mountable and dismountable, and which mainly comprises four box parts, namely two identical or nearly identical lid box halves (1, 2) and two identical or nearly identical bottom box halves (3, 4) which halves can quickly and easily be interconnected to form a lid box and a bottom box respectively, and which has standard fittings (7) for hinges (8) and locks (9) and other means. The lid box halves (1, 2) and the bottom box halves (3, 4) are formed so that, in the dismounted condition of the deposit box, they can be partly introduced in each other and can be stored in such compacted condition in a simple storing package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a deposit container of the 
type which is nowadays commonly used as a motor car roof-box, a ski box, 
or as a container for any kinds of goods. There exist many various types and sizes of roof boxes of the said 
type. Most roof boxes are relatively long, often between 2 and 2.5 meters 
long, and they have generally been made as a bottom box part which can 
be clamped to a couple of roof racks, load racks or any other mounting 
means at the roof of a motor car, and which bottom box part has a 
rotatably connected lid box part, which is usually rotatably connected at 
the front edge or the rear edge of the bottom box part, but which may 
alternatively be rotatably connected at any of the long sides of the car roof 
box. A deposit container of the above mentioned type also is useful as a 
load container for boats, ski sleighs and for many other purposes. A problem in connection to roof boxes of the priorly known type is 
that said boxes are very bulky, and that the boxes often must be hoisted 
up to the garage ceiling by means of blocks and pulleys when the roof 
boxes are removed from the car or the bus, or from the boat etc. It is also 
possible to put the roof box down standing on its rear end and to strap the 
box e.g. to a wall so that the box does not tilt over and damages objects or 
persons standing in the vicinity the the roof box. Many car drivers have no 
garage and can often not have the roof box standing or hanging in his 
home, and in such cases it may be necessary to let the roof box remain on 
the motor car all the year. This leads to unnecessarily increased fuel 
consumption upon driving the car, there appear problems when the car is 
to be washed, wind noice, destruction of the lacquer etc. Upon sale in a store such roof boxes also occupy so large space that 
they are generally exposed in special storage stands with several boxes 
placed above each other. Such storage stands are large, bulky and 
expensive. The known roof boxes mostly are manufactured by a vacuum 
forming process of a suitable plastic material generally using large plastic 
plates. The toos for vacuum formation are large and are difficult to handle,  
 
and the plastic plate material from which the the roof box bottom and the 
roof box lid is press formed is expensive. The object of the invention therefore is to suggest a deposit 
container which can be used for many different purposes, for instance as a 
roof box for a motor car, as a ski box, as a deposit box for boats, buses,

<CLAIMS>
Deposit container useful for all kinds of purposes like as a roof 
box for a motor car, as a ski box, as a deposit container for boats, buses, 

caravans, motor houses, snow sleighs etc., and which is composed of 
several small units (1-4) and is mountable and dismountable, 
characterized
 
   in that the container is mainly composed of four box parts, namely 

two identical or nearly identical lid box halves (1, 2) and two identical or 
nearly identical bottom box halves (3, 4) having standard fittings (7) for 

hinges (8) and locks (9) and other means,
 
   in that each of said box parts (1-4) are formed with a flat joining 

edge (18),
 
   in that said joining edge (18) has means means (21, 22) for quick 

and simple joining of said parts, in pairs, to form an integral complete lid 
(1, 2) and an integral complete bottom (3, 4) respectively,
 
   in that the joining edge (18) for the lid box halves (1, 2) and the 

bottom box halves (3, 4) respectively, in the ready mounted deposit 
container, extends in a transversal and a vertical plane,
 
   and in that the lid box parts (1, 2) and the bottom box parts (3, 4) 

are so similar to shape and size that said parts, when the deposit container 
is dismounted, can be stacked into each other and can be stored in such 

compacted state. 
Deposit container according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
lid box halves (1, 2) and the bottom box halves (3, 4) resp. are identical, 

and in that the container is symmetrical about the transversal, vertical 
plane. 
Deposit container according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that each 
of the parts (1, 2) for the lid box and each of the parts (3, 4) for the 

bottom box, at the transversal joining edge (18) thereof, has an outwardly 
facing U-shaped groove (21) extending along half the width of the box part 

and a rib (22) corresponding to and fitting to said U-shaped groove (21) 
and extending along the other half of the width of the box part. 
Deposit container according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the 
meeting edges of the U-groove (21) and the rib (21) are bevelled so as to 

form a V-groove therebetween, whereby two like parts (1-2 and 3-4 resp.)  
 

can be joined by moving said parts together rotated about 90° in relation to 
each other and by thereafter rotating said parts back, so that the U-grooves 

(21) and the corresponding ribs (22) inter-engage. 
Deposit container according to any of claims 2-4, 
characterized
 in 
that the parts of the lid and the parts of the bottom respectively are self-locking

direction, and in that said parts are secured against mutual rotation by 

means of one or more simple locking pins (25) engaging bores (26) at the 
joining edges (18). 
Deposit container according to claim 1 and 2,
