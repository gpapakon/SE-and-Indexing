<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic resin composition prepared by blending (a) 0.1-99 wt.% of a fluoropolymer containing a 
hydroxyl or epoxy group at least at one terminal of the main and side chains thereof and having a number-average 

molecular weight of 2,000 to 1,000,000 and (b) 1-99.9 wt.% of a heat-resistant thermoplastic resin having a crystal

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic
resin composition which comprises a specific fluorine-containing
polymer having a functional group and a
thermoplastic resin having a crystalline melting point or
glass transition temperature of not less than 150°C, and
has improved mechanical and chemical properties.Heat resisting crystalline thermoplastic resins
(having a crystalline melting point of not less than
150°C) such as polyacetals, polyamides, aromatic
polyesters, polyarylene sulfides, polyketones, polyether
ketones, polyamide imides and polyether nitriles are
excellent in mechanical properties and moreover
moldability, and therefore are used for functional parts
for automobiles, industrial machineries, office automation
equipments, and electrical and electronic equipments.
Meanwhile there is a market demand for higher chemical
resistance, sliding properties and the like, and
particularly impact resistance is desired to be enhanced
because those resins are generally brittle. Also, heat
resisting amorphous thermoplastic resins (having a glass
transition temperature of not less than 150°C) such as
polycarbonates, polyphenylene ethers, polyalylates,
polysulphones, polyether sulphones, and polyetherimides
are widely used for making the best use of transparency,
dimensional stability, impact resistance, and the like,
but generally there are problems with chemical resistance,
solvent resistance and moldability.Fluorine-containing resins such as polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE), tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoroalkyl
vinyl ether copolymer (PFA), tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP), polyvinylidene 
fluoride (PVDF) and ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene
copolymer (ETFE) are excellent in thermal resistance,
chemical resistance, solvent resistance, weather
resistance, sliding properties, pliability, electrical
properties and the like, and are widely used for
automobiles, industrial machineries, office automation
equipments, electrical and electronic equipments, and the
like. However, there are many cases where those resins
are inferior in mechanical properties and physical thermal
resistance as represented by a deflection temperature
under load, as compared with heat resisting crystalline
thermoplastic resins, and the uses thereof are within the
limited range because the dimensional stability is
inferior as compared with heat resisting amorphous
thermoplastic resins.Attempts have been actively made to obtain novel
materials by combining a fluorine-containing polymer
(including resinous and
