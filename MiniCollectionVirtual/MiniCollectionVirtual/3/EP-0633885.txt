<DESCRIPTION>
 TRIAZ0L0QUIN0XALIN-1 ,4-DIONES AND THEIR PREPARATION AND USEThe present invention relates to therapeutically active heterocyclic com- pounds, a method of preparing the same, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and a method of treating therewith.L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid and a number of other closely related amino acids have in common the ability to activate neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacolo¬ gical studies have substantiated this and demonstrated that acidic amino acids are transmitters for the vast majority of excitatory neurons in the mammalian CNS.Interaction with glutamic acid mediated neurotransmission is considered a useful approach in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Thus, known antagonists of excitatory amino acids have shown potent anxiolytic (Stephens et al., Psychopharmacology 90, 143-147, 1985), anticonvulsant (Croucher et al., Science 216. 899-901 , 1982) and muscle relaxant properties (Turski et al., Neurosci. Lett. 53, 321-326,. 1985).It has been suggested that accumulation of extracellular excitatory amino acids, followed by overstimulation of neurons, may explain the neuronal degenerations seen in neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, epilep¬ sy, and deficiencies of mental and motor performance seen after conditions of brain ischemia, anoxia and hypoglycemia or head and spinal cord trauma (McGeer et al., Nature 263, 517-519, 1976; Simon et al., Science 

 226. 850-852, 1984; Wieloch, Science 230, 681-683, 1985; Faden et al., Science 244, 798-800, 1989; Turski et al., Nature 349, 414-418, 1991). αher possible indications are psychosis, muscle rigidity, emesis and analgesia.Excitatory amino acids exert their actions via specific receptors located postsyπaptically or presynaptically. Such receptors are at present con¬ veniently subdivided into three groups bases on electrophysiolpgical and neurochemical evidence: 1 the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, 2 the AMPA receptors, and 3 the kainate receptors. L- glutamic acid and L- aspartic acid probably activate all the above types of excitatory amino acid receptors and possibly other types as well.The above mentioned classification of excitatory amino acid receptors into NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors is based primarily on the following electrophysiological and neurochemical findings.1. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors exhibit high selectivity
