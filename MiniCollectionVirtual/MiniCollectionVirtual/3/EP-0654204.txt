<ABSTRACT>
In an adapter (1) with exchangeable contact elements (4), the support plate (2) is a plate made up of several layers (20, 21, 22) and the contact elements (4) set into bores (3) are removably held and axially locked into place in their bores (3) between two layers (20, 22) by a bead (51) formed on said elements, preferably also in a vacuum-tight manner.

An adapter for a test system (11) for circuit boards (100),
 
characterized by 


a support plate (2) and 
pin-shaped contact elements (4), that are axially adjusted and, due to the given 
fitting, inserted practically without lateral leeway in the corresponding bore (3) of 

the support plate (2); 
whereby this support plate (2) is a composite plate (20, 21, 22), characterized by a 
basis support plate (20) consisting of a hard plastic material, and on one side a first 

layer (21) and then a second layer (22), whereby a bore is drilled in the support 
plate (20) and axially aligned in at least the second layer (22), with the same 

diameter; 
whereby the contact element is equipped with a ring-shaped bead (51) on the outer 
circumference that is inserted into the bore (3); said bead locking the contact 

element (4) into place in the support plate (2), within the first layer (21), and the 
second layer (22) holding the contact element, whereby said second layer (22) 

exhibits an elastic effect in the vicinity of the bore (3) due to the material 
properties and / or the selected material thickness of this layer with respect to the 

bead (51) of the contact element (4); and the first layer (21), in comparison to the 
second layer (22), exhibits significantly higher resilience there. 
An adapter as in claim 1, wherein the maximum outer diameter of the bead and the 
elastic effect of the second layer (22) as well as the axial height of the bead (51) 

and the thickness of the first layer (21) are determined with reference to another 
and in reference to the diameter of the bore (3), such that the inserted contact 

element (4) is axially locked into place within specified tolerance. 
An adapter as in claims 1 or 2, whereby the bead (51) is, for the most part, shaped 
like a truncated cone, and is orientated such that the larger conical diameter is 

adjacent to the second layer (22) in the locked position. 
An adapter as in claims 1 or 2, whereby the bead (51) is shaped like a double cone 
(51') or in a shape with a circular cross-section (51"). 
An adapter as in claims 1 to 4, whereby, when the bead (51, 51', 51") is in the 
locked position, the surface of said bead adjacent to the second layer (22) is shaped  

 
such, that a vacuum seal exists between this part of the surface of the bead and the 

adjacent edge of the elastic material of the second layer (22). 
An adapter as in claims 1 to 5, characterized by an additional bead (151, 151') on 
the contact element (4) at some distance to the locked bead (51, 51', 51"), whereby 

this offset is, for the most part, equal to the thickness of the second layer (22). 
An adapter as in claims 1 to 6, whereby the first layer (21) is used as an adhesive 
layer between the basis support plate (20) and the second layer (22). 
An adapter as in claims 1 to 6, whereby the first layer (21) between the basis 
support plate (20) and the second layer (22) consists of air pockets, at least in the 

vicinity of the bores (3).
