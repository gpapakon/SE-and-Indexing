<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a piperidine derivative which is 
useful in the preparation of compounds having analgesic activity. A number of N-phenyl-N-(4-piperidinyl)amide derivatives have been described 
as analgesics and examples of such compounds are described in USP 3998834 
and USP 5019583. A subclass of these N-phenyl-N-(4-peridinyl)amide 
derivatives having analgesic activity are those containing the grouping 
 
and such compounds are conveniently prepared from the N-benzyl compound 
(I) 
 
USP 3998834 specifically teaches that the N-benzyl compound (I) may be 
prepared from the carboxylic acid (II) by the route outlined below.  
 
The carboxylic acid (II) is converted into the corresponding sodium salt (III) 
which is then reacted with methyl iodide to give the ester (IV). Reaction of the 
ester (IV) with propionic anhydride then yields the required N-benzyl compound 
(I) which is purified by column chromatography. The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing the N-benzyl 
compound (I) from the carboxylic acid (II) in a high yield. Furthermore the 
process has the advantage that relatively low reaction temperatures may be 
used, short reaction times, a simple isolation procedure and avoids the use of 
toxic reagents (methyl iodide or dimethyl sulphate) and thus is particularly 
convenient for the large scale manufacture of (I). Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of the 
N-benzyl compound of formula (I) which comprises reacting the carboxylic acid 
(II) or an acid addition salt thereof with propionic anhydride in the presence of a 
base and then without prior isolation treating the resultant product with 
methanol. The reaction of the compound of formula (II) with propionic anhydride is 
conveniently carried out in an aprotic solvent such as a hydrocarbon e.g. 
toluene or an ester e.g. ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate and in the presence of 
a base. Examples of suitable bases include tertiary amines such as 
trialkylamines e.g. triethylamine or heteroaryl amines e.g. pyridine. This 
reaction is also conveniently carried out at a temperature within the range 15-120° 
e.g. 15-80° and more particularly at ambient temperature or with heating 
e.g. 50-80°.  
 The subsequent reaction with methanol is preferably carried out with heating 
e.g. 50-80°. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the compound of formula (II) or an acid 
addition salt thereof is reacted with an excess of propionic anhydride in an 
aprotic
