<ABSTRACT>
A baffle-plate unit (11) comprises a baffle plate (13) and a carrier (18) for the baffle plate. The carrier (18) consists of two side parts (15) which are connected by means of a U-shaped yoke (17). The arms (19, 21) of the U-shaped yoke (17) are arranged transversely to the longitudinal axis of the baffle-plate unit (11), the arm (19) having on each side two mortise orifices (23), into which the tenons (27) of the side part (15) engage. Each side part (15) has a mortise orifice (29) into which engages a tenon (25) extending laterally outwards from the other arm (21) of the U-shaped yoke (17). The angled side wings (31) of the side parts (15) have at the lower end tenons which are inserted into corresponding mortise slots (35) of the baffle plate (13). The orifices (41,41') of the arms (19,21) serve for fastening the baffle-plate unit (11) in the burner.

Diaphragm unit for burner comprising a diaphragm (13), a
diaphragm support (18) with two lateral support members

(15) supporting the diaphragm (13), said support members
(15) being connected together by fastening means which

serve also for mounting the diaphragm unit in the burner,
characterised in that the fastening means is an U-like

bracket (17) having arms (19,21) arranged transverse to the
longitudinal axis of the diaphragm unit (11), in that an

arm (19) of the U-like bracket (17) has on each side at
least one plug-in opening (23) into which a lug (27) of the

lateral support member (15) is engaged, in that each
lateral support member (15) comprises at least one plug-in

opening (29) into which extends a lug (25) which extends
laterally outward from the other arm (21) of the U-like

bracket (17), and in that the diaphragm (13) is connected
with the lateral support members (15).
Diaphragm unit as in claim 1, characterised in that the
lateral support members (15) comprise lugs (33) capable of

being plugged into plug-in slots (35) of the diaphragm.
Diaphragm unit as in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
each lateral support member (15) comprises two spaced lugs

(27) which engage into corresponding plug-in openings (23)
at the arm (23).
Diaphragm unit as in one of the claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the arms (19,21) of the U-like
bracket (17) has in the longitudinal axis of the diaphragm

unit an opening (41,41') serving for mounting the diaphragm
unit (11) in the burner. 
Diaphragm unit as in one of the claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the lateral support members (15) have
at least one threaded hole (43) into which a screw for

fastening the diaphragm unit (11) in the burner can be
screwed.
Diaphragm unit as in one of the claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the lateral support members have
angular flaps (31).
