<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the filling of packaging containers 
(20), of cardboard or the like, with a viscous substance 

(34) such as soft ice-cream. The invention provides a 
method and an apparatus for the preferably continuous 

supply of a viscous substance, whereby a device in the form 
of a hot wire (39) is present for cutting the stream of 

substance at an appropriate position so as to allow each 
packaging container to be filled entirely whilst at the 

same time providing a high rate of production in the 
machine. The invention also provides a turntable (13) which 

is constructed in segments (X, Y, Z) so as to allow easy 
interchangeability of turntable units foreseen for 

different package dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of filling packages with 
a viscous substance such as soft ice cream and also to a 
device for use in the method. The invention also relates to 
an apparatus for supplying empty packaging containers to a 
filling station in accordance with the preamble of claim 8. In the field of packaging of viscous products, such as the 
packaging of ice cream into cardboard containers, the ice 
cream is supplied in a relatively viscous state into the 
package. The consistency can be compared to something like 
soft-ice cream, thus somewhere between melted and frozen. Due to this consistency, several problems arise when 
filling containers with the required contents. Firstly the 
ice cream should fill the package to as great an extent as 
possible, otherwise valuable packaging material is wasted 
in every pack. Secondly, the speed of filling must be high 
in order to be economical. A third problem is the starting 
and stopping of the flow of contents to the package whilst 
still having a device which is not too complicated. Thus, when the viscous ice cream is filled slowly and 
carefully into the packages, the packages can be filled 
accurately to about 100% of their intended volume. However, 
this requires a great deal of time or complicated variable 
filling speed mechanisms, due to the way the ice cream  
 
settles in the packages as a type of dome. Additionally, 
stopping the flow of ice cream at precisely the right time 
means that the process becomes slower due to the restarting 
of the flow after subsequent indexing of the 
container. If a high filling speed is used, the cartons 
cannot be accurately filled to occupy the available volume. 
Since the device should be economical and simple, one 
solution currently adopted is to accept some waste of 
packaging to maintain a relatively high speed and to have 
a continuous contents supply. Such a packaging device normally has the form of a rotating 
rose whereby packages will be fixed to a turntable and 
rotated through various filling and sealing stations, 
before being ejected. The various devices for opening, 
filling and sealing the packages are situated around the 
turntable at regular intervals, both above and below the 
turntable unit. A further problem arises in this regard 
concerning the manner in which the machine can be changed 
to cater for different sizes of packaging containers. The 
turntables are heavy and access is limited from above. Thus 
considerable down-time results whenever a machine run 
involving a new size

<CLAIMS>
Method of filling packaging containers with a 
relatively viscous substance (34), such as soft ice cream, 

said method comprising the steps of arranging an open 
packaging container (20) below an outlet (32) of a supply 

means (30, 31) for said substance such that an 
uninterrupted stream of said substance is present between 

the supply means outlet (32) and the packaging container 
opening, whereupon a mechanical separation means (39) is 

made to pass through and thus separate said stream at a 
height below said outlet (32). 
Method according to claim 1, wherein said supply means 
(30, 31) supplies said substance (34) continuously such 

that the supply is not stopped between filling said 
packaging container and a subsequent filling of a following 

container. 
Method according to either of claims 1 or 2, wherein 
said supply means outlet (32) is moved during filling, from 

a position inside said packaging container to a position 
outside and above said packaging container. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said mechanical separation means (39) is movable 

relative to means for supporting said packaging containers, 

and comprises a heated element, preferably an electrically 
heated wire. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein, when the packaging container is close to full, the 

supply means outlet (32) is moved upwardly at an 
 

accelerated rate in order to reduce the cross-sectional 
area of the stream of substance (34) being supplied to the 

container immediately prior to the mechanical means (38, 
39) separating the stream. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the supply means comprises a movable inner tubular 

part (30) and a movable outer tubular part (31), said parts 
being telescopically movably arranged with respect to each 

other, and wherein the outer part (31) is arranged to have 
a small clearance with respect to the inner sides of the 

packaging container (20) for movement with respect thereto. 
Method according to claim 6, wherein said outer part 
(31) is moved downwardly into the container so that its 

outlet (32) is at a small distance (37) from the base of 
said container in a first filling stage and is then 

gradually moved up inside the container and finally outside 
thereof in further filling stages. 
Apparatus for supplying empty packaging containers to 
a filling station, said apparatus comprising an 

intermittently rotating turntable (13), characterized in 
that said turntable (13) is composed of two or more 

removable segments (X, Y, Z) which can be fitted together 
and attached to a substantially central rotating support. 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that 
each of said segments (X, Y, Z) contains one or more 

movable holding means, preferably sprung locating fingers, 
to releasably hold one or more packaging containers in 

position on said segment. 
Apparatus according to either of claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that each of said movable holding means is 

provided with cam following means which are operated by a 
 

cam means in order to effect opening and closing of said 
holding means. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 8 to 10, 
characterized in that the turntable (14) is configured so 

as to have a series of equally angularly spaced areas, each 
of said areas comprising said movable holding means capable 

of releasably holding two packaging containers. 
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that 
the turntable (14) is positioned substantially centrally in 

a packaging machine, and in that said turntable is 
indexable between separate operating stations (1-12), each 

of which is spaced so as to align with each of said spaced 
segmental areas upon equal rotational indexing of said 

turntable. 
Device for separating or cutting through a continuous 
stream of viscous substance (34) in a packaging machine for 

carrying out the method of claim 1, characterized in that 
said device is a heated wire element (39) which is mounted 

(by means 38, 40) for substantially horizontal displacement 
with respect to a packaging container (20) to be filled.
