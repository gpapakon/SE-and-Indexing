<ABSTRACT>
A hollow profile moulding (1), which can be used as a spacer for insulating glass panes, comprises a cross-sectionally U-shaped metal part which forms the outer wall (2) of the hollow profile moulding (1) with its web (6) and forms the side walls (4) of the hollow profile moulding (1) with its inwardly folded-over legs (8, 10). The inner wall (3) of the hollow profile moulding (1) is formed by the web (15) of a cross-sectionally U-shaped plastic strip, of which the legs (17) are fixed on the side walls (4) by outwardly folded-over borders (18) in that they are clamped in the space between the legs (8) and the inwardly folded-over borders (10). The hollow profile moulding may be continuously produced by roll-forming from a metal strip and a plastic strip.
