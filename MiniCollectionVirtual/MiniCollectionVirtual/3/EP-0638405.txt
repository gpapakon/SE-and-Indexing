<ABSTRACT>
A method and an upholstery cover for fabricating an 
upholstered product which includes the steps of providing an 

upholstery cover (12) having a hollow interior space and at least 
one positioning member (34) having a portion thereof extending from 

the cover; positioning the cover adjacent to or against a foam 
molding fixture; securing the positioning member to the foam 

molding fixture to retain a portion of the cover in a 
predetermined location relative to the fixture; filling the 

hollow interior space of the cover with a liquid foaming agent; 
subsequently releasing the positioning member from the fixture; 

removing the filled cover from the fixture and finally, 
removing the extending portion of the positioning member from 

the cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
upholstery cover for fabricating upholstered articles and in 
particular to a method which utilizes a pour-in-place process 
to mold a foam pad within an upholstery cover. Many upholstered articles, such as seat cushions, seat 
backs and headrest pads for vehicle seat assemblies, are 
manufactured using a pour-in-place foam process. In such a 
process, an upholstery cover is first formed which defines a 
hollow interior space. This interior space is subsequently 
filled with a liquid foaming agent which cures to form a 
resilient foam pad that is at least partially covered by the 
upholstery cover. The pour-in-place process replaces a process 
in which a preformed and preshaped foam pad is mechanically 
attached or adhesively bonded to the cover member. While the pour-in-place process has several advantages 
over using a preshaped foam pad such as a reduction in 
manufacturing steps, the pour-in-place process does present 
some difficulties of its own. For example, the liquid foam 
does not always force the upholstery cover outward against a 
mold surface or otherwise force the cover to the desired final 
shape. Several methods have been developed for assisting in 
ensuring that the upholstery cover is in the proper position 
when filled with the foam. One method is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,987,666, assigned to the Assignee of the present 
invention. In the process disclosed in that patent, the seams  
 
of the cover are sewn with a stiff plastic welt to provide 
additional stiffness to the cover at the seams. This added 
stiffness helps to maintain the seams of the upholstery cover 
in the proper alignment. After the pour-in-place foaming 
operation, the external portion of the welt is removed. While 
the welts help to maintain proper alignment of the seams, there 
is limited interaction between the welts and the mold fixture 
to hold the welt against the mold surface. Incomplete filling 
of the upholstery cover can still result as there is no 
assurance that the welt will remain in contact with the surface 
of the foam molding fixture. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a method and apparatus for assuring that an upholstery 
cover is properly positioned with respect to a foam molding 
fixture. The method of fabricating an upholstered product according 
to the present invention includes the following steps. First, 
an upholstery cover is provided having a hollow interior space 
and at least one positioning member

<CLAIMS>
A method of fabricating an upholstered product 
comprising the steps of: 

   providing a cover made of a sheet upholstery material 
defining a hollow interior space and at least one positioning 

member separate from said sheet upholstery material having a 
portion thereof extending from said sheet upholstery material; 

   placing said cover on a foam molding fixture; 
   securing said at least one positioning member to said 

foam molding fixture to retain a portion of said cover in a 
predetermined location relative to said foam molding fixture; 

   filling said hollow interior space of said cover with 
a liquid foaming agent; 

   removing said filled cover and said positioning 
member from said foam molding fixture; and 

   removing said extending portion of said positioning 
member from said sheet upholstery material. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said removing step is 
performed by cutting said extending portion of said positioning 

member from said sheet upholstery material. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said removing step is 
performed by tearing said extending portion of said positioning 

member from said sheet upholstery material. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said cover is formed 
with a sewn seam in said upholstery material, said seam having 

opposite ends and said at least one positioning member includes 
a pair of strings extending from each end of said seam, said 

securing step including pulling of said strings in opposite 
directions away from said cover to apply a tensile force along 

said seam to pull said seam straight and subsequently attaching 
said strings to said foam molding fixture. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said cover is formed 
with a sewn seam in said upholstery material, and said at least 

one positioning member includes a tearable flexible sheet sewn 
into said seam and extending from said upholstery material 

forming a depending skirt, said securing step including 
attaching said skirt to said foam molding fixture. 
A cover for an upholstered article comprising: 
   multiple pieces of a sheet upholstery mater
ial sewn 
together with one or more seams, said upholstery material 

having an interior surface and an exterior surface and being 
sewn together to define a hollow interior space for a foam pad; 

and 
   at least one positioning member distinct from said 

upholstery material attached to said upholstery material and 
extending therefrom for attachment to a molding fixture to 

position said cover in said fixture for application of the foam 
pad to said cover. 
The cover of Claim 6 wherein said positioning member 
is an elongated string attached to and extending from said 

upholstery material whereby said upholstery material can be 
pulled by said string. 
The cover of Claim 7 wherein said string is an 
elongated string tie having opposite ends with enlarged heads 

at said opposite ends, said string tie extending through said 
upholstery material with one of said enlarged heads on the 

interior side of said upholstery material and the other of said 
enlarged heads on the exterior side of said upholstery material 

whereby said upholstery material can be pulled by said tie. 
The cover of Claim 6 wherein said positioning member 
is an elongated string tie having opposite ends with enlarged 

heads at said opposite ends, said string tie extending through 
said upholstery material at said one seam with one of said 

enlarged heads on the interior side of said upholstery material 
and the other of said enlarged heads on the exterior side of 

said upholstery material whereby said upholstery material can 
be pulled by said tie. 
The cover of Claim 9 wherein said one seam has two 
ends and two string ties extending from said seam, one tie at 

each of said seam ends whereby said ties can be pulled in 
opposite directions away from one another to straighten said 

one seam. 
The cover of Claim 6 wherein said positioning member 
is a flexible sheet material joined into one of said seams and 

extending therefrom to form a skirt extending from said one 
seam for attachment to a molding fixture to position said one 

seam in said fixture, said flexible sheet material being 
tearable where perforated at said one seam for subsequent 

removal of said sheet material.
