<ABSTRACT>
A fuel tank cap assembly is provided which includes a 
plug portion (34) sealingly engageable with a fuel tank 

filler pipe (26) and a cover portion (36) that is 
positionable in blending contiguous relationship with 

adjacent portions of the automotive vehicle body when the 
plug portion (34) is positioned in a sealing position with 

respect to the fuel tank filler pipe (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to automotive fuel tank
closures in general, and more specifically to
non rotationally actuated automotive fuel tank closures.In modern automotive vehicle design, it is desirable
to provide access to the automobile's fuel tank for a gas
station filler hose nozzle in a manner that complements the
aerodynamic and aesthetic approach to the design of the
vehicle body. Currently, the most commonly used approach is
to provide a threaded gas cap at the end of a fuel filler
pipe connected to the fuel tank with the gas cap being fully
contained within a small compartment closed by a fuel filler
door. Fuel filler doors are frequently hingedly connected
to a portion of the automotive body and generally present an
exterior surface which blends with the outer surface of the
automotive body. The multiplicity of components required to
achieve the design goals results in an outlay of cost and
weight that is not desirable in all circumstances.One approach (described in GB-A-2 239 007) to reducing the cost for accomplishing
the desired functions has been to construct the gas cap so
that it presents an outer surface that need not be enclosed
by a body conforming fuel filler door. In certain designs,
such an approach is aesthetically unacceptable. In others,
it is an extremely limited design approach because the
threaded gas cap must present a round surface to be outside
of the vehicle body in order to conform with any aperture
through which it will be inserted. That is to say, a
variety of shapes in the outer surface of the gas cap is not
possible. Patent specification GB-A-802174 discloses a fuel tank
closure for motor cycles having a plug which is a force fit
into the bore of the filler pipe of the fuel tank. An
operating lever pivotally engages the upper end of the plug.
The lever has one end formed as a finger piece and the other
end formed for contact against a fixed portion of the tank
to act as a fulcrum allowing the lever to lift the plug out
of the bore of the filler pipe.It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel
tank cap assembly which embodies an outer surface
complementary to the adjacent portions of the vehicle body
and which effects sealing engagement with respect to the
fuel filler pipe in an efficient and economical manner. According to the present invention, there is provided
in an automotive vehicle having a body with an external
surface, a fuel tank filler pipe having an open end adjacent
the body external surface and a depression formed in the
body external

<CLAIMS>
In an automotive vehicle having a body (12) with an
external surface (14), a fuel tank filler pipe (26) having

an open end (25) adjacent the body external surface (14) and
a depression formed in the body external surface and

defining a generally continuous annular surface (18) around
the fuel tank filler pipe (26), a fuel tank cap assembly

(20) comprising:

a plug portion (34) sealingly engageable with the fuel
tank filler pipe (26) solely by non rotational insertion

into the filler pipe to a rotatively fast sealing position;
and a cover portion (36) fixedly carried with said plug
portion (34) at one end of said plug portion (34) and having

an outer surface (22) distal said plug portion (34) that
substantially blends with the body external surface (14)

within said depression when said plug portion (34) is in
said sealing position;

characterised in that latch means (38,40) engageable with
said plug portion are provided for releasably securing said

fuel tank cap assembly in said sealing position and a spring
(66) is provided to urge said plug portion (34) away from

said sealing position toward a free position separate from
said filler pipe (26).
In an automotive vehicle, the fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in claim 1, wherein the latch means (38,40) is

positioned within the said depression (18).
In an automotive vehicle, a fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the said latch means

(38,40) constitute primary latch means (38) and there is
further provided secondary latch means (40) operatively

disposed between said cover portion (36) and said fuel tank
filler pipe (26) to selectively limit movement toward said

free position. 
In an automotive vehicle, the fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in claim 3, wherein the secondary latch means (40)

is positioned within the said depression (18).
In an automotive vehicle, a fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein at least one of said

primary latch means (38) and said secondary latch means (40)
is remotely actuated.
In an automotive vehicle, the fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in any one of the preceding claims, and further

comprising an outer seal member (62) operatively disposed
between said cover portion (36) and the fuel tank filler

pipe (26), and an inner seal member (56) operatively
disposed between the end of said plug portion (34) distal

the cover portion (36) and the fuel tank filler pipe (26).
In an automotive vehicle, the fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further

comprising a cover seal member (70) operatively disposed
between said cover portion (36) and said depression annular

surface (18).
In an automotive vehicle, the fuel tank cap asssembly as
claimed in claim 3, 4 or 5, wherein the secondary latch

means (40) comprise a latch assembly carried with said cover
portion (36) and having an actuator member (74) laterally

moveable with respect to the cover portion (36);

and a catch (90) engageable with said fuel tank filler
pipe (26) and linkage means (80) interconnecting said

actuator member (74) and said catch (90) to move said catch
(90) between a position preventing non rotatable movement of

said fuel tank cap assembly with respect to the fuel tank
filler pipe (26) and a position permitting such movement.
In an automotive vehicle, a fuel tank cap assembly as
claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further 

comprising a flexible tether (24) operatively disposed
between said fuel tank cap assembly and said vehicle body.
