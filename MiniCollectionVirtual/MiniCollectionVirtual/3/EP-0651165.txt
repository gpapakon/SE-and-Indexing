<ABSTRACT>
A motion transmitting remote control 
assembly (10) transmits motion in a curved path by 

a flexible core element (12). A flexible tubular 
conduit (14) slidably supports the core element 

(12) and includes an inner end fitting (26) 
comprising an annular flange (28) disposed at one 

end (18) thereof. An elastomeric 'vibration 
dampening isolator (34) includes a right half 

section (36) and a left half section (38) disposed 
on opposite sides of the flange (28). A casing 

(44) also includes right (46) and left (48) half 
sections which engage the exterior of the 

respective right (36) and left (38) half sections 
of the isolator (34). The right (46) and left (48) 

half sections of the casing (44) include coacting 
force-fit snap locks (50) for retaining the right 

(36) and left (38) half sections of the isolator 
(34) in operative engagement with the flange (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates generally
to a motion transmitting remote control assembly of
the type for transmitting motion in a curved path
by a flexible motion transmitting core element, and
more particularly to such an assembly including a
conduit having a vibration isolator disposed at one
end thereof.Motion transmitting remote control
assemblies are provided in many applications for
transmitting motion in a curved path by a flexible
motion transmitting core element slidably disposed
in a conduit. Although such assemblies are not
limited to use in the automotive environment,
typical automotive applications include the control
of automatic transmissions, clutches, accelerator,
and cruise controls, HVAC vents, and the like. The
conduits of such assemblies are supported at their
two opposite ends on a bulk head, fire wall, engine
bracket, transmission bracket, or other support
fixture in the vehicle. In many applications, the
support fixture vibrates while the automobile is in
operation, particularly when the support fixture
extends from the engine or transmission. A problem
arises when vibrations in the support fixture are
passed through the cable via an end fitting on the
conduit. There are assemblies in the prior art
where vibration dampening means are used to isolate
vibrations which normally pass from the vibrating
support fixture through the end fitting of the
conduit to the core element such that the
vibrations are effectively attenuated or dampened.
Examples of such prior art vibration dampening
means may be found in U.S. Patent Number 4,406,177
to Bennett, issued September 27, 1983 and U.S
Patent Number 4,726,251 to Niskanen, issued
February 23, 1988, both assigned to the assignee of
the subject invention. These
assemblies include an end fitting disposed around
one end of the conduit. The end fitting is
surrounded by an outer casing which attaches to the
support fixture to support the one end of the
conduit on the vibrating support fixture. A
resilient vibration dampener is disposed between
the casing and the end fitting on the conduit for
providing noise and vibration isolation
therebetween. In this manner, the casing is
completely insulated from the conduit by the
vibration dampener, and the vibration dampener is
held in place by the casing.As perhaps best shown in United States
Patent Number 4,348,348 to Bennett et al, issued
September 7, 1982 and assigned to the assignee of
the subject invention, vibration
dampeners are typically insert-molded onto the
inner end fitting of the conduit. In
