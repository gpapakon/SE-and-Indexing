<ABSTRACT>
Process for the stabilisation and reduction of CO2 permeability of bicarbonate solution containers, especially for dialysis, made by stamping a formulation of plasticised PVC in the form of granules ycomprising a percentage by weight of PVC resin, of plasticisers, of lubricants, of lubricant/stabilisers and, where appropriate, of antioxidants according to the directives of the Italian and European Pharmacopoeias for the use in question, as well as the presence of a stabiliser chosen from the group of calcium soaps possessing, in the linear direction, a hydrocarbon chain of length greater than 19 carbon atoms, substituted or unsubstituted dihydropyridines and mixtures of these substances in combination with a costabiliser consisting of an aroylacylmethane.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a formulation comprising:

polyvinylchloride;
at least one plasticizer;
at least one lubricant-stabiliser;
at least one lubricant;
at least one stabiliser chosen from the group constituted
by calcium soaps comprising, in the linear direction, a

hydrocarbon chain having a length greater than 19 carbon
atoms, substituted or non-substituted dihydropyridines and

mixtures of these substances;
an aroyl-acyl-methane as a co-stabiliser,

for the manufacture of components and containers intended to come
into contact with bicarbonate solutions and the reduction of the

permeability to carbon dioxide of these components and
containers.
Use according to Claim 1, according to which the calcium
soaps comprise, in the linear direction, a hydrocarbon chain of

length equal to or greater than 22 carbon atoms.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, according to which the
stabiliser is constituted by a mixture of zinc or calcium salt

and, alternately or jointly, by a calcium soap and/or a
substituted or non-substituted dihydropyridine.
Use according to Claim 1, according to which the
formulation of plasticised polyvinylchloride comprises, as a

percentage of its total weight: 60 to 68% polyvinylchloride; 25
to 33% of at least one plasticizer chosen from the group of di-or

tricarbonates, di- or trialkyl benzene and di- or
tricarboxylates; 3 to 8% of at least one lubricant-stabiliser

chosen from the group of epoxide triglycerides; 0.4 to 1% of a
stabiliser constituted by calcium soaps having a linear chain

greater than 19 carbon atoms and, possibly, calcium and zinc 
salts; 0% (zero
 percent) to 0.2% of a stabiliser chosen from the
group of dialkyl-dihydropiridine-dicarboxylates; 0.1 to 0.8% in

total of a mixture of lubricants constituted by penta-erythrol
esters, hydrocarbon waxes and dialkylamides of fatty acids; and

0.02 to 0.15% of at least one co-stabiliser chosen from the group
of aroyl-acyl-methanes.
Use according to one of the preceding Claims, according
to which the formulation comprises, furthermore, an antioxidant

chosen from the group of alkyl-hydroxytoluenes, the content of
said antioxidant agent added to that of said co-stabiliser being

comprised between 0.02 and 0.15% by weight of the total of the
formulation.
Use according to Claim 1, according to which the
formulation comprises 60 to 68% by weight polyvinylchloride; 25

to 33% by weight di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate; 3 to 8% by weight
epoxide soya oil; a total comprised between 0.4 and 1.1% by

weight zinc octanoate and calcium behenate, a total comprised
between 0.2 and 0.8% by weight of penta-erythrol-adipate-oleate,

paraffin oil and diethylstearamide, a total comprised between
0.02 and 0.15% by weight stearoyl-benzoyl-methane and butyl

hydroxytoluene and, optionally, 0.1 to 0.2% by weight
dihydropyridine.
