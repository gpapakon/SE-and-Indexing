<ABSTRACT>
A method for making and using a test fixture (10) 
for testing a packaged semiconductor device (44). The 

test fixture (10) includes a nonconductive housing (11) 
and a contactor assembly (30). The contactor assembly 

(30) has a contactor lead (31) and is removable from the 
housing (11). The contactor assembly (30) is mounted to 

the housing (11) such that the contactor lead (31) 
becomes interdigitated between upper cantilever 

structures (20) and lower cantilever structures (21). 
The test fixture (10) is coupled to a tester (46) which 

is between a first tool set (41) and a second tool set 
(42) of a trim and form apparatus (40). The packaged 

semiconductor device (44) is placed in contact with the 
test fixture (10) and tested.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
testing semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to 
testing non-singulated semiconductor devices which are 
attached to a leadframe. After fabrication, semiconductor devices are 
usually placed in packages for protection from mechanical 
stresses. The steps used in packaging semiconductor 
devices generally include mounting a plurality of 
semiconductor devices to a leadframe, forming wire bonds 
between the semiconductor devices and the leadframe, and 
encapsulating the semiconductor devices within a molding 
compound. Subsequently, the leadframe is trimmed, 
formed, and separated, thereby producing individual or 
singulated packaged semiconductor devices. Semiconductor devices mounted to a leadframe may be 
electrically tested after the trimming step because they 
are electrically isolated from one another. However, 
most semiconductor device manufacturers do not test the 
packaged semiconductor devices until after they have been 
singulated. Electrically testing the packaged 
semiconductor devices prior to singulation is tricky 
because the leadframe leads are in a very fragile and 
vulnerable position and may, therefore, be easily 
damaged. Any damage to the leads amounts to destroying 
the packaged semiconductor device. The probability of 
damaging the leads is reduced by performing the steps of 
trimming, forming, and singulation sequentially using the 
same apparatus.  Littlebury, in U.S. Patent No. 5,008,615 entitled 
"Means and Method for Testing Integrated Circuits 
Attached to a Leadframe" discloses a means and method for 
testing integrated circuits after they have been 
encapsulated but before they have been singulated. In 
particular, the technique of Littlebury relies on testing 
the encapsulated semiconductor devices after the 
leadframe leads have been partially "formed". Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a 
method for electrically testing packaged semiconductor 
devices prior to singulation. More particularly, the 
method should test the encapsulated semiconductor devices 
before the leads are "formed". Further, it would be 
advantageous that the method reduce cycle time and 
testing costs. The method should also reduce the number 
of times the singulated packaged semiconductor devices 
are handled. Briefly stated, the present invention provides a 
method and an apparatus for coupling a semiconductor 
device with a tester and subsequently testing the 
semiconductor device. In one aspect of the present 
invention, a test
