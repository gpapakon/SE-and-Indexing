<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of calibrating a tuner of a receiver of radioelectric signals; in particular for a television receiver, with a plurality of tuning circuits, each one including a varactor diode and coils obtained by way of a printing procedure, and to a television signal receiver using said calibrating method.As known tuners for radioelectric signals, in particular those for receivers of television signals, which can also be, apart from televisions, video recorders and the like, traditionally comprise an amplifier stage and a converter stage, in turn constituted by a local oscillator and by a mixer that mixes the received signal with that locally generated, according to the classical superheterodyne system.Said tuners usually provide 4 tuned circuits, three for the incoming signal and one for the signal locally generated.Such circuits, so as to enable the tuning in an electrical way, each comprise as a capacitive element a so called varactor diode, the capacity of which varies in accordance with the voltage applied.The tuning inductors on the other hand are traditionally obtained by way of coils, realised in copper wire windings in the form of a spiral spring, so as to enable their calibration by suitably deforming them by hand.The calibration is necessary for enabling the tuning of each circuit, with a sufficient precision, on the entire range of each of the signal bands to be tuned; usually the calibration of each of the circuits is actually carried out on two points for every band.The frequency synthesis tuners also require a calibration of the circuit of the local oscillator, as, even though the frequency synthesis system provides for generating the exact signal frequency, it is necessary that the corresponding voltage necessary for the respective varactor be comprised within the range of voltages provided, i.e. it is necessary that the tolerance on the inductor be comprised within tight values; the calibration must then take place on the other 3 circuits, so as to place them 'in step' with that of the local oscillator.It is known from the British patent application 2 187 906 an electronic tuner for television receivers equipped with a memory in which information concerning voltages for selecting each channel is stored.The document stresses that neither the selection of matched varactor diodes nor tracking is necessary, because the storing is made for each channel.This method however, beside having an higher cost, suffers the drawback of being subject to possible deformation
