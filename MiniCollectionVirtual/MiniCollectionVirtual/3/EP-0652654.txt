Method for detecting information which is
expected in a particular data block of the RDS data

stream transmitted in a predetermined number of
periodically successive groups, in a broadcast receiver

which is successively set to a plurality of
transmitters to be checked and the RDS decoder (16) of

which is synchronized (32) with the RDS data stream of
the respectively set transmitter, characterized in that


a) a counter (18, 20), which is incremented by the RDS
data clock signal and whose counter reading is in a

random relationship with the block sequence of the RDS
data stream, is reset each time a counter reading

corresponding to the number of bits of a group is
reached;
b) when the RDS decoder is synchronized with the RDS
data stream of the respectively set transmitter, the

counter reading of the counter is placed in a
relationship with the block sequence of the received

RDS data stream and a reference quantity identifying
this relationship is stored (32) with characteristic

data of the set transmitter in a transmitter table
(24);
c) when a transmitter whose characteristic data have
already been recorded together with the associated

reference quantity in the transmitter table (24) is set
again, the RDS decoder is not synchronized and the

position in time of the data block in which the
information is expected is calculated (38) from the

current counter reading and the reference quantity of 
the set transmitter read from the transmitter table

(24).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a counter reading which corresponds to the

beginning of a reference data block in the RDS data
stream of the respectively set transmitter is stored as

the reference quantity.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a counter reading which corresponds to the

beginning of the particular data block in the RDS data
stream of the respectively set transmitter is stored as

the reference quantity.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the counter comprises a

block phase counter (20) and a group phase counter
(18), in that the counting range of the block base

counter (20) is determined by the number of bits in a
block of the RDS data stream, and in that the group

phase counter (18) is incremented upon overflowing of
the block phase counter (20) and has a counting range

which is given by the number of blocks in a group of
the RDS data stream.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a transmitter whose

characteristic data have already been recorded together
with the associated reference quantity in the

transmitter table (24) is set at the instant of the
next appearance of the particular data block in the RDS

data stream of this transmitter.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that a transmitter whose

characteristic data have already been recorded together
with the associated reference quantity in the

transmitter table (24) is set at the instant of the
next appearance of the particular data block within a

group of a particular group type in the RDS data stream
of this transmitter.
