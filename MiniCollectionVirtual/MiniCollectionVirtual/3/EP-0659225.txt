A metal member (10) has two edges (14, 16), and a web (12) extending between them. A plurality of recesses (26) are formed in the web at spaced intervals. A plurality of struts (28) extend across the web (12) between adjacent recesses (26). Flange formations (30, 32) formed from the web (12) around the recesses (26) at an angle thereto so as to form the struts (28) have a generally channel shaped cross section, and forming intermittent flanges along the web edges at the side of each recess (26). Also disclosed are flange formations having oblique angled or curved shapes in section, in certain regions. Also disclosed are generally three-sided indentations (42), (44) formed in the web (12) at the root of each of the struts (28) which define apices extending partially into the end of the struts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a roll formed metal member
having generally axially located recesses and defining
transverse struts therebetween. The invention further
relates to a metal member having generally three-sided
indentations formed therein adjacent to the ends of the
struts.Roll formed metal members may be used for a variety of
purposes, as either structural load bearing members, or as
beams of various kinds, or in many non-load bearing
applications.Such members may be of a variety of cross-sections.
One typical member has a generally C shaped cross-section.
Other members may have a cross-section similar to a Z, and
other members may be of a T shaped cross section or an I
shaped cross section to name only a few.In all cases, however, it is desirable that whatever
the section of the member, it should have certain
characteristics.It should be strong enough to carry the load for which
it is designed, in the case of a load bearing member, and
even in the case of such members which are strictly
speaking non-load bearing members, it shall at least have
sufficient strength to withstand the forces to which it
will be subjected in normal use.It should be capable of being fabricated at high speed
by roll forming to minimise production costs.It should use a minimum quantity of metal, for a given
length, in order to both minimise cost and reduce weight.Numerous proposals have been made in the past for
designing such metal members having both reduced weight,
and increased strength, as compared with a plain unformed
section. Such proposals are almost too numerous to mention, but
are usually based on some form of combination of openings
formed through the member, or some form of indentations, or
flanges, formed in the member so as to increase its
strength and thus permit the thickness of metal to be
reduced, for a given load or application. One of the
principal problems with most of the earlier proposals of
this type is that it was simply impossible to manufacture
them by known manufacturing techniques, in an economical
manner.Continuous cold roll forming techniques for forming
longitudinal formations in sheet metal, and hot rolling
were not capable of both the piercing of openings through
the metal, and also forming indentations or flanges. For
many years, no equipment was known which was capable of
carrying out these functions on a continuously moving piece
of metal moving along a forming line. Accordingly, most of
these earlier proposals have been impractical, since they
could only be made on a typical
