<ABSTRACT>
Stacking device (1) for stacking groups of articles (4) on top of 
each other, the articles (4) being supplied to that stacking device (1) 

in 
a single stream and at a common first level, the device (1) comprising 

moveable elements (8,9,13,14,14') which are substantially parallel to the 
article (4) 

track, and which are adapted to receive one or more articles (4) each 
time, and which are designed to move through a first track section 

and a second downstream track section, wherein in said first track 
section, articles (4) are to be received and in said second track 

section, 
the articles are to be delivered at a subsequent level different 

to that of said first level, and means (3,18,19), in or beyond the 
second track section viewed in downstream direction, for positioning 

a group of articles (4), successively located at various levels, 
substantially on top of each other, wherein each time the level of 

said elements (14,14') in said first and second track part is 
substantially the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a stacking device for transporting articles
along a substantially straight-line assembling path and for stacking
articles that are supplied as a single stream on top of each other,
comprising:
a feed conveyor means for feeding articles in a transport direction
in a single stream at an infeed level,a downstream conveyor track located at a second level, below the
infeed level, the height between the infeed level and the second
level being at least equal to the height of a stack to be formed,drivers which are regularly spaced along, and movable in the
transport direction, said drivers extending transversely with respect to the transport
direction into the second and to the infeed levels,a transition region bridging the feed conveyor means and
the downstream conveyor track,an endless track carrying substantially equally spaced stacking
elements which are sequentially located at the infeed level, and at an intermediate
level between the infeed level and the second level, and
movable in the transport direction from the transition region for
transporting articles from the transition region substantially
parallel with respect to the assembling path, and combining means located downstream of the transition region for
placing the articles transported along the downstream conveyor
track and the articles transported by the stacking elements on
top of each other.Such a device is known from US-A-4,450,949. In this US patent a
machine is described for transporting and stacking cartons loaded with
containers. An outer chain which is provided with Teflon blocks forms a
feed conveyor which horizontally transport cartons at the infeed level.
An inner chain carrying rollers is placed within the width of the feed
conveyor. In a transition region located below the infeed chain, the
inner chain departs from the infeed level. Regularly spaced products are
transported along two different levels by both chains, to be later combined.
The known machine has as a disadvantage that relatively small
articles can be stacked only with difficulty as a number of chains runs
parallel in the transport trajectory of the products. This makes it 
difficult to support small products from a constructional point of view.
This is especially true for biscuits or candy bars which may have a
diameter of for instance 50 milimeters.Also may the change of position of the products over a sloping
conveyor track, which is later redirected in the horizontal direction
lead to inaccuracies with respect to the forward position

Stacking device for transporting articles along a substantially
straight-line assembling path and for stacking articles that

are supplied as a single stream on top of each other, comprising:

a feed conveyor means (2, 7) for feeding articles in a transport
direction in a single stream at an infeed level,
a downstream conveyor track (12) located at a second level,
below the infeed level, the height between the infeed level

and the second level being at least equal to to the height of a stack of articles minus the
the height of one article,
drivers (9) which are regularly spaced along, and movable in
the transport direction, said drivers extending transversely with respect to the

transport direction into the second and the infeed
levels,
a transition region (11) bridging the feed conveyor
means (2, 7) and the downstream conveyor track (12),
an endless track (13, 15) carrying substantially equally
spaced stacking elements (14) which are sequentially located at the infeed

level, or at the infeed level and one or more intermediate levels between the infeed level
and the second level, and movable in the transport direction

from the transition region (11) for transporting articles
from the transition region substantially parallel with respect to the

assembling path, and
combining means (18, 19, 21, 22, 31) located downstream of
the transition region (11) for placing the articles transported

along the downstream conveyor track (12) and the
articles transported by the stacking elements (14) on top of

each other,
characterised in that the

endless track (13, 15) is located along each side of the downstream
conveyor track (12), the stacking elements (14) are sequentially introduced

in the assembling path at the infeed level, and the intermediate
level in the transition region and are removed from the assembling 

path upstream from the combining means (18,19,21,22,31) for
supporting articles while the articles are being moved in the

transport direction by the drivers (9), said stacking elements being
movable parallel with respect to the downstream track substantially at a constant

height between the transition region (11) and the combining
means (18, 19, 21, 22,31), and in that the combining means comprises a discharge

conveyor (21) having fingers (22) extending along the height
of the stacked articles for transporting the stacked articles in

the transport direction. 
Stacking device according to claim 1, wherein the stacking
elements (14) are arranged in spaced groups, situated on both sides

of the longitudinal axis of the downstream conveyor track (12) at
sequentially different levels.
Stacking device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the transition
region comprises a sloping track (11) comprising

passages for allowing passage of the stacking elements in the
transport direction.
Stacking device according to any of the previous claims,
wherein the combining means comprises a driver (22) which is driven

in the transport direction at a higher speed compared to the arriving articles.
Stacking device according to any of the previous claims,
wherein the combining means comprise stationary article tracks (18,

19) located at the infeed level and/or at the intermediate level
for receiving the articles from the stacking elements (14).
Stacking device according to any of the previous claims,
wherein the stacking elements (14) are mounted on an endless chain

(13) which is guided and driven around a return pulley (15), wherein
the chain (13) lies in a plane substantially parallel with respect to the

downstream conveyor track (12).
