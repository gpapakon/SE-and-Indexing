A number of such compounds comprise 2-amino-substituted quinazolines (such* as terazosin, prazosin, tiodazosin, bunazosin, quinazosin and trimazosin and doxazosin) and other guanidines (such as Meobentine and Bethanidine) which are known medicaments known to reduce blood pressure in hyperactive subjects.This invention also relates to a number of novel intermediates (including novel ureas and novel guanidines) that may be used in the synthesis of for example the 2-amino - substituted quinazolines and guanidines and the methods of the synthesis thereof. Some of these novel intermediates that are guanidines may also be useful as accelerators in the manufacture of rubber and as activators for thiazole accelerators.
