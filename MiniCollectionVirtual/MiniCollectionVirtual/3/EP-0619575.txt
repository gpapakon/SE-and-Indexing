<ABSTRACT>
To quickly set the focus optics to an optimum condition on a repeated 
basis and to monitor the focus condition on a continuous basis an 

apperatus and method for monitoring the focus condition of a writing 
light beam comprises a laser (2) to form a slightly divergent writing 

light beam, whereby the writing beam is passed along an optical path to 
impinge, in focused condition, incident upon a writing surface (48) of a 

recording medium (50). The light beam reflected from said medium is 
directed in a reverse direction back through the optical path emerging 

from a diverging lens (34) in a slightly convergent condition. Then, 
this slightly convergent reflected beam is diverted downstream with 

respect to said diverging lens and impinges a light sensitive transducer 
(60) which produces an output signal varying in correspondence with the 

focus condition of said writing beam at the surface of the recording 
medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for
monitoring the focus condition of a writing light beam impinging
upon a writing surface of a recording medium.Systems for monitoring the focus condition of
a light beam used in reproducing prerecorded information
from a videodisc by a videodisc player are well known.
In prior art, a collimated reading light beam from a
laser light source is directed through a diverging lens
employed to shape the beam to fully fill the entrance
aperture of a microscopic objective lens which, in turn,
converges the beam to a focussed spot on the surface of
the videodisc. As the disc rotates, the pits or bumps
along the track of the disc cause intensity modulation
of the reflected beam which progresses along a portion
of the incident light beam path until it reaches a
polarizing cube which diverts the reflected beam out of
the path of the incident beam and focusses it on a
photodetector. As the intensity of the beam focussed
on the photodetector varies, the intelligence information
recorded on the videodisc is transformed into
electrical impulses which through a series of electronic
processes produces the video and audio portions
of a recorded program. In the player arrangement just described, the
reflected light is split off from the incident light
beam path in a region where the incident beam is
diverging. In this manner, the reflected beam entering
the polarizing cube, placed in the diverging portion of
the incident beam, produces a converging light beam
diverted to the photodetector. In analyzing the optics
involved in such a system, the fact that a cone-shaped
beam is produced by the diverging lens permits a pair
of conjugate points to be developed, one at the surface
of the videodisc and the other at the focus point on
the photodetector. Thus, the light split off from the
polarizing cube forms a focussed spot on the photo-detector
which has correspondence to the focussed spot
on the disc. Of course, if the light beam is out of
focus as it impinges the disc, the strength of the
signal detected by the photodetector will be less.
Accordingly, optimum focus and signal recovery can be
gained by monitoring the signal level developed at the
photodetector, adjusting the objective lens, focussing
the beam on the disc until a maximum signal is recovered,
and then adjusting the spacing between the polarizing
cube and the photodetector until the signal is again
maximized. At the optimum operating point, the conjugate
points of the optical path will be in focus at
the
