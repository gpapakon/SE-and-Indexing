<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process and apparatus for 
forming an outwardly rolled lip on a cylindrical 

container body. The apparatus of the invention includes 
a mandrel (30) having a cylindrical shaped portion (60) 

and a lip forming annular cavity (50) positioned 
coaxially with, and axially spaced from the cylindrical 

portion (60) of the mandrel (30). The annular cavity 
(50) has a generally semi-circular cross-section 

including an open mouth and a closed bottom extending 
outwardly of the mandrel (30). The mandrel (30) 

additionally includes a radially tapered portion (64) 
between the cylindrical portion (60) and the lip forming 

die (50). The radially tapered portion (64) tapers 
radially outwardly in the direction towards the lip 

forming die (50). An axial forcing means (52) forces a 
cylindrical container body (10) axially along the mandrel 

(30) towards the lip forming die (50) to thereby stretch 
the open end before the end is forced into the cavity 

(50) and rolled outwardly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a process and 
apparatus for forming an outwardly curled lip, i.e., 
rim, on a cylindrical container body. More 
specifically, the invention is directed to a process 
and apparatus for forming an outwardly curled or rolled 
lip on a cylindrical container body formed of a 
deformable material such as single or multiple layers 
of paperboard material. Non-metallic containers have achieved 
widespread commercial acceptance. These containers 
include a body made from plastic, paperboard, or a 
layered structure, such as one or more layers of 
paperboard having interior and/or exterior polymeric 
film or foil layers. Typically these container bodies 
are easier to manufacture, are less expensive, and/or 
are more environmentally acceptable than prior metal 
containers. In cylindrical form, non-metallic containers 
include a separate closure member at one or both ends 
of the cylinder. In some instances, the closure member 
may be a metallic closure member which is joined to the 
container body by outwardly rolling a portion of the 
lip of the container into a metallic flange of the 
metal closure, which is then crimped into the container 
body structure. Alternatively a peelable lidding 
member can be attached directly to a container body by  
 
means of a thermal seal formed between an integral lip 
on the container body and the lidding member. For plastic container bodies an integral top 
flange or lip can readily be formed during the molding 
process. However, for paperboard container bodies the 
lip-forming procedure is typically accomplished in a 
step separate from formation of the body, per se. For relatively thin walled container bodies, 
such as convolutely wound, frustoconically shaped cup 
bodies or cup bodies formed of thin walled 
thermoplastic materials, it has been proposed to form a 
lip on the upper end employing an apparatus including a 
splined surface support member as disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 4,680,016 to Lynch. The frustoconical container 
body is forced onto the frustoconical splined support 
and the open end is then forced axially into a semi-circular 
annular groove which initially forms an 
outwardly folded rim. Thereafter, a tucking finger, 
mounted at a rimming station, rolls the outward fold 
into a rolled lip as the mandrel supporting the 
container body is rotated. For relatively thick walled paperboard 
container bodies, for example, having a wall thickness 
greater than about 
0.381 mm 
(0.015 in.), e.g. from 0.508 mm (0.020 in.) to 1.397 mm
