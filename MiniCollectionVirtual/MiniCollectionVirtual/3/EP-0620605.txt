<ABSTRACT>
An air-guidance tube (11) is provided as an electrolyte circulation device for lead-acid accumulator cells. This air-guidance tube (11) is arranged alongside the vessel wall, projects into the lower third of the cell vessel (1) and is connected by means of its upper end to a T-tube (12), one of whose limbs (15) passes through the cell cover (5) and whose two other limbs (16) form hose connections (17). In order to simplify the construction, the air-guidance tube (11) consists of plastic, is flexible and dimensionally stable, is pushed in between the plate set (4) and the end wall (13) of the cell vessel (1), having an external diameter of less than 3.5mm, and the T-tube (12) is extrusion coated with the cell bushing around the upper end of the air-guidance tube (11). The restriction is achieved by the unobstructed cross-section of the air-guidance tube (11) being approximately 0.8 to 1.0mm. Simple fitting is made possible if that limb (15) of the T-tube (12) which passes through the cell cover (5) can be plugged in a sealed manner, by means of a sealing ring (18), into a diagnostic opening (7) in the cell cover (5) without the plate set in this case containing a special plate which is narrowed for the introduction of the air-guidance tube.

Use of an electrolyte circulating device for lead-acid 
accumulator cells whose cell cover (5) comprises a 

centrally disposed vent stopper (10) and inspection 
openings (7) adjoined by a respective inward projecting 

socket (8) and which, in the case of a standard 
construction, usually comprise an interspace (14) 

between the container wall and the edge of the 
electrodes (2, 3), the electrolyte circulating device 

comprising an air guide pipe (11) which consists of a 
flexible and dimensionally stable plastic, the outside 

diameter of which is so small that it can be inserted 
in the interspace (14) which usually exists, is of a 

length which extends into the lower third of the cell 
container (1) and is embedded in an airtight manner by 

way of its upper end in the branch (15) of the T-pipe 
(12) when the latter is produced in an injection 

moulding or transfer moulding process, and the branch 
(15) of the T-pipe (12) which is connected to the air 

guide pipe (11) being inserted in a sealing manner in 
the socket (8) of an inspection opening (7), while the 

two other branches (16) form flexible tube connections 
(17) for connection to a compressed-air line. 
Lead-acid accumulator with an electrolyte 
circulating device, the cell cover (5) of which 

accumulator comprises a centrally disposed vent stopper 
(10) and inspection openings (7) adjoined by a 

respective inward projecting socket (8) and which, in 
the case of a standard construction, usually comprises 

an interspace (14) between the container wall and the 
edge of the electrodes (2, 3), the electrolyte  

 
circulating device comprising an air guide pipe (11) 

which consists of a flexible and dimensionally stable 
plastic, the outside diameter of which is so small that 

it can be inserted in the interspace (14) which usually 
exists, is of a length which extends into the lower 

third of the cell container (1) and is embedded in an 
airtight ma
nner by way of its upper end in the branch 
(15) of a T-pipe (12) when the latter is produced in an 

injection moulding or transfer moulding process, and 
the branch (15) of the T-pipe (12) which is connected 

to the air guide pipe (11) being inserted in a sealing 
manner in the socket (8) of an inspection opening (7), 

while the two other branches (16) form flexible tube 
connections (17) for connection to a compressed-air 

line. 
Use of an electrolyte circulating device according 
to claim 1, in which the outside diameter of the air 

guide pipe (11) is less than 3.5 mm. 
Use of an electrolyte circulating device according 
to claim 1 or 3, characterised in that the clear cross 

section of the air guide pipe (11) is approximately 0.8 
to 1.0 mm. 
Use of an electrolyte circulating device according 
to one of claims 1, 3 and 4, characterised in that the 

branch (15) of the T-pipe (12) can be inserted in a 
sealing manner in any of the inspection openings (7) in 

the cell cover (5) by means of a sealing ring (18).  
 
Lead-acid accumulator according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the outside diameter of the air 

guide pipe (11) is less than 3.5 mm. 
Lead-acid accumulator according to claim 2 or 6,
