<ABSTRACT>
In its entry region along the entry slopes the cutting terminal has projections (7) separated from the clamping section by a shear edge (8). The bevels permit knife-like cutters against which the insulation of a wire pressed thereinto is reliably cut. In the clamping region the clamping arms are mutually parallel, thus preventing the wire core from being notched.

<CLAIMS>
Insulation piercing connecting device for connecting
insulated electric connecting wires, having at

least one clamping slot (3) which is formed between at
least two clamping limbs (2) which are parallel to one

another, as well as having run-in slopes (4) which are
formed at the free end of the clamping limbs (2) and are

formed at the frontal free end of the clamping limbs (2),
characterized in that the two clamping limbs (2) have

bends (7) along the inner edges, which are turned to one
another, of the run-in slopes (4), which bends (7) enable

the inner edges (for example 6) to protrude from the
plane of the clamping limbs (2), in that the bends (7) of

the run-in slopes (4) are separated from a clamping zone
of the clamping limbs (2) by means of a shearing cut (8),

and in that the bends (7) form a projection with respect
to the clamping zone.
Insulation piercing connecting device according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the bends (7) are bent

out in the same direction.
Insulation piercing connecting device according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the bends (7) are bent

out in opposite directions.
Insulation piercing connecting device according
to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the clamping

limbs (2) are formed so as to be aligned with one
another. 
Insulation piercing connecting device according
to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the clamping

limbs (2) are arranged offset with respect to one
another.
Insulation piercing connecting device according
to Claim 5, characterized in that the offset and 
the
bends (7) are directed opposite to one another.
