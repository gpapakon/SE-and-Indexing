<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
circuit device such as a semiconductor device or a 
liquid crystal display device and, more particularly, to 
an improvement of bonding between a passive chip element 
and a substrate. In recent years, to obtain a more compact, light-weight 
electronic circuit device, a method of mounting 
semiconductor elements and passive chip elements at a 
higher density to obtain a low-profile structure is 
proposed. Main conventional mounting methods are so-called 
wire-bonding mounting for placing a semiconductor 
element on a mounting substrate and electrically connecting 
the semiconductor element to the substrate 
through wires, fillet mounting for mounting a compact 
component on a mounting substrate, and the like. A facedown mounting technique for forming bumps on 
a semiconductor element and connecting this element to a 
substrate through these bumps to mount the element is 
recently developed in place of the conventional mounting 
methods. This facedown mounting technique has a higher 
manufacturing efficiency than that of wire-bonding 
mounting because the bonding operations can be performed 
at once. An example of the electronic circuit device 
obtained by this facedown mounting technique will be 
described below.  For example, FIG. 1A is a view for explaining 
fillet mounting, and FIG. 1B is a view for explaining 
bump mounting. A passive chip element 104 is mounted on electrodes 
102 on a substrate 101 through soldered portions 103. 
Reference numerals 105 denote electrodes of the passive 
chip element. Bump mounting can achieve high-density 
mounting due to the absence of fillets 100 extending 
outward from the passive chip element 104. FIG. 2 is a schematic view of an electronic circuit 
device obtained when a package incorporating a semiconductor 
device is mounted in a ball grid array structure. 
As shown in FIG. 2, there is a ball grid array for 
connecting a ceramic substrate 112 having, e.g., a 
semiconductor element 110 thereon, to a substrate 116 
through solder bumps 114. A facedown mounting technique for forming bumps on 
a semiconductor element to mount it on a substrate is 
developed in place of a so-called semiconductor package 
obtained by resin-molding a semiconductor device. In 
particular, the developments of mounting techniques for 
flip chips have advanced. FIG. 3 is a view for 
explaining this flip-chip mounting technique. In flip 
chip mounting, as shown in FIG. 3, solder bumps 126 
formed on a semiconductor element are reflowed to
