<ABSTRACT>
An injection for curing injured abnormal tissues which comprises 0.01-0.5M water-soluble aluminum compound, 0.5-20%, 
based on the aluminum compound, of tannic acid and sodium hydrogensulfite and has the pH value of 1.5 to 3.5. The injection is 

very stable even when stored for long, causes neither discoloration nor precipitation during storage, and is significantly efficacious 
in treating injured abnormal tissues such as cerebral aneurysm, hemorrhoid or hepatoma when it is directly injected into 

such tissues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injectable
preparation for curing affected abnormal tissues, a method
for the preparation thereof, and usage thereof and, more
particularly, to a stable injectable preparation for
curing affected abnormal tissues caused, for example, by
brain aneurysm, hemorrhoids, hepatic tumor vessels, and
the like, a method for the preparation thereof, and usage
thereof.Heretofore, oil-based phenol preparations have
been administered by injection as a procedure for curing
hemorrhoids. This procedure, however, is short in
sustaining the effects upon the curing of the hemorrhoids
and the hemorrhoids are caused to occur again in six
months to two years on the average. Hence, strong demands
have been made to develop pharmaceutical preparations that
can be injected under observations by the anoscope for
curing particularly severe hemorrhoids.On the other hand, currently, there is no
appropriate pharmaceutical preparations for combating
against the brain aneurysm and it is treated by surgical
operations such as craniotomy. Recent years, abnormality
of cerebral blood vessels can be detected in increasing
cases as image diagnose devices such as CT (computer
scanning diagnose device), MRI (magnet resonance image
computer scanning diagnose device) and the like have 
developed greatly and employed extensively. Hence,
pharmaceutical preparations in liquid form which can
prevent the rupture of the brain aneurysm have been
desired.In addition, fluid agents for obstructing blood
vessels, such as granular gelatin sponge, fibrinogen and
the like, are employed for curing affected abnormal
tissues caused by, for example, hepatic tumor. The effects
achieved by the treatment of such agents for obstructing
blood vessels, however, cannot be said sufficient and
satisfactory. In many cases, the affected abnormal tissues
caused by the hepatic tumor are treated by the hepatic
lobules exsection by laparotomy. Hence, strong demands
have been made to develop liquid agents which are
effective for the treatment of the affected abnormal
tissues caused by, for example, the hepatic tumor vessels
and the like and which can be employed in place of the
conventional agents for obstructing the blood vessels.As described hereinabove, the conventional
pharmacotherapy for curing the affected abnormal tissues
caused by, for example, brain aneurysm, hemorrhoids,
hepatic tumor vessels and the like cannot achieve satisfactory
treatment effects and cannot in many cases
suppress the symptoms thereof from occurring again.In order
