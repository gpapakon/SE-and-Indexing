<ABSTRACT>
A gravity type roller conveyor for conveying articles has a 
plurality of rollers (56) 

mounted on an elongated support member (24) which is movingly 
positioned within a 

base (22,26-30). The base is comprised of at least two components from 
a plurality of 

interchangeable modular components which can be assembled in a variety 
of ways 

to produce a base (22,26-30) which fits within given requirements. The 
cases are releasably 

secured to a frame (18) to complete the conveyor. The frame (18) has 
a plurality of mounting 

holes (38) in order to easily allow the changing in width of the 
conveyor. The base (22,26-30) 

incorporates one or more skid plates (28) to stop the articles 
on the conveyor. An 

elongated hose (72) is positioned between the base (22,26-28) and the 
support member (24) and, when 

inflated, causes the support members (24) to raise rollers (56) 
upwardly so that the rollers (56) project above the skid plates (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inclined gravity type wheel or roller 
conveyors. More particularly the present invention relates to an modular inclined 
gravity type wheel or roller conveyor which is assembled from a series of 
interchangeable standard components to allow the individual user to customize the 
wheel or roller conveyor to his own unique application. Gravity type wheel or roller conveyors are well known in the art and are used 
to transport articles from one point to another without the requirement for external 
sources of power to move the articles. A typical gravity type wheel or roller 
conveyor comprises an inclined, elongated frame having a series of wheels or rollers 
which are arranged along the frame with the rotational axes of the wheels or rollers 
being located perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the frame. Articles 
loaded onto the conveyor at its top or higher end are supported by a portion of the 
wheels or rollers. As gravity works on the articles loaded onto the conveyors, the 
articles move over the wheels or rollers towards the bottom of lower end of the 
frame. Different wheels or rollers support the articles as they continue their 
movement along the conveyor. While some of these gravity type wheel or roller conveyors operate effectively 
without any type of external control, when the length of the wheel or roller conveyor 
and/or the weight of the articles being conveyed increases significantly, it becomes  
 
necessary to add external controls to the conveyor to limit the speed and acceleration 
of the articles as they move along the conveyor. Various methods have been proposed to control the movement of the articles 
as they travel along the conveyor. Most of these methods involve the use of 
intermittently actuated brakes. One known gravity type wheel or roller conveyor 
employing an intermittently actuated brake utilizes a plurality of rubber support 
rollers having internal brakes associated therewith for intermittently stopping the 
wheels of rollers. However, successful control of the wheels or rollers can be 
achieved only when the operating conditions are precisely controlled. When 
variations in the operating conditions occur, the brakes do not always stop the wheel 
or rollers and thus proper control of the wheels or rollers, namely intermittent 
braking thereof, does not always result. Another known wheel or roller conveyor uses an elongated brake member 
positioned below the wheel or rollers. This elongated brake member is moved 
upwardly by
