<ABSTRACT>
A sheet feeding and corrugating system (10), especially for output 
of image substrate 

sheets (12,16) of a reproduction apparatus, wherein the sheets (12) 
are fed in a normal path 

through a sheet feeding nip (20) comprising plural spaced sheet 
feeding rollers (22). Both feeding 

and variable corrugating of flimsy or stiff sheets is provided 
by spherical balls (24) freely 

mounted in generally vertical ball retainers (26) providing for 
vertical movement and dual axis 

rotation against the sheet feeding rollers (22) to define the sheet 
feeding nip (20) and by additional 

similar balls (30) (in additional similar ball retainers (31)) 
intermediately of the feed rollers (22), 

which additional balls (30) are unsupported vertically except by 
bottom-of-travel retainers (32) so 

that these additional intermediate balls (30) roll gravity-loaded 
against a sheet (12) being fed through 

the nip (20) to provide sheet corrugation varying automatically with 
the stiffness of the sheet (12), and 

are freely liftable up to the level of the nip (20) by stiff sheets 
resisting corrugation. These balls (30) may 

be readily added to or removed to independently increase or 
decrease the sheet nip (20) and/or 

corrugation forces at their respective locations transverse the nip (20). 
A sheet side shifting 

mechanism (42) can laterally offset the sheets (12) in the same nip (20) 
to e
ject offset, by moving only 
the sheet feeding rollers (22), without resistance from the 

stationarily mounted balls (24,30), all of which 
roll freely laterally as well in the normal feeding direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for sheet feeding, especially sheets of 
varying properties, including transparencies. Proper and dependable sheet feeding is critical to dependable electrostatographic, 
ink jet or other reproducing machines, and more particularly, to the imaged copy sheets 
outputted by copiers and printers. A particular problem with many prior types of sheet feeding exit configurations is 
that they do not provide effective corrugation of the sheet as it exits. While normal paper exits 
cleanly without corrugation, transparencies or very thin (e.g. Japanese) paper, having a much 
lower beam strength, do not always exit completely or stack properly. There is disclosed herein a low cost and simple system for improved sheet feeding in 
which a desirable sheet corrugation for beam strength sheet feeding assistance desirably 
automatically varies with sheet stiffness. Yet, the system disclosed herein also accommodates 
contemporaneous sheet lateral realignment in the same apparatus. Another disclosed feature 
is the provision of simple changing of either the sheet feeding normal force or the sheet 
corrugating normal force. Various types of corrugating sheet feeders are known in the art, including various 
patent disclosures. Noted merely as some examples are those in U.S. 5,153,663, particularly 
disclosing conformable (deformable) rollers for variable sheet corrugation, and other art cited 
therein. An additional reference noted re variable sheet corrugation [in that case, varying with 
the document tray setting for document size], is the Fuji Xerox Corporation version of the 
Xerox Corporation "1075" recirculating document handler [RDH] as shown and described in 
U.S. 4,469,319. Corrugation by the same, fixed amount of all of the output sheets, including 
transparencies, per se, with idler rollers, etc., is used in various copier products, but not, it is 
believed, in combination with lateral sheet movement for offsetting. As to background re other art, ball-on-belt sheet transports allowing (planar) sheet 
lateral or side shift or rotation are known in the art for certain types of copy sheet output or 
other transports, e.g., U.S. patents 5,145,168 issued September; 4,733,857; and 3,861,673 [note 
the balls-on-balls 22 of this 3,861,673 sheet rotator transport, as in Fig. 4]. Also noted is U.S. 
5,145,168. Especially as xerographic and other copiers and printers increase in speed, and 
become more automatic, it is increasingly important to provide higher speed yet more reliable

<CLAIMS>
A sheet feeding and corrugating system for image substrate sheets (12, 16) of a 
reproduction apparatus, wherein the sheets are fed in a normal path through a sheet feeding 

nip comprising plural, spaced, sheet feeding rollers (22), the system including means for both 

feeding and variably corrugating flimsy or stiff sheets comprising: 

spherical balls (24) freely mounted in generally vertical ball retainers (26) providing 
for vertical movement and dual axis rotation against said sheet feeding rollers to define said 

sheet feeding nip; 
additional spherical balls (30) in additional generally vertical ball retainers (31) 
positioned intermediately of said sheet feeding rollers for engagement of a sheet in said nip 

with said additional balls; 
said additional spherical balls being unsupported vertically except by said additional 
ball retainers having bottom retainers (32) preventing said additional balls from dropping fully 

out of the bottom of said additional ball retainers, so that said unsupported additional balls are 
rolling gravity loaded by the weight of said additional balls against a sheet being fed through 

said sheet feeding nip to provide intermediate sheet corrugation forces with the extent of 
sheet corrugation varying automatically with the stiffness of the sheet being fed. 
A sheet feeding and variable corrugating system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
maximum extent of sheet corrugation is limited by said bottom retainers, and wherein said 

additional balls mounted in said additional ball retainers are freely liftable therein up to 
substantially the level of said nip by stiff sheets (16) resisting corrugation to provide self-limiting 

of stiffer sheets corrugation and no substantial resistance to sheet feeding. 
A sheet feeding and variable corrugating system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein said additional ball retainers provide for readily independently adding or removing 

said additional spherical balls therein, to independently increase or decrease the sheet 
corrugation force at those respective locations transverse said nip. 
A sheet feeding and variable corrugating system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, further including a sheet side shifting mechanism for laterally offsetting the sheets from said 

normal path through said nip so as to eject the sheets from said nip offset from said normal 
path, comprising means for moving said sheet feeding rollers relative to said normal path 

without resistance from said spherical balls or said additional spherical balls, all of which balls 
roll freely laterally as well as rolling freely in said normal path direction.
