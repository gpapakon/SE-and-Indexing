<ABSTRACT>
A microwave absorber in a pointed shape, comprising a 
phenol resin foam containing a dielectric loss material, is 

prepared by setting a incombustible sheet container 2 of the 
same shape in a mold having a pointed shape, pouring the phenol 

resin blending the dielectric loss material, and foaming and 
curing. As a result, a semi-incombustible or incombustible 

microwave absorber of high strength possessing a high microwave 
absorption capacity in a wideband is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microwave absorbers
used in RF anechoic chambers or the like, and a method of
manufacturing the same, and more particularly, to a semi-incombustible
or incombustible microwave absorber having excellent
microwave absorbing capacity, and a process for manufacturing
the same.Hitherto, the RF anechoic chamber has been widely
employed for uses of measurement of antenna characteristics,
and measurement of radio noise emission. In such RF anechoic
chambers, to eliminate reflection of microwaves in the chamber,
as shown in Fig. 10, the walls of an electromagnetic
shielding enclosure 3 are lined with microwave absorbers 4.The microwave absorber 4 is intended to absorb incoming microwaves
without reflection and to convert same into heat. In a
conventional microwave absorber 4, a resin foam impregnated with
carbon black or the like is used. It is often formed in a
pyramid-shape as shown in Fig. 11. Although the microwave
absorption characteristic in the high frequency region is inferior
to that of pyramid form, as shown in Fig. 12, a wedge-shaped
microwave absorber 4' is also known. Figs. 11 (a) and (b) show
a side view an a plan view of the pyramid-shaped microwave absorber
4, and Figs.12 (a) and (b) show similarly a side view and a 
plan view of the wedge- shaped microwave absorber 4'.As the resin foam, usually, foamed polystyrene, foamed
polyurethane, or foamed crosslinked polyethylene is used.Of these resin foams, in foamed polystyrene, beads of
foamable polystyrene are used in forming, and these beads are
relatively large particles of about 0.1 to 1 mm, furthermore, the cell
diameter of the foam becomes large, and a sufficient microwave
absorption is not achieved unless a lot of carbon black is mixed
in. The foamed polystyrene is limited to use in a relatively
low frequency band, and cannot be used in a high frequency
band of, for example, 10 GHz or more. Furthermore, since the
cut foamed polystyrene is fragile, the tip of the pyramid-shape
microwave absorber is likely to be broken, and hence
particular caution has been needed.On the other hand, the foamed polyurethane is soft,
and the tip is less likely to be broken if formed in a pyramid-shape Furthermore,
the cell diameter is small, so that it can be used in the high
frequency band of 10 to 100 GHz. However, to manufacture a
microwave absorber of polyurethane foam, it requires the steps
of jigging the foam, immersing the foam in a latex liquid
containing carbon black in a compressed state, releasing the
compression to
