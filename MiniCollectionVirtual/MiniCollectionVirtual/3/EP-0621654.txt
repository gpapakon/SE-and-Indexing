<ABSTRACT>
An active antenna array (58) for use in a 
radar seeker has a preselected number antenna elements 

(60) which are individually connected to an identical 
plurality of transmitting and receiving modules (64) 

backed up by a cold plate (66) for removing heat 
produced during use. In a preferred embodiment each 

module has a rectangular prism housing (84) within each 
of which there are individually modifiable phase and 

gain circuits (76,78). In a further embodiment, the 
transmitting and receiving modules are constructed of a 

number of wafers, each wafer having the same number of 
separate identical circuit function blocks as there are 

antenna elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna 
array, and, more particularly, to an active antenna 
array for use with a radar guided missile, for example. In certain kinds of missile systems, 
frequently referred to as guided missiles or missile 
seekers, an on-board radar system directs a radar beam 
towards the target and reflected energy received and 
processed maintains the missile on the desired 
intercept course. The sophistication of avoidance and 
jamming techniques, which can be employed for the 
benefit of the target in order to avoid a guided 
missile seeker or redirect it along a non-intercept 
course, have made it necessary to improve the missile 
seeker in order to overcome these defensive measures 
and enhance the probability of successful target 
intercept. Typical defensive measures produce false 
radar return signals, having the purpose of confusing 
the missile guidance system as to the actual target. Approaches employed in advanced missile 
seekers to defeat guided missile defenses, in a major 
part, recognize that RF signals will be received over a 
relatively broad angular field and electronic  
 
processing of these signals is required to enable the 
seeker to separate "false" signals from real target 
radar returns. In addition, in multiple target 
engagements (multiple real targets and/or multiple 
radar emitting decoys) the seeker must be capable of 
selecting a particular target located within the target 
cluster. A well-known guidance system, typically 
referred to as a gimballed seeker, mounts a high gain 
antenna on a gimbal assembly to allow the seeker to be 
pointed over a relatively large solid angle or scan 
volume. A servo system drives the gimbal which allows 
positioning of the antenna for both transmission and 
receipt of radar energy in a desired direction vithin 
the scan volume. The weight, cost, excessive volume 
and mechanical complexity of such systems make 
replacement desirable. Additionally, gimballed systems 
have traditionally had to be custom designed and 
fabricated for each new application. Another form of missile seeker utilizes 
electronically scanned antenna (ESA) technology which 
includes a large number of individual antenna elements, 
each of which has the capability to program the phase 
of the transmitted and received signals. In one 
version of an ESA, known as a passive ESA, the high RF 
power is developed in a separate transmitter unit and 
then partitioned among the numerous phase shifting 
elements. Since the phase shifting function is
