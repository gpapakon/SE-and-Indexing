<ABSTRACT>
A knife 10 for use with surgical fastening 
instrument for applying fasteners to tissue, the knife 

including a nonlinear cutting edge 16 having a first 
portion 32, a second portion 34, and an intermediate 

portion 36 between said first and said second portion, said 
first portion being positioned at least as distal as said 

intermediate portion. The cutting edge is configured to 
completely sever selected tissue while minimizing the 

potential for "wisping" of uncut or partially cut tissue 
away from the cutting edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for 
applying surgical fasteners to body tissue and for severing 
body tissue with a knife, and more particularly to an 
improved knife having a non-linear cutting edge for 
severing tissue when the cutting edge engages body tissue. In recent years, endoscopic, laparoscopic, and 
arthroscopic surgical procedures have become increasingly 
common. Endoscopic, laparoscopic, and arthroscopic 
procedures require the surgeon to cut organs, tissues and 
vessels far removed from an entry point into the body. In 
such procedures, the time and space to perform surgery is 
critical. Performing the procedure with the least number 
of devices possible reduces the risk of surgeon error, 
infection, and other potential complications associated 
with subsequent reintroduction of instrumentation into the 
body. As a result, multipurpose instruments capable of 
severing and adjoining tissue were developed to perform 
both functions during a single placement within a body. In these surgical operations it is often 
necessary to adjoin two hollow body organs along side each 
other, with their longitudinal axes positioned generally 
parallel to each other, and to effect a longitudinal cut  
 
through the contacting circumferential walls of the two 
organs in order to open them to each other. After joining 
the two organs, they essentially constitute a single hollow 
chamber along the length of the cut. Correspondingly, the 
circumferential portions of the two adjoining organs on 
each lateral side of the cut must be sutured by at least 
one line of "stitches" in order to maintain the integrity 
of the union. Instruments capable of performing both the 
severing and adjoining of tissue are known in the art, and 
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,079,606, 3,490,675 and 
3,499,591. Such multipurpose instruments are generally 
referred to as linear cutting staplers and typically 
include two elongated fingers which are respectively 
insertable into the tissue or into each organ from an open 
end thereof such that the two fingers have the adjoining 
walls of adjacent organs therebetween. One of the fingers includes a cartridge carrying 
a plurality of fasteners, typically staples, arranged in at 
least two lateral rows while the other finger includes an 
anvil for curling the staple's legs into a "B-shape" upon 
being driven against the anvil. The stapling operation is 
effected by a pusher device which travels longitudinally 
along the cartridge carrying finger extending into one 
organ.
