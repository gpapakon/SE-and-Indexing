<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing substantially dry GPC (glycerophosphocholine in enantiomeric form) from wet GPC without racemisation, comprises subjecting the wet GPC to reduced pressure and elevated temperature, to reduce the water content and give highly viscous GPC; adding ethanol or another suitable solvent and crystallising GPC therefore with cooling; filtering the crystalline GPC and removing solvent therefrom under reduced pressure; characterised in that the elevated temperature is at least 45  DEG C; and the solvent is added to the highly viscous GPC. This process produces an apparently new form of L- alpha -Glycerophosphocholine, m.p. 148-152  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing
substantially dry GPC, i.e. glycerophosphocholine, in
enantiomeric form.GPC is a valuable material, e.g. as an intermediate in
the preparation of pharmaceutical-grade phospholipids. For
this purpose, it is required in anhydrous form, but it is
then extremely hygroscopic. While various methods are
known for obtaining dry GPC, there is no published process
which is operable on a commercial scale.Hanahan, Biochem. Prep. 9 (1952) 55, describes the
preparation of GPC as its cadmium chloride complex,
following the deacylation of lecithin with alkaline
hydroxylamine, followed by neutralisation and extraction.
Tattrie etal, Biochem. Prep. 6 (1958) 16-19, describe
liberation of free GPC from the cadmium chloride complex
and subjection to reduced pressure and elevated
temperature, to reduce the water content and give highly
viscous GPC, at a bath temperature of 45°C; drying the
syrup under reduced pressure over P2O5; dissolving the
vitreous product in ethanol and crystallising GPC therefrom
with cooling; and filtering the crystalline GPC, washing
with ethanol and then ether and removing solvent therefrom
under reduced pressure. The product is described as
follows: "L-α-Glycerophosphorylcholine is a white
crystalline compound melting at 142.5-143° with sintering
at 141°. The crystalline diester is extremely
hygroscopic." It is reported that "the checkers were
unable to obtain a crystalline product".Brockerhoff etal, Can. J. Biochem. 43 (1955) 1777,
describe obtaining GPC from egg yolk lipids by
precipitation with acetone, removal of acidic phospholipids
over Al2O3, dissolution in ether and the addition of aqueous
methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. The precipitate
of GPC was dissolved in methanol, re-precipitated with
ether and held over P2O5: "The analyses indicated that the
GPC contained 1 mole of water." A practical method for drying GPC has now been found;
the process has similarities to that described by Tattrie
etal, but does not require the use of the cadmium chloride
complex as starting material, employs a somewhat higher
temperature in the first stage of water removal, e.g. 45,
50, 55°C or higher, and utilises anhydrous ethanol or
another suitable solvent directly on the highly viscous
GPC. Inter alia, it has been found that the use of
phosphorus pentoxide is unnecessary.Without wishing to be bound by theory, one reason for
the greater practicability of the novel process may be more
efficient first-stage drying, with a consequent greater
difference
