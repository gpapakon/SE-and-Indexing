<ABSTRACT>
The buffer is formed as a pad in shock absorbing material and is used for the protection of a vehicle in a loading bay, either by attaching to the vehicle or the loading bay. It is formed as a cylindrical buffer (2) in absorbing material and with a central horizontal axis of rotation (6) passing through the longitudinal centre. This axis is carried by a support structure (1), which is fitted either to the vehicle or to the bay. Variations in vertical heights caused by loading are accommodated by rotation of the buffer. Several buffers can be arranged in a variety of ways, i.e. in a longitudinal line, or vertical pairs.

Stop mounted on a loading/unloading platform 
or mounted on the rear of a lorry, comprising at least 

one buffer (2) formed from damping material for 
stopping the lorry (7) on the platform (9), 

characterised in that the buffer (2) is cylindrical 
and is traversed longitudinally by a rotating axle (6) 

disposed horizontally, said axle (6) being carried by 
a support (1) mounted on the platform (9) or mounted 

on the rear of the lorry (7). 
Stop according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the support (1) comprises a plurality of 

rotatable buffers aligned on the same rotating 
axle (6). 
Stop according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the support (1) comprises a 

plurality of parallel rotating axles (6), each 
carrying one or more buffers (2).
