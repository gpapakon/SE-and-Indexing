<ABSTRACT>
A non-dispersive infrared analyzer and method for 
analyzing a concentration in a gas utilizes an infrared 

light source and a cell configured to have a gas flow 
therethrough. The cell also has an infrared light 

passage through which a sample gas stream and an 
infrared light beam can travel. A sector has at least 

two filters for filtering infrared light, and is 
provided with the apparatus. The sector alternately 

inserts the at least two filters into the infrared beam. 
A detector detects wavelengths of the infrared light 

beam which corresponds to an absorption band of the gas 
to be measured, and a second wavelength which 

corresponds to an absorption band of the preselected 
reference gas. The detector receives the infrared light 

beam after the light beam has traveled through the 
sample cell. The detector generates an electrical signal 

based upon the detected infrared light, which is 
correlated with a position indicating apparatus to 

provide a normalized intensity ratio, which is used to 
calculate the concentration of the gas to be measured in 

the cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-dispersive 
infrared analyzer for detecting concentration 
of a preselected gas in a sample gas using an absorption 
band of infrared light which is characteristic of the 
preselected gas. Non-dispersive infrared analyzers are now widely 
used in measuring gas concentration of various types of 
exhaust gases in order to monitor the exhausts for air 
pollution, for measuring gas concentration in industrial 
processes, etc. One such non-dispersive infrared 
analyzer, as an example, is described in U.S. patent 
4,355,233 by Warnke et al. A prior art dual beam non-dispersive infrared 
analyzer is illustrated herein in Figure 5. Fig. 6 
depicts a rotating chopper thereof. In the Fig. 5, item 
1 indicates an infrared source, item 3 is a cylindrical 
sample cell, item 5 is an amplifier, item 6 is an electric 
circuit, item 7 is a motor, item 8 is an axle connected to 
the motor, item 9 is a position sensor, item 101 is a 
cylindrical reference cell, item 102 is a light collector, 
item 103 is a rotating chopper having a disc shape, and 
item 104 is a pneumatic detector. Item 103a of Fig. 6 is  
 
a first aperture located at an outer track of the rotating 
chopper, and 103b is a second aperture located at an inner 
track of the rotating chopper. The cylindrical walls of sample cell 3 and 
reference cell 101 are typically formed of aluminum. Both 
ends of the cylindrical cells 3 and 101 are equipped with 
cell windows through which an infrared light beam passes. 
The cell windows are made of plate which is transparent to 
infrared light, such as calcium fluoride, CaF₂. In practice, the infrared source 1 emits a wide 
spectrum of infrared radiation. The rotating chopper 103 
is operated to interrupt the infrared light by periodical 
rotation, for example, one rotation per one second (1 Hz). 
The infrared radiation travels to the reference cell 101 
through the first aperture 103a and to the sample cell 3 
through the second aperture 103b, respectively. In the 
sample cell 3, a specimen gas which includes the gas to be 
measured, flows through. The reference cell 101 is an 
airtight cell and is filled with a gas which does not 
absorb infrared energy, such as N₂ gas. The beam, having 
traveled through the sample cell 3 or the reference cell 
101, reaches detector 104 which has selective sensitivity 
of the infrared radiation band set to correspond with the 
absorption wavelength of a gas to be measured. Detector 104 can be a pneumatic detector, which 
is a one type of such
