<ABSTRACT>
The break away hose coupling for use in 
conjunction with a vapor recovery nozzle and for 

application within a fuel line, prevents untimely 
decoupling, only decouples upon the exertion of a predetermined 

amount of tension, prevents unnecessary 
leakage of fuel and vapors, and is fully reconnectable. 

The coupling (7) includes a pair of fittings (9, 11), 
for connecting to the fuel line, a sleeve (12) for 

housing the fittings (9, 11), and each fitting (9, 11) 
incorporating a check valve (18, 54) to provide for 

closure of the fluid flow passage (21, 48) and closure 
of the vapor flow passage (25, 62, 59) when decoupling 

occurs, a fluid chamber providing for flow of fluid and 
a vapor return passage, internal of the fluid flow 

passage, allowing vapor recovery in a concentric line. 
The device is pressure compensated to eliminate the 

effects of line shock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a means for
preventing and stopping fluid passage through a fluid flow line,
such as a gasoline line used in connection with a fuel dispensing
system at a service station, as when the line is severed.Particularly, a service station gas pump hose can be
severed or ripped and a loss of fluid and vapors may be
encountered, for example, when a driver of a vehicle drives off
with the gasoline nozzle inadvertently remaining within the fuel
tank of his automobile. This usually occurs in the self-service
station. This invention is especially useful when applied in a
fuel line functioning as a check valve to prevent fuel flow under
particular adverse conditions.There are an infinite number of valve means in the prior
art that furnish shut-off of fluid flow, and more particularly,
such mechanisms normally are utilized in fuel lines where fuel
may be dispensed, and generally in those situations when the line
comprises a fuel line leading from a gasoline dispenser to the
nozzle. One example is U.S. Patent 4,666,888 to
Arthur Fink.Another example can be seen in U.S. Patent No. 2,642,297
to Hanna, which discloses a break-away coupling that responds to
tension in the line which is mounted and is held together through
a combination of male and female connectors and detents that
provide bearing engagement between the two components. In 
addition, the U.S. Patent Nos. 4,617,975 and 4,691,941 to
Rabushka disclose various types of tension actuated couplers for
the use in the line that deliver gasoline to a vehicle from a gas
pump. The problems that have been encountered with the style of
coupler as disclosed in these prior patents is that they have a
tendency to leak. When internal pressure is exerted within the
fuel line, such as may occur when the pumping of the gasoline is
being performed, excessive pressures may build-up within the fuel
line and particularly at the location of the uncoupler resulting
in leakage. In some cases, the pressure, known as line shock,
has the tendency to force the uncoupling device to prematurely
come apart. This generally occurs in the type of break-away
coupling that is constructed having unequal internal surfaces
that cause greater fluid forces to be applied in one direction
upon one part of the coupling than is exerted upon the other.When spontaneous high pressures or line shocks are
encountered, the pressure exerted upon one component of the
coupling device in one direction, is substantially different from
the fluid pressure that may be exerted in the

<CLAIMS>
A break-away hose coupling for use in a fuel
dispensing hose comprising:


a sleeve (12),
first and second fittings (9, 11), said fittings
being slideably connected within said sleeve (12), said

fittings being held together within said sleeve by a detent
means (30, 32, 33, 34), said detent means being disposed to

release upon a predetermined established tensioning force;
a fluid flow passage (21, 48);
a valve means (18, 54) contained in each of said
fittings (9, 11); said valve means (18, 54) being disposed

to be open and allow fluid flow through the fluid flow
passage when the fittings are connected and disposed to

seat in respective valve seats (15, 47) to prevent flow
through the fluid flow passage when the fittings are

disconnected; and
a vapor flow passage (25, 59, 62),

   characterized by said vapor flow passage (25, 59,
62) being internal to the fluid flow passage (21, 48)

thereby allowing the coupling to be mounted on a coaxial
hose wherein the vapor flow passage is internal to the

fluid flow path; and

means (74) for blocking said vapor flow passage
when the coupling is severed thereby preventing the escape

of vapors into the atmosphere.
The coupling according to claim 1, characterized
in that said valve means (18, 54) comprises a check valve

(18, 54) in each of said first and second fittings (9, 11),
said check valves being opposed to each other, one of said

check valves having a hollow extension (60) therewith, and
disposed for engaging the other check valve during routine

coupling to hold said check valves unseated from their
respective valve seats (15, 47) to allow fluid and vapors

to flow through the coupling, and disposed to retract and
allow said check valves to seat on their respective valve

seats thereby shutting off flow through the coupling when
the coupling is severed.

in that said first and second fittings (9, 11) have finned

spider mounts (16, 50) secured thereto, each of said spider
mounts (16, 50) having a spider sleeve (24, 51) forming a

flow passage within said sleeve, each of said check valves
(18, 54) having a sleeve (22, 56) slidably mounted on the
