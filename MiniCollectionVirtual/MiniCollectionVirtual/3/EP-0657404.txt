<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat and oxidation resistive high strength
material used in structural body parts subject to bleaching in high temperature/oxidative
atmosphere, the body structure of an orbital space plane, a combustor, the
combustor for a gas turbine, a blade, and a nozzle; the present invention also relates
to a method for producing the heat and oxidation resistive high strength material.Concerning the fields in energy, material production process, and spacecraft,
developments in the heat resistive materials having thermal insulation, heat
resistance, and excellent resistance to environmentally induced damages are cited as
important technical topics for materials used under extreme environmental
circumstances.As heat resistive materials there are metallic materials, composite materials,
and ceramics to name a few. As far as heat resistive alloy is concerned, there is a
super alloy which has Ni, Co, and Fe as the constituent bases. However, Ni, the
main constituent of a Ni-based super alloy, has a melting point of 1455°C, and
therefore, this alloy cannot be used in an environment with temperature range that
goes beyond this point. For this reason, an environmentally induced damage
insulation layer is formed on the surface of this alloy. As one of the representative
examples, a thermal barrier coating (TBC) method is presented which involves
spraying melted ceramics of ZrO2 and Y2O3 into the middle layer of a super alloy,
produced with the purposes of relaxing thermal stress, improving adhesion,
enhancing oxidation resistance, and improving anti-corrosion at the surface.
Furthermore, JPA62-156938 describes a functionally gradient material (FGM)
which relaxes thermal stress by having the composition ratio of ZrO2 and Y2O3 
change continuously at the middle layer between the substrate and the ceramics.There are others such as an intermetallic compound and a high melting point
metal. Some of the intermetallic compounds as a heat resistive structure are Al
compounds of iron family (Fe, Ni, Co) and Ti, but these compounds leave some
room for improvement in terms of hardness, workability, and resistive to oxidation.
On the other hand, the high melting point metals of W, Mo, Nb, Ta etc., have high
thermal conduction and has good resistance against heat but has a weakness of
being abraded easily by oxidation; and therefore, there is a need to develop an alloy
having strength and resistance to oxidation or a surface process which imparts these
characteristics.Moreover, there are composite
