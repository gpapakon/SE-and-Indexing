<ABSTRACT>
The present relates to a disc cartridge for accommodating a 
disc therein, which comprises two shell halves opposed to each 

other, one of which has a spindle hole into which a spindle is 
inserted to rotate the disc, a head insertion hole located 

adjacent to the spindle hole into which a read and/or write 
head is inserted, and a shutter for closing and opening the 

head insertion hole which is slidingly moved along a guide 
portion formed at a front end of the cartridge, opposed to a 

reproducing apparatus. The disc cartridge is improved in that 
the other shell has an annular rib at its center portion so as 

to be opposed to a non-recording portion of the disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc cartridge
including a disc therein
as indicated in the preamble of claim 1.In general, recording medium such as a magnetic disc or an optical disc is encased
in a cassette case made of two shell halves. A hole into
which a spindle for rotating the disc is to be inserted is
formed in a central portion of the cassette case. Adjacent
to the spindle hole, a head insertion hole into which a
write and read head is to be inserted is formed in the
radial direction to traverse the recording surface of the
disc. The head insertion hole is opened and closed by a
shutter having an opening corresponding to the head
insertion hole.A disc cartridge according to the preamble portion of claim 1
is known from EP-A2-0 260 876. Another disc cartridge is known from GB-A- 2 082 371. A problem involved in conventional disc cartridges, as
disclosed for example in EP 0 248 908 A1, is the insufficient
support of the disc within the disc cartridge. Usually, the
disc is provided at its central portion with a hub, which forms
a projection that cooperates with the spindle hole so as to
rotatably support the disc in the cartridge.However, when the spindle for rotating the disc engages said
hub, the disc can be displaced so that one of the disc surfaces
is pressed towards one of the inner walls of the cartridge
shells. Accordingly, the disc may not be correctly placed
relative to the reading or writing head so that writing and
reading may be disturbed or even worse, the surfaces of the
disc can be damaged when slipping on the inner walls of the
shells under rotation of the disc, thereby deleting the
information contained on the disc.Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention, to
provide an improved disc cartridge of the type as indicated
above, providing an improved support for the disc in the
cartridge so that the disc is smoothly guided.According to the present invention, said objective is performed
by a disc cartridge according to claim 1. According to a preferred embodiment of the present
invention, the shell defining the spindle hole has an annular
rib provided along the periphery of the spindle hole.Thus, the disc is smoothly guided and kept at a desired
position.Further preferred embodiments of the present invention are laid
down in further dependent claims.Hereinafter, the present invention is illustrated and explained
in greater detail by means of preferred embodiments thereof in
conjunction with accompanying drawings, wherein:

<CLAIMS>
A disc cartridge including a disc (d) therein, which comprises: two half shells (1,
2) opposed to each other, one shell (2) has a spindle hole (3) into which a

spindle is inserted to rotate the disc (d); a head insertion hole (4), located
adjacent to the spindle hole (3) into which a read and/or write head (H) is

inserted; and a shutter (7, 40, 55, 56) for closing and opening the head
insertion hole (4) which is slidingly moved along a guide portion (G) formed at a

front end of the cartridge, opposed to a reproducing apparatus, 
characterized
in that
 the other shell (1) has an annular rib (83) at its closed center portion
which is opposed to a non-recording portion of the disc for contacting said non-recording

portion, and the annular rib (83) surrounds a recess (1a), said recess
(1a) being dropped from the inner surface of said other shell (1) so as to

accommodate a hub (20) projecting at the center of the disc in such manner
that the hub (20) does not abut the inner surface of the recess when the

annular rib (83) abuts against the disc (d). 
A disc cartridge according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the diameter of the annular rib (83)
