<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cam mechanism with a roller tappet (9) which rolls along a control curve (7) and by means of which a mechanism element (8) can be displaced into a first and a second functional position, a contact point (P1, P2) situated on the control curve (7) corresponding to each of the two functional positions. Due to deviations in their dimensions which arise during manufacture, mechanisms of this kind exhibit transmission errors and the invention aims to reduce these. For this purpose, a point on the running surface (13) of the roller tappet (9) which coincides with the first contact point (P1) in the first functional position of the second mechanism element (8) coincides in the second functional position of the mechanism element (8) at least essentially with the second contact point (P2).

Gear arrangement having 

a) a plurality of gear elements, of which at least one 
carries out an oscillating movement which is 

repeated, after one period has elapsed, in the 
course of a further period in each case, 
b) a control cam (7) formed on a first gear element 
(6), 
c) a scanning roller (9) which is mounted rotatably on 
a second gear element (8) and constitutes a third 

gear element, 
d) roller contact during operation between the control 
cam (7) and a running surface (13) of the scanning 

roller (9) during at least one period phase (T') 
which is repeated in respective periods, 
e) a bearing (11) which holds the second gear element 
(8), the second gear element (8) having one degree 

of freedom relative to the bearing (11) for a 
displacement of the second gear element (8) due to 

deflections of the scanning roller (9), mounted on 
the second gear element (8), as a result of a 

relative movement between the control cam (7) and 
the scanning roller (9), 
f) a first function position which is assumed in the 
respective period phase (T') by the second gear 

element (8) and defines a first contact point (P1) 
of the control cam (7) with the scanning roller 

located on the latter, 
g) a second function position which is assumed in the 
respective period phase (T') by the second gear 

element (8) and defines a second contact point (P2)  
 

of the control cam (7) with the scanning roller 
located on the latter, 
 
characterized in that
 
h) the two contact points (P1, P2) make contact with 

the scanning roller in each case essentially at one 
and the same point on its running surface (13). 
Gear arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the scanning roller (9) has a hub 

(15), rolling bodies (16) which roll along the hub (15), 
and a raceway (17), supported by the rolling bodies (16), 

with such a ratio of the diameter D1 of the rolling 
bodies (16) to the diameter D2 of the hub (15) that, in 

the second function position, the rolling bodies (16) 
assume at least essentially the same relative position 

relative to the raceway (17) as in the first function 
position. 
Gear arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that 


the second gear element (8) is a drive rocker of a 
transmission gear with an output rocker (18),
 
and 
provision is made for such different transmission 
ratios between a first deflection of a first system 

point (A1), which is fixed in relation to the second 
gear element (8) and a second deflection of a second 

system point (A2), which is fixed in relation to the 
output rocker (18), in the first and second function 

positions that these transmission ratios counteract 
any influence on the two function positions which 

results in the case of radial runout of the scanning 
roller (9) fro
m different transmission angles (Âµ) 
being effective between the control cam (7) and the 

second gear element (8). 
Gear arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that at least one of the two contact 

points (P1, P2) lies on a curve section of the control 
cam (7) constituting a dwell path.
