<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates with a method of producing in mammals, particularly in cows 
and calfs a state like pregnancy with persistent luteum corpus and absence of oestrum which 

improves fattening and results in significative weight gain of the animal. Furthermore, this 
state enables an effective handling of the animal. 
The method is carried out by inserting in the uterine cavity of the mammal a device capable of 
producing an anabolic effect combined with absence of oestrum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention basically relates with a device which was designed to be inserted in the
uterine cavity of mammals, particularly in cows and calfs, in order to improve fattening and
handling of the animals. "Handling" should be interpreted in the scope of this invention as the
action of placing the animals in different pasture parcels to assure an effective treatment.Intents of weight gain were effected in the past based on animal castration. In 1906, Livio
Dutto reported in "Cow castration" chirurgic practices of Nufer in this matter with ulterior
ovary ectomy. Furthermore, in the past century, Charlier and Degive carried out bloody
techniques of bonding ovaries. Dutto designed an ovarytome, an instrument which improved
Degive's techniques and this instrument was still used at present. However, it acts in bloody
and cruel manner and success is variable and essentially depends from the ovaries bond
position and their peritoneal revascularization.It is known that weight gain is a main object in cattle breeding, but another object of this
invention is the use of an unbloody method to be applied to the animals. The present invention
leads to this object by means of an unbloody technique which enables the production of
anestrous (absence of oestral period). The sexual cycle in the animals consists of four phases:
1) pro-oestrum which is the period in which increases the activity of the generative organs; 2)
oestrum or mating period which is the only time when the female is willing to mate and
coition is fruitful 3) metoestrum wherein the activity of the organs is decreasing and 4)
dioestrum which is the period of relative quiescence before the next proestrum.Specific hormones are involved in the compliance of this cycle. The ovulation is produced
during the oestrum which is the time when the mature ovule is released by the ovary. Once
ovulation is produced, the luteus corpus is developed and produces Progesterone, an hormone
of large anabolic effect responsive of maintaining pregnancy. In the case that fecundation is
not produced the luteus corpus is desintegrated by the action of another hormone,
Prostaglandine F2, and consequently a new sexual cycle starts. Prostaglandine is formed in the
endometrium. Basically, if Prostaglandine F2 is not developed, luteus corpus would persist in 
forming progesterone causing two important effects: a) anabolic and 2) absence of oestrum.The combination of both effects in significant increase in the weight gain of the animals.One of the objects of this invention is a

<CLAIMS>
Use of an intrauterine device to be introduced into the uterine cavity of
a mammal for the purpose of improving fattening in the mammal by producing a

persistent luteus corpus in the absence of oestrum in the mammal without hormone
treatment.
Use according to claim 1 wherein the device comprises a body of a
synthetic material formed in an inverted "V" shape which is surrounded with a copper

filament.
Use according to claim 2 wherein the synthetic material is nylon.
Use according to claim 2 or claim 3 wherein one end of the body is
provided with a tail for facilitating extraction of the device from the uterine cavity of the

mammal.
