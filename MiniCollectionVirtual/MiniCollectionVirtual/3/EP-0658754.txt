<ABSTRACT>
With respect to insensitivity to electromagnetically irradiated disturbances and to charge influences originating from the oil filling, as well as with respect to good long-term stability, this pressure measuring arrangement comprises: a pressure sensor having a basic body (12) and an associated diaphragm (10) with strain gauges (11) fixed thereon; a base (13) having connecting wires (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and having an oil filling stub (1) to which insulating material base the basic body is fastened and with which connecting wires the strain gauges are contacted electrically; a metal body (17) having a central cutout (18) in a cross-sectional surface (19), having a central cutout (21) in a cross-sectional surface (20) facing away from the cross-sectional surface (19) and having a bore (22) which connects the cutout (18) to the cutout (21), which cross-sectional surface (19) is connected in a sealing fashion at its margin to the base (13) and which cutout (18) accommodates the basic body and the diaphragm without touching these; a conductive film (23) having an opening (24), which film is arranged in the cutout (18) as close as possible to the strain gauges, covering them but not touching them, and being connected to a switching zero point; a separating diaphragm (25) which is inserted into the cutout (21) and seals it at its margin and an oil filling which is introduced into the cutouts and the bore.

A pressure-measuring arrangement comprising: 

a preseure sensor having a base (12) and an associated 
diaphragm (10) with strain gages (11) deposited thereon; 
a header (13) of insulating material with leads (2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8) and with an oil filler neck (1), 


said header of insulating material having the base 
mounted therson, and 
said leads making electrical contacts to the strain 
gages; 
a metal body (17) having a first central recess (18) in a 
first cross-sectional surface (19), 
a second central recess (21) in a second cross-sectional 
surface (20) facing away from the first cross-sectional 

surface, and a hole (22) connecting the first recess with 
the second recess, 


said first cross-sectional surface being tightly joined 
at its edge to the header of insulating material, and 
said first recess accommodating the substrate and the 
diaphragm without touching them; 
a metallic separating diaphragm (25) fitted in the second 
recess and closing the latter at its edge; and 
an oil fill in the recesses and in the hole, which oil 
fill covers the strain gauges (11); 
 
characterized by 


an electrically conductive foil (23) having an opening 
(24) for the oil of the oil fill, 


said foil being disposed in the first recess as close as 
possible to, and covering but not touching, the strain 

gages and connected to ground. 
A presaure-measuring arrangement as claimed in claim 1, 
comprising a preseure feed pipe (9) extending through the 

header (13) of ineulating material and the base (12) so as 
to ensure oil tightness. 
A pressure-measuring arrangement as claimed in claim 1 
or 2, comprising a caselike extension (17') of the metal 

body (17) on the header side. 
A pressure-measuring arrangement as claimed in claim 3, 
comprising a further electrically conductive foil (23') 

which is provided along the inside of the extension (17') 
and connected to ground.
