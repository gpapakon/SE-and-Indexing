<ABSTRACT>
Systems and methods are disclosed wherein a single set of consumer items
may be purchased by debiting any of a plurality of accounts stored on a smart card.

According to an embodiment disclosed herein, a point-of-sale terminal includes a
terminal processor, an item identification device, a terminal memory, and a smart

card reader. The item identification device may include a conventional UPC bar
code reader adapted to read UPC bar codes on consumer items. A cost table and a

plurality of item tables are electronically stored in terminal memory. The cost
table associates each item identifier (UPC bar code) with a corresponding cost.

Each item table contains a list of item identifiers, and may optionally associate
specific item identifiers with corresponding accounts. Each item table is uniquely

identified using an item table identifier. The terminal memory, item identification
device, and smart card reader are all coupled to the terminal processor. A smart

card is equipped with smart card memory for storing a plurality of data files, and a
smart card processor adapted to execute a software operating system for managing

the plurality of data files. Each data file associates an account identifier for
uniquely specifying a given account with an account balance and one or more item

table identifier. Accounts are implemented, for example, by service providers such
as Visa, MasterCard, Discover, ATM networks, food stamp programmes, other

types of welfare programmes, unemployment compensation, or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to portable smart cards and, more 
specifically, to systems and methods which provide a smart card having the 
capability to selectively debit any of a plurality of accounts. Advances in microelectronics have made it possible to place a vast amount 
of computing power within a small space. In fact, it is possible to effectively put 
an entire computer inside a credit card, creating thereby a "smart card". Because 
of the tremendous processing and memory capabilities of the smart card, it is 
expected that smart cards will replace conventional credit cards which, typically, 
serve to confirm the right of the card's holder to debit a given account. The memory in existing smart cards is large enough to hold the programmes 
and data of a number of service providers. That is, there is sufficient memory to 
allow, for example, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express, to coexist 
on a single smart card. However, in a present-day point-of-sale environment, 
state-of-the-art smart cards provide a payment structure whereby a set of items 
must be paid for by debiting a single account. If one chooses to pay for a single set 
of items by debiting a plurality of accounts, separate debiting transactions are 
required for each account. Examples of such systems are disclosed in Anderl 
et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,653, and Dethloff et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,837,422. An additional shortcoming of existing smart card systems is that they do not 
provide a commercially feasible solution to the problem of performing financial 
transactions for a plurality of service providers. It is believed that the reason for 
this situation is that a number of security problems have not been solved. One 
problem, for example, arises in connection with defining the card's owner and the 
powers to be conferred to this owner, relative to the files in the smart card's 
memory. Stated in commercial terms, the question is to what extent does the 
owner of a smart card (who may also be a service provider) have powers over the 
smart card that are inconsistent with the security that other service providers seek. 
For example, the system described in the Dethloff et al. patent requires the original 
service provider to enter additional information into the smart card before a new 
service provider can offer its services on the card. This information must be  
 
entered by the original service provider, even if the new service provider uses an 
account which is separated from that of the first service
