<DESCRIPTION>
 NONIONIC X-RAY CONTRAST AGENTS, COMPOSITIONS AND METHODSThis is a continuation in part of application Serial Number 764,644, filed September 24, 1991, a division of application Serial Number 450,693, filed December 13, 1989.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to novel X-ray contrast agents, methods of preparing them, radiological compositions containing such agents, and methods for X- ray visualization utilizing such compositions.Background of the Invention Nonionic contrast agents for intravascular and central nervous system visualization are complex molecules. As is known, the iodine in the molecule provides opacification to the X-rays, while the remainder of the molecule provides the framework for transport of the iodine atoms. However, the structural arrangement of the molecule is important in providing stability, solubility and biological safety in various organs. A stable carbon-iodine bond is achieved in most compounds by attaching it to an aromatic nucleus. An enhanced degree of solubility as well as safety is conferred on the molecule by the addition of suitable solubilizing and detoxifying groups. Further, nonionic contrast agents are particularly desirable compared to contemporary ionic agents due to the minimization of those pharmacological effects associated with colligative properties, e.g., osmolality.Several of the features that are desirable for intravascular and central nervous system nonionic contrast agents are often incompatible so that all such agents represent compromises. In searching for the best 

 compromise, the controlling factors are pharmacological inertness, i.e., jLn vivo safety, and high water solubility. Thus, the ideal intravascular or central nervous system nonionic agent represents a compromise in an attempt to obtain the following criteria: (1) maximum opacification to X-rays; (2) pharmacological inertness; (3) high water solubility; (4) stability; (5) selective excretion; (6) low viscosity; and (7) minimal osmotic effects.Illustrative nonionic contrast agents include N,N'- bis(2 ,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamido- 2 ,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide (Lin, U.S. Patent No. 4 r396,598) and 5-N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)acetamido-2,4,6- triiodo-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)isophthalamide (Nordal et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,250,113 and Rakli et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,396,597).There is a continuing need for nonionic contrast agents which meet all or substantially all of the foregoing criteria. It is an object of. the present invention to provide nonionic
