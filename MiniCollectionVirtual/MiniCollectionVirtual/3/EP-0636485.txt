<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is equipped with a printing head (1) associated with displacement members for executing a relative displacement of the printing head and of a document to be printed, in at least one direction of displacement (10), the printing head comprising a series of printing members (13) spaced from one another in the direction of displacement (10) at an effective spacing distance d greater than a reference spacing distance, whilst the displacement is executed at a rate corresponding to the reference spacing difference, so that an overlap between the successive printed bands is ensured.
