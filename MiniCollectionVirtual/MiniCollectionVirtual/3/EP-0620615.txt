<ABSTRACT>
A charger-side connector is moved toward a battery-side 
connector through the engagement of a positioning projection 

formed on the battery-side connector in a guide groove (21) formed 
on the charger-side connector by rotating an outer tube (20). At 

this time, the outer tube (20) is retained relative to an inner tube 
(10) in predetermined positional relation by straight grooves and 

plunger mechanisms. The retaining positions are determined in 
accordance with conditions of connection between power (11) and 

signal (12) terminals of one connector and power (11) and signal 
terminals (12) of the other connector, and therefore the rotational 

condition as viewed from the outside indicates the connected 
condition of the terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector, and more particularly 
to a connector having a rotation guide for guiding 
an Engagement movement by rotating an outer tube. A conventional connector having a rotation guide is 
shown in Fig. 13: One connector 1 has an external thread 2 
formed on an outer peripheral surface of an end portion 
thereof, and the other connector 3 has at its outer periphery 
a rotation ring 5 having an internal thread 4 threadedly 
engageable with the external thread 2. The two connectors 1 and 3 are disposed in opposed relation 
to each other, and the rotation ring 5 is rotated to 
threadedly engage the internal thread 4 with the external 
thread 2, so that the connectors 1 and 3 are moved toward 
each other, and are electrically connected together. By rotating 
the rotation ring 5 in the opposite direction, the 
connectors 1 and 3 are disengaged from each other, thereby 
breaking the electrical connection. In the above conventional connector with the rotation 
guide means, the electrical connection and disconnection is 
achieved by rotating the rotation ring 5; however, the 
electrically connected condition can not be easily grasped 
merely by rotating the rotation ring 5, and therefore there 
has been encountered a problem that a half-connected condition 
in which the connection is incomplete can occur. US-A-4 457 572 shows a connector the present invention 
starts from. This connector has a rather complicated internal 
structure with a plurality of biasing springs, ratchet 
teeth etc., making this known connector difficult and expensive 
to fabricate and liable to malfunctions in use. The present invention has been made in view of the 
above problems, and an object of the invention is to provide  
 
a connector with rotation guide means having simple and 
reliable construction and in which an electrically connected 
condition can be easily grasped, and a half-connected 
condition hardly occurs. Solution of this object is achieved by what is claimed 
in claim 1. According to the present invention a connector with rotation 
guide means is provided, comprising: an inner tube 
in which terminals are held therein; and an outer tube having 
a spiral engagement groove, which is rotatably mounted 
on an outer periphery of the inner tube, said inner tube is 
inserted into a mating connector having an engagement projection 
formed on its cylindrical peripheral surface, and 
said outer tube is rotated with said engagement projection 
engaged in said engagement groove thereby moving the two

<CLAIMS>
A connector with rotation guide means, comprising: 

an inner tube (10) in which terminals (11a, 11b, 12a, 
12b) are held therein; and 
an outer tube (20) having a spiral engagement groove 
(21), which is rotatably mounted on an outer periphery of 

the inner tube (10), said inner tube (10) is inserted into 
a mating connector (30) having an engagement projection 

(32b) formed on its cylindrical peripheral surface, and 
said outer tube (20) is rotated with said engagement projection 

(32b) engaged in said engagement groove (21) 
thereby moving the two connectors toward and away from each 

other; 
 
   characterized in that 


spring means (25) are provided acting between said inner 
(10) and said outer tube (20) such that said outer tube 

(20) is urged toward a start position, said outer tube (20) 
being rotatable between said start position where said 

outer tube (20) is disposed before starting the fitting and 
a completed position where said outer tube (20) is disposed 

after completing the fitting with respect to a positional 
relation between said outer tube (20) and said inner tube 

(10); and 
retaining means are provided for retaining said outer 
tube (20) and said inner tube (10) against said spring 

means (25) at predetermined positions so that said outer 
(20
) and inner tube (10) can be disposed in predetermined 
rotational relation to each other. 
A connector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said retaining 
means comprises plunger means (22) mounted on said 

outer tube (20) and biased toward an outer peripheral surface 
of said inner tube (10), and straight grooves (14a, 

14b, 14c) which are formed in the outer peripheral surface  
 

of said inner tube (10) and extending along the axial direction 
of said inner tube (10), said plunger means being 

retainingly engageable in said straight grooves. 
A connector as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said outer tube (20) is rotatably mounted on the outer periphery 

of said inner tube (10) but not movable back and 
forth relative to the inner tube (10). 
A connector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
terminals (11a, 11b, 12a, 12b) held in said inner tube (10) 

are a pair of power terminals (11a, 11b) for supplying a 
charging power, and a pair of signal terminals (12a, 12b) 

for transmitting information concerning the charging, the 
power terminals are slightly longer than the signal terminals 

such that electric power for charging is supplied to
