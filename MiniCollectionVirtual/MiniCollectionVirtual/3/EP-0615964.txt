<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aluminium nitride ceramics having
improved heat-radiation property which can be used as a variety of
electronics parts including a substrate for integrated circuits and
packaging material.Aluminium nitride ceramic (or AlN ceramics, hereinafter) or a
sintered article of aluminium nitride is obtained by sintering a powder
material consisting mainly of aluminum nitride. This aluminium nitride
ceramic possesses good insulation property, high mechanical strength and
high thermal conductivity and is easy to be bonded to metal conductors
and hence is expected to be used as a substrate for integrated circuits and
packaging material.When the AlN ceramic is used as a substrate for integrated circuits
and packaging material, a metallized layer is usually deposited on a
surface of the AlN ceramic, because electronic components such as
transistor, diode, IC and LSI can not be mounted directly on the AlN
ceramic. Such metallized layer is required also when a circuit pattern is
printed on the surface of AlN ceramic.In order to improve the thermal conductivity of AlN ceramics, it is
a usual practice and an effective technique to grow crystalline particles of 
AlN so that grain boundaries are reduced or eliminated. However, a
sintered article of AlN whose crystal particles are grown often possess
voids or defects caused by lack of crystal particles, although its thermal
conductivity is improved. A metallized layer deposited on such a
defective surface of sintered article of AlN does not possess enough
strength at an interface between the metallized layer and the sintered
article of AlN and will be a cause of such troubles as breakage in circuit
patterns and increment of resistivity in wiring lines.Since two requirements to improve thermal conductivity and to
improve surface smoothness are contradictory or trade-off, it is
impossible to produce AlN ceramics possessing high thermal conductivity
as well as high surface smoothness simultaneously by prior arts.An object of the present invention is to solve the problems of
known techniques and to provide AlN ceramics possessing high thermal
conductivity as well as high surface smoothness and methods for
producing the same.From the Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 14, n° 208
(C-714), 27 April 1990 and JP-A-02 044 084 it is known that the
surface smoothness and alkali resistance of an aluminum nitride
substrate, as well as the adhesion to the metallized layer of a
circuit board, may be improved by forming an Al2O3 layer on the
surface of the
