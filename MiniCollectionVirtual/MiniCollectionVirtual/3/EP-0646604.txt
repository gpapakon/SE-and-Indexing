<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of polyolefins by
homopolymerization or copolymerization of at least

one olefin at a temperature of 100 to 150Â°C and at
a pressure of 0.5 to 100 bar, in the presence of a

catalyst, comprising at least one metallocene and at
least one cocatalyst, wherein the metallocene is a

compound of the formula I
