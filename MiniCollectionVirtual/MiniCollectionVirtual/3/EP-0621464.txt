<ABSTRACT>
For measuring the flow, the compressed air is guided to two compressed-air inlets (26.1.1, 26.1.2) and distributed with equal pressure over their compressed-air outlets (26.2.1, 26.2.n) to connecting inputs (16) of flow measuring equipment having micro bridge airflow sensors (100.1, ... 100.n). After the measurement of its flow in the flow measuring equipment with micro bridge airflow sensors (100.1, ... 100.n), the compressed air is present at compressed-air outlets (25.1, ... 25.n) connected to their connecting outlets (17). The flow measuring equipment having micro bridge airflow sensors (100.1, ... 100.n) is connected via a BUS system (BUS) to a monitoring unit (ÃœE) via which the measuring results of the flow measuring equipment with micro bridge airflow sensors (100.1, ... 100.n) can be transmitted. The transmission of the measuring results is carried out in a potential-free manner via an interface having galvanic isolation. The measuring results from the flow measuring equipment with micro bridge airflow sensors can be interrogated by a monitoring computer with an allotted address.
