<ABSTRACT>
A heat sink, in particular, a diamond heat sink having very high thermal 
properties, used for radiation of semiconductor devices or compressors is provided, 

which comprises a plate-shaped substrate and fins for increasing the thermal 
properties thereof, the fins being combined with the substrate and being of a material 

having a heat conductivity of at least 1 (W/cm · K), for example, diamond. This 
heat sink is produced by a simple process comprising arranging a base material 

and fins for growing diamond in such a manner that the surface of the base matterial 
and the upper end of the fin are of substantially the same height by 

the use of a suitable supporting member, or by working the base material itself 
and growing diamond thereon by the gaseous phase synthesis method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of a heat sink,and in particular, of a diamond heat sink
having a very high thermal property, used for the radiation of semiconductor devices
or compressors.With the miniaturization and increase of processing speed of information
processing systems, the processing capacity per unit area of semiconductor
devices incorporated into the system is rapidly increasing. This results in an
increase of the quantity of heat generated per unit area in the semiconductor device
and the importance of maintaining the thermal properties thereof has been
watched with keen interest when designing a substrate on which components are mounted. Up to
the present time, a number of combinations of alumina substrates and metallic
heat sinks with fins have been used, but because of the low heat conductivity
(0.29 W/cm · K) of alumina, sufficient thermal properties cannot be obtained
even in combination with the metallic heat sink.The requirements for the thermal properties of a package on which semiconductor
devices are mounted have become more severe because of the increase of the heating
generated with the high effectiveness of the devices mounted on the package. Thus,
as a means for lowering the heat resistance of the package, for example, it
has hitherto been suggested to employ a higher heat conductivity material or
to improve convection and heat conduction by forced air cooling, forced water
cooling, etc.As a heat sink material for semiconductor devices having high thermal
properties, it has been proposed to use diamond, cubic boron nitride (CBN),
aluminum nitride, etc. However, these high heat conductivity materials
have the disadvantage that although their heat conductivity is higher than that of alumina,
etc., their production cost is higher. In particular, diamond is proposed
as a heat sink for semiconductors, since the gaseous phase synthesis technique
has recently been developed and progressed and a sheet-shaped diamond substrate with a large surface 
are can be obtained. However, diamond is much more
expensive than the ordinary materials of the prior art
and its high heat conductivity cannot effectively be
utilized, since fin-fitted diamond sheets cannot be
prepared and the joint use of a metallic fin-fitted
heat sink is required.The ordinary materials used for the package, for
example, alumina will meet with problems regarding
thermal properties when a higher performance device is
put to practical use in the near future. It is
believed that a problem will arise
