<DESCRIPTION>
 LUBRICANT FLUID COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR REDUCING FRICTIONAL LOSSES THEREWITH IN INTERNAL COMBUSTIONENGINESThis is a Continuation-in-Part of copending U. S . application. Serial No . 07/658 , 643 , filed on February 22 , 1991.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a lubricant fluid composition , and more particularly to methods for ensuring high lubrication ef ficiency to reduce friction-related power losses in internal combustion engines .Background of the Prior ArtThe use of lubricant fluids to reduce frictional losses in internal combustion engines is well known. Lubricant fluids typically contain either a hydrocarbon-based or synthetic principal lubricant oil, with additives selected to ensure that the composite lubricant fluid will serve to effectively lubricate relatively moving internal combustion engine parts under anticipated operating conditions.Over time, through both analysis and experience, various characteristics of lubricant fluids have been better understood and improved. This is usually accomplished by adding one or more additives selected to adjust specific properties and monitoring the 

 performance characteristics of the composite lubricant fluid. Additives such as viscosity index improvers are employed to control the viscosity, and pour point depressants are added as needed to control the freezing point of the composite lubricant fluid. Various detergent packages, corrosion inhibitors, and the like, may be added for their specific benefits.A variety of multigrade lubricant fluids have been developed and are found to improve engine efficiency as measured by reductions in fuel consumption. In a study by McGeehan, J.A. "A Literature Review of the Effects of Piston and Ring Friction and Lubricating Oil Viscosity on Fuel Economy", SAE No. 780673, it is noted that multigrade lubricant fluids give slightly better fuel economy in reciprocating engines than do single- grade lubricant fluids. However, very little is known as to why improvements in fuel efficiency and reduced fuel consumption are achieved by the use of a multigrade lubricant fluid. Various explanations have been proposed to explain this disparity, but these, by necessity, until now, have been based on measurements of a single film thickness made in the main bearing of an internal combustion engine. See, for example, SAE Reports Nos. 869376, 880681, and 892151. Other studies have considered the influence of cavitation in the lubricant fluid, in regions between relatively moving elements, as an important factor
