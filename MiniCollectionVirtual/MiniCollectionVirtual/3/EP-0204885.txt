<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to piezoelectric materials 
and, more particularly, to a 0-3 PZT-polymer composite for 
transducer applications and the like. Piezoelectricity can be explained as electric 
polarization produced by mechanical stress in certain 
substances. Piezoelectric materials, such as lead zirconate 
titanate (PZT), are used in a wide variety of applications. In 
hydrophone devices piezoelectric materials detect low frequency 
acoustic waves passively. Hydrophones are frequently made from 
single phase PZT. Large hydrostatic piezoelectric charge and 
voltage coefficients (dh and gh) are desired in these 
devices. Thus, even though the magnitudes of the piezoelectric 
coefficients d₃₃ and d₃₁ of PZT are large, the hydrostatic 
coefficients dhand ghare small, because the d₃₃ and 
2d₃₁ coefficients are almost equal and opposite in sign, and 
also, the dielectric constant of PZT is large. The large 
difference of the acoustic impedance between PZT and water 
requires impedance matching layers for underwater hydrophone 
applications. In order to improve and modify material properties for 
hydrophone devices, several different types of piezoelectric 
PZT-polymer composites have been recently investigated utilizing 
the concept of phase connectivity. It has been found that the 
electric flux pattern and the mechanical stress distribution 
together with the resulting physical and piezoelectric 
properties depend strongly on the manner in which the individual  
 
piezoelectric and polymer phases of the diphasic composites are 
interconnected. Each phase in a composite may be self-connected 
in zero, one, two, or three dimensions. Thus, a diphasic 2-1 
connectivity pattern, for example, has one phase self-connected 
in two dimensional layers, the other in one dimensional chains 
or fibers. Below are represented some of the composites with 
different connectivity patterns in which the piezoelectric phase 
appears first.
 
0-3 composites: PZT particles suspended in a polymer 
matrix
 
1-3 composites: PZT rods aligned in the poling 
direction held together by a polymer 
matrix
 
1-3-0 composites: PZT rods aligned in the poling 
direction held together by a foamed 
polymer matrix
 
3-1 and 3-2 composites: holes drilled in a prepoled PZT block, 
then the holes filled or 
covered by polymer.
 
3-3 composites: lost-wax method using coral as the 
starting material, or by a fugitive 
phase method (BURPS process).
 
The dh, gh coefficients and dh gh figure of merit of the 
diphasic composites are significantly
