<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing a beneficial effect on the immune system of poultry. (Lactobacillus reuteri) preparations administered to newly hatched chickens and turkeys are demonstrated to modulate the host animal's immune response. These preparations alter the host animal's macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, and NK (natural killer) cells in a manner that reduces mortality and morbidity losses, particularly when the animals are grown under stressful conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to stimulation of the immune system of animals, and in particular, relates to a method of stimulating the immune system by using a probiotic microorganism.Description of the Related ArtA number of inventions have been forthcoming from research and development on what is known as the Lactobacillus reuteri/reuterin system. L. reuteri is a species of obligately heterofermentative Lactobacillus found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of healthy humans, cattle, swine, poultry, rodents and all other animals examined to date, and it is reported to be the predominant hetero ermentative Lactobacillus species in these ecosystems [ 1-7] .PCT application No. PCT/US88/01423 discloses the discovery that L. reuteri is unique among lactobacilli and bacteria in general in its ability to produce and secrete a substance shown to have potent antimicrobial activity [2,8,9]. The disclosure of this PCT patent application and all other applications, patents and publications cited herein is incorporated by reference. This substance, termed reuterin, was isolated, purified, and chemically identified using (a) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) , (b) Mass Spectroscopy (MS), (c) Infra¬ red Spectroscopy (IR), and (d) by chemical synthesis. Using these methods, reuterin was proven to be an equilibrium mixture of monomeric, hydrated monomeric and cyclic dimeric forms of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) [10-13]. Concentrations of reuterin as low as 15 to 30 μg ml-1 were demonstrated to inhibit growth of Gram negative and most Gram positive bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and protozoa, whereas concentrations 4 to 5 times higher are needed to kill lactic acid bacteria, including L. reuteri 

itself [8,9]. This L. reuteri/reuterin system is believed to play a unique and important role in regulating and/or influencing the complex microbial ecosystem that exists in the human and animal GI tract, thereby having a beneficial influence on human and animal health.PCT application No. PCT/US92/00708 discloses that examples of oral administration of viable, host-specific L. reuteri cells to chickens and turkeys significantly reduces the numbers of Salmonella and other undesirable microorganisms that reside in their GI tract.This international patent application also discloses novel, commercial-scale methods for delivery and administration of viable, host-specific strains of L. reuteri to the GI tract of animals.

<CLAIMS>
THE CLAIMS What Is Claimed Is:
1. A method of providing a beneficial effect on the immune system of poultry, comprising providing Lactobacillus reuteri to said poultry beginning close to hatch in a manner effective to moderate T-cell activity, to increase splenic natural killer cell activity in stressed poultry, and to increase anti-Salmonella IgM antibody titer of previously Salmonella challenged poultry.
2. A method of providing a beneficial effect on the immune system according to claim 1, wherein Lactobacillus is provided to said poultry for a period of at least three weeks.
3. A method of providing a beneficial effect on the immune system according to claim 2, wherein the period is six weeks.
4. A method of providing a beneficial effect on the immune system according to claim 1, wherein Lactobacillus reuteri is provided orally to said poultry.
5. A method of providing a beneficial' effect on the immune system according to claim 1, wherein Lactobacillus reuteri is provided to the poultry at about 10
4
 to 10
7
 microorganisms per gram of a delivery medium.
