<ABSTRACT>
Method for measuring the radial force of a sealing ring (1) for a piston (2) or a rod (3), which sealing ring consists entirely of elastically deformable polymeric material, which is specified for use in a mounting space (4) and, in the radial direction, is limited on the one hand by a statically loaded sealing surface (5) and, on the other side, by a dynamically loaded sealing surface (6). The sealing ring (1) is elastically deformed with the aid of a calibration device (7) having the dimensions of the mounting space (4) and contacting the statically loaded sealing surface (5) with a mating surface (8) of a rotationally-symmetrical configuration and contacting the dynamically loaded sealing surface (6) with a measuring jaw (9) engaging at a location on the periphery. The radial force introduced from the sealing ring (1) into the measuring jaw (9) and the elastic deformation resulting from the mounting conditions are detected.

A method for measuring the radial force of a 
sealing ring for a piston or a rod, which sealing ring 

consists entirely of an elastically deformable, polymer 
material, is intended for use in an installation space, 

and is bounded in the radial direction on one side by a 
statically loaded sealing surface and on the other side 

by a dynamically loaded sealing surface, characterized in 
that the sealing ring (1) is elastically deformed with 

the aid of a calibrating device (7) which has the dimensions 
of the installation space and touches the 

statically loaded sealing surface (5) with a rotationally 
symmetrically designed counter-surface (8) and touches 

the dynamically loaded sealing surface (6) with a measuring 
jaw (9) which acts on a circumferential point, and in 

that the radial force introduced into the measuring jaw 
(9) by the sealing ring (1) is recorded during the 

elastic deformation resulting under the installation 
conditions. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sealing ring (1) for the rod (3) is pressed with 

its statically loaded outside circumferential surface 
(10) into a hollow-cylindrical, self-contained receiving 

device (11), in that the sealing ring (1) and the receiving 
device (11) are fitted onto a rod (12) which is 

divided in the longitudinal direction, and the sealing 
ring (1) surrounds the rod (12) with its dynamically 

loaded sealing surface (6), in that one rod part (13) is 
movable in the radial direction relative to the other rod 

part (14), and in that the relatively movable rod part, 
which is designed as a measuring jaw (9), is displaced  

 
radially outwards until the dynamically loaded sealing 

surface (6) has reached the nominal diameter which 
results under installation conditions. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sealing ring (1) for the piston (2) is pressed 

with its statically loaded inside circumferential surface 
(15) onto a cylindrical rod (16), in that the sealing 

ring (1) and the rod (16) are inserted into a hollow-cylindrical 
receiving device (17) which is divided in the 

longitudinal direction, and the sealing ring (1) touches 
the inside circumferential surface of the receiving 

device (17) with the outside circumference of its 
dynamically loaded sealing surface (6), in that one part 

(18) of the receiving device is movable in the radial 
direction relative to the other part (19) of the receiving 

device, and in that the relatively movable part of 
the receiving device, which is designed as a measuring 

jaw (9), is displaced radially inwards until the 
dynamically loaded sealing surface (6) has reached the 

nominal diameter which results under installation conditions. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the radial force which is exerted 

on the sealing ring (1) is picked up by a load cell (20) 
and is transmitted via an amplifier to a recording 

device. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the displacement path of the relatively 

movable measuring jaw (9) is measured by an 
inductive displacement sensor (21), and in that the 

displacement sensor is connected in a signal-conducting 
manner to an amplifier and a recording device, and in 

that the recording device displays s = 0 when the nominal 
diameter of the dynamic sealing surface (6) which results 

under installation conditions has been reached.
