<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a family of cellular receptors
involved in signal transduction, the seven transmembrane receptors, and more
particularly to the cloning and expression of DNA sequences encoding seven novel
seven transmembrane receptors.The seven transmembrane receptors (also known as heptahelical,
serpentine, or G protein-coupled receptors) comprise a superfamily of structurally
related molecules. Possible relationships among seven transmembrane receptors
(7TM receptors) for which amino acid sequence had previously been reported are
reviewed in Probst et al., DNA and Cell Biology, 11(1): 1-20 (1992). Briefly, the
7TM receptors exhibit detectable amino acid sequence similarity and all appear to
share a number of structural characteristics including: an extracellular amino
terminus; seven predominantly hydrophobic Î±-helical domains (of about 20-30 amino
acids) which are believed to span the cell membrane and are referred to as
transmembrane domains 1-7; approximately twenty well-conserved amino acids; and
a cytoplasmic carboxy terminus. The amino acid similarity among different 7TM
receptors ranges from about 10% to more than 80% and receptors which recognize
similar or identical ligands generally exhibit high levels of homology. The 7TM
receptors can be grouped based on their homology levels and/or the ligands they
recognize. For example, the interleukin-8 receptor, the angiotensin II receptor, the
thrombin receptor, the endothelin receptors, the N-formyl peptide receptor and the
C5a receptor all bind peptide ligands and share 20-40% amino acid similarity.7TM receptors recognize a great diversity of ligands (for example,
light, odorants, neurotransmitters, peptide hormones and small molecules) and
transduce their signals via heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) 
effecting a broad array of biological activities (including visual excitation,
olfactory reception, and neurotransmission) through various intracellular enzymes, ion
channels and transporters. Signal transduction pathways have been elucidated for
rhodopsin [Khorana, J. Biol. Chem., 267: 1-4 (1992) and Stryer, J. Biol. Chem.,
266: 10711-10714 (1991)] and the beta-adrenergic receptors [Dohlman et al., Ann.
Rev. Biochem., 60: 653-688 (1991)] and are thought to illustrate the pathways utilized
by other 7TM receptors. Each 7TM receptor is predicted to associate with a
particular G protein at the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane. The binding
of the receptor to its ligand is thought to
