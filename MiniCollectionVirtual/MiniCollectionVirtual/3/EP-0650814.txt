<ABSTRACT>
A feeding device serves for introducing pretreated plastic fractions, especially shredded plastic scrap, into a separation and washing apparatus having a liquid bath (1), in which plastics of a density greater than 1 g/cm
<
3
>
 and/or dirt, paper and other particles adhering to the plastic scraps are separated from the plastic scraps.   To avoid complicated devices for pressing down plastic scraps which have forced their way to the surface of the liquid, the feeding device is designed as a cyclone which can be charged with the plastic scraps at its entry area and which is connected in its inlet section to a liquid line, by means of which a stream of liquid can be introduced tangentially into the inlet section of the cyclone.

Device for feeding pre-treated plastics fractions,
particularly plastics chippings, into a separating and washing

installation with a fluid bath (1) in which plastics with a
density greater than 1g/cm3 and/or particles of dirt, paper

and other particles adhering to the plastics chippings are
separated off from the plastics chippings, characterised in

that the feeding device is constructed as a cyclone (2) which
can be supplied with the plastics chippings on its intake

surface (3) and in which its inlet section (6) is connected to
a fluid pipe (7) by means of which a stream of fluid can be

introduced tangentially into the intake section (6) of the
cyclone (2).
Feeding device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the intake
section (6) of the cyclone (2) is of cylindrical construction

and in which the cyclone (2) tapers conically in the form of a
funnel section (8) downstream of its cylindrical intake

section (6).
Feeding device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, in which the
cyclone (2) is connected at the outlet end (2) to a discharge

pipe (10), of which the end which is remote from the cyclone
is disposed below the fluid level (9) of the fluid bath (1).
Feeding device as claimed in Claim 3, in which the
discharge pipe (10) has a pipe bend (12) the outlet (13) of

which is so inclined with respect to the fluid level (9) of
the fluid bath (1) that the stream of fluid/plastics chippings 

(14) radiated from the outlet (13) is composed of a
comparatively large component (15) which is parallel to the

fluid level (9) of the fluid bath (1) and a comparatively
small component (16) which is directed vertically downwards

with respect to the fluid level (9) of the fluid bath (1).
Feeding device as claimed in Claim 4, in which the pipe
bend (12) is aligned with its outlet (13) in the direction of

a light material outlet of the fluid bath (1).
Feeding device as claimed in one of Claims 3 to 5, in
which a plate (17) is disposed in the fluid bath (1) above the

outlet (13) of the discharge pipe (10) and below the fluid
level (9) of the fluid bath (1) at a small angle with respect

to the fluid level (9) of the fluid bath (1).
Feeding device as claimed in one of Claims 3 to 5, in
which an injector (19) which works with water injection is

installed in the pipe bend (12) in the direction of a light
material outlet.
Method of feeding plastics chippings into a fluid bath
(1) of a separating and washing installation of a plastics

recycling plant, characterised in that the plastics chippings
(5) are introduced into a cyclone (2) in the principal axial

direction (4) of the latter, within the cyclone (2) they are
supplied with a stream of fluid radiated into the cyclone (2)

in the tangential direction of the cyclone, and are
transported with the stream of fluid below the fluid level (9)

of the fluid bath (1). 
Method as claimed in Claim 8, in which as the stream of
fluid/plastics chippings comes out of the cyclone (2) or a

discharge pipe (10) connected to the cyclone (2) it is
directed obliquely downwards, forming an acute angle with a

plane parallel to the fluid level (9) of the fluid bath (1).
Method as claimed in Claim 8 or 9, in which as the stream
of fluid/plastics chippings (14) comes out of the cyclone (2)

or a discharge pipe (10) connected to the cyclone (2) it is
radiated in the direction of a light material outlet of the

fluid bath (1).
Method as claimed in one of Claims 8 to 10, in which the
plastics chippings are prevented from rising within the fluid

bath (1) by means of a plate (17) disposed at an acute angle
to the fluid level (9) of the fluid bath (1) between the fluid

level (9) and the outlet from the cyclone (2) or the discharge
pipe (10) connected to the cyclone (2).
