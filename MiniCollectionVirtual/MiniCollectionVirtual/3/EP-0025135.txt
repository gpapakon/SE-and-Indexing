<ABSTRACT>
A selvage-knitting needle (21) for use in a shuttleless 
loom is attached at an angle to a support bar (26) which is 

angularly movable by rocker means (31) to enable an intersecÂ­
tion of the axes of the needle and support bar to substantially 

follow an arc of a circle. A pivot means (32) allows the support 
bar to move axially substantially through a point on the circle 

while the support bar is being angularly moved, so that the 
selvage-knitting needle (21) can reciprocate through a fixed 

point adjacent to the fell of a tape being woven for knitting a 
tight selvage.
