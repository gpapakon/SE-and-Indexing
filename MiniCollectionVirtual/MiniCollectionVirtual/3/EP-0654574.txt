<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a corner guide for the actuation of scissor mechanisms of skylight openers. The corner guide is to be capable of being used selectively for a spindle rod or for a push rod and is nevertheless to have a small (short) design. For this purpose, it is proposed to use a coupling member 3 which is arranged fixedly on a transversely elastic deflection band 2 and in which a composite groove structure 4; 4a, 4b and a thread 5 are made in such a way that the axis 5a of the thread 5 comes to rest in one of the grooves 4b of the composite groove structure 4. The composite groove structure 4 serves for the insertion of the front end of a correspondingly designed push rod 20. The thread 5, provided at the same time, serves for the engagement of a spindle-rod portion 12b mounted rotatably, but axially non-displaceably, in a bearing block 13 which can be attached to the end face of the corner guide with an accurate fit and without a screw by means of an elevation 14 and a recess 6 provided on the corner guide.

A corner guide for a fitting for actuating high-level leaves such as
windows or shutters, wherein a guide strip (2) in a guide (1) having an angle

of substantially 90Â° is guided for longitudinal movement and a coupling
element (3) is fastened to at least one end region of the guide strip (2; 2a; 2b)

wherein the coupling element (3) is held on the guide strip (2) and drivable in
translation, selectively


(a) by a push rod (20) movable in translation, wherein the push rod (20)
has a head for positive co-operation with the coupling element (3); or
(b) via a rotary drive rod which is fixed in the axial direction and moved in
rotation by means of a threaded connection (12b) between the coupling

element (3) and the rotary drive rod;
characterised in that
 the coupling element (3) is a block formed with a
longitudinal groove and a transverse groove (4; 4a, 4b) and the longitudinal

groove (4b) contains a thread (5; 5b, 5c), so that

in the case of the rotary drive the rotary drive rod is coupled by a
threaded connection in the form of a threaded spindle member (12, 12b) to a

separate coupling device (10) mounted on the corner guide, the threaded
connection being mounted in a bearing block (13) on a supporting plate (11)

and engaging in the thread (5) of the coupling element (3);
in the case of the push rod movable in translation, the push-rod head is
H or T-shaped and engages in the corresponding grooves (4; 4a, 4b) in the

coupling element (3).
A corner guide according to claim 1, wherein the thread (5) is split by
the longitudinal groove (4b) into two facing thread segments (5b, 5c). 
A corner guide according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the
thread (5; 5b, 5c) extends in the longitudinal direction across the transverse

groove (4a).
A corner guide according to any of the preceding claims, wherein one
(1a) or both (1a, 1d) straight portions of the corner guide (1) on the two sides

of the corner (1e, 2c) has a securing leg (1b, 1c) projecting substantially at
right angles to the guide (1) and inwards towards the guide strip (2) and

formed with a preferably round recess (6) near its end face in the end region
which points outwards in the longitudinal direction.
A corner guide according to claim 4, wherein the recess (6) is provided
centrally in the end region of the respective leg (1b, 1c).
A corner guide according to any of the preceding claims, wherein

the supporting plate (11; 11a, 11b) of the coupling device (10) supports
the bearing block (13) in which the threaded spindle member (12) is mounted

so as to be rotatable but axially immovable, and
the end of the threaded spindle member (12) pointing away from the
corner guide comprises an attachment means (12a) for the rotary drive rod

and, in the direction pointing towards the corner guide, the threaded spindle
member is in the form of a round rod comprising the spindle (12b), which fits

the thread (5) of the coupling element (3).
A corner guide according to claim 6, wherein the coupling (10) and the
end face of the leg (1c, 1b) of the corner guide can be secured flush but

releasably to one another. 
A corner guide according to claim 6 or 7, wherein the supporting plate
(11)


has a width adapted to the width of the leg (1b, 1c);
the portion (11a) of the supporting plate facing the corner guide has a
raised part (14), and
the raised part (14) is kept at a distance from the bearing block (13)
such that the raised part (14) can be inserted into the recess (6) and

simultaneously close the end face of the bearing block (13) flush with the end
face of the corner guide or of the leg (1c, 1b).
