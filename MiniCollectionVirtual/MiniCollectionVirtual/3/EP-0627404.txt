<ABSTRACT>
The selective esterification of a fatty acid and a polyalcohol is carried out by using, as a catalyst, zeolites and zeotypes of large pore, 
preferably with rings of twelve members (faujasite, mordenite etc.), with acid or base characteristics; saturated or unsaturated fatty acids 

with 4 to 22 carbon atoms are used, preferably oleic, palmitic, estearic and isoestearic acid, and diols or triols, preferably glycerine. The 
reaction is carried out at a temperature comprised between 100 and 190 °C, with pressures comprised between 5kPa and 200 kPa. The 

zeolites and zeotypes may be used as catalyst directly or included in a matrix such as Al₂O₃, silica, caolin, amorphous alumina-silica or 
any o
ther known matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
Alkylic esters of fatty acids of the oleic, palmitic, 
stearic type, etc. are used as special lubricants 
in the cosmetics industry and in the food industry. 
In the case of esters obtained by reaction with triols, 
such as for example glycerol, the tri- as well as the di-and 
the monoester have commercial usefulness. When esterifications 
are carried out catalyzing with mineral acids, 
a mixture of different esters that must be separated by 
distillation for the purpose of obtaining fractions 
enrichened in the mono or diester, depending on the use 
to be given to it, is obtained. It has recently been seen (patent JP 87225866 (9/9/87)) 
that it is possible to prepare highly pure diglycerides 
with a high yield, using an immobilized lipase. 
Kitano et al. for Lion Corporation also described in EP 
0 407 959 (16/1/91) with priority JP 17967489 (11/7/89 
(11/7/89) a "Process to produce monoesters of a polyol 
and a fatty acid" by means of an enzymatic reaction that 
is carried out by using an immobilized thermostable 
lipase. The problem has been attacked by transesterification 
of fatty esters with glycerol (DE 705203716950) 
using dry sodium carbonate. This reagent is described 
in patent ES 9001084 with priority JP 899844189 (18/4/89) 
of Montañola Martínez et al. for Kao Corporation 
"Process for the preparation of monoesters of fatty 
acids with glycol" wherein the esterification, at a 
low temperature, catalyzing is done with a mixture of  
 
carbonate and bicarbonate giving rise to a highly pure 
monoester capable of emulsifying crystals and useable 
as a cosmetic. Use of an amine as a catalyst is described in patent 
EP O 178913 of priority US 660728 (15/10/84) of Godwin 
for Exxon Research and Engineering Company "Preparation 
of glycol monoesters." Holderich et al. for BASF Akiengesellschaft in 
patent DE 3638010 (7/11/86) describe a "Process to obtain 
an ester of alkenecarboxylic acids" wherein the 
esterification is done between 50 and 450º C in the 
presence of zeolites /or phosphates as catalysts. The 
same authors and for the same firm describe in EP 0 312 
921 of priority DE 3735755 (22/10/87) entitled "Process 
to obtain unsaturated monoesters" also using zeolites 
and/or phosphates as catalysts. Heinrich et al. for Hoechst Akiengesellschaft 
describe in EP 0 406 767 of priority DE 3921917 
(4/7/89) a "Process to produce some esters of C22-C40 
monocarbonic acids" that permits obtainment of some 
esters with excellent thermal stability using an acid 
ion exchanger as a catalyst. Ankner
