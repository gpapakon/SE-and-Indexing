<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reagent 
composition for the quantitative analysis of inorganic 
phosphorus or phosphate contained in a sample and a dry 
analysis element including a reagent layer containing such a 
reagent composition. The quantitative analysis of inorganic phosphorus 
contained in blood serum or urine is an effective clinical 
chemical test for finding the mineral or electrolyte 
metabolism, similar to the analysis of calcium in blood 
serum, and thus it is recognized as one of the important 
clinical tests for the examination of disorder in kidney 
function, vitamin D deficiency, acromegaly, 
hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism. The quantitative analysis of inorganic phosphorus, 
which has been most frequently adopted in the art, is the 
phosphomolybdate reduction methods, the representative 
thereof being the Fiske-Subbarow method. In the 
phosphomolybdate reduction method, phosphate ions are allowed  
 
to react with a molybdate to produce phosphomolybdic acid, 
and then reduced by a reducing agent to be converted to 
molybdenum blue which is colourimetrically analyzed to effect 
quantitative analysis of inorganic phosphorus. However, 
this known method has disadvantages such that 
deproteinization operation, which is conducted by the 
addition of trichloroacetic acid or like reagent, is 
required. Further, the colour stability after the 
development of color is relatively poor to require strict 
time control from the colour development to the 
colourimetrical measurement. In addition, the reducing agent 
used in the colouring reaction has poor storage stability. 
These disadvantages induce inconvenience when the method is 
used for a clinical test wherein a lot of samples must be 
processed rapidly. This known method has further problems 
that metallic parts of the instruments used for analysis 
operation are corroded by the use of a strong acid and that 
formed dye pigments tend to be adsorbed to the vessels or 
lines of the instrument. These problems pose hard obstacles 
for the realization of automated analyzing system for the 
quantitative analysis of inorganic phosphorus. Particularly in the routine clinical tests in 
which a number of test samples are to be handled, it is 
demanded that the individual samples should be analyzed 
rapidly by simple operations, more desirably by automated 
operation sequence. To comply with the demand, dry analysis  
 
elements have been proposed 
(USP 3,992,158, EP 0097952A 
and USP 4,861,552) and United 
State Patent No 4,459,358.
