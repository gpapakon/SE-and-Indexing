<ABSTRACT>
The table consists of a stationary element (1) and of two elements (4, 7) which can be deployed, the longitudinal members (6, 8) of which, which carry the rollers (5), are displaced telescopically in the stationary element (1) and in the above element (6, 8) which can be deployed and, in their movement, entrain the rollers (5) of the above element which are placed on the table in one and the same horizontal plane. The rollers (5) are removed from a storage zone (15) arranged under the stationary table (1) by virtue of entrainment chains (10a, 10b, 17) with guide rolls (11, 18), the rollers (5) being concentric with the rolls (11, 18) of the chains. Application to the handling of loads and parcels.

Telescopic table with roller conveyor 
comprising a fixed support frame (1) supported by feet 

(2), an intermediate deployable member (7) of which the 
side frame members (8) are displaceable in telescopic 

fashion in the fixed framework and a primary deployable 
member (4) on the side frame members (6) of which are 

directly fixed rollers (5) and which can move in 
telescopic fashion in the intermediate deployable member, 

the said primary deployable member entraining during its 

movement the rollers of the preceding member which locate 
themselves on the table in an even horizontal plane, the 

said rollers being extracted from a storage zone (15) 
located under the fixed table by means of at least one 

entrainment chain (10, 17), characterised in that the 
intermediate deployable member (7) is displaceable 

between two U-shaped bars (9) of the support frame (1) 
which are formed by two superimposed portions (9a, 9b) of 

which the upper bar (9a) encloses a first entrainment 
chain (10) of which the axles (13) of the guide rollers 

(11) carry the rollers (5), in that the primary 
deployable member (4) can be displaced between two U-shaped 

bars (8) of the intermediate element which are 
formed two superimposed parts (8a, 8b) of which the upper 

part (8a) encloses another entrainment chain (17), the 
axes of the guide rollers of which (18) carry rollers (5) 

and in that the deployable elements are provided with a 
locking system (23, 27) against the exit of a deployable 

element and with an abutment system (29, 33, 35) against 
re-entry of a deployable element. 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that its support frame (1) is supported 

by feet (2), each of which is formed of tubes fitting 
together permitting the raising of all or part of the 

chassis of the table. 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1,  
 

characterised in that the fixed support frame (1) is 
provided on its two lateral internal faces with runners 

(14) emerging from the projection of the bars (9) and 
abutting on a storage zone (15) for the chain (10) and 

the rollers which it carries. 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the final interior link (10b) of 

the chain (10) is connected to the first exterior link 
(17a) of the chain (17) by a bridge member (16), the said 

first link being rigidly fixed to the end of the side 
frame member. 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that reaction rollers (19) are fixed 

here and there on the exterior of the lower bar (8b) of 
the intermediate member (7) and are displaced in the 

interior of the lower bar (9b) of the support framework 
(1). 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that reaction rollers (21) are fixed 

here and there on the exterior to the side frame member 
(6) of the first member (4) and which can be displaced in 

the interior of the lower bar (8b) of the intermediate 
member (7). 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the locking system for the 

intermediate member (7) during the first emergent phase 
of the first member (4) is formed by a shaped rocker (23) 

carried by the end of a lower bar (8b) of the 
intermediate member (7) which cooperates with a fixed 

cross-member (27) fast to the support frame (1). 
Telescopic table according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the rocker (23) is a plate cut out 

in a V-shape, the lower part of which forms a tooth (24), 
which plate pivots on an axle (26) bolted on the end of 

the lower bar (8b) and in that the said rocker projects 
into the said bar and can be rocked by a reaction roller 

(21) in order to be unlocked from the cross-member (27).  
 
Telescopic table according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the abutment system preventing the 

re-entry of the first member (4) into the interior of the 
intermediate member (7) is formed by a retractable tappet 

(29) carried by the said first element which cooperates 
with a flat tab (35) fixed to the intermediate element. 
Telescopic table according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that one end of the retractable tappet 

(29) carries a turning roller (31) and a transverse 
abutment (33). 
Telescopic table according to Claims 7 and 9, 
characterised in that the cross-member (27) fixed to the 

support frame (1) carries a ramp (36) serving to rock the 
retractable tappet (29) because of its turning roller 

(31).
