<ABSTRACT>
The electrical resistor element (10) contains, arranged between two plane-parallel electrodes (1, 2) exposed to pressure, a resistor body (3) having a positive temperature characteristic and comprising a polymer matrix and two filler components of electrically conductive particles embedded in the polymer matrix (4). When a short-circuit occurs, the resistivity of the resistor body (3) changes suddenly above a temperature limit value in a surface layer located on the electrodes and containing at least a first of the two filler components. A second of the two filler components is selected such that a binder material containing at least a polymer matrix and a second filler component has a positive temperature characteristic with a step response which is at least an order of magnitude higher than the surface layer. At the same time, this binder material has a resistivity which is at least an order of magnitude less than a binder material formed by polymer matrix and a first filter component. The resistor element has a high rated current-carrying capacity and can limit large short-circuit currents with long-lasting effect.
