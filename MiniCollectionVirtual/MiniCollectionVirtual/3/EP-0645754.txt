<ABSTRACT>
Device for imitating the sound of a plectrum 
instrument, including: 


-- a microprocessor (3) which is suitable to convert a 
chord set up on a keyboard (13), received by means of a 

standardized signal, into a chord which is identical but 
is, in terms of fingering and number of strings, of the 

type obtained on the instrument to be imitated; 
-- elements (7,19), equal in number to the strings of 
the instrument to be imitated, which are suitable to 

sequentially undergo a change in state caused by the hand 
of a user (12) who performs a movement that is identical to 

the one made to obtain the sound of the instrument to be 
imitated, and are suitable to send, as a consequence of 

said change, a signal to said microprocessor (3) to 
transmit said chord to a sound card by means of a 

standardized signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
imitating the sound of a plectrum instrument.It is known that in the field of musical instruments
there are instruments which include a keyboard connected to
electronic equipment by means of which it is possible to
imitate the sounds of many instruments: thus, by playing a
certain chord on the keyboard, that chord will be heard as
if it were played by a flute, a saxophone, or any
instrument, according to the selection made by the user by
pressing different buttons.Commercially available instruments are all
standardized, most of them according to a system known as
MIDI: a chord played on the keyboard corresponds to the
external output of a standardized signal and to a
simultaneous signal to a sound card which is suitable to
emit the sound and is contained within the instrument;
external signals may also reach the sound card, and it is
furthermore possible to interrupt communication between the
keyboard and the sound card.Instruments known as "sequencers" are also
commercially available: these instruments emit standardized
signals which are suitable for being received by a sound
card to create an entire piece of music, and each emitted
signal corresponds to a recorded chord originally set up on
a keyboard.The above described instruments allow to imitate
excellently the sound of a vast number of different
instruments but not of plectrum instruments such as the
guitar or the mandolin, because in these instruments a 
chord is produced by a fingering, i.e. an action of the
fingers, which is very different from the action used at the
keyboard (it is enough merely to consider, for example, that
the same chord is formed by pressing three keys on the
keyboard and six strings on a guitar neck), and because the
strings of plectrum instruments form the chord by acting at
a very short time interval from each other due to contact
with the user's descending and ascending hand.EP-A-0 251 329 discloses a an electronic stringed
instrument which is connected to an apparatus capable of
simulating a standard stringed instrument. The electronic
stringed instrument sends generates a tone generation start
instruction signal and supplies such signal to the apparatus
where a tone generation processing is performed in order to
generate a predetermined musical tone. However, the user
must be able to play a stringed instrument since the
standard technique must be used on the electronic stringed
instrument.The aim of the present invention is to provide a device
which, when coupled to a

<CLAIMS>
A device for imitating the sound of a plectrum
instrument, comprising:


a microprocessor which is suitable to convert an input
signal, representative of a chord set up on a keyboard (13),

into a chord which is identical to the chord set up on the
keyboard but is, in terms of fingering and number of

strings, the same as a chord that would be obtained on the
instrument to be imitated;
elements (7,19), equal in number to the strings of the
instrument to be imitated, which are suitable to

sequentially undergo a change in state caused by the hand of
a user (12) who performs a movement that is identical to the

one made to obtain the sound of the instrument to be
imitated, and are suitable to send, as a consequence of said

change, a signal to said microprocessor to transmit said
chord to a sound card by means of a standardized signal,

each of said elements (7,19) being provided with a device
(10,11) for its elastic return to an unchanged state,

characterized in that the device for the elastic return of
each bar to the non-deformed position comprises portions

(10) of elastic material in contact with hammer-shaped
portions (11) located at the end of said elements (7) which

is arranged between a transmitting element (8a) and a
receiving element (8b) of an optical sensor.
The device according to claim 1, characterized in
that said microprocessor and said elements (7,19) are

combined in a single structure (1) suitable to be carried in
a suitable position by the user (12). 
The device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that each one of the elements (7)

that are equal in number to the strings of the instrument to
be imitated comprises a bar (7) which is fixed at one end

and is placed, at its other end, in the field of the optical
sensor (8) which is connected to the microprocessor, between

the part (8a) that transmits a beam and the part (8b) that
receives it, so as to affect said beam in the non-deformed

position, and so as to allow said beam to pass as a
consequence of the elastic deformation undergone due to the

action of the user's hand, all of said bars (7) being
arranged parallel to each other and lying on the same plane.
The device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that each one of the

elements (7) that are equal in number to the strings of the
instrument to be imitated comprises a bar (7) which is made

of a material that is sensitive to a magnetic field and is
inserted between magnetic field generators which are

connected to the microprocessor, all of said bars (7) being
parallel to each other and lying in a single plane.
The device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that each one of the elements that

are equal in number to the strings of the instrument to be
imitated comprises a bar (7) that is suitable to produce an

electrostatic field together with an adjacent bar, all of
said bars being connected to the microprocessor, being

parallel to each other, and lying on a single plane.
