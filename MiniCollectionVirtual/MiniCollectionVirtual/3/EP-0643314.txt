<ABSTRACT>
An image display apparatus reduces the possibility of occurrence of minor 
discomforts such as headaches, eyestrain, fatigue and the like in users. A symbol 

indicating distance such as 1m, 3m, or âˆž is displayed on an outer periphery of a 
virtual image adjusting knob. When the user aligns a mark on the virtual image 

position adjusting knob (18) 
with a position corresponding to one of the predetermined 

symbols, the virtual image is set so as to be displayed at a position corresponding to 
the symbol. Consequently, the user can more easily recognize the displayed position 

of the virtual image so that the generation of a minor discomfort due to long term use 
which is more than necessary of the image display apparatus is substantially reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image display apparatus.Game devices which provide virtual reality images are becoming increasingly
popular. Typically, such devices enable a user to view a three-dimensional image on
a display while playing a game. This provides a realistic effect which enhances
enjoyment of playing the game.In such devices, an eyeglass type display apparatus is utilized to display the
three-dimensional image. Typically, the display apparatus is worn on a user's head
and positioned in front of the user's eyes so as to enable viewing by the user.
However, some users may develop headaches, eyestrain, fatigue or other minor
discomforts if the display apparatus is used for a relatively long period of time.European Patent Application Publication No. EP-A-0 551 781 discloses a
goggle type image display apparatus comprising left and right optical blocks each
having display means for representing an image thereof. Each optical block
comprises a liquid crystal display (LCD), a back light for illuminating the image on
the LCD, an eye lens on which the illuminated image is made incident via a prism,
and a lens support arrangement for supporting the eye lens to provide a variable focal
distance. Each lens support arrangement includes a visibility adjusting dial which,
when rotated, rotates a cylindrical lens bracket which causes the associated eye lens
to move forward or rearward.According to the present invention there is provided an image display
apparatus comprising:
image display means for displaying an image;optical means for optically generating a virtual image of the image displayed
by said image display means and focusing the virtual image on an eye of a user;adjusting means for adjusting a position of said virtual image; andmeans for displaying the position of said virtual image on said image display
means.Preferred embodiments of the invention described hereinbelow provide an
image display apparatus which substantially reduces or eliminates the occurrence of
the above-mentioned minor discomforts. The preferred embodiments provide an 
eyeglass type image display apparatus which substantially reduces or eliminates the
occurrence of minor discomforts such as headaches, eyestrain and the like.The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non-limiting
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of an image display
apparatus according to the invention;Fig. 2 is a perspective view representing a detailed

<CLAIMS>
An image display apparatus comprising:

image display means (12) for displaying an image;
optical means (13, 14) for optically generating a virtual image of the
image displayed by said image display means (12) and focusing the virtual image on

an eye of a user; and
adjusting means (18 etc) for adjusting a position of said virtual image;
characterised by :
means for displaying the position of said virtual image on said image
display means (12).
An image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the position
of said virtual image is displayed on said image display means (12) by means of

symbols.
An image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the position
of said virtual image is displayed on said image display means (12) as a magnitude

of an image screen corresponding to said virtual image.
An image display apparatus according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3,
comprising information means for informing a user in speech form of a change in

said virtual image position when said position is adjusted by said adjusting means (18
etc).
An image display apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
comprising means responsive to operation of said adjusting means (18 etc) to start a

timer if such operation results in the convergence angle (B) of the image display
means (12) to said virtual image becoming greater than a reference angle and to

reduce the convergence angle to less than the reference angle when the timer indicates
that a predetermined time interval has expired. 
An image display apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
comprising means responsive to operation of said adjusting means (18 etc) to start a

timer if such operation results in the convergence angle (B) of the image display
means (12) to said virtual image becoming greater than a reference angle and to stop

power being supplied to the image display means (12) when the timer indicates that
a predetermined time interval has expired.
An image display apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the adjusting means (18 etc) is operative to change the convergence

angle (B) of the image display means (12) to said virtual image as the position of said
virtual image is changed.
