<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a one-part, room temperature
moisture curable resin composition which comprises a ketimine

prepared by reacting a ketone having a substituent at α position
and a polyamine having at least two amino groups within its

molecule wherein α position is methylene, and a main polymer which
is an epoxy resin and/or a modified silicone having at least two

hydrolyzable alkoxysilyl groups in its molecule, and which
exhibits good shelf stability and high curing rate once taken

out of the container, and which may further exhibit flexibility;
a one-part, room temperature moisture curable resin composition

which exhibits good shelf stability and curability as well as
wet surface adhesion or initial thixotropic properties; a silicon

containing compound having ketimine group whose reaction with
the epoxy resin during the storage is prevented by the presence

of a bulky alkyl group near the ketimine group and which exhibits
good shelf stability and curability, and its production method;

a one-part, room temperature moisture curable resin composition
containing said silicon containing compound adapted as a latent

curing agent which exhibits good shelf stability and short curing
period once taken out of the container; and a novel method of

ketimine synthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a one-part, room temperature
moisture curable resin composition adapted for use as an adhesive
or a sealant in the field of civil engineering and architecture
which exhibits good shelf stability and fast curing rate once
taken out of the container, and which may further exhibit
flexibility; and a one-part, room temperature moisture curable resin
composition which exhibits good shelf stability and curability
as well as wet surface adhesion or initial thixotropic properties.Epoxy resins have been widely used as adhesives, sealants
and coating compositions in the fields of civil engineering, 
architecture, electronic equipment and the like in view of their
favorable properties including the excellent adhesion and
strength.Epoxy resins are highly reactive, and when an epoxy resin
is mixed with an amine component, it easily reacts with the amine
component to cure. Therefore, most epoxy resins have been used
in two-part form.Under such situation, various attempts have been made to
develop one-part resin compositions by using a ketimine compound
or the like as a latent curing agent. However, no system have
been so far been developed that exhibits well balanced shelf
stability and curability.For example, JP-A 5-132541 discloses a technique wherein
reactivity during the storage is reduced by using a long chain
polyoxylene for the skeleton of the ketimine compound to thereby
improve shelf stability. This resin, however, slowly cures when
it is taken out of the container and is not a one-part epoxy resin
composition of practical level.In addition, the resin compositions comprising an epoxy
resin and a ketimine compound also suffer from the drawback of
poor flexibility of the cured product.On the other hand, organosilicon compounds having ketimine
structure are known, and various process of their synthesis and
various techniques of their use as a tackifier or a curing agent
to be blended in the resin composition are also known. Number
of the ketimine group in the molecule of such known compounds
are one or two, and in most cases one. The ketimine compound are synthesized, for example, by a
process wherein an alkoxysilane having amino group is reacted
with a ketone in the presence of anhydrous sulfate or a molecular
sieve (see JP-A 3-263421 and JP-A 7-247295), a process wherein
an alkoxysilane having amino group is gradually introduced into
a ketone by heating (see JP-A 7-247294), or a process wherein
an organic unsaturated compound having ketimine group is reacted
with hydroalkoxysilane in
