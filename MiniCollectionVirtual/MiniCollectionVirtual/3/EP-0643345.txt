<ABSTRACT>
In order to ensure trouble-free operation of a technical plant having a multiplicity of mutually dependent plant processes, that is to say with a high complexity, a method and a data processing system are proposed in which the operating states of the technical plant are monitored by means of measured values (MW) characterising the operating states of the technical plant and by means of stored technological knowledge (TW) relevant to the operation of the plant. In detail, in this arrangement, the measured values (MW) are converted into plant symptoms (S) specific to the associated operating conditions, using the technological knowledge (TW), these plant symptoms (S) are assigned importance values using the technological knowledge (TW) and a diagnosis (D) of the operating condition of the plant is constructed from one or more symptoms (S) as a function of the respectively associated importance value. As an alternative, the associated diagnosis (D) can initially be derived from one or more plant symptoms (S), this diagnosis (D) can be assigned an importance value and the diagnosis (D) can be output on a user interface (74) as a function of its importance value. Such a monitoring device ensures a high operational reliability and high plant availability with simultaneously especially high data compression, as a result of which the operating personnel of the technical plant are considerably relieved of load. The method and the data processing system can be used in complex technical plants of any type for monitoring, diagnosis and management.

A data processing system (2) for monitoring operating
states (16) of a technical plant by means of measured

values (MW) characterising the operating states (16) and by
means of stored technical knowledge (TW) relevant to the

operation of the plant, characterised by

a) a measuring plane (4) with means (36 to 44) for the
acquisition of the measured values (MW) characterising

the operating states of the technical plant, or a
simulation plane (100) with a data memory for measured

values (MW) characterising the operating states of the
technical plant,
b) a coupling plane (6) with means (46) for the
preparation of the measured values (MW) with the

addition of a measuring-point-specific code,
c) an administration plane (8) with a code-addressing
module (48),
d) an action plane (10) with an action module (50, 64,
66) for determining plant symptoms (S) and/or

diagnoses (D) and their associated significance values
with the execution of logic and/or arithmetic

operations,
e) a data plane (12) with at least one data memory (52 to
58) for the storage of measured-value-specific rules

(SR), confidence rules (KR), confidence thresholds
(KS), plant symptoms (S), diagnoses (D) and measured

values (MW) and
f) a display plane (14) with a user surface (74).
