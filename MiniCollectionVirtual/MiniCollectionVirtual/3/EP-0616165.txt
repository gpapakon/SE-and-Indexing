<ABSTRACT>
A pipe coupling is constructed such that: a pressing 
member (9) is supported by an inner collar (8) and presses an 

inserted pipe body (14) in a state in which the pressing member 
contacts an inclined surface of an outer collar (10); the 

inclined surface of the outer collar causes the pressing 
member to be moved in a radial direction thereof when the 

pressing member moves toward a deep portion within the pipe 
coupling, and restricts the movement of the pressing member 

in the radial direction when the pressing member moves in a 
direction of an exit; and the inner collar (8) is urged toward 

the exit by an elastic member. In the case of any type of 
rigid pipe body, the pipe coupling can be freely and easily 

connected to and removed from the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe coupling for 
use in a pipe arrangement of a construction machine, a 
machine tool and the like, and particularly to a pipe 
coupling which is suitable for use in connecting and 
removing a pipe body in a small space where it is difficult 
to use a tool. For use with a pipe body which is made of relatively 
flexible synthetic resin or rubber, there has been proposed 
a pipe coupling which makes it possible to connect and 
remove a pipe body in a relatively simple manner. However, when used with a relatively hard pipe body 
such as a polyvinyl chloride-coated hose, which is also made 
of synthetic resin as described above, or a metal pipe or 
the like, a pipe coupling which can be freely connected to 
and removed from such a hard pipe, has not been put to 
practical use. Fig. 9 shows one example of this type of pipe coupling, 
which allows coupling by causing a bite piece 32 to bite a 
pipe body 40.  A cap nut 33 threadedly engaged with a female member 31 
causes the bite piece 32 to be pressed against and to bite a 
surface of the pipe body 40. Thus, even if the cap nut 33 
is loosened, the bite piece 32 is not easily separated from 
the pipe body 40, making it nearly impossible to remove the 
pipe body 40 from the pipe coupling. Further, if the pipe 
body 40 is removed from the pipe coupling, the surface of 
the pipe body 40 is damaged. For this reason, when the 
damaged pipe body 40 is re-used, there is a possibility that 
the fluid flowing through the pipe body 40 may leak out via 
the damaged portion thereof. Therefore, a pipe coupling which is suitable for use 
with a metal pipe or the like and which can be freely 
connected to and removed from the metal pipe or the like, is 
not in practical use. In view of the aforementioned, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a pipe coupling for use with a 
pipe having a relatively high rigidity, such as a metal 
pipe, in which the pipe coupling can be connected to and 
removed from this kind of pipe in a simple manner. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a pipe coupling comprising: a cylindrical female 
member; an outer collar which is cylindrical and which is  
 
formed so as to be continuous with the female member, and 
which has an inclined surface at an inner peripheral surface 
thereof, the inclined surface being formed such that a 
diameter thereof at the side of a deep portion within the 
female member is large; an inner collar which is cylindrical 
and which is provided

provided so as to move within said outer collar in an axial 

direction of said outer collar; 
   a pressing member supported by said inner collar so as 

to press an inserted pipe body; 
   movement-restricting means which generates a pressing 

force of said pressing member and restricts the movement of 
said inner collar; and 

   an elastic member provided within any one of said 
female member and said outer collar and urging said inner 

collar toward an exit. 
A pipe coupling according to claim 1, wherein said 
movement-restricting means is formed by an inclined surface 

which is formed at an inner peripheral surface of said outer 
collar such that a diameter of said inclined surface at the 

side of a deep portion within said female member is large, 
and which causes said pressing member to generate a pressing 

force by said pressing member abutting said inclined 
 

surface. 
A pipe coupling according to claim 1, wherein said 
elastic member and said inner collar are sequentially 

arranged from the side of the deep portion within said 
female member.
