<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus of scanning near-field optic/atomic force 
microscope capable of measuring the surface topography and 

optical characteristics of a sample at high resolution, 
irrespective of whether the sample transmits light or whether 

it is conductive. A laser, a condenser lens, and a 
photoelectric converter device are installed above a 

cantilever having a probe. Laser light from the laser is 
focused onto the back surface of the cantilever by the 

condenser lens, and the reflected light is introduced into 
the photoelectric converter device. Light emanating from a 

light source for measurement of optical information is 

directed to a sample from its back surface via a collimator 
lens, the sample being placed on a prism. The light is 

introduced into the front end of the probe close to the 
sample, and introduced into the photoelectric converter 

device via the light-transmitting device. The operation of 
the whole apparatus is controlled by a computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning near-field optic/atomic force
microscope for observing the topography of a substance to be investigated, by
making use of an atomic force acting between substances, and the same time
for observing the optical property of microscopic region of the investigated
substance by a probe consisting of a light-propagating body according to the
preamble of independent claim 1.Such scanning near-field optic/atomic force microscopes are for example known
from APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS, vol. 60, no. 24, 15 June 1992, NEW
YORK US pages 2957 - 2959 R. TOLEDO-CROW et al "near-field differential
scanning optical microscope with atomic force regulation" and
SPIE SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPIES, vol. 1639, 20 January 1992, LOS
ANGELES, USA, pages 36-43, N.R. VAN HULST et. al. "operation of a
scanning near field optical microscope in combination with a scanning force
microscope", respectively.In order to elucidate the scope of the present invention, the following passages
give an overview about atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling
microscopes.Atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are capable of accurately observing the
topography of the surface of a sample, irrespective of whether the sample is
conductive or not, in contrast with scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs)
and, therefore, AFMs are widespread. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a
measuring method utilizing the fact that a spring element supporting a
measuring probe is deflected by an atomic force acting between a sample and
the measuring probe. In an attempt to measure the optical characteristics and the topography of a
sample, a probe consisting of a light propagating medium having a sharp front end was
brought close to the sample to be investigated such that the distance between
them was less than the wavelength of the light. Also, some near-field optical
microscopes have been proposed. In one of 
these instruments, laser light is directed from the rear side
of a sample such that the light is totally reflected by the
rear surface of the sample. Evanescent light leaking from
the front surface of the sample is detected by bringing the
front end of an optical fiber probe close to the surface of
the sample, the probe being equipped with a fine-motion
mechanism. Variations in the intensity of the evanescent
light are measured by scanning the probe so as to detect
predetermined evanescent light or by scanning the probe
horizontally so as to detect the absolute value of the
evanescent light. In this way, the topography of the
