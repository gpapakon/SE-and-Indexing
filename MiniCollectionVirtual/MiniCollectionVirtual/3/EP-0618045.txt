<ABSTRACT>
This wrench comprises a strap (2), particularly a metal one, the two ends of which are fixed to a threaded rod (3), a supporting body (1), and a tapped handle (4) into which is screwed the threaded rod which is mounted so that it can rotate on the supporting body. The supporting body (1) is constituted by a single-piece component equipped with a central passage (11) through which the threaded rod passes and the bearing face (5) of which is cylindrical and of axis perpendicular to the axis of the handle. Application to wrenches for taking oil or petrol filters off motor vehicles.

A strap wrench of the type comprising a strap (2), notably metallic,
of which the two extremities are fixed to a threaded stem (3), a support

body (1), and a bored handle (4) into which the threaded stem screws
itself and which is rotably mounted on the support body, the support body

(1), being made up of a one-piece casting furnished with a central passage
(11) for the strap, characterised in that the support face (5) of the said

body opposed to the handle is cylindrical with an axis perpendicular to the
axis (X-X) of the handle, in that the central passage (11) is adapted to

guide the threaded stem (3) and is bordered by two profiled cavities (12),
diametrically opposed, for lateral guidance and support of the strap, and

in that the two cavities emerge in the central passage and the support face,
which extends on the angular section provided between the cavities.
A strap wrench according to claim 1, characterised in that the body
(1) and the handle (4) include means of reciprocal jointing on a slender

portion of the length of the handle, and means (31, 31A) for reciprocally
axially retaining these two pieces in the jointed position.
A strap wrench according to claim 2, characterised in that the
means of axial retention comprise at least one ball (31) held by a spring,

disposed in a radial bore in one of the two pieces (1, 4), and a circular
gorge (10) provided in the other of these two pieces.
A strap wrench according to claim 1, characterised in that the
handle and the proximal part of the body ar
e essentially cylindrical and of
the same diameter, disposed end to end without penetration, coaxial and

centred by the threaded stem. 
A strap wrench according to claim 4, characterised in that the
handle and the body are in rotating plane contact and are provided with

grooves on their extremity permitting the mounting of a circular ring of
U-section maintaining the planar contact.
A strap wrench according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the body (1) includes a transveral abutment (15) originating from

material, parallel to the axis of the support face (5).
A strap wrench according to claim 6, characterised in that the
forward face of the abutment (15) is level with the support face (5) of the

body (1).
A strap wrench according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the body (1) includes on one side and the other of passage (11),

parallel to the axis of the support face (5), aligned transversal bores (15A)
destined to receive a part of the related abutment, notably a screw (15B)

or a split pin (15C).
A strap wrench according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that the threaded stem (3) comprises a distal extension of reduced

thickness on one side and the other of which are fixed the two extremities
of the strap (2).
A strap wrench according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised
in that the handle (4) presents a shapely contour with a convex principal

part (29) prolonged at each end by a concave extremity (28, 30).
