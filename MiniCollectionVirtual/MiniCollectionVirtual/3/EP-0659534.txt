<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sequentially extruded coolant hose consisting of a number of polymer layers with great hydrolysis and bursting pressure resistance for engines, in particular vehicle engines. It has been established that, surprisingly, multilayer hoses with a combination of differently active layers made of suitable polymers, e.g. with a non-swellable inner layer which is inert for coolant and a rigid supporting, especially bursting-pressure resistant outer layer, are particularly suitable. These layers must be mutually compatible or connected by an intermediate layer which is compatible with the two layers. Such hoses according to the invention have preferably been provided in a known manner with a corrugation of their multilayer wall after sequential coextrusion of their layers made from the various polymers.

Coolant hose (1), comprising a plurality of layers formed from
thermoplastically processable polymers, which hose has an annularly or a

helically undulatory wall (8) on at least one portion (7) and comprises at
least one inner non-swellable layer (2), which is inert relative to the

cooling agent and comprises halogenated or non-halogenated homo- or
copolyolefines or mixtures or blends thereof, and one outer burst-proof

layer (4; 5), which comprises a homo- or copolyamide or mixtures or
blends thereof, either the inner layer (2) being provided with

compatible-rendering groups, which are reactive by grafting with α-unsaturated
acids or respectively derivatives thereof or by

copolymerisation with acrylic or methacrylic acids, or an intermediate
layer (3), which is compatible with these two layers, being disposed

between the inner and outer layers, said intermediate layer comprising
polyolefine or copolyolefine, which has groups capable of reaction by

grafting α-unsaturated acids or respectively derivatives thereof or by
copolymerisation with acrylic or methacrylic acids, characterised in that

the coolant hose (1) is produced by sequential co-extrusion, and
individual layers comprise various polymers in sections.
Coolant hose according to claim 1, characterised in that the homo- or
copolyamides of the outer layer (4; 5) comprise linear aliphatic

monomers having 6 to 12 C atoms, aromatic monomers having 6 to 12 C
atoms or cycloaliphatic monomers having 6 to 20 C atoms. 
Coolant hose according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
polyamides of the various sections of the outer layer (4; 5) may be

reinforced with glass fibres.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the outer layer (4; 5) comprises polyamide-6, and

the inner layer (2) comprises a polyolefine or copolyolefine having α-unsaturated
dicarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof grafted thereon.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the inner layer comprises halogenated or non-halogenated homo- or

copolyolefines, or mixtures or blends thereof, which are not compatible
with the outer layer.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the inner layer (2) comprises chlorinated or

fluorinated homo- or copolyolefines or PVC or blends or polymers of the
inner and outer layers.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the inner layer (2) comprises polymers of the ETFE,

PTFE, PVDF, PPS, PPE, POM, EVOH, EVA, PBT group and blends
thereof.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the wall thickness of the outer burst-proof layer (4;

5) is between 10 % and 95 %, preferably between 25 % and 95 %, of the
total wall thickness. 
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises an inner layer (2), which is formed from

maleic acid-grafted polyolefine or copolyolefine, and an outer layer (4;
5), which has highly viscous polyamide-6 or polyamide-12 in the smooth

pan (6) and comprises a copolymer or blend of these polyamide types,
which is modified in respect of its flexibility, in the outer layer of the

undulatory pan (7).
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises an inner layer (2), which is formed from

polyolefine, copolyolefine or a polyolefinic blend, and an outer layer (4;
5), which has highly viscous polyamide-12 in the smooth, rigid part (6)

and comprises polyamide-12 elastomer in the flexible, undulatory part
(7) of the outer layer.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises an inner layer (2), which is formed from

polyolefine, copolyolefine or a polyolefinic blend, and an outer layer (4;
5), which has glass fibre-reinforced polyamide-12 in the non-undulatory,

rigid region (6) and comprises polyamide-12 in the flexible, undulatory
region (7) of the outer layer.
