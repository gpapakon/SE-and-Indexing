<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of operating 
an internal combustion engine burning a fuel, such as 
petrol, diesel fuel or alcohol, containing carbon and 
hydrogen. As is known, an exhaust catalytic converter only 
performs its task of reducing the unburnt hydrocarbons, 
carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen content of the 
exhaust gases after it has reached a critical temperature, 
termed the light-off temperature, which is between 300°C and 
400°C. In the case of an internal combustion engine in which 
very lean mixtures are burnt under light load conditions, 
the excess air tends to cool the catalytic converter making 
it difficult for the latter to remain above the light-off 
temperature under certain conditions, notably during idling. 
To some extent, this problem can be counteracted by placing 
the converter nearer to the engine (close coupling) but the 
converter may then not be able to withstand the temperature 
at full load. Ideally therefore, the converter should be 
kept sufficiently far away from the engine to allow safe 
full load operation, but means should be provided for 
heating the catalyst when it risks dropping below its light-off 
temperature. Diesel engines tend to produce soot in their exhaust 
gases and are required to have a filter trap in order to 
meet regulations for reducing toxic emissions from engines. 
Such filter traps tend to be blocked by the soot particles 
after some time and various proposals have been made for 
regenerating the filter trap. One way is to burn off the 
soot and it is known that if burning is started by an 
external heat source at the front face of the filter trap,  
 
the exothermic reaction will itself spread along the length 
of the trap in a manner similar to the burning of a 
cigarette when air is drawn through it. Thus, in both diesel and petrol engines, it is 
desirable to be able at certain times to generate heat 
within the exhaust system and the present invention seeks to 
provide a method of operating the engine to create such a 
heat source under selected conditions. The present invention provides a method of operating an 
internal combustion engine burning a fuel, such as petrol, 
diesel fuel or alcohol, containing carbon and hydrogen, 
which method comprises the steps of determining when the 
engine is operating in a deceleration mode, reducing the 
throttle opening of the air intake to the engine only during 
deceleration modes below the throttle opening for steady 
speed idling to reduce the mass of air in each combustion

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating an internal combustion 
engine burning a fuel, such as petrol, diesel fuel or 

alcohol, containing carbon and hydrogen, which method 
comprises the steps of : 


a) determining when the engine is operating in a 
deceleration mode, 
b) reducing the throttle opening of the air intake 
to the engine only during deceleration modes below the 

throttle opening for steady speed idling to reduce the 
mass of air in each combustion charge when the engine 

is overrunning while continuing to admit fuel into the 
combustion chamber to result in excessively rich 

combustion in at least a region of the combustion 
charge and thereby create a proportion of combustible 

gases in the exhaust gas stream, 
c) ensuring the presence in the exhaust gas stream 
of additional air from an external source or unused air 

from the engine to mix with the combustible gases to 
achieve during deceleration modes an exhaust mixture 

having sufficiently high concentrations of combustible 
gases and oxygen to be ignitable, and 
d) igniting the mixture to burn as a flame within 
an afterburner chamber arranged upstream of an element 

of the exhaust system, such as a catalytic converter or 
a filter trap, in order to heat the element during 

deceleration modes. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step 
of determining when the engine is in deceleration mode 

comprises comparing the manifold depression with a reference 
value determined by reference to the current engine speed.  

 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
step of reducing the throttle opening below the steady speed 

idle position comprises moving a butterfly plate of a 
butterfly valve to a position which obstructs the air flow 

more than its normal position during steady idling. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
step of reducing the throttle opening below the steady speed 

idle position comprises at least partially closing a passage 
provided to by-pass a butterfly throttle valve. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in 
which the step of ensuring the presence in the exhaust gas 

stream of additional air comprises directing air from a 
compressor to the exhaust system during deceleration modes. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the step of ensuring the presence in the exhaust gas 

stream of additional air comprises diverting air to the 
exhaust system from a turbocharger pressurising the intake 

system. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the step of ensuring the presence in the exhaust gas 

stream of additional air comprises introducing ram air into 
the exhaust system from an air scoop generating a positive 

air pressure from vehicle movement. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the step of ensuring the presence in the exhaust gas 

stream of additional air comprises cutting off the fuel 
supply to some engine cylinders while supplying other 

cylinders with an excessively rich mixture. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the step of igniting the mixture comprises 

generating sparks within the afterburner chamber.
