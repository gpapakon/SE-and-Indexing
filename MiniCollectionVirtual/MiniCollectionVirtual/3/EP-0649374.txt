<ABSTRACT>
A driographic printing plate precursor comprises a base substrate, an infrared radiation ablatable ink repellant coating on the substrate, and a transparent cover sheet on the coating. An image is formed on the plate by sequentially exposing areas of the coating to a laser beam to ablate the coating in those areas. The cover sheet and ablation products are then removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the formation of images 
directly from electronically composed digital sources 
and is concerned with the formation of images in this 
way in dry planography in which there is used a 
planographic printing plate having background or non-image 
surface areas which, although not moistened by 
water or other liquid, will not accept ink. For many years it has been a long term aim in the 
printing industry to form images directly from an 
electronically composed digital database, i.e. by a so-called 
"computer-to-plate" system. The advantages of 
such a system over the traditional methods of making 
printing plates are: 
(i) the elimination of costly intermediate 
silver film and processing chemicals, (ii) a saving of time, and (iii) the ability to automate the system with 
consequent reduction in labour costs. The introduction of laser technology provided the 
first opportunity to form an image directly on a 
printing plate precursor by scanning a laser beam 
across the surface of the precursor and modulating the 
beam so as to effectively turn it on and off. In this 
way, radiation sensitive plates comprising a high 
sensitivity polymer coating have been exposed to laser 
beams produced by water cooled UV argon-ion lasers and 
electrophotographic plates having sensitivities 
stretching into the visible spectral region have been 
successfully exposed using low-powered air-cooled 
argon-ion, helium-neon and semiconductor laser devices. Imaging systems are also available which involve a 
sandwich structure which, on exposure to a heat 
generating infra-red laser beam, undergoes selective 
(imagewise) delamination and subsequent transfer of 
materials. Such so-called peel-apart systems are  
 
generally used as replacements for silver halide films. It is also known to overcome difficulties inherent 
with conventional lithography - the best known form of 
planography - via the use of planographic printing 
plates which do not require a dampening of the printing 
plate with an aqueous fountain solution to effectively 
wet the non-image areas. Such so-called "driographic" 
plates are typically derived from radiation sensitive 
plates comprising a substrate coated with a 
photosensitive layer, said layer being overlaid with a 
coating of a low surface energy material, which is 
repellant to printing ink. Alternatively, the ink-repellant 
layer may be applied directly to the 
substrate, with the photosensitive layer being coated 
over the ink-repellant layer. As a further 
alternative, a
