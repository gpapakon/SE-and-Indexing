<ABSTRACT>
In a code setting circuit wherein pad terminals are supplied with a 
voltage pulse to burn out corresponding thin-film resistors, first transistors 

of first conductivity type are adapted to be turned on in response to a 
turn-on pulse and second transistors of the first conductivity type are 

provided. The channel of each second transistor is connected in parallel 
with the channel of each first transistor between a voltage source and one 

of circuit nodes at which desired potentials are developed and a digital 
setting signal is generated corresponding thereto. Inverters are 

connected between the nodes and the gate terminals of the second 
transistors to keep the nodes at the desired potentials. Third transistors of 

second conductivity type are provided to prevent the voltage source 
from being coupled through the second transistors to the pad terminals. 

Blocking means are provided respectively corresponding to the third 
transistors and the pad terminals. Each blocking means is connected 

between the other end of the channel of the corresponding third 
transistor and the corresponding pad terminal for preventing a noise 

pulse generated when the voltage pulse is applied to the corresponding 
pad terminal from being applied to the corresponding third transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a code setting circuit for
generating a digital signal which is used by an external
circuit for setting a reference value or the like.A code setting circuit as disclosed in Japanese Provisional
Patent Publication 4-150050 includes a plurality of thin-film
resistors which are selectively burned out by the application
of a voltage pulse through respective pad terminals to produce
a set of high and low potentials. By using these potentials, a
decoder generates a digital setting signal. However, when the
voltage pulse is applied to a pad terminal, there is a sharp
increase in the impedance of the pad terminal and a noise
pulse is generated. Due to this noise pulse, a MOS transistor
connected to the pad terminal is destroyed, failing to burn
out a desired thin-film resistorFrom EP-A1-480 475 whereon the preamble of the claim is based
it is known to provide a code setting
circuit capable of an increased rising speed of a fusing-off
pulse applied to a pad connected to a thin film resistor.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
a code setting circuit that is tolerant of a high noise
voltage pulse generated when a voltage pulse is applied to any
of the pad terminals. According to the present invention, 
there is provided a code setting circuit comprising a
plurality of pad terminals to each of which a voltage pulse is
applied, and a plurality of thin-film resistors corresponding
respectively to the pad terminals. Each of the thin-film
resistors is connected between the corresponding pad terminal
and a reference potential, or ground. A plurality of first
transistors of first conductivity type are adapted to be
rendered conductive in response to a turn-on pulse. A
plurality of second transistors of the first conductivity type
corresponding to the first transistors are provided, each of
the 
second transistors having a channel connected in parallel with a channel
of the corresponding first transistor between a voltage source and a
corresponding one of a plurality of nodes. A plurality of inverters are
provided corresponding respectively to the second transistors and the
nodes. Each of the inverters is connected between the corresponding
node and the gate terminal of the corresponding second transistor. A
plurality of third transistors of second conductivity type opposite to the
first conductivity type are provided corresponding respectively to the
nodes. Each of the third transistors has a channel connected at one end
to the corresponding node and a gate
