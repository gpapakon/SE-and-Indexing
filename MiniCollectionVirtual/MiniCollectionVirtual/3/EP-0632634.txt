<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a module for 
permitting the test of a digital telephone exchange receiving at 
its input and outputting TDM digital signals, in particular 
multiple PCM signals. It is well known that telephone exchanges need various tests both 
during the production of single modules composing them and during 
assembling and set up as well as during their normal operation. A 
lot of tests have to be carried out. The present invention particularly relates to the following 
tests: call simulation; protocol analysis; transmission; 
reception and level measurement of single and multiple tones; 
noise measurements; line-error-rate and bit-error-rate 
measurements; service calls; discreet listening. Such tests are 
usually carried out through the use of so-called test desks 
connected to the telephone exchange. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and 
a relative circuit which allow the testing of a digital telephone 
exchange without limitation as to the number of test desks, as to 
the type of test to be realized and as to the type of information 
(speech, video, data, ...) handled by the exchange. These 
requirements are very important to achieve because of the very 
fast evolution in the field of telecommunication as to both used 
techniques and services offered.  This object is reached through the method as set forth in claim 
1, through the module as set forth in claim 9 and through the 
telephone exchange as set forth in claim 14. Further advantageous 
aspects of the present invention are set forth in the subclaims. Through the use of a queue handler, more advantageously 
a programmable one, as an interface between at least one test 
desk and one digital telephone exchange receiving at its input 
and outputting TDM digital signals, the possibility of carrying 
out tests with high flexibility is obtained. The present invention will become more apparent from the 
following description taken in conjunction with the attached 
drawings wherein: 
Fig. 1is a block diagram of a module in accordance with the 
present invention connected to some test desks and to a 
telephone exchange, and Fig. 2is a more detailed block diagram of an interface to test 
desks comprised in the module of Fig. 1.  
In describing the method according to the present invention, 
reference is made to Fig. 1 where CD indicates a digital 
telephone exchange. DSN indicates its digital switching network, 
MOD indicates a module in accordance with the present invention 
and TD, without
