<ABSTRACT>
Respective unit displays (50) forming a multiscreen 
display are divided into two halves of a front half cabinet 

(51) containing a screen part (52) and a rear half cabinet 
(56) containing a light box part (57). In using, the rear 

half cabinet is fixed in a predetermined position in the 
front half cabinet. In conveying and storing, the rear half 

cabinet can be contained in the front half cabinet. Further, 
in fitting the screen, the screen is fixed as pressed against 

the fitting frame by using wires or the Fresnel lenses 
forming the screen are fitted to the fitting frames for the 

respective projecting units.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wide-screened
multiscreen display made by heaping a plurality of unit
displays (called also cube projection displays) in
vertical and horizontal directions and a process for
assembling the same so that particularly the operations
of conveying and heaping the cabinets of respective unit
displays, the operations of the adjustment and
maintenance after heaping the cabinets may be efficient,
the space efficiency in conveying and storing the
cabinets may be improved and the width of the boundary
(joint width) between the screens of the respective unit
displays may be made small.GB-A-2 248 005 discloses a multi screen display having a
plurality of unit displays. In particular, a method is
described how the individual unit displays can be assembled
and easily mounted into one frame unit.AT-A-329 295 describes a light box part having a light
emitting region which is to be attached to a screen part at
side portions thereof, such that the light is emitted into
an opening to be displayed on the screen after having been
reflected by a mirror. The screen part itself comprises a
movable screen which in transport conditions is not
projected. When assembled the screen is displaced against
the action of a spring and after mounting it is locked by a
locking means. Two assembly conditions are shown.Conventional multiscreen displays are of a
front surface projecting type wherein an image light from
a projecting unit is projected from the front surface of
the screen and a back surface projecting type wherein an
image light is projected from the back surface of the
screen. However, the back surface type multiscreen
display which is low in the influence of the surrounding
light is generally prevalent. In such back surface type  
multiscreen display, the screen is divided vertically and
horizontally to set a plurality of zones so that image
lights from a plurality of projecting units may be
projected onto the respective plurality of zones,
individual plurality of images may be thereby displayed
and one image may be displayed as divided into a
plurality of images.The conventional multiscreen display can be
formed to obtain a screen of a large picture by arranging a
plurality of (9 in the drawing) unit displays 1 in the
vertical and horizontal directions as shown in Fig. 15.Fig. 16 shows an appearance view of an example
of the unit display. Fig. 17 shows a vertically sectioned
view of the same.As shown in these figures, the unit display 1
has a screen fitting frame 4 arranged on the front
surface of a

connecting parts (55) and (67) and are formed to be
connectable with each other by a locking means (69).
A multiscreen display according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that a plurality of shafts (83) movable
forward and rearward are inserted through the cabinet of

said first part (51), said shaft (83) being provided at
one end with a means (82) for regulating the rearward 

movement and is passed and fixed at the other end through
the cabinet of said second part (56) and, with the

movement of said shaft (83), said second part (56) is
formed to be movable and containable inside said first

part (51).
A multiscreen display according to claim 3,

characterized by comprising:

a guide means (86) of a fixed length shorter than the
length of said shaft (83) removably secured in the rear

end part to the rear end of said second part (56) to fix
