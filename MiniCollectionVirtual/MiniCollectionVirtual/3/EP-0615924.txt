<ABSTRACT>
The cap particularly for spray cans comprises a body 
(10) having a cylindrical skirt (11) which is connected to 

an end wall (12) at an axial end and has, at its other 
axial end, means (13) for snap-together coupling to a spray 

can. The particularity of the cap resides in the fact that 
it comprises, on the cylindrical skirt, recesses (20) which 

extend axially and affect at least the perimetric region of 
the end wall of the cap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cap particularly 
for spray cans. As it is known, substantially cylindrical caps applied 
in a snap-together manner in order to close dispenser cans, 
commonly termed spray cans, have long been in widespread 
use. These caps are substantially constituted by a body 
with a cylindrical skirt which is closed by an end wall at 
its upper end and has, at its other end, elements which 
protrude proximate to the inner edge and allow coupling to 
the spray can collar. These caps must be sized so as to withstand the 
stacking of multiple cans, during storage and packaging, 
and until recently they were produced using a relatively 
thick layer of plastic material. The current trend is to reduce the amount of plastic 
material being used, so that the thickness of the walls of 
the cap-like body has been reduced significantly; 
furthermore, in order to withstand the axial load sustained 
during packaging and storage, as shown in figures 1 and 2, 
ridges 1 are provided on the inner surface of the 
cylindrical skirt 2. The ridges 1 extend axially inside the 
cap and end at the end wall of said cap. The ridges have, in transverse cross-section, a 
rectangular shape with a limited protrusion in a radial 
direction. This solution allows to withstand the axial pressure 
bearing on the cap mounted on the can, but does not allow 
to keep a stable shape for the cap.  According to current production steps, the caps are in 
practice placed directly in the packaging cartons 
immediately after leaving the molding machine, so that the 
cap, which has not yet cooled completely, is often subject 
to deformations in a radial direction due to the weight of, 
and its proximity to, the other caps inserted in the same 
carton. Consequently, since the cap does not have sufficient 
strength in a radial direction, it can ovalize and, by 
cooling completely in a deformed position, it becomes 
troublesome if not impossible to use it in the automatic 
machines used to apply caps to cans, consequently leading 
to a large number of rejects. Furthermore, the problem of ovalization is avoided in 
caps provided, in correspondence with the coupling edge, 
with a step extending externally, since such step acts as a 
stiffening ridge. Another drawback which can be ascribed to the solution 
described above resides in the fact that the presence of 
the internal ridges on the skirt of the cap causes an 
external surface shrinkage that creates a visible element 
which is not always accepted by the user. A principal aim
