<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a process for detecting combustion 
irregularities in an internal combustion engine in order to 
make a combustion diagnosis, particularly at medium and 
high speed. It extends to a device for implementing said 
process and to injection engine control systems equipped 
with such devices. Combustion irregularities in an internal combustion engine 
(misfires and partial combustion) are interesting to 
diagnose because they are indicative of various disorders 
liable to affect either the preparation of the air/fuel 
mixture, or the ignition means, or a mechanical component 
(tightness of a valve). Moreover, these combustion defects 
increase pollutant emissions and can lead to external 
combustion causing damage to catalytic exhaust systems. The following vocabulary is used below: 
active TDC (active top dead center): angular position of 
the crankshaft which precedes the expansion of the 
gases, corresponding to the minimum distance between the 
piston and the top of the cylinder head, combustion phase of a cylinder: phase during which the 
explosion of the gases occurs after ignition, this phase 
extending at medium and high speeds from ignition to 
about half of expansion, active cylinder: cylinder in which combustion takes 
place, cycle: time interval between two active TDC of a 
cylinder. Partial combustion in a given cycle causes a variation of 
the drive torque in an engine and hence a variation in the 
engine speed in comparison with the average speed 
considered over many cycles. Today, it is known how to 
detect these speed variations, on the one hand, at low 
engine speed (below 3000 rpm), irrespective of the load 
applied, and, on the other, at medium speed under high 
load. For example, the publication by Günther Plapp et al,  
 
'Methods of on-board misfire detection, SAE 900232, 1990', 
describes a process in which the average engine speed is 
compared during successive combustion phases in order to 
detect significant variations. However, at high speed or 
under low load, these variations in average speed have 
relatively low values and are impossible to detect. 
Furthermore, irrespective of the speed, these relative 
variations are not necessarily indicative of a combustion 
irregularity, and may be confused with variations in the 
engine speed. To make a reliable diagnosis, it is 
accordingly necessary to equip the engine with an 
additional displacement transducer (French Patent 
No.91.12743) (FR-A-2682718)) or with an accelerometer, to invalidate the 
fault

A process for detecting combustion irregularities 
of an internal combustion engine, serving to make a 

combustion diagnosis, particularly at medium and high 
speed, of the type consisting in measuring the time 

intervals between the predetermined angular positions of a 
rotating part integral with the crankshaft, in calculating 

from these differences a parameter representative of a 
variation in speed, and in comparing this parameter with a 

fault threshold, said process being characterized in that: 

(a) for each phase of combustion of the engine, a sampling 
window is defined, centered on an angular position, 

called the reference position, corresponding to a 
predetermined moment of the combustion phase concerned, 

said sampling window exhibiting a width less than twice 
the angular distance between two combustions,
