<CLAIMS>
A device for the regulation of the feed rate of liquid circulated 
by a centrifugal pump in a closed piping system and more particularly for 

the regulation of water circulation in a heating system, characterized in 
that the centrifugal pump is operated keeping to a pump characteristic 

representing the pumping head (H) divided by the feed rate (Q), which possesses 
a trend dropping toward zero feed rate (Q = 0). 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the centrifugal 
pump has a pump characteristic, whose head at a feed rate of zero 

amounts to approximately 80 % of the head at the design point of the centrifugal 
pump. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the centrifugal 
pump possesses impeller blades with a blade exit angle of 60° or 

more. 
The device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the blade 
exit angle amounts to approximately 90°. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the centrifugal 
pump possesses an impeller with eleven or more blades. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the centrifugal 
pump possesses an impeller, whose entry edges have only a small 

inclination of the axis of rotation of the centrifugal pump. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by a centrifugal 
pump, in the case of which the incident flow edge of the spur is formed in 

the intermediate part between the header space, following the impeller, and 
the entry into the pump delivery outlet is sharp-edged and rectangular and 

on the side facing the pump delivery outlet is rounded.  
 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized that the electric 
motor for driving the centrifugal pump has a rigid characteristic.
