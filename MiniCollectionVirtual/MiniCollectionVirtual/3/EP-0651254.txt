<ABSTRACT>
Reagent kit which contains at least one container in which a reagent is contained, and an analyser in which a reagent kit of this type may be used. In order to make it possible to maintain the reagents at a suitable temperature, the reagent kit is characterised in that it is essentially composed of a housing (12) which has a base (13) and lateral walls (14-18) and the at least one container (31, 32) contained in the housing, the housing consisting of a material, the thermal conductivity of which is greater than that of air, and having at least one internal wall (43-46) which is in contact with positive engagement at least with part of the outer wall of the at least one reagent container (31, 32). The reagent kits are arranged in the analyser on a support plate which is cooled by means of a Peltier element.
