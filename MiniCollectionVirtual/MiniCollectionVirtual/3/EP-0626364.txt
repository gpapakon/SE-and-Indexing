<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a cyclic ketone from a dicarboxylic acid by decarboxylation and cyclisation. The process of preparation of the invention is characterised in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an effective amount of a condensed or noncondensed neutral phosphate. The invention is more particularly targeted at the preparation of cyclopentanone from adipic acid and of 2,2-dimethylcyclopentanone from 2,2-dimethyladipic acid.
