<ABSTRACT>
Immobilized garlic alliinase wherein the alliinase is chemically, physically or biologically immobilized, is useful in a method for continuous production of allicin. The method comprises adding a solution of alliin as substrate to a column containing said immobilized garlic alliinase and collecting pure allicin in the effluent. The pure allicin is intended for use as food additive or for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, high levels of cholesterol and blood lipids, high blood pressure and thrombosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMOBILIZED ALLIINASE AND CONTINUOUSPRODUCTION OF ALLICINFTFLD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to immobilized garlic alliinase in its biologically active form, and the use of said immobilized alliinase in a method for the manufacture of substantially purified allicin for use as active ingredient of pharmaceutical compositions and as food additive.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Garlic and onions are members of the lilly family. Many medical properties have been ascribed to garlic and onions and they have been used in folk medicine for thousands of years.A large spectrum of medical properties has been ascribed to garlic, Allium sativum, (Block, 1985). In modern times the interest in the therapeutic properties of garlic has been resumed, and it is object of an increasing number of biochemical and clinical studies.Garlic preparations are commercially available in the form of garlic oil, extracts, pills or tablets. Usually the preparation procedures of such garlic preparations are unknown, and the composition and amount of their active ingredients are not defined.The active principles present in garlic have been found to be mainly sulfur- containing compounds. The principal component of a colorless oil obtained from steam distillates of garlic extracts was shown to be an unusual sulfur compound of formula C6H10S2O, named allicin (thio-2-propene- 1 -sulfinic acid S-allyl ester) (Cavallito et al., 1944). Allicin was found to be a chemically unstable, colorless liquid that is thought to be responsible for both the odor and much ofthe biological activity of garlic. Although allicin is responsible for the smell of garlic, a garlic bulb exhibits little or no odor until it is cut or crushed. The intact garlic clove does not contain allicin but rather 

its odorless precursor alliin (+)(S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide) that is converted to allicin, pyruvate and ammonia by a C-S-lyase present in the garlic plant termed alliin lyase or alliinase [E.C. 4.4.1.4.] (Stoll and Seebeck, 1949). Alliin and alliinase are found in different compartments ofthe garlic clove. The cutting or crushing of the clove enables the enzyme to come into contact with the precursor of allicin.Studies performed with garlic preparations confirmed some of the medical activities attributed to garlic. Thus garlic juice was shown to inhibit the growth of bacteria of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Vibrio and Bacillus and of zoopathogenic fungi and many strains of yeast, including Candida albicans (Block, 1985; Appleton and
