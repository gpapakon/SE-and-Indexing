<ABSTRACT>
A copper-containing hydrogenation reaction catalyst is 
prepared by reducing a precursor of a copper-containing 

catalyst usable in hydrogenation reaction with hydrogen gas 
or a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas by liquid phase 

reduction in a stream of a solvent in the temperature range 
of from 50 to 140°C. An alcohol is produced using the 

catalyst thus obtained in a fixed bed continuous reaction 
system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing
a copper-containing catalyst usable in hydrogenation
reaction, and to a method for producing an alcohol. More
specifically, it relates to a method for preparing a copper-containing
catalyst usable in hydrogenation reaction
(hereinafter referred to as a copper-containing
hydrogenation reaction catalyst) by a liquid phase reduction
under specified temperature conditions, and to a method for
producing an alcohol of high quality at a high productivity
using the copper-containing hydrogenation reaction catalyst
which is prepared by the above method and which has markedly
improved catalytic activity and selectivity.Since the 1930s a number of methods have been disclosed
for producing aliphatic alcohols, alicyclic alcohols or
aromatic alcohols by hydrogenating carboxylic acids or
esters of carboxylic acids. In those methods, copper
catalysts are mainly proposed for use in hydrogenation of
esters of carboxylic acids, particularly fatty acid esters 
and copper-chromium catalysts are commonly used for
industrial purposes.Determination of the conditions employed to activate
the precursors of these catalysts by reduction depends on
the form and reduction method of the precursors, usage of
the obtained catalysts, and other factors. For example,
when the fluidized bed reaction system is used, a powder
form is employed. In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.
1-305042 (US-A-4 918 248), 5-177140 and 5-117185, it is stated
that a catalyst precursor may be activated by gas phase reduction
or by liquid phase reduction in a solvent exemplified by
hydrocarbons such as paraffin, ethers such as dioxane,
alcohols, and esters. Gas phase reduction, however,
requires an additional apparatus other than the reactor for
reductive activation of a powdery catalyst precursor and
further needs a surface stabilizing treatment for preventing
the resulting copper from being oxidized by air. Because of
these drawbacks of gas phase reduction, liquid phase
reduction is generally employed in the fluidized bed
reaction system. In this case, it is generally agreed that
reduction is carried out preferably at a temperature of from
150 to 350°C until hydrogen absorption has stopped. Since
heat removal is easy in the case of powdery form, local
overheating can easily be prevented.GB-A-2 017 682 discloses liquid phase reduction of a homogeneous colloidal catalyst in a
fluidized bed reactor.On the other hand, when a fixed bed reaction system is
used, gas phase reduction is exclusively used for the
reduc
