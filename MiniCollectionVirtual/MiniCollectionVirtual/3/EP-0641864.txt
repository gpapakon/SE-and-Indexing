<ABSTRACT>
In the oxidative rosting of refractory gold ores in a fluidised bed with fuel addn., the novelty is that sulphur and/or pyrites is added as fuel to the fluidised bed and roasting is carried out at 400-650 (pref. 500-550) deg.C while supplying oxygen-contg. gases.

<CLAIMS>
A method for roasting refractory gold ores in an
oxidising atmosphere in a fluidised bed with the

addition of fuels and with oxygen-containing gas being
supplied, the roasting being effected at temperatures

of 500 to 550°C, characterised in that elemental
sulphur is added to the fluidised bed as fuel.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that at least one additional fuel, selected from

hydrocarbons having a number of carbon atoms from 1 to
16, alcohols having a number of carbon atoms from 1 to

6 and a number of OH groups from 1 to 2, organic ethers
having a number of carbon atoms from 2 to 8 and a

number of O atoms of 1, CS
2
 or H
2
S is added to the
fluidised bed as fuel in addition to sulphur.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that 60 to 80% of the gold ore to be roasted has a

size of less than 75 µm.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the O
2
 content of the gas which is
introduced into the fluidised bed is 20 to 50% by

volume.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the roasting is effected in a

circulating fluidised bed.
