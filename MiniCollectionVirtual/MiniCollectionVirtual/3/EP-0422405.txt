<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle bodywork component (1) has a recess (3) housing a lighting 
device (5), for example a headlamp. The device (5) is advantageously hinged 

on the bodywork component (2) so as to rotate between a first position in 
which it is housed in the recess (3) and secured to the component (1) and a 

second position in which it is extracted from the recess (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle bodywork 
component incorporating a lighting device. The present invention relates in particular, but 
not exclusively, to a bumper of an industrial vehicle 
incorporating a headlamp. It is known that headlamps are normally inserted in 
a recess formed in the vehicle body or in the bumpers of 
the vehicle. In order to improve the operations for 
maintaining the headlamp have been built devices in 
which the assembly and dismantling of a lighting device 
can be readily carried out. For instance patent DE-A-3402274 shows a bodywork 
component comprising a head lamp housed in a recess of 
the bodywork and a hinge interposed between the bodywork 
component and one side of the headlamp. The hinge is 
adapted to allow the headlamp to rotate between a first 
position in which the headlamp is housed in the recess 
and a second position in which the headlamp is extracted 
from the recess. The headlamp and the recess are provided with means 
for positioning the headlamp in the recess and for securing 
the headlamp in the recess. The known positioning and securing means are affected 
by the vibrations of the bodywork and do not  
 
allow an accurate relative relative positioning of the 
headlamp in the recess. The present invention provides a vehicle bodywork 
component of the type comprising a recess housing a 
lighting device and means for fastening this lighting 
device in the recess, said fastening means comprise at 
least one hinge interposed between the bodywork component 
and one end of the lighting device; the hinge is 
adapted to allow the lighting device to rotate between a 
first position in which it is housed in the recess and a 
second position in which it is extracted from the recess; 
said lighting device having first connection and 
securing means adapted to be coupled to second connection 
and securing means borne by the bodywork component 
at an end opposite to the end connected to the hinge; 
characterized in that the first connection and securing 
means comprise two hollow bodies provided in an 
outer wall of the lighting device and in that the second 
means comprise two projections extending from an 
inner wall of the recess and adapted to engage with the respective 
hollow bodies to define an accurate relative positioning 
of the lighting device with respect to the bodywork 
component; the first connection and securing means further 
comprise at least one threaded portion supported by 
the lighting device and in that the second connection 
and

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle bodywork component of the type comprising 
a recess housing a lighting device and means for 

fastening this lighting device in the recess, said 
fastening means comprise at least one hinge (11) 

interposed between the bodywork component (1) and one end 
(10) of the lighting device (5); the hinge (11) is 

adapted to allow the lighting device (5) to rotate 
between a first position in which it is housed in the 

recess (3) and a second position in which it is extracted 
from the recess (3); said lighting device (5) having 

first connection and securing means (15) adapted to be 
coupled to second connection and securing means (16) 

borne by the bodywork component (1) at an end (17) 
opposite to the end (10) connected to the hinge (11); 

characterized in that the first connection and securing 
means (15) comprise two hollow bodies (38,39) 

provided in an outer wall (14) of the lighting device (5) 
and in that the second means (16) comprise two 

projections (34,35;41) extending from an inner wall (17) of 
the recess (3) and adapted to engage with the respective hollow bodies 

(38,39) to define an accurate relative positioning of the 
lighting device (5) with respect to the bodywork 

component (1); the first connection and securing means 
(15) further comprise at least one threaded portion (45) 

supported by the lighting device (5) and in that the 
second connection and securing means (16) comprise at  

 
least one screw (37) which forms a connection with the 

threaded portion (45). 
A bodywork component as claimed in claim 1 
characterized in that the screw (37) engages with a 

through hole (36) in the inner wall (17) of the recess 
(3) and in that stop means (46) cooperate with this screw 

(37) to prevent its axial displacement with respect to 
the hole (36). 
A bodywork component as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the stop means (46) are formed by 

an elastic segment (46). 
A bodywork component as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the projection 

(34, 41) is formed essentially by a boss (41) made from 
an elastically deformable material. 
A bodywork component as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it is formed by a 

bumper (1). 
A bodywork component as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the lighting 

device (5) is formed by a headlamp.
