<ABSTRACT>
A vaginal discharge collection (250) device is formed of an elastomeric rim (252) and a flexible film reservoir (254). The rim (252) may have a generally rectangular cross section and forms a collection space for collecting vaginal discharge. The reservoir (254) may be collapsible so as to be substantially enclosed within the rim (252) when the device is being used. Advantageously, the rim (252) and the reservoir (254) are arranged such that compressing diametrically opposed portions of the rim (252) toward each other causes a leading portion of the rim (252) to dip downwardly to facilitate insertion of the device. The device is ergonomically constructed so as to be convenient to use, comfortable to wear internally, and reliable. A system for reliably, comfortably and conveniently introducing agents, including drugs and other substances, into the vaginal canal is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to feminine
hygiene devices, and more particularly to a vaginal
discharge collection device for collecting vaginal
discharge. The present invention also relates generally to
the intravaginal delivery of drugs and other substances.From the time after World War I, when bandages were
marketed as sanitary napkins, to the present, there have
been essentially only two types of commercially available 
menstrual collection products: sanitary napkins and
tampons. Sanitary napkins, including the newer pads and
shields, have the disadvantages of bulk, odor and leakage.
They also present disposal problems, and they are sometimes
detectable to others. Their absorbent nature can also
create problems of contamination and infection. Tampons
are also disadvantageous. The basic design of the tampon
does not stop leakage and the externally worn string can
lead to contamination. Tampons have fibers which irritate
the vaginal mucosa. Absorptive tampons can also contribute
to serious infections.U.S. Patents Nos. 3,983,874 (Davis), 3,128,767
(Nolan), and 3,216,422 (Steiger) disclose absorptive cup-shaped
vaginal tampons. These devices are bulky and would
be difficult to use and uncomfortable to wear, and would
have the same dangers of infection presented by
conventional absorptive tampons. Other internal vaginal
discharge collection devices are disclosed in U.S. Patents
Nos. 3,845,766 (Zoller), 3,841,333 (Zalucki), 3,626,942
(Waldron), 3,404,682 (Waldron), 2,616,426 (Gordon),
2,534,900 (Chalmers), 1,986,504 (Cubbon), and 71,414
(Rohleder). These devices all suffer from poor ergonomic
design. They would be difficult to insert and remove,
uncomfortable to wear, and/or unreliable.The Waldron and Chalmers devices are worn in a
lower region of the vaginal canal and generate suction,
particularly during removal. These devices would cause
irritation and pressure, and would damage the delicate
vaginal tissue. The suction generated by the devices would
also make the devices difficult to remove, and would tend
to cause spillage. Further, the Davis,Nolan,Gordon and Rohleder
devices have rims with springs embedded therein. Such
springs make the devices unnecessarily complicated and
expensive to manufacture. The Zoller,Zalucki, Waldron and
Chalmers devices have complicated configurations that would
be relatively expensive to manufacture. The exterior
configurations of these devices may also cause irritation
when worn internally. The Cubbon device has a small flat
loop vulcanized to the under edge of

A vaginal discharge collection device (250), comprising:

an elastomeric rim (252);
a flexible film reservoir (254) attached to said rim;

   
characterised in that
 said rim comprises a generally rectangular
cross section for creating a collection space for collecting vaginal

discharge;

said rim (252) having a first generally circular configuration for
creating the collection space for collecting vaginal discharge, said rim

being compressible from said first configuration to a second generally
figure- eight-shaped configuration for insertion of said device into position

for use, wherein diametrically opposed portions (264,266) of said rim are
in contact with each other when said rim is in said second configuration,

and wherein said rim is capable of elastomerically self-restoring itself
from said second configuration to said first configuration;
said rim (252) is formed of an injection molded thermoplastic
rubber;
said rim (252) being formed of two parts styrenic-olefinic block
copolymer and one part low density polythylene.
A vaginal discharge collection device according to claim 1 wherein
said rim (252) and said reservoir (254) are arranged such that compressing

diametrically opposed portions (264,266) of said rim toward each other
