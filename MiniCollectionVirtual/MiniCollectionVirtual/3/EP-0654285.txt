<ABSTRACT>
A cardiac pacemaker having an automatic pulse rate 
response gain factor responsive to at least one cardiac-related 

physiological characteristic of a patient. The 
pacemaker includes a rate controller that comprises a 

detector for detecting a plurality of individual 
measurements of at least one physiological characteristic 

over each of a plurality of pre-determined time periods, 
with each of the individual measurements being an average 

of values detected over each of a respective multiple 
number of incremental time periods occurring within each of 

the pre-determined time periods. The pacemaker saves the 
highest measurement from one incremental time period of 

each of several consecutive pre-determined time periods, 
and these highest measurements are averaged. Thereafter, 

the rate controller adjusts the rate response gain factor 
or slope of the pulse rate in relation to the physiological 

characteristic measurement and a pre-determined target 
pulse rate. In a preferred embodiment, two physiological 

characteristics are measured, with high values averaged of 
only one characteristic when that characteristic exceeds a 

threshold level of the other characteristic. One 
embodiment is pulse rate responsive to minute volume 

measurement in combination with accelerometer measurement, 
with accelerometer measurement requiring a threshold value 

over an increment of time prior to minute volume 
recordation for input toward rate response gain factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to rate responsive 
cardiac pacemakers, and in particular to a pacemaker whose 
rate response gain factor or slope adjustment is 
automatically provided in relation to cardiac-related 
physiological characteristics of a patient. Rate response gain factor or slope adjustment is an 
important aspect in cardiac pacemaker operation as 
physiological consideration of a patient becomes more and 
more integrated with treatment modes. Further, because of 
the vagaries among patients, pre-set and solely manually 
adjustable arbitrary settings in a pacemaker device to 
regulate pulse delivery rates are not practical or in the 
best interest of the patient. Individual testing sessions 
for each patient, while perhaps desirable, are not 
practical because of time and money investments needed for 
such a program. It is, of course, obvious that increased patient 
activity requires increased pulsed delivery from a 
pacemaker. However, it is important that this increased 
pulse velocity have a physiological relationship to its 
need. Measurements that have cardiac relevance to pulse 
velocity requirements include minute volume, general 
patient activity which can be equivocated to accelerometer 
response in a so equipped pacemaker, right ventricle stroke 
volume, right ventricular pressure, blood oxygen level, 
central venous blood temperature, and the like. It is therefore a primary object of the present 
invention to provide a cardiac pacemaker which captures 
peak values of at least one cardiac-related physiological 
measurement over a consecutive preset number of time 
segments and then provides for automatic adjustment of the 
rate response slope. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a cardiac pacemaker which compares peak values of 
two separate physiological measurements wherein one such  
 
measurement must reach a preset threshold level before peak 
values of the other measurement are captured over a number 
of present time segments for use in pulsing rate 
adjustments. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a cardiac pacemaker which compares minute volume 
measurements to patient activity measurements and captures 
peak minute volume levels coincident to significant patient 
activity levels as exemplified by accelerometer values 
exceeding a threshold level over a plurality of separate 
time segments. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a cardiac pacemaker which captures the minute 
volume ratios of each peak
