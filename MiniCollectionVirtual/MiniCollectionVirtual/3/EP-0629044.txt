<ABSTRACT>
In digital image processing, it is often 
necessary to alter the image by performing a zoom 

operation thereon. Such an operation is carried out 
with the use of a spatial interpolation unit. 

Described herein is a spatial interpolation unit which 
comprises a discrete set of filters for which at least 

some of the cut-off frequencies are logarithmically 
spaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital
signal processing and is more particularly concerned
with the implementation of continuous zoom to a
digital image.In electronic or hybrid imaging systems
where the input comprises either stationary images or
time-varying image sequences, it may be desired to
subject these images or image sequences to static or
dynamic spatial interpolation (pan or zoom). The
interpolation may be required for spatial standards
conversion, for image magnification within a fixed
spatial standard, or other applications.In general, spatial interpolation is
achieved by means of a low-pass filter which
attenuates all frequencies above the nyquist frequency
of the output signal (anti-aliasing) whilst maximising
pass-band response and enables a variable phase-shift
of the output signal with respect to the input signal.
In the case of dynamic zoom, since the zoom ratio
varies from frame-to-frame, it is also required that
the cut-off frequency of the interpolation filter be
easily adjustable.A control parameter, zoom ratio, R, can be
defined as the quotient of m/n where m is the pixel
length of the output from a spatial interpolation
unit, and n is the pixel length corresponding to a
particular image feature input to the spatial
interpolation unit, m and n being measured to sub-pixel
accuracy. The definition of this control
parameter holds for both image magnification within a
fixed spatial standard and for spatial standards
conversion. The cut-off frequency of each filter, 
described in terms of a fraction of the input nyquist
frequency, is therefore defined to be equal to the
zoom ratio.In some applications where speed is not a
limiting factor, it may be possible to generate the
interpolation filter coefficients for the zoom ratio
required for each image frame in-situ. Two possible
methods can be used to achieve this as is well known:
1) using a windowed sinc function (Digital
Image Processing, W K Pratt, Wiley-InterScience, pages
291 to 295) as a continuous or sampled impulse
response. The window width (Hamming window is often
preferred) defines the number of filter taps, and the
cut-off frequency is defined by the width of the sinc
function.2) using an optimisation method to
generate a low-pass filter with variable cut-off
frequency and stop- and pass-band performance, for
example, the Remez Exchange Algorithm (Theory and
Application or Digital Signal Processing, Rabiner and
Gold, Prentice-Hall 1975, pages 136 to 140).GB-A-2 240 684 discloses a digital signal
interpolator arrangement
