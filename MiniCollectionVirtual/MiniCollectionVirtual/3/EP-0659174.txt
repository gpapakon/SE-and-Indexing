<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new derivatives of 2-propylpentanoic
acid (valproic acid, hereinafter VPA),
and 2-propyl-2-pentenoic acid, their preparation and use
as antiepileptic agents.VPA and its alkali salts are major drugs in the arsenal
of drugs for the treatment of epileptic seizures and
convulsions. However, approximately 25% of epileptic
patients do not respond to current treatment.
Furthermore, VPA itself has considerable adverse effects
including hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity. Baille,
T.A. and A.W. Rettenmeier, in "Antiepileptic Drugs," ed.
by R.H. Levy, F.E. Dreifuss, R.H. Mattson, B.S. Meldrum
and J.K. Penry, Raven Press, New York (1989), at 601-619.One approach to obtain improved antiepileptic agents has
been to prepare the primary amide derivatives of VPA and
its anaiogs. M. Bialer, Clin.Pharmacokinet.20: 114-122
(1991); M. Bialer, A. Haj-Yehia, N. Barzaghi, F. Pisani,
and E. Perucca, Eur. J. Clin.Pharmacol., 289-291 (1990);
A. Haj-Yehia and M. Bialer, J. Pharm.Sci., 79: 719-724
(1990). While certain glycinamide derivatives have been
disclosed by R. Roncucci, et al., U.S. Patent 4,639,468,
issued January 27, 1987, these compounds generally have
not been accepted into clinical practice. Thus, an
urgent need still exists in the art for developing anticonvulsant
agents with improved efficacy and a wider
margin between the dose which is therapeutic and that
which is neurotoxic.VPA and 2-ene-VPA-related glycine amides have been
disclosed by Granneman, et al., Xenobiotica, 14, 375
(1984), to be minor metabolites of VPA. However, an
examination of the mass spectral data therein shows that 
those compounds are in fact VPA and 2-ene-VPA glycine and
cannot be glycinamide conjugates, wherein the glycine
nitrogen moiety is attached to the VPA or 2-ene-VPA
carbonyl. While Granneman, et al., described these
compounds as glycine conjugates, they erroneously named
them as VPA and 2-ene-VPA glycinamides, rather than
valproyl and 2-ene-VPA glycine; the latter names are in
accord with the method of preparation and the mass
spectral data reported by Granneman, et al.EP-A-0 046 707 describes amide derivatives of 4-amino
butyric acid said to have interesting properties on the
CNS and to be of potential use as sedatives, tranquillisers,
hypnotics and anxiolytics. The compounds described have
two amino groups separated by at least 3 carbon groups. This invention provides a compound having general
structure I as follows:

wherein A is X or Y,
X comprises

Y comprises

R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each independently
