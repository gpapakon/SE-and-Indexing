<ABSTRACT>
Capillary spaces (30) extending between fibers, are formed by communicating pores. These are open at the surface to be treated. Mean pore diameter exceeds or is close to that of the fibers. An Independent claim is included for the method of making a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic band. A fibrous strand or band with felt-like arrangement of fibrous sections is pressure-impregnated using a dispersion including thermoplastic particles with additional particles. Following drying, the thermoplastic particles are melted together. The melt is consolidated to a porous thermoplastic matrix.

Composite material (10, 100) comprising fibers (1) which are
embedded in a thermoplastic matrix (20), which has a free surface

(11) to be treated, with one or more capillary spaces (30) which
extend between the fibers, which are at least partly formed by

communicating pores and which are open towards the surface
(11) to be treated, 
characterized in that
 an average diameter of the
pores is greater than, equal to or not substantially less than an

average diameter of the fibers.
Composite material in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the fibers (1) form a unidirectional bundle; or 
in that
 the fibers
are present in the form of fiber pieces which form a pile or a

felt-like arrangement; and 
in that
 the thermoplastic matrix (20) is
produced by means of a pressure impregnation.
Composite material in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 the capillary spaces (30) have resulted under the
influence of additional particles (3) which are deposited as foreign

bodies in the thermoplastic matrix (20) between the fibers (1),
with the proportion of the additional particles (3) - in relation to

the total volume of the thermoplastic matrix and of the additional
particles - amounting to about 5 to 30 % by volume.
Composite material in accordance with claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the additional particles (3) consist of organic substances, in 
particular of plastics, the melting points of which lie at least 10 K

above the melting point of the thermoplastic matrix; or 
in that

they consist of inorganic substances such as for example glass or
ceramics.
Composite material (100) in accordance with any one of the
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 it is composed of a plurality of
fiber reinforced thermoplastic bands (10,10', 10") which are arranged

one above the other one above the other when welded -
for example by means of a pultrusion -, with preferably only the

surface (11) to be treated containing one band (10) or a plurality
of bands with capillary spaces (30).
Method for the manufacture of a fiber reinforced thermoplastic
band (10) which is a composite material in accordance with any

one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a fiber strand or a
band consisting of fiber pieces (1) which are arranged in a felt-like

manner is pressure impregnated with a dispersion (12) containing
thermoplastic particles (2), with the dispersion containing additional

particles (3) of an organic or an inorganic material which
have a higher melting point than the thermoplastic particles; 
in
that
 after a drying phase the thermoplastic particles are melted;
and 
in that
 the melt which is thereby formed is consolidated to
form a porous thermoplastic matrix (20, 30).
Method in accordance with claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the
additional particles (3) consist at least partly of soluble substances; 

and 
in that
 after the consolidation of the thermoplastic
matrix (20) these particles are removed from the matrix through

dissolving, with in particular the liquid phase of the dispersion
consisting of a saturated solution of a salt and the additional particles

(3) consisting at least partly of crystals of the salt.
Method for the manufacture of a fiber reinforced thermoplastic
band (10) which is a composite material in accordance with any

one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a fiber strand or a
band consisting of fiber pieces which are arranged in a felt-like

manner are pressure impregnated with a dispersion containing
thermoplastic particles (2), with particles (2, 3) in which an expanding

agent is contained being dispersed; and 
in that
 in a heating
phase the particles are melted while liberating the expanding

agent, which passes into the gas phase and forms bubbles in so
doing; and 
in that
 the thus produced melt is consolidated to form
a porous thermoplastic matrix (20, 30).
Use of the composite material (10, 100) in accordance with any
one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 a wall piece (5) to be
reinforced is reinforced with at least one section of the composite

material, with it being possible to produce a solidifying connection
layer between the section (10, 100) and the wall piece (5) with a

bonding mass, in particular an adhesive, which is flowable during
the processing and which can in this condition penetrate into the

capillary spaces (30) of the composite material. 
Use of the composite material (10, 100) in accordance with any
one of the claims 1 to 5 as a porous carrier for a coating (6) or a

coat of paint, with the material of the coating or of the coat of
paint being applied to the surface (11) to be treated - with an at

least partial penetration into the capillary space (30).
