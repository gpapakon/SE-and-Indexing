<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates 
tool useful for assembling a composite connector from a 
substrate on which is mounted at least one electrical 
connector with contact terminals with right angled tails 
extending into bores in the substrate. Figures 1A and 1B are, 
respectively, side and rear elevational views of a prior art 
electrical connector C showing the same mounted to the surface 
of a substrate, such as a printed circuit board PCB. In the 
Figures the connector C is meant to represent any of the 
variety of connector products sold by the Electronics 
Department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, 
including the modularized header and receptacle connectors 
sold under the trademark Metral™. Such Metral™ header and 
receptacle modules are discussed generally in the DuPont 
Connector Systems Product Catalog A, February 1992, Chapter 
10. In the generalized case the connector C includes an 
insulating body B which carries a plurality of electrical contact 
terminals therein. The terminals may be signal transmission 
terminals of either the pin or receptacle type, bladed power 
terminals, and/or hybrid coaxial/power/guide terminals. Each 
terminal includes a tail, generally indicated by the character T, 
that extends through the rear surface of the body B. The form of each tail T varies in accordance with the type 
of terminal of which it is a part. The various forms of tails are 
best illustrated in Figure 1B. The tail of a signal transmission 
terminal, whether of the pin or the receptacle type, is indicated  
 
in the Figures by the specific reference character Ts. A signal 
transmission terminal tail Ts is a generally flat beam member 
having a predetermined transverse dimension Ds. The tails Ts 
of signal transmission terminals are usually arranged into 
nested groups, as is best seen in Figure 1B. Each tail Ts may 
be in the form of a solder tail, or, as is illustrated, have a 
compliant section K immediately above the tip thereof. A 
pushing shoulder S is spaced a predetermined distance above 
the compliant section K. For reasons that will become more 
clear herein each tail Ts is provided with retention features 
generally indicated by the character R. In one instance, as is 
best illustrated in Figure 2A, the retention feature may be 
configured as outwardly flaring barbs indicated by the 
character Rβ . Alternatively, as is best illustrated in Figure 2B, 
the retention feature takes the form of a lanced portion 
indicated by the character RL.The tail of a bladed power terminal is

<CLAIMS>
A tool (10) for use in creating an assembly composed of a substrate (PCB) on 
which is mounted at least one electrical connector with contact terminals with right 

angled tails (T) extending into bores (H) in the substrate; said tool comprising a body 
(12) made of insulating material carrying the contact terminal tails (T), the body (12) 

having a plurality of internal partitions (18) co-operating with one another to define a 
plurality of slots (28), at least some of the slots (28) each having one of the contact 

terminal tails (T) disposed and retained therein in a non-removable manner and such that 
the tails extend from an undersurface of the body at least one mounting member (22) 

formed integrally with the body (12) to extend outwardly from the undersurface of the 
body or another undersurface associated with the body, whereby the mounting member 

(22) is engagable with the substrate and when the tool is mounted to the substrate the 
contact terminal tails are fitted into the bores (H) in the substrate and the tool acts to 

stiffen the substrate and minimizes any tendency of the substrate to bow.  
 
A tool according to claim 1, wherein at least one of the tails (Tb, Ts) has a lanced 
portion (RL) thereon, and the body (12) has an opening (32) therein that accepts the 

lanced portion of the tail to non-removably secure the body to the tail. 
A tool according to claim 2, wherein the body has a back wall (16) and the 
opening (32) extends completely through the back wall. 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein an adjacent pair of the 
partitions (18) each has an arm (18A) thereon, the arms co-operating with one another to 

receive and locate one of the tails (Th) in the associated slot (28).  
 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein at least some of the tails 
have pushing surfaces (S) thereon, and the body is adapted to act against the pushing 

surfaces to insert the tails into the bores (H) in the substrate. 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein at least one of the tails has 
a pushing shoulder (S) thereon and at least one of the partitions (28) has a notch (30) 

therein that accepts the pushing shoulder therein. 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein at least one of the tails has 
a pair of pushing shoulders (S) thereon and at least one adjacent pair of partitions (28) 

each have a notch (30) therein, the notches accepting the pushing shoulders therein. 
A tool according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the body is elongate with 
end regions and there are several mounting members (22) disposed along an 

undersurface of the body. 
A tool according to claim 8, wherein a flange (24A, 24B) extends from each end 
region of the body and each flange has one of the mounting members (22). 
A tool according to any one or more of the preceding claims, wherein the tails 
are arranged in nested groups comprising one or more tails (Ts, Tb), at least some of the 

tails having a first transverse dimension (Ds) while others of the tails have a second 
transverse dimension (Db).
