<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dentifrice composition for 
cleaning teeth. Dentifrice compositions for promoting the health and 
appearance of the mouth, and especially of the teeth and 
gums, are well-known. Such compositions generally contain 
polishing agents, humectants and thickeners. A problem in formulating the typical components of 
dentifrices is that of providing proper texture. Special 
problems arise when the polishing agent is based upon a 
silica abrasive. Upon extrusion from the tube, a dentifrice 
must retain body. Too frequently, however, the extruded 
segment slumps. There is poor cohesion. From its perch atop 
the brush, the dentifrice rapidly spreads forth drooping 
down into the bristles. A related problem is that elegant 
toothpastes are expected to break sharply upon extrusion 
from the tube. The ribbon should not string out; it should 
have shortness of texture. A still further problem of dentifrices, especially of those 
of the clear gel variety, is that of separation and 
shrinking of solids from the paste matrix. Fluids as a 
result exude from the matrix eventually leading to collapse 
and a brick-like solid results. The phenomenon is known as 
weeping. In U.S. Patent 3,689,637, a method is described whereby 
improved shortness of texture is obtained by incorporating 
polyethylene glycol of appropriate molecular weight into  
 
the dentifrice. Although ameliorative of the problem, 
polyethylene glycol does not achieve sufficient shortness 
of texture necessary in such dentifrice formulations as 
silica-based gels. Moreover, the solution is costly.  
 In US-A-4,426,373 smooth dental creams are described, which 
contain a mixture of a medium to high viscosity 
carboxymethyl cellulose gum and a medium to high viscosity 
hydroxyethyl cellulose gum. Such mixture, however, does 
not produce a low stringing and non-weeping dentrifice, as 
is shown by the comparative examples in the present 
application. In DE-A-1948468, Example 1, a dentifrice is disclosed which 
contains an unspecified hydroxyethyl cellulose and an 
unspecified carboxymethyl cellulose. There is no 
disclosure of any particular rheological property of that 
dentifrice.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a dentifrice that exhibits relatively low 
stringiness, good cohesion and minimizes the problem of 
weeping. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
dentifrice that is in the form of a silica-based gel having 
good clarity but low stringiness and being free of weeping.

polyol is exclusively selected from the group consisting of 

glycerol, hydrolyzed polysaccharide, sorbitol, and 
combinations thereof. 
The composition according to claim 1 wherein the 
abrasive is a silica.
