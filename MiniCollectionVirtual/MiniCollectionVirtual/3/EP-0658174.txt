<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the preparation of polytetramethylene ether glycol diesters of the formula R-CO-O(CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O)n-COR1, in which R and R1 are identical or different and are an alkyl radical or a derivative thereof, by polymerization of tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a fixed-bed polymerization catalyst and in the presence of a carboxylic anhydride. The use of a catalyst selected from amorphous aluminium silicate, acid-activated and calcined kaolin or zeolite instead of the known natural montmorillonite catalysts having a cryptocrystalline three-layer structure means that polymers having more uniform properties and a narrower molecular weight distribution are now accessible at a higher polymerization rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG) 
diesters by polymerization of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in 
the presence of a carboxylic anhydride by means of a 
catalyst selected from synthetic amorphous aluminium 
silicate, acid-activated kaolin or zeolite 
which have been calcined before use. The polymerization of THF by oxonium ion 
catalysis became known as the result of the basic work by 
H. Mewerwein et al. (Angew. Chemie 72, (1960), 927) and 
is described comprehensively in the monograph "Polytetrahydrofuran" 
by P. Dreyfuß, Gordon and Breach Sc. Publishers, 
New York, London, Paris 1982. German Offenlegungsschrift DE-A-28 01 792 and 
German Patent 29 16 653 describe a polymerization process 
for THF in which the polymerization of THF purified in a 
separate step is carried out by bleaching earth arranged 
in a fixed bed in the presence of a carboxylic anhydride. 
Bleaching earths are naturally occurring aluminium 
silicates having a cryptocrystalline three-layer 
structure of the montmorillonite mineral. The mineral 
obtained from deposits exhibits physical and chemical 
properties which vary depending on the origin. In particular, 
the activity of the catalysts is not constant, 
but instead varies from batch to batch. In spite of the 
low price, this is a serious disadvantage for commercial 
utilization of bleaching earths as catalysts. The present invention has the object of simplifying 
the polymerization of THF with respect to the industrial 
embodiment and making it reproducible. However, the 
advantages of the process described in German Patent 
29 16 653, in particular the fixed-bed catalysis, should 
be retained.  
 This object is achieved by a process for the 
preparation of polytetramethylene ether glycol diesters 
having the formula R-CO-O(CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O)n-COR1 in which 
R and R1 are identical or different and are an alkyl 
radical having 1-4 carbon atoms, and n is an integer from 
2 to 200, by polymerization of tetrahydrofuran in the 
presence of a polymerization catalyst and in the presence 
of a carboxylic anhydride, characterized in that a 
catalyst selected from synthetic amorphous aluminium 
silicate, acidactivated zeolite or kaolin is used 
whereby the catalysts are calcined at from 350° to 
700°C before use.  
 It has been found, surprisingly, that special 
catalysts which have been pressed to give mouldings and 
are suspended or introduced into a stationary, fixed 
catalyst bed convert a mixture of THF and carboxylic 
anhydri
