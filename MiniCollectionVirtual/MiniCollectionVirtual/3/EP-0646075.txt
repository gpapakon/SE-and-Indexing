<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for retracting a protrusion such as an automobile mascot (1) comprises an assembly (15), on which the protrusion is mounted, pivotally connected (via) upper and lower levers (5) and (13) to a structure like an automobile radiator shell (25). A motor (10) and gearbox (9) are drivably connected to lever (5) and are operative to drive the protrusion (1) through an aperture in the stucture (25) between retracted and erected positions. Microswitches (7, 14 and 15F) control the operation of the motor (10). If the protrusion is subject to a force above a predetermined level, the motor is switched on by microswitch (15F) to retract the protrusion. The motor is switched off by microswitch (14) at the downward limit of its travel and by microswitch (7) at the upper limit of its travel. The motor may be operated by manually operable switch means under the control of a microprocessor which remembers the position of the protrusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for 
retracting a retractable automobile mascot. One such automobile mascot is described in British 
Patent Specification GB-A-1,503,229. Although the 
arrangement operates satisfactorily, the mascot can be 
difficult to re-erect after it has been retracted. According to the present invention, there is 
provided mascot retraction apparatus for retracting a 
retractable automobile mascot comprising a support for the 
retractable mascot, an electric motor, means for 
pivotally connecting the support to the electric motor 
whereby to enable the motor to drive the support between 
a first position in which the mascot is upright and a 
second position in which the mascot is retracted, means 
actuatable when the mascot is subjected to a force in its 
upright position above a predetermined level for 
completing the supply circuit to the motor and means for 
breaking that circuit when the mascot reaches the fully 
retracted position or the upright position. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the  
 
means for connecting the support to the motor comprises 
levers. Advantageously upper and lower levers are 
provided. The actuatable means for completing the supply 
circuit and the means for breaking the supply circuit 
comprise microswitches. The microswitch for completing 
the supply circuit is disposed for actuation by a rod 
connected to the mascot and spring loaded by a helical 
spring. When the mascot is tilted, the rod is moved 
against the force of the spring and actuates the 
microswitch. Two microswitches are provided for actuation 
by upper and lower levers respectively to break the 
circuit to the motor at the limits of travel of the 
mascot. Manually operable switch means are also provided 
for completing the circuit to the motor. The motor is 
disposed to drive the levers through a gearbox. . A 
microprocessor is provided for controlling operation of 
the motor in dependence upon the position of the mascot. 
A member, preferably a security plate, is provided for 
closing off an aperture through which the mascot is 
retracted after retraction. The plate is driven to and 
from its operative position by a cable and pulley 
arrangement. Guides are provided for the cable and also 
for the plate. The pulleys are spring loaded to apply 
tension to the cable. In order that the invention may be more clearly 
understood, one embodiment thereof will now be described,  
 
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:-

<CLAIMS>
Mascot retraction apparatus for retracting a 
retractable automobile mascot (1) comprising a support (3) for the 

retractable mascot, characterised by an electric motor 
(10), means (5,13) for pivotally connecting the support 

(3) to the electric motor (10) whereby to enable the 
motor (10) to drive the support (3) between a first 

position in which the mascot is upright and a second 
position in which the mascot is retracted, means 

actuatable (15F) when the mascot is subjected to a force 
in its upright position above a predetermined level for 

completing the supply circuit to the motor (10) and means 
for breaking that circuit when the mascot reaches the 

fully retracted position or the upright position. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the means 
for connecting the support to the motors comprises levers 

(5 and 13).
