<ABSTRACT>
A synchronous dynamic random access memory device 
allows an external device to sequentially access read-out 

data bits in synchronous with a system clock signal (CK), 
and a column addressing system (151) incorporated in the 

synchronous dynamic random access memory device forms a 
plurality of pipeline stages (150c/150d; 150e; DFF4/DFF5) 

together with an input/ output unit (161) for sequentially 
supplying data bits to a data port (DP10) in response to a 

column address (DC1) internally incremented in synchronism 
with the system clock signal, thereby propagating the data 

bits through a single data bus (161a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device synchronous with an external clock signal and, more
particularly, to a semiconductor memory device such as, for
example, a dynamic random access memory device synchronous
with a system clock of an electronic system.A typical example of the semiconductor memory device
is illustrated in Fig. 1 of the drawings, and is of a
synchronous dynamic random access memory device. The
synchronous dynamic random access memory device largely
comprises a memory cell array 1, a mode-establishing system
2, a row addressing system 3, a column addressing system 4,
a data input/output system 5 and an internal timing
generator 6, and is responsive to an external command code
for establishing an operation mode therein. Namely, the
synchronous dynamic random access memory device has a first
option in a CAS latency, a second option in a burst length
and a third option between a sequential burst and a
interleave burst. The CAS latency is indicative of the 
number of clocks from a read command code READ indicative
of a read-out instruction to the first data output, and the
burst length is the number of column addresses sequentially
selected on the basis of an external column address signal.
In the sequential burst, the lower bits of the internal
column address signal is sequentially incremented, and the
interleave burst causes the lower bits to change an
interleave manner. For example, if the external column
address signal has the lower bits indicative of "0", the
lower bits are changed so as to sequentially indicate "0",
"1", "2" and "3" in the sequential burst. On the other
hand, if the interleave burst is selected, the lower bits
are changed in such a manner as to indicate "1", "0", "3"
and "2" on the basis of the external column address signal
having the lower bits indicative of "1". In the
synchronous dynamic random access memory device shown in
Fig. 1, the CAS latency and the burst length are assumed to
be adjusted to "3" and "4", and the sequential burst is
assumed to be selected.A burst access through the sequential or interleave
burst improves an average access time to each data bit. A
non-synchronous dynamic random access memory device
achieves an access time of 60 nano-second. However, a 
synchronous dynamic random access memory device can
achieves an average access time of 30 nano-second under the
conditions of a system clock at 100 MHz and the CAS latency
at 3, a system clock at 66 MHz and the CAS latency of 2 or
a system clock at 33 MHz and the CAS latency of
