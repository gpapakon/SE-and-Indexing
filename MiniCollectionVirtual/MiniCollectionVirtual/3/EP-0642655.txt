<ABSTRACT>
A transmission line open at one end, is used to determine the level of water, if any, at the bottom of product storage tanks. Changes in capacitance that result from the interface, are transformed by proper matching, into much larger voltage changes at the line input. The voltage measurements are converted to level, by a microprocessor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for measuring and monitoring the water/product interface level at the 
bottom of a product storage tank. 
In particular, the invention relates to an apparatus 
for continuously monitoring the water level at the bottom of a 
product storage tank, e.g. an oil product storage tank. When storing a product in oil industry, e.g. in a refinery, 
distribution terminal or depot, careful measurement of the (oil) 
product (e.g. crude oil, refined products and the like) within 
clearly defined limits of accuracy is essential not only to ensure 
that the purchaser of a quantity of (oil) product receives the 
volume or weight which is invoiced to him and that the seller does 
not over-deliver, but also to enable a constant check to be kept on 
stocks, and on storage, transport and handling losses. In product storage tanks, any free water may accumulate on the 
tank bottom, due to several causes. For example, water may accompany 
the (oil) product during transport and when filling the storage tank 
with (oil) product, water enters the storage tank. Further, 
generally the supply line to the storage tank used is water washed 
prior to each delivery to the storage tank and thus there is a risk 
of water contamination when water is entering the tank ahead of the 
(oil) product. Generally, there is also any residual water left when 
filling and emptying storage tanks. Therefore, in (oil) product storage tanks, water may 
accumulate at the bottom of the tank and a knowledge of the amount of water, if any, at the 
bottom of the tank is essential. This ensures that calculation of 
tank contents deals only with (oil) product stored, not water. This 
is in particular relevant in countries wherein duty is levied on 
(oil) products.  
 Consequently, any miscalculation or loss in product storage and 
handling now involves product on which duty has been paid. 
This, coupled with increased environmental requirements has shown 
the need for more accurate stock accounting systems. The above is particularly relevant when transfer of custody 
and/or duty is involved. At present, testing for water and determination of water level 
in (oil) product storage tanks, is carried out manually (dipping 
techniques) with the usual disadvantages regarding personal 
interpretation (accuracy), safety and measurement frequency. In tanks where water does accumulate, it is normally maintained 
below 80 mm, with a maximum expected level of 150 mm and thus there 
is a need for an instrument which is able to measure

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for measuring and monitoring the water/product interface level at the 
bottom of a product storage tank, comprising a sensor assembly which 

is at the tank bottom and is communicating via signal processing 
electronics with a means for providing information on said water/product interface level; 

wherein said assembly comprises a plurality of 
measurement sensors arranged in a housing provided with one or more 

openings to enable product/water entering or leaving the sensing 
area, the sensors of said plurality of measurement 

sensors being arranged at a different height to cover the measurement 
range; each measurement sensor comprising an open-circuited co-axial 

transmission line to produce a signal representing the depth of 
water at the tank bottom, and the said co-axial transmission line, 

comprising at its open end a monopole antenna or probe, said probe 
being surrounded with an insulating material, and further comprising 

means for exciting the transmission line, and wherein the probe 
length is less than 1/10 of the wavelength used to excite the 

transmission line. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
transmission line is a quarter wave transmission line. 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, comprising 2 or 
3 measurement sensors. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1-3, further 
comprising a reference sensor. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1-4, 
wherein the outer braid of the co-axial line is 

removed from the end section of the line, and the monopole antenna 
or probe attached, and wherein the inner conductor and probe are 

covered by a non-conductive coating.  
 
The apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein the 
length of the braid removed is less than 1/10 of the wavelength used 

to excite the transmission line. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1-6, wherein 
the length of the transmission line is an odd 

multiple of the wavelength divided by four. 
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1-7, wherein 
an operating frequency of 10-100 MHz is 

applied.
