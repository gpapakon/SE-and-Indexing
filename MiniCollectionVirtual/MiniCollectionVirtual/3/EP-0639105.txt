<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for the treatment of fluids, particularly wine, to remove unwanted substances. The wine is first treated in a reverse osmosis treatment unit, generating a retentate and a raw permeate. The membrane for the reverse osmosis unit is selected to pass in the permeate the unwanted substances, which in the case of wine may be volatile acidity (ethyl acetate and acetic acid). The raw permeate is then subjected to a treatment column. In the case of volatile acidity, this is an anion exchange column, which removes the acetic acid from the permeate by anion exchange and removes the ethyl acetate by base hydrolysis. This produces a purified permeate, which is depleted in volatile acidity (which is passed through with the raw permeate), but contains other components desirable for the wine. The purified permeate is then recombined with the retentate from the reverse osmosis column, and the result is wine with the volatile acidity and little else removed. This wine may be recirculated through the system to remove yet more of the volatile acidity. The method may also be applied to the removal of acetaldehyde, in which case a distillation column is used instead of the anion exchange column, and the distillation residue constitutes the purified permeate which is recombined with the retentate from the reverse osmosis column. An embodiment utilizing a high-energy distillation column may be used to separate out alcohol and water, and then add either the alcohol or the water back to the reverse osmosis retentate, thus producing either a higher alcohol or a lower alcohol beverage, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the removal of unwanted
compounds from liquids, and in particular to a recirculative
treatment process and apparatus for removing undesirable
components from wine.It is a persistent problem in the production of wine that
certain compounds are generated in intolerable
concentrations, among which are ethyl acetate, acetic acid
and acetaldehyde. These compounds appear naturally in wine,
but are regarded as spoilage components because they so
alter the flavor and aroma of the wine.It is possible to remove certain undesirable components in
juices by reverse osmosis treatment, but this also removes
important flavor and aroma components, resulting in a change
in the nature of the wine in addition to volume loss and
concentration effects. For instance, in US-A-4,401,678
to Beaumont, a process for removing methyl
anthranilate (which occurs in high concentration in Vitus
labrusca grapes) from grape juice by means of reverse
osmosis treatment is discussed. The portion of the juice
which passes through the reverse osmosis membrane,
containing methyl anthranilate and other volatile esters as
well as sugars and acids, is discarded, and the retentate is
diluted with water to compensate for the higher 
concentration due to the reverse osmosis treatment. While
this process does remove at least some of the undesirable
components, it also removes many desirable components, so
that the resulting juice is not suitable for making standard
wines from Vitus vinifera grapes, i.e. classic wine grapes.
In certain areas, such as California, the addition of water
also renders the juice illegal for the production of
standard wine.There are other processes presently used for removing
organic components from a fluid. For instance, in US-A-4,643,902
to Lawhon et al. (particularly
applicable to orange and grapefruit juice), ultrafiltration
is used to isolate spoilage enzymes in a retentate, with the
remainder of the juice in a permeate. The enzymes are
deactivated, and the permeate and retentate may then be
recombined. The permeate may be subjected to a reverse
osmosis (R.O.) treatment to concentrate the juice before
recombination with the ultrafiltration retentate. After R.O.
treatment and before recombination, the juice (i.e. R.O.
retentate) may further be treated to deacidify it, such as
by the use of an ion-exchange column. This produces a
concentrate which is eventually rediluted (perhaps with the
R.O. permeate, consisting of water) to reconstitute the
juice.This process would be deleterious in
