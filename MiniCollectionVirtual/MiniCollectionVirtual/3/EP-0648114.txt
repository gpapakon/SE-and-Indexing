<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns liposomes which can be obtained by mixing double-layer-forming lipids, containing, at least in part, unsaturated fatty-acid chains, with an aqueous solution of gallic acid and/or at least one derivative of gallic acid and supplying mechanical energy. Before mixing, the lipids may be present either as such or dissolved in a water-miscible solvent. The invention also concerns a method of preparing such liposomes and their use in the preparation of drugs.
