<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of an aqueous dispersion containing between approximately 15 and approximately 50 % by weight of solid products, including the stages of:   (a) incremental addition of one or a number of ethylenically unsaturated monomers capable of being polymerised in an aqueous environment, to a reactor containing water and up to 6.3 parts, per 100 parts of the said monomers, of one or more surfactants; (b) incremental addition of one or more polymerisation initiators to the said reactor; and (c) polymerisation of the said ethylenically unsaturated monomer(s) such that the mean particle size of the said polymerised monomers is smaller than 100 nm.   The aqueous dispersions according to the invention have a wide range of practical applications, in particular in coating compositions, especially for paint.
