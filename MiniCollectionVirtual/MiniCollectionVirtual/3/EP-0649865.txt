<CLAIMS>
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder comprising
polyhydrazides and carbonyl-containing urethane-vinyl

hybrid polymers and, if desired, conventional
additives.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the polyhydrazides have an average

molecular weight (M
n
) of 
<
 1000 and are aliphatic or
aromatic or mixed aliphatic/aromatic compounds

having at least two hydrazine, hydrazide and/or
hydrazone groups.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the carbonyl-containing urethane-vinyl

hybrid polymers are obtainable by free radical-initiated
polymerization of vinyl-containing

urethane macromonomers together with other vinyl
monomers, at least one of the vinyl monomers containing

one or more carbonyl groups, and the content
by mass of vinyl blocks in the polyurethane-vinyl

hybrid dispersion, relative to the mass of the
solids content, being between 1 and 95%, preferably

between 5 and 70%.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
either of claims 1 and 3, wherein the carbonyl-containing

urethane-vinyl hybrid polymers are
obtainable by free radical-initiated polymerization

of vinyl-containing urethane macromonomers together 
with other vinyl monomers, at least one of the vinyl

monomers containing one or more carbonyl groups, and
the vinyl groups being chemically bonded at the

chain ends of the urethane macromonomers (terminal)
and/or along the macromonomer chain (lateral).
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the polyhydroxy compounds

employed for the preparation of the urethane
macromonomers are selected from polyhydroxy polyethers,

polyhydroxy polyesters and polyhydroxy polycarbonates.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the hydrophilic compounds

employed for the preparation of the urethane
macromonomers are selected from isocyanate-functional

or hydroxy-functional polyalkylene oxides
and hydroxy-functional anionic, anionogenic,

cationic or cationogenic compounds.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the vinyl monomers

without a carbonyl group are selected from the group
consisting of the esters of aliphatic alcohols

having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and of unsaturated
carboxylic acids from the group consisting of

(meth)acrylic acid, (iso)crotonic acid and vinyl
acetic acid, or from the group consisting of vinyl

esters, vinyl ethers and aromatic vinyl compounds
such as styrene, vinyl toluenes or vinyl naphthalenes,

and the vinyl monomers containing at least
one carbonyl group are selected from the group

consisting of aliphatic unsaturated mono- or dialdehydes
or of aliphatic unsaturated ketones.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
any of claims 1 to.4 and 7, wherein the vinyl monomers

without carbonyl groups are esters of aliphatic 
alcohols having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and

(meth)acrylic acid.
An aqueous, autocrosslinking binder as claimed in
any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the ratio of the

number of hydrazine groups to carbonyl groups is
from 1:40 to 2:1, preferably from 1:20 to 2:1.
The use of a binder as claimed in any of claims 1 to
9 in resins for printing inks, in adhesives and in

coating compositions for wood, paper, plastics,
leather, textiles and metallic substrates, if

desired in combination with crosslinking agents,
other resins, and further additives such as pigments,

leveling agents, etc.
The use of a binder as claimed in any of claims 1 to
9 in basecoats for the coating of metals.
The use of a binder as claimed in any of claims 1 to
9 in basecoats for the coating of wood.
The use of a binder as claimed in claim 12 in
basecoats for the coating of plastics.
