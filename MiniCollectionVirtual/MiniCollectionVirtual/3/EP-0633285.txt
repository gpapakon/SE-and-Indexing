<ABSTRACT>
Cured, thermoset plastic articles derived from scrap 
polyehter-based polyurethanes are obtained by 

converting the polyurethane to a liquified mixture containing digested polyurethane 
and 

cyclic, unsaturated anhydride. A Lewis acid then catalyzes insertion of the cyclic, 
unsaturated anhydride into the polyether backbone of the polyurethane to give a 

liquid, 
unsaturated resin. The unsaturated resin can be cured with a vinyl monomer in the 

presence of a free-radical initiator to give a cured, thermoset plastic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the manufacture of thermoset plastic articles. Recycled 
polyurethanes are converted to liquid, unsaturated resins that can be combined with 
vinyl monomers and cured to give the plastic articles. Polyurethanes, such as flexible and rigid foams, elastomers, sealants, and the 
like, are usually formulated as crosslinked polymers, so they typically cannot be 
reclaimed or recycled by simply melting the polymer and remolding it. Recycling of 
polyurethanes requires chemical conversion of the polymer. It is known, for example, 
to perform basic hydrolysis of polyurethanes at elevated temperatures to isolate 
components derived from the polyol, polyisocyanate, and chain extender reactants. 
Recovery and reuse of these components is complicated by the presence of catalysts, 
surfactants, fillers, flame retardants, and other additives commonly used to 
manufacture polyurethanes. The high cost of purification makes this strategy 
impractical and commercially unattractive. A more attractive approach avoids purification of the individual components 
following chemical conversion of the polyurethane. In this strategy, the polyurethane 
is converted to a liquid form or is dissolved in a liquid polymer. The liquid product is 
then used to manufacture another polyurethane. U.S. Patent Nos. 2,937,151, 
3,109,824, and 3,117,940, and German Patent DE 3,435,014 illustrate this approach.  
 In EP-A-599 561, we described a new ester insertion 
process in which a cyclic, unsaturated anhydride inserts randomly into carbon-oxygen bonds 
of a polyether to give an unsaturated polyetherester resin. Unlike conventional unsaturated 
polyester resins, the degree of unsaturation in the product can be easily controlled by 
adjusting the ratio of polyether to cyclic, unsaturated anhydride. Thus, unsaturated 
polyetherester resins having a wide range of crosslinkabilities can be made from maleic 
anhydride and a single polyether polyol. Particularly needed in the art are ways to convert scrap polyurethane foams, 
elastomers, and the like, directly to useful liquid polymer resins without the need to first 
isolate polyether polyols from the other components. Ways to convert scrap polyurethanes 
to polymers other than polyurethanes, such as thermoset plastics, are also needed. The invention provides a way to make thermoset plastic articles from scrap 
polyurethanes without any need to isolate or purify individual polyurethane components. According to one aspect, the invention includes a cured, thermoset plastic
