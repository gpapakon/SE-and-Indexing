<ABSTRACT>
In a continuous process for reacting particulate ore with a liquid reagent in a counter-current vertical column, wherein liquid reagent is introduced at the bottom of the column, particulate ore is introduced at the top of the column, reacted particulate ore is removed at the bottom of the column, and spent liquid reagent is removed at the top of the column, the improvement comprising: (a) providing an upper and lower chamber for the vertical column, each of said chambers having a bottom outlet with a diameter which is less than that of the diameter of the chamber; (b) maintaining sufficient upward flow of liquid reagent in the upper chamber so that the particulate ore is wetted and deaerated, at least some fine particles thereof are carried overhead for removal, and the remainder thereof settle and enter the lower chamber; (c) maintaining sufficient fluidization and retention time in the lower chamber so that the desired amount of reaction with the ore takes place, at least some of the fine ore particles which are generated from the reaction process and/or which are introduced with the particulate ore are entrained and carried upward for removal, and the reacted particulate ore exits the lower chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved 
continuous ore reaction process. While other ore 
reaction processes are known, they appear to have one 
or more deficiencies. Benefits of the process of this 
invention and some of the deficiencies of prior art 
processes which are overcome with the process of this 
invention include: 
(1) the ability to operate efficiently and 
economically at pressures in excess of atmospheric, (2) the ability to remove efficiently and 
economically fine particles of ore which are part of 
the ore introduced into the process or which are 
generated during the process, (3) the ability to cool rapidly the ore 
slurry exiting the process and to retard flow of 
liquid reagent out of the process, (4) the ability to operate efficiently and 
economically on a continuous basis, (5) the ability to operate without any 
moving parts in the reactor such as paddle blades or 
stirring mechanisms requiring complex sealing 
mechanisms, all of which would be subject to excessive 
corrosion and erosion, especially at elevated 
temperatures and pressures, (6) the ability to construct the reactor of 
acid resistant brick, rather than expensive metals or 
alloys, because there are no moving parts, and  
 (7) the ability to calculate optimum 
fluidization for carrying out an optimum reaction 
process. (8) the ability to achieve a staging effect 
of a counter-current stirred tank leaching reactor. It should be noted that items (5) and (6) are 
important because at elevated temperatures, and 
especially above about 150°C, only expensive metals and 
alloys resist attack by acid. Thus, the process of 
this invention permits the construction of a reactor 
system which both can operate at high temperatures and 
can utilize inexpensive materials of construction. 
Similarly, item (3) is important because it permits the 
use of inexpensive materials of construction downstream 
of the reactor to receive the reacted ore. In contrast, U.S. Patent 3,529,933, which 
discloses counter-current leaching of ore in a vertical 
column, requires moving valved aperatures to regulate 
the proper upward flow of acid and downward flow of 
ore. A continuous process for reacting 
particulate ore with a liquid reagent in a 
counter-current vertical column, wherein liquid reagent 
is introduced at the bottom of the column, particulate 
ore is introduced at the the top of the column, reacted 
particulate ore is removed at the bottom of the column, 
and spent liquid reagent is removed at the top of the 
column, characterised by:
