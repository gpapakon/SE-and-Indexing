<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a bushing for the terminals of accumulators, in particular lead-acid batteries, in which a terminal pin (4), with the interposition of a sleeve-shaped sealing element (8), projects through a cover opening (2) and the sealing permits an axial movement of the terminal pin (4). For a design which is improved in its action and considerably simplified in its construction, it is envisaged that the cover opening (2) is provided with an inwardly pointing collar (3), and that the part of the sealing element (8) which lies between the collar (3) and the terminal pin (4) is provided with ribs (9) bearing tightly against the terminal pin (4). Furthermore, the sealing element (8) has, above the cover opening (2), a bellows-like section (10) and a sealing ring (11) which is clamped between the end face of the terminal pin (4) and a cell connector (7) by a terminal screw.

A terminal bushing for accumulators, more 
particularly lead-acid accumulators, wherein a sleeve-like 

sealing element is disposed between a post and an 
inwardly extending collar of an aperture in the casing, 

the sealing element having ribs engaging the post and 
forming at its top end an inwardly directed ring seal 

clamped between a shoulder of the post and a cell 
connector by a terminal screw, characterised in that 

the sealing element (8) has a bellows-like part (10) 
between the ribbed (9) part and the top ring seal (11) 

and the post (4) has a rod shape such that it can move 
axially in the sealing element (8). 
A terminal bushing according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the internal cross-section of the 

ribs (9) is less than the external diameter of the post 
(4). 
A terminal bushing according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the voids (13) between the ribs 

(9) are filled with an electrolyte-resistant and 
plastic substance. 
A terminal bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the sealing element (8) has at 

its bottom end an annular shoulder (12) which engages 
below the edge of the collar (3). 
A terminal bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the sealing element (8) is 

injected into the collar (3) of the casing (1).  
 
A terminal bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the sealing element (8) is 

made of an electrolyte-resistant permanently resilient 
material.
