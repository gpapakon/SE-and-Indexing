<ABSTRACT>
A zero-power wide OR gate (500) for implementing the "sum" 
of the "sum of product terms" in a programmable logic 

device (PLD). The wide OR gate (500) includes a single 
additional input transistor (502) for each added "product 

term" input from a sense amplifier. The wide OR gate (500) 
further includes circuitry to decouple the current supply 

from sense amplifiers turned on during sleep mode to limit 
power utilized. To increase operation speed, the wide OR 

gate (500) utilizes a strong current source (504) when 
sense amplifiers are all turned off to quickly pull up 

internal circuitry while utilizing a weak current source 
(506) when sense amplifiers turn on to allow the sense 

amplifiers to more easily overcome the current supply. To 
further increase speed, the wide OR gate includes a 

threshold shifting transistor (514) to shift the pull down 
threshold of the output inverter (512) for when all sense 

amplifiers are turned off while shifting the threshold back 
for when a sense amplifier transitions to on.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wide or 
multiple input OR gates used to implement the "sum" of 
the "sum of product terms" in a programmable logic 
device (PLD). More particularly, the present invention 
relates to circuitry for a zero-power wide OR gate 
responsive to a sleep mode signal to reduce power 
consumption and having circuitry allowing a reduced 
recovery time from a sleep mode. Fig. 1 shows an array structure for a typical prior 
art programmable array logic (PAL) device, a type of PLD 
which utilizes a multiple input OR gate to implement the 
"sum" to produce a "sum of product terms" output. The PAL of Fig. 1 has six inputs I₀₋₅ and four outputs 
O₀₋₃. The inputs I₀₋₅ each have a true output 104 and a 
complement output 106 forming rows connected to 
programmable array cells, such as programmable array 
cell 110, of programmable array cells 108. An array 
cell, such as cell 110, may be programmed to be 
connected or disconnected to an AND gate in the AND 
array 100. Groups of array cells programmed to be 
connected to an AND gate in AND array 100 form a 
"product term" of the "sum of product terms" output. 
The AND array 100 is followed by an OR array 102. Each 
OR gate in the OR array 102 is connected to one or more  
 
AND gates in AND array 100 to provide the "sum" of the 
"sum of product terms" output. Although the OR gates in OR array 102 are shown with 
fixed connections to a number of AND gates in AND array 
100, some PAL circuit configurations allow each OR gate 
in OR array 102 to be programmably connected to any AND 
gate output in AND array 100. The OR gates in OR array 
102 may also have outputs connected to an output logic 
macrocell 114 which is programmable to be either 
registered or combinatorial. Circuitry similar to that 
shown in Fig. 1, including the output logic macrocell 
114, is utilized on the AmPALCE22V10, a device 
manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. To assure sufficient voltage is provided to OR gates 
in OR gate array 102 at a high speed, sense amplifiers 
are utilized by manufacturers to implement the AND gates 
in the AND array 100. Sense amplifiers convert a small 
voltage from the product term into a larger, rail to 
rail, voltage at a high speed to drive an OR gate. 
Circuitry for sense amplifiers utilized to implement an 
AND gate to create a "product term" portion of the "sum 
of product terms" output for a PAL device is shown in 
copending U.S. Application Serial No. 118,432 entitled 
"Latching Zero-power Sense Amplifier With Cascode" which
