<ABSTRACT>
Selection switches (C1...C3-4) make it possible to select an optical path (BC, C1, C2-1, C3-1, D1, B1) from among a plurality of such paths, which are predefined, on a common substrate (PE), each of these switches belonging, for this, to several such paths. Isolation switches (D1...DN) each belong to a single such path. They are arranged at the ends of these paths in order to make it possible to isolate the selected path from optical devices (LEN) which are external to this selector and are connected to the non-selected paths. Cross-talk is thus prevented. The invention applies especially to making an optical link secure.
