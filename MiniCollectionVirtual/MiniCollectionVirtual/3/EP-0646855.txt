<ABSTRACT>
An information retrieval device displays portions of a document requested by a user. The 
information retrieval device has a controller connected to a display screen, input selector 

switches, such as buttons, and non-volatile memory, such as a removable ROM. One or 
more documents, such as a book or magazine, is stored in the non-volatile memory. When 

the device is turned on, a first portion of a document is displayed on a display screen. 
When the user wants to see a different portion of the document, or a different document 

altogether, she presses one of the buttons. Upon detection that a button was enabled, an 
action is performed that changes the display on the display screen. The action performs 

can vary in complexity: it may simply cause the next page of the document to be displayed, 
or may execute a nested hypertext link to cause related information contained in the same 

or a different document to update only a portion of the display screen. The document is 
stored on the non-volatile memory in a manner that allows the display screen to be 

refreshed directly from the non-volatile memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the data processing field. More particularly, this invention is an
information retrieval device specifically designed for displaying one or more documents in
an efficient, cost effective manner.General purpose personal computers have certainly had a revolutionary effect on the
modern world. Only a few short years ago, it was inconceivable that only a few thousand
dollars could buy an incredibly powerful machine capable of performing almost any
imaginable task performed in the workplace or home. In a single day, the same general
purpose personal computer could be instructed to calculate a complex mathematical
equation, compose a letter to a friend, do a regression cost analysis on a spreadsheet, send
a electronic mail message to the President of the United States, and instruct your toaster
to make you a piece of toast.While the general purpose computer is capable of doing just about everything, it has often
been criticized for not doing anything particularly well. Many people clearly do not want
to pay substantial sums of their hard earned money for a general purpose computer that
does thousands of things they don't want to do, but doesn't do a good job at what they do
want to do. This is particularly true in the area of information retrieval, where many
people would love to have a well designed, cost effective electronic alternative to hard
copy media such as books and magazines, but don't want to pay thousands of dollars for a
general purpose computer that does, at best, a mediocre job of performing this task.WO-A-93/4458 describes an electronic pocket organizer wherein
data to be displayed are stored in a volatile RAM. Although the
data may be stored as a bit-map image file, such a file is
not described as refreshing the display screen. GB-A- 238 144 describes a data storage device arranged to receive data from a separate
input device and which comprises a memory and a display, the arrangement being such
that data stored in the memory can be displayed without requiring the input device to be
present.GB-A-2 156 560 describes a portable electronic memorandum device having a memory for
storing data items. Push-buttons are provided for incrementing and decrementing the
memory address used for reading out to a display, for selecting a character to be corrected
or set and for incrementing the character value. Stored data are converted
prior to display.Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 017, no. 590 (P-1635), 27 October 1993 & JP-A-05 173981

<CLAIMS>
An information retrieval device (20) for displaying a document, comprising:

non-volatile memory (30) for storing said document in pre-rendered format;
a plurality of input selector switches (50);
a display screen (40);
controller circuitry (60) connected to said non-volatile memory, said input selector
switches, and said display screen, said controller circuitry determining which portion of

said document to display on said display screen, responsive to said plurality of input
selector switches; and
said controller circuitry being arranged to refresh said display screen directly from that portion of said non-volatile
memory in which said portion of said document is stored.
The device of claim 1, wherein said non-volatile memory is flash memory.
The device of claim 2, wherein the size of said device complies with the PCMCIA
standard.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are displayed on
said display screen and selected by a mouse.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are displayed on
said display screen and selected by a stylus.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are displayed on
said display screen and selected by touch, said display screen being a touch display screen.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are buttons.
The device of claim 1, said controller circuitry further comprising:

a microcontroller cell (65); 
an object register (62) for storing the states of a plurality of hypertext objects; and
a switch selection register (61) for storing the current switch status.
A method for generating and displaying a document on a display (40),
comprising the steps of:


reading initial state data (31) from non-volatile memory (30) in which said docunent is stored in pre-rendered format;
determining a first display state from said initial state data;
displaying on said display screen a first portion of said document from a first document
portion (33,35) of said non-volatile memory corresponding to said first display state; and
refreshing said display screen directly from that portion of said non-volatile memory in which said
first document portion is stored.
The method of claim 9, further comprising the steps of:

monitoring a plurality of input selector switches (50);
responsive to said monitoring step, detecting that an input selector switch has been
enabled;
responsive to said detecting step, changing from said first display state to a second display
state; and
responsive to said changing step, displaying on said display screen a second portion of said
document from a second document portion (34,36) of said non-volatile memory

corresponding to said second display state.
