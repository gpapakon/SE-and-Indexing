<ABSTRACT>
A golf club head has a head (110) and a shaft (111) 
defining an axis, the head having a heel (113), a toe, 

a top (114) and a bottom (115). Connection of the 
shaft to the head involves a socket (112) associated 

with the head, the socket having inner wall structure 
(117) extending in the direction of the axis, and with 

annular wall portions (118-120) relatively angled at 
axially successive locations in the direction, at least 

one of the wall portions (119) providing a locally 
camming surface. The shaft has a lower end portion 

(111a) forcibly received endwise into the socket (112) 
and collapsed at least in part toward the axis in 

response to its forcible reception in the socket, and 
against the camming surface. The wall structure (117) 

forms with the shaft lower end portion (111a) a 
clearance (150, 150a) axially offset from the camming 

surface (119) for reception of adhesive which is 
thereafter caused to cure and adhere the shaft lower 

end portion to the wall structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf clubs, and more 
particularly to the connection of a golf club head to a 
shaft having certain advantages. Many efforts have been made to reallocate 
metallic weight from the hosel area of a golf club to the 
head itself, in order to achieve higher energy 
availability for transfer when the club is swung. Such 
greater energy or momentum is then transferred to the 
golf ball when struck. This requires, for example, 
reduction of metal at the hosel area of the club. Such efforts have included configurations 
wherein a shaft passed through the head of a persimmon 
wood. Typical of such configurations were: Wilson's 
staff model "Dynopower Fluid Feel" wood, produced around 
1957; Wilson's "Helen Hicks" wood, produced in the 
1920's; and certain MacGregor woods, produced in the late 
1930's. See also U.S. Patent 4,995,609 entitled "Iron 
Golf Club Heads", assigned to Callaway Golf Company, 
disclosing a hosel characterized by reduced mass or 
weight. No way was known, to our knowledge, to connect 
a shaft to a golf club iron head, where the shaft passed 
into proximity to the bottom of the head and was reduced 
in diameter at or near the bottom of the head so as not  
 
to interfere with an edge or edges of the sole; also, no 
way was known to connect such a shaft to a non-constant 
tapered bore in an iron hosel to provide a tight 
interference fit along localized extent of the shaft and 
bore, upon axial assembly, enabling very good tactile 
"feedback" sensing, to the player, of head-to-ball 
impact, and also providing annular space for adhesive 
reception between the shaft and bore near the bore taper. Further, locking of the collapsed end of a 
shaft to a bore, by local expansion of the collapsed end, 
was not known. It is one object of the invention to provide an 
improved connection between a golf club head and shaft 
which meets the above needs, the head typically being 
an iron, although the head could also be a wedge, 
chipper, putter, wood, or other type of golf club. A 
golf club according to the present invention includes 
or comprises: 
a) a socket associated with the head, the 
socket having inner wall means extending in the direction 
of the axis, and with annular wall portions relatively 
angled at axially successive locations in that direction, 
at least one of the wall portions providing a locally 
camming surface, b) the shaft having a lower end portion 
forcibly received endwise into the socket, and collapsed 
at least in part toward the axis in response to

<CLAIMS>
A golf club having a head (110) and a shaft 
(111) defining an axis (116), the head having a heel 

(113), a toe, a top (114) and a bottom (115), with an 
improved connection of the shaft (111) to the head 

(110) comprising in combination: 

(a) a socket (112) associated with the head 
(110), the socket having inner wall means (117) 

extending in the direction of said axis (116), and with 
annular wall portions (118-120) relatively angled at 

axially successive locations in said direction, at 
least one of said wall portions (119) providing a 

locally camming surface, 
(b) the shaft (111) having a lower end portion 
(111a) forcibly received endwise into said socket (112) 

and collapsed at least in part toward said axis in 
response to said forcible reception of the shaft lower 

end portion into the socket, and against said camming 
surface (119), 
(c) said wall means (117) forming with said shaft 
lower end portion (111a) a clearance (150, 150a) 

axially offset from said camming surface for reception 
of adhesive to contact the shaft lower end portion and 

to cure and adhere the shaft lower end portion (111a) 
to said wall means (117). 
The club of claim 1 wherein said wall means 
(117) include a first downwardly tapered wall portion 

(119) defining said camming surface, and a second wall 
portion (118) intersecting said first wall portion at

The club of claim 2 wherein said angle is an 
obtuse angle in an axial radial plane intersecting said 

first and second wall portions (119, 118). 
The club of claim 2 wherein said first wall 
portion defines a frusto-conical surface (119) having
