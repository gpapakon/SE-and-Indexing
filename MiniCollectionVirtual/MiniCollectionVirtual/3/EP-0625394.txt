one pair of jaws (23, 24; 25, 26; 56, 57) designed to grip the
piece (A) to be drilled, and each having a plane portion, said

plane portions being perpendicular to each other and thus
defining two reference planes allowing the positioning of a given

point of the section of a piece (A) gripped by the jaws opposite
the drill bit (5, 500).
Machine according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that it comprises means for presenting the two ends of the piece

(A) to be drilled before the bit (5, 500) of at least one
drilling assembly.
Machine according to claim 5, characterised in that it
comprises at least one support (22) mounted pivotably about an

axis perpendicular to the axis of the drill bit (5), capable of
pivoting the piece (A) to be drilled in order to present its two

ends successively to the drill bit (5), and in that it further
comprises at least one fixed non-pivotable support (21) arranged

in alignment with the drill bit (5) and said pivoting support
(22), said fixed support (21) having jaws (23, 24) capable of

adopting a close-together position to maintain the piece (A) to
be drilled in alignment with the bit (5) and a spaced-apart

position to allow pivoting of said piece (A).
Machine according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the supporting means (50, 51) for the piece (A
) to be
drilled are movable transversely relative to the axis of the

drill bit (5, 500), so as to be able to present several different
points of the section of said piece (A) to said bit, for the

purpose of drilling at least two parallel holes.
Machine according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
