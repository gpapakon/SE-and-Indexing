<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve with a flexible tube
defining a flow passage and apparatus to squeeze the tube
and close the flow passage.In chemical industries, the controlling of the flow of
highly corrosive chemicals, such as various acids including
hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and similar materials,
as well as highly corrosive bases such as hydrogen peroxide
and similar materials, continues to be a vexing problem
because leakage of such liquids out of the flow systems at
the valves continues to be a substantial problem. Various
plastic poppet valves have been used and weir valves have
been used, using diaphragms and other all plastic parts, but
prevention of leakage has not been completely accomplished.
Previously known clamp valves, closing a flexible tube, have
not proven reliable in completely closing the flow passage.For example, United States Patent No. 4,523,738
(Raftis, et al.) discloses a deformable sleeve held between
pinching elements so that flow through the deformable sleeve
may be diminished or cut off. Raftis does not disclose a
number of features of the present invention which contribute
to completely closing the flow passage in a reliable manner.A feature of the invention is a valve suitable for
controlling the flow of highly active chemicals and
comprising an elongate distensible and collapsible tubular
valving portion capable of being squeezed and deformed to
close the flow through the flow passage, and wherein the
wall portions of the valving portion comprise a multiplicity
of elongate flexible laminae of plastic film lying one on 
another but free of each other for relative movement. The
side edges of the laminae and the wall portions formed
thereby are affixed together as by welding and define
outwardly protruding side ribs or vanes. The laminae are
highly flexible to open a flow passage between certain of
the laminae. Another feature of the invention comprises the
collapsible tubular valving portion as described and welded
at its opposite ends to stiff plastic tubular end portions
or connector pipes for connection to other flow ducts and
also functioning to maintain the ends of the collapsing
valving portion open.The valve element and connector pipes may be made of a
fluoropolymer which is highly resistant to the deteriorating
effects of strong chemicals and which do not have
significant elastomeric properties. The laminae of plastic
film need only flex slightly in the ordinary operation of
this valve and are not prone to rapid deterioration due to
wear. Typical of
