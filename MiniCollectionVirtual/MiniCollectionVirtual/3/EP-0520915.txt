<ABSTRACT>
It consists of a plate (7, 8) comprising at least one arched boss (7a, 8a) which is engaged with slight friction in a slot (2h, 3h) of the same shape made in the outer flange (2a, 3a) of the forked end of one of the two elements, and which is extended by a rib (7b, 8b) which is shorter than the boss (7a, 8a) in order to penetrate with longitudinal clearance into a slot of the same shape (2'i, 3'i) made in the tenon (2'b, 3'b), of the second element (1') engaging in the forked end of the first (1), the said rib (7b, 8b) being provided with means for locking it to the inner flange of the forked end of the corresponding element such that it can be dismantled.

Articulated support for flexible supply ducts, 
of the type formed by a chain of which each link (1) 

comprises two longitudinal webs (2, 3) shaped to be 
fitted by a rotary spindle (6) to the webs of an 

adjacent link (1'), while an angular limiting device 
is provided on a level with each spindle (6), said 

device being formed by a detachable lateral plate (7, 
8) provided with raised portions which are inserted 

with some clearance into the curved apertures provided 
in the webs of the links, 

characterised in that one of the ends of each of the 
webs (2, 3) has a bifurcated configuration in order to 

define two parallel flanges (2
a
, 3
a
) between which the 
opposite tenon-shaped end (2
b
, 3
b
) of the adjacent 
link (1') engages, while each raised portion of each 

of the plates (7, 8) of the angular limiting device 
has, offset parallel to the rotary spindle (6), from 

the outside to the inside: 

a curved boss (7
a
, 8
a
) which occupies the 
whole surface of the curved aperture (2
h
, 3
h
) provided  
 

in the outwardly turned flange (2
a
, 3
a
), in order to 
block the intended plate angularly and hence render 

the chain rigid; 
a rib (7
b
, 8
b
) which only occupies one 
single portion of the curved apertures (2
i
, 3
i
) 
provided in the tenon (2
b
, 3
b
), in order to limit the 
rotary amplitude of the links; 
and an end teat (7
c
, 8
c
) which is capable of 
being clipped into a hole (2
i
, 3
i
) in the internal 
flange, in order to ensure that the plate (7, 8) is 

held in place and to render the assembly rigid. 
Support according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the rotary spindle (6) is independent of the 

corresponding plate (7, 8) and is held in place 
axially by its end being clipped into a hole (2
c
, 3
c
) 
provided in the tenon (2
b
, 3
b
) of the intended flange.
