<ABSTRACT>
Perchloroethylene and hydrogen chloride are made by non-catalytic thermal 
chlorination of hydrocarbons and/or their partially chlorinated derivatives by r
eacting them with 
chlorine in the presence of hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride as a reactive diluent, under conditions 

which maximize consumption of carbon tetrachloride and minimize the production of heavy ends, 
such as hexachlorobenzene and other tarry products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making perchloroethylene and hydrogen
chloride by noncatalytic thermal chlorination of hydrocarbons or their partially chlorinated
derivatives in the presence of hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride. In particular, it relates to a
process for production of perchloroethylene and hydrogen chloride by the noncatalytic
thermal chlorination of C1 to C3 hydrocarbons and/or their partially chlorinated derivatives in
the presence of hydrogen using carbon tetrachloride as a reactive diluent under conditions
which maximize consumption of carbon tetrachloride supplied to the process from an external
source, while minimizing the production of heavy ends, such as hexachlorobenzene and other
tarry products.When conventionally manufacturing perchloroethylene by chlorination of
hydrocarbons and/or their partially chlorinated derivatives, substantial amounts of carbon
tetrachloride are also obtained. In addition, substantial quantities of undesirable
hexachlorinated products such as hexachloroethane, hexachlorobutadiene and
hexachlorobenzene, hereinafter referred to as heavy ends, are formed. Carbon tetrachloride,
however, is thought to be among the halocarbons which cause destruction of the ozone layer
and is therefore coming to be considered a relatively undesirable byproduct which is finding
fewer and fewer commercial uses. More particularly, demand for it as a feedstock in
producing fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, which previously provided an important
market for carbon tetrachloride, has greatly decreased because of the environmentally 
deleterious nature of such chlorofluorocarbons. Because of the undesirable environmental
attributes of carbon tetrachloride and products made therefrom, regulations governing the
production and use of carbon tetrachloride are expected to result in a major decrease in the
demand for carbon tetrachloride over the next decade. On the other hand, the more
ecologically benign chlorinated hydrocarbons, notably perchloroethylene, are expected to
remain in high demand because of their many practical uses, both as a solvent and as a
starting material for the production of other chemicals. The present invention addresses this
situation by providing a process for the production of perchloroethylene that consumes
carbon tetrachloride and minimizes formation of heavy ends.Direct thermal chlorination of methane, ethane, propane, ethylene, propylene,
or their partially chlorinated derivatives exemplifies a conventional process for
perchloroethylene
