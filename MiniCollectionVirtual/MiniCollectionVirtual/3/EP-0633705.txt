<ABSTRACT>
A dual frequency cellular radiotelephone system, having different 
service providers and serving mobile subscribers at first and second distinct 

frequency ranges, uses frequency conversion techniques, to serve both frequency 
ranges with a minimum of equipment duplication. A first service group is serviced 

by a first system including a mobile switching center (101), a first transmission unit 
(103), a first base station controller (102), a first base transceiver (104), a first linear 

amplifier (105) and first antenna (106). The entire train of components is designed to 
support air interface transmissions at the first frequency band at which the first group 

is served. A signal frequency converter (222), connected to the transceiver (104) of 
the first frequency band, converts downlink signals from the first frequency range to 

the second frequency range and uplink signals from the second frequency range to 
the first frequency range. Signals transmitted by the second antenna (216) are within 

the second band of frequencies and signals received at the second band of 
frequencies are converted to signals within the first band of frequencies so that they 

may be processed by the first radio telephone system of the first frequency band. 
Mobile stations (107,117) are identified by the subscriber group identification 

register (225) for their subscriber group enabling distinct services and distinct 
system parameters. Information concerning each mobile station of the first and 

second subscriber groups is obtained from the first and second subscriber 
information register databases (211,221).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-band cellular radiotelephone systems in
which the different bands are dedicated to different service providers, see also WO-A-92 13400.Radiotelephone cellular service areas are typically divided among two
or more service providers. Each service provider operates within a distinct frequency
band which is unique to its customers. An example is the division of serving areas
into two distinct frequency bands 800 MHz and 1.5 GHz serving two distinct groups
of subscribers (e.g. PDC Personal Digital Cellular, a Japanese standard). Another
examples is GSM (i.e. Groupe Speciale Mobile, a European Standard). These
separate groups of subscribers may be served by a commonly owned but using
separate and independent equipment bases to provide service area call processing
and air interface service. In most cases each group of subscribers is served by a
different service provider. Such is the case in Japan where different service
providers serve different subscriber groups at different frequencies as presently
allowed by the controlling digital cellular standards (PDC) in Japan.As presently contemplated, by PDC, the cellular system serving each
band is constructed and designed for only one band of frequency. The provision of
service in each of the two bands hence requires the provision of separate and distinct
mobile switching centers, base station controllers and radio transceiver units due to
the division of the serving frequencies. The different services are reflected only in
frequency since they both share common call processing arrangements and
protocols. This requires the duplication of equipment whose only distinct feature is
to function at two widely disparate frequencies.A dual frequency cellular radiotelephone system, with a common
provider serving two different subscriber groups or having different service
providers, serving mobile subscribers at first and second distinct frequency ranges,
uses front end frequency conversion techniques, to serve both frequency ranges with
a minimum of equipment duplication. A first service group is serviced by a first
system including a mobile switching center (MSC), a first base station controller
(BSC), first transmission equipment, first radio transceiver equipment, a first linear
amplifier and a first antenna. This entire train of components is designed to support
air interface transmission and reception at the first frequency band at which the first
group is served. In accord with one aspect of the invention a dual frequency cellular
radio
