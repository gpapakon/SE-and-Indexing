<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a specific prostaglandin
analogue.EP-A-0 073 397 generally discloses prostaglandin C-9 enol
acylates. However, this reference does not disclose the
specific prostaglandin analogue of the present invention.EP-A-0 150 732 discloses prostaglandin emulsion compositions.
This reference does not disclose a prostaglandin analogue
having a propylcarbonyloxy group attached in 9-position of a
PGE, Structure.For prostaglandins (hereinafter referred to as PG),
six structures i.e. PGE1, PGE2, PGE3, PGF1α, PGF2α and
PGF3α, were determined in 1960. Since then, PG analogues
have been discovered one after another, and their
physiological activities have been gradually known.For example, methyl 9-acetoxy-11α,15S-dihydroxyprosta-8,13E-diene-1-oate
of the formula (A),
methyl 9,11α,15S-triacetoxyprosta-8,13E-diene-1-oate of
the formula (B), methyl 9,15R-diacetoxy-11α-hydroxyprosta-8,13E-diene-1-oate
of the formula (C) and
9,15S-diacetoxy-11α-hydroxyprosta-8,13-E-diene-1-oate of
the formula (D) may be mentioned (U.S. Patent 4,363,817).
On the other hand, another literature predicts an
important role which PGs will play as drugs in future and
proposes that since PGs are typical local hormones which
are produced locally as required and which act locally,
it is necessary for such PG-related drugs to develop a
drug delivery system taking into consideration the
chemical properties and characteristics as autacoid. If
a conventional general systemic administration method is
employed, the effects are weak, and systemic side effects
appear rather strongly. Therefore, it has been proposed
to use lipid microspheres (hereinafter referred to as LM)
as a carrier in the drug delivery system for PGs. 
However, such LM is believed to be emulsified fine
particles of lipid containing PG.Namely, it has been reported that the stability in
vivo is increased by formulating PGE1 into an emulsion of
lipid containing PGE1 as a target treating drug having
PGE1 encapsulated in LM having a diameter of 0.2 µm, and
the formulated drug shows a vasodilator activity and
platelet aggregation inhibiting activity stronger than
PGE1 alone (Sim, A.K., et al, Arznein-Forsch/Drug Res.,
1206-1209, 1986).Further, it has been reported that when the PGE1-containing
lipid emulsion is administered to a vital
body, a substantial amount of PGE1 is freed from LM, and
a study has been made to control the amount to be freed
(Rie Igarashi et al, Ensho, 8, (3), 243-246 (1988).In the report, it is reported that with respect to
the methyl ester,

A prostaglandin analogue of the following formula:


namely butyl 9-butyryloxy-11α,15S-dihydroxyprosta-8,13E-diene-1-oate.
A process for preparing the prostaglandin analogue of claim
1, characterized in that (1E,3S)-1-iodo-3-(t-butyldimethylsiloxy)-1-octene

is reacted with an alkyl lithium to obtain the
corresponding 1-lithio octene which is then reacted with a

tri-alkylphosphine-copper(I) iodide complex to obtain the corresponding
organolithiocuprate, whcih is then reacted with

4R-t-butyldimethylsiloxy-2-(6-carbobutoxyhexyl)-2-cyclopentene-1-one
and then the reaction mixture is quenched with

butyric anhydride.
