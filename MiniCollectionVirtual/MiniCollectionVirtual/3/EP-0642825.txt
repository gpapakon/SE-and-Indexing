<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to improved microporous 
and ultra-filtration polysulfone membranes. More 
specifically, it relates polysulfone membranes which 
incorporate certain protein resistant, hydrophilic 
polyurethane polymers. In addition to improving the 
biocompatibility of the polysulfone membrane, these 
polymers also exhibit greatly improved resistance to 
degradation by bleach. Polysulfone membranes are known in the art in 
both flat sheet and hollow fiber forms. These 
membranes have a wide variety of uses, including 
desalination by reverse osmosis, dialysis, and protein 
separations. A major drawback of using membranes for 
concentration or fractionation of proteins in 
biotechnology downstream separation processes is the 
adsorption of protein molecule solutes on the membrane 
surface. This has an important impact on the flux 
decline, usually called "membrane fouling", and the 
performance characteristics of the membrane change 
with operating time. As a consequence, the separation 
process design becomes more difficult to optimize and 
sometimes requires complex operation modes. The 
easiest way to overcome this problem is to employ a 
protein non-adsorptive membrane. Substantially protein non-adsorptive polysulfone 
microporous membranes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
5,096,585, issued to Nguyen March 17, 1992, and  
 
incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in 
full. Membranes made according to that reference have 
high burst strength, high flux and low protein 
adsorption characteristics suitable for applications 
to biotechnology, including dialysis. An added 
feature which would enhance the usefulness of these 
membranes would be reusability. Multiple hypochlorite 
(bleach) washes are used for cleaning such membranes 
and their associated equipment. Other oxidizers such 
as hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, or mixtures 
thereof, are also used. The membranes do not hold up 
well to such treatment. As a consequence, their use 
has thus far been limited to single applications or 
multiple applications where alternative protocols have 
been established. It has now been found that if such 
membranes are made by incorporating certain 
hydrophilic polymer formulations, the composite 
membranes exhibit enhanced resistance to bleach. 
Resistance to bleach is desirable as it extends the 
useable lifetime of the membranes. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
prepare a substantially protein non-adsorptive 
polysulfone membrane which is also resistant to 
bleach. It is
