<ABSTRACT>
In order to monitor the space at the rear of the vehicle and, simultaneously, the corresponding monitoring device which acts, via a circuit (10), on the drive motor and is in the form of a sensor, use is made of a reflex sensor (8) or optoelectronic proximity switch which, when it fails, switches off the tailgate (6).

<CLAIMS>
Motor vehicle (1) with a monitoring device (2) for the rear of the vehicle, which 
device comprises a switching circuit for switching off the drive motor with an 

integrated sensor (8, 11-12) and also a circuit (10) monitoring the function of the 
sensor (8, 11-12, 17-18) and restricting the range of action of the motor vehicle 

(1) if the sensor (8, 11-12) fails, 
characterised in that
 the sensor 
(8) is a reflex sensor (8) designed as an optoelectronic proximity switch, and the 

circuit (10) monitors voltage in the reflex sensor (8) with respect to a threshold 
value and, when the voltage is not close or cannot be determined it blocks an 

accessory hydraulic or mechanical system of the motor vehicle (1), preferably that 
of a loading platform (6). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 one or a 
plurality of infrared sensors (11) or ultrasonic sensors (12) are disposed on the 

tail (3) of the vehicle next to one or several of the reflex sensors (8). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the circuit 
(10) is designed as a fail-safe circuit. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the reflex 
sensor (8) and/or the infrared sensor (11) are pivotable on the tail (3) of the 

vehicle. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the lines 
of the reflex sensor (8), the infrared sensor (11) and the circuit (10) are fitted with 

moulded plugs. 
Motor vehicle according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the reflex 
sensor (8) has a pivot drive which is of a program-controlled type.  

 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the 
infrared sensors (11) or ultrasonic sensors (12) are replaced by or supplemented 

by photoelectric barriers (13, 14). 
Motor vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the reflex 
sensor (8) is fitted with a potentiometer (15).
