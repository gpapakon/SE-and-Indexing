<ABSTRACT>
An endless chain (1) provided with groups of cutter 
elements (A-J) thereon, for cutting a ditch in the ground, the 

cutter elements (A-J) of each group, together being arranged to 
cut the ground throughout the width of the ditch. In 

excavating a ditch the cutter is advanced horizontally at a 
rate such that in the time the chain has moved a distance 

corresponding to the length of one group of cutter 
elements, the cutter has moved horizontally by less than 

the distance by which the cutter bits project from a base 
plate of the cutter element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an endless chain type
cutter for excavating a ditch in the ground for use when
constructing an underground continuous wall in civil
engineering works.Previously, in order to construct an underground
continuous wall, it was necessary to excavate an elliptical
hole, 2 or 3m (6 or 10 feet) wide, down to a predetermined
depth from the ground surface, or to drill into the ground
with an auger drill with double or triple lanes down to a
predetermined depth, and then to insert a reinforcement
cage or steel members. Finally, cement was poured into the
hole, or ready mixed concrete was cast in the hole. By
repeating this process with successive holes intercepting
preceding ones, a continuous underground wall could be
constructed.In the prior method for constructing an underground
continuous wall described above, there are some problems as
follows. Since the machinery for excavating the holes is
about 30m (100 feet) tall, there is a danger that it may
fall over. Secondly, the construction process is
complicated, so the construction period is prolonged.
Also, a film of muddy water, bentonite or the like is
formed where one hole intercepts the preceding section of
wall, so a perfect joint cannot be made in order to form a
continuous wall. Underground water may leak through the 
joints after completion of the works. It is therefore
difficult to attain simultaneously the objectives of safely
and rapidly constructing a wall in the ground which is also
perfectly continuous.Because of these problems, a method of making an
underground continuous wall as shown in the schematic views
of Figs. 8 and 9 has been tried. In this method an endless
chain type cutter c is disposed on one side of a self-propelled
vehicle b having crawler tracks a. A continuous
ditch is excavated in the ground by advancing the self-propelled
vehicle b in the direction of the arrow A of
Figs.8 and 9 while driving the cutter c. Then cement or
concrete is poured into the ditch.In the endless chain cutter c mentioned above, an
endless chain f is spanned between upper and lower chain
sprockets d and e and groups of cutter elements are
disposed protrudingly on the outer side of this chain f at
predetermined intervals. Within each group of cutter
elements, cutter bits g1 - g9 are arranged on base plates
h, attached to the chain f, for example as shown in Fig.
10.When the chain cutter having cutter bits g1 - g9 as
shown in Fig. 10 is advanced in the direction of the arrow
A in Figs. 8, 9 the sprockets d and e are rotated to

<CLAIMS>
An endless chain type cutter having an endless
chain (1) extending between upper and lower sprockets (d,

e) and at least one group of cutter elements (A-J)
thereon for use in cutting, in the ground, a ditch of

pre-determined width (K), each cutter element (A-J)
having at least one projecting cutter bit (4),

characterised by the cutter bits (4) of the cutter
elements (A-J) of each group, together, being arranged to

cut the ground continuously across the entire width (K)
between the laterally outermost cutter bits (4) of the

group of cutter elements, so that no part of the ground
across the width of the ditch remains uncut by a cutter

bit. 
An endless chain type cutter according to claim 1,
wherein at least one cutter element (E,J) of each group

includes a bucket.
An endless chain type cutter according to claim 2,
wherein the or each bucket (5) has at least one cutter bit

(4) projecting therefrom.
An endless chain type cutter according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein each group includes cutter

elements (A-D,F-I) which have a plurality of cutter bits
(4) projecting from a base plate (2) which is attached to

the chain (1).
An endless chain type cutter according to claim 4,
wherein at least some cutter elements (A-D,F-I) include 

cutter bits (4) which project from the base plate (2)
outwards beyond the edge of the base plate.
Apparatus for excavating a ditch including a vehicle
(b), such as a tracked vehicle with an endless chain type

cutter according to any of the preceding claims mounted
thereon.
A method of excavating a ditch using an endless chain
type cutter according to any one of claim 1 to 5 or

apparatus according to claim 6 wherein, in a time in which
the endless chain (1) moves along its path between the

upper and lower sprockets (d,e) by a distance corresponding
to the length (L) of a said group of cutter elements (A-J),

the endless chain is advanced along the ditch being cut by
a distance (M) which is less than the distance (N,O) by

which the cutter elements project from the chain.
A method of constructing a continuous underground wall
by excavating a ditch according to the method of claim 7,

and pouring cement or concrete therein.
