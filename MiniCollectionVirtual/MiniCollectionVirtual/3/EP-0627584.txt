<ABSTRACT>
A valve for regulating the flow of a liquid, for example in liquid chromatography, 
comprises a valve seat and a valve ball which are made of electrically 

conductive ceramic or glass material. Due to the electric conductivity, 
electrostatic charging is avoided which would otherwise attract dirt particles 

and lead to contamination and leakage of the valve. The valve is chemically 
inert and is not corroded by the solvents typically used in analytical chemistry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a valve for regulating the flow of a liquid, with at 
least a closure member, for example a valve ball, and a coacting valve seat. Such 
valves are used, for example, in pumps for analytical measuring instruments 
such as liquid chromatographs. Liquid pumps in use with analytical measuring instruments require a high flow 
accuracy. In order to meet this requirement the pumps must be equipped with 
precision valves. Usually ball and seat type valves are used. Passive valves, 
wherein the valve ball is lifted by the flow of liquid, are known, for example, 
from US-A-3 810 716 or from US-A-4 139 469. The valve balls are often 
made of ruby and the seat of sapphire. Valves, wherein the ball and seat are 
composed of aluminum oxide ceramics (Al2O3), are also known. Such ceramic 
valves are described in US-4 832 075 or in US-A-4 862 907 or in US-A-5 
002 662. These ceramic valves produced by the die-pressing method have 
economic and other advantages over ruby/sapphire valves. Both the ruby/sapphire and the Al2O3-ceramic/Al2O3-ceramic combinations have 
considerable advantages in use with a pump for high-pressure liquid 
chromatography. These advantages are: resistance to wear, chemical 
resistance to commonly used solvents, accuracy of form for good sealing 
properties, a high machining quality at economically efficient manufacturing 
costs. In high-pressure liquid chromatography it is possible, especially where 
ruby/sapphire valves are being used, that under the influence of acetonitrile 
and water a coating of organic substances forms on the valve material. As 
a result of this coating the ball will adhere to the seat and the surface of the 
seat will become contaminated. This problem can be reduced by using Al2O3 
ceramics instead of ruby or sapphire.  
 Besides the mentioned passive valves, active valves may also be used in 
pumps for analytical measuring instruments, wherein the valve ball can be 
activated by a valve actuator. Such an active valve is known from EP-A-0 
328 696. Active valves have the advantage that no flow reversal is required 
to close the valve. Further, movement of the valve elements is largely 
independent of external influences. Either ceramics or ruby/sapphire can be 
used as materials for the ball and seat. The disadvantage of the valves as described above is their great tendency to 
become dirty. In particular in high-pressure liquid chromatography, it is 
impossible to avoid that smallest particles of dirt are deposited. These 
particles either
