<ABSTRACT>
A mixture of N-propyl-N-[2-(2,4,6-trichlorophenoxy)ethyl]imidazole-1-carboxamide (= prochloraz) or of a salt or metal complex thereof, and 4-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-N-phenyl-2-pyrimidineamine (= cyprodinil) or a salt or a metal complex thereof, leads to a synergistically enhanced activity in the control of plant diseases. Such compositions are particularly suitable for controlling plant diseases in cereals. The two active substances can also be applied to the crops individually, one immediately after the other.
