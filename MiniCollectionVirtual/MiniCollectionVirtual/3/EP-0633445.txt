<ABSTRACT>
A high temperature heat exchanger having an 
improved support apparatus for suspending a tube bundle (20). 

The improved support comprises a skirt (50) from which the 
tube sheet and the bundle are supported, and a lip (48) on an 

upper end of the skirt (50) engaged in a flange assembly (16) 
receiving the lip (48). A first refractory lining (68) on an 

inside face of the skirt extends downwardly from the 

lip (48), and overlaps a second refractory lining (70) on an 
outside surface of the skirt (50) extending upwardly from 

adjacent the tube sheet toward the lip. By securing the 
support apparatus in the cold flange assembly, the 

interior refractory is not used for supporting the tube 
bundle and can maintain its integrity, have a lower 

incidence of premature failure and yield an optimum 
refractory life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
high temperature heat exchanger
comprising the features
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a heat exchanger is known, for example,
from US-A-4 221 763.
The invention also relates to a method for
supporting a tube bundle in a high-temperature,
refractory-lined heat exchanger.The prior art tube bundles of high temperature heat
exchangers have typically been secured to interior
refractory material, adding stress to the refractory
material, causing premature refractory failure and
expensive repair of the refractory material and tube
bundle. Designing support structures for tube bundles
in high temperature heat exchangers, including reforming
reactors, has been and continues to be a major problem.
Support structures for use inside high temperature
vessels must withstand excessively high temperatures and
weight stresses while supporting a variety of components 
including baffles, catalyst tubes, diffusion plates and
other components in extremely harsh environments.The prior art support structures in reforming
exchangers include attachment directly into the
refractory material which lines the interior surface of
catalytic reactors. The refractory material covers and
protects the interior surface of the catalytic reactor
from the high temperatures generated within the reactor
and prevents "hot spots," i.e., excessive amounts of
heat from reaching and possibly causing failure of the
reactor walls. The refractory material can be of
varying thicknesses and components, but is typically a
ceramic or cement-like material which is heat resistant.
Refractory material is brittle and does not adequately
support interior components which may expand or contract
due to the wide temperature variations.Refractory material thus has a limited life
expectancy under optimum conditions. Given the
additional stresses of supporting internal components,
the refractory material tends to break loose at an
accelerated rate, increasing the frequency of costly
repair and interrupting the operation of the exchanger.
Moreover, the internal support structures supported by
refractory in prior art reactors are typically
constructed of various metallic alloys. When the
temperatures change from cool to hot to cool again,
these support structures can damage refractory during
the thermal expansion and contraction cycles. USP 4,221,763 discloses a high temperature reactor device having a pressure
shell lined with refractory and a plurality of tubes supported by a tube sheet.
The tube sheet is formed with a
