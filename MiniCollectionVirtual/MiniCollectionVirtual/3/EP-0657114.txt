<ABSTRACT>
In a ski-boot comprising a rigid shell (22), a boot leg (24) hinged to 
the shell (22) and an inner shoe (122) there is a padding (26) connected 

to the inside rear part of the boot leg (24) by connecting means (28,30) 
which allow the padding (26) to move between two limit positions, 

respectively lowered and pulled up one, and there is also a 
longitudinally slidable tongue (132) interposed between the shell (22) 

and the inner shoe (122) to cover a front opening (128) made in the inner

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ski-boot of the type comprising a
rigid shell and a boot leg hinged to the shell and having the function to
wrap the lower portion of the skier's leg allowing the leg to bend. An
inner lining shoe is housed inside the shell and the boot leg in order to
make more comfortable the fit of the boot-ski avoiding any direct contact
between the foot, on one side, and the rigid shell and boot leg, on the
other side; furthermore, the inner shoe wraps the foot remaining in a
close contact with the shell in order to transmit the control movements
of the skier's foot to the ski.In particular, the ski-boot is of the central-entry type whereby, in
order to put the foot on it is required the backward displacement of a
part of the boot leg. In order to facilitate the entry of the foot into
the ski-boot, the inner lining shoe is of the central-entry type, namely
it has a vertical opening extending along its rear part from the top end
of the upper up to the sole area.Furthermore, there is an inner padding, rigidly connected to the top end
of the boot leg, to cover the opening of the inner shoe and thus
completely wrapping the lower portion of the leg.However, these embodiments have various drawbacks in that the fact that
calves may be and are of various sizes is not taken account. In
particular, for legs having small calves, once the latching levers of the
shell are tightened, the tightening of the boot leg around the leg is not
effective; vice versa, for legs having big calves the tightening
operation is difficult and furthermore, a poorly comfortable fit is
obtained.Finally, both the shell and the boot leg have, in their front part, two
opposite edges defining a longitudinal front opening extending from the
toe portion of the ski-boot in order to allow the foot to enter into the
ski-boot and then into the inner shoe.The ski-boots according to the prior art have a tongue firmly fastened at
one of its ends to the inner shoe to cover the opening. In order to
further facilitate the entry of the foot into the ski-boot, the distance
between the shell portion in contact with the instep and the shell
portion apt to house the heel must be much greater than the distance
between the instep and the heel; in this case the contact between the
shell and the instep is ensured by suitably fastening the shell round the 
inner shoe.Owing to the non-rigidity of the inner shoe and to the pre-existent
clearance between the foot and the shell at the instep, the transmission
of the foot control movements to

<CLAIMS>
Ski-boot of the type comprising a rigid shell (22), a boot leg (24) hinged on
the shell (22), a padding (26) connected to the inside rear part of the boot leg (24)

and an inner lining shoe (122), said shell (22) and said boot leg (24) having, in the
front part, two opposite edges (124a, 124b and 126a, 126b) defining a longitudinal

opening (128) which extends from the toe portion (114) of the ski-boot (20),

   characterized in that

said padding (26) is interposed, at the opening of the inner shoe (122), between the
boot leg (24) and the inner lining shoe (122), and is fixed to the boot leg (24) by

connecting means (28, 30, 34) which allow said inner padding (26) to be moved
between two limit positions with reference to the top edge of the boot leg (24),

respectively a lowered position wherein it is in contact with the adjacent inner
surface of the boot leg and a pulled up position wherein it is detached from said

inner surface,

and in that
the ski-boot comprises a tongue (132) interposed between the inner shoe (122), the
edges (124a, 124b) of the shell (22) and the edges (126a, 126b) of the boot leg

(24), to cover the longitudinal opening (128), said tongue being connected to the
shell (22) via connecting means (136, 138; 140, 142) so as to slide longitudinally

with respect to the shell for a predetermined distance.
Ski-boot according to claim 1, characterized in that there is, at
least, one int
ermediate position between said two limit positions to stop
said padding (26).
Ski-boot according to any one of the previous claims, characterized in
that said connecting means (28,30) comprise at least one pin (28) fixed

to one of said boot leg (24) and padding (26) and slidable in a
