<ABSTRACT>
A glycolic acid ester is produced by hydrogenating 
an oxalic acid diester of the formula, (COOR)₂, wherein R 

is a C₁₋₆ alkyl group, with hydrogen in the presence of a 
solid catalyst comprising, for example, copper and silver 

metals carried on a solid carrier, and in the additional 
presence of an aliphatic alcohol, and collecting the 

resultant glycolic acid ester from the reaction mixture 
by distillation, preferably in the presence of an ester 

of a C₃₋₁₂ dicarboxylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing a glycolic acid ester. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a method of producing a glycolic acid ester by 
a catalytic hydrogenation of an oxalic acid diester with 
a high selectivity and with a high yield. The glycolic acid esters are significantly 
useful as a material for cleaning agent for a boiler and 
the like, an additive for plating, an etching agent and 
an tanning agent for leather and an intermediate for 
preparing detergent builders and for biodegradable 
polymers. As a method for producing a glycolic acid 
ester, a catalytic reaction method of an oxalic acid 
diester, for example, diethyl oxalate with hydrogen in 
the presence of a catalyst is known from, for example, 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) 
No. 55-42971, U.S. Patent No. 4,112,245, and German 
Patent No. 459,603. The method as disclosed in those 
publications is disadvantageous in that since the 
reaction is a successive reaction, if the catalyst used 
and the reaction conditions applied are not optimum, the 
reaction proceeds excessively so that an undesirable 
ethylene glycol is produced as a by-product and thus the 
selectivity of the aimed glycolic acid ester is reduced. 
Also, the by-product causes the isolation and collection 
of the aimed glycolic acid ester to be complicated. To solve the above-mentioned problem, for 
example, in GB-B-2,031,883, it was attempted to 
catalytically react an oxalic acid diester with hydrogen 
in the presence of a catalyst comprising at least one  
 
member selected from ruthenium, nickel and Raney nickel 
under specific reaction conditions. By this method, a 
reaction product comprising one of ethylene glycol and 
glycolic acid ester in a relatively large amount is 
obtained. However, to industrially produce glycolic acid 
ester, the above-mentioned method must be improved so 
that the reaction rate is enhanced and the selectivity of 
glycolic acid ester is increased. Also, it is necessary 
that a cheap catalyst is allowed to be used and the 
reaction conditions are made mild. U.S. Patent No. 4,585,890 discloses a catalyst, 
in which an ammine complex of copper is carried on a 
silica carrier, for the catalytic reaction. Also, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,409,395 discloses a catalyst in which silver 
or palladium is carried on a carrier, for the catalytic 
reaction. However, those catalysts are unsatisfactory in 
that the catalytic activity of the catalysts and the 
resultant selectivity of glycolic acid ester are
