<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides novel compounds, and 
methods of their manufacture, such compounds are generally 
pharmacologically useful as agents in obstetric and gynecologic therapy. 
The aforementioned pharmacologic activities are useful in the treatment 
of mammals. More specifically, the compounds of the present invention 
can be used in the treatment of preterm labor, stopping labor preparatory 
to Cesarean delivery, and in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. At the 
present time, there is a need in the area of obstetric and gynecologic 
therapy for such agents. In the field of obstetrics, one of the most important problems 
is the management of preterm labor. A significant number of the 
pregnancies progressing past 20 weeks of gestation experience premature 
labor and delivery, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and 
mortality. Despite major advances in neonatal care, retention of the fetus 
in utero is preferred in most instances. Tocolytic (uterine-relaxing) agents that are currently in use 
include β₂-adrenergic agonists, magnesium sulfate and ethanol. 
Ritodrine, the leading β₂-adrenergic agonist, causes a number of 
cardiovascular and metabolic side effects in the mother, including 
tachycardia, increased renin secretion, hyperglycemia (and reactive 
hypoglycemia in the infant). Other β₂-adrenergic agonists, including 
terbutaline and albuterol have side effects similar to those of ritodrine. 
Magnesium sulfate at plasma concentrations above the therapeutic range 
of 4 to 8 mg/dL can cause inhibition of cardiac conduction and 
neuromuscular transmission, respiratory depression and cardiac arrest, 
thus making this agent unsuitable when renal function is impaired. 
Ethanol is as effective as ritodrine in preventing premature labor, but it  
 
does not produce a corresponding reduction in the incidence of fetal 
respiratory distress that administration of ritodrine does. It has been proposed that a selective oxytocin antagonist 
would be the ideal tocolytic agent. In the last few years, evidence has 
accumulated to strongly suggest that the hormone oxytocin is the 
physiological initiator of labor in several mammalian species including 
humans. Oxytocin is believed to exert this effect in part by directly 
contracting the uterine myometrium and in part by enhancing the 
synthesis and release of contractile prostaglandins from the uterine 
endometrium/decidua. These prostaglandins may, in addition, be 
important in the cervical ripening process. By these mechanisms, the 
process of
