<ABSTRACT>
A physiologically active substance fixed sheet (1) 
(hereinafter the "sheet") comprising a water-insoluble 

base material (2) and a physiologically active substance fixed 
layer (3) comprised of a water-soluble resin and a 

physiologically active substance fixed through the water-soluble 
resin, formed on the surface of the base material 

all over or in part. The sheet has advantages that, when 
it is immersed in an aqueous medium such as a buffer 

solution, an aqueous solution of the physiologically 
active substance can be obtained in a short time, and also 

any constituents of the base material do not mix into the 
aqueous solution. Thus, the sheet can be used for various 

examinations including clinical examination. Moreover, in 
this sheet, the physiologically active substance is fixed 

on the base material through the water-soluble resin, and 
hence any containers for holding physiologically active 

substances are unnecessary and the substances can be 
weighed with more ease when used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a physiologically active 
substance fixed sheet in which physiologically active 
substances such as antibodies, antigens or enzymes have 
been fixed or set stationary, and more particularly to a 
physiologically active substance fixed sheet utilized in 
various examinations including clinical examinations. It 
also relates to a process for its production, a method for 
its storage and a method of supplying a physiologically 
active substance through such a physiologically active 
substance fixed sheet. In recent years, with progress of techniques for the 
preparation of monoclonal antibodies, immunological 
measures have been conventionally used in the screening of 
various diseases such as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome) and hepatitis. There are various reagents used 
for such examination, among which reagents for all sorts  
 
of physiologically active substances such as antigens, 
antibodies and enzymes are indispensable. As means for circulating these reagents in a stable 
state, it has been common to use a method in which 
reagents are freeze-dried and formed into powders, or a 
method in which reagents are dissolved or suspended in 
buffers or in solutions containing protective materials 
and the resulting solutions or suspensions are 
refrigerated or freezed for their circulation. These methods, however, require containers made of 
glass or the like. Such containers are of no further use 
once used, and are discarded. Since the containers 
themselves are expensive, these methods have been involved 
in economical disadvantages. Use of such containers also 
has brought about a disadvantage that space must be left 
for storage during circulation or before use. Reagents supplied in this way are weighed when used, 
and put into use for experiments, examinations and so 
forth. In the case of freeze-dried powdery reagents, 
however, much labor must be taken for weighing the 
reagents, and also such reagents tend to remain in 
containers, having a disadvantage that they can be 
wastefull as they do. Under such technical circumstances, there is a 
disclosure as to a method in which substances or materials  
 
having physiological activities are held in the form of a 
film or sheet so that they can be made easier to handle 
and are available without use of the containers (see U.S. 
Patent No. 5,098,893 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 5-124954). More specifically, U.S. Patent No. 5,098,893 
discloses a method for storage of materials in a 
composition
