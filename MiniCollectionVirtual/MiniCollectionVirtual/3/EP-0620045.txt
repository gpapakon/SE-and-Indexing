<ABSTRACT>
Electrostatic spray device. It contains a tube-like spray body (3), at least one charging electrode (12) for transmitting electrostatic charges to the powder, at least one counter-electrode (44) which is arranged in the vicinity of the charging electrode (12) and is connected to a different electric potential (20) to the charging electrode (12) so that it receives at least some of the free ions generated during electric charging of the powder, at least one annular body (44; 68; 74) which forms or bears the counter-electrode (44; 64; 74, 76) and extends around the downstream section (72) of the spray body (3), on which it is supported radially, at least one connection web (78) outside the spray body (3) which bears at its downstream end (79) the annular body (74) and is fastened with its upstream end on the spray body (3), and an electric connection through the connection web (78) between an electric potential connection (20) and the counter-electrode (44).

An electrostatic spray apparatus for the electrostatic spray
coating of articles with powder, which has the following features:


a tubular spray body (3); at least one charging electrode (12) at
the downstream end portion (72) of the spray body (3) for the

transmission of electrostatic charges to the powder; the charging
electrode (12) has an electrical potential which is different from the

electrical potential of the article to be coated in such a way that the
charged powder is electrostatically attracted by the article; at least

one counter-electrode (44; 64; 74, 76) which is arranged in the
proximity of the charging electrode (12) at the downstream end portion

(72) of the spray body (3) and which is connected by way of an
electrical connecting means (22, 84, 91) to a different electrical

potential (20) from the charging electrode (12) so that it receives at
least a part of the free ions produced upon electrostatic charging of

the powder; and at least one annular body (44; 68; 74) which forms or
carries the counter-electrode (44; 64; 74, 76) and which extends around

the downstream end portion (72) of the spray body (3) on which it is
radially supported;

   characterised in that the electrical connecting means (22, 84, 91)
is arranged at the upstream end portion of the spray body (3), that

there is provided at least one connecting bar (78) which extends from
the electrical connecting means (22, 84, 91) at the upstream end portion

of the spray body (3) to the annular body (44; 68; 74) at the downstream
end portion of the spray body (3) outside the spray body (3) and

parallel thereto, that the connecting bar (78) comprises electrically
insulating material and an electrical line (73) extending through the

insulating material, that the downstream end (79) of the connecting bar
(78) carries the annular body (74) and the upstream end of the

connecting bar (78) is releasably fixed to the electrical connecting
means (22, 84, 91) in the proximity of the upstream end of the spray

body (3), wherein the electrical line (73), the electrical connecting
means (22, 84, 91) and the counter-electrode (44; 64; 74, 76) are

electrically connected together.
A spray apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that
the electrically insulating material of the connecting bar (78) is a

tube.
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that a plurality of counter-electrodes (76) in the form

of needle electrodes project out of the annular body (74).
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the spacing (d) between the charging electrode

(12) and the counter-electrode (44; 64, 64/2) is smaller than the
spacing (D) between the charging electrode (12) and the article (4; 6)

to be coated.
A spray apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that
the spacing (d) between the charging electrode (12) and the counter-electrode

(44; 64) is a third to half the spacing (D) between the
charging electrode (12) and the article (4; 6) to be coated.
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that there are provided means (52; 66) by which

compressed air (66) is caused to flow around the counter-electrode (44;
64) in order to keep it free from coating material.
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the counter-electrode (44; 64; 74, 76) is arranged

upstream of the downstream end (26) of the charging electrode (12).
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the counter-electrode (44; 64) is arranged at a

spacing from the atomised powder cloud and that the spacing (d) between
the counter-electrode (44; 64) and the powder cloud is smaller than the

spacing (D) between the charging electrode (12) and the article (4; 6)
to be coated. 
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the counter-electrode (44; 64) is connected to

earth potential.
A spray apparatus according to one of the preceding claims
