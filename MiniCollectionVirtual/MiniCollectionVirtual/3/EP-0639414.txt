<ABSTRACT>
Packing system for rolling-mill stock with a device to increase the 
transfer speed to packaging, of the types involving: 


a continuous transport system of rolling-mill stock transversal with 
respect to their pre-determined cut length (4), with advancement 

stopping means (5) in at least one collecting station (52,53); 
a transfer means for rolling-mill stock with overhead collection (20) 
by means of a suspended rotatable electromagnetic system (21), in 

association with lifting means (22) that remove from below the feeder 
line (4), the said rolling-mill stock (a,b) and raise them above the said 

feeding line (4), to supply them above and/or below the suspended said 
electromagnetic means (21), the said suspended electromagnetic means 

(20-21) oscillating from the said collecting position (53) to above a 
packing zone (3) to put the rolling-mill stock in a packing pocket (30), 
 
characterized by the fact that in front of the said overhead collecting 

means of the rolling-mill stock (20-21), a device is foreseen for the 
formation of more superimposed rolling-mill stock layers by means of 

suspended electromagnetic collecting means, movable upwards (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention has for object a packing plant for rolling-mill
stock according to the preamble of claim 1, with a productivity increasing device.At the present state of technology is known the necessity to pack at
greater speed in an area commonly called a packing zone, metallic
rolling-mill stock, (section bars, bars, plates, etc.) that come from a
rolling-mill plant after being cut into a pre-determined length to form
the respective packages.The formation of rolling-mill stock packages according to the
present invention occurs by means of stratification, that is by
superimposed layers.In some cases it is also necessary to alternatively overturn the
respective layers to carry out self-binding of the package as for
example for the angles (an upright and an overturned layer
respectively of "n" rolling-mill stock and "n-1" rolling-mill stock).One can also verify the necessity of formation of a package of flat
rolling-mill stock of convenient width by means of the advancement of
one rolling-mill stock at a time, for this reason we will hereafter use the
definition "rolling-mill stock/layer of rolling-mill stock", this means
that the layer of rolling-mill stock (in the case of wide plates), can also
be reduced to one.The present invention makes specific reference to packing
systems with suspended rolling-mill stock transfer means, as described
in the italian patent applications S.I.M.A.C. S.p.A. n°UD91A000030 and
n°.UD91A000031.In particular IT-UD91A000030 and IT-UD91A000031, extended as
European Patent Application 92103035.9. (publication EP-A-0503342), 
foresee the use of:
a continuous transporting system of rolling-mill stock transversal
with respect to their predetermined cut length, with advancement
stopping means in at least one collecting station;transfer means of the rolling-mill stock with overhead collection with
a series of suspended rotatable electromagnets, in association with
lifting means that remove from below the feeding line the said rolling-mill
stock and lift them above the said feeding line, to supply them
below or above the said series of suspended electromagnets, the said
series of suspended electromagnets oscillating from the said collecting
position above a packing zone to place the rolling-mill stock in a
packing pocket.The solution of the patent IT-UD91A000031 is however very
advantageous when compared to the solution of the patent IT-UD91A000030
for the fact that in IT-UD91A000031 the suspended transfer
means never interferes below the advancement line (as does IT-UD91A000030
in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A packing plant for rolling-mill stock with a device to increase the
transfer speed of said rolling-mill stock to a packing zone (3),

comprising :

a continuous transport system (4) for moving a rolling-mill stock
layer (a, a'; b; b') transversally with respect to its predetermined cut

length along an advancement line;
a collecting station (2) located before said packing zone (3) in the
advancement direction and provided with advancement stopping means

(53) for stopping the advancement of a rolling-mill stock layer (a, a'; b;
b');
transfer means having overhead collecting means comprising
first suspended rotatable electromagnetic means (21) associated with

lifting means (22) which acts to remove a rolling-mill stock layer (a, a';
b; b') from below said transport system (4) and raising it above said

transport system (4) in order to supply it to below said first suspended
rotatable electromagnetic means (21), said first suspended rotatable

electromagnetic means (21) oscillating from said collecting station (2)
to said packing zone (3) to place a multi-layer of rolling-mill stock in a

packing pocket (30), characterised in that the plant further comprises :
a superimposing station (1) located before said collecting station
(2) in the advancement direction provided with further advancement

stopping means (52) for stopping the advancement of a rolling-mill
stock layer (a, a'; b; b') at said superimposing station (1); and
a device arranged before said overhead collecting means
comprising further suspended electromagnetic collecting means (10)

located at said superimposing station (1) and movable upwards and

downwards for superimposing a preceding rolling-mill stock layer (a;b) 
on the top of a subsequent one (a'; b'); whereby


(a) said advancement stopping means (52,53) acts to simultaneously
stop the advancement of a first rolling-mill stock layer (a; b) at said

superimposing station (1) below said second suspended electromagnetic
collecting means (10) and the advancement of an already formed multi-layer

of rolling-mill stock (a, a'; b; b') at the collecting station (2) below
said first transfer means and above said lifting means (22); whereby
(b) said second suspended electromagnetic collecting means (10) acts
to collect and raise said first rolling-mill stock layer while said lifting

means (22) raises said already formed multi-layer of rolling-mill stock
in order to fix it below said first suspended rotatable electromagnetic

means (21), whereby thereafter said lifting means (22) lowers below
said transport system (4) in order not to interfere with the

advancement; whereby
(c) a subsequent rolling-mill stock layer (a'; b') is advanced while said
first transfer means (2) deposits said previously formed multi-layer of

rolling-mill stock (a, a'; b; b') in said packing pocket (30); and whereby
(d) said further advancement stopping means (52) acts to stop the
advancement of said subsequent rolling-mill stock layer (a';b') at said

superimposing station (1) below said second suspended electromagnetic
collecting means (10) and thereafter said first suspended rolling-mill

stock (a;b) already picked up is deposited on the top of said subsequent
rolling-mill stock layer (a';b') by lowering said second suspended

electromagnetic collecting means (10) while said transfer means (2)
returns above said lifting means (22).
