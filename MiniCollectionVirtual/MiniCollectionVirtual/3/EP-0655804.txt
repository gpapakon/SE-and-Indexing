<ABSTRACT>
A connector system is described wherein the most vulnerable parts of the front 
mating ends of a pair of connectors can be easily replaced in the field. The first 

connector (12, Fig. 2) includes a shell (20), a main insulator (22) within the shell, 
and main contacts (24) lying in the main insulator and having socket front ends 

(30). A first insert module (32) has an insert insulator (36) and insert contacts (38) 
with pin type rear ends. The first module is inserted into the shell of the first 

connector to mate with the main contacts. If the front ends (40) of the insert 
contacts are damaged, the connector can be repaired in the field by merely 

removing the first module and replacing it with another module. The second 
connector (14) is similarly constructed, with the modules (36, 36A) of the two 

connectors being identical so a single spare module can replace either one. The 
first module that lies in the first connector, has contact front ends forming sockets 

(40, Fig. 3) which are surrounded by a rigid insulator forming tapered passages 
(120) that guide pins into the sockets. The second module which lies in the 

second connector has contacts with pin-type front ends (62A), with the rears of the 
pins being surrounded by a layer (110) of elastomeric material that has a convex 

front end (114) to deform against the rigid front face (70) of the first module.

<DESCRIPTION>
Connectors that are used in a remote harsh environment where they may be 
subjected to shock and a corrosive and abrasive environment, may have their 
contact mating front ends damaged. Each connector typically has many contacts 
that are each securely fastened to the connector insulator, as where the rear ends 
of the contacts are connected to the wires of a cable that extends rearwardly of the 
connector. It would be desirable if the mating front ends of the contacts could be 
replaced in the field without disturbing the rear ends of the contacts. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a connector is 
provided with contact front ends protected by the connector shell, and with the 
contact front ends being field replaceable without disturbing the contact rear ends. 
The connector includes a main insulator lying within the shell and main contacts 
lying within the main insulator and having front ends lying far behind the front end 
of the shell. A first insert module lies in the shell, with the rear ends of the insert 
contacts mated with the front ends of the main contacts. The module insulator and 
module contacts preferably extend no further than the front end of the connector 
shell to protect them. The insert module is field replaceable, as where it is held by 
a snap ring accessible from the front end of the connector. A connector system can include a second connector which is mateable with the 
first one, and which is of corresponding construction. The second connector has 
a second shell which surrounds a second insulator and second contacts. A 
second module fits into the second shell and is field replaceable. The second 
module is substantially identical to the first module so they can replace one 
another.  A connector module whose contact front ends are sockets, has a rigid insulator 
with tapered passages for guiding pins into the sockets. The other connector front 
end has pins for reception in the sockets, and has an elastomeric layer with a 
convex front end lying at the rear ends of the pins for pressing against the rigid 
front end of the first connector. The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended 
claims. The invention will be best understood from the following description when 
read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1is an isometric view of a connector system of the present invention, with 
the first and second connectors shown fully mated. Fig. 2is a sectional side view of the connector system of Fig.
