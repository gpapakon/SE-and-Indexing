<ABSTRACT>
A transport caddie (1) that can be nested into transport caddies (1) of the same type is equipped with an arrangement for receiving goods, luggage or the like, and with a pushing arrangement (18) shaped as a handlebar (15) held by two handle holding parts (7) detachably secured to the transport caddie (1). A coin lock (19) equipped with a coupling arrangement allows the transport caddies (1) to be mutually coupled and uncoupled against a deposit or by using a coin substitute provided therefor, with or without any gathering points. The essential trait of the invention is that the coin lock (19) is slid on the handlebar (15) and secured against rotation by interlocking with one of both handle holding parts (7).
