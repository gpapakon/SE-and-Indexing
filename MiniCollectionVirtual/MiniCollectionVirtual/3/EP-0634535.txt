<ABSTRACT>
A planar roofing made of folded metal sheets which 
comprises a plurality of metal sheets (1) in which two non-adjacent 

edges are complementarily folded or otherwise 
shaped so as to allow the coupling of two adjacent metal 

sheets by partial overlap, and a plurality of supporting 
retainer blocks (25) which can be anchored to a purlin for 

the roofing. Each supporting retainer block comprises a base 
portion (26) for resting on the purlin and two lateral 

parallel raised portions (27,28) that rise from the base and 
are individually externally flanked by a respective recess 

(32,33) which is meant to accommodate a fold which is 
provided proximate to, and along, a folded edge (6,7) of a 

respective metal sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planar roofing made
of folded metal sheets. FR-A-2 222 512 discloses a planar
roofing including a combination of features as set forth in
the precharacterizing portion of the appended claim 1.Various sheet-metal roofing systems have already been
proposed which ensure a good roofing for buildings for both
civil and industrial use but have some drawbacks mainly
connected to difficulties in installation, as complicated
maneuvers or the use of special tools are often required.The aim of the present invention is to eliminate or
substantially reduce the above described drawbacks.An object of the present invention is to provide a new
planar roofing which is constituted by metal sheets having
two longitudinal parallel edges which are folded and can be
firmly anchored to the purlin of the roof to be covered,
without making through holes in the metal sheets, and can
withstand even considerable extraction loads due, for
example, to negative pressure or suction produced by wind.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
new planar roofing that allows even personnel lacking
specific training to easily and rapidly install the plates
that form it.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
walkable roofing that is highly durable and can withstand
extraction loads caused by the action of wind and can fully
drain both rainwater and water produced by the melting of
snow or ice.This and other objects which will become apparent
hereinafter are achieved by a planar roofing as defined in 
the independent claim.A few embodiments of the present invention are
hereinafter described with reference to the accompanying
drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a slightly elevated axonometric view of a
supporting retainer block;figure 2 is an axonometric view of the profile of a
metal sheet with lateral folds for forming a roofing with
joints provided with an internal drainage channel;figures 3 and 4 are schematic lateral elevation views
of a different step of the installation of two adjacent
metal sheets on a supporting retainer block of figure 1; figure 5 is an axonometric view of another embodiment
of the folded sheet with lateral edges meant to form lap
joints without an internal drainage channel;figure 6 is a perspective view of another embodiment of
a roofing sheet according to the invention;figure 7 is a perspective view of a supporting block 
for use with a roofing sheet of figure 6; andfigure 8 is a front elevation view of a joint between
two adjacent sheets on a supporting

<CLAIMS>
Planar roofing made of folded metal sheets, which
comprises a plurality of metal sheets (1;41) in which two

non-adjacent edges are complementarily folded or otherwise
shaped so as to allow the coupling of two adjacent sheets by

partial overlap, and a plurality of supporting retainer
blocks (25;58) which can be anchored to a purlin for the

roofing, each supporting retainer block comprising a base
portion (26;59) for resting on the purlin and two lateral

parallel raised portions (27;28) that rise from the base and
are individually internally flanked by a respective recess

(29;62;63) which is meant to accommodate a fold or bend
(7,8;48,49) which is provided proximate to, and along, a

folded edge of a respective metal sheet, each supporting
block further comprising an intermediate elevated portion

(30;60,61) rising from said base portion and above which said
two adjacent sheets are supported by said partial overlap,

the planar roofing being 
characterized in that
 said fold or
bend is formed of two consecutive folds in the form of a

double fold comprising a first folded portion (7;48)
followed by a second folded portion (8;49) so as to delimit

a relatively deep recess which is open upward and
fits, in a snap-together manner, in a respective recess of

one or more blocks, and said lateral raised portions extend
in a cantilevered manner above said base so that each raised

portion delimits a respective inclined recess which
accommodates, with a snap-together mating, said double

fold comprising the first and second folded portions, and
said intermediate elevated portion (30;60,61) being 

integrally formed with said base portion (26;59) of each
supporting block.
Roofing according to claim 1, characterized in that
each recess or groove (29;62;63) is inclined towards the

respective raised portion by a preset angle.
Roofing according to claim 2, characterized in that
each recess (62;63) or groove is flared.
Roofing according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that each recess or groove has an

outer side with a filleted rim (64) and an inner side which
ends with an abutment wall (65) which is inclined with

respect to the inner side and is in turn followed by a wall
portion (66) that is a part of the outer side of respective

intermediate raised portions (60,61) forming said
intermediate elevated portion and ends with an upper

abutment undercut (67).
Roofing according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that one or more holes (34;68) for

an anchoring means are provided between said raised
portions.
Roofing according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that each plate, at each

folded edge, has a raised portion (4;46) which delimits a
flat strip and is connected, by means of said first folded

and filleted portion, to said second folded portion.
Roofing according to claim 6, characterized in that
said second folded portion ends at an inclined abutment

portion (51) which is meant to engage an upper abutment
undercut (67) of a plurality of blocks.
Roofing according to any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said intermediate

elevated portion (30) has a lateral recess (32,33) that is
directed towards each one of said grooves (29), runs

parallel to them and delimits, in an upper region, a cradle
(31) which is meant to act as support for a drainage channel

(20) delimited between two adjacent plates.
Roofing according to claim 8, characterized in that
said raised portion (30) has at least one hole (34) for

accommodating means for fixing to the purlin.
Roofing according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said double fold is

followed by an upright portion (9,10) which on one side of
the plate continues with a cantilevered portion (11) and on

the other side of the plate ends with a configuration
(16,17,18,19;21) for engagement with the cantilevered

portion of an adjacent plate.
Roofing according to claim 10, characterized in
that said cantilevered portion is provided with two lateral

longitudinal reinforcement ridges (15), whereas on the other
side its upright portion ends with a ridge (21) that can

engage a corresponding longitudinal ridge of the
cantilevered portion of an adjacent plate.
Roofing according to claim 10, characterized in
that the cantilevered portion ends with a descending wall

(12) that has an end wing (13), whereas on the other side,
at a level that is equal to said end wing, the respective

upright portion bends substantially in a cantilevered manner
to delimit an engagement groove (16) for the end wing of an

adjacent plate, followed by a fold (17,18) shaped like a
relatively deep drainage channel. 
Roofing according to claim 12, characterized in
that said fold shaped like a drainage channel comprises two

lateral walls (17,19) and an inclined bottom wall (18) which

shaped drainage channel (20) which is overlapped by a shaped
edge (10,11,12) of the opposite overlapping one of said
