<ABSTRACT>
A key control system comprises the generation of a 
first set of keys (44) which are then used for a 

plurality of respective postage meters (12). The keys 
are then related to a respective meter in accordance 

with a map or algorithm. The keys may be changed by 
entering the second key via an encryption (DES) using 

the first key.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to key management for
controlling keys used in encoding information and to key
changing, and is applicable to mail processing systems
and more particularly to security of postage metering
systems.US-A-4 935 961 describes a method and apparatus for
generating cryptographic keys for a postal manifest and
for synchronizing cryptographic keys for transmitting
postal data securely on a communications link. The
techniques for generating a key and for synchronizing
keys use the same apparatus but use slightly different
data to create a cryptographic key.The postal data center maintains a unique set of
data for each server station, i.e. the ID of each server and the corresponding unique master
key KO. Using this set of data
along with a manifest sequence number (or communication
transaction number) and the date, a cryptographic key is
created. Each server station stores a fixed, unique master key,
KO, a permutation table, Pt, and ID, and GMT date. Using
the manifest sequence number (or the communication
transaction number) a row of the permutation table is
altered and the master key KO is scrambled with the
permutation table to get a new key K2. With K2, the
date, server ID, and manifest sequence number (or
communication transaction number) are encrypted. The
result of this encryption yields another key K3. K3 is
then used for encrypting the postal manifest or for
communicating with a postal data center.EP-A-0 320 489 describes a method for increasing the
security of an IC card which communicates with a
computer. The IC card contains a pseudo-random number
generator which generates a number that is transmitted to
the computer, where it is encrypted using a predetermined 
code. The result is sent back to the IC card where the
same encryption process using the same code is carried
out and the result is compared with that received from
the computer. If there is a match, the authenticity of
the card is validated. Following each generation of a
pseudo-random number the starting value for the
generation of the pseudo-random number is changed. This
change of the starting value is carried out either by
increasing the starting value by a fixed amount or by
replacing the old start value with the result of the
preceding pseudo-random number generation process, or by
a combination of the two.Recent advances in digital printing technology have
made it possible to implement digital, e.g. bit map
addressable, printing for the purpose of evidencing
payment of postage by a postage-meter-like device. Where

<CLAIMS>
A method for key management for controlling the keys
used in encoding information to be printed on a mailpiece

for validating the mailpiece comprising the steps of:

generating a predetermined number of keys;
assigning one of said keys to a particular postage
meter by means of a determined relationship (F)

associated with the postage meter, said relationship
being derived as a predetermined function corresponding

to the particular postage meter; and
installing the assigned key in the particular
postage meter.
A method for key management according to claim 1,
wherein the determined relationship is a pointer.
The method of claim 1 or 2 further comprising the
steps of:


generating (600) a predetermined number of new keys;
assigning one of said new keys to the particular
postage meter by means of newly determined relationship

(F

);
providing (610) an encryption of the assigned new
key to the postage meter using the previously assigned

key; and
decrypting (620) the encryption of the new key in said
postage meter for installing (630) the new key in the

postage meter.
A system for key management for controlling the keys
used in encoding information to be printed on a mailpiece

for validating the mailpiece, comprising:

means for generating a predetermined number of keys;
means for assigning one of said keys to a particular
postage meter by means of a determined relationship or

pointer associated with the postage meter, said
relationship or pointer being derived as a predetermined

function corresponding to the particular postage meter;
and
means for installing the assigned key in the
particular postage meter.
