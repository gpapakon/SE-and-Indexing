<ABSTRACT>
In order to facilitate the formation of a plastic 
member with an aperture in a central portion thereof, a 

ring gating valve arrangement is provided with a 
multi-piston servo arrangement which enables a specially 

configured pin (134) to be stepwisely reciprocated back and forth 
within a molding device. The pin (134) is formed with a land (134a) at 

one end which is dimensioned and shaped to produce the 
required aperture. The pin (134) further features a channel 

structure which includes an annular recess (134d) adapted to 
permit plastic to flow into the center of the mold cavity 

area (120) when the pin (134) is thrust to a predetermined location. 
After the cavity is filled with hot plastic, the pin (134) is 

retracted to a position wherein the annular recess (134d) is 
located within a removable gate bushing (116) and the shaped land (134a) 

is pulled up until it is appropriately located in the mold 
cavity area (120). As the injected plastic cools and solidifies, 

the shaped land (134a) acts as the aperture molding pin and forms 
a clean aperture in the molded part. After solidification, 

the pin (134) is retracted and the mold is opened to permit the 
molded part to be ejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to molding devices according to
the prior art of claim 1. Such a device is known from
document EP-A-0 480 223.Known mold gate systems are common in design and
mode of operation. That is to say, hot plastic material
is usually distributed through a hot manifold to a heated
nozzle assembly. A valve gate pin within the heated
nozzle is either hydraulically, pneumatically or
mechanically retracted from a gate orifice in the mold
cavity and hot plastic is injected therethrough into the
mold cavity. After the cavity is filled, the valve gate
pin is returned to its closed position wherein it seats
against the gate orifice to cut-off the flow of plastic.However, when the mold is opened and the plastic
part is ejected, inevitably a "gate pin mark" impression
can be seen on the surface of the part at the location
where the plastic was injected.The desired position for the injection mold gating
of circular or square parts is usually in the center of
the part. When a through hole is required to be formed
at the center of the part, the gating must be offset from
the center and use made of hot tip, cold runner, or gate
valve techniques. However, these techniques tend to
result in uneven filling, create molded-in part stress
and a produce a weld line which originates at the core 
pin which forms the hole. Viz., as shown in Figs. 1 and
2 the hot plastic flow (f) which is injected via a heated
probe or conventional valve gate 1, enters a mold cavity
2 at a location or gate point (p) and separates (as
indicated by the bold arrows) into two flows which pass
around on either side of the projection or pin 3 which is
used to form the required opening. When the two flow
fronts meet on the other side of the pin, the undesirable
weld line (w) is created.Alternatively, instead of using the above mentioned
offset injection technique, the part may be centrally
gated in the area of the hole which is formed, using hot
or cold multi-tipped edge gating in the manner
illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. However, this technique
results in a less than perfect surface at each gate point
and also produces flow lines in the molded part
originating between the individual gate locations. Viz.,
as illustrated in Fig. 4, a number of flow or weld lines
are created by the multiple flows of plastic which result
from injection by way of a sprue 4 having multiple
sub-gates. Viz., as shown, in the case wherein the sprue
has three sub-gates, three separate flows are produced
within the mold cavity. Upon the flow fronts meeting one
