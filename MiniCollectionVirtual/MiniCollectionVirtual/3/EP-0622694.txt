<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mailboxing system and sorter for feeding sheets from an 
output device, such as a printer, into selected mailbox bins. More particularly the system provides a 
means for locking and unlocking one or more of the selected mailbox bins. When a copying machine is accessed from a remotely located workstation, there may be a 
time lag between the time when the copies are reproduced and the time when the operator collects 
the collated sets of copies. Furthermore, when several individuals are utilizing a centralized 
reproducing machine, frequently more than one individual is waiting to make copies at the printing 
machine. Under either of the foregoing circumstances, it is difficult to prevent individuals, not having 
a need to know, from seeing confidential documents. Thus, it is highly desirable to advance the copy 
sheets to bins which are lockable. Under these circumstances only the individual having a need to 
know the information contained on the document would have access to the lockable bins. This 
precludes others from inadvertently or deliberately obtaining the information on the confidential 
document. Various techniques have been devised to achieve the foregoing, such as those described 
in the following disclosures. US Defensive Publication T 102 102 discloses bins positioned at a copier output which are 
locked to the user by means of a badge reader or the like. The user enters identification data into the 
copier to enable the copier to operate. US-A 4, 437,660 describes a scanning mechanism for scanning individual output bins for 
receiving documents from a paper printer. The mechanism determines each bin's availability for 
receiving documents, the degree of fullness and whether or not a lock box is positioned in the bin for 
receiving designated documents. US-A- 4,470,356 describes a lockbox for a word processor printer output bin attached to a 
printer. the lockbox, which is insertable and removable from the output bin, is locked in the bin upon 
insertion, and can only be removed by disengagement of a first locking means. The lockbox has a 
security door which is positioned in a paper receiving position upon insertion into the output bin and 
which must be closed in order to remove the lockbox from the output bin. EP-A-241 273 describes a sheet handling apparatus with means for locking a selected bin to 
receive the sheets therein so as to prevent access to the sheets received in the selected bin by 
unauthorized individuals. JP-A-63138883 describes a

<CLAIMS>
A mailboxing system for feeding sheets from an output device into a mailbox bin (11) 
selected from a plurality of mailbox bins (11) disposed in a housing with at least some slidably 

supported therein, the system including control means (100) for controlling sheet feeding means to 
feed the sheets from the output device into the selected mailbox bin, the sheet feeding means 

including a plurality of diverter gates (32), each diverter gate (32) being associated with a respective 
mailbox bin (11), each diverter gate (32) being individually movable from a first position, permitting 

sheets to travel past its associated bin, to a second position for directing the sheets into its 
associated bin, and including actuator means (35) for selectively moving one of the diverter gates 

(32) to the second position, locking means (50,54) operable by said control means (100) for 
restricting access to sheets stacked in the selected mailbox bin and release means operable to 

release the locking means for providing access to the stacked sheets in the selected bin, the locking 
means serving to lock the mailbox bins in the housing to prevent sliding movement of a mailbox bin 

whilst sheets are still being fed into that mailbox bin and the release means serving to unlock the 
mailbox bins to permit sliding movement and to allow at least partial removal of a mailbox bin from 

the housing only when sheets are not being fed into that mailbox bin. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the release means is operable 
to release the locking means (50,54) for the selected mailbox bin (11) while one or more or all of the 

remainder of the mailbox bins remain locked. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein at least some of the 
mailbox bins are spring-loaded so as to automatically slide out like drawers from the housing when 

released by a latching mechanism. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the latching mechanism is 
operably released by electromagnetic means. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the sheet 
feeding means includes sheet treatment means in the input sheet path upstream of the bins for 

allowing a choice of side-ways or end-wise sheet bin stacking, and/or selection of the side of a set of 
sheets to be stapled. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the sheet 
feeding means includes sheet inverter means for inverting sheets prior to entering the mailbox.  

 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the mailbox 
bins are electronically unlockable by user access codes. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the control 
means (100) variably controls the bin selection to continue to direct sheets for a job or jobs having a 

same user code into the same first bin if the job or jobs will not overfill that bin, and into an overfill bin 
if the job or jobs will overfill the first bin. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein notification 
means is provided for alerting a user to unload the sheets of a job or jobs from a bin. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein a user 
interface is provided whereby a user can gain access to the sheets in their selected bin by entering 

his user code into the user interface. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the user interface includes a 
keypad into which the user enters his user code. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein notification 
means is provided for providing a removal instruction when a job has been left in a mailbox bin 

beyond a preset period. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein a user bin 
indicator means is provided, the indicator means being repeatedly updated by the control means for 

identifying to the users which of the mailbox bins contain job sets for a particular user. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in claim 13, wherein the user bin indicator means 
comprises display means activated by entry of an access code into a user code entry device for the 

control means. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14, wherein the output 
device is a printer. 
A mailboxing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 15, wherein said control 
means (100) selects which ones of said bins will be assigned to a particular user in response to 

repeated determinations of which mailboxes are currently available for stacking job sets therein, a bin 
being currently available for another user only if it is empty or has been emptied out in the meantime  

 
by a prior user, but is currently available for the same user previously assigned that bin even if not 

empty as long as that bin is not going to overfill on the next job set being printed.
