<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the production of glass-ceramic 
articles, with particular reference to substrates 

for rigid information disks to be used in magnetic memory 
storage devices. The glass-ceramic articles are highly 

crystalline, very fine-grained, and are prepared by heat 
treating precursor glass articles consisting essentially, 

expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis, of

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to canasite-type fine grained 
glass-ceramics for rigid magnetic storage disks and a 
method of making same. United States Patent 4,386,162 discloses the 
preparation of glass-ceramic articles wherein canasite 
and/or agrellite and/or fedorite crystals comprise the 
predominant crystal phase(s). The patent notes that the crystals typically exhibit 
widths of about 0.25-2 µm and lengths of about 1-25 µm. 
The working examples show the sometime additional presence 
of fluorite (CaF₂) crystals. United States Patent 4,971,932 describes the 
fabrication of magnetic memory storage devices and 
particularly rigid information disks for use therein, the 
disks consisting essentially of a glass-ceramic substrate 
having a coating of magnetic media on the surface thereof, 
especially of glass-ceramics wherein the predominant 
crystal phase has a sheet silicate, more preferably a chain 
silicate microstructure, and most preferably canasite 
crystals. Substrates of some of these compositions were 
especially desirable by having 
(1) high body strength and fracture toughness is 
evidenced by modulus of rupture values in the vicinity of 
40,000 psi (∼280 MPa) and KIC values in the vicinity of 5 
MPa √m; (2) an elastic modulus similar to aluminum;  (3) a hard surface hardness as indicated by a Knoop 
hardness greater than 500, as opposed to less than 100 for 
aluminum; (4) excellent chemical durability in moist 
environments; and (5) flat and smooth surfaces of high precision. Nevertheless, as the technology of the fabrication of 
magnetic memory storage devices has progressed, the 
criticality of the substrate surface to be defect-free and 
non-porous has assumed ever increasing significance. 
Hence, the fabricators of such devices have demanded that 
the substrates have very smooth, polished surfaces which 
enable the use of ultra-low flying heights for read/write 
heads which, in turn, permits more data to be encoded on a 
disk. Microscopic examination of the disks has found the 
sometime presence of submicron-sized pits in the surfaces 
thereof. The formation of such pits has been traced to 
differential polishing and pluckout of crystals in the 
surface. Therefore, the principal objective of the present 
invention is to eliminate the formation of those pits, 
thereby allowing smaller bit sizes with consequent higher 
bit densities. A second objective is to produce a smoother polished 
surface by providing a finer microstructure in the glass-ceramic. The typical heat treatment for transforming
