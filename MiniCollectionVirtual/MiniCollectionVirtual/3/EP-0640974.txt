<ABSTRACT>
A reference voltage generation circuit includes: a 
load unit (24) having one end (24A) thereof connected to 

a higher voltage power supply line (23); an enhancement 
type n-channel MIS transistor (25) having a drain (27) 

thereof connected to the other end (24B) of the load 
unit, and a source thereof connected to a lower voltage 

power supply line; and a source follower circuit (26) 
using a MIS transistor as a driving element, the source 

follower circuit having an input end (26A) thereof 
connected to the drain of the n-channel MIS transistor 

and having an output end (26B) thereof connected to a 
gate of the n-channel MIS transistor. A reference 

voltage (Vref) is obtained at the drain of the n-channel 
MIS transistor. By this constitution, it is 

possible to obtain a stable reference voltage, and to 
incorporate the reference voltage generation circuit 

into an integrated circuit produced by integrating MIS 
transistors, without introducing an increase in the number 

of production processes. It is also possible to reduce a 
consumed current of the reference voltage generation 

circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reference
voltage generation circuit, more particularly, to a
reference voltage generation circuit intended for use
in an integrated circuit formed by
integrating metal insulation semiconductor (MIS)
transistors, specifically metal oxide semiconductor
(MOS) transistors, such as insulated-gate field-effect
transistors.For example, a dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) includes a voltage reduction circuit which
reduces a reference voltage such as 5 [V] supplied from
outside to 3 [V], and uses the reduced voltage as an
internal power supply voltage. A reference voltage
generation circuit is necessary for constituting such a
voltage reduction circuit.Also, a reference voltage generation circuit
is necessary when an analog integrated circuit, such as
a D/A converter for converting a digital signal to an
analog signal, or an A/D converter for converting an
analog signal to a digital signal, is constituted.Generally, it is preferable that a reference
voltage is a constant voltage which does not depend on
the temperature. In a MOS integrated circuit, however,
an operation speed is proportional to a power supply
voltage and is inversely proportional to the temperature.
Accordingly, it is preferable that a reference voltage
has positive temperature characteristics especially
when the reference voltage is used in a voltage
reduction circuit for generating an internal power
supply voltage. On the other hand, in an integrated circuit,
an increase in production processes thereof leads to an
increase in cost thereof, and thus a reference voltage
generation circuit to be built in the integrated circuit
ideally has a constitution which does not require additional
production processes.However, a known reference voltage generation
circuit needs to be produced using a so-called "triple-well
process", while a typical MOS integrated circuit
can be produced using a so-called "twin-well process".
Namely, when such a reference voltage generation circuit
is incorporated into a typical MOS integrated circuit,
a problem occurs in that the entire production process
is increased due to the difference of the number of
wells, i.e., the difference of the number of processes,
and thus the cost of production is increased significantly.Also, another reference voltage generation
circuit is known in which it is difficult to restrict a
consumed current therein to a predetermined amount or
less. In this case, it would be possible to reduce the
consumed current by setting a resistance value of a
circuit
