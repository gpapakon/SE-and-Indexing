<ABSTRACT>
1. In the case of liquid gas quick connections (couplings) for connecting the side valves of a tanker (tank wagon) to the liquid- and gas-phase charging arms for the charging and discharging of liquefied gases, with connecting flange with pipe piece and male part, union nut and sealing ring, according to the prior art, the object is to further improve the security of the closure system and to achieve reductions in the charging times. The innovation consists in a union nut/wrench combination with the following features:   a) the union nut has an outer ring with holes passing in the axial direction through the same at specified distances from one another, b) an arcuate wrench part, corresponding in its dimensions approximately to a reference circle of the outer ring, has two pins whose dimensions and distances from one another on the wrench part are dimensioned so that on attachment of the wrench the pins positively engage in the holes of the union nut which are made in the outer ring, c) the wrench part merges at one end into a lever arm for actuation of the wrench in the form of a hand lever for loosening and tightening the union nut.
