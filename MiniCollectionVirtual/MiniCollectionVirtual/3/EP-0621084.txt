<ABSTRACT>
The movable actuating lever (3) is on the one hand connected to a transmission lever (7) and on the other hand guided by means of a pin (5) in a guide (6) of the device housing (1). The transmission lever (7) serves at the same time for transmitting the actuating movement via further levers (11, 13) to the device part to be actuated. As a result of the position and shape of the guide groove (6) and of the lever (7), the course of movement of the actuating lever (3) with regard to the fixed handle part (2) can be adapted in an optimum manner to technical and ergonomic requirements in order to guarantee an efficient force transmission affected with minimal friction losses. Moreover, there are no inconvenient levers in the handle region, as a result of which injuries are avoided.

Device at an apparatus for the manual actuating of a
moved apparatus part, more particularly of a thrust member

for dispensing a flowable medium, comprising an actuating
lever (3) having four contact points (30 - 33) for the four

fingers of a hand, the actuating lever (3) being connected
to the part of the apparatus by a lever system (7, 7a; 11,

13), characterised in that the actuating lever (3) is
swivellably connected to a transmission lever (7, 7a) as

well as guided in a guiding means (6, 6a).
Device in an apparatus for the manual actuating of a
moved apparatus part, more particularly of a thrust member

for dispensing a flowable medium, comprising an actuating
lever (3) having four contact points (30 - 33) for the four

fingers of a hand, the actuating lever (3) being connected
to the moved apparatus part by a lever system (17, 17a; 20,

20a; 11, 13) and being suspended and guided by means of two
swivellable levers (17, 17a; 20, 20a) of the lever system,

characterised in that one of the two swivellable levers is
a transmission lever (17, 17a) which is connected to the

moved apparatus part and the other swivellable lever is a
guiding lever (20, 20a) which is connected to the housing,

and in that at least one of these levers (20, 17a) acts on
half of the actuating lever (3) facing the apparatus (1).
Manual actuating device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the lower swivelling axis (8; 19) of

the transmission lever (7; 17) is located about at the
middle of the gripping points (31, 32) of the four fingers

in order to lower the torque acting upon the guiding means 
(6) resp. the ensile or pressure forces acting upon the

bearings (16, 18).
Manual actuating device according to claim 1, characterised
in that the the guiding means (6, 6a) have a curved

or a rectilinear form according to the control of the
desired progression of the movement of the actuating lever

(3).
Manual actuating device according to claim 4,
characterised in that with respect to the actuating

direction of the actuating lever, the guiding means (6, 6a)
is arranged in front of or behind the point where the

transmission lever (7, 7a) is acting on the actuating lever
(3).
Manual actuating device according to claim 5, characterised
in that the actuating lever (3) is guided in the

guiding means (6), which is disposed in front of the
connecting point, by an eye (4) which is provided at its

end opposite the handle (2) and facing the apparatus, by
means of a guiding pin (5), a guide roller, or a ball

bearing, and in that the transmission lever (7) is hinged
on the other end of the actuating lever (3) facing the

apparatus.
Manual actuating device according to one of claims 1,
3, and 4, characterised in that the actuating lever (3) is

guided in the guiding means (6a) which is disposed behind
the connecting point, by an eye (4a) which is provided at

its end facing the apparatus and at the handle (2) by means
of a guiding pin (5), a guide roller, or a ball bearing.
Manual actuating device according to claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that the guiding lever (20, 20a), seen 

from the fixed handle portion (2), is either disposed in
front of or behind the transmission lever (17, 17a).
Manual actuating device according to one of claims 2,
3, or 8, characterised in that the levers (17, 17a; 20,

20a) are enclosed within the hollow actuating lever (3).
