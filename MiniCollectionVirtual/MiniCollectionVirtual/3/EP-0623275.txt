<ABSTRACT>
The mower attachment has a lifting frame (3) attached to the tractor and a main frame (6) from which a front frame (7) has vertical pivots in the centre and at the two sides. The pivots carry tilt levers which swing in a horizontal plane and which support left- and right booms (11) from which the cutting discs are supported. In the extended position the tilt levers move the booms outwards for a maximum swathe while in the transport setting the booms are pulled inwards to locate behind each other. The PTO drive is split to the two booms. The two settings of the booms are controlled by double acting hydraulic cylinders and the two settings are locked by safety bolts.
