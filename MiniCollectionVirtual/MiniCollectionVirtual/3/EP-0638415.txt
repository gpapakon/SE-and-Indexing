<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multilayered
polypropylene cast films having improved creasability
characteristics, and in particular it relates to multilayered
polypropylene cast films where at least one layer has higher
stiffness and/or lower elongation at break than the other
layer.Due to their mechanical and physical properties, the
multilayered films according to the present invention are
particularly suitable to be used in the packaging field,
especially in confectionery packaging.Multilayered films that can be used in a variety of
fields, especially in food packaging, are already known in the
art. Films which are prepared using solely propylene
homopolymer present some drawbacks, such as brittleness,
failure to maintain creases and low impact resistance.In order to overcome some of said drawbacks of
polypropylene films, the polypropylene used either has some
particular properties (as in published European patent
application EP-A-432452), or it is coextruded with hydrogenated
resins (as in published European patent application EP-A
544632).European patent application EP-A 432452 describes
monooriented films, mono- and multilayered, of polypropylene
and propylene copolymers, which offer both transparency and
capacity of keeping a crease. Said patent application teaches 
that the latter characteristic is obtained by using a propylene
homo- or copolymer having a narrow molecular weight
distribution.EP-A-483 675 discloses mono- and multilayered films prepared by
a polymer composition comprising a copolymer or propylene with
a minor amount of a C4-C8 alpha-olefin and a copolymer of propylene
with 5-10 wt% ethylene. Said films show a good transparency,
weldability and moisture barrier properties. Now new films have been found which have good creasability
properties and, therefore, are capable of holding a crease
well. Said property makes the films of the present invention
particularly suitable for use in the packaging field,
particularly for the uses mentioned above.Unlike the propylene homo- and co-polymers mentioned in
the above EP-A-432452 patent application, now it has been found
that also the homo- and co-polymers which constitute a layer
of the film of the present invention, in view of the fact that
they have a wide molecular weight distribution, also have
physico-mechanical characteristics which enable them to
maintain a crease.An added advantage of the films of the present invention
is that they present good transparency. One more advantage
displayed by the films of the present invention is
