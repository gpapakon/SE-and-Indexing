<ABSTRACT>
The pull-open strip with security marking, consisting of a thermoplastic, oriented carrier foil covered on one side with a sealing layer and on the other side possibly with a release layer, is characterized by the fact that the carrier foil is provide with micro printing on one side. A Independent claim is also included for a method which involves steps of micro printing and subsequent application of a sealing layer for producing such a strip, and its application for production of a packaging foil.
