<ABSTRACT>
A slitting device including first (31) and second (37) cutting
rollers disposed parallel to each other, a first guide

roller (33) axially adjacent to the first cutting roller (31), and
a second guide roller (35) axially adjacent to the second

cutting roller (37). The cutting rollers (31,37) have axially
adjacent cutting edges (31b,37b) at which a sheet material is cut

into two strips, and recessed portions (31a,37a) on the outer
circumferential surfaces. The guide rollers (33,35) have cutout

portions (33b,33c,35b,35c) circumferentially extending and axially opposed
to each other on the outer circumferential surfaces, and

projections (33a,35a) defined by the cutout portions (33b,33c,35b,35c) and opposed to
the recessed portions (31a,37a) of the cutting rollers (31,37). The

cutting rollers cooperate with the corresponding guide
rollers to define therebetween spaces for the strips of

the sheet material. The cutting rollers and the guide
rollers have a same outer diameter.


The invention also relates to an apparatus for forming corrugated-fin
strips from a sheet material and to a method for cutting a sheet material into strips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a slitting
device for cutting a sheet material into strips, and a
method therefor.Japanese Patent Application First Publication No.
6-55224 discloses an apparatus for forming corrugated-fin
strips for use in a heat exchanger such as a radiator.
Fig. 7 shows the apparatus including a tension device 2
for applying tension to a fin material 1, a slitting
device 3 for cutting the fin material 1 into two parallel
strips, a corrugating device 5 for forming corrugations
(fins) in the strips, and a feed device 7 for feeding the
strips with the corrugations. Reference numeral 100
denotes a direction of process flow. The fin material 1
fed to the slitting device 3 is cut into the two strips
by upper and lower cutting rollers 4, 4. A pair of
corrugation cutters 6, 6 of the corrugating device 5
cooperate to form corrugations in the strips of the fin
material 1. The strips with corrugations are fed to the
feed device 7 in which a pair of feed rollers 8, 8
compress the strips with corrugations for adjusting a fin
pitch. Thus, two corrugated-fin strips 9 having the
adjusted fin pitch are formed. The two corrugated-fin
strips 9 are then fed to a cutting device (not shown) and
cut into a predetermined length.However, in the related art described above, the
fin material 1 straightly extends to the corrugating
device 5 through a gap between the cutting rollers 4, 4
of the slitting device 3, so that the fin material 1
tends to slip relative to the cutting rollers 4, 4. This 
will cause difficulties in cutting the fin material 1
into the strips.Document AT-B-373 805, which is considered to represent the closest prior art for the
subject-matter of claim 1, discloses
a slitting device for cutting a sheet material into strips, comprising:
a first cutting roller rotatable about a first axis, the first cutting roller including a first
cutting edge;a second cutting roller rotatable about a second axis parallel to the first axis, the

edge and cooperating therewith for cutting the sheet material into the strips;a first guide roller disposed coaxially with the first cutting roller and adjacent thereto
