<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatic commissioning machine (1) for automatically commissioning items (3) located on shelves (2). Selected items (3) are conveyed to a driven conveyor belt (5) by means of a displacement unit (4) and then transported further on said conveyor belt to an output point (A). According to the invention, the shelf unit (2) has shelf bases (6) arranged diagonally one above the other and is configured in such a way that the vertical projection of the shelf bases runs in the direction of the longitudinal extension of the conveyor belt (5). Individual shelf bases (6) with lower item support, preferably every shelf base, has a parallel item slide (7) which is arranged at the same angle and is located over the conveyor belt (5). The bottom end of the item slide (7) is situated in the contact-free area of the conveyor belt (5).
