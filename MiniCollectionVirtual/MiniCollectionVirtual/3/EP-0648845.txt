<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acids can be amplified and detected 
using a very rapid polymerase chain reaction procedure 

in which two different nucleic acid sequences are 
present. This method allows one to preferentially 

modulate (for example, suppress) the degree of 
amplification of one or more nucleic acid sequences 

relative to other nucleic acid sequences. This 
modulation is achieved by exploiting differences in the 

relative primer melt temperatures, or by using certain 
ratios of primers. Each PCR cycle is very fast, that 

is less than 90 seconds. This method is particularly 
useful for amplification and detection of DNA 

associated with infectious agents that may be present 
in a specimen in very small quantities compared to 

other nontargeted nucleic acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to very rapid
preferential amplification of two or more nucleic acid
sequences, whereby a target nucleic acid sequence is
readily amplified and detected while amplification of
nontarget nucleic acid sequences is suppressed. The
amplification technique used is polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).Nucleic acid probe technology has developed
rapidly in recent years as researchers have discovered
its value for detection of various diseases, organisms
or genetic features which are present in small
quantities in a human or animal test sample. The use
of probes is based upon the concept of complementarity.
DNA has two strands bound together by hydrogen bonds
between complementary nucleotides (which are also known
as nucleotide pairs).The DNA complex is normally stable, but the
strands can be separated (or denatured) by conditions
which disrupt the hydrogen bonding. The released
single strands will reassociate only with another
strand having a complementary sequence of nucleotides.
This hybridization process can occur with both strands
being in solution or with one of the strands being
attached to a solid substrate.A targeted nucleic acid sequence in an
organism or cell may be only a very small portion of
the entire DNA molecule so that it is very difficult to
detect its presence using most labeled DNA probes.
Much research has been carried out to find ways to
detect only a few molecules of a targeted nucleic acid. PCR is a significant advance in the art to allow detection of very small concentrations of a
targeted nucleic acid. The details of PCR are described, for example, in US-A-4,683,195,
US-A-4,683,202 and US-A-4,965,188 and by Mullis et al, Methods of Enzymology155,
pp. 335-350, 1987.EP-A-0 511 712 (Eastman Kodak Company) discloses a method of nucleic acid
amplification and detection using a fast PCR procedure that includes a series of steps
which have critically-defined temperature and time parameters. Each PCR cycle requires
less than 2 minutes in this method.Sugimoto et al (1993) Analytical Biochemistry 211: 170-172, describes a method of
quantitative detection of DNA by co-amplification PCR and teaches that the
thermodynamic stability of the duplex of primer and template is related to the efficiency of
co-amplification.Despite the broad and rapid use of PCR in a variety of biological and diagnostic fields,
there are still limitations which must be overcome to achieve the optimum success of the
technology.Human or animal DNA specimens contain many different nucleic acids, some of
