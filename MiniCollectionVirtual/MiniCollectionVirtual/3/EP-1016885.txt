<ABSTRACT>
A gender selectable fiber optic connector is provided which can be readily
converted between male and female configurations following assembly and polishing

of the connector. The gender selectable fiber optic connector includes a housing (12),
a ferrule (14) operably connected to the housing (12) such that a forward portion of

the ferrule (14) extends beyond the housing (12), and a shroud (18) adapted to be
moved upon the forward portion of the ferrule (14) such that the forward portion of

the ferrule extends through a passageway (22) defined by the shroud. In order to
alter the gender of the fiber optic connector, the shroud (18) has both male and

female configurations. In this regard, the male configuration of the shroud includes
at least one guide pin (24) extending lengthwise through the passageway (22) defined

by the shroud for engaging a lengthwise extending alignment groove (14b) defined
by the ferrule (14) in order to produce a male fiber optic connector. In contrast, the

female configuration of the shroud is free of guide pins such that mounting the female
configuration of the shroud upon the ferrule produces a female fiber optic connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fiber optic connectors and associated
fabrication methods and, more particularly, to multi-fiber connectors having male and
female configurations and associated fabrication methods.Multi-fiber cables or ribbons are being increasingly employed in a wide variety of
applications. As such, several standard multi-fiber connectors have been developed and
are commonly employed. Perhaps one of the most common multi-fiber connectors is the
MT RJ connector having a rectangularly-shaped MT ferrule developed by Nippon
Telegraph & Telephone Corporation of Tokyo, Japan. However, another common multifiber
connector is the SC DC connector having a substantially cylindrical DC ferrule
developed by Siecor Corporation of Hickory, North Carolina.Since the SC DC connector does not include guide pins that would extend beyond
the end surface of the DC ferrule, the SC DC connector can be advantageously
assembled prior to polishing the end surface of the DC ferrule. In this regard, the post-assembly
polishing of an SC DC connector is facilitated by the accessibility of the
cylindrical exterior surface of the DC ferrule which is formed to within extremely tight
tolerances and which serves as a polishing datum or point of reference during polishing
operations.In contrast to the SC DC connector, which has a single configuration, the MT RJ
connector has two configurations, namely, a male configuration, which includes a pair of
guide pins extending outwardly beyond the forward end of the MT ferrule, and a female 
configuration, which does not include guide pins but defines a pair of guide pin holes.
As known to those skilled in the art, the two configurations are necessary since in order
to mate a pair of MT RJ connectors, the guide pins of a male MT RJ connector are
inserted into the guide pin holes of a female MT RJ connector. In order to retain the
guide pins in the male configuration of the MT RJ connector, each MT RJ connector
generally includes a pin keeper. The pin keeper is typically positioned immediately
rearward of the MT ferrule within the connector housing such that the guide pins extend
through the guide pin holes denned by the MT ferrule and outwardly beyond the forward
end of the MT ferrule. Thus, the guide pins of the male configuration of an MT RJ
connector must be inserted during the factory assembly process and cannot be inserted in
the field once the remainder of the MT RJ connector has been assembled. As a result,
the female configuration of an MT RJ connector cannot

A gender selectable fiber optic connector comprising:

a housing;
a ferrule operably connected to said housing, said ferrule including a forward
portion that extends beyond said housing and that defines at least one lengthwise

extending alignment groove; and
a shroud defining a passageway therethrough, said shroud being adapted to be
mounted upon the forward portion of said ferrule such that the forward portion of

said ferrule extends through the passageway, said shroud being selected from the
group consisting of shrouds having a male configuration and shrouds having a female

configuration, wherein the male configuration of said shroud includes at least one
guide pin extending lengthwise through the passageway for engaging the respective

alignment groove defined by said ferrule to produce a male fiber optic connector, and
wherein the female configuration of said shroud is free of guide pins so as to produce

a female fiber optic connector.
A gender selectable fiber optic connector according to Claim 1 wherein said
shroud comprises a shroud body defining the passageway therethrough, and wherein

the at least one guide pin of the male configuration of said shroud is partially
embedded within the shroud body and extends beyond at least one end of the shroud

body.
A gender selectable fiber optic connector according to Claim 1 wherein said
ferrule defines at least two lengthwise extending alignment grooves, and wherein the

male configuration of said shroud includes at least two guide pins extending
lengthwise through the passageway for engaging respective alignment grooves.
A gender selectable fiber optic connector according to Claim 1 wherein the
male configuration of said shroud comprises:


a shroud body defining a lengthwise extending passageway therethrough;
a pin carrier adapted to be mounted upon said ferrule proximate said shroud
body; and
at least one guide in connected to said pin carrier and extending through the
passageway d
efined by said shroud body.
A gender selectable fiber optic connector according to Claim 4 wherein said
pin carrier comprises a carrier ring which encircles said ferrule, and wherein said at

least one guide pin comprises a pair of guide pins connected to said carrier ring and
extending through the passageway defined by said shroud body.
A gender selectable fiber optic connector according to any one of Claims 1-5
wherein said shroud includes an outwardly extending alignment key.
A gender selectable fiber optic connector according to any one of Claims 1-6
wherein said ferrule and the passageway defined by said shroud are both substantially

circular in lateral cross-section, and wherein at least a portion of an exterior surface
of said shroud is rectangular in lateral cross-section.
A shroud for mounting upon a forward portion of a cylindrical ferrule, the

a shroud body defining a lengthwise extending passageway; and
at least one guide pin partially embedded with said shroud body and extending
lengthwise through the passageway defined by said shroud body. said at least one

guide pin also extending beyond at least one end of said shroud body,

   wherein the passageway defined by said shroud body has a substantially
