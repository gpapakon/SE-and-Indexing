<ABSTRACT>
Electric motors having a laminated stator core (19) have on their end surfaces electrically insulating end discs (23) against which the winding overhangs of windings (7, 9) rest. These end discs (23) have connection housings (23) with chambers for the connection of free ends of the winding wires (61, 63) and other connecting wires (65, 67). Manufacture of such a laminated stator core (19) is simplified and made cheaper by means of an automatic machine, in that the free end surfaces (71, 73) of the covering parts (11, 13) which close the pole gaps and of the end surfaces (69), which are located over the pole gaps, of the end disc (23) have vertically arranged domes (75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86) for deflecting and guiding the free ends (45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59) of the winding wires (61, 63) and of the connecting wires (65, 67) to the connection housing (25, 27).

Electric motor with a stator plate packet (1) with at 
least two salient poles (3, 5) on each of which there is 

mounted a winding (7, 9) and between which are located 
pole gaps, which by means of inserted cover portions (11, 

13), may be covered with a shape adapted to the round 
configuration of the rotor, and with end discs (23) which 

are electrically insulating and located on the end faces 
(21) of the plate packet, and on which the winding heads 

of the windings (1, 9) abut, and of which at least one 
end disc (23) has at least one connector housing (25, 27) 

with chambers (1, 9, 31, 33, 35, 37, 34, 41, 43) into 
which the ends of the windings (7, 9) and of the 

connector wires are introduced and secured, characterised 
in that the free end faces (71, 73) of the cover portions 

(11, 13) closing the pole gaps and of the end faces (69) 
of the end disc (23) secured above the pole gaps have 

upright domes (75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86) 
for deflecting and guiding the free ends (45, 47, 49, 51, 

53, 55, 57, 59) of the winding wires (61, 63) and of the 
connector wires (65, 67) to the connector housing (25, 

27).

wires (61, 63) in two planes. 
Electric motor according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the end disc (23) has two 

connector housings (25, 27) which, lying diametrically 
opposite one another, are located on the outer edge of
