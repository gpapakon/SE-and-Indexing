<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for lifting a load, rolling it along directionally, and putting it back down includes a removable wheel set (1) designed to interact with an anchoring plate intended to be fixed to the load. The removable wheel set includes a chassis (3) equipped at its front part with lifting and limit stop means, designed to interact with complementary means provided on the anchoring plate, locking means (5) being provided for locking this chassis to this plate, a guiding assembly (6) including two wheels (7) mounted individually on the chassis and a set of link rods (9-10) designed to keep these wheels parallel at all times, an orientable operating bar (11) articulated to the chassis and to the set of link rods, and stiffening means (14) intended, as desired, to immobilise the operating bar relative to the chassis. Such an apparatus can be used in particular for the rolling-along and positioning of equipment to be fastened to the underside of an aircraft.

Device for lifting, steerably moving and 
putting down a load (100) including: 


a removable dolly (1) including a chassis (3), 
a steering system (6) and an orientable maneuvering bar 

(11), said chassis comprising, in a front part, fixed 
anchor means including in the upper part lifting means 

(31A, 31B) and in the lower part first abutment and locking 
means (5, 33, 34), said steering system including two 

steerable wheels (7) mounted in yokes (8) individually 
pivoted to the chassis about substantially vertical shafts 

(8A) offset transversely relative to each other and a 
system of links adapted to hold the wheels parallel at all 

times and including two longitudinal links (9) pivoted to 
the yokes about substantially horizontal shafts (9A) and a 

transverse link (10) articulated at its ends to the 
longitudinal links (9) about substantially vertical shaft 

(10A), said maneuvering bar being provided with a gripping handle 
(24) for use by an operator and being pivoted to the 

chassis by a double pivot (12) and to the transverse link 
(10) about a substantially vertical pivot (13), said 

maneuvering bar and said chassis being further provided 
with complementary temporary locking means (14, 15) adapted 

to immobilize the maneuvering bar in a predetermined 
orientation relative to the chassis, as required, 
an anchor plate (2) including in the upper part 
retaining means (41, 42) and in the lower part second 

abutment and locking means (40), said retaining means being 
adapted to be fitted over the lifting means from above so 

as to form conjointly a temporary pivot with a transverse 
axis disengagable only by lowering of the lifting means 

relative to the retaining means, the first and second 
abutment and locking means being adapted to cooperate to 

lock the chassis and the plate in a movable configuration 
when the retaining and lifting means cooperate, said anchor  

 
plate being adapted to be fixed to one end of the load at a 

height such that when the chassis is in said movable 
configuration the lifting means are higher than the 

retaining means. 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the removable dolly includes immobilizing means 

including brake shoes (9) fastened to the transverse links 
(9) of the steering system and brake plates (25) disposed 

between said brake shoes and the wheels, the braking action 
varying with the downward inclination of the maneuvering 

bar and the transverse link. 
Device according to claim 2 characterized in 
that the brake plates (25) are disposed horizontally and 

held vertically on supports (8B) attached to the yokes. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterized in that the lifting means include at least 

one horizontal shaft portion (31A, 31B) and the retaining 
means include at least one horizontal axis split bearing 

(41, 42) having a downwardly directed entry slot. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that said lifting means and said retaining 

means cooperate in at least two areas offset transversely 
(31A, 41; 31B, 42). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterized in that the first and second abutment and 

locking means include two abutments (33, 34) fastened 
together and an independent abutment (40) adapted to engage 

between said fastened together abutments in said rolling 
configuration, a rod (5) being mounted in one (33) of the 

fastened together abutments to slide between a pulled out 
configuration wherein said rod allows the independent 

abutment to move freely and a pushed in configuration in 
which said rod passes through the other (34) of the 

fastened together abutments and the independent abutment 
(40) in the movable configuration.  

 
Device according to claim 6 characterized in 
that the fastened together abutments are offset 

horizontally from each other and the rod (5) slides 
horizontally. 
Device according to claim 6 or claim 7 
characterized in that the rod is spring-loaded into the 

pushed in configuration. 
Device according to any one of claims 6 to 8 
characterized in that the fastened together abutments (33, 

34) are fixed to the chassis and the independent abutment 
(40) is fixed to the anchor plate (2). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 9 
characterized in that the chassis includes a horizontal 

plate to which is attached a vertical plate (30) carrying 
the lifting means and the first abutment and locking means. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 
10 characterized in that the maneuvering bar is pivoted 

about a horizontal shaft (12A) to a member disposed under 
the chassis and pivoted to the latter about a vertical 

shaft (12B). 
Device according to claim 11 characterized 
in that said maneuvering bar enables a turning angle of the 

wheels relative to a longitudinal plane of the dolly 
greater than the maneuvering angle of the bar. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 
12 characterized in that the complementary temporary 

locking means include a longitudinal bar (14) mounted to 
slide relative to the maneuvering bar and a receiving block 

(15) fastened to the chassis and including a housing (16) 
adapted to receive the front end of the longitudinal bar in a 

pushed in configuration of the latter. 
Device according to claim 13 characterized 
in that said receiving block is fixed under the chassis.
