<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of digital signal processing
and, more specifically, to a method and apparatus for broadcasting, and
synchronizing a VCO to, a serial digital signal.Electronic communication of serial digital data is straightforward if the
sending clock frequency and phase are known by the receiver, but problems
arise when the transmitted data clock frequency and phase are unknown. In
such situations, the exact phase of the sending clock can be inferred by the
temporal positioning of the received data bits, a technique that is currently in
practice. In such a scheme, a receive voltage controlled oscillator is affected by
a phase comparator, detecting the phase of the receive clock on the receipt of
each data bit. The result of this phase comparison can be applied to the voltage
control input of the VCO to achieve the locking of phase of the receiver to the
incoming data. This technique, however, is only useful when the transmitter
clock is within the capture range of the receiver VCO/phase locking loop. The
receiver must have prior knowledge of the expected incoming data rate for
effective phase locking to occur.The transmitted data rate may vary from transmission to transmission,
provided some means is provided to inform the receiving station as to the
approximate sending data rate. Typically, pilot tones precede the data message,
indicating the following data rate, and can be used by the receiving station to
set its receive dock to an approximate frequency, whereby subsequent phase
locking can occur once the data transmission begins.Although a parallel bus is ideal for interconnecting a distributed multichannel
system, for a point-to-point connection, the use of fiber optics is
desirable, particularly as distances increase. An optical fiber is a filament
(e.g., glass or plastic) that is formed in such a way that light is constrained to
travel along it. Signal transmission is achieved by modulating the power of a 
light-emitting diode (LED) or small laser coupled to the fiber. A
phototransistor at the end opposite the LED converts the received light back to
an electrical signal for eventual signal processing.Optical fibers have numerous advantages over electrical cabling. Optical
fibers neither generate, nor are prone to, electromagnetic interference and, as
they are insulators, ground loops cannot occur. On the other hand, electrical
cabling may generate undesirable radio frequency signals.Many fiber optic systems are currently available. One fiber optic system,
