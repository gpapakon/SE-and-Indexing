<ABSTRACT>
The hygroscopic cartridge (1) particularly for filters for medical use, has a band-like element (2) which is wound to form a flat bobbin (7). The band-like element (2) has a first band (3), formed with corrugations (4) which extend in a transverse direction with respect to the longitudinal extension of the band-like element (2) and made of a heat-conducting plastically deformable material, and a second layer (5) impregnated with hygroscopic salts. The corrugations (4) define small channels (8) for allowing the passage of an aeriform flow in a transverse direction with respect to the plane of lay of the flat bobbin (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hygroscopic 
cartridge for filters in medical use. As known, in many medical applications, and in 
particular in the fields of medicine and surgery, filters 
treated with hygroscopic salts are currently used. The 
filters are employed as humidifying elements to provide a 
respiration process which is similar to the normal 
physiological action of the respiratory tract. Italian Patent Application No. 21794 A/90, filed on 
October 19, 1990, discloses a hygroscopic cartridge for 
filters which is made substantially of a band constituted by 
first and second layers of paper impregnated with 
hygroscopic salts. The layers are superimposed and have 
mutually opposite corrugations forming a plurality of 
channels which extend transversely with respect to the plane 
of lay of the bobbin. This type of filter, which has proved to be valid in 
some respects, is however not devoid of inconveniences. It 
is relatively difficult to manufacture since the channels 
are created by forming corrugations on paper bands and thus, 
during winding, the channels may be crushed such that the 
transverse cross sectional passage area of the channels is 
substantially reduced. A further disadvantage resides in the fact that, during 
inhalation, air entering the filter creates a significant 
drop in the temperature of the filter cartridge, with a  
 
consequent increase in condensation and a reduction in the 
moisture content of the aeriform flow which the patient 
breathes. SE-C-201960 discloses a hygroscopic cartridge 
comprising a band which is wound to form a flat bobbin, 
whereby said band comprises a first layer, having 
corrugations which extend in a transverse direction with 
respect to the longitudinal axis of the band and a second 
layer impregnated with hygroscopic salts, said corrugations 
defining channels for an aeriform flow in a transverse 
direction with respect to the longitudinal axis of the flat 
bobbin. WO 85/03880 discloses an instrument which is 
intended to be held totally or partially in the mouth of the 
individual and the size of which is such as to impair the 
ability of the individual to swallow or to speak normally. 
The instrument is provided with gripping surfaces which are 
so arranged and positioned as to enable the instrument to be 
moved to a position in the mouth in which swallowing 
functions and speech can be performed in a substantially 
normal manner, solely with the aid of the muscles of the 
oral cavity. EP-A-205072 discloses a respiratory heat and

<CLAIMS>
A hygroscopic cartridge (1) for 
filters in medical use, comprising a band-like element (2) 

which is wound to form a flat bobbin (7), said band-like 
element (2) comprises a first layer (3), having corrugations 

(4) which extend in a transverse direction with respect to 
the longitudinal axis of said band-like element (2), and a 

second layer (5) impregnated with hygroscopic salts, said 
corrugations (4) defining channels (8) for an aeriform flow 

therethrough characterised in that said first layer (3) is made 
of a heat-conducting plastically deformable material, and 

said channels (8) are inclined with respect to the 
longitudinal axis (30) of the bobbin (7) so as to cause 

turbulence in the aeriform flow. 
A hygroscopic cartridge according to claim 
1, in which said corrugations (4) are constituted by 

mutually parallel undulations. 
A hygroscopic cartridge according to either 
of claims 1 and 2 in which said first layer (3) is made of 

aluminium foil. 
A hygroscopic cartridge according to any one 
of the preceding claims in which said second layer (5) is 

wound together with said first layer (3) to form said bobbin 
(7). 
A filter for medical use, comprising a 
filter body (20) provided with conduits (23, 24), and a 

hygroscopic cartridge according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
said cartridge being housed in a portion defined by said 

filter body.
