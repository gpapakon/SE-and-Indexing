<ABSTRACT>
An improved injection molding apparatus having a fixed mold 
(7) having a molten resin passage (18) and a movable second mold (8) 

having a molten resin passage (16b) is presented in which residual 
hardened resin left in molten resin passages of the injection 

apparatus is removed automatically after every injection 
operation. The invented device is provided with a reciprocating 

member (34) which is coupled in molten resin passages (16b,18), and 
during the injection step, the molten resin passage (16b) is 

extended to the molten resin passage (18) by moving the 
reciprocating member (34) into the second mold (8) 

to communicate a 
mold cavity (17) with a resin injection device (14). After the 

completion of the injection step, the reciprocating member (34) is 
moved to the back position to remove any resin left in the 

molten resin passage towards the first mold. The mold is then 
opened to separate the fixed mold (7) from the movable mold (8), 

leaving the reciprocating member (34) in the first mold so as to 

close off the opening of the molten resin passage (18). When the 
molds (7,8) are separated, this arrangement is effective in 

preventing exposing the passage (18) to ambient atmosphere, 
leading to leaking of molten resin from the passage (18) as well 

as preventing inclusion of air in molded products to cause a 
phenomenon called burning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
apparatus for making a molded product in which a molten resin is
transported by a resin injection device into a mold cavity,
comprised by a first mold having a molten resin passage and a
second mold having the product cavity.A synthetic resin forming apparatus in general use to
produce resin products operates by molten resin by means of a
resin injection device into a mold cavity, comprising a first
mold and a second mold, through a molten resin passage disposed
on the first mold. In such a resin forming apparatus, there is
a need to reduce the formation of unwanted debris formed by the
hardened residual molten resin left in the molten resin passage.
For solving such a problem, the present inventors had created a
mold design in which the molten resin passage is extended to the
second mold, and, at the same time, a moving device is provided
as a unit with the second mold such that a rod-shaped member
operates in the molten resin passages to move back and forth in
the molten resin passages.The design of this type of resin molding apparatus is such
that, in the retracted condition of the rod member of the moving 
device, the rod member is disposed in the molten resin passage
of the second mold, and the molding cavity is communicated with
the resin injection device. In the forward condition of the rod
member, the rod member is disposed such that it projects into
the molten resin passage of the first mold. Accordingly, when
performing an injection operation, the rod member is retracted
so that the resin can be injected into the mold cavity by the
resin injection device, and after the injection operation has
been completed, the rod member is thrust forth to return any
residual resin left in the molten resin passage towards the
resin injection device.Since the rod member is disposed integrally with the transfer
device on the second mold side, when the first mold is separated
from the second mold, after the completion of the injection
operation,
the molten resin passage is exposed to ambient air, and
molten resin flows out of the open exposure.Because the molten resin
passage of the first mold becomes open as a result of the first
mold being separated from the second mold, there is a chance of
accumulating unwanted air in the molten resin passage. If the
next molding operation is performed in this condition, the air
is sometimes pumped into the mold cavity before the resin is
charged, and if this happens, the air becomes compressed in the
mold cavity by the molten

A synthetic resin product forming apparatus for
making molded resin products by delivering molten resin to

a separable mold cavity (17) comprising of a first mold
(7) and a separable second mold (8), by means of an injection

device communicating with said first mold through a
molten resin passage (18) provided in said first mold and

extending to said second mold (8), said apparatus comprising:

an independent freely movable reciprocating member (34) positioned
inside said molten resin passage (18) and movable between

an injection position, functioning to communicate said
mold cavity with said molten resin passage,

in which the member is
located in

said second mold, and a back position
in which the member is

wholly or partially
located in said first mold; and
a moving device (27) for moving said freely movable reciprocating
member (34) to said back position;

wherein said freely movable reciprocating member (34) is disposed
