<ABSTRACT>
A method of recovering and reproducing a tinning liquid 
containing Fe ions and other detrimental cations by the steps 

of removing cations from the tinning liquid by passing the 
tinning liquid or a diluted liquid of the tinning liquid 

through a strong-acid cation exchange resin to obtain a 
recovered acid, thereafter reproducing the strong-acid cation 

exchange resin and desorbing adsorbed cations into a solution 
containing an acid by passing the acid through the exchange 

resin to which the cations have been adsorbed, precipitating 
and separating Sn ions in the form of a precipitate of an Sn 

compound from the solution into which the cations have been 
desorbed while maintaining Fe ions as ions in this solution, 

mixing and dissolving the precipitate of the Sn compound or a 
compound reduced from the same in the recovered acid to 

reproduce and reuse the mixture of the Sn compound and the 
recovered acid as a tinning liquid, and discharging the 

solution containing Fe ions out of the system of the tinning 
liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of removing Fe ions 
and other detrimental cations accumulated in a tinning liquid 
and in a water washing bath after tinning to recover and 
reproduce the tinning liquid and useful materials, such as a 
plating electric conduction assistant and tin, for reuse. Electric tinning processes are generally grouped into 
alkali lines and acid lines. A halogen bath, a ferro-stann-bath 
or the like is ordinarily used as a plating bath in acid 
lines. Recently, an organic acid (alkanesulfonic acid, 
alkanolsulfonic acid) bath with which an increase in current 
density and insoluble anodization can be achieved has come 
into use. In recent years, however, the problem of 
environmental pollution has attracted more attention, and 
regulations on disposal of waste liquids have become 
stricter. For this reason and because of a high price of 
available acid baths, a need to reduce the amount of waste 
liquid by forming a plating line as a closed system has 
arisen. Also, it is a common practice to add various 
expensive organic additives to a plating liquid for the 
purpose of improving the current efficiency and the plated  
 
appearance. Also for prevention of losses of such expensive 
additives in a plating liquid, recovery of the plating liquid 
is indispensable. However, it has been found that as the operation of 
recovering the entire or a part of a waste liquid and 
returning the recovered liquid to a plating bath in a closed 
system continues, various impurities accumulate in the 
plating liquid and this badly influences the plating quality. 
In an open system such impurities are discharged out of the 
system along with a waste liquid. In particular, Fe ions 
accumulate in the tinning liquid by dissolution during 
predipping of a plating member to be plated (steel plate or 
band) in an acid tinning bath and electro-depositing metal 
tin to the surface of the plated member, by introduction of 
an acid-cleaning water-wash liquid of a pretreatment step 
into the plating liquid and by other causes. Fe2+ ions in a plating liquid are changed into Fe3+ ions 
by air oxidation or anodic oxidation of an insoluble anode, 
as represented by the following formula (1): 
Fe2+ + 1/4O2 + 1/2H2O → Fe3+ + OH- 
However, if Sn ions exist in the plating liquid, Fe3+ ions 
oxidize Sn ions by a reaction as represented by the 
following formula (2) 
2Fe3+ + Sn2+ → 2Fe2+ + Sn4+ 
Sn4+ ions generated in this manner precipitate in a sludge 
(SnO2). Therefore, it can be considered that substantially
