<ABSTRACT>
An improved battery structure for a multicelled primary 
cell circulating electrolyte battery which provides for uniform 

distribution and rate of flow of the electrolyte to all of the 
cells. Batteries of this type include an intake raceway to 

conduct electrolyte along the edges of the cell plates to 
introduce the electrolyte to all of the cells. The invention 

contemplates the use of a flow restrictor in the form of a 
physical separator between the intake raceway and the cells 

which is interrupted by passages to permit a controlled flow 
of electrolyte to the cells. The passages are sized and located 

responsive to system parameters to provide a uniform flow 
and a predetermined pressure drop at the restrictor which is 

preferably of the order of ten times the pressure drop of the 
electrolyte through the cells.
