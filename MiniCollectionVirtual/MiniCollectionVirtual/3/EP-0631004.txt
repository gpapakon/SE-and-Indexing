<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to wallcovering or 
panel covering fabrics and in particular to an inexpensive 
wallcovering which can be readily manufactured, easily 
installed and has a pleasant aesthetic effect upon 
installation. Various wall-coverings are known in the art. For 
example, US-A-4,330,580 discloses a wall-covering in which a 
textile material, formed by the zig-zags of a crocheting 
machine, is chain-stitched onto a non-deformable backing 
material (such as paper) pre-coated with adhesive. Likewise 
US-A-4,863,777 describes a wall-covering having a coloured 
or printed paper backing sheet to which parallel warp and 
fill yarns are tricot stitched so that the design of the 
paper sheet shows through. The yarns are held firmly in 
place by a polyethylene film on the surface of the paper 
sheet. A further wall-covering type is described in Derwent 
Abstract No 91-253173 (of DD 288635). Here, a warp knit 
textile material is adhesive bonded to a carrier layer. An object of the invention is to provide a wall product 
in which the backing thereof is produced more efficiently, 
economically and provides better geometrics. The present invention provides a wallcovering having a 
weft inserted warp knit fabric as a substrate with the 
inserted weft yarn being cotton with a count in the range of 
18's - 30's. (One example of a weft inserted warp knit 
fabric is set out in US-A-4,611,362). Specifically, the 
wall covering of present invention comprises a face 
material, a substrate fabric and an adhesive between said 
face material and said substrate fabric to maintain the face 
material adhered to said substrate fabric, said substrate 
fabric being a weft inserted warp knit fabric with the weft 
inserted yarn being cotton with a count in the range of 18's  
 
- 30's. The face material may be a plastics material or 
paper, but is preferably vinyl material. Desirably the warp knit fabric is chain stitched. Other objects and advantages of the invention will 
become readily apparent as the specification proceeds to 
describe the invention with reference to the accompanying 
drawing, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the stitch 
arrangement of the supporting textile product of the 
wallcovering; Figure 2 is a bottom view of the wallcovering, and; Figure 3 is a cross-section view taken on line 3-3 of 
Figure 2. Looking now to the drawings, the reference numeral 10 
refers to a wall covering with a face or outer material of 
plastic film or paper material 12 having a knit, weft 
inser
