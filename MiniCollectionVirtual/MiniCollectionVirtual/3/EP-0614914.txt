<ABSTRACT>
Inter and/or intramolecular cross-linked esters 
of acid polysaccharides are disclosed in which a 

part or all of the carboxy groups are esterified 
with hydroxyl groups of the same molecule and/or of 

different molecules of the acid polysaccharide. 
These inner cross-linked esters of polysaccharide 

acids are useful in the field of biodegradable 
plastic materials, to manufacture sanitary and 

surgical articles, in the cosmetic and 
pharmaceutical fields, in the food industry and in 

many other industrial fields.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns inter and/or
intramolecular esters of acid polysaccharides
containing carboxy functions, in which a part or
all of such functions are esterified with hydroxyl
groups of the same molecule and/or of different
molecules of the acid polysaccharide, thus forming
lactone or intermolecular ester bonds. These
"inner" esters of polysaccharide acids, in which
there is no intervention by OH groups of other
alcohols, can also be defined as "auto-crosslinked
polysaccharides", since the formation of a mono- or
polymolecular cross-link is the consequence of the
abovementioned internal esterification.
The adjective
"cross-linked" refers to the crosswise connections
between the carboxyls and hydroxyls of the
polysaccharide molecules. GB 1042864 discloses the preparation of polysaccharide derivatives, namely
carboxymethyl ethers of starch, amylose and amylopectin which are crosslinked by
esterified carboxymethylether linkages.GB 1086323 describes the preparation of a carboxymethyl cellulose derivative
insoluble in water by adjusting the pH to generate free carboxyl groups and heating
to condense an appropriate proportion thereof with hydroxyl groups. The inner esters
obtained according to the invention
can be total or partial,
depending on whether all or only part of the
carboxy functions are esterified in the above
manner. In the partial inner esters, further
carboxy functions can be either totally or
partially esterified with monovalent or polyvalent
alcohols, thus forming "external" ester groups, and
in the partial esters of both these ester groups
the non-esterified carboxy functions may be free or
salified with metals or organic bases.Esterification between different polysaccharide
molecules consequently increases their molecular
weight, which can be roughly doubled or multiplied
according to the number of molecules involved in
the crosslinking. The degree of "polymerization"
varies according to the conditions used in the
preparation procedure described hereafter, such as
temperature, reaction duration, but it may likewise
depend on the polysaccharide to be crosslinked.
Even though it is impossible to ascertain the ratio
between the two types of ester bonds, an
approximate representation can be made on the basis 
of the molecular weight, this being proportional to
the number of molecules of the polysaccharide
aggregate of the abovesaid bonds of intermolecular
inner esters. Particularly important are the
crosslinked products obtained according to the present invention,
resulting from

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of cross-linked polysaccharide products, said
polysaccharide being selected from alginic acid, carboxymethylcellulose and

carboxymethylchitin, wherein the process comprises:

(a) treating said polysaccharide with an activating agent to form an
intermediate activated derivative of said polysaccharide in which the

hydroxyl group of the carboxyl moiety is replaced by a group which is
more electron withdrawing; and
(b) subjecting said intermediate activated derivative to heat or irradiation to
produce the crosslinked polysaccharide.
A process according to claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the carboxy groups
in said polysaccharide are salified.
A process according to claim 2, wherein said at least a portion of carboxy groups
are salified with an alkaline or alkaline earth metal, or with a quaternary ammonium.
A process according to claim 1, wherein said treatment with an activating agent
is performed in the presence of a catalyst.
A process according to any of claims 1-4, wherein said activating agent is a
carbodiimide, ethoxyacetylene, Woodward's reagent, or chloroacetonitryl. 
A process according to any of claims 1-4, wherein said activating agent is a 2-halogen-N-alkylpyridinium
salt, in which the halogen is selected from the group

consisting of chlorine and bromine and the alkyl has a maximum of 6 carbon atoms.
A process according to claim 6, wherein said activating agent is a chloride of 2-chloro-N-methylpyridine
and reacts with a tetrabutyl-ammonium salt of the

polysaccharide in the presence of a tertiary amine base.
A process according to claim 1, wherein said aprotic solvent is a dialkylsulfoxide
or a dialkylamide of a lower aliphatic alcohol with an alkyl having a maximum of 6

carbon atoms.
A process according to claim 1, wherein dimethylsulfoxide is used as said
solvent.
A process according to claim 1 in which the reaction is carried out at room
temperature.
A process according to any one of claims 1-10, wherein subsequent to said
cross-linking reaction, at least a portion of any remaining free carboxyl groups in said

cross-linked polysaccharide are salified or esterified with a mono- or polyvalent alcohol.
