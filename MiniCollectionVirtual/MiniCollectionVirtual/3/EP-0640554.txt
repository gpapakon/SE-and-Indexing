<ABSTRACT>
A single beam aerial work platform with a base structure (60), 
top structure (80), and at 

least three scissor mechanisms (14). The extending means (116) for 
raising the top 

structure (80) relative to the base structure (60) is attached between 
the first or lower 

scissor mechanism and the third or top scissor mechanism. The extending 
means (116) are attached by mounting means (100,108) at an offset 

to the pivot points and 
structural members of the scissor mechanisms (14). An additional 

stress reducing 
beam (90), attached parallel to one of the structural members of the 

middle scissors 
mechanism, reduces the horizontal bending stress in the structural 

members of 
the scissor mechanisms (14) and the connecting pin loading in the scissor 

mechanism pins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of aerial work
platforms of the scissors lift type and particular to a
a scissors lift comprising:
a top structure; a base structure; at least first, second and
third scissor mechanisms interconnected between the top
structure and the base structure and each having first and
second beams and center connecting means pivotally connecting
the first and second beams at central portions thereof;an extending means having first and second ends;upper and lower mounting means for mounting the extending means
to the scissors lift; and first and second pivot means for
pivotally connecting said first and second ends of said
extending means to the upper and lower mounting means,
respectively; each of said first and second beams having lower
end portions and upper end portions; the lower end portions of
the first and second beams of the first scissor mechanism being
pivotally connected to the base structure; the lower end
portions of the first and second beams of said second scissor
mechanism being pivotally connected to the upper end portions
of the first and second beams of said first scissor mechanism by
end connecting means; the upper end portions of the first and
second beams of said second scissor mechanism being pivotally
connected to the lower end portions of the first and second
beams of said third scissor mechanism by end connecting means.Aerial work platforms are often utilized to enable a person to
access areas high above reach to install fixtures, perform
maintenance, or the like. Unlike a ladder, which must lean 
against a solid object or have a second set of supports to be
free standing, an aerial work platform is self contained,
mobile, stable, and provides a large platform surface upon which
the user can work. The disadvantages of most aerial work
platforms are their physical size both when collapsed and
extended and the amount of energy required to activate their
extending means to raise the platform to the desired height.A prior art aerial work platform of the scissors lift type
comprising the features of the precharacterizing clause of claim
1 is disclosed in EP-A-0 356 761. The extending means of the
scissors lift known from EP-A-0 356 761 is a hydraulic cylinder
means. One end of the hydraulic cylinder means is pivotally
mounted to the base structure whereas the other (upper) end of
the hydraulic cylinder means is pivotally mounted to an upper
mounting means which is directly fixed to one of the beams of
the lower (bottom) scissor mechanism.FR-A-2 385

<CLAIMS>
A scissors lift comprising:

a top structure (80);
a base structure (60);
at least first, second and third scissor mechanisms (120, 130,
140, 150, 160, 170) interconnected between the top structure

(80) and the base structure (60) and each having first and
second beams and center connecting means (20, 22, 24) pivotally

connecting the first and second beams at central portions
thereof;
an extending means (116) having first and second ends;
upper and lower mounting means (100, 108) for mounting the
extending means (116) to the scissors lift; and
first and second pivot means for pivotally connecting said first
and second ends of said extending means (116) to the upper and

lower mounting means (100, 108), respectively;
each of said first and second beams having lower end portions
and upper end portions;
the lower end portions of the first and second beams of the
first scissor mechanism (160, 170) being pivotally connected to

the base structure (60);

second scissor mechanism (140, 150) being pivotally connected 

to the upper end portions of the first and second beams of said
first scissor mechanism (160, 170) by end connecting means (34,

54);
the upper end portions of the first and second beams of said
second scissor mechanism (140, 150) being pivotally connected

to the lower end portions of the first and second beams of said
third scissor mechanism (120, 130) by end connecting means

characterized in
 that said lower mounting means (108) are
mounted both to the center connecting means (20) of said first

scissor mechanism (160, 170) and a first connecting means
(34) pivotally connecting one of the first and second beams of

the second scissor mechanism (140, 150) to one of the first and
second beams of the first scissor mechanism (160, 170) so as to

distribute stresses to said center connecting means (20) of the
first scissor mechanism (160, 170) and said first end connecting

means (34),

that said first pivot means are spaced from said center
connecting means (20) of the first scissor mechanism (160, 170)
