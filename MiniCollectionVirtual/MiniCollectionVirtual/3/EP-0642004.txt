<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sound emission transducer and to a coupling method. The sound emission transducer (1) forms an assembly unit and is especially designed for the measurement of high-frequency sound emissions (up to about 2MHz). It consists of a piezoelectric measuring element (9), a sound transmitting base (8) with a circumferential coupling diaphragm (7) and a cast compound (10) partially enclosing the measuring element (9). A mounting screw (3) is used to fasten the transducer. The coupling diaphragm (7) is located in a step (14) of the housing (2), whose bottom surface (5), in the case of an unstressed diaphragm (7), has a spacing from the object to be measured corresponding to the elongation (s) (15). The coupling of the sound emission transducer (1) to the object to be measured (15) is carried out such that the bottom surface (5) is pressed onto the object to be measured (15) by tightening the screw (3) and is fastened to the object, as a result of which the diaphragm (7) is stressed and the mounting base (8) is coupled to the surface of the object to be measured (15). The invention enables miniaturisation and more efficient production of the transducer and an improvement of the high-frequency sound transmission.

Acoustic emission transducer with a housing (2) forming
an assembly unit comprising a piezoelectric measuring element

(9), an acoustic transmission base (8) with coupling diaphragm
(7), and an encapsulant (10) enclosing the piezoelectric

measuring element (9) as indispensable components, whereby the
coupling diaphragm (7) lies in a recess (14) of the housing

(2) whose bottom surface (5) is at a distance (s) from the
measuring object (15) when the coupling diagram (7) is

unstressed, and the housing (2) has a side part with a hole
(4) for fixing the transducer by means of a mounting screw (3),

so that the coupling diaphragm (7) is preloaded and the
acoustic transmission base (8) is pressed with defined force

against the surface of the measuring object (15), its pressing
force being unaffected by the tightening torque of the mounting

screw (3).

coupling diaphragm (7) is stressed, and the acoustic transmission

base (8) is coupled to the surface of the measuring object (15)
with an exactly defined force.
