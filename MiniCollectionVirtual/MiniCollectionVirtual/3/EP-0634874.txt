<ABSTRACT>
A motion estimating method serves to determine a set of target 
motion vectors between a current and its previous selected 

frames, wherein N number of frames are skipped between the 
current and the previous selected frames, said N being a 

positive integer inclusive of 1. This method is implemented 
through the use of all frames, i.e., the current and the 

previous selected frames and the N number of skipped frames in 
order to obtain a series of motion vectors for one of the 

search blocks within the current selected frame. Said series 
of motion vectors is then summed up to define a target motion 

vector representing the displacement between said one of the 
search blocks and the corresponding best matching block in the 

previous selected frame. The process is repeated until the set 
of target motion vectors for all of the search blocks 

contained in the current selected frame are detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for determining for a video signal a set of target motion
vectors, in particular in a video encoder employing frame
decimation and interframe coding techniques for data
compression, as described in more detail in the first
paragraph of claim 1 and claim 2.As is well known, transmission of digitized video signals
can deliver video images of much higher quality than the
transmission of analog signals. When an image signal
comprising a sequence of image "frames" is expressed in a
digital form, a substantial amount of data is generated for
transmission, especially in the case of a high definition
television system. Since, however, the available frequency
bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited,
in order to transmit the substantial amounts of digital data
through the limited channel bandwidth, it is inevitable to
compress or reduce the volume of the transmission data. Among
various video compression techniques, the so-called hybrid 
coding technique, which combines temporal and spatial
compression techniques together with a statistical coding
technique, is known to be most effective.Most hybrid coding techniques employ a motion compensated
DPCM(differential pulse code modulation), two-dimensional
DCT(discrete cosine transform), quantization of DCT
coefficients, and VLC(variable length coding). The motion
compensated DPCM is a process of determining the movement of
an object between a current frame and its previous frame, and
predicting the current frame according to the motion flow of
the object to produce a differential signal representing the
difference between the current frame and its prediction. This
method is described, for example, in Staffan Ericsson, "Fixed
and Adaptive Predictors for Hybrid Predictive/Transform
Coding", IEEE Transactions on Communications, COM-33, No.
12(December 1985); and in Ninomiya and Ohtsuka, "A Motion-Compensated
Interframe Coding Scheme for Television Pictures",
IEEE Transactions on Communications, COM-30, No. 1 (January
1982).Specifically, in the motion compensated DPCM, current
frame data is predicted from the corresponding previous frame
data based on an estimation of the motion between the current
and the previous frames. Such estimated motion may be
described in terms of two dimensional motion vectors
representing the displacement of pixels between the previous
and the current frames. Several methods for estimating the displacement of an
object in a video sequence have been proposed.

A method for determining for a video signal a set of
target motion vectors between a current frame (F4)

and its previous selected frame (F1), wherein in accordance
with a frame decimation method a number of

N frames are skipped between the current and the
previous selected frame, N being a positive integer

inclusive of 1, each frame being divided into a plurality
of search blocks of identical size, which

method comprises the steps of:

(a) storing the N skipped frames;
(b) setting one of the search blocks taken from the
plurality of search blocks in said current selected

frame (F4) as a reference search block
(SB4) and setting said current selected frame as

a starting frame;
(c) determining, for the reference search block, a
best matching block (SB3) included in a corresponding

search region (SR3) in an ith skipped
frame (F3) which is the temporally closest previous

frame to said starting frame, thereby generating
an ith motion vector (MV3) representing the

displacement between the reference search block
and the associated best matching block (SB3) in

said ith skipped frame, and thereafter setting
said ith skipped frame as said starting frame and

said best matching block as the reference search
block, wherein i is a number selected in ascending

order, the smaller values of i being related 
to the temporally closer frames to the current

selected frame;
(d) storing the ith motion vector;
(e) repeating said steps (c) through (d) above until
the first to the N+1th motion vectors are obtained;
(f) summing up the N+1 motion vectors so as to provide
a target motion vector representing the displacement

between said one of the search blocks
of said current selected frame and the corresponding

best matching block in the previous selected
frame (F1) ; and
(g) repeating said steps (b) through (f) above until
the set of target motion vectors for all of the

search blocks in said current selected frame is
detected.
A motion estimating apparatus for a video signal for

(F4) selected from the current selected frame and
the N skipped frames, and a corresponding search region 

(SR3) from its temporally closest previous
frame (F3) selected from the N skipped frames and

for the reference search block, the best

matching block (SB3) included in said corresponding
search region, thereby generating a respective one

of N+1 successive motion vectors which represents
the displacement between the reference search block

and said best matching block;
wherein said starting frame is initially determined
as said current selected frame, and, after detection

of said best matching block and said one of

successive motion vectors so as to provide a target

generation means and means for storing and summing

up, for generating and storing said target motion
vector for each of the search blocks in said current

selected frame.
