<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises first and second stations (1 and 5) which are provided with transmitting means (2 and 6) for transmitting 
light signals to be transmitted, and receiving means (3 and 7) for receiving the light signals. The two stations (1 and 5) are 

connected by at least two optical transmission lines (10 and 20) having first optical switches (11 and 21) and second optical 
switches (12 and 22) installed on both ends thereof, and having light paths (10a and 20a) and square light paths (10b and 20b) for 

alternate route. By use of the first and second optical switches, the optical transmission routes through which the light signals are 
transmitted are switched over from the optical paths to the spare optical paths for connection. For the optical transmission lines 

(10 and 20), first and second control means (30 and 35) are provided in the first station and the second station in order to detect 

the light signals, and switch over on each of the receiving means sides the first and second optical switches in accordance with the 
level of the detected light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical line
switching system for automatically switching optical
lines when the optical line is broken or when the
optical line is transferred due to hindrance in two
sets of optical transmission line pairs each set of
which has an optical line and a standby optical bypath
line.In the conventional optical communication system,
two stations which have a transmitter for transmitting
optical signals to be transmitted and a receiver for
receiving the transmitted optical signals and are
several kilometers away from each other are connected
by many units of optical transmission line pairs, one
unit consisting of two sets of optical transmission
line pairs which has first and second optical switches
at each end of the optical line and the standby
optical bypath line.In this optical communication system, when the
optical line of any one unit is broken, or when
transfer due to hindrance takes place, that is, when
the existing optical line installed between two
stations is temporarily removed due to road work etc. 
by bypassing the optical line in the work section, it
is necessary to switch the optical line to the standby
optical bypath line.In this case, the optical signal is switched from
the optical line to the standby optical bypath line
substantially at the same time by synchronously
switching over the first and second optical switches
of each optical transmission line pair.In the aforementioned optical line switching
system, however, a communication optical fiber as long
as several kilometers connecting both optical switches
is required for each optical transmission line pair
because the first and second optical switches are
synchronously switched. In addition, communication
equipment is required to operate both the optical
switches. Therefore, the system becomes large-scale,
and the cost increases in building the optical line
switching system.Further, in the aforementioned optical line
switching system, if a fault occurs in the
communication optical fiber, the first and second
optical switches cannot be operated; as a result,
switching of the optical line cannot be performed.JP-A-59151543 discloses a system wherein stations
are connected by a pair of optical fibres, one of these
fibres representing a bypass line. The stations monitor
transmissions on the main optical fibre and switch to
the bypass line if the main fibre fails.JP-A-60144030 discloses a system wherein stations
are connected by a conduit containing two main optical
fibres and two bypass fibres, the latter
