<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a swim fin including a flipper part (1) extended by a blade, the blade of which consists of the assembly of at least one flexible blade element (2) and at least one blade stiffener element (3) which are arranged edge-to-edge and joined together by the overmoulding on the adjacent edges of a suitable binding material (4). It also relates to a method for preparing composite swim fins.

Swimming fin comprising a shoe (1) prolonged by 
a blade, characterized in that the blade is a three-material 

blade constituted by the assembly of at least 
one flexible blade element (2) and at least one 

stiffening blade element (3) which are arranged edge to 
edge by their longitudinal edges, which are oriented 

substantially in the direction of the length of the fin 
and rendered integral by the overmoulding of an appropriate 

bonding material (4) over the adjacent edges. 
Swimming fin according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the blade elements (2, 3) are arranged side by 

side. 
Swimming fin according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the blade elements (2, 3) are fitted into each 

other. 
Swimming fin according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the blade elements (2, 3) are fitted by an 

assembly of the mortise-and-tenon type. 
Swimming fin according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the adjacent edge forming the mortise (21, 31) 

comprises an enlarged region in which a groove is made. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the flexible blade element (2) is 

made of EVA. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the stiffening blade element (3) 

consists of a thermoplastic "elastomer" material. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the appropriate bonding material 

(4) is a thermoplastic material, preferably a  
 

polypropylene-based one. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the flexible blade element (2) is 

made of EVA, possibly with vinyl added, the stiffening 
blade element (3) is made of polypropylene and the 

bonding material (4) is a polypropylene-based 
thermoplastic material. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the three blade elements (2, 3, 4) 

are polypropylene-based. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the bonding material (4) and shoe 

(1) consist of the same material. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the blade elements are arranged 

symmetrically with respect to a longitudinal mid-plane 
perpendicular to the blade plane. 
Swimming fin according to Claim 12, characterized 
in that the blade comprises a flexible blade element (2) 

flanked by two stiffening blade elements (3). 
Swimming fin according to Claim 13, characterized 
in that the flexible blade element (2) represents more 

than 60% of the total surface area of blade, preferably 
between 80% and 95% of the total surface area. 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 13 and 
14, characterized in that the ratio between the thickness 

of the stiffening blade element (3) and that of the 
flexible blade element (2) lies between 1.5 and 3.5, 

preferably lying between 2 and 2.5. 
Swimming fin according to Claim 15, characterized 
in that the bonding material (4) partially covers the 

flexible blade element (2) in the proximity of the 
adjacent edge and is contained in the prolongation of the 

stiffening blade element (3). 
Swimming fin according to Claim 12, characterized 
in that the blade comprises a stiffening blade element 

(3) flanked by two flexible blade elements (2). 
Swimming fin according to one of Claims 1 to 17, 
characterized in that the blade elements (2, 3) and the  

 
shoe (1) are arranged appropriately, so that each fin, 

left or right, is the mirror image of the other. 
Method of manufacturing a swimming fin according 
to one of Claims 1 to 18, characterized in that the blade 

elements (2, 3) are assembled edge to edge so as to form 
a fin blade, and then in that the bonding material (4) is 

overmoulded, simultaneously or successively, over the 
adjacent edges of the blade elements (2, 3) and the shoe 

(1). 
Method according to Claim 19, characterized in 
that the bonding material (4) and the shoe (1) are 

moulded simultaneously.
