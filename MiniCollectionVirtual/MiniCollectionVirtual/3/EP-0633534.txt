<ABSTRACT>
A method of searching the structure of a stable composite composed of a biopolymer and ligand molecules, which method 
comprises: (1) the first step of covering all modes of hydrogen bonding between a biopolymer and ligand molecules by covering 

all of the possible combinations of matching between dummy atoms positioned at the hydrogen-bonding heteroatoms of the hydrogen-bonding 
functional groups of the biopolymer and the hydrogen-bonding heteroatoms of the ligand molecules; (2) the second 

step of estimating the modes of hydrogen bonding between the biopolymers and the ligand molecules and the conformations 
of the hydrogen-bonding portions of the ligand molecules at the same time by comparing the distance between the dummy atoms 

with that between the hydrogen-bonding heteroatoms; and (3) the third step of finding the structure of a biopolymer-ligand molecule 
composite by substituting the coordinates of all the atoms of the ligand molecules on the basis of the relation of matching 

between the hydrogen-bonding heteroatoms of the ligand molecules and the dummy atoms for each of the modes of hydrogen 
bonding and the conformations estimated in the second step into the coordinate system of the biopolymer. This method permits 

the structure of a stable biopolymer-ligand molecule composite to be searched efficiently and accurately in a short time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for searching stable
docking models of biopolymer-ligand molecule complex that can be
utilized in designing the structures of drugs, pesticides, and other
biologically active compounds.Strong binding of drugs and biologically active substances to
their target biopolymers is required for the appearances of their
bioactivities. The biopolymers include pharmacological receptors which
take part in signal transmission between cells, as well as enzymes,
cytokines and other proteins, complexes comprising these proteins as
main components, and nucleic acids. Since 1960, the steric structures
of a large number of biopolymers have been revealed at the atomic level
by X-ray crystallographic analyses and the structual data thereof have
been stored in the Protein Data Bank and published.Small molecules which can be bound to these biopolymers are
called ligand molecules. The ligand molecules include candidate
molecules for drugs such as drug molecules to be synthesized in future,
as well as drugs, substrates and inhibitors of enzymes, coenzymes and
the like.For the stable binding between the biopolymers and ligand
molecules it is required that the shapes of cavities which exist in the
steric structures of biopolymers and into which ligand molecules are 
bound (hereinafter referred to as "ligand-binding sites") should be
complementary to the shapes of the ligand molecule surfaces as in the
case of locks and keys and that there should be interactions between
the both molecules which result in specific affinity therebetween. It
is known from the crystallographic analyses of biopolymer-ligand
molecule complexes that among these intermolecular interactions,
hydrogen-bond, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and the like
are particularly important. In drug design and structure-activity
relationship study, it is very important to know whether a compound
molecule can form a stable complex with its target biopolymer and, if
so, what kind of binding mode the complex has (i.e., which functional
group in the ligand-binding site of the biopolymer interact which
functional groups in the ligand molecule in what kind of mode) and how
stable the complex is. In conformationally flexible ligand molecules,
it is also important for drug design to determine the conformation of
the ligand molecules bound to target biopolymers (active conformation)
and such a determination must be made at the same time as searching
stable binding modes.It is known that when the complexes have the most stable

A computer based method for generating stable docking models of biopolymer-ligand
molecule complex, which comprises the steps of: (1) searching possible

hydrogen-bond schemes between a biopolymer and a ligand molecule by
preparing possible combination sets of hydrogen-bonding heteroatoms in

the ligand molecule with dummy atoms located at the positions of
