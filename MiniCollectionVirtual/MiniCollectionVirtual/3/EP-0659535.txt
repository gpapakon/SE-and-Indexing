<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a blow-moulded coolant hose consisting of a number of polymer layers with great hydrolysis and bursting pressure resistance for engines, in particular vehicle engines. It has been established that, surprisingly, multilayer hoses with a combination of differently active layers of different thickness made of suitable polymers, e.g. with a non-swellable inner layer which is inert for coolant and a rigid supporting, especially bursting-pressure resistant outer layer, are particularly suitable. These layers must be mutually compatible or connected by an intermediate layer which is compatible with the two layers. Such hoses according to the invention have preferably been blow-moulded in a known manner after coextrusion of their layers made from the various polymers and after placing the tube or hose blank in any desired mould, the so-called 3-D-hose manipulation.

Coolant hose formed from a plurality of layers of thermoplastically
processable polymers, characterised in that it is produced by extrusion

blow moulding, combined with 3-D tubular manipulation, the wall
thickness ratio of the layers being variable over the length of the hose,

the hose comprising at least one inner layer, which is non-swellable
and is inert relative to the cooling agent, and one outer

unburstable layer formed from polyamide, and the polymers of the inner
and outer layers clearly differing in respect of their flexibility.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the outer layer comprises a homo- or copolyamide, mixtures or blends

thereof.
Coolant hose according to claim 2, in which the homo- or
copolyamides comprise linear aliphatic monomers having 6 to 12 C

atoms, aromatic monomers having 6 to 12 C atoms or cyclo-aliphatic
monomers having 6 to 20 C atoms.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the inner layer comprises halogenated or non-halogenated homo- or

copolyolefines, mixtures or blends thereof, which have functional groups
which make said layer compatible with the outer layer.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the outer layer comprises polyamide 6, and the inner layer comprises a 

polyolefine or copolyolefine having grafted-on Î±-unsaturated
dicarboxylic acids or their derivatives.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the inner layer comprises halogenated or non-halogenated homo- or

copolyolefines, mixtures or blends thereof, which are not compatible
with the outer layer, an intermediate layer, which is compatible with both

these layers, being disposed between the inner and the outer layers.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the inner layer comprises chlorinated or fluorinated homo- or

copolyolefines or PVC.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the inner or intermediate layer, which is compatible with the outer layer,

is a polyolefine or respectively a copolyolefine provided with functional
groups by grafting or copolymerisation.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the wall thickness of the outer unburstable layer makes up 10% to 95%,

preferably 25% to 95%, of the total wall thickness.
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it has, at least in part, an annularly or spirally

undulated wall. 
Coolant hose according to one of the preceding claims, in which
the inner layer comprises polymers of the group ETFE, PTFE, PVDF,

PPS, PPE, POM, EVOH, EVA, PBT and their blends.
