<ABSTRACT>
1. Package for rod-like articles, in particular cigarettes. 2.1. Hinged-lid boxes are the customary type of packaging for cigarettes or similar articles (29). To arrange a multiplicity of articles (29) spaced apart inside the package, supporting walls (32, 33) are arranged spaced apart in one box part (10) of the package. The articles (29) project through coaxially arranged cutouts (34, 35) in the supporting walls (32, 33) and are thus positioned precisely relative to one another. 2.2. The supporting walls (32, 33) are part of a supporting insert (42) which consists of a blank and, at the same time, also forms a collar (38) arranged inside the box part (10).

Hinge-lid pack for stick-shaped articles, such as 
cigarettes, with a pack part (10) and a lid (11) which is 

connected in an articulated manner to a rear wall (15) of 
the pack part (10), with a collar which consists of a 

collar front wall (39) and collar side tabs (40) and 
which is fixed in the pack part (10) by means of a lower 

region, and with at least one transversely directed 
supporting wall (32, 33) which is arranged within the 

pack part (10) which is part of a blank for the collar 
(38) and is connected to the collar front wall (39) via 

a folding line (50), which has the following features: 

a) two transversely directed supporting walls (32, 
33) are arranged within the pack part (10) at a 

distance from one another, 
b) the two supporting walls (32, 33) have recesses 
(34, 35) each for the passage of one article 

(29), 
c) the recesses (34) of one supporting wall (32) are 
arranged coaxially with respect to the recesses 

(35) of the other supporting wall (33) such that 
each article is held by the two supporting walls. 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the articles (29) are arranged at 

a distance from one another in two rows (30, 31) within 
the pack, the supporting walls (32, 33) having recesses 

(34, 35) arranged in rows and lying in pairs in the same 
transverse planes. 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the recesses (34, 35) are formed in  

 
the supporting walls (32, 33) by punching, punched parts 

(37) remaining connected to the supporting walls (32, 33) 
by means of residual webs (36) and being directed within 

the pack into a position transverse to the supporting 
walls (32, 33), especially between the rows (30, 31). 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the two supporting 

walls (32, 33) and the collar (38) consist of a common 
blank which forms a supporting insert (42) for the pack 

part (10) by means of three-dimensional folding, one 
supporting wall (32) adjoining the collar front wall (39) 

at the bottom via the folding line (50), and the 
supporting walls (32, 33) being connected to one another 

by means of a vertical intermediate piece (45) which 
bears against a rear wall (15) or a front wall (13) of 

the pack part (10). 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the blank for the 

supporting insert (42) corresponds continuously to the 
width or transverse dimension of the collar (38), 

including the collar front wall (39) and collar side tabs 
(40, 41), lateral folding tabs (43, 44, 46) formed in the 

region of the supporting walls (32, 33) and of the 
intermediate piece (45) being folded into a transverse 

position, in such a way that the folding tabs (43, 44, 
46) are folded one above the other or bear next to one 

another against side walls (16, 17) of the pack part 
(10). 
Hinge-lid pack according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the supporting 

insert (42) has in the lower region, in particular 
adjoining one edge of the lower supporting wall (33), a 

spacer tab (47) which bears against the front wall (13) 
or rear wall (15) and which reaches as far as the bottom 

wall (14) and preferably has the contour of a recess (48) 
formed in the region of the collar front wall (39).
