<ABSTRACT>
A proposal is made, especially for the combination of cold-cathode ionisation sensors and Pirani sensors, to obtain a measurement range which is unequivocal in both directions and is significantly enlarged in comparison with the measurement ranges of the respective sensor types, to use a weighting technique in the transition region ( DELTA P) of the respective sensor measurement ranges, by means of which the sensor characteristic curves are continuously transferred into each other (UA) in a manner which is unequivocal in both directions.
