<ABSTRACT>
a) Corner seal device at the junction of two partition walls. b) Sealing device characterised in that:   - the heel (31) has folded-over edges (32, 33) bearing against the two surfaces of the dihedron and forming a slide, - a longitudinal locking member (4) fixed at the arris of the dihedron and coming into an intermediate position between the surfaces of the dihedron is equipped with fastening elements (41), - a lock (6) sliding longitudinally in the slide (34, 35) of the heel (3) on its rear face side and fastening onto the fastening elements (41) of the locking member (4) in order, through its translation, to pull the heel (3) into the corner of the dihedron to be sealed off.
