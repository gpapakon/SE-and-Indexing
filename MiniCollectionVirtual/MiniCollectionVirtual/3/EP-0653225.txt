<ABSTRACT>
This method is characterised by the steps consisting in:   - measuring (16) the filtered amplitude of the detected activity (15), - adjusting (16) the detection threshold to a predetermined fraction of this measuring amplitude, - counting (17) an absolute refractory period following this detected activity, - counting (18, 19) a refractory noise period following this absolute refractory period, - restarting (21, 25, 19) this refractory noise period in the event of detected activity exceeding the detection threshold during the refractory noise period, and - incrementing (24) the detection threshold in the event of detection (21) in the refractory noise period, so as to increase the detection threshold above the amplitude of the noise.

A method of automatically adjusting a cardiac signal detection threshold in
an implantable device such as a heart stimulator, a cardioverter, or a

defibrillator, the method comprising the steps consisting in:

c) timing (17) an absolute refractory period following detected activity;
d) timing (18, 19) a noise refractory period following said absolute
refractory period;
e) restarting (21, 25, 19) said noise refractory period in the event of
detected activity exceeding the detection threshold during the noise refractory

period; and
f) implementing (24) the detection threshold in the event of detection
(21) occurring during the noise refractory period, so as to increase the

detection threshold to above the amplitude of the noise;

the method being characterized in that step c) is preceded by the steps
consisting in:


a) measuring (16) the filtered amplitude of the detected activity (15);
and
b) adjusting (16) the detection threshold to a predetermined fraction of
said measured amplitude.
A method of automatically adjusting a detection threshold for cardiac
signals in an implantable device such as a heart stimulator, a cardioverter, or

a defibrillator, the method comprising the steps consisting in:

waiting for the appearance of spontaneous heart activity during a
given time period (14);
in the event of activity being detected during said period of time:

a) measuring (16) the filtered amplitude of the detected activity (15);
b) adjusting (16) the detection threshold to a predetermined fraction of
said measured amplitude.
c) timing (17) an absolute refractory period following detected activity;
d) timing (18, 19) a noise refractory period following said absolute
refractory period;
e) restarting (21, 25, 19) said noise refractory period in the event of
detected activity exceeding the detection threshold during the noise refractory

period; and 
f) implementing (24) the detection threshold in the event of detection
(21) occurring during the noise refractory period, so as to increase the

detection threshold to above the amplitude of the noise; and
- in the absence of activity being detected during said period of time
and after a stimulation pulse has been delivered:


a) adjusting (30) the detection threshold to a predetermined value;
b) timing (31) an absolute refractory period following the stimulated
activity;
c) timing (32, 19) a noise refractory period following said absolute
refractory period;
d) restarting (21, 25, 19) said noise refractory period in the event of
detected activity exceeding the detection threshold during the noise refractory

period; and
e) implementing (24) the detection threshold in the event of detection
(21) occurring during the noise refractory period, so as to increase the

detection threshold to above the amplitude of the noise.
The method of claim 1 or 2, in which said predetermined fraction of the
measured amplitude lies between one-eighth and one-half, and is preferably

one-fourth.
The method of claim 3, in which step (16) consisting in adjusting the
detection threshold to a predetermined fraction of the measured amplitude

includes the additional step consisting in constraining said detection threshold
to lie between predetermined minimum and maximum values.
The method of claim 4, in which the minimum and maximum values are
respectively about 0.4 mV and about 1.6 mV.
The method of claim 1, including the additional step consisting in omitting
(23, 25) the incrementation step until the noise refractory period has been

restarted some predetermined number of times.
The method of claim 1, including the additional step consisting in omitting
the incrementation step until a predetermined length of time has elapsed

since the end of the absolute refractory period. 
The method of claim 1, including the additional step (28) consisting in
incrementing the detection threshold at the end of measuring (26) the noise

refractory period when said noise refractory period has been restarted some
predetermined number of times.
The method of claim 1 or claim 8, in which the step (24; 28) consisting in
incrementing the detection threshold consists in applying an increment of

about 0.2 mV.
The method of claim 1, in which the duration of the noise refractory period
lies in the range 30 ms to 100 ms and is preferably about 31 ms.
