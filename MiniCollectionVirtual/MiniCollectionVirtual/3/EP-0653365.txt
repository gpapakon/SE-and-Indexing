<ABSTRACT>
A device for the commissioning of piece goods (1) appearing in rows (2) on a product conveyor (3) and transportable individually into commissioning containers (5) by means of a movable or displaceable commissioning appliance (4) works particularly accurately for piece goods (1), such as, for example, boxes, cans, bottles, compact discs, in that the piece goods (1) in each case bearing against a first stop face (6) on an inclined chute (3a) can be picked up by means of the commissioning appliance (4) movable towards a second stop face (7) and can be released above selected removed commissioning containers (5).

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for commissioning piece goods (1)
from goods tracks (3) which are in the form of inclined

chutes (3a) on which the piece goods (1) queue up in a
line against a first stopping surface (6) located on

the chute (3a), with a movable or displaceable
commissioning apparatus (4) having a removal device

bearing a gripper (11), by which, after placing the
commissioning apparatus (4) with the removal device in

front of the corresponding goods track (3), the piece
goods (1) can be removed individually and can be

delivered to a selected, distant commissioning
container (5),

characterised in that in order to remove the piece
goods (1) the gripper (11) of the removal device before

the operation of introduction into the chute (3a) is
pivotable by means of a pivot drive (14) into a removal

position in which a probe (13) which can be pivoted
with the gripper and is arranged on the removal device

comes to lie against a second stopping surface (7)
which is located on the respective end of the chute

(3a) which faces the removal device.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised
in that for the subsequent removal of the piece goods

(1) the gripper (11) in the removal position can be
moved by means of a drive (4a) substantially at right-angles

to the direction of conveyance of the chute (3a)
and in the direction of the piece goods (1).
An apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the probe (13) extends parallel to the

direction of movement (10) of the gripper (11) and is
arranged on the pivotable drive (4a). 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the chute (3a) has an end limit

(8), the inner surface (6a) of which forms the first
stopping surface (6) and the outer surface (7a) of

which forms the second stopping surface (7).
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the chute (3a) is largely closed

on all sides and only in the region of the first
stopping surface (6) has a passage opening (9) adapted

to the external dimensions of the piece goods (1) which
faces the gripper (11) in its removal position.
