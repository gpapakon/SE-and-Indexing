<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for alarming tyre deflation is provided 
in which reliability of an alarm is raised by a 

manner of alarming slightly when tyre deflation is 
small and detection accuracy of a deflation 

detection mechanism is small, while alarming largely 

when tyre deflation is large and deflation is 
detected with large accuracy. The apparatus 

comprises a deflation detection mechanism for 
detecting tyre deflation and an alarm mechanism for 

deciding an alarm level depending on levels of 
detection accuracy of the deflation detection 

mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
alarming a driver of tyre deflation.Safe and comfortable travel can be assured by
keeping the pressures of the tyres on a vehicle at the
values specified. However, deflation of a tyre occurs
occasionally from external damage or incomplete maintenance,
which may seriously influence safety as well
as the comfort of driving. Various kinds of apparatus to
detect tyre deflation and warn a driver have been
devised and marketed, but such apparatus have not yet
spread widely because of the difficulty in compatibility of
cost and reliability.For example EP-A-0239545 discloses a system for
monitoring and indicating acoustically the operating
conditions of a motor vehicle including the pressure of
the vehicle tyres.In particular, with respect to the time period of an
alarm and the reliability thereof, there exists a problem
that it is very difficult to determine how far deflation
should proceed before an alarm is given, since the
degree of deflation for danger depends on vehicle
speed. In other words, if the alarm is scheduled to
sense a small deflation, there is a large merit in respect
of security of safety. Slight deflation is, however, difficult
to detect and a false alarm occurrence causes driver
uneasiness and repeated false occurrences create a
possibility that a driver may then ignore the alarm in a
truly dangerous case. On the other hand, if the alarm is
scheduled not to be given until the deflation proceeds to
a large amount whilst reliability of the alarm becomes
great there exists the problem in that the alarm may be
too late in the case of high speed driving.In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present
invention to provide an apparatus for warning of tyre
deflation in which the reliability of the alarm is raised
without these problems.In addition, it is also an object of the present invention
to provide a reliable apparatus for detecting tyre
deflation in which a balance between the alarm loudness
level and the danger are kept well and the balance
between the accuracy of the alarm, the degree of
urgency for the alarm and uneasiness given to a driver
by the alarm is well set.According to the present invention there is provided
an apparatus for alarming tyre deflation comprising a
deflation detection mechanism for detecting tyre deflation,
a vehicle speed measuring device and an alarm
mechanism for deciding an alarm level depending on
the levels of tyre deflation detected by the deflation
detection mechanism and the vehicle speed.The

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for alarming tyre deflation comprising a deflation detection
mechanism for detecting tyre deflation, 
characterised by
 a
vehicle speed measuring device and an alarm mechanism for deciding

an alarm level depending on levels of tyre deflation detected by
the deflation detection mechanism and on levels of vehicle speed.
A method for alarming tyre deflation on a vehicle comprising determining
and monitoring a deflation level, 
characterised in that
 the
method further comprises determining and monitoring a speed level

of the vehicle, and alarming, wherein the alarm level is decided depending
on levels of deflation levels and levels of vehicle speed.
