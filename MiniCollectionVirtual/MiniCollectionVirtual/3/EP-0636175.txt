<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of inhibiting an activity of a cell regulatory factor comprising contacting the cell regulatory factor with a purified polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprises a cell regulatory factor binding domain of a protein. The protein is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat of about 24 amino acids. In a specific embodiment, the present invention relates to the ability of decorin, a 40,000 dalton protein that usually carries a glycosaminoglycan chain, and more specifically to active fragments of decorin or its functional equivalents to bind TGF beta . The invention also provides a cell regulatory factor designated MRF. Also provided are methods of identifying, detecting and purifying cell regulatory factors and proteins which bind and effect the activity of cell regulatory factors.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Decorin Fragments and Methods of Inhibiting Cell Regulatory FactorsThis invention was made with support of government grants CA 30199, CA 42507 and CA 28896 from the National Cancer Institute. Therefore, the United States government may have certain rights in the invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to cell biology and more specifically to the control of cell proliferation by inhibiting cell regulatory factors.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProteoglycans are proteins that carry one or more glycosaminoglycan chains. The known proteoglycans carry out a wide variety of functions and are found in a variety of cellular locations. Many proteoglycans are components of extracellular matrix, where they participate in the assembly of cells and effect the attachment of cells to the matrix.Decorin, also known as PG-II or PG-40, is a small proteoglycan produced by fibroblasts. Its core protein has a molecular weight of about 40,000 daltons. The core has been sequenced (Krusius and Ruoslahti, Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 83:7683 (1986); Day et al. Biochem. J. 248:801(1987), both of which are incorporated herein by reference) and it is known to carry a single glycosaminoglycan chain of a chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate type (Pearson, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 258:15101 (1983), which is incorporated herein by reference) . The only previously known function for decorin is binding to type I and type II collagen and its effect on the fibril formation by these collagens(Vogel, et al., Biochem. J. 223:587 (1984); Schmidt et al.,J. Cell Biol. 104:1683, (1987)). Two proteoglycans, biglycan (Fisher et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:4571 (1989)) 

and fibromodulin, (Oldberg et al., EMBO J. 8:2601, (1989) have core proteins the amino acid sequences of which are closely related to that of decorin and they, together with decorin, can be considered a protein family. Each of their sequences is characterized by the presence of a leucine- rich repeat of about 24 amino acids. Several other proteins contain similar repeats. Together all of these proteins form a superfamily of proteins (Ruoslahti, Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 4:229, (1988); McFarland et al.. Science 245:494 (1989)).Transforming growth factor β's (TGFβ) are a family of multi-functional cell regulatory factors produced in various forms by many types of cells (for review see Sporn et al., J. Cell Biol. 105:1039, (1987)). Five different TGFβ's are known, but the functions of only two, TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-2, have been characterized in any detail. TGFβ's are the subject of U.S.
