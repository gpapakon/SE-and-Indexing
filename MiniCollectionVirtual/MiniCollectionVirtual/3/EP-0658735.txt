<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plate heat exchanger having channels (ducts) (K1, K2) of cross-flow type which are constructed in a wave shape for one medium 1 between individual plates (1) respectively connected to one pair (P) of plates, and for the other medium 2 in the shape of a tube between the pairs (P) of plates which are combined to form a plate stack (S). The individual plates (1) are provided with a plurality of parallel rows of trough-shaped embossed (stamped) sections (2) extending in the direction of flow of one medium 2. The individual plates (1) are joined to one another to form pairs (P) of plates at their edges (1a) extending transverse to the trough-shaped embossed sections (2), and the pairs (P) of plates are joined to form a stack (S) of plates at the respective other edges (1b) of the individual plates (1). In order to prevent the risk of lasting deformations due to lack of mutual support of the individual plates (1), the embossed sections (2) of neighbouring rows are offset relative to one another in the longitudinal direction. Furthermore, it is ensured by means of self-closed (positive) engagement that neighbouring individual plates (1) do not slip transverse to the longitudinal direction of the embossed sections (2).

<CLAIMS>
Plate heat exchanger with channels through which 
there is a crossflow, which, for one medium, are formed 

in a wave shape between individual plates that are in 
each case connected to form a plate pair and, for the 

other medium, are formed in a tube shape between the 
plate pairs, which are assembled to form a plate stack, 

the individual plates being provided with a plurality of 
parallel rows of channel-shaped embossed sections which 

extend in the direction of flow of one medium, and the 
individual plates being connected to one another to form 

pairs of plates at their edges extending transversely to 
the channel-shaped embossed sections, and the pairs of 

plates being connected to form a plate stack at the other 
edges of the individual plates, characterized in that the 

embossed sections (2) of adjacent rows are offset relative 
to one another in the longitudinal direction. 
Plate heat exchanger according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each individual plate (1) is 

provided with at least one embossed feature (6) formed 
between adjacent rows of channel-shaped embossed sections 

(2). 
Plate heat exchanger according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each individual plate (1) is formed 

with at least one corresponding raised portion (7) and 
depressed portion (8) in the region of the channel-shaped 

embossed sections (2).
