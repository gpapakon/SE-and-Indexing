<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aluminium flakes, aluminium pigments which 
are used for producing water base metallic paints, and water base 
metallic paints and inks. Aluminium pigments, for example to be used for producing water 
base metallic paints and water base metallic inks, 
are described in several prior publications. For example, JP-B-59009729 discloses a process in which an 
aluminium pigment is treated with an aqueous solution containing 
phosphoric acid or its salt. According to this treatment, an 
aluminium pigment which inhibits the production of hydrogen gas 
sufficiently and has a good stability in paint can be obtained, 
but this treatment has defects in that the colour tone of the 
resulting paint film is spoiled by the treatment and in that 
whitening of the paint film occurs when the paint film is dipped 
in hot water due to the poor moisture resistance of the paint 
film. JP-B-85008057 discloses a process in which an aluminium 
pigment is treated with, for example, a phosphoric ester of lauryl alcohol. 
According to this treatment, an aluminium pigment 
having a stability in paint and good colour tone can be obtained, 
but an important defect of very poor paint film adhesion 
(adhesion between the pigment and a paint resin) is found. Techniques for the treatment of aluminium pigments with acid 
phosphoric esters modified with organic functional groups are  
 
also described in several prior publications, but each technique 
is unsatisfactory. JP-B-85015466 discloses a modification of 
phosphoric ester with an aromatic ring-containing functional 
group and an amino group, but this treatment cannot give a 
satisfactory improvement in the paint film adhesion. JP-A-61296072 
discloses an introduction of a carboxyl group into the 
terminal of a modification group, but both the stability in 
paint and the paint film adhesion of the resulting aluminium 
pigment are not satisfactory. JP-B-89054386 discloses a prccess in which an aluminium 
pigment is treated with chromic acid. According to this 
treatment, an aluminium pigment which has good stability in 
paint and gives excellent colour tone to the resulting paint film 
can be obtained, and the paint film adhesion can be improved to 
a practically applicable level. However, since this treatment 
causes dissolution of aluminium flakes having fine particle sizes 
due to a high reactivity of the treatment, a fine aluminium 
pigment having an average particle size of D50 < about 20 Âµm can 
hardly be produced. This is accompanied by serious
