<ABSTRACT>
A laryngeal mask airway is described which is fitted with an evacuation or drainage tube (23) which passes through the back of the mask (10) and terminates concentrically within an inflatable-cuff formation (18') at the distal end (20) of the mask (10). In the case of a laryngeal mask which relies on an inflatable ring (18) to establish a seal around the laryngeal inlet, the inflatable-cuff (18') formation results from sealed passage of the evacuation tube (23) through the distal region of the inflatable ring (18),  the distal end (20) of which is centrally apertured and re-entrantly folded into sealed junction with the distal end (20) of the tube (23). When the mask (10) is inflated, its distal end establishes a cuff, sealing the tube against the upper oesophageal sphincter. In the presently preferred embodiment, an auxiliary inflatable cuff (50) is carried at the back side of the mask end (10), when inflated, establishes a cushioned reference between the evacuation tube (23) and the posterior wall of the pharynx, enabling more effective sealing of the mask (10) to the laryngeal inlet and of the drainage cuff to the oesophageal sphincter, in the circumstance of negative pressure applied to the evacuation tube (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to laryngeal masks, 
illustratively of the varieties disclosed in U.K. Patent 
2,111,394B (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,509,514) and 
in published U.K. Patent Application No. 2,229,367A 
(corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,995,388). Such masks 
are artificial airway devices designed to facilitate lung 
ventilation in an unconscious patient by forming a low-pressure 
seal around the laryngeal inlet. A seal surrounds 
an appropriately shaped mask which fits into the lower 
pharynx and is attached to a tube which emerges from the 
mouth, as for connection to medical gas-supply tubing. In practice, these devices have been successful and are 
now in daily use in hospitals throughout the United Kingdom. 
Such masks have been found effective in achieving a reliable 
airway, preventing obstruction in the unconscious patient. 
As presently used, such masks are especially effective in 
cases where difficulty with the airway is experienced. For 
example, the mask has been found to prevent contamination of 
the lungs by blood or debris during surgery of the nose or 
throat. But it has become apparent that an important 
contraindication to its use is the patient who is at risk 
from vomiting or regurgitation of stomach contents while 
unconscious. Although the device forms an inflatable-cuff 
seal around the laryngeal inlet sufficient to permit  
 
inflation of the lungs during artificial ventilation, the 
seal is not sufficient to prevent lung contamination in the 
event of retching, vomiting or regurgitation. Patients who 
are not adequately starved prior to surgery are thus not 
suitable for use of the laryngeal mask. In such patients, 
an endotracheal tube is still regarded as affording the 
safest protection to the patient's airways. However, 
insertion of an endotracheal tube is not always without 
difficulty, and failure to make a timely insertion can lead 
to death or brain damage. In such cases, the laryngeal mask 
has proven to be life-saving. And, in cases when it has not 
been possible to safely insert an endotracheal tube, it has 
been found possible first to install a laryngeal mask, and 
then to use the tube of the laryngeal mask as a guide, for 
piloted insertion of an endotracheal tube through the mask. My U.S. Patent No. 4,995,388 describes other means 
associated with a laryngeal mask to prevent aspiration of 
stomach contents into the lungs. In essence, such means 
rely upon a combination of improved peripheral continuity of 
seal pressure against the larynx and the

An artificial airway device to facilitate a 
patient's lung ventilation, comprising an airway tube 

(11,31,40,41), an evacuation tube (23,37,46) and a 
laryngeal mask (10,30,43) at one end of the tubes, the 

mask being of generally elliptical configuration and 
comprising a body (13,32,42) and around the edges of 

the body an inflatable peripheral cuff (18,33,44) of 
flexible material adapted for peripherally sealed 

support by and around the inlet of the larynx (17) of 
the patient, the inflatable peripheral cuff being 

generally in a single plane and the airway tube being 
connected to the proximal end of the body with its 

axis at an acute angle to that plane and in 
substantial alignment with the axis of the laryngeal 

inlet, the distal end (20) of the mask being located 
and oriented for sealing against the upper sphinctral 

region of the oesophagus (24), the mask comprising 
also an inflation tube (19,34,45) communicating with 

the peripheral cuff for selective inflation/deflation 
thereof, characterised in that the evacuation tube has 

a sealed passage within a portion of the inflatable 
peripheral cuff and has an open end (23') that is 

peripherally sealed to and surrounded by the 
inflatable cuff at the distal end of the mask.
