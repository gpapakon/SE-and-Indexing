<ABSTRACT>
The coupling device (1) rotationally connects two substantially coaxial shafts (2, 3) in a flexible manner. It comprises a relatively incompressible elastomeric annular member (17), the interior region of which is in engagement, directly or via a toothed belt (15), with the teeth (7, 12) of two pinions (5, 10) respectively secured to the ends of the two shafts (2, 3) to be coupled. The rigidity or elasticity of the coupling device (1) can be adjusted using means for altering the axial and radial compression of the annular member (17). These means include adjusting screws (23) connecting two clamping flanges (19, 20) which cover and grip the annular member (17). Thus an accurate semi-rigid coupling or a flexible coupling is obtained.
