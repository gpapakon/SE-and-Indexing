A method of curling short strands of hair in permanent waving, 
wherein the strand of hair is embraced by a holding strip and curled 

with same and wherein after the curling operation which is effected 
without a curler the holding strip forms the roller, characterised in 

that the end of the strand of hair (20, 112, 120) is fixed to the 
holding strip (1, 50) in the region of its end near the head so that 

the holding strip forms an extension of the strand of hair, that then 
the holding strip is curled, beginning with its end which is remote 

from the head and which is not occupied by a part of the strand of 
hair, and that then the strand of hair is wound into the end of the 

holding strip in the region of the end near the head. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
holding strip has a front surface portion (3) and a rear surface 

portion (4), that means (161) for comb-like guidance of the hairs are 
provided between the two surface portions (3, 4), that the strand of 

hair (20) is firstly introduced between the two surface portions, that 
the holding strip is thereafter moved away from the head, while 

maintaining the width of the strand of hair, until the tips (21) of the 
hairs of the strand (20) are in the region below the upper edge (6) of 

the holding strip (7) and that the strand of hair is then fixed to the 
holding strip. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
curling operation is effected with a curling bar (12, 130) which has a 

slot (10, 11, 131) and which is pushed from the side over the holding 
strip (1, 50) and oriented at a right angle to the longitudinal 

direction of the holding strip (1). 
A method according to claim 3 characterised in that 
orientation of the curling bar (12, 130) at a right angle to the 

longitudinal direction of the holding, strip (1) is effected by the 
curling bar, before the commencement of the curling operation, being 

brought to bear against a delimitation means (7, 107, 156) at the edge 
(6), which is remote from the head, of the holding strip (1, 50).  

 
A method according to claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in that 
the tips (21, 111) of the hairs of the strand (20, 112) are fixed so 

far below the upper edge (6) of the holding strip (1, 50) that in the 
curling operation they are not in the slot (10, 11, 131) of the curling 

bar (12, 130). 
A method according to claim 5 characterised in that the tips 
(21, 111) of the hairs of the strand (20, 112) are fixed approximately 

in the lower third, near the head, of the holding strip (1, 50). 
A method according to claim 1 or one of the following claims 
characterised in that the tips (21) of the hairs of the strand (20) are 

fixed by virtue of being introduced between the front leaf portion (3) 
and the rear leaf portion (4) of the holding strip (1) formed by those 

two and being manually retained there until they are clamped in 
position by the curling action of the holding strip (1, 50). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in 
that the tips (111) of the hairs of the strand (112) are fixed by 

virtue of being laid in the lower region of the holding strip (50) on 
an adhesive strip (102) which is releasable again, and being held fast 

thereby. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in 
that to produce a spiral wave after curling of the holding strip as far 

as a location where the tips of the hairs of the strand are securely 
engaged by the resulting roller (30, 110) and are clamped in position 

on the curling bar (12), the curling bar is so oriented that it 
approximately aligns with the strand (20) of hair, that then by further 

rotation of the curling bar the strand of hair is twisted and then the 
curling bar (12) is again oriented at a right angle to the strand of 

hair (20) which is then wound in twisted form in a spiral shape on to 
the curling bar (12).  

 
A holding strip for curling stands of hair in permanent 
waving comprising a flat element with which the hairs can be gripped 

and curled, wherein the holding strip itself forms the roller, 
characterised by a front leaf portion (3) and a rear leaf portion (4) 

which are connected together along a fold (5) and are of a width of 2 
to 8 cm and a length of 5 to 20 cm and form an extension of the gripped 

hairs, wherein a stop bead (7, 107) is provided at one edge (6) of the 
holding strip for contact with and right-angled orientation of a 

curling bar (12, 130) provided with a slot. 
A holding strip according to claim 10 characterised in that 
provided in an end region of the front leaf portion (3) and/or rear 

leaf portion (4) are holding means (3, 4; 102, 103; 152, 153) with 
which the holding strip can be fixed near the end, remote from the 

head, of the gripped hairs (20, 112, 120) so that it forms an extension 
of the gripped hairs. 
A holding strip according to claim 11 characterised in that 
the holding means are formed by an adhesive strip (102) which is 

disposed transversely at one end of the holding strip and whose 
adhesive layer (104) can be brought to bear against the strip. 
A holding strip according to claim 11 characterised in that 
the holding means are formed by the holding strip (150) being provided 

at its two ends (152, 153) with an adhesive layer (144, 155) which are 
both fixed to opposite sides of the strand (51) of hair and that a loop 

(156) is formed between the two ends (152, 153) of the holding strip 
(150). 
A holding strip according to one of claims 10 to 13 
characterised in that it is formed by a strip (1, 50) whose structure 

has a plurality of openings (2) for liquid to pass therethrough. 
A holding strip according to claim 14 characterised in that 
it is formed by a flat element of mesh-like nature, for example net or 

gauze.  
 
A holding strip according to one of claims 10 to 15 
characterised in that it is produced from a plastics material which is 

resistant to permanent waving and fixing liquid. 
A holding strip according to one of claims 10 to 16 
characterised in that one side of the stop bead (160) is of a comb-like 

configuration (161). 
A holding strip according to one of claims 10 to 17 
characterised in that the front leaf portion (3) has projections which 

extend through openings (2) in the rear leaf portion (4) when the front 
and the rear leaf portions are pressed together.
