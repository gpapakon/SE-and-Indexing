<ABSTRACT>
Innerboot particularly usable for sports shoes 
including at least two elements (3,4), one (4) of which is 

made of a more rigid material and affects at least the inner 
lateral region of the foot. This arrangement provides for an 

innerboot that allows to achieve both optimum fit and 
optimum transfer of efforts to the ski or to the supporting 

frame for the skate wheels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an innerboot 
particularly usable for sports shoes, for example of the 
type as defined in the preamble of the appended claim 1 and 
as disclosed in DE-A-4129270. It is known to manufacture sports shoes, such as for 
example roller skates, ice skates or ski boots, comprising a 
shell and one or more quarters articulated to the shell. These components are usually made of rigid material, so 
that it is necessary to use an innerboot made of soft 
material to improve the fit of the foot. Innerboots obtained by conventional processes or by 
foaming and used particularly in ski boots can roughly be 
divided into complete innerboots for front-entry boots and 
into partial innerboots for rear-entry boots. More specifically, the complete innerboot, in order to 
allow the insertion of the foot, has a longitudinal opening 
located in its front part and covered by a tongue which is 
fixed at the toe of the innerboot. The partial innerboot is constituted by an innerboot 
that surrounds only the front part of the foot and of the 
leg, leaving exposed the ankle and heel regions as well as 
the rear part of the leg. The regions left exposed by the innerboot are protected 
and contained by paddings applied on the rear quarter 
constituting the boot. All these known solutions have the drawback that they 
do not allow an optimum transfer of efforts to the ski or to 
the wheel supporting frame, since the innerboot is made of 
soft material to improve the user's comfort.  
 U.S. patent No. 4,523,392 shows a partial solution to 
this drawback; it discloses an innerboot for sports shoes  
 
having a partially removable element, at its heel region, 
for the insertion of an insert made of plastics which is 
suitable to surround the ankle region. However, this solution has some drawbacks: first of 
all, the rigid element can decrease the comfort of the foot, 
because it affects several parts thereof, including part of 
the rear region of the leg above the heel. Furthermore, the insert is an independent element that 
has to be inserted subsequently in the innerboot with a 
necessarily manual operation: this increases manufacturing 
costs and also forces to store as many inserts of different 
dimensions as there are innerboot sizes in use. The possible use of the insert as an accessory also 
requires it to be stored within bags or containers which are 
in turn placed within bags or containers placed inside the 
boxes with which the boots are marketed: this usually leads 
to loss of the part, thus

<CLAIMS>
Innerboot for sports shoes comprising at least two 
elements (3,4,103,104,203,204,304,404,604,704,803,804,903, 

904), a first element (3,103,203,803,903) made of a soft 
material and at least partially surrounding the outer 

lateral region of the foot, a second element (4,104,204,304, 
404,510,604,704,804,904) made of a more rigid material and 

at least partially surrounding the inner lateral region of 
the foot, and a sole associated with said first and second 

element, characterized in that said second element has at 
least one tab (5,105,205,405) partially surrounding the 

metatarsal or the metatarsal and instep region, and 
extending to the outer region of the foot. 
Innerboot according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second element affects the inner lateral region of 

the user's ankle, a collar (210,310,410,510,610) being 
associated at the upper perimetric edge of said second 

element. 
Innerboot according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said collar (210) affects the front region of the 

tibia. 
Innerboot according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said collar (310) affects the lateral regions of the 

leg and the rear region of the calf. 
Innerboot according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said collar (410) partially affects the inner lateral 

region of the leg and partially affects the front region of 
the tibia. 
Innerboot according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said collar (510) affects the inner lateral region of  

 
the leg and surrounds the front region of the tibia. 
Innerboot according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the second element (704) is 

associated at the perimetric edge of a sole (702) in the 
inner lateral region of the foot, said second element 

extending toward the toe, partially surrounding its inner 
lateral region and subsequently at least partially 

surrounding the metatarsal region. 
Innerboot according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second element is made of a different more rigid 

material than said first element. 
Innerboot according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second element is made of a thicker material than 

said first element, said second element being more rigid 
than said first element.
