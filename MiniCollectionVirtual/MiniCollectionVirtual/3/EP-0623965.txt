<ABSTRACT>
In the housing of a filter realized with helix resonators it is known to locate 
a coupling aperture in the partition between the resonators. According to the 

invention the aperture in the partition is made so that outside the housing a 
milling cutter (33) is positioned at the point of the wall (31) of the housing 

where the partition (32) joins the wall of the housing. The longitudinal axis 
of the cutter extends in the plane of the partition. Then the cutter (33) is 

forced into the housing to a desired depth (H), whereby the cutter cuts an 
aperture in the partition open end at the housing surface, the aperture having 

a width equal to the width of the cutter and a height equal to the distance (H) 
the cutter was pushed. In this way it is easy to make coupling apertures also 

in extremely small sized filters, which are lower than 5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a coupling aperture in the 
partition between the resonators in a radio frequency filter comprising at least 
two helix resonators, through which aperture the resonators are mutually 
coupled by an electromagnetic field in the desired way. A helix resonator or a helix is a transmission line resonator with a physical 
length of about one quarter of a wave length. It is well known to use a helix 
resonator as a tuning element and it is widely used in filters in the high 
frequency band, particularly at 100 to 1000 MHz. A resonator of this kind 
comprises inductive elements; a conductor wound to a helical coil and a 
metallic housing at a distance from the coil. The low impedance (grounded) 
end of the coil is usually connected directly to the metallic housing. The 
opposite end, the high impedance end of the coil is separated from the housing 
and capacitively coupled to it. A connection to the resonator can be made in 
a known way by soldering a signal conductor directly to the helix coil, usually 
to the first turn of the coil. This connecting point determines the impedance 
level of the resonator, and thus the resonator can be matched to the rest of the 
circuit by the selection of this point. This matching, in which the connection 
point forms a tap of the resonator coil, is called tapping and this point is 
called the tapping point. The tapping point can be calculated or determined 
experimentally.  The characteristic impedance of a helix resonator is determined by the ratio 
of the diameter of the coil to the inside dimension of the housing surrounding 
the coil, by the mutual distance of the turns in the coil or the so called pitch, 
and by any dielectric material used as a support for the resonator. The 
resonance frequency of a helix resonator is a function of the physical 
dimension of the coil, of the capacitive structure, and of the distance between 
the high impedance end and the housing. Thus an accurate and exact design 
is required to manufacture a resonator with a specified frequency band. A filter can be manufactured by placing several helix resonators in the same 
housing. A compartment housing can be used to control the electromagnetic 
coupling between adjacent resonators, in other words, each resonator is placed 
in its own compartment so that there is a partition of the housing between 
adjacent resonators. When an aperture, a so called coupling aperture is made 
in the partition so that the aperture has a defined size and a defined
