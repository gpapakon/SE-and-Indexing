<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention concerns a floor board made up 
of a solid wood strip (1) applied on top of a multi-layered 

supporting panel (2), with a mixed structure, 
comprising layers of wooden (L) and non-wooden materials (NL), 

such as metal or composite materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant patent application for an industrial 
invention concerns a floor board made up of a solid 
wood strip applied on top of a multi-layered 
supporting panel with a mixed structure, comprising 
layers of wooden and non-wooden materials, such as 
metal or composite materials. In particular this floor board includes a multi-layered supporting panel 
in which are obtained deep grooves, orthogonal or inclined with respect 
to the longitudinal axis of the board. In fact, as is known, there have been available on the 
market for some time, wooden floor boards made up of 
solid wooden strips, generally glued to multi-layered 
supporting panels in plywood; it being provided that 
sometimes on said supporting panels there be 
transversal incisions which cover almost the entire 
thickness. Moreover, in order to make it easier to match said 
products with those around them, it is provided that 
on the sides of the supporting panel of each floor 
board, there be grooves and corresponding ribs able to 
unite, male and female, with the identical ribs and 
grooves on the adjacent products. These products have given good results and have met 
with considerable success; it is on the basis of these 
considerations that the Company requesting the instant 
patent concluded that it was well worth further 
improving their performance, particularly as concerns 
the specific aspect of undeformability. In fact, at present conventional floor boards are 
sometimes subject, if the level of humidity varies,  
 
to swelling or shrinking which can occur not only 
while they are kept in stock, waiting to be laid in 
place, but also after they have been positioned side 
by side to make up a floor covering. It is obvious that these deformations risk making it 
impossible, in the first case, to use the boards even 
before they have been fitted and in the second case, 
risk jeopardizing the uniformity and stability of the 
floor covering created by using such products. In particular, a drop in the level of environmental 
humidity can lead to the formation of crevices on a 
floor; on the other hand, surface waviness can be 
caused by an increase in humidity or in any case, in 
the presence of a gradient of humidity between the 
opposite surfaces of the boards. At the present time, the only radical solution to the 
problem could be that of increasing the thickness of 
the floor board; however, this solution is not 
advisable in that it does not prove to be very 
practical and it is considerably costly. Wooden floor boards of the
