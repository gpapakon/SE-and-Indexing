<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed primarily to the protection of metal pipelines and,
more particularly, to the protection of pipelines intended for inground implantation against
corrosion and other degradative environmental forces.The patent literature is replete with references to coatings and adhesive wraps for
protecting metal pipelines. A particularly efficacious system for this purpose uses a
rubber-based primer coating on the pipe surface over which a pressure-sensitive rubber-based
adhesive tape is spirally wound.While certainly not intended to be an exhaustive search of the patent art, illustrative
patents will include the following United States Patents assigned to The Kendall Company,
assignee of this invention: 4,472,231; 4,933,235; 4,946,529; and 5,108,809.As described in the patent literature, a typical rubber-based primer coating may, for
example comprise a solution or a dispersion of reclaimed natural rubber and at least one
tackifier in a volatile solvent or mixture of solvents such as heptane, toluene, etc. The
organic solvent solution may be applied to the metal pipe surface by spraying, brushing,
dipping or rugging, after which the solvent is vented by evaporation into the ambient
atmosphere.After the primer coating is applied, an elastomeric pressure-sensitive adhesive tape 
is then spirally wound over the primer coating to provide a protective pipewrap. Most
preferably, the pipewrap will comprise an innerwrap of this description over which a second
or outerwrap of pressure-sensitive adhesive tape is then wound.The adhesive tapes will have an impact resistant backing, e.g. a polyolefin such as
polyethylene, polypropylene, etc. Preferred backing materials comprise high density
polyethylene (HDPE) alone or in combination with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and/or
linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE).Illustrative elastomers (i.e. polymeric materials having rubber-like properties)
disclosed as useful for pipewraps include natural rubber, cyclized rubber, styrene-butadiene
copolymer (SBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer (NBR), chlorinated rubber,
polychloroprene (neoprene), polysulfide rubber, carboxylic elastomers, silicone rubber,
polyurethane rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), reclaimed rubber, butyl rubber,
polyisoprene (synthetic natural rubber), polyisobutylene, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer
terpolymer rubber (EPDM), etc.Suitable tackifiers for providing the desired increased adhesion heretofore disclosed
in the patent literature include the following: rosins

<CLAIMS>
An adhesive tape adapted for protecting the surface of a metal pipe against
degradative environmental forces comprising a first impact-resistant backing material

carrying on one surface thereof, in order, an elastomeric pressure-sensitive adhesive
layer and an outer solid primer layer comprising a synthetic thermoplastic rubber and at

least one tackifier, characterized in that the thermoplastic rubber
is a triblock having styrene end blocks.

pressure-sensitive adhesive layer carried on a second impact-resistant backing material is

laminated to the outer surface of the first backing material.
An adhesive tape as defined in Claim 6 wherein the second adhesive
layer is laminated to the first backing material by means of a second solid primer layer

disposed between the second adhesive layer and the first backing material.
An adhesive tape as defined in Claim 7 wherein the impact-resistant 
backing material comprises a polyolefin.
An adhesive tape as defined in Claim 7 wherein the polyolefin is
polyethylene.
