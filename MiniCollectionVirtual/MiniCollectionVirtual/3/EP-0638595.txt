<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing olefin polymerization
catalysts
having excellent
polymerization activity per catalyst unit weight, and
capable of giving olefin (co)polymers having high molecular
weight. The catalyts may be
supported on a carrier
(hereinafter referred to supported olefin polymerization
catalysts). The
supported olefin polymerization catalysts have excellent
polymerization activity per catalyst unit weight and are
capable of giving (co)polymers having a uniform particle size.
Olefin may be
prepolymerized on the supported catalyst component.Known catalysts used for preparing olefin polymers, e.g.
ethylene homopolymer or ethylene/olefin copolymers, are
titanium-containing
catalysts comprising titanium compounds and organoaluminum 
compounds or vanadium-containing catalysts comprising
vanadium compounds and organoaluminum compounds.Known catalysts capable of preparing
ethylene/olefin copolymers with high polymerization
activity
comprise zirconium compounds and organoaluminum
oxy compounds (aluminoxane), and methods for preparing
ethylene/olefin copolymer using such catalysts have been
proposed, for example, in
JP-A-19309/1983, JP-A-35005/1985, JP-A-35006/1985,
JP-A-35007/1985 and JP-A-35008/1985.Furthermore,
JP-A-260602/1985 and JP-A-130604/1985 propose methods for the
polymerization of olefins using catalysts formed from
transition metal compounds and mixed organoaluminum
compounds comprising aluminoxane and organoaluminum
compounds.When it is intended to produce polyolefins having a
high molecular weight by using the aforesaid conventional catalysts,
it has been proposed to carry out the polymerization at a relatively low
temperature. However, it is difficult to prepare polyolefins having a
high molecular weight with a high polymerization activity,
because the catalyst activity decreases markedly. The catalysts formed from transition metal
compounds and aluminoxanes prepared by the methods of the foregoing
Japanese patent publications have excellent
polymerization activity, particularly polymerization
activity for ethylene, in comparison with the prior art
catalysts formed from transition metal compounds and
organoaluminum compounds. However, because the greater
part of the proposed catalysts are soluble in reaction
systems, the application of said catalysts is limited to
preparation of polymers by solution polymerization in most
cases. When it is intended to prepare high molecular weight polymers,
there is the inconvenience that the solution
containing the resulting
