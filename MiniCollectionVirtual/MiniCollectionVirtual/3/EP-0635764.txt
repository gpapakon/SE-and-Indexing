<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color
electrophotographic apparatus which is applicable to color
printers, color copy machines, color facsimiles, and the like,
and also to image forming units to be used in such a color
electrophotographic apparatus.Color electrophotographic apparatuses generally form color
images by superimposing yellow, magenta, cyan, and black toner
images and transferring them onto a transfer member in
accordance with either the transfer drum system or the
sequential superimpose system.According to the transfer drum system, different color
toner images are sequentially formed on a single photosensitive
member, and then transferred onto a transfer member such as
paper rolled over the transfer drum by rotating the transfer
drum. The relative position of these color toner images is
adjusted by rotating the photosensitive member at the same
speed as the transfer member and by matching the top end of
each color toner.Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 1-252982 shows
a color image forming apparatus which employs the transfer drum 
system. According to this apparatus, a yellow toner image is
first formed onto a rotating photosensitive drum and
transferred onto a predetermined position on paper as a
transfer member rolled over the outer surface of a transfer
drum. Then, magenta, cyan, and black toner images are
sequentially formed on the photosensitive drum and then
transferred onto the predetermined position in the same manner
as the yellow toner image. As a result, a color image is
formed on the paper.The transfer drum system has an advantage of managing
with one photosensitive drum and a single exposure position.
However, as its disadvantages, the neighboring portion of the
developers and the photosensitive member tends to have very
complicated construction because the positional correlation
between the photosensitive member and each of the developers
must be accurate.In addition, troublesome operations for correlative
positioning of the developers and the photosensitive member,
or for adjusting the process conditions are necessary in
maintenance, and another correlative positioning operation
between the photosensitive member and each of the developers
or the adjusting operation of the process conditions are
necessary when the photosensitive member is replaced with
another.In contrast, according to the sequential superimpose
system, an individual image forming unit is assigned to each 
toner color and a transfer member is conveyed on a belt or the
like to pass an image forming
