<ABSTRACT>
An inflatable ball for ball games comprises an outer ball having interconnected parts consisting of twelve equilateral pentagons (1) and twenty equiangular hexagons (2). Each pentagon (1) is enclosed by five hexagons (2) and at the location of the connection between a pentagon (1) and a hexagon (2) the sides connected to one another are of equal length. In order to minimise, and preferably reduce to zero, the difference in stress in the material of the hexagons (2) and pentagons (1) when the ball is in the inflated state, each of the hexagons (2) has three sides (a) of relatively great length connected to a pentagon (1), and three sides (b) of relatively small length connected to a hexagon (2), the length of the short sides (b) being at least 0.69 times the length of the long sides (a), preferably, b = 0.839 a.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an inflatable ball for ball games, in 
particular football, comprising an outer ball having interconnected parts 
consisting of twelve equilateral pentagons and twenty equiangular 
hexagons, each pentagon being enclosed by five hexagons and, at the 
location of the connection between a pentagon and a hexagon, the sides 
connected to one another being of equal length. In a design of this ball which is generally known (see for example DE-A-2 541 889), the hexagons 
are equilateral. It has been found that, in the inflated state, the 
stress in the material of the hexagons is markedly greater than the 
stress in the material of the pentagons. If the ball is kicked, the path 
through which the ball travels, the speed of the ball and the so-called 
spin will depend on the spot where the ball is struck. The behaviour of 
the ball when it bounces is also dependent on whether the ball strikes 
the ground with a hexagon or a pentagon. It will be obvious that such 
uncertainty is undesirable, in particular with top sportsmen. The 
difference in stress and the degree of stretch in the material of the 
hexagons and pentagons can be explained by imagining what happens if a 
perfectly spherical inner ball is inflated inside the outer ball 
consisting of pentagons and hexagons. It appears that the hexagons come 
into contact with the inner ball sooner than the pentagons, while when 
the pentagons are touching the inner ball in only one spot, the hexagons 
are already touching the inner ball with a relatively large surface. Another disadvantage of the difference in stress and the degree 
of stretch in the material of the hexagons and pentagons is that the 
seams between the hexagons themselves are subject to greater forces and 
consequently split and wear more quickly than the seams between the 
hexagons and the pentagons. In addition, the hexagons on average wear 
more quickly than the pentagons, and the same goes for the protective 
coating layer. Apart from the behaviour of the ball regarding flight, 
bounce and wear, the spherical shape is also improved. The conventional 
football is not completely spherical and during the production process a 
certain number of balls are rejected as they do not meet set tolerance 
requirements in respect of roundness, weight and position of the centre 
of gravity. The object of the invention is to avoid the abovementioned 
disadvantages and to provide an inflatable ball as indicated in the 
preamble, whose hexagons and pentagons - in the inflated state of
