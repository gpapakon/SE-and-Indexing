<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to spectacle rims of simple design for mounting spectacle glasses (spectacle lenses). The production of this spectacle rim is performed starting from a single-piece metal or plastic strip (7) which, for example, may be drawn and whose two ends are interconnected. This metal or plastic strip for the production of the rim is designed such that it can be bent into the desired contour when the spectacle glasses are mounted and mounts the spectacle glasses in a reliable manner. The strip (7) has a left-hand section (11) with a ledge (ridge) (8) which is integrally formed at the top and which can be accommodated by a groove in the edge of the spectacle glass. In addition, a right-hand section (12) of the strip (7) is provided which forms the lower part of the spectacle rim. The strip (7) may be bent in various ways, resulting in various contours for the spectacles.

Spectacle rim for use in a spectacle frame consisting of 
a one-piece strip of metal or plastics material bent to 

a closed shape and comprising a first wide and a second 
smaller portion, characterised in that the first portion (11) 

has an approximately rectangular cross section and comprises 
a ledge (8) with triangular or semicircular cross 

section integrally formed at the mid region of the inner 
side of the strip (7), that the second portion (12) comprises 

a cross section rounded at the outer side which 
on the inner side corresponds to the shape of the ledge 

of the left portion (11), that the strip (7) comprises 
a third portion joined up with the second portion (12) 

and being short relative to the latter, the cross-sectional 
shape of which corresponds to the cross-sectional shape 

of the first portion (11), and that the first portion (11) 
is connected to the third portion in such a manner that 

the first portion (11) forms the upper part of the frame 
and the second portion (12) forms the lower part. 
Spectacle rim for use in a spectacle frame as claimed 
in claim 1, characterised in that the second portion (12) 

comprises an approximately drop-shaped cross section 
which tapers towards the upper side or is rounded. 
Spectacle rim for use in a spectacle frame as claimed 
in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that this rim is constructed 

in such a manner that it, after bending, can be 
incorporated in a groove in the margin of the spectacle 

lens (13) in the region of the ledge (8) facing the 
spectacle lens at the inner side when framing the spectacle 

lenses, and also the second portion (12) forming the lower 
part of the spectacle rim can be incorporated in a groove 

in the margin of the spectacle lens (13).
