<ABSTRACT>
Safety syringe comprising a cylindrical tubular chamber 
(1), a breakable plunger (2), breakable at a weakened 

section (9), and a syringe-needle holder (6) which is fixed 
in the front part (5,5') of the chamber (1) and which has, 

in its back side, a hollow section that cooperates with 
a shank (13) which axially protrudes from the plunger (2) 

in a manner as to fit into the hollow section of the syringe-needle 
holder (2) to retract same upon drawing the plunger 

(2) until the needle (7) is found completely inside the 
chamber (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a safety syringe, of 
the type comprising a chamber with a tubular cylindrical 
configuration, a plunger within said chamber being able 
move along the length of the chamber, and a syringe-needle 
holder fixed to the end of the syringe opposite that of 
plunger. More specifically, the syringe of the invention is 
of the type comprising a breakable plunger, which prevents 
the re-use of the syringe, and which provokes the retraction 
of the needle into the interior of the chamber, after the 
first forward or injection movement, thus preventing additional 
accidental pricks or injuries. To effect this, the 
front end of the plunger has a section that connects with 
the syringe-needle holder. Within the area of the present invention, syringes 
with the section connecting with the holder comprising the 
forward section having end clamps capable of externally 
grasping the holder upon reaching the maximum penetration 
point in the chamber and drag said syringe-needle holder 
backward upon initiating the return or backward movement 
of the plunger. Mentioned combination, although assuring a good performance, 
could result in increase manufacturing costs. The present invention provides a safety syringe of 
type above indicated, having a retractable needle and breakable 
plunger, the plunger having a unit that connects with 
the syringe-needle holder, said unit having a very simple  
 
form, such that it allows considerably reducing manufacturing 
costs. According to the present invention, the end of the 
plunger which connects with the syringe-needle holder comprises 
longitudinally ribbed shank, having the same size 
throughout its length and preferably greater than the depth 
of the syringe-needle holder. This shank protrudes coaxially 
from the injecting head or end of the plunger and has 
a maximum radius cross-section equal to, or slightly superior, 
than the internal redius of the syringe-needle holder. 
This shank's extreme preferably tapers in its configuration 
through a progresive reduction of the size of its ribs. The shank may be composed of equal radial walls, with a 
star configuration, each wall's height being equal or slightly 
greater than the internal radius of the syringe-needle 
holder. Based on the configuration explained, when the plunger 
advances, and upon almost reaching its maximum forward position, 
the shank commences its penetration into the syringe-needle 
holder. When the plunger reaches its maximum forward 
position, the shank will have reached

<CLAIMS>
Safety syringe, of the type comprising a chamber 
(1), of tubular cylindrical configuration, a plunger (2) 

which may be broken at a weakened section (9), and a syringe-needle 
holder (6) fixed to the mouth-end section (4) of 

the chamber (1) by means of a tubular coupling, said plunger 
(2) having an impelling head (12) from which axially protrudes 

an end section or shank (13) which can connect with 

the holder (6) of the needle, characterized in that mentioned 
end section (13) which can connect with holder (6) 

of the needle (7) is composed of a longitunidally ribbed 
shank (13) which is long enough to penetrate at least partially 

inside the syringe-needle holder (6) when the plunger 
(2) is at its maximum inserted position, the shank (13) 

coaxially protruding from the impeller head (12), and has 
a maximum radial cross-section equal to, or slightly greater 

than, the internal radius of the syringe-needle holder (6), 
the shank (13) having one end (15) with a decreasing from 

given a progressive decrease in the height of the ribs. 
Syringe according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the shank (13) is composed of equal radial walls (14), 

which give it a star-type format, each wall (14) having 
a height equal to, or slightly greater than, the internal 

radius of the syringe-needle holder (6). 
Syringe according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the shank (13) has a section (13a), adjacent to the 

impelling head (17) of the plunger (2), of greater cross-section, 
around which is a packing mass (18) of deformable 

elastic material, which hermetically fits against the internal 
wall of the chamber (1), mentioned shank (13) having 

a length such as to protrude beyond mentioned mass (18) 
and the protruding length being sufficient to penetrate 

into the syringe-needle holder (6), at least partially, 
when the plunger (2) reaches its maximum penetration position 

inside the cylindrical tubular chamber (1). 
Syringe according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the chamber (1) is one single unit and has, at its 

front end, opposite the end where the plunger (2) is introduced, 
a tapered housing or ferrule (5') for the holder (6), 

both the ferrule (5') and the holder (6) being slightly 
conical. 
Syringe according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the ferrule (5') is provided with annular lips (19). 
Syringe according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the syringe-needle holder (6) has two sections, one 

being frustroconic and hollow (20), and the other a 
perforated nucleus (22) and radial walls (23) having decreasing 

heights in accordance with the conical form of 
the section (20).
