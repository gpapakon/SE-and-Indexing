<DESCRIPTION>
 CATALYST AND PROCESSThe present invention relates to a catalyst and a process for decomposing an alkanol .Methanol can be catalytically decomposed to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen, mixtures of which are known as synthesis gas . The catalytic decomposition of methanol can be represented as follows : CH3OH - CO + 2H2However the catalytic decomposition of methanol can result in the production of a number of by-products . The formation of these by-products can be represented by the following equations: CO + 3H2 → CH. + H20CO + H20 → C02 + H2 2CH3OH → CH3OCH3 + H20 Methanol has become a widely traded commodity for use primarily in the production of formaldehyde. However it has also found application as a fuel or fuel additive in the transport industry as well as a source of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas derived from methanol has been used in the past as a means of peak shaving in the gas distribution industry. Methanol has also been proposed as a substitute for other fuels used in firing gas turbines . Methanol can be readily manufactured through a series of thermal and catalytic steps from low cost coal, natural gas or biomass. It can also be easily transported and stored.One disadvantage of using methanol as a fuel is that it has a lower heat of combustion than gasoline or natural gas and therefore a larger volume of methanol is required for equivalent energy production. Similarly methanol has a 

 lower* heat of combustion than its decomposition products carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Hence the catalytic decomposition of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen could provide a more efficient means of using methanol as a fuel especially in motor vehicles. Table 1 contains enthalpies of reaction for several methanol decomposition reactions and for the combustion reactions of methanol, synthesis gas, dimethyl ether and methane. The data contained in Table 1 demonstrate that the energy output of methanol can be improved by catalytically decomposing the methanol into synthesis gas, combusting the synthesis gas, using the energy of combustion to do useful work and recovering waste heat for use in the catalytic decomposition of the methanol.TABLE 1: REACTION ENTHALPIES FOR DECOMPOSITION AND COMBUSTION REACTIONSEnthalpy ΔHr (kcal)400°K 800°K Decomposition Reactions2CH3OH → 2CO 4H,2CH3OH -→ CH3OCH3 + H20 2CH3OH → 2CH20 + 2H2Combustion Reactions 2CH3OH + 302 → 2C02 + 4H20 -322 .40 -321.46 2CO •*- 4H2 + 302 → 2C02 + 4H20 -367 . 66 -371. 04 CH3OCH3 + 302 → 2C0, 3H20 -317 . 06 -316 . 832CH< + 402 2CO, + 4H,0 -364
