<ABSTRACT>
In a video signal distribution system in which a plurality of video signals are 
modulated onto individual carrier signals spaced over a band of frequencies to form 

a composite signal for transmission over cables of the system, a point-to-point radio 
link forming part of the distribution system is provided in which the composite signal 

is transmitted as double side band phase modulation of a single microwave carrier 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video signal distribution systems, and in
particular to point-to-point radio links for such systems.In Patent Publication No. WO-A-84/02044 there is disclosed a transmitter
arrangement for allowing the simultaneous transmission of up to seventy-five video
signals on respective sub-carriers in the band 50 to 500 MHZ as single side-band
suppressed-carrier amplitude modulation of a microwave carrier signal.Patent Publication No. JP-A-55-83306 discloses a double side-band phase
modulator arrangement for modulating voice signals. Large amounts of phase
deviation are obtained using relatively simple circuitry.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a point-to-point
microwave radio link system for a video signal distribution system in which a plurality of
video signals are modulated on respective subcarriers of respective different
frequencies spaced over a band of frequencies to form a wide-band composite signal
for transmission along cables of the system, wherein said radio link system
comprises a transmitter arrangement for providing double side-band phase modulated
microwave signals of a single microwave carrier for transmission over the point-to-point
link, the arrangement including: a microwave carrier signal source (1); means (3)
to direct a carrier signal from the source (1) over a first path including level setting means (7)
and a balanced amplitude modulator arrangement (8) for modulation of said carrier signal by video signals and over a second path including
phase adjusting means (4); means (5) to combine the output signals from said first and
second paths; and means (13) responsive to the amplitude of the combined output 
signals to control said phase adjusting means (4) to adjust the phase relationship in
which said output signals are combined such that at least the frequency components of the first sidebands
in respect of a given modulating signal frequency in the combined signals
represents pure phase modulation of the carrier signal by that modulating signal
frequency.A microwave point-to-point radio link system for a video signal distribution system, in
accordance with the present invention, will now be described with reference to the
accompanying drawings, of which:-
Figure 1 shows a transmitter arrangement schematically
andFigure 2 shows a receiver arrangement.Referring first to Figure 1, the first part of the transmitter arrangement consists
of a source 1 of millimetre wave power sufficient to drive the modulator/upconverter.
