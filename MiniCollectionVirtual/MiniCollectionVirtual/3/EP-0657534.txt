<ABSTRACT>
An antiallergic agent containing an active ingredient comprising a peptide capable of combining with human IgE, more 
specifically the α-chain of a high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor or a soluble fragment of the α-chain of a high-affinity immunoglobulin 

E receptor capable of combining with human IgE; an animal cell (1) transformed with a plasmid containing, integrated 
thereinto, both of sFcεRIα having, added to the upstream region thereof, a promoter capable of controlling the expression 

in an animal cell and DHFR having, added thereto, a UK promoter; an animal cell (2) transformed with both of a plasmid containing, 
carried thereon, a DNA coding for an sFcεRIα gene having, added to the upstream region thereof, a promoter capable of 

controlling the expression in an animal cell and another plasmid containing, carried thereon, a DNA coding for DHFR having, 
added to the upstream region thereof, a UK promoter; and a process for mass-producing sFcεRIα by culturing the animal cell (1) 

or (2). The invention can provide a clinically useful antiallergic agent which shuts off allergic reaction in its origin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition 
comprising a peptide capable of binding to human IgE, a method 
of preparing the same and use of the same. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a prophylactic and/or therapeutic 
composition for allergic diseases which comprises a high 
affinity immunoglobulin E receptor α-chain (FcεRIα) or a 
soluble fragment of said high affinity immunoglobulin E 
receptor α-chain which is capable of binding to human IgE 
(sFcεRIα). Type I allergy is an inflammatory response which is 
elicited as the invasion of exogenous agents into the body 
triggers release of various enzymes and chemical mediators, 
such as histamine and leukotrienes, from mast cells and 
eosinophils, which in turn induce tissue-damaging 
inflammations. The allergic response, when generalized, leads to a 
shock state known as anaphylactic shock. The agents which trigger an anaphylactic shock response 
include various drugs such as penicillin and insulin, 
desensitizing allergens such as ticks and fungi, dietary  
 
allergens such as egg and peanut, iodine-containing contrast 
media, local anesthetics and so on. The current pharmacotherapy for anaphylactic shock 
consists in the administration of adrenaline and steroids and 
it is reported that if early therapy be judiciously instituted, 
the prognosis of this condition is generally satisfactory. 
However, these are no more than symptomatic remedies and the 
prophylaxis of anaphylactic shock is considered to be truly 
important. Actually, however, there is no established 
prophylactic modality for anaphylactic shock and the current 
clinical practice appears to be based, at best, on the vague 
concept of preventing the invasion of high-risk foreign agents. Therefore, in patients requiring certain drugs such as 
penicillin and other antibiotics and in cases in which an 
iodine contrast medium is used in X-ray diagnosis, these agents 
are administered of necessity, even knowing the attendant risk 
of anaphylactic shock. Thus, there is a pressing need for a 
positive prophylactic measure against these reactions. In pollen allergy, allergic symptoms occur preferentially 
in the nose and eye. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the 
number of patients who complain of the so-called pollinosis 
symptoms due to pollens of cedar and other allergenic plants, 
such as allergic conjunctivitis and allergic rhinitis (snivel, 
nasal congestion, sneezing).  For the prevention of pollen disease, a prophylactic 
treatment with antiallergic agents, a
