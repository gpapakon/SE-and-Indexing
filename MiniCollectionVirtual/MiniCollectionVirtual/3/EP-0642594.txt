<ABSTRACT>
Molten metal (11) containing suspended liquid particles is passed preferably generally upwardly through a porous media (24) so constructed and arranged such that the movement of the molten metal (11) therethrough renders the suspended liquid particles gravity separable. The gravity separable liquid particles (34) rise upwardly or settle downwardly so as to be removable from said molten metal for subsequent removal therefrom. An associated apparatus is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to separating
and removing suspended liquid particles from
molten metal by passing the molten metal
containing the suspended liquid particles
preferably generally upwardly through a porous
media. The porous media is constructed and
arranged such that the movement of the molten
metal therethrough renders the suspended liquid
particles gravity separable.Molten metal, such as aluminum,
including alloys containing over 50% aluminum,
has been treated to remove impurities therefrom.
Some of these treatments, such as in furnace
fluxing or in-line treatment, generate liquid
particles, such as molten salts. Also,
additions of salts are often made to furnaces to
reduce melt loss. A portion of these molten
salts are carried along with the molten metal
and, if not removed from the molten metal, can
create "oxide patches" on the surface of the
solidifying ingot. These oxide patches not only
adversely affect ingot quality but also many
times have to be scalped off of the ingot, which
results in a reduction of the recovery of metal 
in the ingot casting operation. Oxide patches
can also cause ingots to crack. In some cases,
the oxide patches are so prevalent that the
entire ingot must be scrapped and remelted.
This, of course, adds cost to the ingot casting
operation.The liquid particles referred to, such
as the molten salts, are in the micron size
range, typically from less than 1 micron up to
80 or possibly 100 microns in size. The molten
salts are usually MgCl2, NaCl, CaCl2, KCl, LiCl
and mixtures thereof. The molten salts can also
contain NaF, AlF3 and CaF2 originating from
furnace additives or potroom metal. Most liquid
salts are lighter than the molten metal and
would be gravity separable but remain entrained
or suspended largely because their small size
results in an extremely slow rise velocity.
Other than for their small size, the buoyant
liquid particles would rise to the surface for
removal by skimming or similar operations.There have been efforts to remove
particles, such as solid and liquid inclusions,
from molten metal. United States Patent No.
4,390,364 discloses a removal method comprising
moving the molten metal containing suspended
particles downwardly through a medium of
submerged contacting surfaces such as a packed
bed. The contacting medium has a high void
fraction and a high specific surface area. The
patent states that this results in coalescence
or agglomeration of the suspended particles.
After this, the molten metal is passed generally
downwardly through inclined
