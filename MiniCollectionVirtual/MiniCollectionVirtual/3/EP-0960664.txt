<ABSTRACT>
A press for stamping corrugated profiles into sheet metal, e.g. for fitting to radiators, has a two part construction. A central section is driven by an integral ram (8,9,10) and presses the central part of the profiles via interlocking stamps (12,13) and dies. This action is followed by the whole press head pressing secondary stamps (22,23) into metal sheet each side of the middle profiles. The stamp and die profiles comprise interdigitated plates with rounded edges.

Apparatus (2, 53) for producing rib plates (48, 49, 50, 51) with two
parts, at least the first part (1, 52) being movably disposed with respect to the

second part (3, 57), the first part (1, 52) having at least three bending plates
(12, 13, 22, 23; 54), the second part having at least four counter-bending plates

(36, 37, 38, 39, 40; 58, 59, 60, 61) and a part (1, 52) with a pre-stroke element
(5, 8, 11, 14, 66), 
characterised in that
 the pre-stroke element (5, 8, 11, 14, 66)
comprises a pre-stroke insert (11; 66) connected with the at least one middle

bending plate (12, 13; 54) and at least one piston (8), able to the pressure-impinged,
disposed in a cylinder chamber (5) in each case, acting upon the

pre-stroke insert, and 
in that
 the first part (1, 52) comprises a longitudinal girder
(4) in which the at least one cylinder chamber (5) is disposed.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the first part
(1, 52) is displaceable by means of a press and the second part (3, 57) is

disposed fixed.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the first
part (1, 52) comprises at least two lateral bending plates (22, 23), fixed with

respect to the first part, and at least one middle bending plate (12, 13; 54)
movable with respect to the first part by means of the pre-stroke element (5, 8,

11, 14, 66).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 die cushions (27, 28) are disposed on the first part (1, 52) laterally with
respect to the lateral bending plates (22, 23).
Apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 elastic
elements (29, 30) are disposed between the die cushions (27, 28) and

longitudinal tracks (20, 21).
Apparatus according to one of the claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in
that
 lateral plates (16, 17) connected to the longitudinal girder (4) are disposed 
between the lateral bending plates (22, 23) and the at least one middle bending

plate (12, 13; 54).
Method for producing rib plates by means of an apparatus
according to one of the preceding claims, the first part (1, 52) being designed

movable with respect to the second part (3, 57) of the apparatus for production
of rib plates, whereby the at least one middle bending plate (12, 13; 54),

actuated by a pre-stroke element (5, 8, 11, 14, 66), of the first part surpasses
the lateral bending plates (22, 23) of the first part and forms, at first, at least

one middle rib plate (48, 49) between the middle counter-bending plates (37,
38, 39; 59, 60) and then the lateral bending plates (22, 23) of the first part form

the lateral rib plates (50, 51) between the lateral counter-bending plates (36,
37, 39, 40; 58, 59, 60, 61).
Method according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the pre-stroke
element (5, 8, 11, 14, 66) comprises a piston (8), guided in a cylinder chamber

(5), which is pressure-impinged during formation of the at least one middle rib
plate (48, 49) and is relieved from pressure before the bottom dead centre

during formation of the lateral rib plates (50, 51).
