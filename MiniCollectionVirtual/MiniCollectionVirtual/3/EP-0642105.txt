Method and apparatus for generating a solid model of a 
structural assembly, or solid models of components of such 

assembly, according to cross sectional shapes of the 
components and attributes associated with the cross 

sectional shapes, wherein the components are initially 
defined by wire frame models or surface models represented 

by suitable shape data such wire frame data. When a 
structural assembly is modified in design, the shape data 

are changed, and the corresponding cross sectional shapes

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
generating or modifying a solid model of a structural 
object, and an apparatus suitable for practicing the method 
to generate or modify such solid model. A solid model generator is used in designing a 
structural object or solid such as automotive parts, die 
sets used on a press, or other components of a structural 
assembly. Such a solid model generator includes a solid 
modeller adapted to receive data representative of shapes in 
specified cross sectional planes of the structural object, 
and data indicative of attributes of such cross sectional 
shapes. These shapes and attributes cooperate to define the 
geometry of the object. The solid modeller automatically 
generates a solid model of the object according to the 
received cross sectional shapes and the attributes. When a 
structural assembly such as a part of an automobile or a die 
set used on a press is modified in design for use on another 
type of automobile or for partial re-modelling of the 
automobile, the operator of the solid model generator 
operates an appropriate data input device to identify the  
 
automotive part or die set to be re-designed or modified in 
design, and select each component of the structural assembly 
to be displayed on a display screen. The operator further 
operates the data input device to change the cross sectional 
shapes and attributes of each component to modify the 
component, as needed, so that the solid modeller 
automatically modifies the original solid model, namely, 
automatically generates a solid model of the component as 
modified, and display the newly generated solid model of the 
modified component. The above operation should be repeated 
for each of the components of the structural assembly that 
should be modified in design. The solid model generator indicated above uses a 
general-purpose CAD (computer-aided design) software for 
dealing with the operator's commands to designate the 
desired component to be modified and change object-defining 
parameters in the form of the cross sectional shapes and 
attributes described above. The solid modeller operates also 
according to the CAD software, to generate the solid model 
of the modified component. Since the solid modeller requires 
a considerably long processing time to modify the solid 
model of each component, the operator should wait an 
accordingly long time, at the site of the peripheral data 
input device. Where two or more components of the structural 
assembly in question should be
