<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for regulating the time of charging of the 
output node of an amplifier at start up, commonly 

comprising an external soft-start capacitor charged by 
a current delivered by a pull-up transistor (QG19) of a push-pull 

output stage of the amplifier, through a 
decoupling diode (QG23) that is functionally connected between 

the output node of the amplifier and an armature of the 
external soft-start capacitor, is provided with a 

current mirror feed back circuit capable of mirroring 
a current function of the charge current of the 

external soft-start capacitor on the driving node of 
the pull-up transistor (QG19) of the output stage of the 

amplifier. The regulating circuit permits to use an 
external capacitance of extremely small size and upon 

the reaching of a fully charged condition by the 
external capacitor, the control circuit self-isolates 

and does not influence in any way the normal operation 
of the amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to differential
amplifiers, especially error amplifiers, used in
control and regulation systems, wherein it is necessary
or useful to control, at the power-on instant, the rise
of the voltage on the output node of the amplifier
toward the supply voltage, through the charging of
capacitances associated with the output node.In control and regulation systems, differential
amplifiers (error amplifiers) having an output stage
composed of a pair of transistors functioning in a
push-pull mode (for example a "pull-up" transistor
connected between the output node and the supply rail
and a "push-down" transistor connected between the
output node and ground) and wherein the output node is
often connected directly to the input of a comparator,
are widely used.At start up, an out-of-balance condition of the
inputs of the amplifier, may cause a sudden saturation
rise of the output node toward the supply voltage. A
steep rising of the output voltage toward the supply
may cause undesired over-shoot phenomena of the value
of the parameter controlled by the regulating system.Known solutions generally consist in slowing the
rising of the voltage of the output node, at start up,
either by introducing a circuit device for controlling
the rising (slew rate) of the voltage on an internal
driving node of the amplifier or on the output node
itself, for example by tying the output node voltage to
the voltage of a so-called "soft-start" capacitance
which is charged with a constant current.In many applications, especially in case of error 
amplifiers, the introduction of such a device within
the inner core circuit of the amplifier may present
remarkable difficulties, taking into account that few
millivolts may be sufficient for completely unbalancing
the output stage of the amplifier. In these cases, the
control of the rise time of the voltage on the output
node must necessarily be effected on the output node
itself without altering the core of the amplifier.A solution based on the use of a diode or a PNP
transistor with an emitter connected to the output
node, a collector connected to a common ground node of
the amplifier and a base connected to the armature of
an external "soft-start" capacitor is known. The
external soft-start capacitor may be charged through a
charge path that is functionally external to the
structure of the amplifier. The PNP transistor prevents
a too steep rise of the voltage on the output node of
the amplifier.This known solution has several drawbacks and
limitations. There is
