<ABSTRACT>
A closed-loop accelerometer (10) has a rebalance 
loop (14) controlled by a first clock and the output of 

which loop is supplied to a utilization circuit (24) 
controlled by a second clock (22). The loop and the 

utilization circuit are coupled by a converter which 
converts the output of the loop into a stream of pulses 

distributed over one accelerometer rebalance-cycle 
period, these pulses being sampled over the period of 

the second clock and counted to produce a count which 
is delivered to the utilization circuit (24). There 

are means (29) responsive to the output of the second 
clock (22) for gating the pulse count to the 

utilization circuit (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and 
methods for facilitating utilization of the 
acceleration data output of a closed-loop 
accelerometer. More particularly, this invention 
pertains to apparatus for converting the acceleration 
output to a form that is compatible with output data 
rates whose frequency is unrelated to the period of the 
accelerometer rebalance loop. Many accelerometers include a pendulous proofmass 
for sensing acceleration relative to inertial space. 
Motion of the proofmass relative to the body of the 
accelerometer (and the object attached thereto) is 
induced by acceleration and the displacement of the 
proofmass provides a measure of the acceleration force. 
Such systems are known from, for example, 
US-A-5235330 and US-A-4282470. The displacement versus acceleration 
characteristic of an accelerometer may be highly 
nonlinear. Such nonlinearity may be due to a number of 
factors. For example, in a silicon accelerometer that 
employs a hinged floating element between a pair of 
conductive plates, an inverse square relationship 
governs the force exerted upon the pendulous mass as it 
travels through the gap between charged conductive 
plates. Nonlinearities may also be introduced through 
the bending characteristics of the hinges that attach 
the pendulous mass to the body of the accelerometer. 
Such second order effects can produce a nonlinear 
stiffness response in the bent hinge as the pendulous 
mass is deflected through the gap. In order to improve the accuracy of such 
accelerometers, they are therefore often operated in a 
closed-loop fashion. The force then required to 
maintain the null position of the pendulous mass, 
rather than displacement, provides the measure of  
 
acceleration. A so-called rebalance loop is employed 
for this purpose and many rebalance techniques are 
feasible. Generally, the most effective techniques 
would employ a modulation and forcing process that 
takes place at a specific frequency. The output of the 
accelerometer may be represented by a digital value 
that is equal to the duty cycle of the voltage 
rebalance waveform in voltage rebalance schemes. 
Alternatively, the digital value may represent the 
number of charge quanta applied in charge rebalance 
schemes. Systems of the above type are often subject to 
problems arising from inconsistencies between the 
accelerometer rebalance-cycle period and the data rate 
of the output utilization circuit. The rebalance-cycle 
period is fixed as is the output data rate and the 
resulting
