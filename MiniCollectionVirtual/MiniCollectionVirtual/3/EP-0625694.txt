<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic fluid vibrating flowmeter for measuring a 
flow rate of a fluid to be measured by irradiating ultrasonic 

to the fluid engendering a fluid vibration and by receiving 
a signal of the ultrasonic modulated by the fluid vibration 

comprises a pair of ultrasonic transmitter and ultrasonic 
receiver mounted to a measuring pipe line in a state not 

contacting with the fluid for transmitting and receiving the 
ultrasonic. Driving means intermittently drives the 

ultrasonic transmitter by burst waves containing an 
oscillation frequency to cause the ultrasonic transmitter to 

transmit ultrasonic. On the other hand, standard timing 
means sends out a standard signal for controlling a timing 

for sending out the burst wave and the ultrasonic receiver 
receives an amplitude modulated signal whose amplitude has 

been modulated due to a frequency modulation caused by the 
fluid vibration. After that, an envelope of the amplitude 

modulated signal sampled by a sampling signal synchronized 
with the standard signal and whose sampling point of time is 

changed by a predetermined function is found out and a 
vibration frequency of the fluid vibration is detected from 

this envelope while removing the influence of noises.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic fluid
flowmeter for measuring a flow rate of a fluid to
be measured by irradiating ultrasonic waves to the fluid,
creating a fluid vibration and by receiving a signal of
the ultrasonic waves modulated by the fluid vibration and more
particularly to an ultrasonic fluid flowmeter
improved so that a stable operation may be performed by
effectively removing influences of noise.As a prior art fluid flowmeter disclosed in JP publication No. 48-17010, there is known
to exist a vortex flowmeter for measuring a flow rate of a
fluid to be measured by irradiating ultrasonic waves to vortices
which is one kind of fluid vibration created when the
fluid to be measured hits a vortex generator, by counting the
number of vortices and by measuring the flow rate from the
frequency thereof, or a fluidic flowmeter for measuring a
flow rate of a fluid to be measured by causing a fluid
vibration by hitting a jet produced by jetting the fluid
through a nozzle to a target and by measuring the flow rate
from a difference of pressures generated on both sides of the 
jet by measuring a vibration frequency of the fluid vibration
by using a piezoelectric sensor fixed on an inner wall of a
measuring pipe line.In this specification, the prior art technology will be
explained based on the vortex flowmeter among those prior art
fluid vibrating flowmeters. At first, a vortex flowmeter
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 48-17010
"Flow Velocity Measuring Device" will be taken up and an
outline thereof will be explained below with reference to
Figs. 1 through 3.Fig. 1 is a structural drawing showing a structure of
the prior art vortex flowmeter. In the figure, a vortex
generator 1 inserted in a flow to generate Karman vortices is
illustrated as a columnar object. The reference numeral (2)
denotes vortexes generated by the vortex generator 1, (3) a
measuring pipe line through which a fluid to be measured is
flown, (4) an ultrasonic signal transmitter and (5) an
ultrasonic signal receiver.Those ultrasonic signal transmitter 4 and ultrasonic
signal receiver 5 are mounted to the measuring pipe line 3 on
the downstream side of the vortex generator 1 facing to each
other approximately at a right angle with the flow direction
of the fluid and are composing a detector for detecting the
number of produced Karman vortices (the number of vortices
flown in an unit of time). If there is no vortex on a propagation path of the
ultrasonic signal shown by a dotted line in Fig. 1, its
