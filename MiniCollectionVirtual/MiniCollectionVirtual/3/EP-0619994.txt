<ABSTRACT>
A cover plate (14) is rotatably mounted on a bottom plate (12). The cover plate carries a mat (16) which is fastened on the circumference of the cover plate (14) via a retaining ring (18). The cover plate (14) has an outer edge with a polygonal contour, so that the retaining ring (18) engages under the cover plate (14) at the corners of the polygon only. This results in a number of clamping zones which are spaced apart at the circumference and cavities in between these. The retaining ring (18) can thereby easily be removed from the cover plate (14) by local deformation in order to clean the turning plate (10).

A rotary plate as a seat for the disabled, having a base plate (12), a cover plate (14) 
rotatably mounted on the latter, a padded mat (16) arranged on the cover plate (14) 

in a concentric manner, and a circular holding ring (18) which engages over the 
circumferential edge of the padded mat (16), is detachably secured to the cover 

plate (14) and also engages over the outer edge (46) of the cover plate (14), 

characterised in that the outer edge (46) of the cover plate (14) has a regular, 
polygonal circumferential contour with a plurality of edge portions (24) which are 

of the same length and are at least substantially rectilinear, in that the holding ring 
(18) is in one piece and has a resiliently deformable outer edge (28) which is 

hook-shaped in axial section, engages underneath the cover plate (14) at least at 
the transitions (22) between each two of adjacent edge portions (24) thereof and at 

these transitions (22) contacts with the outer edge (28) [sic- 46] of the cover plate 

(14) in a clamping manner. 
A rotary plate in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the corners (22) 
formed between each two at least substantially rectilinear edge portions (24) of the 

cover plate (14) are rounded. 
A rotary plate in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the outer edge 
(28) of the holding ring (18) contacts with the cover plate (14) at a plurality of 

regions (22) spaced apart along the circumference of the latter, and between every 
two such contact regions (22) a gap (26) is formed between holding ring (18) and 

cover plate (14). 
A rotary plate in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that the width of the 
gap (26) alters in a steady manner in the circumferential direction. 
A rotary plate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the contour of the outer edge (46) of the axially-sectioned cover plate (14) is at 

least substantially semicircular. 
A rotary plate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the outer edge (28) of the holding ring (18) has a clamping surface (42) tapering 

conically towards the base plane of the holding ring (18).  
 
A rotary plate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the holding-ring outer edge (28) - hook-shaped in axial section - has a 

circumferential lip (44) which engages underneath the cover-plate outer edge (46) 
- convexly rounded in cross-section - and, with prestressing, rests against the 

outer edge (46) in an at least substantially linear manner. 
A rotary plate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the holding ring (18) has an inner supporting surface (48) in the transition region 

between its hook-shaped outer edge (28) and the inner edge (30) engaging over the 
padded mat (16), this supporting surface (48) being supported on an upper 

complementary counter surface of the cover plate (14). 
A rotary plate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
the holding-ring inner edge (30) engaging over the padded mat (16) has on its 

inner surface a circumferential rib (34) penetrating into the padded mat (16). 
A rotary plate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that 
in cross-section the inner edge (30) of the holding ring (18) tapers radially inwards 

in a steady manner.
