Coupling adaptor (13) for connecting a 
circuit-breaker (14), in particular a line circuit-breaker, 

to an information-carrying bus, in particular 
to a bus of the European Bus Association, EIBA, wherein 

a bus coupler (4) is connected on the one hand to a 
contact system for electrical and possibly mechanical 

connection to the bus and on the other hand to a 
control electronics element (5) to which there is 

connected a tripping system (6), in particular a 
working current, which operates with a tripping spindle 

(7) for build-on circuit-breakers (14), characterised 
in that the bus coupler (4) is designed so that it is 

connected to the control electronics element (5) for 
the detection of commands and in addition for the 

detection and programmed processing of respective 
measuring signals and state information. 
Coupling adaptor according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the control electronics element 

(5) has additionally a separate terminal (18) for an 
external sensor (8). 
Coupling adaptor according to claim 1, 
characterised in that, within the housing of the 

coupling adaptor, a sensor (8) or measuring elements is 
or are attached to the control electronics element (5). 
Coupling adaptor according to one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the control electronics 

element (5) for the further processing of respective 
measuring signals and state information, has devices 

for loading an appropriate program for processing, 
appropriate in particular for the delivery of turn-off 

commands by way of a bus. 
Coupling adaptor according to claim 4, 
characterised by a device for loading a program for 

processing - by way of a bus. 
Coupling adaptor according to claim 5,  
 

characterised in that the program is permanently stored 
and has interfaces for the entering of parameters.
