<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the procedure
for analyzing a FT-IR-spectrum of an unknown mixture of
gases,about which we do not know the constituent gases,
not to mention their partial pressures. Instead we Know
a large set of library spectra of pure molecular gases,
measured in known pressures and with the same interferometer
as the unknown sample.In FT-IR-spectroscopy in multicomponent analysis
we have the IR-spectrum of an unknown mixture of
gases, about which we do not know the constituent gases,
not to mention their partial pressures. Instead we
know a large set of library spectra of pure molecular
gases, measured in known pressures and with the same
interferometer as the unknown sample. By using these
pure spectra we ought to calculate the partial pressures
of the pure gases in the mixture, with error limits.
The errors in the obtained values arise from the
measurement noise in the spectra. Because the calculation
of such partial pressures that best explain the
mixture spectrum is a relatively simple task, we shall
consider it only briefly and concentrate on the calculation
of their error limits. We shall also consider
the optimal choice of the resolution providing as small
error limits as possible and the application of the
non-negativity constraint for the partial pressures. In
addition to gas spectra, all the calculations apply to
spectra of non-interacting liquids as well. Let us denote by s the measured mixture spectrum
to be analyzed and let {Kj|j = 1,...,M} be the set
of library spectra with which we are trying to explain
s. We assume that all the spectra are linearized, i.e.
that on the y-axis there is always the negative logarithm
of the transmittance (except possibly some constant
coefficient). This means that we are using the
absorbance scale. Then, according to Beer's law, s is
some linear combination of the spectra Kj, or

Our task now is to determine such coefficients xj by
which s is explained as well as possible. After that
the partial pressures of the pure gases in the mixture
are obtained by multiplying the measuring pressures of
the corresponding library spectra by their coefficients
in the linear combination.Because all the spectra are only known at
equally spaced tabelling points υ1,...,υN, s and Kj can
be treated as vectors, and we can state Eq. 1 in vector
form as

This equation can be further simplified by collecting
all Kj-vectors together into a matrix K, which gives us
the matrix equation
Kx = s, 
where

and x is the coefficient (column) vector containing the
coefficient
