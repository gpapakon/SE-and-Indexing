<ABSTRACT>
Procedure for operating an elevator, in which the power for moving the car as well as the accelerating/decelerating power of the whole system is, in all motional states of the elevator, obtained from/returned to a hydraulic pressure accumulator (1) charged by an auxiliary gear (3). The elevator machine comprises a hydraulic pressure accumulator (1), hydraulic actuators (2) for adapting the power taken from/fed into the pressure accumulator to the motional state of the elevator car, and an auxiliary gear (3) for pumping hydraulic energy into the pressure accumulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for operating
an elevator as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and to an
elevator machinery as defined in the preamble of claim 3.At present, the power taken by elevators from the electric
supply netork varies greatly. The power required is at a
maximum during ascent of a fully loaded elevator car, and
this maximum power determines the design of the electrical
eqipment and interface. During descent of the elevator car,
the car can be braked electrically by feeding electric
energy back into the network. Often, however, all of the
kinetic and potential energy of the elevator car is converted
into waste heat in suitable braking devices. AU-PL 4385 discloses a device which uses valves for regulating
the fluid flow from the pressure accumulator to the elevator
drive. However this valve control can not be designated as
hydraulic actuator to adapt the pressure. The use of valves
causes high losses which result in a heating of the valves and
a reduction of the efficiency of the whole device. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the
above-mentioned drawbacks. A specific object of the invention
is to produce a new type of elevator machinery and a
procedure for operating it, enabling the energy consumption
of the elevator and above all its connected load on the
electric network to be reduced.As for the features characteristic of the invention,
reference is made to the claims.In the procedure of the invention for operating an elevator
machinery in the various motional states of the elevator
car, the power required for moving the car as well as the
power for accelerating or decelerating the system is taken
from or returned to a hydraulic pressure accumulator. Moreover,
the pressure accumulator is charged by means of an
auxiliary gear to compensate the losses involved. In other
words, the energy needed for moving the elevator car is
taken from the pressure accumulator, and the energy regained
from the movement of the car is returned to the pressure
accumulator. In this context, 'motional states' of the 
elevator car means the movement of the elevator car during
acceleration, braking and travel at constant speed in the up
or down direction. The term 'system' refers to the elevator
car and the parts moving with it.The auxiliary gear is preferably operated at an essentially
constant power and for relatively long times especially when
heavy loading of the elevator is to be expected. The connected
load of the auxiliary gear on the electric network is
substantiall
