<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 3-oxo-1,4-benzothiazine
derivatives which have protein stabilizing effect and suppressive
effect on lipid peroxide formation, and are useful for treatment
of cataracts etc.The formation of cataracts is an intractable eye condition
where an opacification of the lens is caused and which results in
a loss of visual acuity. Various studies on a causal factor and
mechanism of cataracts, and a treatment method therefor have been
made. But at present, there are very few medical substances
which are effective for cataracts.It is reported that an increase of peroxide in the lens is
related to a cause of cataracts and a chemical substance having
suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation is effective on
treatment of cataracts (Current Eye Res., 5, 37 (1986)). It is
also reported that protein denaturation is observed in lenses of
cataract patients (Ophthalmology, 19, 1283 (1977)).From the reports, a chemical substance which has suppressive
effect on lipid peroxide formation in combination with protein
stabilizing effect can be presumed to be especially useful for
treatment of cataracts. A compound having the above both
effects, however, has not been studied and the development of 
such a compound has been desired.As the result of our precise study to find a compound having
a suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation in combination
with a protein stabilizing effect, the inventors found that
3-oxo-1,4-benzothiazine derivatives, in which the 2nd-position
was substituted by a benzylidene group and the 4th-position was
substituted by an acidic group, which is tetrazolyl, phosphonyl
or sulfonyl, and the phenyl ring of the benzylidene group was
further substituted by hydroxy and lower alkyl groups, exhibited
both effects.Some of 3-oxo-1,4-benzothiazine derivatives having a
benzylidene substituent at the 2nd-position, where the chemical
structure is common to the basic structure of the compounds of
this invention, were reported to show activitity as a herbicide
(U.S. Patent No.3923709), a tranquilizer (Japanese Patent
Publication No. 10671/1974) or a synthetic intermediate of
benzothiazepine derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 72875/1985). The description in the
publications, however, is limited to benzothiazine derivatives
wherein the 4-th position of the benzothiazine ring is
substituted by aminoalkyl or carboxyalkyl. Benzothiazine
derivatives having an acidic substituent, except carboxy group,
have not been reported. Further the prior art discloses neither
