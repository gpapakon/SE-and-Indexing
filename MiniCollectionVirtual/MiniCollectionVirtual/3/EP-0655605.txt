<ABSTRACT>
A source-sensitive gyroscope guides light beams 
emitted from a light emitting device into both ends of the fiber 

coil, makes the beams propagate in the coil clockwise and 
counterclockwise, and retrieves the beams into the light emitting 

device itself. The phase difference is obtained from the change of 
the driving current or the change of the driving voltage of the 

light emitting device, or from the change of a photocurrent of the 
monitoring photodetector mounted behind the light emitting device 

in the light source. The use of Lyot's depolarizer enhanced the 
cost of production. To alleviated the cost, a single birefringent 

medium is adopted as a substantial depolarizer. The birefringent 
medium whose optical path difference longer than the coherent 

length of the light is interposed between the light emitting device 
and the end of the fiber. When the light beams are non-polarized, 

the birefringent medium is aligned in the orientation in which the 
anisotropic axis is perpendicular to the beam line. When the light  

 
beams are linearly polarized, the birefringent medium is arranged 

in the orientation in which the anisotropic axis inclines at 45 
degrees to the linear polarization. When a polarizer is equipped in 

the beam line, the birefringent medium is arranged in the 
orientation in which the anisotropic axis inclines at 45 degrees to 

the linear polarization. In any case, the single birefringent 
medium plays the role of a substantial depolarizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Application No. 321170/1993 filed November 26, 1993, which is 
incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to an improvement of a 
fiber-optic gyroscope acquiring a signal from a light source which 
is now abbreviated to a source-sensitive gyroscope. The 
source-sensitive gyroscope is a new gyroscope which dispenses with 
a main photodiode positioned at an end of the fiber path and 
obtains a phase shift signal from either the change of the 
performance of emission of a light emitting device or the output of 
a monitoring photodiode in the light source instead of the main 
photodiode. A conventional fiber-optic gyroscope usually comprises 
a light source, a first coupler, a polarizer, a second coupler, a 
fiber coil, and a photodetector. The light source includes a light 
emitting device and a monitoring photodetector. The prior  
 
gyroscope guides light beams emitted from the light emitting device 
into an optical fiber. The beams pass the first coupler, are 
polarized into linear polarization by the polarizer, and are 
divided into halves by the second coupler. The divided light beams 
enter both ends of the fiber coil and propagate clockwise (CW) and 
counterclockwise (CCW) in the fiber coil. Then the beams are 
integrated by the second coupler, are polarized again and are led 
to the photodetector which is furnished at an end of the fiber path. 
The CCW beam and CW beam interfere with each other at the 
photodetector. The power of the interfering beams is sensed by the 
final photodetector. The photodetector is positioned at a 
symmetric spot to the light emitting device with regard to the first 
coupler. The light source module has a light emitting device and a 
monitoring photodiode mounted behind the light emitting device. 
The monitoring photodiode aims at detecting the light power of the 
light emitting device for stabilizing the light power. A gyroscope 
has two photodetectors in general, i.e. a main one for detecting the 
object signal of the interference beams and an auxiliary one for 
stabilizing the light power of the light emitting device. To 
distinguish two photodetectors, the main one is now called a main 
photodetector or a main photodiode, and the auxiliary one is called  
 
a monitoring photodetector or a monitoring photodiode. The reason why two couplers are inserted in the 
optical path is to equalize exactly the path of the CW beam to the 
path of the CCW beam. One coupler is still enough to divide light 
beams
