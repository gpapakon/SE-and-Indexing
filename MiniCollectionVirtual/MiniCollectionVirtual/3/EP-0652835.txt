<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle (1) comprising a driving wheel (2) driven by an electric motor (3) whose control circuit (4) is supplied by a generator (6) coupled to a fuel engine (5), and a sensor (18) providing a setpoint signal (SC) corresponding to the position of the accelerator pedal (7) and hence to the setpoint power that the electric motor (3) must supply to the wheel (2). To avoid fitting the vehicle (1) with a high capacity drive battery, means (7, 14 to 16, 19, 20) are also provided corresponding to the setpoint signal (SC) to adjust the rotational speed of the fuel engine (5) to the value for which the latter supplies mechanical power (Pm) equal, firstly, to the setpoint power and, secondly, to a given fraction of its maximum power.
