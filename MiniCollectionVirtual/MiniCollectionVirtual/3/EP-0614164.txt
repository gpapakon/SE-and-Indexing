<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a first object (A) in 
which a plurality of windows (W) are arranged around 

a rotational shaft (C), and a polygonal second object 
(B) so arranged as to be partially observed through the 

windows of the first object (A). The first object (A) and 
second object (B) rotate relatively around the rotational 

shaft (C). Because of optical illusion, a visual effect 
that the polygonal object (B) is perceived expanding, 

contracting, deforming and eccentrically rotating is 
produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the formation of a visual sense effect according
to the preamble of claim 1. Such an apparatus is known from US-A-3 900 978. Particularly,
this invention relates to an apparatus which forms a visual sense effect of enabling
an object of a polygonal shape to be perceived as though it were repeating enlargement,
contraction, deformation, and an eccentric motion by virtue of the illusionary effect in the
visual sense.The apparatus disclosed by US-A-3 900 978 includes a plate having a display, preferably
a five pointed star, thereon. A pair of disks having openings approximating the shape of
the star points are mounted for relative rotation about a common axis centered on the
display. Means are provided for rotating the disks in opposite directions to move the
openings into and out of registry whereby the display on the plate appears, disappears and
reappears in an expectable way.US-A-3 080 474 discloses an apparatus for formation of a visual sense effect having two
objects rotatable to each other wherein a first object is formed by a disc provided with
several windows. The second object is a color disc comprising an opaque body having a
series of uniformly shaped angular openings disposed uniformly about the axis of the disc.
Each opening is covered by a transparent sheet having one of the primary colors red,
green, yellow or blue. The apparatus known from US-A-3 080 474 provides a color effect
and patterns viewable through a large window provided on one side of the apparatus. Its
effect and patterns are produced by a white or nearly white light from a lamp and by
rotating the color disc and the disc with windows at changing relative speed.This invention has for an object thereof the provision of an apparatus for the formation of
a visual sense effect which enables an object of a polygonal shape to be perceived as
though it were being enlarged, contracted, deformed, and eccentrically moved and giving 
rise to strange unexpectedness, since the object is not physically enlarged, contracted,
deformed, or eccentrically moved.This object is achieved by an apparatus for the formation of a visual sense effect having
the features of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments form the subject matters of the
dependent claims.In the present invention, an object of a single polygon as defined in claim 1 which actually
is not being enlarged, contracted, deformed, or eccentrically moved at all is enabled by
virtue of the newly found illusionary phenomenon in the visual sense to be
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the formation of a visual sense effect, comprising:

a) a first substantially flat object (A, A
1
-A
4
, L) having at least one window (W,
W
p
) disposed substantially symmetrically around a first centre (C, C
1
-C
4
), and
b) a second substantially flat object (B, B
1
-B
4
) mounted behind said first object
for being shown partly through said at least one window of said first object, and having a

second centre, wherein said first and second objects are rotatable relative to each other
around an axis of rotation which goes through at least one of the first and second centres,

   characterized in that:

   said second object has the shape of a single polygon which defines a closed
peripheral edge, having apexes being uniformly spaced on a circle having the axis of

rotation as the center thereof, as well as sides, so that at least one part of said edge is
visible through each of said at least one window and so that during relative continuous

rotation in one direction, said apexes and sides of the edge appear and disappear from said
one at least window, thus giving the impression to the viewer that the second object

cyclically expands and contracts.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the at least one window has an
open profile cut-out in the periphery of the first object.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that at least one
window (W, W
p
) or said cut-outs (D), respectively, are adapted to be varied in shape and
arrangement.
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that said first object is
formed of a plate (L) possessing the function of modulating light and consequently allowing

control of penetration of light therethrough and said at least one window (W
p
) or said 
cut-outs (D), respectively, are adapted to be varied in shape and arrangement by an

instruction on display of an image issued from a computer (PC).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said windows are replaced by
mirrors (M), and the second object (B) is mounted in front of and at a distance from the

first object.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that a hologram is recorded
in advance on said mirrors (M).
Apparatus according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
first and second object are optically projected as magnified.
