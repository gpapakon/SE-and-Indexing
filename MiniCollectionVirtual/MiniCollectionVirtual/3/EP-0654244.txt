<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus configured to direct a medical needle onto a 
target inside a living body as indicated by an ultrasound 

imaging device includes an ultrasound transducer and a 
needle guide holding the medical needle, both attached to 

a vertical post by movable arms, an ultrasound imaging 
device and a computer-controller. The arms are provided 

with links connected by universal joints which permit 
positioning by the physician of the transducer and the 

needle guide in any place on the body in the desired 
direction. The position of the components is indicated to 

the computer controller by sensors mounted in the joints 
of the arms or by wireless transmission. The transducer 

issues signals regarding the target point to the imaging 
device which transmits the information to the computer 

controller, the latter adjusting the angular direction of 
the needle trajectory onto the target. The physician 

places the transducer on the body in accordance with the 
image of the target projected on the screen of the imaging 

device, and places the needle point on the skin close to 
the target, whereupon the direction of the needle 

trajectory is automatically adjusted by the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for performing
needle biopsy or aspiration by automatically controlling
the movement of a medical needle as it penetrates the body
guided by an ultrasound imaging device.During recent years interventional ultrasound diagnosis
and therapy has become widely used, and many surgical
procedures have been replaced by more gentle and less time
consuming needle therapy to the benefit of the patient.
Inter alia, ultrasonic imaging of maternal and fetal
tissues has greatly facilitated prenatal diagnosis and
treatment, and ultrasound imaging devices greatly assist
the physician in properly positioning a biopsy needle to
perform amniocentesis, cordocentesis and trans-abdominal
chorionic sampling.There are many different biopsy techniques and needles,
and the needle depends on the type of patient and the
target organ. The method mostly used today is the"free
hand" technique, whereby the transducer is placed at a
certain distance from the entry site of the needle and the
needle is manipulated with one hand. This technique
requires considerable skill and frequently repeated
punctures, unless the target is relatively large or
located superficially. For these reasons and because
manipulation of the needle as guided by an ultrasound 
image requires both hands of the physician, there exists
the trend to design and provide automatic devices for
guiding the needle as directed by the ultrasound beam.Early developed devices include a needle attached to an
ultrasound transducer housing in spaced-apart, articulated
manner, thus enabling the physician to manually direct the
needle onto the desired biopsy location and to insert it
to the required depth. Such devices are, for instance,
disclosed in US. 4,899,756 (SONEC), US. 4,911,173 (TERWILLINGER) and
EP-A-0 025 214. While all of these devices provided some
movement of the needle guide and needle relative to the
transducer, the physician was significantly hampered in
positioning the needle prior to and during insertion, as
well in positioning the transducer once the needle had
been inserted into the body.A commonly used device includes a transducer and a coaxial
needle guide for manual positioning and insertion of a
needle. While these devices allow rapid and convenient
guided biopsy, they have several significant drawbacks:-1) the transducer must be placed directly over the lesion
which requires its sterilization or its draping by sterile
covering. 2) The physician is forced to hold the
transducer in one hand while using the other for
