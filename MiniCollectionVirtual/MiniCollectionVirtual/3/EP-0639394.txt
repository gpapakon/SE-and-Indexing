<ABSTRACT>
Snowboard clamping device having two clamping-jaw assemblies which can be turned to the left or right, in which device the clamping jaw which can be offset and the clamping jaw which can be displaced are rotatable into the particular clamping position of the board, the clamping jaw (6) which can be offset in the longitudinal direction having a grooved clamping surface (7), and the clamping jaw (11) which can be displaced in the longitudinal direction likewise having a grooved clamping surface (12) and a counterbore (18), the permanently connected thread piece (8, 13) projecting through the holder (1) and being mounted in the hole (9) to the [sic] longitudinal slot (14) of the holder (1), also forming the axis of rotation.

Clamping means for a snowboard, having a retaining
frame (1) which can be fixed on a work base and

comprises a horizontal supporting surface, as seen in the
use position, on which the snowboard (19) can be clamped

on the broad side, by means of a clamping jaw (11),
which, in the clamped position of the snowboard, can be

displaced transversely with respect to the longitudinal
direction of the snowboard (19), against a stop (6)

located opposite said clamping jaw (11), the retaining
frame (1) being adjoined laterally by a vertical supporting

surface, as seen in the use position, with a clamping
screw (23) located opposite, by means of which the

snowboard (21) can be clamped on the narrow side, characterized
in that the distance between the displaceable

clamping jaw (11) and the stop (6) can be adjusted in a
stepwise manner by shifting the stop (6), and in that

both the displaceable clamping jaw (11) and the shiftable
stop (6) are mounted so as to be pivotable around an axis

normal to the broad side of the snowboard located in the
clamped position, and they can be fixed in the position

in which they clamp the snowboard (19), with the result
that the displaceable clamping jaw (11) and the shiftable

stop (6) are also secured against pivoting in their
clamping position.
Clamping means according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the displaceable clamping jaw (11) and the

shiftable stop (6) are provided with grooves (12, 7) on
their clamping surfaces in contact with the snowboard.
Clamping means according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the displaceable clamping jaw (11) 

is fixedly connected, on its side which is directed
towards the supporting surface, to a threaded piece (13),

which can be displaced or pivoted in a slot (14) in the
supporting surface and projects on the underside of the

frame part (1) which bears the supporting surface, and
said displaceable clamping jaw can be fixed against the

frame (1) by a threaded nut, in particular a wing nut
(15).
Clamping means according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the shiftable stop (6) is fixedly

connected, on its side which is directed towards the
supporting surface, to a threaded piece (8), which can be

fitted through one of a number of bores (9) running
through the supporting surface of the retaining frame (1)

and which projects on the underside of the frame part (1)
which bears the supporting surface, and said shiftable

stop can be fixed against the frame (1) by a threaded
nut, in particular a wing nut (10).
Clamping means according to one of the existing
claims, characterized in that the retaining frame (1) is

of rectangular design, one side of the rectangle forming
the supporting surface.
Clamping means according to Claim 5, characterized
in that, at its end which is opposite the fastening

location, the rectangular retaining frame (1) has a
horizontal bearing plate (5) by which the frame bears on

the work base.
Clamping means according to one of the existing
claims, characterized in that the displaceable clamping

jaw (11) is provided with a counterbored hole (18) for
guiding an adjusting screw (17).
