<ABSTRACT>
A lubricating mechanism for a motor driven scroll apparatus has the compression 
and drive mechanisms within a hermetically sealed housing (11). 

The drive mechanism 
comprises a drive shaft (31) having a pin member (31a) extending from 

an inner end thereof and 
a motor (32) for rotating the drive shaft. The pin member is operatively 

connected to an 
orbiting scroll (22) of the compression mechanism through a bushing (311). 

The drive shaft 
includes a first axial bore (31b) extending from an open end adjacent 

a fluid inlet port (113c) and 
terminating adjacent the inner end of the drive shaft. Radial bores (31c) 

are provided at the 
terminal end of the first axial bore. A second axial bore (31e) extends 

from the terminal end 
of the drive shaft. The longitudinal axis of the first axial bore (31b) 

is substantially aligned 
with the second axial bore (31e). The bushing (311) includes a passage 

(33) extending substantially 
straight therethrough and substantially aligned with the open end of the second axial 

bore (31e). In another embodiment, the bushing further includes a radial 
straight portion 

radially extending from a terminal end of the axial straight portion and is open at an 
outer peripheral surface of the bushing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hermetic motor driven scroll 
apparatus with lubricating mechanism according to the 
precharacterizing portion of claim 1. A hermetic motor driven scroll apparatus as defined in the 
precharacterizing portion of claim 1 is disclosed for example in 
EP-A-539 239. A corresponding apparatus is shown in Figure 4 of 
US Patent No. 5,247,738 to Yoshii. Figure 1 shows an overall 
construction of such a conventional hermetic motor driven scroll 
compressor. For purposes of explanation only, the left side of 
Figure 1 will be referred to as the forward end or front of the 
compressor and the right side of Figure 1 will be referred to as 
the rearward end or rear of the compressor. The hermetic type motor driven scroll compressor 100 
comprises a compressor housing 11, which houses a compression 
mechanism 20. Compression mechanism 20 is a scroll-type fluid 
compression mechanism. A drive mechanism 30 is also housed within 
housing 11. Housing 11 comprises cylindrical portion 111 and 
first and second cup-shaped portions 112 and 113. An open end of 
first cup-shaped portion 112 is releasably and hermetically 
connected to a front open end of cylindrical portion 111 by a 
plurality of bolts 12. An open end of second cup-shaped portion 
113 is releasably and  
 
hermetically connected to a rear open end of cylindrical portion 111 by a plurality of 
bolts 13. Scroll-type fluid compression mechanism 20 comprises fixed scroll 21 having 
circular end plate 21a and spiral element 21b, which rearwardly extends from circular 
end plate 21a. Circular end plate 21a of fixed scroll 21 is fixedly disposed within first 
cup-shaped portion 112 by a plurality of bolts 14. Compression mechanism 20 further 
comprises orbiting scroll 22 having circular end plate 22a and spiral element 22b, which 
forwardly extends from circular end plate 22a. Spiral element 21b of fixed scroll 21 
interfits with spiral element 22b of orbiting scroll 22 with an angular and radial offset. Seal element 211 is disposed at an end surface of spiral element 21b of fixed 
scroll 21, thereby sealing the mating surfaces of spiral element 21b of fixed scroll 21 and 
circular end plate 22a of orbiting scroll 22. Similarly, seal element 221 is disposed at 
an end surface of spiral element 22b of orbiting scroll 22, thereby sealing the mating 
surfaces of spiral element 22b of orbiting scroll 22 and circular end plate 21a of fixed 
scroll 21. O-ring seal element 40 is elastically disposed between an outer peripheral 
surface of
