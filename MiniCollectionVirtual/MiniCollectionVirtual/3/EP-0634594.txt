<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a bearing unit for devices involved in mechanical process technology, in which a combination of a stopping box in the form of a contactless gap seal through which a sealing medium flows axially with a radial sealing ring is used to seal off the working space from the bearing arrangement. By means of the shaft, which, when stationary, is displaceable axially counter to the force of a spring, and appropriate design of the working part and the bearing housing, pressure-tight sealing of the interior of the bearing housing with respect to the working space and the flow passages for the sealing medium is achieved. This makes it possible to introduce cleaning or sterilisation medium at high temperature and pressure into the stopping box and working space via the conduits for the sealing medium, without damaging the bearing arrangement.

Bearing unit for a mechanical process technology system where a rotating
processing element (10) acts mechanically upon a product within a

processing chamber,

with a bearing housing (03, 15) in which the rotor consisting mainly of
processing element (10), shaft (11) and drive element (20) is supported

to rotate in bearings (17) to permit the radial and axial forces which arise
during operation to be absorbed,
with a seal to seal the processing chamber to the outside effected by
means of a stuffing box in the form of a non-contact gap seal (06, 07)

located radially between the rotor and bearing housing (03, 15) and
rinsed axially by a sealing, cleaning or sterilising medium, whereby in the

approximate centre of its axial extent, an annular chamber (05) is
incorporated to permit supply of the medium,
and with the sealing elements (16) which contact the shaft (11) to seal
the inside of the bearing housing with the bearings (17) against the

medium on the one side and the atmosphere on the other side,

characterised in that

a) the surfaces bordering the stuffing box gap (06, 07) consist of the
peripheral surface of a bush which co-rotates with the processing

element (10) on the shaft (11) and two surfaces of the bearing housing
(03, 15) which in their axial span are uniformly spaced radially, and

between which the annular chamber (05) for the supply of the medium
(E1) into the bearing housing is incorporated.
b) at the end of the stuffing box gap (07) turned away from the annular
chamber (05), a second annular chamber (C) is incorporated into the

bearing housing (03, 15) which is in part bordered axially by the front
face (13) of the bush which co-rotates with the processing element (10),
c) the rotor, consisting of processing element (10), shaft (11), and drive
element (20), is designed along with the bearings (17) to slide against

the force of a spring (19) from the operating position axially in the
direction of the drive elements in the bearing housing (03, 15), whereby

the displacement range (Sp3) is dimensioned such that when the final
position is reached, the front face (13) of the bush lies flush against a

countersurface of the bearing housing so that the inside of the bearing
housing (03, 15) is hermetically sealed against the second annular

chamber (C).
Bearing unit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the widths of
the stuffing box gaps (06, 07) are different.
Bearing unit in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the width of
the stuffing box gap (06) which borders the processing chamber (A) is wider

than the other stuffing box gap (07). 
Bearing unit in accordance with one of the Claims 1 - 3, characterised in
that together with the front surface (13), the bush which co-rotates with the

processing element (10) simultaneously forms the hub of the processing
element (10).
Bearing unit in accordance with one of the Claims 1 - 4, characterised in
that the annular chambers (05, C) are equipped with connections (01, 09,

29, 32) to permit the supply and discharge of a sealing, cleaning or
sterilising medium by means of boreholes (02, 08, 30, 31) in the bearing

housing (03, 15) and that for each annular chamber, the mouths of the inlet
and outlet boreholes are diametrically opposed to each other.
Bearing unit in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that with a
horizontally arranged shaft (11), the inlet borehole (02) leads into the

highest point and the associated outlet borehole (08) leads out of the lowest
point of the annular chamber (05), and that the inlet borehole (30) leads

into the highest point and the associated outlet borehole (31) leads out of

the lowest point of the second annular chamber (C).
Bearing unit in accordance with Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the
section of the bearing housing (03, 15) which houses the annular chambers

(05, C) and boreholes (02, 08, 30, 31) is designed as a removable section
(03) and is fastened to the main housing (15) and to the machine housing

(27) by means of quick-action clamp closures (26).
Bearing unit in accordance with one of the Claims 1 - 6, characterised in
that a sealing ring (14) which is fitted into a circular groove in the bearing

housing (03, 15) and which slightly projects over the opposing surface of
the bearing housing (03, 15) in axial direction, serves as an additional

opposing surface for the front face (13) of the bush.
Bearing unit in accordance with one of the Claims 1 - 8, characterised in
that if anti-friction bearings are used as the bearings (17) for the rotor

consisting of processing element (10), shaft (11), and drive element (20),
the spring element (19) consists of several cup springs configured into a set

which engage with the outside race of the anti-friction bearing closest to the
drive elements and which are pretensioned by means of the bearing cover

(04) which seals the bearing housing (03, 15).
