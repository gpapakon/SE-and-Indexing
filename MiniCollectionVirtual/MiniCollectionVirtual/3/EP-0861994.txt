<ABSTRACT>
A preferably cast zinc housing (4) has a chamber (22) for
receiving a metal stranded cable (6) 1/16 inch in diameter

which is swaged at one end to the housing in the chamber (22).
The housing (4) has a conical bore (32) in communication with the

ambient about the housing via apertures at opposing ends of
the housing. A channel (36) having a depth of about one half the

cable diameter is in the bore surface aligned with the
apertures to form a continuous cable insertion path with

the apertures. A relatively weak coil spring (50) and a pair of
different diameter steel balls (52,54) are in the conical bore (32).

The cable free end is inserted into the path through the
housing with minimal insertion resistance from the balls (52,54)

and spring (50). Withdrawal of the cable wedges the balls (52,54)
uniformly against the cable (6) deforming it and locking the

cable (6) to the housing (4). The balls (52,54) each uniformly stress the
cable (6) to spread the stress of the wedging action. This

reduces stress concentration on the cable (6) at each ball (52,54) so
that the cable (6) fails only at its maximum tensile load.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to security seals, and more
particularly, to a seal and lock employing a cable and a
mechanism for securing a free end of the cable to the seal
by wedging action within a tapered housing bore employing
balls.Of interest is commonly owned US Pat. No. 5,222,776
which discloses a
security seal and lock of which the present invention is an
improvement. In this patent a robust housing has a path for
receiving a cable free end to be secured to the housing,
the other cable end being secured to the housing. A tapered
cavity is in the housing through which the path passes. The
path is defined by cable entrance and exit holes in the
housing and the cavity. A pair of balls are in the cavity
and are biased by a spring toward the entrance hole and the
small transverse dimension of the cavity.The path is such that it is intercepted by the balls
which are used for locking the cable to the housing to
preclude withdrawal of the cable. The entrance hole is
offset from the exit hole transversely to the general cable
insertion direction. The balls and the offset holes provide
a path for the cable during insertion which path is
inclined relative to the general insertion direction. In
practice, insertion of the cable along the path through the
housing is required to lock the cable free end to the
housing. Withdrawal of the inserted free end is precluded
by the balls jamming against the inserted cable. A problem
is present in that, while the disclosed seal works well,
it is relatively difficult at times to insert the cable 
through the housing along the path. The lock device is used
with a stranded cable which has a given tensile load
capability. A further problem is that when employed in the
lock device, the cable tends to fail at tensile loads
significantly less than that of the cable maximum tensile
load. This is undesirable.The present inventors recognize a need for a seal and
lock of the type described and disclosed in the
aforementioned patent to have reduced insertion force for
the cable. The present inventors also recognize that the
path of the cable is intercepted by the balls and this
contributes to the increased insertion force. They further
recognize that in this type of security seal the spring
always urges the balls toward the chamber smaller diameter.
Thus the cable must always engage the balls during
insertion. This engagement requires the cable during
insertion to displace the balls against the spring creating
the underised insertion load. The present inventors also
recognize a need for
