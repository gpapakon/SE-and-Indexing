<ABSTRACT>
In a packet communications network, the addition or deletion of a
connection to the network by a user is governed by a link traffic metric

which represents the effective capacity of each link in the network which
participates in the packet connection route. A new connection (or deletion)

is represented by a compatible metric which allows updates in the link
metric by simple vector addition or subtraction. Separate link metrics for a

plurality of classes of service permit a much higher efficiency in the exploitation
of the link bandwidth than is possible with a single link metric. A

packet network using multiple link metrics and efficient metric updating
techniques provides increased packet throughput while, at the same time,

preserving all class of service guarantees.
