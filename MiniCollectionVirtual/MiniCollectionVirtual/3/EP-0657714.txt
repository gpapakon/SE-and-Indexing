<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure the profile of the edge of a strip coil, an optical beam is directed towards the edge of the coil and a relative movement is created between the coil and the optical beam, in order for the latter to scan the edge of the coil along at least one predetermined direction. The distance between a plurality of points on the edge, which are distributed along this direction, and a predetermined reference position chosen along the beam is measured. The predetermined direction is preferably a diameter of the edge of the coil. The optical beam is advantageously parallel to the axis of the coil, and at least two distance measurements are carried out on the edge of each turn of the coil. The detector is preferably installed under the conveyor for transporting the coils, and in the axis of the latter, so as to scan the edge along a diameter.

Method for measuring the profile of the side of
a coil of strip, in which an incident optical beam is

directed at the side of the said coil, relative motion
between the coil and the said optical beam is created

so that the said incident optical beam scans the said
side of the coil over a diameter, and the distance

between a plurality of points on the said side, which
are distributed along the said diameter, and a

predetermined reference position chosen along the said
beam is measured, characterized in that the optical

axis of the incident beam and the optical axis of the
reflected beam constitute a triangulation, and in that

the plane of this triangulation is perpendicular to the
scanning direction.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that an incident optical beam parallel to the axis of

the coil is directed at the side of the said coil.
Method according to one or other of Claims 1
and 2, characterized in that at least two distance

measurements are taken on the side of each turn in the
said coil.
Method according to one or other of Claims 1 to

operations:

a) the profile of the side of the coil is recorded
over the full diameter of the latter; 
b) the position of each measurement point along the
said diameter, relative to a predetermined origin,

is recorded;
c) on the basis of the pair of measurements obtained
at each point, namely the position p of the point

and the height h of the profile at this point, the
average slope of the curve of the profile is

calculated along the scanning diameter:
d) the measured profile is corrected by means of the
