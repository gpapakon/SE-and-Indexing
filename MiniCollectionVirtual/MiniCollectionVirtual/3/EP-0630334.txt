<ABSTRACT>
Device for tilting, carrying and transporting a grand piano (2). This device comprises a wheeled frame (3, 4) designed to run underneath the grand piano. Elements for gripping (5), lifting (14) and tilting (17) the grand piano are fitted on the frame. The gripping elements (5) are made U-shaped to grip at least the bottom face (6), an adjacent end (7) face and the top face (8) of the grand piano. The gripping elements (5) are provided with wheels (11) and are detachably connected to the lifting and tilting devices. After lifting and then turning the piano through 90 DEG  and removing the legs and the like, the piano can be moved independently with the gripping elements by detaching the lifting and tilting devices. The gripping elements can form part of a case for protecting against damage during further transportation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device according
to the preamble of Claim 1.Such a device is known from US-A-4,913,614. In
this case the wheeled frame is moved under the grand
piano. The L-shaped gripping elements are placed under
the bottom face of the grand piano and the adjacent end
face. By means of two lifting and tilting devices fitted
laterally at the ends of the frame, the grand piano is
first raised and then tilted to almost 90Â°. In this
tilted position an auxiliary vehicle is manoeuvred
against the frame, so that the grand piano can be transferred
from the gripping elements to the auxiliary
vehicle. Apart from the fact that this is a very complex
construction, it is not ensured that the grand piano will
be moved without damage, or it is necessary to carry out
the fixing of the grand piano a number of times. During
the transfer of the grand piano from the gripping
elements to the auxiliary vehicle there is a great risk
of damage from an uncontrolled tilting movement of the
grand piano, which weights up to 500 kg. This can be
avoided by first fastening the grand piano to the gripping
elements with the aid of holding straps or the like,
and then fastening the grand piano to the auxiliary
vehicle with the aid of holding straps, and removing the
holding straps from the gripping elements. It is clear
that this is very laborious. Besides, there is in each
case the problem that the end face of the grand piano is
not protected. This problem could be eliminated by
extending the gripping elements, but it is not possible
to protect the top face of the grand piano adjacent
thereto, so that damage could occur relatively simply to
this part on the underside during transportation.The object of the present invention is to provide
a device which does not have the above-mentioned disadvantages,
i.e. is cheap to produce and simple to handle, 
and with it damage is guaranteed to be prevented.This object is achieved with a device of the type
described above through the characterising measures of
Claim 1.The invention is based on the idea of connecting
the gripping elements in a detachable manner to the
lifting and tilting devices. The result is that the step
of transferring the gripping elements to the auxiliary
vehicle, as known from US Patent Specification 4,913,614,
is unnecessary. Such a design can be achieved only by
fitting detaching devices and wheels on the gripping
elements. Through this idea it is also possible to
produce the gripping elements in such an optimum manner
that the grand piano is

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for tilting, carrying and transporting
a grand piano (2), comprising a frame (3) provided with

wheels (4), on which elements are fitted for gripping,
lifting and tilting the grand piano, while the gripping

elements (5) act on at least the bottom face (6) and an
adjacent end face (7) of the grand piano, 
characterised
in that
 the gripping elements (5) are made U-shaped, in
order also to grip a part of the top side of the grand

piano (8), in that the gripping elements (5) are
detachably connected to the lifting and tilting devices

and the body (10) of the U-shape is provided with
wheels (11).
Device according to Claim 1, in which the gripping
elements are provided with the fastenings (12) for

placing in a container (13).
Device according to Claim 2, in which the gripping
elements form part of the external boundary of the

container (13).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
in which the means for lifting and tilting comprise a

single lifting and tilting element (9) fitted in the
centre of the frame.
Device according to Claim 4, in which the lifting/tilting
element comprises a parallelogram arm construction

which is hingedly fixed at one end to the frame
(1), while lifting elements (14) are fitted between the

frame and the construction, and which arm is hingedly
fixed at the other end to a plate (15) to which a coupling

part (16) is hingedly fixed, while tilting devices
(17) engage on the coupling part at one side and on the

plate or the parallelogram arm construction at the other
side.
