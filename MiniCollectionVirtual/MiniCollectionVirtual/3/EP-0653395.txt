<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramics sintered 
body and a surface working method therefor. Fine ceramics, having characteristics of high 
hardness and high strength, is now being applied to a wear 
resistant part, a sliding part or the like. Roughness and 
fine cracks exist in a surface of ceramics after 
sintering, i.e., a sintered surface. When these defects 
are left intact, the ceramics sintered body is broken from 
these defects serving as starting points, and exhibits 
extremely brittle behavior. In order to apply a ceramics 
sintered body to an actual mechanical part or the like, 
therefore, it is necessary to remove potential defects 
which are contained in a surface layer of the ceramics 
sintered body, thereby improving surface strength. In general, grinding with a diamond grindstone or the 
like is employed as a method of removing a surface layer 
of a ceramics sintered body. When the surface layer of 
the ceramics sintered body is removed by grinding, 
however, an alteration layer may be formed, chipping and 
scratches may be introduced, and residual stress may be 
introduced in the surface layer after working. These  
 
defects serve as factors deteriorating surface strength of 
the ceramics sintered body. With respect to a hard and 
fragile ceramics sintered body, grinding is so difficult 
that the degrees of freedom in the working shape and the 
conditions for performing working are extremely lowered. 
In particular, fine working is difficult with respect to a 
ceramics sintered body. In such fine working, damage of 
working portions is easily caused by chipping or the like 
in particular, and reduction of reliability with respect 
to the part life such as resulting damage caused during 
employment comes into question. It is possible to recover damage portions or 
defective parts existing in the surface of the ceramics 
sintered body after working. However, macro defects 
influencing on reliability of the member are not 
sufficiently recovered although defects are recovered at 
fine levels, and hence this means is insufficient for 
obtaining a member sufficiently effectuating excellent 
strength and characteristics originally provided in the 
ceramics. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
surface working method for a ceramics sintered body which 
can suppress occurrence of surface damage portions to the 
minimum. Another object of the present invention is to provide  
 
a ceramics sintered body having high reliability as a 
mechanical part in practice, with small
