<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a plurality of apparatus and processes for forming a hexagonal-cell honeycomb core, and to the honeycomb core made thereby. One apparatus (20) and process forms a honeycomb half-cell structure from a web of material. Another apparatus (24) and process applies at least one adhesive component to the honeycomb half-cell structure. An apparatus (26) and process cuts the honeycomb half-cell structure into a plurality of sheets. A further apparatus (29) and process stacks the half-cell structure to make a hexagonal-cell honeycomb core. In addition, the present invention is directed to a system and a method which advance the leading edge of a supply of web and which position the web for a secondary operation, and to a transfer head for holding at least one sheet of half-cell structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a
process for forming a hexagonal-cell honeycomb core. Devices for stacking a corrugated medium to form a
hexagonal-cell honeycomb core are
known in the prior art. However, a problem associated with 
such known stacking devices is that they have configurations
which are complicated, time-consuming and thus expensive.US-A-3 493 450 describes a process for making a flat,
later to be expanded honeycomb core by applying adhesive
in strips to flat material and cutting the strip material
into sheets, stacking the sheets and holding them
until a desired number of sheets are stacked. After
stacking, the entire stack of laminated sheets is covered
with a vacuum bag and vacuum pressure is kept on
the stack via an exhaust line during the cure cycle of
the adhesive. Continuous stacking of the sheets while
simultaneously pressing the sheets together is not possible. The present invention solves the problems of the
prior art associated with stacking a corrugated medium by
providing an apparatus and a process for stacking sheets of
half-cell structure which accurately align the sheets
without waste as they are stacked to form a honeycomb core,
and that produce a honeycomb core which is accurate and
inexpensive to manufacture. In order to achieve the foregoing
solution, there is provided on apparatus for stacking a
half-cell structure to make a hexagonal-cell honeycomb core.
The structure has a plurality of peaks, a plurality of
valleys and a diagonal surface between each consecutive peak
and valley. The apparatus comprises an enclosure
for stacking the layers so that as one layer is placed on
the top of a stack comprising at least one layer, the peaks
of one layer contact the peaks of an adjacent layer. The
apparatus also comprises a differential pressure mechanism
disposed beneath the top of the stack for reducing the air
pressure surrounding the stack to a pressure below the air
pressure on the top of the stack, thereby pressing the
sheets together to form the core. The accompanying drawings
illustrate
embodiments of the invention and together with the
description, serve to explain the principles of the
invention.Fig. 1 is an overall, perspective view of a system
for forming a honeycomb half-cell structure from a supply of
material and for producing a honeycomb core from the half-cell
structure.Fig. 2 is an exploded view of a corner section of
the assembled honeycomb core.Fig. 3 is a schematic view of a portion of a half-cell
forming apparatus.Fig. 4 is an enlarged,

An apparatus for stacking sheets (39) of a half-cell
structure (25) to form a hexagonal-cell honeycomb

core (30), the half-cell structure (25) having a
plurality of peaks (42,42') and valleys (44,44') and

a diagonal surface (46) between each consecutive
peak (42,42') and valley (44,44') the, apparatus

characterized by

(a) an enclosure (34) for stacking the sheets (39)
so that as one sheet (39) is placed on the top

of a stack comprising at least one sheet (41),
the peaks (42') of one sheet (41) contact the

peaks (42'') of an adjacent sheet (39), wherein
the enclosure (34) surrounds the stacked

sheets (39,41) for restricting the flow of air
around the periphery thereof while permitting

placement of sheets (39) on top of the stack,
and
(b) a duct (188) in fluid communication with the
enclosure (34) and with a differential pressure

means (190a) for reducing the air pressure
surrounding the stack to a pressure below

the air pressure on the top of the stack during
placement of sheets (39) on top of the

stack, thereby pressing the stacked sheets
(39,41) together to form the core (30).
A process of making a hexagonal-cell honeycomb core

plurality of peaks (42,42') and valleys (44,44') and

the peaks (42') of one sheet (41) contact the

peaks (42'') of an adjacent sheet (39), and
(b) applying a differential pressure force to the

air pressure surrounding the stack to a pressure
below the air pressure on the top of the

stack during placement of sheets (39) on top
of the stack to press the sheets (39,41) together

thereby forming the core (30).
