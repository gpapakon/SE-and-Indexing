<DESCRIPTION>
 ADHESIVE AGENT CONTAININGPOLYSILOXANE-GRAFTED POLYMER, ANDCOSMETIC COMPOSITIONS THEREOFTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to adhesive agents containing polysiloxane-grafted polymers and to compositions, such as cosme¬ tic compositions, containing such adhesive agents. This invention especially relates to adhesive agents useful for hair setting purposes, and to hair setting compositions containing such adhe¬ sive agents.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The desire to have hair retain a particular shape is widely held. Such style retention is generally accomplished by either of two routes: permanent chemical alteration or temporary alteration of hair style/shape. A temporary alteration is one which can be removed by water or by shampooing. Temporary style alteration has generally been accomplished by means of the application of a composition to dampened hair after shampooing and/or conditioning and prior to drying and/or styling. The materials used to provide setting benefits have generally been resins or gums and have been applied in the form of mousses, gels, lotions, or sprays. This approach presents several significant drawbacks to the user. It requires a separate step following shampooing/conditioning to apply the styling composition. In addition, since the style hold is provided by resin materials which set-up on the hair, the hair tends to feel sticky or stiff after application and it is diffi¬ cult to restyle the hair without further application of the styling composition.It has recently been discovered that hair care compositions containing polysiloxane-grafted polymers can provide excellent hair style retention benefits, together with hair conditioning. The compositions may be in any of the conventional forms includ- ing, but not limited to, shampoos, conditioners, hair sprays, 

tonics, lotions, gels, and mousses. The compositions can provide these benefits to hair without leaving the hair stiff or sticky/tacky feel, as do conventional hair setting ingredients. These types of adhesive, film-forming, polysiloxane-grafted polymers can also be used for other purposes, such as topical application to skin for cosmetic purposes or as a means for delivery of medicaments^ The film forming agents can also be used in a wide variety of other adhesive areas, e.g. adhesive paper or binding materials, etc. Polysiloxane-grafted polymers are disclosed for use in EPO Application 90307528.1, published January 16, 1991 as EPO Publication 0 408311 A2, Hayama, et al., U.S. Patent 5,061,481, issued October 29,
