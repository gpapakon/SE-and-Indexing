<ABSTRACT>
Color-containing alkanolamines or alkyleneamines, 
having color numbers of up to 100 PtCo or higher, can 

be treated with inorganic solid acidic catalysts. 
Inorganic support materials having bonded inorganic 

acid functionalities may be used as the inorganic 
solid acidic catalysts. In the presence of water, 

these inorganic solid acidic catalysts produce 
decolorized alkanolamines or alkyleneamines having 

color numbers of 20 PtCo or less. The process of 
decolorization can be carried out in batch or 

continuous mode processes thus providing low cost, 
high quality and high purity end products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for decolorizing
alkanolamines, and more particularly, to both
batch and continuous processes for producing alkanolamines
having improved color characteristics by treatment
with solid acidic catalyst.Price and purity are important characteristics of a chemical's
marketability to a potential customer. During industrial processes
used to produce various chemicals, impurities often enter the
processes and manifest themselves in the form of color
contamination. The sources of this color contamination may be
metals and metal compounds from the catalysts or equipment used
in the processes, or conjugated organic compounds which are
formed during the processes. Since the mechanism by which these
color contaminants are formed varies from process to process, the
decolorization process normally acts by a mechanism which depends
on the color source. Alkanolamines may, for example, be conventionally prepared
by reacting an alkylene oxide with ammonia or an amine, or, more
particularly, alkanolamines such as aminoethylethanolamine may
typically be prepared by the reductive amination of
monoethanolamine. Alkanolamines produced by these conventional processes can
vary in color from nearly colorless water-white liquids to pale yellow.
Alkanolamines, particularly ethanolamines, are susceptible to color
formation in the presence of oxygen (e.g. from air leaks during
manufacture and/or storage), excessive temperature and soluble
metals such as iron or nickel. Also, impurities in raw materials
may contribute to the initial and continuing formation of color bodies.Various attempts to overcome the problems associated with
color and color instability of alkanolamines have proven to be cost
intensive and environmentally unacceptable. Such attempts have
included purification by fractional distillation, concentration of color
forming bodies or their precursors by fractional distillation, carbon
treatment, the use of adsorbent materials, various hydrogenation
techniques, and the use of reducing agents such as sodium
borohydride and hydrazine.US-A- 2744938 describes a process for the treatment
of color-sensitive organic compounds which have become discolored
through oxidation or upon aging. The patent specifically describes
the method of removal of color bodies from alkylphenols with a
catalyst-free solid adsorbent in the presence of hydrogen maintained
at super atmospheric pressure. The thus treated alkylphenol is then
separated from the solid adsorbent material.US-A- 3207790 describes a
