<ABSTRACT>
Polymers consist of (a) 1-50 % weight of one or several unsaturated, polymerisable carboxylic acids having the formula (I), in which R1 stands for hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or COOM, R2 stands for hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl, R3 stands for hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or CH2COOM and M stands for hydrogen, ammonium, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal; and (c) 0-40 % by weight water soluble monomers copolymerisable with (a) and (b). These polymers preferably contain acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and maleic acid as unsaturated polymerisable carboxylic acids. Also disclosed are the use of these polymers as complexing agents, as peroxide stabilizers and builders in washing products, as dispersing agents and hardness stabilizers.
