<ABSTRACT>
Device for analysing information supports comprising an image detector (1) including, in a casing, a series of light sources with each one of which is associated a photosensitive element (16), the light sources and photosensitive elements (16) being arranged in two rows lengthwise along the image detector, the device furthermore comprising a threshold voltage source (6) and means (5) for comparing the output signals from each of the photosensitive elements (16) with the threshold voltage (Vs) of the said source, characterised in that it moreover includes compensation means (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25) for varying at least one of the parameters comprising the output voltage of each photosensitive element (16), the threshold voltage (Vs) and the strength of the light signal emitted by the associated source (10) in order to obtain a uniform response of all the photosensitive elements of the reading device.

Device for analysing data carriers comprising an image sensor (1) having
in a housing (9) a series of light sources (10) for illuminating the data carrier to

be analysed, a light-sensitive element (16) being associated with each of the light
sources; wherein the light sources (10) and the light-sensitive elements (16) are

disposed in two rows along the length of the image sensor, the device also
comprising a threshold voltage source (6) and means (5) for comparing the

output signals of each of the light-sensitive elements (16) with the threshold
voltage (Vs) of the said source, the device also having compensating means (20.

output voltage of each light-sensitive element (16), the threshold voltage (Vs)

and the intensity of the light signal emitted by the source associated (10) in order
to obtain a uniform response of all the light-sensitive elements of the read-out

device, the said compensating means comprising at least one memory (21) for
storing values for correcting at least one of the said parameters relative to each

pair consisting of light source (10) and light-sensitive element (11) and means
(20) for modifying the said at least one parameter as a function of the

corresponding correction values contained in the said memory (21), and the said
means for modifying parameters comprise a multiplier digital/analogue converter

(20) connected to the output of each light-sensitive element (16) and/or to the
output of the source (6) of threshold voltage (Vs) and/or to the output of a circuit

(8) for controlling the luminous intensity of each of the light sources (10).
Device for analysing data carriers as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in
that the digital/analogue converter (20) is of the linear or non-linear type. 
Device for analysing data carriers as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in
that the non-linear multiplier digital/analogue converter comprises an input

resistance (R) connected between the input and the output of the converter and
resistances (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6) connected in parallel to the output of the

converter with the interposition of a controlled switch (D0, D1, D2, D3. D4. D5)
in series with each of the resistances in parallel, the control terminal of each

switch being connected to a corresponding data output of the memory (21).
Device for analysing data carriers as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in
that the values of resistances in parallel of the digital/analogue converter (20) are

linked to the value of the input resistance (R1) by the relationships:

R1 = R/2

Device for analysing data carriers as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4.
characterised in that it also includes a counter (22) controlled by a clock (23) in

order to ensure the addressing of the memory (21) with a view to the application
by the latter of the correction data corresponding the successive pairs consisting
