<ABSTRACT>
To realize compactness of an inductance element 
such as choke coil or the like, an inductance element is 

provided which is composed of a magnetic core having a 
central hollow portion defined by a magnetic alloy thin 

strip, and a lead line disposed to pass through the 
hollow portion of the magnetic core. A specific magnetic 

permeation µ of said magnetic core is in the range of 
100 to 10,000.

<DESCRIPTION>
In, for example, a switching power supply for
controlling a large amount of current in a high
frequency range, a choke coil has been conventionally
used to converting an AC current to a DC current or to
interrupt a high frequency component from a DC current
or an AC current of a low frequency.On the other hand, the field to which a switching
power supply may be applied has been expanded due to a
tendency that bodies of electronic equipment are small
in size and thinner and thinner. In order to meet this
requirement and to make thin the switching power supply
itself, choke coils or the like which are components of
the switching power supply have to be made small in size
and thin.For instance, in order to reduce a height of an
article to half an inch, a part or component, to
constitute it, that has a height (or length) of 10 mm or
less is required in view of a clearance. In other words,
magnetic parts of this type such as transformers, choke
coils and the like have not yet been made satisfactorily
low in height, and in particular, in a field where an
electric power of 10 W or more is used, there have not
been such compact components.Furthermore, for the purpose of enhancing a heat 
radiation efficiency of the circuit, there is a demand
to thin the overall physical size of the circuit.Under such a circumstance, a thin type magnetic
component such as a thin type choke coil has been
realized utilizing a feature that ferrite magnetic
powder may be molded or formed into a desired shape.However, since a saturated magnetic flux density of
the ferrite magnetic material is low in comparison with
that of a metallic magnetic material, the satisfactory
compactness has not always been attained by the ferrite
magnetic material in comparison with the choke coils
which are made of different magnetic material,
respectively, with the same performance.In view of this point or the like, a public
attention has been paid to a technique to obtain a
compact choke coil in which a thin strip made of
amorphous magnetic alloy or crystallite magnetic alloy
having a much higher saturated magnetic flux density
than that of the ferrite magnetic material is used.For producing such an element, a magnetic alloy
thin strip having a predetermined strip width is wound
to obtain a toroidal shaped magnetic core having a
hollow central portion with a predetermined inside
diameter, and is subjected to a suitable heat treatment.
Then, the core is received in a resin case or coated
with a resin coating. Then, a winding is effected to its
thin strip
