Organopolysiloxane polyethers of the general
formula



where

R
1
is a divalent, branched or unbranched alkylene
radical having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms in the

alkylene chain,
R
2
is a radical of the formula (C

O-)
s
R
3
, where m is
from 
>
2.0 to â‰¤2.5, s is from 4 to 21 and R
3
 is a
hydrogen atom, an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4

carbon atoms or an acetyl radical, but if the radical
R

with the proviso that at least 50 mol% of the oxyalkylene
groups are oxyethylene groups.
