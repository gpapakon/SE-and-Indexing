<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds, to a process for preparing such 
compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to the 
use of such compounds and compositions in medicine and agriculture. European patent application, publication number 0455006 discloses certain 
arylethanolamine derivatives which are stated to possess anti-diabetic and/or anti-hyperglycaemic 
and/or anti-obesity activity. It has been discovered that a series of novel phosphonated arylethanolamine 
derivatives have good β-adrenoreceptor agonist activity and in particular show good 
selectivity for β3-adrenoreceptors versus β1- or β2-adrenoreceptors. These 
compounds are therefore indicated to have good anti-hyperglycaemic and/or anti-obesity 
activity coupled with especially good selectivity from cardiac and 
tremorigenic side effects. They are also indicated to have potential in the treatment of gastrointestinal 
diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. These compounds also have potential as growth promoters for livestock and 
for decreasing birth mortality rate and increasing the post-natal survival rate in 
livestock. These compounds may also be of use in increasing the high-density-lipoprotein 
(HDL) cholesterol concentration and decreasing the triglyceride 
concentration in human blood serum and are therefore of potential use in the 
treatment and/or prophylaxis of atherosclerosis. They are also indicated to be useful 
for the treatment of hyperinsulinaemia. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula (I): 
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or amide thereof thereof, or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, 
wherein, 
Ro represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group; R1 represents hydrogen or an alkyl group;  
 R2 represents a moiety of formula (a): 
 
wherein R4 and R5 each independently represent hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, 
cycloalkyl or R4 together with R5 represents (CH2)n wherein n is 2, 3 or 4; 
T represents hydrogen, nitrile or a group -CO.RS wherein RS represents hydroxy, 
alkoxy or a group -NRtRu wherein Rt and Ru independently represent hydrogen, 
alkyl or Rt and Ru together with the nitrogen to which they are attached represent a 
saturated heterocyclic group; and R3 represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl or alkoxy. Suitably, Ro represents a phenyl group optionally substituted with halogen or 
a hydroxy, examples include chlorophenyl, especially 3-chlorophenyl, and 
hydroxyphenyl, especially 3,4-bis-hydroxyphenyl. Suitably, R1 is an
