<ABSTRACT>
An illuminated multi-position rotary selector/control switch 
assembly (10) for 

switching substantial direct current (20 amps) at low voltages (12 V). A lower 
plastic housing shell (14) is molded in a two-stage process with the 

first stage 
comprising molding platable thermoplastic resin strips (58,60,62) 

and molding thereover 
second stage unplatable thermoplastic with exposed surface portions of said 

first first stage subsequently plated to form conductive strips having stationary 
switching contacts attached. The connector terminal pins (44,46,48,50) 

are formed integrally 
with the strips in the first stage molding. The second stage thermoplastic 

molded thereover forms the part outline. The upper housing shell (12) 
has a 

transparent arcuate window (36) molded integrally therein for 
collecting and feeding 

light from a lamp to a light pipe (122) carried by the user 
rotatable actuation knob (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to switches having a knob rotatable by the 
user for switching between a plurality of desired control positions for controlling 
the operation of an electrically operated appliance. The invention relates 
particularly to rotary switches of the type intended for switching loads such as 
motors operating on relatively low voltage direct current supplies as, for 
example, a 12-volt supply typically encountered on board automobiles. In automotive selector or control switch applications, it has been desired 
to provide a user control knob actuator which is readily and easily rotatable 
between a plurality of control positions, and to provide for detented action in 
each of the desired control positions, and also to provide for illumination of 
indicia indicating the state of switch actuation and the control function selected 
at each position to facilitate nighttime operation. Furthermore, it is often required to switch substantial current as, for 
example, 20 amps motor load at 12-volt DC, which is typical of starting 
currents in an automobile passenger compartment climate control blower motor. 
Thus it has been desired to provide an illuminated reliable low cost rotary 
selector switch for relatively high current, low voltage applications such as 
those encountered in automobiles, and to provide such a switch which is 
capable of high volume mass production, which is reliable in service, and which 
is low in manufacturing cost. The present invention provides a multi-position rotary selector switch for 
user switching between a plurality of control positions for selecting the desired 
function of an appliance to be controlled. The switch assembly includes an 
upper and lower housing shell formed of insulating material with a plastic shaft 
journalled for rotation in the upper shell and extending outwardly thereof with a 
control knob received thereon.  The lower housing shell is formed in two stages of thermoplastic 
molding, a first stage of platable plastic strips in an array interconnected by 
molding runners. The first stage is removed from a first stage mold and 
inserted in a second stage mold and followed by a second stage injection of 
unplatable plastic which forms the part outline, leaving surface portions of the 
first stage strip exposed. After the second stage molding and removal from the 
mold, the exposed surface portions of the first stage material are plated to form 
discrete conductive strips which extend into a receptacle portion of the shell 
forming
