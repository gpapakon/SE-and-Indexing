Start-up procedure for a controlled-operation 
and/or automatic-operation sliding door, in particular 

a lift door, for start-up after assembly or after a 
repair with a change in operating data, and for later 

operation, wherein the door has a drive motor with 
digital pulse generator as well as a programmable 

electronic control unit, characterised in that the 
electronic control unit itself determines the door 

parameters from an indeterminate opening position by 
means of a pre-selected test routine, and delivers them 

to a non-volatile memory, for example a serial EE-PROM, 
as parameters for door control and possibly for 

automatic door control. 
Procedure according to claim 1, characterised 
in that, for start-up, the door is brought into a pre-determined 

region of opening, preferably into a wide 
opening position, is switched on in that position and 

then carries out a closing direction identification 
run. 
Procedure according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the closing direction 

identification is carried out by means of automatic 
test runs at an amplitude that increases in a preselected 

manner. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the closing direction 

identification begins with a movement of the door over 
a short pre-selected distance, for example 10 cm, in 

that, after the pre-selected distance has been covered 
without reaching the limit position of opening, 

automatic movement reversal takes place, and in that 
the door movement is then increased, repeatedly if 

necessary, for example it is doubled, until the opening 
position is reached and stored. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4,  
 

characterised in that, following the closing direction 
identification, the door carries out a door size 

identification run, wherein, from the opening position, 
the closing position of the door is determined by means 

of a door closing procedure at a slow speed and is 
stored in the non-volatile memory. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterised in that, by means of a further test run, 

the kinetic energy of the door, in particular during 
the closing movement, is determined from the motor 

current and from the door speed variation attained, by 
way of the door mass, and is limited, if necessary. 
Operating device according to one or more of 
the preceding claims for carrying out the start-up and 

operating procedure for a sliding door, in particular a 
lift door, having a drive motor with digital pulse 

generator and a programmable electronic control unit 
with non-volatile memory, wherein the non-volatile 

memory, for example an EE-PROM, is set up for self-parameterisation 
with the door parameters, 

characterised in that the door parameters determined by 
means of a test routine, which begins with a closing 

direction identification, are stored in the said non-volatile 
memory. 
Operating device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that it has a processor for 

determining geometric and dynamic door parameters such 
as opening width, kinetic energy etc., which processor, 

according to requirement selections, automatically 
follows a track curve, in particular a track curve with 

automatic speed control. 
Operating device for a sliding door, in 
particular a lift door, characterised in that it has a 

processor which is used for automatically determining 
door parameters by means of test routines such as, for 

example, opening direction - closing direction, opening  
 

and closing position, door weight etc. 
Operating device according to claim 9, 
characterised in that it has a processor which, using 

the door parameters determined by means of test 
routines, opens and closes the door in a controlled 

manner and/or in an automatically controlled manner, in 
particular with automatic speed control.
