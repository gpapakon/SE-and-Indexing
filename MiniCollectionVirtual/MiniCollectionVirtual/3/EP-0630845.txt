<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for distributing wound yarn (12) 
on a bobbin (1) by means of the yarn guide (29) and a drive 

roller (9) in a collection station, in such a manner as to 
prevent ribbing during the continuous superposing of the 

various layers of winding, hence rendering the subsequent 
technical operations to be undergone by the bobbin yarn (12) 

both possible and simple. The invention also provides an 
apparatus for implementing the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
distributing wound yarn on a bobbin under formation by 
means of a yarn guide and a drive roller in a collection 
station for textile yarns, bobbin and roller having shape 
different each other. In other words, this invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for distributing wound yarn on a conical bobbin 
driven by a cylindrical roller, or for distributing wound 
yarn on a cylindrical bobbin driven by a cone. More specifically, said apparatus comprises a control unit 
based on a mini-computer into which the operative winding 
data are fed for processing and comparing with the data 
arriving from transducer probes or similar means, to 
provide at the mini-computer output a number of command 
signals for activating and controlling the motive source 
which angularly positions the bobbin carrier arm so that 
the collection station operates in regions not subject to 
the ribbing effect. In the ensuing description and claims, the term "yarn" or 
"filament" indicates any type of filiform material, and the 
term "bobbin" indicates any package formed from yarn wound 
in substantially helical turns. In the state of the art a winding operation is used to form 
the yarn into a package suitable for subsequent processing.  Winding by dragging is known, in which the bobbin is driven 
by friction by a roller driven by the drive shaft while a 
yarn guide moves the yarn reciprocatingly. According to the above alternative cases, this roller can 
be a cylindrical roller and then the produced bobbin is 
conical, or this roller can be a conical or frusto-conical 
element and then the produced bobbin is cylindrical. In such a collection unit the yarn is compelled to follow 
the movements of the bobbin and yarn guide, so that the 
rotation of the drive roller produces a corresponding 
rectilinear translation movement by virtue of the yarn 
guide, which undergoes continuous to-and-fro movement. 
With reference to this field of the art, the problems 
strictly related to the principle of distribution of the 
yarn on the forming bobbin are of considerable importance. 
The winding units or stations arranged to produce bobbins 
of wound yarn almost always form deposits of turns 
concentrated at certain points to form ribbing. This yarn 
distribution defect arises during the bobbin winding when a 
wound turn is superposed on and parallel to the previous 
turns. This phenomenon occurs if the bobbin circumference is equal 
to the length of the winding turn, or to a multiple or a

<CLAIMS>
A method for distributing wound yarn on a forming 
bobbin driven by a drive roller in a collection station of 

a winding machine, in which bobbin and roller have a 
different shape each other, and respectively cylindrical or 

conical, in which in said collection station the drive 
roller rotates at constant rotational speed and the bobbin, 

which rests under pressure on the drive roller, is 
subjected to rotation which aided by the presence of a yarn 

guide element driven with periodic reciprocating 
rectilinear movement results in cross-winding of the yarn 

by unwinding it from the underlying feed package, 
chacterised in that the driving contact line between bobbin 

and roller is axially shifted, towards the major or the 
minor diameter of the conical element of the above bobbin-roller 

coupling, by the variation of inclination of the 
bobbin with respect to the drive roller in order to avoid 

the ribbing effect on the bobbin. 
A winding method for distributing wound yarn as claimed 
in claim 1 on a forming conical bobbin driven by a 

cylindrical drive roller in a collection station of a 
winding machine, for example an automatic winder, in which 

in said collection station the cylindrical roller rotates 
at constant rotational speed and the bobbin, which rests 

under pressure on the cylindrical drive roller, is provided 
with the necessary rotation to cross the yarn by unwinding 

it from the underlying feed package, said method being 
characterised by: 
determining moment by moment the deposition distance 
between two yarn turns successively deposited on the 

surface of the conical bobbin under formation; 
on the basis of previously recorded successive variations 
in distance between two consecutive turns, determining when 

said distance falls below a predetermined minimum value, 
and when said distance again rises 
above said predetermined 
minimum value; 
before the distance between two consecutive yarn turns 
falls below the predetermined minimum value, activating a 

motive source which by means of a lever linkage 
progressively inclines the conical bobbin to vary its 

transmission ratio with the cylindrical roller, in order to 
maintain the distance between consecutive turns about a 

value slightly greater than the predetermined minimum value 
and to progressively increase the bobbin inclination each 

time the distance between said consecutive turns tends to 
fall, at least until the deposition of consecutive turns at 

a distance apart less than the predetermined minimum value 
ceases; 
quickly restoring the initial conditions by operating the 
motive source to incline the bobbin in the opposite 

direction, to annul the previously induced inclination and 
cause a change in the transmission ratio, which at a 

certain moment assumes a value corresponding to deposition 
of turns at a distance apart less than the predetermined 

minimum distance and even zero distance apart, but with a 
rapidity such as to cause only an insignificant quantity of 

 
turns to be deposited very close to or superposed on each 

other, and which does not damage the quality of the bobbin 
under formation. 
A winding method for distributing wound yarn as claimed 
in claim 1 on a forming cylindrical bobbin driven by a 

drive cone in a collection station of a winding machine, 
for example an automatic winder, in which in said 

collection station the drive cone rotates at constant 
rotational speed and the bobbin, which rests under pressure 

on the drive cone, is provided with the necessary rotation 
to cross the yarn by unwinding it from the underlying feed 

package, said method being characterised by: 

determining moment by moment the deposition distance 
between two yarn turns successively deposited on the 

surface of the cylindrical bobbin under formation; 
on the basis of previously recorded successive variations 
in distance between two consecutive turns, determining when 

said distance falls below a predetermined minimum value, 
and when said distance again rises above said predetermined 

minimum value; 
before the distance between two consecutive yarn turns 
falls below the predetermined minimum value, activating a 

motive source which by means of a lever linkage 
progressively inclines the cylindrical bobbin to vary its 

transmission ratio with the drive cone, in order to 
maintain the distance between consecutive turns about a 

value slightly greater than the predetermined minimum value 
and to progressively increase the bobbin inclination each 

 
time the distance between said consecutive turns tends to 

fall, at least until the deposition of consecutive turns at 
a distance apart less than the predetermined minimum value 

ceases; 
quickly restoring the initial conditions by operating the 
motive source to incline the cylindrical bobbin in the 

opposite direction, to annul the previously induced 
inclination and cause a change in the transmission ratio, 

which at a certain moment assumes a value corresponding to 
deposition of turns at a distance apart less than the 

predetermined minimum distance and even zero distance 
apart, but with a rapidity such as to cause only an 

insignificant quantity of turns to be deposited very close 
to or superposed on each other, and which does not damage 

the quality of the bobbin under formation. 
An apparatus for implementing the method claimed in 
claim 1, characterised by comprising a control unit based 

on a mini-computer into which the values relating to the 
winding parameters, those ribbing orders considered 

damaging to the quality of the winding underway, and the 
predetermined minimum distance between two consecutive yarn 

turns in one complete to-and-fro deposition of the yarn on 
the surface of the forming bobbin are firstly fed via a 

keyboard, said values being processed in the computing 
centre of the mini-computer for the computerised formation 

of a group of curves each having a constant "winding ratio" 
of whole number or exact fraction considered dangerous, the 

mini-computer then receiving electrical pulses generated at 
 

each revolution, or submultiple thereof, of the drive 
roller and bobbin carrier mandrel by known transducer 

probes applied to them, to unambiguously provide knowledge 
of the rotational values of said members at each moment, 

these latter values being compared with said operational 
winding parameters within the electronic comparator of the 

mini-computer, in order to generate a number of command 
signals in continuous succession to activate and control 

the motive source which angularly positions the bobbin 
carrier arm such that the collection station operates in 

regions not in proximity to the ribbing effect. 
An apparatus for distributing wound yarn on a forming 
bobbin as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that one 

apparatus of the present invention is provided in each yarn 
winding station. 
A collection station equipped with an apparatus which 
enables yarn to be wound by distributing it on the forming 

bobbin such that this latter is free from damaging ribbing, 
in accordance with claims 1 to 3.
