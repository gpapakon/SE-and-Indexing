A method of purifying exhaust gases wherein

the gases are subjected to an electric discharge, at least one electrode
being separated from the discharge chamber by a dielectric barrier,

and
the exhaust gases are subjected to contact with catalytic material,
characterised in that

catalytic material is applied to the dielectric or constitutes the dielectric and/or
a metal oxide, a ceramic or a zeolite or a mixture thereof is applied to at least

one electrode.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the discharge of
the exhaust gas occurs at approximately atmospheric pressure.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the gas
discharge occurs in an oxidising atmosphere.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the gas
discharge occurs in an inert or reducing atmosphere.
A method according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 the
excitation energy, excitation voltage, excitation frequency or mixture of

excitation frequencies of the gas discharge are so chosen that radicals, for
example oxygen radicals, are generated during the discharge.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
that
 the gas discharge consists of short electric discharges having a duration
which is short compared with the thermalisation time. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
that
 the gas discharge is entirely or partly ignited in cavities formed by the
catalyst.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
that
 the discharge occurs in at least two discharge zones and is excited in the
various zones by various excitation energies, various excitation voltages,

various excitation frequencies, various mixtures of excitation frequencies or
various forms of voltage or tension.
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
that
 the discharge in at least one discharge zone is intermittent.
A device of purifying exhaust gases, wherein the gases are subjected
to an electric discharge and to contact with catalytic material, the device

comprising a region for electric gas discharge in which at least one electrode
is separated from the discharge chamber by a dielectric barrier, wherein

catalytic material is applied to the dielectric or constitutes the dielectric and/or
a metal oxide, a ceramic, a zeolite or a mixture thereof is applied to at least

one electrode.
A device according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 at least one
electrode in the discharge region is of catalyst material.
A device for purifying exhaust gas according to claim 10 or 11,

characterised in that
 a catalyst having a large surface area, for example

porous or in the form of a granulate, a network, and/or fibres is disposed in
the region containing catalyst material.
A device for purifying exhaust gases according to any of claims 10 to
12, 
characterised in that
 capillaries made of catalytic electrically insulating
material are present in the gas discharge region and are suitable for forming

a surface or capillary discharge. 
A device for purifying exhaust gas according to any of claims 10 to 13,

characterised in that
 the gas discharge region comprises at least two
separate gas discharge regions and/or the region containing catalyst material

comprises at least two separate regions containing catalyst material.
