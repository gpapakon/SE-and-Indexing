The present invention relates to an acoustic reproducing apparatus for a 
reproduced sound from a speaker used in various acoustic appliances by a 
microphone, feeding back negatively to the input signal to the speaker by 
this detected signal to improve the reproduction frequency characteristic, 
distortion factor and other characteristics of the speaker, and correcting 
the reproduced sound. In an acoustic reproducing apparatus, in order to improve a reproduced 
sound from a speaker, it has been attempted to detect the reproduced sound by 
a microphone, feed back negatively to the input signal of the speaker by this 
detected signal to improve the reproduction frequency characteristic, 
distortion factor and other characteristics of the speaker, and correct the 
reproduced sound. A prior example of this kind of acoustic reproducing 
apparatus is described below by reference to drawings. Fig. 57 is a block diagram showing a constitution of an acoustic  
 
reproducing apparatus using a negative feedback circuit of a prior art. A 
signal is fed from an input terminal 50, and is supplied from a positive 
input terminal of a subtractor 51, and its output is amplified in power in a 
power amplifier 52, and the signal is applied to a speaker 53. The acoustic 
signal issued from the speaker 53 is detected by a microphone 54, and this 
signal is amplified in a microphone amplifier 55, and its output signal is 
passed through a filter 56 and is connected to a negative input terminal of 
the subtractor 51, thereby forming a negative feedback loop. Fig. 58 is a block diagram showing a constitution in which the speaker 
53 of the acoustic reproducing apparatus shown in Fig. 57 is incorporated 
into a speaker box 58 using a passive radiator 57, wherein a signal fed into 
the input terminal 50 is passed into the subtractor 51 thorough the positive 
input terminal, and is amplified in power in the power amplifier 52, and the 
output signal from the power amplifier 52 is reproduced by the speaker 53 
coupled inside the speaker box 58. At the rear side of the speaker 53, an 
enclosed acoustic space 58A is formed, and further an enclosed acoustic space 
58B is also formed at the front side of the speaker 53, and by the passive 
radiator 57 coupled between the enclosed acoustic space 58B and the opening 
of the speaker box 58, an acoustic output is radiated into the front space of 
the speaker box 58, and the acoustic output signal radiated from the passive
