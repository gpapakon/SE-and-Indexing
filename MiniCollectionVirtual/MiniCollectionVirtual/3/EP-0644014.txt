<ABSTRACT>
When a welding tip (18) is moved from one welding 
point to a successive welding point, a robot (11) and a 

welding gun (12) are operated simultaneously with each other 
during a first time period between an issue of a 

pressurizing start signal and finish of the pressurizing, 
and again during a second time period between an issue of a 

depressurization signal and finish of the depressurization 
so that a pressurization time period t₁ and a 

depressurization time period t₂ are eliminated from a 
welding cycle time and the welding cycle time is shortened. 

A welding gun (12) which includes a servo motor (21) and a 
ball screw (22) for convert
ing a rotation of the servo motor 
(21) to a stroke of the welding tip (18) is used, and the 

stroke of the welding tip (18) is counted as one axis of the 
robot (11), and the welding tip motion is controlled by a 

robot controller (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding 
apparatus which can shorten a time period needed for moving 
a welding tip from a weld point to a successive weld point 
and an operation method thereof. As illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, a conventional 
spot welding apparatus has a general purpose robot 1 and a 
welding gun 3 mounted to a wrist 2 of the robot 1. In the 
welding apparatus, the welding gun has a welding tip 4 which 
is driven by an air cylinder. The robot 1 and the welding gun 3 are operated 
according to an operation timing schedule shown in FIG. 7. 
More particularly, when or after the welding gun has reached 
a position corresponding to a welding point, a pressurizing 
start instruction is issued and the pressurizing motion 
continues for a time period t₁. After pressurizing, welding 
starts by applying an electric current to the welding tip. 
After terminating the electric current, a depressurization 
start instruction is issued and the depressurization 
continues for a time period t₂. When or after 
depressurization has finished, the welding gun moves toward 
the successive welding point driven by the robot.  However, the pressurizing time period t₁ and the 
pressurizing release time period t₂ lengthen the welding 
cycle time. An object of the invention is to provide a welding 
apparatus and an operation method thereof wherein a welding 
cycle time is not lengthened by the pressurization and 
depressurization processes so that welding cycle time is 
shortened compared with the above-described conventional 
welding method. The above and other objects, features, and 
advantages of the present invention will become more 
apparent and will be more readily appreciated from the 
following detailed description of the preferred embodiments 
of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying 
drawings, in which:

in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a control system of
