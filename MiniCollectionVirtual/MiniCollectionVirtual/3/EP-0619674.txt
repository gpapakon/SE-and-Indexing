<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of producing positive 
photographic prints in hybrid photofinishing system 

employing a digital image printer to produce an 
intermediate negative image on a non-photographic 

medium wherein digital data used to print the negative 
includes code values simulating an orange mask effect 

in the negative. The improvement in the method 
involves a reduction in the orange mask values in the 

digital data so as to reduce the D-max values required 
for digitally printing the intermediate negative 

thereby reducing print cost and throughput time in the 
process. In a further improvement, the printer code 

values for pixels corresponding to full white in the 
final image are forced to values that print as black in 

the negative thereby eliminating the orange mask effect 
for these pixels and rendering improved rendition of 

full white areas in the final image print.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of 
photo-reproduction systems and more specifically to 
method and apparatus for producing color internegatives 
for digitally stored images' data bases. Recent improvements in the spatial and data 
resolution capabilities of digital color image 
processing systems have made such systems particularly 
attractive for a variety of photo-processing (e.g. 
photo-finishing) applications. In still color image 
photography, for example, once an image (such as that 
captured on color photographic film or a high 
resolution color digital camera) has been digitized and 
stored in an attendant data base, it is readily 
optimized for reproduction by means of photofinishing 
image processing software. One example of a color 
photo-finishing system that takes advantage of this 
capability is disclosed in co-pending patent 
application Serial No. 582,305, filed September 14, 
1990, by S. Kristy entitled "Multiresolution Digital 
Imagery Photofinishing System," assigned to the 
assignee of the present application and the disclosure 
of which is herein incorporated. As described in that application, conventional 
photo-finishing of consumer-generated still color 
photographs (e.g. those captured on 35mm color film) 
involves the use of an analog electro-optic system and  
 
an associated chemical-based print developing unit. In 
the above-referenced Kristy application, there is 
described a digital image-based photofinishing 
apparatus that enables the personal customizing and 
obtaining of high quality prints of photographic 
images; it also provides for the storage and retrieval 
of high resolution digitized color still images for 
playback to a variety of reproduction devices. To this end, as diagrammatically illustrated in 
Figure 1, the digital-image-based photofinishing 
apparatus employs a high resolution opto-electronic 
film scanner 12, the output of which is coupled to a 
digitized image processing computer 14. Scanner 12 may 
comprise a commercially available Eikonix Model 1435 
high resolution scanner, having a very high resolution 
sensor pixel array (a 3072 X 2048 pixel matrix) capable 
of generating high spatial density-representative 
output signals which, when converted into digital 
format, yield 'digitized' photographic image files from 
which high quality color prints may be obtained. 
Scanner 12 is arranged to be optically coupled with a 
photographic recording medium, such as a conventional 
35mm color film strip 16. Film strip 16 typically 
contains

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing an image from first 
digital image data in a system employing a digital 

image printer to print a complement of the image onto a 
non-photographic recording medium for subsequent use in 

photographically reproducing said image on a 
photographic print medium, the method comprising the 

steps of: 
   processing said first digital image data to derive 

second digital data representative of a complement of 
said image and incorporating in the second digital data 

a modified orange mask value for reproduction of said 
image on the photographic medium, said modified orange 

mask value being less by a predetermined amount than a 
full orange mask value required for desired 

reproduction of the image on the photographic print 
medium; 

   operating said printer in accordance with said 
second digital data to cause said printer to print said 

complement image onto said non-photographic medium with 
said modified orange mask value; and 

   illuminating said photographic print medium with 
the complement image on said non-photographic medium 

with illumination compensated to introduce an orange 
mask effect corresponding to said predetermined amount 

of orange mask value absent in said second digital 
data. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said 
illumination is applied through color balance filters 

adjusted to introduce said orange mask effect into the 
illumination. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said 
illumination is applied through a uniform orange 

density material having an orange density equivalent to 
said orange mask effect. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said 
modified orange mask value in the second digital data 

is further modified to a maximum density value which 
eliminates any orange mask value for those image pixels 

corresponding to full white in the image on the 
photographic print medium. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said 
second digital data is further modified to a value that 

prints as black in the complement image on the non-photographic 
medium for those image pixels

said color image, said second digital data being 

comprised of a digital code value for each of separate 
color components in each pixel of said color image, 

each code value including an added density value 
generally corresponding to an orange mask in the 

complement image, said added density value being less 
by an amount equivalent to a D-min representative 

parameter in the complement image;
 

   operating said printer in accordance with said 
second digital data to cause said printer to print said 

complement image onto said non-photographic medium with 
said added density values; and 

   illuminating said photographic print medium with
