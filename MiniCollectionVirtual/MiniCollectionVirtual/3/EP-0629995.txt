<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a receiver 
device for converting electrical signal from a headphone, a 

telephone receiver or the like into acoustic signals and 
outputting these acoustic signals. More particularl
y, it 
relates to a noise reducing receive device in which acoustic 

signals in the vicinity of an electro-acoustic transducer 
element are converted by a microphone into electrical signals 

and negatively fed back to an amplifier circuit which is 
adapted for amplifying input electrical signals and supplying 

the amplified signals to the electro-acoustic transducer 
element. With the present noise reducing receiver device, 

the input electrical signals are amplified by the amplifier 
circuit and converted by the electro-acoustic transducer 

element into acoustic signals, which are output as output 
acoustic signals. A microphone, consisting of a pair of 

microphone units (16A,16B) having their diaphragms (16a,16b) 
disposed in proximity and in opposition to each other, is 

arranged in the vicinity of the electro-acoustic transducer 
element and adapted for converting the output acoustic 

signals and external noises into electrical signals, which 
are negatively fed back to the amplifier circuit via 

feedback circuit. The output acoustic signals may be heard 
at the desired noise reduction level by having the transfer 

function H of the electro-acoustic transducer element, the 
transfer function A of the amplifier circuit, the transfer  

 
function M of the microphone and the transfer function β 

of the feedback circuit presettable within the range of 
|AHMβ|»1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a so-called active type noise 
reducing receiver device for converting electrical signals 
into acoustic signals and outputting these acoustic signals. 
More particularly, it relates to a noise reducing receiver 
device in which acoustic signals in the vicinity of an 
electro-acoustic transducer element are converted by a 
microphone into electrical signals and negatively fed back 
for noise reduction to an amplifier circuit which is adapted 
for amplifying input electrical signals and supplying the 
amplified signals to the electro-acoustic transducer element. As a headphone device or a receiver attached to the 
listener's ear, a passive type device making use only of an 
electro-acoustic transducer element is used extensively. However, with such passive type headphone device, not 
only its acoustic output, but also the noise from the 
surrounding is input to the listener's ear. For this reason, 
a so-called active type noise-reducing headphone device has 
recently been proposed, as disclosed for example in US 
Patents 4455675 and 4494074, according to which the noise in  
 
the vicinity of the headphone unit is reduced by a negative 
feedback loop, by means of which output acoustic signals in 
the vicinity of the headphone unit adapted to output acoustic 
signals converted from electrical signals are converted into 
electrical signals and fed back with an antiphase relation to 
the input electrical signals. Referring to Fig. 1, in which the basic construction of 
the above mentioned active type noise reducing headphone 
device is illustrated, a microphone unit 6 is provided in the 
vicinity of a headphone unit 4 attached to a listener's ear 
20, and a signal synthesizer 2 is provided at an input side 
of an amplifier 3 which is adapted for amplifying an input 
electrical signal S applied from a signal source 10 to a 
signal input terminal 1 before supplying the signal to the 
headphone unit 4. The acoustic signals in the vicinity of 
the headphone unit 4 are converted by the microphone unit 6 
into electrical signals which are supplied via feedback 
circuit 7 to the signal synthesizer 2 where the input 
electrical signal S and feedback signals output from the 
feedback circuit 7 are summed together before being supplied 
to the amplifier 3 by way of performing a negative feedback 
around the amplifier 3. As in the above described active type noise reducing 
headphone device, the noise level in the acoustic signal 
input to the listener's ear 20 may be reduced by summing  
 
ac
