The use of an aqueous polymer dispersion based on 
acrylate-methacrylate copolymers as lamination adhesives 

for glossy films, where the aqueous polymer dispersions 
have a solids content of from 20 to 65 % by weight, the 

copolymer has a glass transition temperature of from -35 
to -10°C, a K value of from 40 to 100 and a mean particle 

size of less than 200 nm, and the copolymer is obtainable 
by free-radical emulsion polymerization of 


a) from 50 to 80 parts by weight of one or more comonomere 
from the group consisting of alkyl acrylates of 

alcohols having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, 
b) from 10 to 25 parts by weight of one or more comonomere 
from the group consisting of alkyl methacrylates 

of alcohols having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and 
c1) from 0 to 10 parts by weight of one or more vinyl-aromatic 
comonomers, 
c2) from 0.1 to 4.0 parts by weight of one or more α,β-unsaturated, 
monoolefinic carboxylic acids, 
c3) from 0 to 4.0 parts by weight of one or more α,β-unsaturated, 
monoolefinic carboxamides, 
c4) from 0 to 8 parts by weight of one or more 
comonomers from the group consisting of hydroxyalkyl 

(meth)acrylates made from esters of acrylic acid or 
methacrylic acid and diols having 2 to 10 carbon 

atoms, and 
c5) from 0.1 to 4.0 parts by weight of one or more α,β-unsaturated, 
monoolefinic compounds containing 

sulfonyl or sulfonate groups. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
comonomer phase contains 


a) from 50 to 80 parts by weight of one or more comonomere 
from the group consisting of ethylhexyl acrylate 

and n-butyl acrylate, 
b) from 10 to 25 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate, 
c1) from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of styrene, 
c2) from 0.1 to 4.0 parts by weight of one or more  
 

comonomers from the group consisting of acrylic 
acid, methacrylic acid and crotonic acid, 
c3) from 0.1 to 4.0 parts by weight of one or more 
comonomers from the group consisting of acrylamide 

and methacrylamide, 
c4) from 0.5 to 8 parts by weight of one or more comonomers 
of the group consisting of hydroxyethyl acrylate 

and hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and 
c5) from 0.1 to 4.0 parts by weight of one or more 
comonomers from the group consisting of acrylamidopropanesulfonic 

acid, vinylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic 
acid and the salts thereof. 
The use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
solids content of the aqueous polymer dispersion is from 

30 to 55 % by weight, where the polymer has a glass 
transition temperature of from -25 to -15°C, and a K 

value of from 70 to 100 and a mean particle size of 
150 nm and a Brookfield viscosity (20 rpm) of 1000 mPas 

are not exceeded. 
The use as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
aqueous polymer dispersion in the lamination of glossy 

films is applied to plastic films over the entire area, 
preferably in a thickness of from 5 to 50 µm, is subsequently 

dried and, for the production of laminates, the 
dried polymer film is covered with the paper or cardboard 

packaging sheet to be laminated and heat-sealed at a 
suitable temperature and under pressure.
