<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are disclosed for integrating multimedia presentations into an object oriented 
user interface which includes multiple polymorphic objects which each have associated encapsulated 

data and functionality. Multiple separate user selectable data views are defined for each object which 
provide different views of the data associated with an object. Selection by a user of an audio or video 

data view for an object results in the provision of a multimedia presentation by automatically coupling 
audio or video data to an appropriate device. Audio data are directly associated with an object or 

derived in response to selection of an audio data view, by means of a text-to-speech process, or 
other similar technique. Encapsulating multimedia data within an object integrates multimedia 

presentation capability within an object without requiring separate audio or video objects which must 
be manipulated by the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved multimedia within a data processing system. The use of multimedia within computer user interfaces is growing very rapidly. Diverse media, 
such as text, graphics, image, audio and video may be combined to provide a highly interactive and 
communicative user interface, greatly contributing to an overall increase in productivity and user 
satisfaction. Known approaches to providing multimedia support within data processing systems typically 
involve providing a "player" interface for each multimedia object. For example, audio and video are 
typically treated as individual objects and control panels representing cassette tape players, video 
cassette recorders, laser disc players and other such devices are graphically displayed in order to 
permit the user to access recorded information by graphically manipulating the audio or video object 
with the "player" device. While this approach provides a logical and effective technique whereby multimedia may be 
utilized within a data processing system, the requirement to provide graphic representations of various 
"player" devices, in order to access each different type of multimedia output can be quite burdensome 
for the programmer. It can also be quite distracting for users who typically wish to focus on their data. Recently, so-called "object oriented programming" interfaces have been proposed for utilization 
within complex computer systems. An interface which is object oriented is typically characterized by 
three important features which distinguish such systems from traditional programming languages. 
Firstly, the "objects" within an object oriented programming system are typically "polymorphic," that is, 
each object has the ability to respond to an identical message in a different way. Thus, when an object 
receives a command a translator is provided which determines what the response of that object should 
be to that type of command. Next, the objects within an object oriented user interface demonstrate "inheritance" or the ability 
of an object to derive its data and functionality automatically from another object. Finally, an object is  
 
said to be "encapsulated" when its private data are protected from outside access. That is, no other 
object will be able to access the object's internal data. Another common characteristic of object oriented user interfaces is the data view separation 
model. This model is based upon the premise that objects within an object oriented user interface are 
separable into data
