<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conductive polymer complex which 
contains a polyaniline or derivative thereof doped with a 

protonic acid. By the method according to the invention, a 
conductive polymer is obtained the acidity of which has been 

substantially reduced, the conductivity level of which is 
sufficiently high, and which is suitable, for example, for 

being melt processed in conventional plastics processing 
apparatus. The acidity of the conductive polymer can be 

reduced by having the conductive polymer contain both a metal 
compound and an additionally neutralizing compound. The 

obtained conductive polymer material, having a pH value of 
approx. 3 - 8, can be mixed with an insulating polymer to 

produce a conductive plastics mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrically conductive polymer
material which contains a polyaniline or derivative thereof
doped with a protonic acid, and a method for its production.
By the method according to the invention, a conductive polymer
material is obtained the acidity of which is substantially
reduced, the conductivity of which is sufficiently
high, and which is suitable, for example, for being melt-processed
in conventional plastics processing apparatus.Electrically conductive polymers are at present subject to
great interest in different parts of the world. These polymers
can be used for replacing metal conductors and semiconductors
in a number of applications, such as batteries,
sensors, switches, light cells, circuit boards, heating
elements, electrostatic discharge elimination (ESD), and
electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI). The advantages
of conductive polymers over metals include their light
weight, mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and less
expensive synthesis and processing methods.Electrically conductive plastics can be divided roughly into
two categories: filled conductive plastics, in which a
conductive filler, such as carbon black or soot, carbon fiber
or metal powder is added to a thermosetting or thermoplastic
resin, and intrinsically conductive plastics, which are based
on polymers which have been rendered electrically conductive
by oxidation, reduction or protonation (doping).The electrical conductivity of filled conductive polymers is
dependent on mutual contacts between the conductive filler
particles. Usually a well dispersed filler is needed at approx.
10 - 50 wt.% to produce composites having a good conductance.
However, such conductive composites involve 
problems; their mechanical and certain of their chemical
properties are crucially impaired as the filler content
increases and the polymer content decreases, their
conductivity is difficult to control especially within the
semiconductor range, and stable and homogenous dispersing of
their filler into the matrix plastic is difficult.Intrinsically conductive plastics can be prepared from
organic polymers containing long conjugated chains formed by
double bonds and heteroatoms. The polymers can be rendered
conductive by modifying the π- and π-p-electron systems in
their double bonds and heteroatoms by adding to the polymer
certain blending or doping agents which will serve as
electron receptors or electron donors in the polymer. Thereby
electron holes or extra electrons are formed in the polymer
chain,
