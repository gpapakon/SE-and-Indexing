<ABSTRACT>
An irrigator with an oscillating arm comprises an 
oscillating arm (1) constituted by a hollow cylinder provided 

with a longitudinal succession of holes (8) suitable for the 
passage of an irrigation liquid, and first means operated by 

said liquid suitable for determining the oscillation of the arm 
(1) round its own axis; a cylindrical sleeve (9) is inserted 

coaxially in said oscillating arm (1) in a freely rotatable 
manner with respect to the arm (1) itself and it is provided 

with at least one surface groove (11; 15) for the passage of 
the irrigation liquid, having a longitudinal shape suitable for 

determining the simultaneous opening of one part of the 
abovementioned holes (8) with which the arm (1) is provided, 

the remaining holes (8) being obstructed by the sleeve (9); 
second means operated by the irrigation liquid determine the 

relative rotation of the sleeve (9) inside the arm (1) for the 
opening in succession of different holes (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an irrigator with an
oscillating arm.Irrigators for gardening are known
(see EP-A-0 394 653)
that comprise a hollow
arm provided with a longitudinal succession of holes for the
passage of water that, issuing from a water supply point, flows
inside the arm itself. The latter is made to oscillate round
its own axis, for example by means of a unit with a turbine and
means for transforming motion from rotatory to oscillatory, by
the pressure of the water, so as to irrigate alternately
portions of land located on opposite sides with respect to the
irrigator. The total irrigated land area has a width
corresponding to the length of the oscillating arm, and a
length equal to twice the maximum distance covered by the jets
of water issuing from the holes.Irrigators are also known wherein the width of the irrigated
area can be modulated by varying the length of the oscillating
arm, by means of plugs, sliding along the same arm to cover up
a desired number of holes, placed at the end of the arm.The total irrigated land area depends, however, not only on
the length of the oscillating arm, but also on the length of
the jet issuing from the individual holes, that is essentially
on the pressure of the water inside the arm; such pressure is 
linked to the number of holes obtained in the oscillating arm,
so that in arms of greater length and thus with more holes,
diminishing the pressure of water inside the arm, would
consequently diminish the length of the jet issuing from the
holes, and no benefit in terms of the irrigated area would thus
be obtained. For this reason in irrigators produced normally
the oscillating arms do not have more than 18 holes.A similar problem would be exhibited if, for an equal length
of the oscillating arm, the distance between the holes were to
be diminished so as to have a greater fineness in the
distribution of the water: as for the previous case, the
increase in the number of holes would determine a drop in the
pressure of the water and thus a reduction in the length of the
jet issuing from the holes themselves. If the pressure of
water were to be reduced excessively, the irrigator would no
longer be capable of carrying out its functions properly, since
the area of irrigated land would be reduced to a small region
surrounding the irrigator itself.In view of the described state of the art, the object of the
present invention is to provide an irrigator with an
oscillating arm wherein the arm itself can have a high number
of holes, so that it is possible to

<CLAIMS>
Irrigator with an oscillating arm, comprising an
oscillating arm (1) constituted by a hollow cylinder provided

with a longitudinal succession of holes (8) suitable for the
passage of an irrigation liquid, and first means operated by

said liquid suitable for effecting the oscillation of the arm
(1) round its own axis, characterized in that it comprises a

cylindrical sleeve (9) inserted coaxially in said oscillating
arm (1) in a freely rotatable manner with respect to the arm

(1) itself and provided with at least one surface groove
(11;15) for the passage of the irrigation liquid,

said at least one surface groove
having a

longitudinal shape suitable for determining the simultaneous
opening of one part of the abovementioned holes (8) with which

the arm (1) is provided, the remaining holes (8) being
obstructed by the

external surface of the
sleeve (9), and second means operated by the

irrigation liquid suitable for effecting the relative
rotation of the sleeve (9) inside the arm (1) for the opening

in succession of different holes (8)
by said at least one surface groove.
Irrigator according to claim 1, characterized in that
said said groove (11) has a helical shape.
Irrigator according to claim 1, characterized in that
said groove (15) consists of alternate sections of a right-hand

and a left-hand helix placed in succession and connected
together.
Irrigator according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
terminal section (13) of said sleeve (9) is manually rotatable

with respect to a remaining section (12) of the sleeve (9), to
allow one section of the groove (11) obtained on the surface of

said terminal section (13) to be staggered with respect to a
section of the groove (11) obtained on the surface of the

remaining section (12) of the sleeve (9) and consequently to
prevent the flow of irrigation liquid to a terminal section of

the oscillating arm (1).
Irrigator according to claim 4, characterized in that
said terminal section (13) of the sleeve (9) is coupled to said

remaining section (12) of the sleeve by means of an elastic
notched coupling (14), and is integral with a hand grip (10) to

allow its manual rotation with respect to the remaining section
(12).
