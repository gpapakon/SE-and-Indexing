<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cassette for an 
optical fiber device and, more particularly, such a 
cassette equipped with a bundle of tubes protecting the 
fibers extending from the cassette and with means to fasten 
an end of this bundle onto the cassette. For installing optical fiber telecommunication 
networks, it has been proposed to use cassettes of the type 
represented in figure 1 of the attached drawings. The 
cassette 1 is conceived to protect and to allow handling of 
an optical component 2 such as for example a 1xN coupler 
embodied in integrated optics. The optical fiber 3 extending out of one side of such 
a coupler and the N optical fibers 4 extending out of the 
other side of this coupler are guided, following paths of 
predetermined curvature, towards the end 5 of a bundle 6 of 
(N+1) tubes, each of them protecting the part of one of the 
fibers extending out of the cassette, as represented in the 
partially cut-away view of figure 1. It is advisable to ensure at the same time the 
attachment of the end 5 of the bundle onto the cassette and 
of each fiber in its own tube in order that tensions  
 
applied to the tube or the fiber will not disrupt the 
bundle/cassette attachment or shift the component 2 in the 
cassette. As it appears in the scheme of figure 2 of the 
attached drawings that represents a longitudinal section of 
the end of the bundle of fibers, the fiber 3, for example, 
is attached in its tube by a drop 7 of an adhesive product 
deposited at the mouth of the tube and drawn up into the 
tube by capillary attraction. In order to attach the bundle of tubes to the 
cassette, a flexible protective sleeve 8 is passed over the 
end of the bundle, and one or several steps 9₁,9₂ (figure 1) 
passing around the end of the bundle and around walls 10₁, 
10₂ formed into the cassette and defining a path for the 
bundle, are tightened around this bundle and these walls. Cassettes constituted in this way are submitted to 
standard heating/cooling cycles, in order to verify their 
ability of properly operating at any outside temperatures, 
comprising between -40°C and 85°C for example. During these 
tests, optical signal losses passing through the component 
are monitored. During these tests, it has been noticed 
that the structure of the attachment of the bundle of tubes 
described above was generating losses, notably at low 
temperatures (-40°C). In effect, as illustrated in figure 
2, the contraction of the tube that is observed at low 
temperatures, between the adhesive drop 7
