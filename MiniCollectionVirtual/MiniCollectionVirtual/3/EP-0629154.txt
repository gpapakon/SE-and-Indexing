Device for dusting flat products, especially printed 
products, with powder, comprising a powder box (24) which 

is open towards the transport plane (18) of the products 
and has a rear wall (38, 40, 42) and side walls (50), a 

powder nozzle arrangement (34) which is arranged in the 
powder box transversely to the product transport direction 

and delivers a powder/air mixture towards the 
product transport plane (18), a first air nozzle arrangement 

(30), which is arranged transversely to the product 
transport direction at the upstream edge of the powder 

box (24), and a second air nozzle arrangement (60), which 
is arranged transversely to the product transport 

direction at the downstream edge of the powder box (24), 
both of which air nozzle arrangements form a curtain of 

air (32, 62) directed towards the product transport plane 
(18), and two suction nozzle arrangements (33, 50) one of 

which is provided downstream of the first air nozzle 
arrangement (30) and the second of which is provided in 

the region of the downstream air nozzle arrangement (60), 
both of them being oriented transversely to the product 

transport plane (18), characterised in that a portion 
(42) of the rear wall (38-42) associated with a downstream 

box portion (28) is at a greater distance (H) from 
the product transport plane (18) than is a portion (38) 

of the rear wall (38, 40, 42) associated with an upstream 
box portion (26) adjacent to the powder nozzle arrangement 

(34). 
Dusting device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the top wall (40, 42) of the downstream box portion 

(28) is formed by an open-pored micro-pore material the 
surface of which facing away from the inside of the box 

is acted upon by compressed air (48).  
 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the downstream air nozzle arrangement (60) produces 

a curtain of air (62) having a velocity component 
directed counter to the product transport direction. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
curtain of air (62) produced by the downstream air nozzle 

arrangement (60) is inclined with respect to the product 
transport plane (18) at an angle of approximately 45Â°. 
Device according to any one of claims 1-4, characterised 

in that the downstream end wall (50) of the box 
is provided with openings (58) that lie above the 

downstream air nozzle arrangement (60) and that are in 
communication with a source of negative pressure. 
Device according to any one of claims 1-5, characterised 
in that the side walls (50) of the downstream box 

portion (28) are provided with openings (52) and are in 
communication with a negative pressure source (54). 
Device according to any one of claims 1-6, characterised 
in that the side walls (50) of the powder box 

(24) have further air nozzle arrangements (64, 66) that 
are in communication with a source of compressed air. 
Device according to any one of claims 1-7, characterised 
in that the side walls of the powder box (24) 

carry seals (78). 
Device according to any one of claims 1-8, characterised 
by a sheet guiding box (72) which lies opposite 

the powder box (24) relative to the product transport 
plane (18) and the guiding wall of which that faces the 

product transport plane (18) is provided with a plurality 
of openings that are in communication with a negative  

 
pressure source (76). 
Device according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the side walls of the sheet guiding box (72) carry seals 

(80) oriented towards the product transport plane (18). 
Device according to any one of claims 1-10, characterised 
in that the downstream air nozzle arrangement 

(60) is electrically insulated with respect to the 
downstream box portion (28), and a high-voltage source 

(82) of, for example, 3-8 kV is connected by its terminals 
to the downstream box portion (28) and to the 

downstream air nozzle arrangement (60).
