<ABSTRACT>
The knuckle bracket (B) is used to mount a vehicle shock 
absorber (3). The knuckle bracket (B) has an outer bracket (1) comprising 

a loop portion (4) and a pair of clamp portions (5) extending in parallel 
from the loop portion (4), and an inner bracket (2) comprising a curved 

backrest portion (6) and a pair of support pieces (7) extending in parallel 
from the backrest port
ion (6). The support pieces (7) of the inner 
bracket (2) are inserted between the clamp portions (5) of the outer 

bracket (1). A reinforcing bracket (17, 18, 19) is provided between 
the support pieces (7) of the inner bracket (1) to prevent 

deformation, tilting and disengagement of the knuckle bracket (B) 
as the shock absorber (3) operates. The reinforcing bracket (17, 

18, 19) is located between the ends of the inner bracket (2) and has 
a wall which is parallel to the backrest portion (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a knuckle bracket 
for use in mounting a strut type shock absorber which is 
disposed between a vehicle body and a wheel in 
order to support the vehicle body and absorb energy 
such as vibration from the road surface. A strut type shock absorber comprises an outer 
shell and a shock absorber inserted into the outer 
shell. A lower portion of the outer shell is connected 
to a wheel of a vehicle while being supported 
by a knuckle bracket. Known knuckle brackets of this type are 
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model 
Publication No. 13790/86, U.S. Patent No. 4,491,339 and 
Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 160442/81, and the 
structure shown in Fig. 4 attached hereto is a typical 
prior art structure. The knuckle bracket illustrated in Fig. 4 
and indicated at A comprises an outer bracket 1 and 
an inner bracket 2. The outer bracket 1 comprises a  
 
loop portion 4 which extends around an outer shell 3 
and a pair of clamp portions 5, 5 extending in 
parallel from the loop portion 4. The inner bracket 
2 comprises a curved backrest portion 6 which is in 
abutment with the outer shell 3 and a pair of support 
pieces 7, 7 extending in parallel from the backrest 
portion 6. A lower portion of the outer shell 3 with a shock 
absorber 8 inserted therein is located within the loop 
portion 4 of the outer bracket 1, and the support pieces 
7, 7 of the inner bracket 2 are clamped by the clamp 
portions 5, 5 of the outer bracket 1 while the backrest 
portion 6 of the inner bracket 2 is kept in abutment 
with the outer shell 3. The clamp portions 5 and the 
support pieces 7 are clamped together with bolts 
inserted into bolt holes 9. However, when a shock input from the road surface 
is large, a bending load acting in a lateral direction 
X-X or a longitudinal direction Y-Y in Fig. 4 is 
imposed on the outer shell 3 or the knuckle bracket A. 
In the case of a lateral load, the clamp portions 5, 5 
and the support pieces 7, 7 of the knuckle bracket A may 
become opened and deformed; as a result, there is a possibility 
that the knuckle bracket A will tilt or come off the outer shell 3.  
 German Petty Patent DE-U-8517424 published in 1985 proposes 
modifying the above-described known knuckle bracket by incorporating an 
outwardly-bent extension to the top of the backrest portion. The support 
pieces are extended upwards to meet the sides of the backrest extension. In U.S. Patent No. (US-A)4,618,162 (published 1986), there is 
disclosed a device which adjusts wheel camber on strut-type

<CLAIMS>
A knuckle bracket (B) for mounting on a cylindrical item such as a 
shock absorber (3), said knuckle bracket (B) comprising:- 


an outer bracket (1) having a loop portion, for receiving therein the 
cylindrical item (3), and a pair of clamp portions (5) extending substantially 

in parallel from said loop portion; 
an inner bracket (2) having a curved backrest portion (6) and a pair of 
support pieces (7) extending substantially in parallel from said backrest portion 

(6), said support pieces (7) being inserted between and clampable to said 
clamp portions (5) of said outer bracket (1) and said backrest portion (6) being 

abutable against the cylindrical item (3); and 
a reinforcing bracket (17, 18, 19) which comprises a first wall which 
(i) extends at least across the gap between said support pieces (7) and (ii) acts 

as a reinforcement to resist splaying apart of said support pieces (7);
 
   characterized in that said first wall is located between the ends of said 

inner bracket (2) and is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of said 
curved backrest portion (6). 
A knuckle bracket (B) according to claim 1, wherein said 
reinforcing bracket (17) comprises a bulge in a middle part of 

said backrest portion (6) of said inner bracket (2). 
A knuckle bracket (B) according to claim 1, wherein said 
reinforcing bracket (19) comprises a cutout piece cut out of one 

of said clamp portions (5) and extending through a cutout 
opening (20) in one of said support pieces (7) to the other one 

of said support pieces (7) or the other one of said clamp 
portions (5).  

 
A knuckle bracket (B) according to claim 1, wherein said 
reinforcing bracket (18) comprises a substantially U-shaped 

bracket (18) located between said support pieces (7), with the 
free ends of the arms of said substantially U-shaped bracket 

pointing towards said backrest portion (6). 
An assembly of a knuckle bracket (B) according to any one 
of claims 1 to 4 and a shock absorber (3), wherein said shock 

absorber (3) is located in said loop portion and said backrest 
portion (6) abuts against said shock absorber (3).
