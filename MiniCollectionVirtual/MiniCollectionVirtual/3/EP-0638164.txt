<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring properties of a slurry which comprises a slurry transporting section (16), means for measuring (14a) at a first inspection site the particle size distribution of a slurry entering the transporting section, means for measuring (14b) at a second inspection site the particle size distribution of slurry leaving the transporting section and means for calculating (13a, 13b) from the particle size distribution measured at the first and second inspection sites a parameter related to the floc strength of the slurry which has passed between the first and second inspection sites. The transporting section may comprise a pipe which includes a flow constriction. The transporting section may be a removable section fitted between a slurry inlet means and an outlet means. The said means for calculating may calculate one or more regression coefficients which define the curve described by the floc mass size equation or the breakage ratio defined by the mean floc sizes before and after breakage. The means for measuring particle size at each inspection may comprise a scanning laser microscope.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and a method 
for measuring one or more properties, especially related to 
floc strength, of a slurry. The lack of appropriate on-line and in-situ 
instrumentation for monitoring the size distribution of 
particulate matter in concentrated particulate (eg mineral) 
slurries has been a long standing and limiting constraint 
in the modelling and control of processing plants. 
Numerous on-line sizing instruments are available from 
commercial suppliers but, with few exceptions, these 
require sampling and/or dilution of the slurry prior to 
analysis. Such instruments utilise a variety of individual 
or hybrid sensing principles including ultrasonics, laser-diffraction, 
x-ray absorption and electrical properties. 
Alternative approaches have been suggested, such as 
centrifugal differentiation of particles according to their 
size in a spiral tube and detection of the resulting solids 
concentration variation across the tube using penetrating 
radiation. However, in all of these known categories of 
instrumentation the particulates are analysed in an 
environment that bears little resemblance to that 
encountered within the process stream or vessel to be used 
in a practical working system. Indeed, the solids 
concentration and the shear conditions often differ by 
several orders of magnitude. Consequently, the 
interpretation of results derived from such measuring 
devices has to be undertaken with some care, especially if 
the particulates are fine (<50Âµm) and prone to aggregation. According to the present invention in a first aspect 
there is provided an apparatus for measuring properties of 
a slurry which comprises a slurry transporting section, 
means for measuring at a first inspection site the particle 
size distribution of a slurry entering the transporting 
section, means for measuring at a second inspection site 
the particle size distribution of slurry leaving the  
 
transporting section and means for calculating from the 
particle size distribution measured at the first and second 
inspection sites a parameter related to the floc strength 
of the slurry which has passed between the first and second 
inspection sites. According to the present invention in a second aspect 
there is provided a method of measuring one or more 
properties of a slurry using the apparatus of the first 
aspect which comprises introducing a slurry to be 
investigated to the said first inspection site, measuring 
the particle size distribution at the first inspection 
site,

An apparatus for measuring properties of a slurry 
which comprises a slurry transporting section (16), means (14a) for 

measuring at a first inspection site the particle size 
distribution of a slurry entering the transporting 

section, means (14b) for measuring at a second inspection site 
the particle size distribution of slurry leaving the 

transporting section and means (13a, 13b) for calculating from the 
particle size distribution measured at the first and 

second inspection sites a parameter related to the floc 
strength of the slurry which has passed between the first 

and second inspection sites. 
Apparatus as in Claim 1 and wherein the transporting 
section comprises a pipe which includes a flow 

constriction. 
Apparatus as in Claim 1 or Claim 2 and wherein the 
transporting section is a removable section fitted between 

a slurry inlet means and an outlet means. 
Apparatus as in Claim 1, 2 or 3 and wherein the said 
means for calculating calculates one or more regression 

coefficients which define the curve described by the floc 
mass size equation. 
Apparatus as in Claim 1, 2 or 3 and wherein the said 
means for calculating calculates the breakage ratio 

defined by the mean floc sizes before and after breakage. 
Apparatus as in any one of the preceding claims and 
wherein the means for measuring the particle size 

distribution at the first inspection site and the means 
for measuring the particle size distribution at the second 

inspection site each comprise a scanning laser microscope. 
Apparatus as in Claim 6 and wherein each scanning 
laser microscope is capable of producing a laser beam spot 

which may be scanned at a fixed velocity within the slurry 
whereby the time taken for the beam to scan across a given 

particle is a direct measure of the size of that particle.  
 
Apparatus as in any one of the preceding claims and

particle size distribution at a third inspection site in 
an inlet means. 
A method of measuring one or more properties of a 
slurry using the apparatus of Claim 1 which comprises 

introducing a slurry to be investigated to the said first 
inspection site, measuring the particle size distribution 

at the first inspection site, passing the slurry through 
the transporting section, measuring the particle size 

distribution at the second inspection site and calculating 
from signals representing the said particle size 

distributions a parameter related to the floc strength of 
the slurry. 
A method as in Claim 9 and wherein the said 
calculation step includes calculating one or more 

regression coefficients which define the curve described 
by the floc mass size equation of the slurry and the 

method additionally includes varying the velocity gradient 
of the slurry in the said transporting section, measuring 

the different velocity gradients and plotting one or more 
of the said regression coefficients against the said 

velocity gradient to characterise the slurry material.
