<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a pelletizable pelletization resisting lumen bypass material obtained by subjecting a lumen bypass 
material, which is molded out of a biologically active ingredient and a protective substance, to a reinforcing treatment to withstand 

the mechanical stress imparted to the material during the pelletization thereof and humidifying and heating with steam; 
and a ruminant fodder pellet which contains the pelletization resisting lumen bypass material as a component. Namely, the present 

invention is directed to a pelletization resisting lumen bypass material obtained by mixing one or not less than two kinds of 
lumen bypass materials, which are molded out of a biologically active ingredient and a protective substance, in a molded product 

of the above-mentioned various kinds of high polymers (pelletization resisting protective agents) having shape retaining characteristics 
in a pelletization step; and a ruminant fodder pellet using this pelletization resisting lumen bypass material. This invention 

enables a lumen bypass material-containing fodder pellet, the practical use of which was impossible in the past, to be put to 
practical use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technology to include a rumen 
by-pass formulation of a feed additive for ruminants in a feed pellet. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a pelletization-resistant 
rumen by-pass formulation of a feed additive which can be 
pelletized without loosing its rumen by-pass property by coating the 
rumen bypass formulation molded from biologically active principles and 
protective matrices with pelletization-resistant protective matrices 
such as natural macromolecules and synthetic macromolecules as a 
reinforcement measure to resist to a mechanical stress imposed during 
pelletization process and to humidification and heating at steaming, 
etc., and feed pellets for ruminants comprising said pelletization-resistant 
rumen bypass formulation containing the feed additive as the 
component. In breeding of ruminants, simultaneous feeding of the rumen bypass 
formulation with fodders has been spreading among livestock farmers 
because such method is dietetically and clinically advantageous. 
However, there is a problem that livestock do not like the taste of 
rumen bypass formulation, and that a work to individually weigh and feed 
the rumen bypass formulation is quite troublesome for the livestock 
farmers. On the other hand, the use of feed pellets have also been 
spread among the livestock farmers since it can reduce labors required  
 
for feeding operation and give a chance to automate the operation. Therefore, it is expected that a feed pellet comprising the rumen 
bypass formulation as its component can be an useful feed for livestock, 
as it can utilize both advantages of the rumen bypass formulation and 
the feed pellet and may solve the problems described above. The rumen bypass formulation for ruminants described above 
comprises one or more of various amino acids, various vitamins and other 
biologically active principles, and which has a function to restrict 
the elution and the microbiological degradation of the biologically 
active principles in a rumen (first ruminant stomach) of ruminants while 
to allow the elution and absorption of the biologically active 
principles in digestive organs after fourth ruminant stomach. The 
concept and many practical examples of the rumen bypass formulation 
have already been known to the public. However, the rumen bypass formulation in the past appear to have 
been composed without considering the pelletization thereof. Such rumen 
bypass formulations, either in a form protectively coating the 
particles of
