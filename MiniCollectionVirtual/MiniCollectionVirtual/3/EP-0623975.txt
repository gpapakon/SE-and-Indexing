<ABSTRACT>
The device provides at least one thrust member (90), mounted on a component (71) of the socket (70) and positioned between the plug (10) and the shell of the socket (70), which exerts an axial force making it possible for them to undergo an axial relative movement, and a drive element (100), interacting with the said thrust element (90) in such a way that actuation of the said drive element (100) ensures the said axial relative movement and therefore extraction of the conductors (18) of the plug (10) from the socket contacts or grippers (72) of the socket (70).

<CLAIMS>
Claims for the following Contracting States : AT, BE, DE, FR, NL, SE
Device for pulling out an electric plug (10) 
inserted in a matching socket (70), said socket 

comprising a housing for receiving the plug (10) and 
lugs or clips (72) located within the housing and the 

cooperation of which with contact pins (18) of the 
plug (10) ensures transmission of the electric power, 

said device being incorporated in a component (71) of 
the socket (70) and comprising at least a movable 

thrust member to separate the plug (10) from the 
socket (70) cooperating with a control member (100) 

mounted on said component (71) of the socket (70), 
characterized in that the control member (100) 

performs a rotational movement with respect to the 
socket and is associated with means (91, 101) 

converting this rotational movement into an axial 
movement so as to move the thrust member (90). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the means (91, 101) converting the rotational 

movement into an axial movement provide for a 
reduction of the torque to be applied on the control 

member (100). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the means converting the 

rotational movement into an axial movement are made of 
slots (101) cooperating with studs (91). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the component (71) of 

the socket (70) comprises at least a longitudinal slot 
(81) guiding the thrust member (90). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it includes resilient 

means (103) connected to the control member (100) so 
as to drive said device back in inoperative position. 
Device according to any of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the thrust member (90) 
and the control member (100) are mounted on standard 

elements, such as the cover protection plates (71) of 
the housings of sockets (70), so that such new set of 

parts comes in the place of said standard elements. 
Claims for the following Contracting States : CH, ES, GB, IT, LI
Device for pulling out an electric plug (10) 
inserted in a matching socket (70), said socket 

comprising a housing for receiving the plug (10) and 
lugs or clips (72) located within the housing and the 

cooperation of which with contact pins (18) of the 
plug (10) ensures transmission of the electric power, 

said device being incorporated in a component (71) of 
the socket (70) and comprising at least a movable 

thrust member to separate the plug (10) from the 
socket (70) cooperating with a control member (100) 

mounted on said component (71) of the socket (70), 
characterized in that the thrust member (90) performs 

an axial movement and the control member (100) 
includes means (91, 101) such that its actuation 

powers the axial movement of the thrust member (90). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the control member (100) performs a rotational 

movement. 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the means ensuring the 

cooperation between the control member (100) and the 
thrust member (90) include slots (101) cooperating 

with studs (91). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the component (71) of 

the socket (70) comprises at least a longitudinal slot 
(81) guiding the thrust member (90). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it incorporates resilient 

means (103) connected to the control member 
(100) so as to drive said device back in inoperative 

position. 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized by means converting the 

rotational movement of the control member (100) into  
 

an axial movement of the thrust member (90) and 
providing for a reduction of the torque to be applied 

to the control member. 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the thrust member (90) 

and the control member (100) are mounted on standard 
elements, such as the cover protection plates (71) of 

the housings of sockets (70), so that such new set of 
parts comes in the place of said standard elements.
