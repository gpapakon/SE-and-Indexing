<ABSTRACT>
A steering lock device which comprises: a key cylinder (14) rotatably provided in a sleeve (13) disposed in 
a frame (11); a first rotor (16) provided in such a manner as to be rotatable relative to the sleeve (13), movable in an 

axial direction and cam-connected to the key cylinder (14); a second rotor (18) operationally coupled to a locking rod 
(32) and an ignition switch (28); and a connector (17) disposed between the first rotor (16) and the second rotor (18). 

When the key cylinder (14) is rotated relatively to the sleeve (13), the key cylinder (14) is coupled to the second rotor 
(18) and the locking rod (32) is moved from a lock position to an unlock position. When a key of a foreign type is 

inserted into the key cylinder (14), the key cylinder (14) is rotated integrally with the sleeve (13), so that the locking 
rod (32) can not be moved to the unlock position. When a steering lock device (10) is illegally unlocked, the key 

cylinder (14) is totally free to rotate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to lock devices, and more
particularly, to a steering lock device that provides significant resistance
to destruction, damage or tampering.In the conventional cylinder lock devices, the proper key can be rotated
to the locked position or the unlocked position in a key cylinder having
tumblers which are engaged with grooves formed within a case. In a conventional
steering lock device that prevents the rotation of the key cylinder by
means of the tumblers engaged with the grooves within the case, there is a
danger that unauthorized unlock will occur as a result of damage to the tumblers.
Thus, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 1-315569,
a free-turn type cylinder lock has been proposed, wherein a key cylinder
is designed, so that it can be freely rotated against an unauthorized
attempt to unlock when rotational force is applied to the key cylinder. This
cylinder lock is provided with a sleeve rotatably arranged in a case and the
key cylinder rotatably supported within the sleeve.When the proper key is inserted into the key cylinder, tumblers within
the key cylinder are disengaged from grooves formed within the sleeve, and
thereby the key cylinder can be rotated relative to the sleeve, so that a
sliding ring engages with a lock-piece operating member to actuate the lock.
If a foreign key is inserted into the key cylinder, as the key cylinder is
kept in the condition that it is engaged with the sleeve by means of the
tumblers, the key cylinder rotates together with the sleeve. Thus, the 
lock-piece operating member is prevented from rotating, and thereby the lock device cannot
be actuated.In case a foreign key is used in this kind of free-turn type cylinder lock, the key
cylinder freely rotates. Therefore, since excessive rotation force that might break down the
tumblers cannot be given to the lock, significant resistance can be given to the lock against
damage or destruction.However, the lock device disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 1-315569 (&
US-A-4903512)
cannot be applied to a steering lock device. In order to apply the free-turn type cylinder lock
to a steering lock device, it is further necessary to develop the technology concerned.
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to eliminate the aforementioned
disadvantage and to provide a steering lock device with a key cylinder which is capable of
freely rotating without fail in case of an unauthorised attempt to unlock.Accordingly the present invention provides a
