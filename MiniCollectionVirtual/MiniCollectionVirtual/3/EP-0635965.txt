<ABSTRACT>
A technique for downloading or activating or deactivating selected machine 
features (Figs 3-8) from a remote central station (157) that is connected to the remote 

machine (30) by a communication channel (175). Also, the invention includes identifying 
(Fig.9) features to be downloaded and then activated at a given site and communicating 

the data relative to the identified features to the remote machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system tor the selective enablement of machine
features and more particularly, to the selective enablement of machine features from a
remote station over a common communication channel.A significant consideration in the use of an imaging machine is that some
features of the machine may not be appropriate to every location or machine
environment. In addition operator experience and the mix of job requirements may or may
not preclude the use of selected machine features. Yet, it is impractical to tailor a machine
configuration specifically for each distinct machine location. As a result, a machine
generally is designed or embedded with a multitude of features that may or may not be
applicable at certain locations. For example, features such as Document Editing, Set
Addressing, Poster Enlargement, Irregular Enlargement, Auto Center, Mirror Image,
Freehand editing, Merge Image, User Registered Colors, Bi-directional image shift, Book
Copying or even Expanded Finishing capability may not always be required by the
customer For customer relations, it is preferable, to charge a customer only for features
that are applicable to the specific customer requirements. Yet, the machine often already
possesses these features or such features may be requested at a later date.To overcome the above identified difficulties, it would be desirable to
provide a more flexible and adaptable machine, in particular, a more flexible and
adaptable machine that selectively provides features commensurate with specific
locations and customer requirements.It is known in the prior art for screen dialogues related to features embedded
in a machine to be selectively installed in the machine from a a portable memory device to
enable the features for operator use.. An operator loads the portable memory device into
the machine for reading by the machine control and a special dialog frame on the
interface screen is displayed prompting the operator to confirm the installation of selected
screen dialogues. The selected screen dialogues are automatically set in the control NVM
to establish the selected screen dialog within the machine It is also known to be able to
enable various software packages in a machine control by making appropriate entries in
non volatile memoryThe difficulty with the prior art, however, is the required intervention of an
operator or service representative to load and install the feature and to make the 
appropriate changes in the non volatile memory to reconfigure the machine. This also

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in an imaging system for producing images of documents on
image supporting substrates, the system including a machine (30) having a

plurality of operating components and a central station (157) remote from the
machine, the machine and the central station being interconnected by a

communication channel (175), the machine having a plurality of predetermined

editing features available to a machine operator for activating or
deactivating a selected one of said editing features, resulting in a changed machine

configuration with an increased number of activated editing features or a
decreased number of activated editing features, respectively,
characterized in that

said method includes the steps of

identifying (302-308) the machine at the central station for having said selected
editing feature enabled or disabled,
communicating (310) with the machine over the communication channel
interconnecting the machine and the central station,
responding (312) at the machine that enabling or disabling of said selected
editing feature is a valid editing feature configuration for said machine,
enabling or disabling from the central station said selected editing feature for
the machine, and 

recording (316) in memory the activation or deactivation of said selected
feature.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said machine (30) further comprises an
operator interface (36),

and wherein said method further includes the step of

identifying (310) at said operator interface said selected feature to be
enabled or disabled.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the step of identifying (310) at said
operator interface said selected feature to be enabled or disabled includes the

steps of

accessing (302-208) the central station from the interface,
displaying editing feature options at the interface, the editing features providing
changes of the original document to the images on the supporting substrates,
selecting (310) a given editing feature option.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step (302-308) of identifying the machine at
the central station for having said selected feature enabled or disabled includes

the step (302) of entering a features enabling mode.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step (316) of recording in memory the
activation or deactivation of said selected feature includes the steps of

recording in a central station memory.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step (316) of recording in memory the
activation or deactivation of said selected feature includes the step of recording

in a machine memory, the machine memory preferably being non-volatile
memory. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of communicating with the machine
over the communication channel includes the step of logging on the

communication channel with a password.
