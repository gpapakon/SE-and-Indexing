<ABSTRACT>
A method providing a rolling mill with compensation for 
changes occurring in rolling parameters that result from changes 

occurring in mill speed. The rolling parameters are under 
control of actuators that are connected to receive control 

reference voltages from electrical controllers. The method 
includes the step of generating a compensation function that 

describes the actuator movement required to maintain a rolling 
parameter at a desired level as a function of mill speed. This 

compensation function is used during mill speed changes to 
calculate a compensation value change for each actuator, a change 

that is required to maintain the parameter at the desired level. 
The compensation value change is added to a current level of the 

compensation value to provide a new, updated compensation value. 
The updated value is converted to a voltage for control of the 

actuator, and the voltage is added to the reference voltage of an 
associated electrical controller to provide a total voltage 

reference for the actuator. The total voltage reference is 
effective to substantially eliminate the occurrence of error in 

the controlling process caused by a change in mill speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the control
of rolling mills and particularly to mill controls that
compensate for changes occurring in rolling parameters that
result from changes occurring in mill speed.Changes in the rate of which a rolling mill reduces the
thickness of a material directed through the mill, such as occurs
when a mill is accelerated or decelerated, causes significant
changes in the parameters of the rolling process, for reasons
explained below. These parameters include the force at which
mill rolls engage material in the roll bite of the mill, the
friction in the roll bite, the torque at which the rolls direct
the material through the roll bite, etc. Changes in such rolling
parameters hamper the ability of the mill to produce consistent
sheet thickness and flatness, which are quality concerns and thus
the concern of the producer for his customers.Generally, desired product quality is maintained by the
use of reference values that are supplied to all mill actuators
that control rolling parameters. These parameters include
relative mill speed, average gap sizes, gap size differentials,
average roll bending pressures, and differential roll bending
pressures. The reference values, when properly set and adjusted,
generally maintain desired product quality throughout small
changes in mill speed. Traditionally, closed loop, feedback control
systems measure quality parameters, such as thickness
and flatness downstream from the location of the roll
gap where thickness and flatness disturbance are
created. A required change in actuator setting is
then calculated, and appropriate reference signals
supplied to the respective actuators to correct
thickness and flatness disturbances after the fact.
Such adjustments are capable only of reducing, but
not eliminating, parameter disturbances because of the
delay in making corrections. Patents disclosing such
closed loop, feedback control systems include United
States Patents 4,907,433 to Larson et al., and
3,642,325 to Arimura et al. The delay problem can be
solved by using open loop, feed-forward techniques,
but these depend upon very accurate on-line mill
models. Such models are expensive and require significant
computational power. Further, mill conditions
are not easily predicted and vary slowly over
time. These aspects of rolling have not to date been
accurately modeled yet they are associated with significant
variations in critical rolling parameters as
a result of mill speed changes. As a compromise, the
rate of mill acceleration or

A method of providing a rolling mill with
compensation functions for changes occurring in rolling

parameters that result from changes occurring in mill
speed, said mill having a control system that automatically

maintains the compensation functions updated regardless of
changing conditions occurring in the mill, the compensation

functions describing required movements for actuators (28,3-0,42)
connected to receive control voltages from the outputs

of electrical controllers (18,32,44) of said control
system, characterized in that the steps are:


generating compensation functions that describe
actuator movements as a function of the mill speed required

to maintain rolling parameters at desired levels by sampling
controller output voltages during changes in mill

speed and developing therefrom a piecewise linear curve fit
of controller output versus mill speed, the piecewise

linear curve fit being described by linear coefficients or
slope values of linear curves representing speed change

segments;
multiplying said coefficients by an adaption gain
factor to provide a fraction of each coefficient;
adding said fraction of each coefficient to the
coefficient that is current to provide updated coefficients

that reflect current mill conditions; and
using said updated coefficients in conjunction
with a change in mill speed to calculate the actuator

movements required to maintain the rolling parameters at
desired levels.
A method of providing a compensation function for
at least one control system of a rolling mill, and for

automatically maintaining the compensation function updated
regardless of changing conditions in the mill, said mill

including at least one actuator (28,30,42) under the control
of an electrical controller (18,32,44) for controlling

at least one rolling parameter, characterized in that the
steps are: 


sampling controller output error values during
changes in mill speed, said error values being the differences

occurring between a reference value that is set
for the controller (18,32,44) and a feedback signal representing

the rolling parameter;
averaging the sampled error over predetermined
speed change intervals to provide an average of controller

error values during an occurrence of mill speed changes;
multiplying said error values by an adaption gain
factor to provide fractions of the averaged error values;
adding said fractions to current values of linear
coefficients of required actuator movement versus speed

function to provide updated coefficients reflecting conditions

using said updated coefficients in conjunction
with a mill speed change value for the calculation of the

actuator movement required to maintain the rolling parameters
at desired levels.
