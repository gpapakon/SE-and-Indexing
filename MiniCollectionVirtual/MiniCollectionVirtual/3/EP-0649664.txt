<ABSTRACT>
A hanger strap (30;130) has a connection portion 
(40;140) which, in use, is connected to a component (12), 

particularly part of a medical fluid administration kit, 
which provides a narrow-mouthed slot (22). An elongate 

strap body extends from the connection portion and has a 
wide portion (36), a narrow portion (32) and a hanging 

means (31) (usually a loop). For storage, the strap lies 
flat against the component. For use, the strap is bent up 

and its narrow portion (32) is passed into the slot through 
the mouth. The strap is pulled through the slot until the 

wide portion (36) is therein. This cannot escape through 
the mouth, and formations (34,38;138) (e.g. ratchet teeth) 

resist its withdrawal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hanger strap, and 
to an article including such a strap (either as an integral 
part or as a connectable component). It is particularly 
concerned with the field of medical products, especially 
products that have to be produced and packaged in a sterile 
form, such as components used in the administration of 
medical fluids (such as blood, blood components and drugs 
for intravenous administration). It is known (for example from EP-A-0,285,424) to 
provide apparatus for administering a voluminous liquid 
component in which a second component (usually solid) is 
dissolved. The apparatus includes a flexible container of 
liquid, and a cup which is coupled, or can be coupled, to 
the container. A tubular spike extends through the base of 
the cup into the interior. It is communicable with the 
interior of the flexible container. In use, a vial 
containing the solid component is pushed onto the spike, so 
that liquid from the container can enter the vial and be 
returned to the container, which thus contains a solution 
of the solid. It is normally then desired for the assembly 
to be suspended, with the cup and vial above the container, 
so that the solution can be dispensed from the container in 
a downward direction. EP-A-0,285,424 is concerned with 
systems in which the vial is trapped in the cup (once it 
has been penetrated by the spike) by a further cup-like  
 
component which is inverted, and forms a sealed enclosure 
with the cup. This component can provide, on its base, an 
aperture by which the assembly can be suspended. However, 
we have now developed systems in which there is no need for 
the additional cup. Therefore there is a problem as to how 
the assembly can be conveniently suspended. It is, of 
course, very important that the various components should 
be packaged and stored hygienically. As one part of this, 
it is desirable for the cup member to have its mouth sealed 
by a diaphragm which is peeled away immediately prior to 
the use. Therefore the peripheral end face of the cup wall 
cannot conveniently carry hanger means. Since such 
products would also generally be over-wrapped, it is also 
very desirable that all components should pack neatly and 
not occupy large amounts of space. In one aspect, the present invention provides a 
hangable assembly comprising a component having a body and 
an upper flange portion having a narrow-mouthed slot; and 
an elongate hanger strap having a flexible strap body 
terminating at one end in an enlargement
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hangable assembly comprising a component 
(12;112) having a body with a web portion (18;118) which 

defines a narrow-mouthed slot (22;122); and an elongate 
hanger strap (30;130) having: a connection portion (40;140) 

at one end by which it is connected or connectable to the 

component; hanging means (31;131) at the other end; and a 
flexible strap body connecting the connection portion to 

the hanging means, said strap body having a narrow portion 
(32;132) adjacent the hanging means and a wider portion 

(36;136) remoter from the hanging means, the wider portion 
(36;136) being accommodatable within the narrow-mouthed 

slot but not readily passable through the mouth, whereas 
the narrow portion is readily passable through the slot's 

mouth. 
An assembly according to claim 1 wherein the 
strap body has engagement formations such that if the 

narrow portion is passed into the slot and the strap body 
is then displaced relative to the slot so that the wider 

portion extends through the slot, the engagement formations 
engage the web portion to resist withdrawal. 
An assembly according to claim 2 wherein the 
engagement formations comprise a tapered region of the 

strap which is adapted to wedge in the slot. 
An assembly according to claim 2 or claim 3 
wherein the engagement formations comprise projections on 

 
the strap body. 
An assembly according to claim 4 wherein the 
projections are shaped so that the portion of the strap 

body bearing them can be pulled through the slot in the 
direction with the hanging means leading, but passage in 

the other direction is more strongly resisted. 
An assembly according to claim 5 wherein the 
projections are ratchet teeth projecting from one face of 

the strap body. 
An assembly according to any preceding claim 
wherein the connection portion of the hanger strap provides 

plug means and the component body has a complementary 
socket means. 
An assembly according to any preceding claim 
wherein the component comprises a cup member of a medical 

administration apparatus, said cup member having a base, a 
tubular spike extending through the base, a cylindrical cup 

wall rising from the base, and a peripheral flange 
extending outwardly from an upper region of the cup wall; 

said flange providing the web portion in which the slot is 
defined. 
An assembly according to claim 8 wherein the 
strap body is connected to the cup wall beneath the region 

of the flange having the slot, and extends downwardly away 
from the flange until forcibly bent upwardly against its 

own resilience. 
A hanger strap for use in an assembly according 
to any preceding claim.
