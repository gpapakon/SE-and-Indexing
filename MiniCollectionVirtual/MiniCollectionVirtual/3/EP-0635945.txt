<ABSTRACT>
Pulse signals indicating up or down of a time constant are 
received and counted. When a time-out occurs, a time 

constant change signal is output. At up counting, when input 
signal is low, the flip-flop 80 of each bit is forcibly set 

to 1. Then, an up counter consisting of the high-order two 
bits (control bits) is provided. A time constant of a 

variable integrator is changed in response to output of the 
high-order two bits, so that the time constant can be changed 

rapidly. On the other hand, if the input signal is high, a 
5-bit down counter is provided. Thus, the time constant of 

the variable integrator can be changed gently.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an A/D converter for use with
a delay circuit and more particularly to an A/D converter
containing a variable integrator whose time constant is
changed.Hitherto, a surround sound of an audio machine has been
produced by delaying a reproduced sound for a predetermined
time, attenuating, and superposing the resulting sound. Such
reproduction modes as a stadium mode and a church mode are
available for delaying and superposing reproduced sounds by
different techniques.One of the delay circuits used for such purposes is
shown in Figure 1. In the circuit, an analog reproduction
signal is temporarily converted into digital data by an A/D
converter 10 and the digital data is stored in a memory 12.
The data read from the memory 12 is converted back into
analog data by a D/A converter 14. In the circuit, the write
time into and read time out of the memory 12 are varied and
the difference therebetween becomes a delay time. Used as the A/D converter 10 is one as shown in Figure
2. The A/D converter 10 comprises an adder 20, a quantizer
22, a variable integrator 24, and a control section 26; an
analog output of the variable integrator 24 is fed back into
the adder 20 to which an analog signal is input. The
quantizer 22 comprises a comparator 22a which outputs high or
low in response to input signal voltage and a latch circuit
22b which latches the output of the comparator 22a in
response to a predetermined clock for converting an input
signal into a 1-bit digital signal. The variable integrator
24 integrates outputs of the quantizer 22 for providing an
analog signal corresponding to the input signal. The output
of the variable integrator 24 is fed back into the adder 20,
which then finds a difference between both the signals; for
the input signal with no change, the quantizer 22 outputs
high and low, namely, "1" and "0" alternately.On the other hand, the control section 26 changes a
time constant in the variable integrator 24 in response to
the output state of the quantizer 22. That is, if the output
level of the adder 20 is large and the quantizer 22 makes an
unbalanced output between "0" and "1," the time constant of
the variable integrator 24 is made small; if the output level
of the adder 20 is small and the quantizer 22 outputs "0" and
"1" keeping a balance therebetween, the time constant of the 
variable integrator 24 is made large. Under such control,
when there is silence, the time constant can be made large to
suppress occurrence of high-frequency noise; when the input
signal
