<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multi-layer product, in 
particular for producing containers, comprising a 

layer (1) formed of a fiber-based packing material on 
one surface of which a gas-tight multi-layer plastic 

coating (3) is arranged. To prevent the formation of 
microholes, the gas-tight multi-layer plastic coating 

(3) is formed of superposed 1-4 g/m² barrier plastic 
layer (4a,4b,4c,4d,4e), 1-4 g/m² binder layer (5), and 

surface layer (6) of a heat-sealable polyolefin material 
having sufficient thickness for liquid-tight heat 

sealing, so that the barrier plastic layer is the 
closest of said layers to the fiber-based packing 

material layer (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-layer product,
in particular for producing containers, comprising a
layer formed of a fiber-based packing material on one
surface of which a gas-tight multi-layer plastic coating is
arranged.Multi-layer products of the above type are today
very well known for example in connection with containers
for citrus fruit juices. Frequently, the fiber-based
material is cardboard. The solution disclosed in EP-A2-0
293 098 is one example of the prior art solutions.Another example is disclosed in WO-A-92 04187.
This discloses a paper cover for forming a food product
container. The paper cover has a multi-layered plastics
coating comprising a polymer bonding layer, a polymer
layer of oxygen impermeable material, another polymer
bonding layer and heat sealable polymer layer. The purpose
of the oxygen impermeable layer is to prevent the
penetration of oxygen from the ambient atmosphere
into the container which might cause deterioration of
food products contained in the container.In connection with the prior art solutions, problems
have been encountered in the manufacturing step of
containers, particularly in heat sealing the plastic surfaces
together, wherein pinholes may be induced in the
multi-layer plastic coating. Pinholing presents a particular
problem when the holes are produced on the inner
surface of the container. The good gas-tightness characteristics
of the plastic coating are in that case partly
lost, since gas flow may even occur through microholes,
even though despite the microholes the coating were
liquid-tight.Pinholing of the plastic coating is a result of, among
other things, the fact that the high temperature applied
to the coating in heat sealing softens and partly melts
the plastic layers. A further reason for pinholing is that
also the cardboard is heated in the sealing region, and
on account of steam pressure the moisture in the card-board
tends to penetrate the softened and partly molten
plastic layers, thus producing pinholes in the coating.
The fact is that the higher the heat sealing temperature
and the higher the moisture content in the cardboard,
the more readily pinholes will be induced. The steam
pressure in the cardboard tends to burst, spot-wise at
small points, the plastic layer applied to the cardboard.
The burst point serves as an initiator for pinholing.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
multi-layer product wherewith the drawbacks of the prior
art can be eliminated. It has been found in connection
with the invention that
