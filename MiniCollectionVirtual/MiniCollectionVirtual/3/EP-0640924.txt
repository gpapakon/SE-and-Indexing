<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a data reproducing 
apparatus, and more particularly to an improvement of 
optical disc device which is utilized as an auxiliary 
memory unit for a computer. Heretofore, there is an optical disc device which 
is used as an auxiliary memory unit for a computer, 
etc.. In this optical disc device, there are optical 
disc devices for reproducing only which uses unwritable 
optical disc, an optical disc device which uses 
writable optical disc, for example, magnetic optical 
disc, and the like. In this type of optical disc device, the content 
of an optical disc can be copied easily. Thus, a 
problem occurs regarding the protection of a copyright 
recently. Also, data representing the data structure of  
 
disc, DDS (Disc Definition Structure), is recorded in 
the optical disc. For example, the information of 
sector interchange-processed, etc. is recorded in the 
DDS. The DDS is so important data as to be recorded 
twice each in the innermost and the outermost of an 
optical disc. If one data becomes impossible to 
correct error, the data structure can be obtained from 
another DDS recorded in another area. However, this DDS is recorded four times and it 
may be insufficient according to the case. That is, 
there is a problem that the optical disc can not be 
used when all DDS become impossible to correct error. In view of the foregoing, an object of this 
invention is to provide a data reproducing apparatus 
for solving the above problems. More specifically, this invention provides a disc 
driving apparatus for driving a disc type recording 
medium on which a vendor unique data which can not be 
output to outside the disc driving apparatus and an 
user data are recorded, comprising: reproducing means 
for reproducing the vendor unique data and the user  
 
data recorded on the disc type recording medium; buffer 
memory means for temporary storing the user data 
reproduced by the reproducing means; interface means 
for outputting the user data to outside the disc 
driving apparatus, identification data storing means 
for storing an identification data which is peculiar to 
the disc driving apparatus; detection means for 
detecting whether or not the vendor unique data 
reproduced by the reproducing means is coincident with 
the identification data; and control means for 
preventing outputting of the user data from the 
interface means when the detection means detects that 
the vender unique data is not coincident with the 
identification data. Further, this invention provides a
