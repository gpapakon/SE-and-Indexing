image forming apparatus wherein the brush charging device 

charges a surface of an image carrier, which has the steps 
of sewing brush fibers on base cloth such that the brush 

fibers are positioned vertically with respect to the base 
cloth, mounting the base cloth with the brush fibers onto a 

support member which has substantially the same curvature as 
that of the forming carrier and linearly cutting the tip of 

the fibers on the base cloth mounted on the support member. 
A brush charging device for an image forming apparatus, 

which charges a surface of an image carrier rotating in a 
predetermined direction, has a linear mount member, a base 

cloth mounted on the mount member and a brush member having 
fibers sewed on the base cloth at an angle ϑ₁, the angle ϑ₁ 

satisfying the following formula: cos ϑ₁ 
>
 c/(a + b) 
wherein a represents the radius of the image carrier, b 

represents the length of the brush fibers and c represents 
the distance between a point of intersection where a 

perpendicular line extending from the center of the image 
carrier to the base cloth intersects the base cloth and an 

edge portion of the base cloth located upstream going in the 
direction of the image carrier and where the brush fibers 

contact the surface of the image carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brush charging 
device for use in an image forming apparatus and to a method 
of manufacturing the brush charging device. In recent years, a contact charging device such as 
a charging brush has been employed in place of a corona 
charger. The charging brush does not produce a large amount 
of ozone. However, when such a charging brush is used for 
copying machines and printers especially electronic 
photocopying apparatus employing a reverse developing 
method, a number of lines are produced on the printing 
surface during the printing of half tones as if drawn by a 
paint brush. In an electronic photo-copying apparatus 
employing the reversed developing based on negative charges, 
such lines appear as white lines. This means that the 
surface potential of the photo-sensitive drum is locally 
higher on the negative side. These uneven lines are 
peculiar to the brush, especially remarkable in a fixed type 
conductive brush. Furthermore, a charging brush whose 
surface has substantially the same curvature as that of the 
photo-sensitive drum surface should be used so that the tip 
of the brush uniformly contacts the photo-sensitive drum 
surface as disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure (kokai) 
No. 210862/88. But no appropriate method has been known for  
 
mass-producing such brushes. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
method for manufacturing a fixed type conductive brush which 
uniformly charges the surface potential of a photo-sensitive 
drum or the like. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
charging device having a fixed type conductive brush which 
uniformly charges the surface potential of a photo-sensitive 
drum surface or the like. According to a first aspect of the invention a 
brush charging device for charging a surface of an 
electrostatic image carrier wherein the brush charging 
device comprises
 
   a linear mounting member, a base member 
mounted on the mounting member, and a brush member having 
fibres secured to the base member, said fibres being 
inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to the base 
member. According to a second aspect of the invention a 
method of manufacturing a brush charging device for charging 
a surface of an electrostatic image carrier
 
   comprises the steps of securing brush fibres to a 
base member such that the fibres are positioned 
vertically with respect to the base member;
 
 
   mounting the base member onto a support member 
which has substantially the same curvature as that of
