<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a polymer having hydroxyl groups at both terminals from a wide variety of vinyl 
monomers including polar ones readily at a low cost and good efficiency. The process comprises polymerizing a vinyl 

monomer (a) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (b) by using also a hydrogen peroxide decomposition promoter 
(c) and/or an amphophilic compound (d) substantially without using any component other than the components (a) 

through (d).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a useful polymer having a hydroxyl group at both
terminals capable of reacting with various kinds of
functional groups.A polymer having a hydroxyl group at both terminals
is able to easily convert the hydroxyl group into other
functional groups by carrying out a suitable reaction on the
terminal hydroxyl group, and also, the polymer itself
converts into a macromolecule and/or a network molecule by
using reactivity of the terminal hydroxyl group and carrying
out a suitable reaction on this hydroxyl group and, as a
result, the polymer becomes a high-molecular compound having
excellence in various properties such as strength, heat
resistance, weather resistance, durability and so forth.This polymer having a hydroxyl group at both
terminals has, for example, the following great advantages
by displaying a feature such as having a hydroxyl group at
both terminals.In a case where the polymer is used as a raw
material (for example a crosslinking agent) for various
kinds of resins such as a polyester resin, a polyurethane 
resin and a polycarbonate resin, since there is
not any unreacted component spoiling physical properties of
a material, all polymers are surely assembled in a resin-crosslinked
structure.A polymer in which a functional group has been
introduced into a side chain by copolymerizing a vinyl-based
monomer having a functional group such as a hydroxyl
group, a carboxyl group, an amino group, a polymerizable
unsaturated group (hereinafter, abbreviated as
"a copolymer of a functional group-containing vinyl-based
monomer"); when said polymer is used for a reaction, its
terminal becomes a play part (a free terminal) which is not
assembled in the resin (-crosslinked) structure, but such a
thing does not occur in a polymer having a hydroxyl group
at both terminals.Compared with the copolymer of a functional group-containing
vinyl-based monomer, because scattering in the
distance between the functional groups is very small, the
distance between reacting sites (crosslinking sites) is
nearly constant, so that a homogeneous resin (-crosslinked)
structure is made.In a case of a copolymer of a functional group-containing
vinyl-based monomer, even if the synthesis of a
thermoplastic polymer is attempted by making a material of
2.0 in the average number of functional groups and by 
allowing this to react with a chain-elongating agent having
two functionalities, since a polymer having three or more
functionalities is statistically included because of a
reason
