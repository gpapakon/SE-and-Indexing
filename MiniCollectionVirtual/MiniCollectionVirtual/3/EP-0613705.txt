<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller skate with a 
braking device whereby a shoe is composed of 
a quarter articulated to a shell which is in turn associated 
with a supporting frame for two or more wheels. Currently, in conventional roller skates, whether 
constituted by a shoe associated with a support for two 
pairs of mutually parallel wheels or by a shoe associated 
with a supporting frame for two or more in-line wheels, 
there is the problem of braking said wheels to adjust the 
speed of the skate. It is known to use adapted blocks or pads, usually made 
of rubber, which are arranged at the toe or heel region of 
the shoe. When the user tilts the shoe forwards or 
backwards, the free end of the blocks or pads interacts with 
the ground and braking is thus achieved. However, the operation of conventional brakes is not 
satisfactory because they require the user to rotate the 
shoe, and thus the frame associated therewith, at the toe or 
heel, and this can cause loss of balance with consequent 
falls. US Patent No. 1,402,010 dicloses a roller skate having 
a strap that can be secured on the user's leg above the 
malleolar region, a rod being connected to the strap. The rod surrounds the leg to the rear and is then 
curved so as to laterally affect the leg until it is 
associated at its ends, in the malleolar region, with a 
lever system which is articulated to a structure protruding 
from the wheel supporting frame. The lever system protrudes to the rear of the frame and  
 
is connected to a plate which is shaped approximately 
complementarily to the curvature of part of an underlying 
and facing wheel. This solution is not free from drawbacks: first of all, 
a relative movement between the strap and the leg is 
produced during sports practice, and this does not make its 
use comfortable due to the continuous rubbing of the strap 
on the leg. Furthermore, the plate is activated every time the user 
bends his leg backwards beyond a given angle, with no true 
and easy possibilities to vary this condition. Since the shape of the leg is different for each user 
for the same rod length there is a different braking action 
at different rotation angles. Furthermore, the rod acts and presses in the malleolar 
region, and this can cause discomfort or accidental impacts. 
Finally, the wheel wears out considerably. US patent No. 4,275,895 provides a partial solution to 
this drawback, and illustrates a brake for skates with two 
pairs of mutually parallel wheels which acts at the rear 
wheels. The brake

A roller skate comprising a shoe composed of a 
quarter (4,104,204) articulated to a shell (5,105,205) 

associated with a supporting frame (6,106,206) for a 
plurality of wheels (7), and a braking device including a 

brake member associated with said quarter, said brake member 
selectively interacting with the ground upon a backward 

rotation of said quarter, said brake member comprising: an 
elongated body (10,110,210); a pair of lateral wings 

(12a,12b,112a,112b,212) protruding from said body and being 
connected at opposite sides to said quarter; and a braking 

pad (11,111,211) connected with said body and suitable to 
interact with the ground. 
The roller skate of claim 1, characterized in that 
said body (10,110,210) is curved and is arranged to the rear 

of said shell (5,105,205) and said frame (6,106,206). 
The roller skate of any one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said lateral wings 

can be moved mutually apart elastically and have cylindrical 
pins (13) at their ends. 
The roller skate of any one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the distance between said pair 

of wings is approximately equal to the width of said quarter 
(4), said wings being arranged laterally to said quarter and 

to said shell. 
The roller skate of claim 3, characterized in that 
said wings are rotatably associated with said quarter by 

means of the insertion of said cylindrical pins (13) within 
adapted first seats (14) which are formed axially with 

respect to a stem of a pair of studs (15,215) for the  
 

pivoting of said shell (5,205) and said quarter (4,204) and 
rotate rigidly with said quarter. 
The roller skate of claim 5, characterized in that a 
second seat (17,217) is formed on the head of each one of 

said studs (15,215) by removing material for part of its 
thickness so as to form two radial walls (18a,18b, 

218a,218b) between which the ends of said lateral wings are 
arranged by abutment. 
The roller skate of claim 6, characterized in that 
said brake is kept in neutral position, and thus 

approximately with said pad raised from the ground, by means 
of an elastically deformable element (219). 
The roller skate of claim 7, characterized in that 
said elastically deformable element is constituted by at 

least one spring (219) which is associated with said shell 
(205) and said body (210) of said brake at its ends. 
The roller skate of any one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said brake and said quarter, 

during normal skating, can oscillate freely with respect to 
said shell, said pad (11,111,211) remaining raised from the 

ground. 
The roller skate of claim 9, characterized in that 
the shape of said lateral wings (12a,12b) and said body and 

the angle formed between said second seats (17) and the 
ground are such that the rotation of said quarter and said 

studs during normal skating does not make said pad (11) 
interact with the ground. 
The roller skate of claim 10, characterized in that 
beyond a given angle of backward rotation of said quarter 

(4), said pad (11) of said brake interacts with the ground.

preceding claims 1 to 2, 4, and 9 to 11, characterized in 

that said lateral wings (112a,112b) are rigidly associated 
with said quarter (104) and protrude laterally and below the 

lower perimetric edge (120) of said quarter (104). 
The roller skate of any one or more of claims 5 to 
8, characterized in that second seats (217) are formed on 

said head of each one of said studs (215) by removing 
material for part of its thickness, so as to form two radial 

walls (218a, 218b) between which an acute angle is formed 
that is larger than the thickness of said pins of said 

lateral wings of said body of said brake. 
The roller skate of claim 13, characterized in that 
when the quarter is upright, said pins of said lateral wings 

(212) interact by abutment with said radial walls

backward rotation of said quarter. 
The roller skate of claim 14, characterized in that 
an elastically deformable element, such as a spring (219)

from the ground when the quarter (204) is upright, is 

interposed between said body of said brake member and said 
shell. 
The roller skate of claim 15, characterized in that 
interaction of said brake member with the ground and forward 

rotation of said quarter are followed by the lifting of said 
brake performed by said elastically deformable element 

(219). 
The roller skate of claim 16, characterized in that  
 

said angle of backward rotation of said quarter (204) that 
activates said brake member can be modified by varying the 

mutual position of each one of said studs (215) and said
