<ABSTRACT>
Transdermal polymer dosage units are provided which comprise a backing layer and a reservoir layer. The reservoir layer can have multiple regions which contact the skin during use, optionally may have different pharmaceuticals, may provide variable rate of transdermal absorption, and may provide the pharmaceuticals in the form of microreservoirs or one or more macroreservoirs. The reservoir region can comprise a macroreservoir of one or more pharmaceuticals wherein the reservoir is bounded by a backing layer and a layer of a substantially non-porous permeability-regulating polymer membrane which directly or indirectly contacts the skin during transdermal administration. Also, provided is a process of transdermal administration of pharmaceuticals using the novel dosage units.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRANSDERMAL CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF PHARMACEUTICALS AT VARIABLE DOSAGE RATES AND PROCESSESTECHNICAL FIELD A novel transdermal absorption dosage unit by which multiple pharmaceuticals can be provided for transdermal absorption simultaneously at different or variable dosage rates and at relatively constant permeation profiles. The dosage units can provide the desired differences or varia- tion in the dosage rates by providing multiregional areas of the dosage unit which have different compositions with respect to the pharmaceuticals. The novel dosage units of this invention can also provide controlled and variable dosage rates of two or more pharmaceuticals on a simul- taneous basis from a single reservoir area. A single dosage area can comprise a reservoir in which the pharmaceuticals are in liquid state and are contained by a permeability- regulating membrane, which can come in contact either directly or indirectly with the skin of the subject being treated. The pharmaceuticals administered by the dosage unit of this invention can vary widely. Additionally, this invention relates to an improved process for transdermal systemic delivery of pharmaceuticals. 

BACKGROUND ARTIt has been found that certain pharmaceuticals ar absorbed to a degree through the skin. This is referred t as transdermal absorption. One means of transdermal absorp tion has been to disperse the pharmaceutical within a poly meric disc or a container of a gel and then contacting a area of the skin of the subject to be treated with the dis or gel containing the pharmaceutical. Problems encountere in the past include adequate control over the rate and dura tion of transdermal absorption or the rate can be too slo in the case of certain dosage forms, especially from pharma ceutical-containing discs or pharmaceutical-containing ge container dosage units. It has been found that the trans dermal absorption rates of certain pharmaceuticals can b increased by coadministering one or more transdermal absorp tion-enhancing agents with the pharmaceutical to be absorbe when compounding the polymeric disc or the pharmaceutical containing gel.It is desired to improve the dosage unit forms o devices by which pharmaceuticals are transdermally absorbed, especially in view of the importance of administering phar maceuticals by this means. Desired transdermal absorptio of pharmaceuticals would provide an avoidance of gastro intestinal incompatibility with the pharmaceuticals an unwanted destruction of the pharmaceuticals by metabolism i the

What is Claimed is:
1. A transdermal dosage unit comprising: a. a backing layer which is impervious to the ingre¬ dients of the dosage unit; b. a reservoir layer which has a reservoir region in which there is dissolved in a liquid medium for transdermal absorption one or more pharmaceuticals which are present therein in the form of micro¬ reservoirs or a macroreservoir; c. the absorption rate of said one or more pharma- ceuticals being substantially constant for at least 24 hours and providing by transdermal absorption effective amounts thereof; d. said reservoir region having an outer wall being a permeability-regulating polymer membrane which is substantially non-porous and which provides said substantially constant rate of transdermal absorp- tion of said one or more pharmaceuticals; and e. said dosage unit adapted to adhere to a subject using said dosage unit.
2. A dosage unit of Claim 1 wherein the reservoir region has said pharmaceuticals present in the form of a macroreservoir region.
3. A dosage unit of Claim 2 wherein the reservoir layer has an adhesive region which is separate from said macroreservoir region. 


4. A dosage unit of Claim 3 wherein the macroreservoir region has applied thereto an adhesive layer adapted to adhere said dosage unit to said subject.
5. A dosage unit of Claim 1 wherein said reservoir region said pharmaceuticals present in the form of micro¬ reservoirs.
6. A dosage unit of Claim 5 which further comprises a second region which provides adhesion to said subject.
7. A dosage unit of Claim 1 wherein said reservoir region has an adhesive region which is separate from said reservoir region and has a pharmaceutical dispersed therein in the form of microreservoirs.
8. A dosage unit of Claim 1 wherein said liquid medium is a biocompatible combination of miscible solvents.
9. A dosage unit of Claim 8 wherein one of said solvents is water.
10. A dosage unit of Claim 8 wherein the combination of miscible solvents comprise water and ethyl alcohol.
11. A dosage unit of Claim 1 wherein said liquid medium comprises a C

 alkane diol.
12. A dosage unit of Claim 2 wherein the solvent is propylene glycol. 


13. A transdermal dosage unit comprising: a. a backing layer which is impervious to the ingredients of the dosage unit; b. a reservoir layer which is attached to said back- ing layer which has multiple regions, at least two of which in use contact the skin of a subject using said dosage unit, and provide transdermal absorption of one or more pharmaceuticals simul¬ taneously.
14. A dosage unit of Claim 2, 5 or 13 wherein said pharma¬ ceuticals are selected from hormonal steroids or com- binations thereof.
15. A dosage unit of Claim 2 wherein at least one of said pharmaceuticals is 17-beta-estradiol.
