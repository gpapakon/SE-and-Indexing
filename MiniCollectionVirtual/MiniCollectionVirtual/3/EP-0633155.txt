<ABSTRACT>
A control is described for the drive train of a motor vehicle with an internal combustion engine, an automatic gearbox, e.g. an automatic mechanical gearbox with electronically controlled mechanical dry clutch, and with an accelerator pedal (13) to which a set value transmitter is assigned, accelerator pedal movement processes being monitored and analyzed with respect to engine power control and gear-shifting processes using a computer (4) and gear-shifting processes being initiated on the basis of stored engine characteristic diagrams and shift characteristic curves and operating parameters which are detected by sensors, and power thresholds (H) being selectively produced on the accelerator pedal travel (S) using the computer (4) and a friction disc; in order to reduce gear-shifting processes, the combustion engine is adjusted correctively with respect to the accelerator pedal position (S) to the engine torque (Mmax) which is the maximum possible one at the respective engine rpm (D), using the computer (4), in each case before a change-down process or a power threshold on the accelerator pedal travel is reached, the torque increase (brought about correctively) along the accelerator pedal travel (S) being brought about continuously up to the respective change-down point or up to the respective power threshold (H).

A method of controlling a drive train of a motor vehicle
equipped with an internal combustion engine, an automatic

transmission, e.g. an automatic gear shifting mechanism with an
electronically controlled mechanical dry clutch, and an

accelerator pedal (13) with an associated set value transmitter,
in which method


accelerator pedal motion sequences are monitored and analysed
as regards engine power control and gear shifting procedures by

aid of a computer (4),
gear shifting procedures are triggered on the basis of stored
engine characteristics and gear shifting characteristics as well

as on the basis of operational parameters detected by sensors,
and
force thresholds (H) are selectively produced along the
accelerator pedal path (S) by aid of the computer (4) so as to

obtain indications for the driver with a view to consumption
optimization, characterised in that
before a downshifting procedure or a force threshold on the
accelerator pedal path, respectively, is reached, the internal

combustion engine is driven under the control of the computer
(4), correctingly to the accelerator pedal position (S), to the

maximum engine torque (M
max
) possible at the respective number
of engine revolutions (D),
the torque increase correctingly caused by the computer (4)
occurring continuously along the accelerator pedal path (S) as

far as to the respective downshifting point or as far as to the
respective force threshold (H), respectively.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that after
each downshifting procedure triggered by overcoming a force

threshold on the accelerator pedal path, after each upshifting
procedure during an accelerating procedure, as well as at the

first accelerator pedal rest point after a pedal zero
positioning, if a pre-determined minimum driving speed, e.g. 16

km/h, is exceeded, the internal combustion engine at first is
driven to a comsumption-optimum torque (M
opt
) by aid of the
computer, correctingly to the accelerator pedal position, which 

torque is reduced only after a subsequent pedal release
corresponding to the pedal release path, which torque, however,

at a further stepping on the accelerator pedal as far as to the
next downshifting point or as far as to the force threshold on

the accelerator pedal path, respectively, will be increased to
the maximum torque (M
max
) possible.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
apart from a possible drive slip control intervention, the

torque of the internal combustion engine along the accelerator
pedal path will always be directed at least to a value

corresponding to the relationship

M = M
max
 (S/S
sp
)
a
,

wherein

M
is the engine torque to be approached at at the present
moment;
M
max
is the highest torque possible at that respective moment;
S
is the accelerator pedal path at that respective moment,
S
sp
is the respective accelerator pedal path for triggering a
downshifting procedure; and
a
is a given parameter depending, e.g., on the respective gear
shifted, and amounting to, e.g., 0.5-1.5, preferably

amounting to 1.25.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that during and 1-2 seconds after accelerating

procedures, automatic upshiftings are triggered in accordance
with upshifting characteristics corresponding to economy

shifting characteristics, whereas at constant or decreasing
driving speeds, in case of an accelerator pedal release,

upshiftings are triggered according to upshifting
characteristics that are lower than the economy shifting

characteristics by automatic switching over.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that upshiftings at constant or decreasing

driving speeds, during transverse accelerations of the vehicle
as calculated, e.g., on the basis of information on the number

of wheel revolutions provided by an anti-block system control 
device, and during uphill driving calculated from parameters, or

at increased driving resistances are suppressed.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that upshiftings are suppressed for a certain

time interval after downshifting procedures that have been
triggered by a short pressure on the accelerator pedal, as long

as there is no substantial increase in the number of revolutions
or a zero positioning of the accelerator pedal.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that by aid of the computer force thresholds

are selectively generated along the accelerator pedal path as
inhibiting thresholds so as to keep the internal combustion

engine in the range of high torque or high degree of
effectiveness, respectively.
A method according to claim 7, characterised in that at
each pedal movement departing from the zero position of the

accelerator pedal, at the process of starting and during
driving, by an inhibiting threshold on the accelerator pedal

path that accelerator pedal position is indicated for the
upshifting number of revolutions which will keep the subsequent

accelerating procedure within the optimally effective range of
number of engine revolutions.
A method according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that
by generating inhibiting thresholds on the accelerator pedal

path, at the triggering points for downshifting procedures which
depend on the downshifting characteristics and on the driving

speed or on the number of engine revolutions, respectively,
downshifting procedures not necessarily required are signalled

to the driver so as to keep the internal combustion engine in
the range of optimum effectiveness during the accelerating

phases by positioning the accelerator pedal at the inhibiting
threshold.
A method according to any one of claims 7 to 9,
characterised in that the inhibiting thresholds are produced 

with a friction disk (42) provided in the set value transmitter
of the accelerator pedal by means of an electromagnetic

actuator, an increased moment of friction being generated on the
friction disk if the actuator (18) is operated by the computer

(4).
A method according to claim 10, characterised in that the
friction disk (42) for the inhibiting thresholds is arranged on

a freewheeling device (43) effective during an accelerator pedal
release.
A method according to claim 10 or 11, characterised in
that for transmitting the moment of friction of the friction

disk (42) to the set-value transmitter shaft (44), an elastic
disk coupling (45) is arranged in the set-value transmitter, and

that the inhibiting threshold force on the accelerator pedal
path (S) is set in the computer (4) already a few mm, e.g. 3 to

5 mm, in front of the triggering point for a downshifting
procedure and increases continuously until triggering of the

shifting procedure, the engine torque simultaneously being
increased from the consumption-optimal torque (M
opt
) to the
maximum torque possible (M
max
) by the rotation of the set-value
transmitter shaft.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the automated clutch is disengaged by aid

of the computer (4) at each zero position of the accelerator
pedal, except in case an acceleration of the vehicle occurs or

will occur as pre-calculated from parameters , as well as in
case of actuation of the braking pedal, disengagement of the

clutch, however, being effected immediately after release of the
braking pedal.
