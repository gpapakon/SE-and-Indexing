<ABSTRACT>
The rotary seal, embodying a rotary seal 
ring (11) and a stationary seal ring (42), for a 

centrifugal separator (14) including an imperforate bowl 
(12) has a seal ring hub (10) for supporting the rotary 

seal ring (11). The seal ring hub (10) is formed by an 
annular hub plate (50) defining a central shaft 

receiving opening (51). The plate (50) includes an 
axially extending annular lip (52) on its periphery and 

an axially extending annular rib (54) in spaced 
juxtaposition with the opening (51). A plurality of 

spaced apart chordally extending vanes (56) extend 
between the rib (54) and the lip (52) for stabilizing 

the plate (50) during rotation of the seal and providing 
a flow of cooling air around the rotary seal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rotary seals 
for an imperforate bowl centrifuge. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to a 
rotary seal for a blood processing centrifuge 
separator bowl. Centrifuge bowls with rotary seals are old and 
well known in the art of processing blood. In this 
art, blood is separated into its red cell component 
and plasma component by a centrifuge utilizing an 
imperforate bowl which is rotated about a stationary 
tubular shaft through which whole blood is 
introduced into the bowl and blood fractions, 
particularly plasma and red blood cells are 
sequentially discharged from the bowl. An important 
part of the centrifuge apparatus is the rotary seal 
between the stationary shaft and rotating bowl to 
prevent the leakage of blood components as the bowl 
rotates. U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,214, issued May 26, 1987, 
to G. Reeder, for Method of Washing Red Blood Cells, 
discloses a blood processing centrifuge which 
includes a rotating bowl and a rotary seal between 
the bowl and a stationary shaft. The rotary seal 
includes a rotating seal ring mounted in an annular 
metal plate or hub. The metal plate serves as a 
heat sink to cool the rotating seal ring. U.S. Pat. 
No. 4,300,717, issued November 17, 1981, to 
A. Latham, for Rotary Centrifuge Seal, discloses a  
 
centrifuge bowl and a rotary seal between the bowl 
and a stationary shaft. The rotary seal comprises 
an upper stationary seal ring supported in a metal 
adaptor ring secured to the stationary shaft and a 
lower ceramic rotary seal ring supported in a 
metallic adaptor ring secured to the rotatable 
imperforate centrifuge bowl. In order to conduct 
heat from the seal rings, the patent describes a 
rotary seal ring construction formed of a good heat 
conducting material such as metal which conducts 
heat away from the area of contact between the 
stationary and rotary rings. The use of ports in an 
outer shield to dissipate air currents for cooling 
is described. This patent also discloses the use of 
vanes on the upper external surface of the 
imperforate centrifuge bowl for purposes of 
dissipating heat generated by the seal. Some commercial blood pheresis centrifuge bowls 
and seals utilize a metallic heat sink ring with the 
seal ring, both of which are supported on a plastic 
plate or hub secured to the centrifuge bowl. The principal problems with the foregoing prior 
art devices are a lack of efficient cooling, the 
rotary seal rings tend to chatter, and the 
supporting hubs utilize expensive metals. It
