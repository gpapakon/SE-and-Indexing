<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical fiber gyro, 
and more particularly to, the improvement on response 
speed and measuring precision in an optical fiber gyro 
using a phase modulating method. A first conventional optical fiber gyro comprises 
an optical fiber sensing loop through which 
lights radiated from a laser light source propagate in 
the clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) directions, 
a phase modulator for modulating the light to be 
propagated through the sensing loop, a light detector 
for receiving the light propagated through the sensing 
loop to generate an electric signal, and a signal proc 
essing circuit for processing the electric signal to 
calculate an angular velocity of a rotating member on 
which the sensing loop is mounted. In operation, a light radiated from the laser 
light source is divided into lights to be propagated 
through the sensing loop in the CW and CCW directions. 
Then, the lights propagated through the sensing loop in 
the CW and CCW directions are coupled to be supplied to  
 
the light detector, from which an electric output 
signal corresponding to the received light is supplied 
to the signal processing circuit. In the signal processing circuit, an angular 
velocity of the rotating member is detected in accordance 
with Sagnac phase difference s which is generated 
in the CW and CCW propagating lights by Sagnac effect. 
The Sagnac effect is described in, for instance, the 
USP No. 5,272,516, and the relation between the angular 
velocity Ω and the Sagnac phase difference s is defined 
below. 
Ω = (1/a) s where a is a constant. The output signal supplied from the light detector 
to the signal processing circuit comprises a DC 
(direct current) component, a fundamental wave component, 
a duplicate harmonic wave component, a triplicate 
harmonic wave component, a quadruple harmonic wave 
component, etc. which are defined by output signals 
corresponding to the CW and CCW lights, triangular 
functions of the Sagnac phase difference and the phase 
modulating frequency, and respective orders of Bessel 
functions based on a phase modulating degree. The 
output signal is synchronously detected in the signal 
processing circuit to generate a fundamental wave 
component S₁, a duplicate harmonic wave component  
 
S₂, and a quadruple harmonic wave component S₄. In accordance with the synchronous detection of 
the output signal, the angular velocity is detected as 
explained below.

lights is carried out to make
