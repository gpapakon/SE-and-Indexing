<ABSTRACT>
The agitation mechanism consists of a horizontal plate (6) which can slide flat on a fixed tray (3) via pads (4, 7) having low coefficient of friction, the said plate being driven in an orbital movement by the rotation of a cam (11) and by a guide spindle (5). The fixed tray is associated with a force sensor (2) which weighs the blood bag being filled at regular intervals. Application to sampling blood in a flexible bag.

Device for automatically sampling blood which is collected in a bag
containing an anticoagulant product and resting on a boat member associated

with an agitating mechanism driven in orbital movement through the rotation
of an eccentric part (11) driven by a motor (13), the said agitating mechanism

being constituted by a horizontal plate (6) capable of sliding flat on a fixed
bedplate (3), which is provided with a member (5) for guiding the plate,

characterised in that the eccentric part (11) is located outside the surface
defined by the bedplate (3) and co-operates with a ring (10) connected to the

plate (6), in that the said fixed bedplate (3) is directly associated with a force
meter (2) ensuring the weighing, at regular intervals, of the blood bag in the

process of being filled, and in that the device is equipped with a
microprocessor type programming device.
Sampling device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
member for guiding the bedplate (3) is a vertical pin (5) which passes through

an oblong hole (8) provided in the centre of the plate (6).
Sampling device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
eccentric part is a cam (11) mounted on a shaft (12) of the motor (13), the said

cam being engaged in a ring (10) connected to the plate (6) by an arm (9).
Sampling device according to claim 1, characterised in that the strain
gauge type force meter (2) is placed between a lower bedplate (1), serving as

a base, and the fixed bedplate (3), over which the horizontal plate (6) slides
directly.
Sampling device according to claim 1, characterised in that the fixed
assembly formed by the lower bedplate (1), the force meter (2), the fixed

bedplate (3), with its moving plate (6), as well as a battery (16) and a
microprocessor device (17) are juxtaposed inside one and the same housing

(14) forming the body of the device.
