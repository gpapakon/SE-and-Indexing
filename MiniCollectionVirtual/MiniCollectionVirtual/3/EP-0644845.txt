Demountable side support (side-shoring) for stacks of 
pallets in cold rooms on board ships, characterized in 

that it consists of a wall panel (1) made of sheet metal 
with a stiffening frame (2) disposed on the reverse side, 

and can be fastened, by a vertical plug-in movement, 
horizontally on the floor (3) of the cold room in a 

force-locking manner, with its front side orientated 
parallel to the longitudinal centre of the ship, and can 

also be supported by means of struts (5) which, at one 
end, can be articulated detachably, in the upper half of 

the panel, on the stiffening frame (2) of the latter and, 
at the other end, are articulated on the cold room wall 

(6) of the ship. 
Side support according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the lower angle formed by the struts (5) with the plane 

of the panel wall (1) is selected so as to be greater 
than 90Â° in order, in the event of horizontal loading of 

the panel wall from inside, to produce a vertical 

component from the loading in the panel wall. 
Side support according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that devices (9) for hanging up the demounted side 

support are provided on the cold room wall (6) of the 
ship. 
Side support according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that a peg-and-hole connection is provided for fastening 

the wall panel to the cold room floor (3). 
Side support according to claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the struts are each fastened in an articulating 

manner to the cold room wall of the ship in a holder (7) 
which consists of a U-profile and accommodates, at least 

partially, within itself the strut (5) which has been 
detached from the panel wall.  

 
Side support according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the holders (7) of the struts (5) on the cold room wall 

(6) of the ship accommodate between them, and secure 
against movement in the longitudinal direction of the 

ship, the panel wall (1) which is stowed, when not in 
use, in devices on the cold room wall (6) of the ship. 
Side support according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that each panel wall (1) has at least two bores (10) for 

a cable for securing it against theft.
