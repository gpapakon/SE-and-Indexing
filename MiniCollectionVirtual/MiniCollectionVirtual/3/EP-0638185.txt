<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for testing modules comprising boundary scanning cells and fitted with a plurality of different components. It is possible with the boundary scanning process to test both the internal logic of the components and the external logic from element to element or their connections, but not the input and output signal lines of the module. In order to be able to test it as well using the boundary scanning cells in the elements, according to the invention, a module output signal line (2) is connected via an adapter (1) to one or more module input signal lines (3) and the external test mode as per the boundary scan testing process is then performed.

Process for testing modules equipped with boundary 
scanning cells and fitted with a multiplicity of 

different components, characterized in that in each case 
one module output signal line (2) is connected by means 

of an adapter (1) to one or more module input signal 
lines (3), and in that the external test mode of the 

boundary scan testing process is then performed.
