<ABSTRACT>
A data recording and reproducing apparatus comprises 
a modulator (21) for MF-modulating recording data and a 

pulse converter (22) for generating a pulse signal having 
pulses which have a predetermined pulse width and which 

are synchronous with the leading and trailing edges of the 
pulses of the signal from the modulator (21). The apparatus 

further comprises an optical head (13), a peak detector (25), a 
flip-flop circuit (26) and a demodulator (27). The optical head 

(13) radiates a high-energy laser beam, or a recording beam, 
to an optical disk (11) in response to the pulse signal from the 

pulse converter (22), thereby recording the data on the disk 
(11). To reproduce the data, the optical head (13) continuous­

ly emits a low-energy laser beam to the disk (11). The beam 
reflected from the disk (11) is converted into an electrical 

signal. The peak detector (25) detects the peaks of the 
electrical signal and generates a pulse signal having pulses 

which are synchronous with the peaks of the electrical signal. 
The flip-flop circuit (26) generates a pulse signal having 

pulses which rise in synchronism with the trailing edges of 
the pulses of the signal from the peak detector (25) and 

whose widths correspond to the intervals of the peaks of the 
electrical signal. The demodulator (27) MF-demodulates the 

pulse signal from the flip-flop circuit (26), thereby reproduc­
ing the recording data.
