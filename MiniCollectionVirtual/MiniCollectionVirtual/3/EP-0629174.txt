<ABSTRACT>
When winding a thread according to the progressive precision winding process, the speed of rotation of a cross-winding motor is directly derived from the speed of rotation of the mandrel of the bobbin, preferably on the basis of the winding ratio valid at a moment in time, which is in turn determined from the crossing angle.
