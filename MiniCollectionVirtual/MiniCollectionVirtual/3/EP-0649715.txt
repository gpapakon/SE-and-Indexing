<ABSTRACT>
In order, in a device for making annular or tubular articles from concrete, with a moulding arrangement (1) having a vertical axis which forms, between a core (2) and a casing (3) surrounding the core (2) with a radial spacing, a moulding space which can be filled from above with concrete, with a charging and distributing arrangement (8), guided displaceably radially in relation to the moulding arrangement (1), for the concrete to be introduced into the moulding space, and with a moulding press (9), the plunger (17) of which bears a moulding ring (15) forming the upper closure of the moulding space and which is displaceable radially in relation to the moulding arrangement (1), to ensure especially simple construction conditions, it is proposed that the charging and distributing arrangement (8) for the concrete and the moulding press (9) are arranged one behind the other in the direction of displacement on a common carriage (7) which is guided radially displaceably in relation to the moulding arrangement (1).
