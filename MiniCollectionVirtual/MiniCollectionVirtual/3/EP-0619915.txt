<ABSTRACT>
An optical memory (10) is disclosed in which data is stored in an optical data layer (19) capable of selectively altering light such as by changeable transmissivity, reflectivity, polarization, and/or phase. The data is illuminated by controllable light sources (15) and an array of multi-surface imaging lenslets (21) project the image onto a common array of light sensors (27). Data is organized into a plurality of regions or patches (called pages) and by selective illumination of each data page, one of the lenslets (21) images the selected data page onto the light sensors (27). Light in the data image pattern strikes different ones of the arrayed light sensors (27), thereby outputting a pattern of binary bits in the form of electrical data signals. By selectively and sequentially illuminating different ones of the data regions (pages) on the data layer (19), correspondingly different data patterns are imaged by the corresponding lenslets (21) onto the common sensor array (27), thereby enabling many stored data pages to be retrieved by multiplexing at electro-optical speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL RANDOM ACCESS MEMORYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention concerns method and apparatus of opticall storing and retrieving mass digital data stored as light altering characteristics on an optical material and providin fast random access retrieval.Optical memories of the type having large amounts of digital data stored by light modifying characteristics of a film or thin layer of material and accessed by optical addressing without mechanical movement have been proposed bu have not resulted in wide spread commercial application. Th interest in such optical recording and retrieval technology due to its projected capability of faster retrieval of large amounts of data compared to that of existing electro-optical mechanisms such as optical discs, and magnetic storage such tape and magnetic disc, all of which require relative motion of the storage medium.For example, in the case of optical disc memories, it i necessary to spin the record and move a read head radially t retrieve the data, which is output in serial fashion. The serial accessing of data generally requires transfer to a buffer or solid state random access memory of a data process in order to accommodate high speed data addressing and other data operations of modern computers. Solid state ROM and RA can provide the relatively high access speeds that are sough but the cost, size, and heat dissipation of such devices whe 

 expanded to relatively large data capacities limit their applications.Examples of efforts to provide the relatively large capacity storage and fast access of an optical memory of the type that is the subject of this invention are disclosed in the patent literature such as U.S. Patent 3,806,643.for PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDS OF DIGITAL INFORMATION AND PLAYBACK SYSTEMS INCLUDING OPTICAL SCANNERS and U.S. Patent 3,885,094 for OPTICAL SCANNER, both by James T.
