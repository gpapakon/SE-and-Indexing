<ABSTRACT>
In a vehicle with two axles (12), each of which has at least one drivable wheel (11), each drivable wheel (11) is driven by a hydraulic motor (9) connected to a hydraulic source (6), and the driving power of each hydraulic motor (9) is transmitted to the respective wheel (11) by way of a step-up transmission (10, 35). The drivable wheels (11) are initially all driven with the same, first transmission ratio of the step-up transmission (10, 35). When a first limiting load is reached, the drive to the wheels of one axle (12) is reduced and when a second limiting load is reached, the transmission ratio of the step-up transmission (10, 35) is changed and the wheels which were driven before the first limiting load was reached are again driven equally.

A method of hydrostatically driving a vehicle with 
at least two ideal axles (12) each having at least one 

drivable wheel (11), each drivable wheel (11) being 
driven by at least one hydraulic motor (9) connected to 

a hydraulic source (6), and the drive power of each 
hydraulic motor (9) being transmitted to the respective 

wheel (11) by a transmission gear (10, 35),
 
characterised in that before reaching a first limiting 

load the drivable wheels (11) are driven at an 
identical first ratio of the transmission gear (10, 

35), on reaching the first limiting load the effective 
driving power of the wheels (11) of at least one ideal 

axle (12) is reduced, and on reaching a second limiting 
load the transmission gear (10, 35) ratio is altered 

and the wheels (11) driven before the first limiting 
load are driven at the same gear ratio.

that the effective driving power of a driven wheel (11) 

is reduced by lowering the displacement volume of the 
associated hydraulic motor (9). 
A method according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that when the 

transmission gear (10, 35) ratio is altered, the 
displacement volume of the hydraulic motors (9) is set 

at substantially zero.

preceding claims, characterised in that the 

transmission gear (10, 35) is shifted in stages.  
 
A method according to at least one of the
