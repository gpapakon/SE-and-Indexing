<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a prosthetic joint, in particular a knee or hip joint, which comprises a joint upper part (1), a joint lower part (2), a joint axis (3) which pivotably connects these two joint parts (1, 2) to one another and is connected so as to be fixed against rotation with one joint part (1), and a damping of the joint pivoting. In order to obtain, in particular, a more compact design of the joint it is proposed, according to the invention, that the damping be integrated in one (2) of the two joint parts (1, 2) and act directly upon the joint axis (3) which is connected so as to be fixed against rotation with the other joint part (1).

A prosthesis joint, more particularly a knee or hip
joint, with a joint upper section (1), a joint lower

section (2), a joint axle (3) pivotably connecting these
two joint sections (1, 2) with one another and non-rotatably

connected to a joint section (1), and with a
damping of the joint pivoting, the damping being integrated

into one (2) of the two joint sections (1, 2), acting
directly upon the joint axle (3) non-rotatably connected to

the joint section (1) and comprising a closed displacement
chamber (5), which at least partially concentrically

encloses the joint axle (3) over its circumference and is
divided into two partial chambers (5a, 5b) by the joint

axle (3) constructed as a rotary piston (3, 6, 7),
characterised in that the partial chambers (5a, 5b) of the

displacement chamber (5) are connected to one another via
two non-return throttle valves (10), which are connected in

parallel and act in opposite directions, and both throttle
sites can be externally actuated independently of one

another.
A prosthesis joint according to claim 1, characterised
in that the actuation of a throttle is effected by an

axially displaceable throttle rod (13).
A prosthesis joint according to claim 2, characterised
in that a manually adjustable knurled-head screw or the

like is provided for the displacement of the throttle
rod (13).
A prosthesis joint according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that means are provided, which allow a

force loading the joint to effect a pre-defined closure of
the bending throttle. 
A prosthesis joint according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the rotary piston (3, 6, 7)

comprises a rectangular piston plate (6), which rests
against the two end faces and the cylindrical inner wall of

the displacement chamber (5) via a sealing frame (7).
A prosthesis joint according to claim 5, characterised
in that the sealing frame (7) is fixed in position by a

retaining element screwed to the piston plate (6).
A prosthesis joint according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the rotary piston seal (8)

sealing the displacement chamber (5) relative to the
outside lies outside the rotary piston bearing (9).
A prosthesis joint according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that two bores (11) are provided

for the assembly of the two non-return throttle valves (10)
in the joint section (2) accommodating the displacement

chamber (5), the bores (11) being sealed relative to the
outside by a sealing plug (12).
A prosthesis joint according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the damping medium is a

hydraulic oil having high lubrication properties.
A prosthesis joint according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the joint upper section (1)

is supported with its part-cylindrical underside upon the
cylindrical surface (4) of the joint lower section (2)

arranged eccentric to the joint upper section.
