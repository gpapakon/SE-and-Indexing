<ABSTRACT>
An infrared sensor apparatus of the present 
invention has an infrared array element having infrared 

detection portions arranged at a plurality of positions 
in a two-dimensional array, and a plurality of infrared 

lenses arranged such that infrared images from a 
detection area divided into a plurality of portions are 

formed on the corresponding infrared detection portions 
without any superposition. These infrared lenses are a 

plurality of cylindrical lenses or Fresnel lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infrared
sensor apparatus for detecting an infrared heat source
such as a human body.Fig. 1 is a view showing a conventional infrared
sensor apparatus. In this infrared sensor apparatus, one
Fresnel lens 2 as an infrared lens is arranged for one
infrared sensor 1 on the incident side of the sensor 1.
This Fresnel lens 2 defines, e.g., a plurality of
infrared detection areas A to D.However, in this infrared sensor apparatus, for
example, when an infrared heat source such as a human body
enters the infrared detection areas A to D, the Fresnel
lens 2 condenses infrared radiation from the plurality of
areas, thereby detecting the infrared heat source by one
fixted infrared sensor 1. In this case, only the presence/
absence of an infrared heat source or movement thereof
is detected. A plurality of pieces of information such as
the position, the moving direction, and the moving speed
of the infrared heat source can hardly be detected in
detail. To detect information from an infrared heat source
in detail, a method is proposed, in which the fixed
infrared sensor 1 and the Fresnel lens are mechanically
moved to form the plurality of detection areas A to D.In another infrared sensor apparatus, as shown in
Fig. 2, a plurality of infrared sensors 1A to 1D are
disposed. The condensing portions of the Fresnel lens 2
are disposed in correspondence with the infrared sensors 1A
to 1D, thereby individually detecting infrared radiation
from the detection areas A to D.In the method of mechanically moving one infrared
sensor 1, however, a moving unit, movement control unit and
the like are required, resulting in a bulky and complicated
apparatus. When the plurality of infrared sensors 1A to 1D
are used, as in Fig. 2, the condensing portions of the
Fresnel lens 2 must correspond to the infrared detection
areas A to D. In this case, since a large lens is used,
highly precise manufacturing of the lens becomes very
difficult, and images may be blurred in some regions of the
lens. Additionally, the apparatus becomes bulky and
expensive.US Patent 4 321 594 discloses an infrared sensor
apparatus in which a plurality of detectors, disposed in a
matrix-like arrangement, are employed. Each detector has
a corresponding Fresnel lens which condenses infrared
radiation onto the detector.The present invention has been made to solve the
above problems, and has as its object to provide a 
compact and inexpensive infrared sensor apparatus capable
ofaccurately detecting a plurality of pieces of
information
