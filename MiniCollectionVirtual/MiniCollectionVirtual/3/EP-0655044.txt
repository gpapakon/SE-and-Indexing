<ABSTRACT>
A capsule (100) comprising upper (101) and lower (102) parts each having a dished formation (105, 106) and a peripheral rim, the rims being secured together so that the formations (105, 106) are at least partially in register with one another to provide at least one vented chamber (100a), means in at least one of the parts (101, 102) to communicate between the interior of the chamber (100a) and the exterior thereof and the lower part (102) having its exterior so formed as to enable it to be held in stable engagement with a surface but so that a fluid may pass freely between those parts (101, 102) of the exterior of the lower part (102) and the surface that are not in intimate engagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a capsule for storing and
dispensing at least one fluid under pressure and also to a
metal fluid container for storing and dispensing fluids,
generally liquids, under pressure and which incorporates
such a capsule. The invention is particularly although not
exclusively concerned with containers for carbonated
beverages. Such containers may be of steel or of an
aluminium alloy or of a plastics/metal laminate or of
plastics material.It is well known with some beers, and particularly draught
stout, for it to be desirable that a creamy head should be
formed on the beer when it is poured. Many such beers are
now sold in cans, usually of an aluminium alloy and are
pressurised by a gas. When the can is opened some
formation of a head will occur but it is well known to
enhance this by providing a second chamber in the form of
a capsule within the can, the capsule communicating with
the interior of the can via a valve or one or more small
holes.Frequently such capsules are of plastics material and are
a friction fit within the can. Specifications GB 2183592
and GB/PCT 91/07326 show such arrangements. However
friction fit capsules may damage the thin protective
coating customarily applied to the interior of the cans.
GB 2211813 has this same problem where the capsule is
formed from an inserted diaphragm.Other arrangements have also been proposed in which at
least part of the capsule is formed as a part of the can
construction either at the top or bottom thereof.The recycling of cans of aluminium alloy is now widely
practised and it has been found that when they contain 
capsules of plastics material problems arise in the
furnaces used.When the can is used for draught stout the second chamber
constituted by the capsule is subject to various pressures
in the following ways:
1) It is subject to atmospheric pressure when it is
installed in the can and subsequently when the stout
is first poured in.2) When the can is sealed the pressure therein quickly
rises to about 2,8 kg/cm2 (40 psi). The pressure within the
capsule rises more slowly because the fluid enters the
capsule more slowly. At this stage the overall
pressure on the capsule acts in the sense to collapse
it.3) Pasteurisation of the can at, say 60-80Â°C causes the
pressure therein to rise to say 4,9-5,6 kg/cm2 (70-80 psi). The
pressure in the capsule will again lag behind that in
the body of the can and the degree of lag will depend
both upon the size of the hole or holes in the capsule
(or the nature of its valve) and the rate of

<CLAIMS>
A capsule (6,100) forming a secondary chamber for
inclusion in a fluid container (1) having a generally

cylindrical body, at least part of the body defining a
closed primary chamber openable by manually operable means;

the capsule being closed except for means (114) therein to
communicate between the secondary chamber and the exterior

thereof in the primary chamber, characterised in that the
walls of the capsule are formed in two parts

(5,7,8,13,15,101,102) of metal bonded together, any exposed
outer edge (9,10,110,111) of which is protected from

exposure to the interior and exterior of the capsule by
being covered by a protective material, e,g, by a sealant,

and optionally being either inwardly or outwardly curled,
at least one of the parts (5, 7, 8, 13, 101,

102) having a dished formation, and at least one
of the parts having a peripheral rim (103, 104).

capsule is an aluminium alloy having a thickness of less than

500 microns, and preferably no greater than 300 microns.

(114) to communicate between the chambers extending from the
compartment to the exterior of the capsule.

the at least one part is formed of metal foil which is coated

externally, the coating having a thickness of 2 to 20 microns
and preferably 3 to 5 microns and is coated internally with

a coating having a thickness of 20 to 75 microns and
preferably 50 microns.
