<ABSTRACT>
There are provided a multi-viewpoint image 
database for holding images from a plurality of 

different viewpoints, a viewpoint detector for 
detecting a position of the observer's viewpoint, and a 

viewpoint parameter calculating portion for obtaining a 
viewpoint parameter from an output from the viewpoint 

detector. Further, a pixel value producing portion is 

provided for calculating a parameter necessary for 
reconstruction of image from the type of display screen 

and the viewpoint parameter, calculating with the 
parameter to which pixel in the images in the multi-viewpoint 

image database each pixel in a reconstructed 
image corresponds, and extracting corresponding pixels 

from the multi-viewpoint image database.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing method and an image processing apparatus, in which a plurality of images are taken in at different viewpoints to provide an image to be observed at a position of a viewpoint corresponding to a present position of the eyes of an observer.There are stereo displays and lenticular displays known as conventional apparatus for stereoscopically displaying images seen from a plurality of viewpoints. In the stereo displays, video images from two cameras are alternately switched at high speed to be displayed, so that an observer can stereoscopically observe the video images using shutter glasses or polarization glasses synchronized with the switching. Further, the lenticular displays are arranged as follows. For example, let A, B, C, D be images from four cameras and A (1,1) be a pixel position (1,1) in A. The images A, B, C, D from the cameras are arranged in the pixel unit (x,y) in order on a liquid crystal display 191, as shown in Fig. 11A. A lenticular sheet 192 is attached to the front face, as shown in Fig. 11B. As so arranged, the video images from four viewpoints can be stereoscopically expressed (Papers C, Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan, Vol. 112 No. 5, 1992, PP281-282; Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 3-269680).Using the conventional stereo displays as described above, the observer can, however, observe only stereoscopic images seen in the taking directions of the cameras at the time of photo-taking of the images. Because two cameras are generally fixed to take pictures of an object, the same image is observed by the observer even if the observer changes the viewpoint (the position of the eyes), raising a problem of lack of presence, i.e., not reflecting the movement of the observer's viewpoint. Although the lenticular displays can respond to the horizontal movement of the position of the observer's viewpoint, the observer can observe an image taken by either one of the cameras, among intermittent images taken by a plurality of cameras. Thus, the lenticular displays are not ready for continuous movement of the viewpoint nor for back-and-forth movement of the viewpoint. The back-and-forth movement of the viewpoint can be dealt with in case of stereoscopic view based on images produced by computer graphics. This is, however, possible under such special circumstances that the image handled by the computer graphics are simple and all corresponding coordinate values in a three-dimensional space are known for points in the images.
