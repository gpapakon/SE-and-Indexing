<ABSTRACT>
An improved dry barrel finishing machine in which a 
mass consisting of media (30) and workpieces is caused 

to flow in the barrel (1) of the machine for abrasive 
finishing of the workpieces and in which air suction is 

used to remove dust resulting from the finishing 
operation and to cool the barrel and the mass. The mass 

is caused to flow by rotation of the barrel by a motor 
(22) or through the vibration of the barrel by a driving 

mechanism (40;61). Air outlets (12,24) are provided in 
the barrel. An air suction device (23) draws air 

through the barrel and around the workpieces and media 
during the finishing operation. The drawn out air picks 

up dust and media particles resulting from the abrasive 
finishing operation and cools the media and the barrel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dry barrel finishing 
machine and a method of dry barrel finishing, wherein 
finishing media and workpieces are caused to flow in the 
barrel of the machine for fine abrasive finishing of the 
workpieces. Generally, barrel finishing is well known as a 
method for finely grinding workpieces such as bolts, 
shafts, bearings, etc. In barrel finishing, a mass, 
which is comprised of finishing media and workpieces, is 
charged into a receptacle, i.e. a barrel, and the barrel 
is activated to cause the mass to flow in it so as to 
finish the workpieces through interactive attrition 
between the workpieces and the media. Barrel finishing includes dry finishing and wet 
finishing. Wet finishing uses compounds and water as 
well as finishing media, while dry finishing does not 
use fluid. Wet barrel finishing requires washing and 
drying of the workpieces after the finishing, as well as 
water treatment for removing waste attrition fluid and 
waste washing water. It is well known that a drawback 
of wet barrel finishing is that it requires a drying 
apparatus and a fluid treatment device, and therefore it 
requires more space for these items. Another drawback 
is that wet barrel finishing takes additional time and 
labor. In view of such drawbacks, dry barrel finishing is 
often used. In dry barrel finishing, however, attrition 
produces dust and fragments of the media. Further, 
frictional heat is generated due to the attrition 
between the workpieces and the media, and between the 
barrel and the mass. The attrition dust tends to spread 
out of the barrel and contaminate the environment. The 
dust also causes clogging in the media, thereby lowering  
 
the abrasive ability of the media and resulting in 
uneven finishing on the workpieces. Further, in a 
conventional centrifugal barrel finishing machine, which 
has an upper stationary tank and a bottom rotary disc, 
fragments of the media tend to get caught in the space 
or slit between the rotary disc and the stationary tank. 
If any fragment becomes jammed in the slit, the rotating 
disc and the tank are heavily rubbed thereby, and a 
frictional heat of high temperature will be generated. 
This heat tends to melt any liners covering the surfaces 
of the disc and the tank, and as a result, fragments 
adhere to these liners, thereby hindering the rotation 
of the disc. Recently, artificial plastic media have been used 
in barrel finishing. This plastic medium is generally 
produced by externally heating, in a mold, a mixture of 
abras

driving means (20) for causing the mass to flow in 
the barrel; 
air suction means (23) connected to the barrel; and 
a dust collector (26) connected to the air suction 
means for receiving air with attrition dust therein from 

the air suction means, characterised in that the barrel 
includes: 
a stationary hollow cylindrical tank (4); 
a supporting plate (5) mounted on the base (2) for 
supporting said tank; and

located above and spaced apart from said supporting 

plate, said rotary plate forming with said supporting 
plate a passage (10), said rotary plate further forming 

with said tank the barrel (1) and a slit (12) around the 
bottom of the barrel for the air from the barrel to flow 

to the air suction means (23).

surface of said tank (4) and the upper surface of said 
rotary plate (9) are covered with liners (3,11). 
A machine as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
said driving means comprises a motor (22) mounted under 

the said supporting plate (5) for rotating the rotary 
plate (9) to cause the mass to flow in the barrel.

charging into an open barrel (1) a mass consisting 
of a predetermined amount of workpieces and finishing 

media (30); 
causing the mass to flow in the barrel; 
sucking air into the open barrel while the mass is 
flowing so that air passes through the mass; and
