<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite article 
comprising a support member, a controlled release 
material coated onto the support member, and an inorganic 
pigment; and a method of making the same. The composite 
article is useful in thermal imaging. Vapor deposited metallic thermal transfer 
ribbons typically require a release layer interposed 
between the metallic material to be transferred and the 
ribbon support in order for the metal to be effectively 
thermally transferred from the ribbon. Commercial 
thermal mass transfer printers are typically capable of 
providing a thermal transfer energy to the ribbons in the 
range from about 1-3 J/cm2. To produce high resolution 
images, a vapor deposited metallic thermal transfer 
ribbon should be constructed such that during thermal 
imaging at low thermal transfer energies (preferably, 
less than about 3 J/cm2), the vapor deposited metal 
transfers from the ribbon at the printed areas and 
adheres to the ribbon at the non-printed areas. Various attempts have been made to lower the 
adhesion of vapor deposited metal to the support member. 
Such attempts have generally been limited to use of 
chemical release coatings. Suitable chemical release 
coatings have a lower surface energy with respect to the 
support member than with respect to the vapor deposited 
metal, or vice versa, depending on the particular 
transfer application.  
 For example, in the September, 1988, issue of 
Office Equipment and Products, an article entitled 
"Matsushita Takes a Giant Step Forward With Its Ribbon 
Technology," described a metal thermal transfer ribbon 
having a 0.01 micrometer thick exfoliation layer. A paper entitled "New Color Thermal Transfer 
Printing Media" presented to "The 5th International 
Congress on Advances in Non-Impact Printing Technologies" 
in San Diego, CA, November 12-17, 1989, described a 
thermal metallic transfer ribbon having an anchoring 
layer interposed between the vapor deposited metal and a 
release layer to secure the vapor deposited metal to the 
release layer. U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,049 (Nelson) teaches a 
transfer sheet comprising, in successive layers, a 
carrier film, a metallic film, and an adhesive. 
Optionally, the transfer sheet further comprises, in 
successive layers, a release coat and a polymer coat 
interposed between the carrier film and the metallic 
film, and a primer coat interposed between the metallic 
film and adhesive. A preferred release coat is said to 
be made from an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. U.S. Pat, No.
