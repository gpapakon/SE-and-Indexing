<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing especially high temperature refractory materials from asbestos tailings, or from calcined products produced from asbestos tailings. The process comprises grinding the asbestos tailings, or the calcined product, to a suitable particle size, mixing the ground particles with magnesium oxide or a magnesium oxide precursor, and heating the mixture to a temperature of at least 1200 DEG C for a suitable length of time to form a large proportion of forsterite in the resulting product. The amount of magnesium oxide or precursor should preferably be such that the MgO:SiO2 ratio in the starting materials is at least 1.2, which usually requires an amount in the range of 10 to 25 % by weight, based on the weight of the asbestos tailings. Moreover, the particle size of the asbestos tailings or calcined product should preferably be in the range of -1.7 mm +/- 0.1 mm. The resulting refractory product has a fusion point above about 1660  DEG C and can be used in contact with molten steel or the like, particularly when mixed with a bridging agent such as graphite.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to refractory materials produced 
from tailings from asbestos mines. More specifically, this 
invention yields such refractory materials which are 
suitable for heat intensive metallurgical applications, such 
as for example in the taphole nozzles of sliding gate 
systems in steel mill ladles. Asbestos deposits normally occur in certain types of 
silicate rock which contain only about 5 to 10% by volume of 
asbestos fibres. Consequently, separation of the fibres 
from asbestos ore leaves large quantities of unwanted 
tailings which accumulate at or near extraction or 
processing sites. There is therefore a need to find novel 
commercial applications for these by-products of asbestos 
mining and refining operations. Chrysotile asbestos tailings normally contain a 
substantial proportion of hydrated magnesium silicates 
referred to as serpentine. Other components which occur 
with serpentine rock are brucite Mg(OH)2 and hematite-magnetite 
(Fe2O3-Fe3O4). Deposits of nickel may also occur in 
the rock. Known potential uses for asbestos tailings 
include the use of the tailings as a source of nickel 
extracted by magnetic separation of nickel- and iron-rich 
magnetic components; the transformation of the tailings into 
mineral wool by melting with carbon and forming fibers by 
blowing air through the resulting molten silicate; and the 
use of the tailings as a source of magnesium and/or 
magnesium compounds obtained by acid leaching and 
crystallisation. It is also known to calcine serpentine in order to produce 
sintered angular shaped granules useful as sandblasting or 
heat accumulating material, or to produce granular products 
useful as foundry mold sands. However, conventional 
calcination methods give rise to a number of drawbacks. For 
example, the conventional process of calcining serpentine 
results in the production of a synthetic harzburgite rich in  
 
a pyroxene of the silicate group and commonly referred to as 
enstatite. Enstatite is further subdivided into 
protoenstatite and clinoenstatite depending on its resulting 
crystallographic structure. However, these products have 
relatively low melting or softening points (less than 
1,600°C), and are therefore not useful as refractory 
materials for particularly high temperature operations, e.g. 
in the production of steel which involves exposure to 
temperature in the region of 1,700°C for several hours. The known methods of serpentine calcination normally 
involve heating the serpentine to a temperature of about 
1,300°C
