<ABSTRACT>
In a plasma torch (1) which consists of two or more tubular electrodes (2, 3) which are located coaxially inside one another and are designed for chemical treatment of the reactant, a lead-in tube (4) for supply of reactant is located coaxially in the internal electrode (3) and consists of a liquid-cooled tube provided with a heat-insulating layer (10, 11) on the outer surface. Furthermore the lead-in tube (4) can be moved in the axial direction for positioning of the nozzle in relation to the plasma flame. The lower part of the lead-in tube (4) is exposed to high temperatures which can lead to erosion and lacerations, and this part is therefore provided so as to be replaceable. Moreover the tube can be provided with a narrowing in the outlet opening in the form of a venturi nozzle, in order to increase the exit velocity of the reactant. Between the lead-in tube and the internal electrode an annular passage is formed into which plasma-forming gas (13) can be introduced. The plasma-forming gas (13) which flows along the lead-in tube will simultaneously cool it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a plasma torch provided with a 
lead-in tube for the supply of a reactant to a plasma torch. 
The plasma torch is used for the chemical treatment of a reactant, 
and it can be supplied with both plasma-forming gas and 
reactant. From Norwegian patent no. 164 846 there is known an 
electrically insulated supply tube for admixtures, which is 
provided centrally in an internal electrode in a plasma torch 
designed for submersion in a metallurgical smelt. In US 4 122 293 there is described an external liquid-cooled 
supply tube for the supply of gas, admixture and electric 
current to a hollow electrode which is used in an electric arc 
smelting furnace. Furthermore, EP 0 178 288 describes a nozzle for a plasma torch 
specially designed for heating a metallurgical melting pot. The 
nozzle has an electrode tip attached to a liquid-cooled 
electrode holder which simultaneously acts as a supply tube for 
plasma-forming gas and electric current. The electrode tip has 
a central boring for the plasma-forming gas and the outlet of 
the boring is designed first as a Laval nozzle and thereafter 
as a diffuser to permit the gas to be sprayed when it leaves 
the electrode. GB 995 152 describes an electric arc torch for a cutting 
apparatus which emits a jet of gas heated to a very high 
temperature by means of an electric arc which is struck between 
a torch body and a workpiece. The torch body consists of one 
elctrode within an arching chamber and the exit end of the 
cutting gas supply pipe can be provided with a venturi nozzle. 
However, the nozzle is not replaceable. From US 4 275 287 is known a plasma torch comprising a tubular 
bushing and a tubular electrode located coaxially with one  
 
inside the other. A lead-in tube for the supply of a reactant 
is located centrally in the electrode. The lead-in tube is 
water cooled and the lower part is removeable in order to 
facilitate replacement when it is worn after use. During chemical treatment of a reactant, for example during 
pyrolysis, it is essential that the gas has the correct 
temperature when it reaches the plasma flame. If the 
temperature of the gas exceeds a certain value it will react 
too early. This is undesirable as decomposition products can be 
formed before the gas reaches the plasma flame, and this can 
lead to precipitation of such products in the lead-in device 
and on the electrodes. It has been found that the known designs of supply devices for 
gas produce unsatisfactory results when used in a plasma torch
