<ABSTRACT>
A technique for detecting power demand to provide efficient 
power sharing is described. The technique is particularly but 

not exclusively concerned with providing a power sharing 
detector for use in a portable computer which requires battery 

charging to be done concurrently with computer usage, and 
preferably provides three different rates of charging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power sharing detector for
detecting power demand to provide efficient power sharing.US-A-5157269 describes a power supply system which supplies power
using a number of power modules. The arrangement is such that
the modules are all used equally to avoid stressing an individual
module.GB-A-2260231 describes a power management system for battery
powered computers which monitors the charging and discharging
history of the battery.EP-A-479243 describes a computer with batteries where only when
the computer is off are the batteries quick charged by the
battery charger.The present invention is particularly but not exclusively
concerned with providing a power sharing detector for use in a
portable computer which requires battery charging to be done
concurrently with computer usage.Figure 1 is a block diagram of a battery charging system for
such an application. It shows the basic structure of a switch
mode power supply and battery charger for a portable computer
in block diagram form. Mains power is converted from its ac
form at a supply Y8 into a dc form along line Y7 to be fed to
a battery via a constant current charger Y2 and to an
auxiliary output AO which is for connection to a computer.If power is needed by the charger Y2 for charging a battery
pack Y4 connected to the charger Y2 and at the same time power
is required to be supplied via the auxiliary output AO to the
computer, the total power needed must be supplied from the
supply Y8 via the power supply converter components Y1,Y6,Y17
and Y5. Thus, the result is that the power supply converter
components must be designed to match the maximum possible
power demanded from it. For example, if the computer utilises 25W at the peak of its
operation and the maximum power needed for battery charging at
its fastest rate is 20W, the power supply converter has to be
designed for 45W, assuming lossless power conversion.
However, at times when charging is done without the computer
being used, then the power supply converter is under utilised.If a power sharing concept is used, the power supply converter
can be designed for only 35W but can still meet both power
demands. For example, the charger can be designed to perform
two rates of charging, one for the original rate, requiring
20W, and another, slower rate at 10W. In this way, during
charging using the faster rate of 20W, when the computer is
suddenly turned on, this can be detected by a charge
controller and the charger can thus be switched to the slower
charging rate of 10W,
