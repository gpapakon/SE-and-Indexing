<ABSTRACT>
A highly water-absorbing resin composition obtained by fusing or fixing a thermoplastic resin to the surface of a highly 
water-absorbing resin either through an adhesive binder or directly, and its composition comprises 1 to 100 parts by weight of the 

thermoplastic resin per 100 parts by weight of the highly water-absorbing resin. When this composition is employed, a highly water-absorbing 
resin can be firmly bonded to a fibrous substrate, and a water-absorbing material which stably holds the highly water-absorbing 

resin even after water absorption can be obtained. Accordingly, a greater amount of the highly water-absorbing resin 
can be held by a substance such as a fibrous substrate than in the prior art, and the present invention can provide a 

water-absorbing composite material suitable for various applications, e.g. sanitary field such as a paper diaper and sanitary napkin, 
and water-absorbing materials of industrial materials such as for horticulture and agriculture and foodstuffs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
water-absorbent resin composition prepared by forming a
composite by fusing grains of a thermoplastic resin onto
a surface of a water-absorbent resin via a urethane adhesive. The high
water-absorbent resin composition obtained by the present
invention has enhanced adhesion. For example, when the
high water-absorbent resin composition of the present
invention is used in adhesion to fibrous base materials
such as various nonwoven fabrics, pulps or papers, it
provides a water-absorbent material which is not
detached from the fibrous base materials even after which
the water-absorbent resin absorbs water.The water-absorbent resin is a functional resin
capable of absorbing and retaining water from several
dozens to 1000 times the weight thereof, and because of
this property, it is widely utilized in hygienic materials
such as paper diapers and sanitary napkins and
agricultural and horticultural materials.However, these water-absorbent resins are
usually in the form of powders having no adhesion, and in
order to use them in the above-mentioned applications, the
mentioned resin is spread over fibrous base materials such 
as nonwoven fabrics, pulps or papers to obtain a
water-absorbent material with a sandwich structure. In
this case, in order to fix the water-absorbent resin
to the base material, a method comprising slightly
swelling the resin by water spraying and then subjecting
the swollen resin to embossing or press drying using a
roll is normally carried out.However, the conventional method for fixing the
water-absorbent resin mentioned above has some drawbacks
as mentioned below. Specifically, in the method for
fixing a water-absorbent resin to a fibrous base
material by water spraying, etc., the insufficient
adhesion to the base material results in gel detachment
upon water absorption, so that the amount of the
water-absorbent resin to be added for the prevention of
the gel detachment is limited. Also, in the case where
the water is used, a drying process becomes necessary for
subsequent water removal, and at the same time, the touch
of the product is affected.An object of the present invention is to provide a
water-absorbent resin composition having enhanced
adhesion to the base material by giving adhesion to the
water-absorbent resin having non-thermoplasticity,
which is not detached from the fibrous base material
mentioned above even after the water-absorbent resin
absorbs water in the case where it is used in the themal
adhesion to fibrous base materials, such as
