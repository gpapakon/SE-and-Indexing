<ABSTRACT>
An active matrix surface pressure input panel 
comprises a flexible pressure sheet (3) stacked onto a circuit 

base plate. The pressure sheet includes a conductive layer (7) 
and the circuit base plate (5) comprises an insulating plate (10) with 

first and second groups (15,17) of intersecting electrode lines and a 
multiplicity of detection elements formed thereon. Each 

detection element (21) includes a contact plate (23) coupled to the 
electrode lines by a switch (19), such as a thin film transistor or 

diode, and configured to generate an electrical signal when 
the overlying portion of the conductive layer contacts the 

contact plate. The electrode lines are coupled to an 
electrical circuit that determines the relative location of 

each electrical signal to map an overall surface pressure 
distribution. With this configuration, the surface pressure 

input panel exhibits high definition over a relatively large 
detection area so that complicated surfaces, such as 

fingerprints, can be accurately detected and reproduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surface pressure input:
panels generally and more specifically to an active matrix
type surface pressure input panel suitable for detecting
complicated surface contours and irregularities such as a
fingerprint pattern.The inside surface of the fingertip has intricate
contours that are unique to each individual. This has made
the fingerprint pattern an important vehicle for
identification, particularly for law enforcement purposes. To
facilitate identification via fingerprints, efforts have been
made to develop fingerprint detection devices capable of
electronically mapping an individual fingerprint pattern.
Accurately mapping the contour of each person's fingertip,
however, has proven to be a difficult and expensive task.
This is because each fingerprint pattern is made up of a large
number of convex portions, or ridges, separated by concave
portions or grooves that generally extend in random directions
around the fingertip. These ridges and grooves have minute
dimensions, on the order of 100µm, making them difficult to
detect.Conventional fingerprint detection devices generally
employ a surface pressure input panel that includes a contact
sheet that changes in some manner when it is engaged by the
various ridges and grooves of the fingertip. One such device
comprises a conductive rubber sheet that undergoes local
variations in conductivity when engaged by a surface with a
pressure differential. Similar devices include a resistive
film that varies in resistance with changes in surface
pressure. These devices employ a means for detecting the
changes in the contact sheet or film in order to
electronically map the contour of the fingertip. The 
detection means, however, typically has difficulty detecting small pressure changes,
particularly when a non-uniform pressing force is applied or the fingertip is contaminated
with grease, sweat or the like. One such device is described in European Patent
Application EP-A-0 465 231, having the same applicant as the present invention.
Therefore, these devices are often incapable of accurately detecting the small surface
variations necessary for mapping the countour of a fingertip.Other fingerprint detection devices have attempted to overcome this problem by
employing MOS field-effect transistors or piezoelectric thin films to detect small surface
variations. These devices, however, generally require complicated manufacturing
techniques and relatively expensive materials, such as silicon semiconductor substrates.
