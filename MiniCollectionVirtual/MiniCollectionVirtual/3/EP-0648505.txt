<ABSTRACT>
An method for cleaning and disinfecting a soft 
contact lens, characterized by immersing the soft 

contact lens in a treating solution which does not 
generate any hypohalite during electrolysis, supplying a 

direct current, and raising the temperature of the 
treating solution; and a treating solution for a soft 

contact lens, characterized by containing a treating 
agent mainly composed of boric acid and borax in a 

concentration of at most 2.2 w/v% and having an 
electrical conductivity of at most 8 mS/cm are 

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a method for 
cleaning and disinfecting a soft contact lens and a 
treating solution for a soft contact lens. A soft contact lens (hereinafter referred to as 
lens) has some apprehensions that eyes are injured when 
the lens is continuously worn in eyes as it is for a 
long period of time because stains in the 
surroundings, microbes, proteins contained in tear 
fluid, and the like adhere to the lens while the lens is 
worn in eyes. Accordingly, there is a necessity to 
clean or disinfect the lens regularly, preferably every 
day. As a method for cleaning a lens, a method 
comprising washing a lens with a solution containing a 
surface active agent by fingers has been conventionally 
carried out, and according to the method, stains on the 
surface of the lens can be removed. However, stains 
such as proteins got into the internal of a lens cannot 
be removed. Further, when the lens is boiled to 
disinfect as it is, denaturation or coagulation of the 
proteins being got into a lens proceeds, and denatured 
proteins or coagulated proteins are more stiffly adhered 
to the lens. As a result, there occurs a problem of 
generation of cloudiness of the lens. As a cleaning agent for reusing a lens stained 
with proteins, a cleaning agent containing a proteolytic 
enzyme has been conventionally known. However, 
according to the cleaning method of using this cleaning 
agent, although proteins adhered to the surface of a  
 
lens can be decomposed, besides taking a long period of 
time for revealing the cleaning effects, sufficient 
removing effects of proteins cannot be revealed because 
the proteolytic enzyme itself should be immersed into 
the internal of a lens so that proteins being denatured 
in the internal of a lens can be decomposed. Also, U.S. Patent No. 4,732,185 discloses a 
method for cleaning a lens comprising establishing an 
electric field in a determined direction in a boric 
acid-EDTA buffer solution having a range of pH 8 to 9 
and immersing a lens in the solution to remove proteins 
from the lens by electrophoresis. When this method is 
carried out, contaminated proteins in the internal of 
the lens can be removed. However, the method requires 
that proteins should not be denatured nor ionized, and 
there are some problems in the method such that it takes 
a long period of time for the treatment. Further, 
according to the method disclosed in the above U.S. 
Patent, boric acid is used in a high concentration such 
as 0.808 mol/ℓ and pH is kept at an alkaline level
