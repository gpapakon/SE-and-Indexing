<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a securing means (1) with a pipe clamp (2) or similar retaining part, which is connected, via a bar-shaped spacer (4) engaging thereon, to at least one further retaining part and/or to a fastening element (5). In order to adapt the securing means (1) to local conditions in a simple manner and optionally without using any tools and to be able to shorten the spacer (4) thereof to a desired length, the bar-shaped spacer (4) exhibits, in the course of its longitudinal extent, at least one prefabricated cross-sectional weakening point (9) which serves as a separating point.

<CLAIMS>
A mounting system using a pipe clamp or similar 
retaining member which, by way of a rod-shaped spacer 

engaged therewith, is connected to at least one further 
retaining member and/or to a fastening element, 


characterized in that
 the rod-shaped spacer (4) has 
over its length at least one preproduced necking (9) 

serving as parting point. 
A mounting system as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the spacer (4) has a plurality of preferably 

equi-spaced neckings (9). 
A mounting system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the spacer (4) has a round cross 

section, at least in the region of the neckings (9), 
and that the neckings (9) take the form of turned 

recesses. 
A mounting system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the spacer (4) has at least at 

its free end zone, preferably throughout its length, an 
external thread (6) and that the neckings (9) are 

provided in the region of the external thread (6). 
A mounting system as claimed in any one of claims 3 or 
4, characterized in that the turned recesses (9) are 

defined in each case by two circumferential notch 
flanks (10, 11) preferably including an angle (a) of 

approximately 90Â° therebetween. 
A mounting system as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the notch base (12) of the turned recesses (9) 

in each case has a diameter (A) of about 4.5 to 5 mm.  
 
A mounting system as claimed in any one of claims 5 or 
6, characterized in that the notch base (12) of the 

turned recesses (9) is in each case arranged outside 
the cross-sectional area of the thread. 
A mounting system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the spacer is made of metal, 

particularly of steel, or of plastic.
