<ABSTRACT>
A chop saw is described consisting of a stand, a pivoting saw 
unit including the blade (18) and the saw guard (66), a guard lock 

(34) to lock the guard (66) closed, a housing lock (76,78) to lock the 
saw unit in a raised inoperative position and a handle (52) attached 

to the saw unit. The handle (52) includes a push-button (50), 
depression of which releases the guard lock (34) and the housing 

lock (76,78) and opens the guard (66). The push-button (50) is 
biassed into its elevated position. The guard lock (34) is biassed 

towards its released position, but is coupled to the push-button (50) 
in such a way that this bias is overcome. Depressing the push button 

(50) first allows the guard lock (34) to relax to its released position 
and then, through a series of linkages, opens the guard (60) and 

releases the housing lock (76,78). So that the push-button (50) is 
easy to maintain in its depressed position, its biassing means (31) 

e.g. a leaf spring is 
arranged to exert substantially zero opening torque thereon when 

depressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to saws, e.g. chop saws, mitre saws, etc., 
consisting of a stand, a pivotable saw unit including a saw blade and 
a pivotable saw guard and a guard lock which locks the saw guard in 
a closed position, in which it shields the saw blade. Such a saw as above is known from DE-C-4010455. The saw 
includes a handle, to which a lever is pivotally attached. Movement 
of the lever first causes the guard lock to release the saw guard and 
then causes the saw guard to rotate to an open position, exposing the 
blade. The lever is attached to an arm, part of which obstructs the 
movement of the saw guard from its closed position. A cable is 
attached at one end to the arm and at the other end wraps around a 
spindle integral with the guard. Movement of the arm therefore 
removes the obstruction from the path of the saw guard and, by 
means of the cable, causes the saw guard to rotate to its open 
position. Since some movement of the arm is required before the guard 
can rotate to its open position, this arrangement introduces a certain 
amount of undesirable slack when the saw guard is locked closed. 
This results in some movement of the saw guard being possible 
when locked in its closed position. Although not shown in DE-C-4010455, various spring biassing 
means must be provided in order to ensure that the various locks and 
guards return to their effective positions when the saw is at rest. 
However, they each add to the force which must be maintained on  
 
the lever when the saw is operated and this force need not be much 
in order to be excessive from the user's point of view after several 
hours of use. It is an object of the present invention to provide a saw which is 
substantially free from these disadvantages. It has been found that 
these disadvantages can be overcome through the use of a 
combination of a guard lock biassed towards its released position, at 
which the saw guard is not locked closed, and a push-button coupled 
to the guard lock and biassed into its elevated position with sufficient 
strength to overcome the biassing of the guard lock. Thus, at rest, 
the push-button lies in its elevated position and the guard lock lies in 
its locked position, locking the saw guard in its closed position. The 
push-button will also be coupled to the saw guard such that 
depression of the push-button causes the saw guard to move to its 
open position. The advantage of using this arrangement is that the 
push-button need not be coupled actively to the guard lock, since the 
guard

<CLAIMS>
A saw comprising a stand, a pivotable saw unit including a saw 
blade and a pivotable saw guard movable between a closed position, 

in which it shields the saw blade, and an open position, a guard lock 
movable between a locked position locking the saw guard in its 

closed position and a released position and biassed towards its 
released position, a push-button pivotally mounted on the saw unit 

about an axis and movable between an elevated rest position and a 
depressed position, and biassing means acting between an 

attachment point on the saw unit and an insertion point on the 
push-button to bias the push-button into its elevated position, the 

push-button being coupled to the guard lock and the saw guard such 
that when the push-button is in its elevated position, the guard lock 

is in its locked position, and such that depression of the push-button 
causes the guard lock to move to its released position and the saw 

guard to its open position, wherein, when the push-button moves 
towards its depressed position, the plane containing the said axis and 

the attachment point and the plane containing the said axis and the 
insertion point approach one another. 
A saw according to claim 1 in which the saw unit is pivotable 
between a raised position and a lowered operative position and 

including a housing lock movable between a locked position locking 
the saw unit in its raised position and a released position, the 

push-button being coupled to the housing lock such that when the 
push-button is in its elevated position, the housing lock is in its 

 
locked position, and such that depression of the push-button causes 

the housing lock to move to its released position. 
A saw according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the push-button is 
coupled to the guard lock by means of a flexible cable which 

maintains the guard lock in its closed position when the push-button 
is in its elevated position. 
A saw according to any preceding claim wherein the push-button 
is coupled to the saw guard by means of one or more linkages which, 

on depression of the push-button, begin to move only after the 
push-button has been depressed by a predetermined distance. 
A saw according to claim 4 wherein the one or more linkages 
include a linkage bar, to one end of which the push-button is 

connected, that end of the linkage bar including an elongate slot 
which receives a pin integrally attached to the push-button, wherein 

the push-button must be depressed by the said predetermined 

distance before the pin traverses the elongate slot and begins to 
move the linkage bar. 
A saw according to any preceding claim wherein the biassing 
means is a leaf spring. 
A saw according to claim 6 wherein the leaf spring acts between 
a shoulder on the saw unit and a shoulder on the push-button, the 

shoulders being spaced from the said axis by unequal distances. 
A saw substantially as described herein with reference to the 
accompanying drawings.
