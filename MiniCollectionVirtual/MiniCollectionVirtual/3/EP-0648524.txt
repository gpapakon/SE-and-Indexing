<ABSTRACT>
A filter cartridge is provided which includes a depth filter and a pleated filter 
having a lower micron retention rating than the depth filter. The depth filter and pleated 

filter surround a central opening. The cartridge is sealed and an appropriate inlet or 
outlet is provided in order to assure sequential fluid flow first through the depth filter 

and then through the pleated filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter cartridge construction suitable for filtering liquids 
and gases. At the present time a wide variety of filter cartridge constructions are utilized to 
purify fluids. These cartridge constructions are designed to remove solids and colloidal 
particles as well as microorganisms. The basic two separate and distinct types of 
cartridges used in filtration of gases and liquids are depth filters (typically wound) and 
surface or screen filters (usually pleated). A depth filter is primarily used to remove 
most of the contaminants and particles. It is typically utilized upstream of a surface or 
screen filter. The most important properties for a depth filter are its "dirt holding 
capacity" or throughput, pressure drop and retention. The filter design allows 
contaminants and particles to be trapped in stages within the depth of the filter due to 
the construction of the multiple layers of various media types. A wound depth filter has 
multiple layers with the most open media (largest micron retention rating) on the 
outside adjacent the liquid inlet with the tightest media (smallest micron retention 
rating) at the core adjacent the liquid outlet. The media at the core will have the least 
amount of surface area due to the smallest diameter around which it is wrapped. This 
layer at the core contributes to most of the pressure drop of the cartridge because the 
media has the highest pressure drop and the least amount of filtration surface area. 
Likewise, this layer will significantly reduce the capacity of the filter due to both the low 
filtration surface area and the smallest micron retention rating. A surface or screen filter will retain virtually 100% of the particles or 
contaminants for which it is rated. The media used in a surface or screen filter typically 
has a high pressure drop and low "dirt holding capacity" or throughput because of its  
 
high retention efficiency. The media normally used in a surface filter comprises glass 
or polymeric microfibers. The normally used medium in a screen filter comprises a 
polymeric microporous membrane. Particles are retained by size exclusion primarily on 
the surface of the screen filter rather than within the depth of the filter. Particles are 
retained primarily on the surface of a surface filter which has a controlled pore size. 
Particles smaller than the controlled pore size tend to be trapped within the media of 
the surface filter. However as a result of the controlled pore structure, they provide 
more
