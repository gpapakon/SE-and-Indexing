<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with government support under 1R01DK41921-03,
1R01DK43859-01, and 1P01DK44239-10A1 by the National Institutes of
Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.This invention relates to melanocyte stimulating hormone receptors from
mammalian species and the genes corresponding to such receptors. Specifically,
the invention relates to the isolation, cloning and sequencing of a human
melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor gene. The invention also relates to the
isolation, cloning and sequencing of a mouse melanocyte stimulating hormone
receptor gene. The invention relates to the construction of eukaryotic
recombinant expression constructs capable of expressing these melanocyte
stimulating hormone receptors in cultures of transformed eukaryotic cells, and the
production of the melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor in such cultures. The
invention relates to the use of such cultures of transformed eukaryotic cells to
produce homogeneous compositions of such melanocyte stimulating hormone
receptors. The invention also provides cultures of such cells producing
melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor for the characterization of novel and
useful drugs. Antibodies against and epitopes of these melanocyte stimulating
hormone receptor proteins are also provided by the invention.The proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene product is processed to produce
a large number of biologically active peptides. Two of these peptides,
α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) have well understood roles in control of melanocyte and adrenocortical
function, respectively. Both of these hormones, however, are found in a variety
of forms with unknown functions. The melanocortin peptides also have a diverse 
array of biological activities in other tissues,
including the brain, and immune system, and bind to
specific receptors there with a distinct pharmacology
[see, Hanneman et al., in Peptide Hormone as Prohormones,
G. Martinez, ed. (Ellis Horwood Ltd.: Chichester, UK) pp.
53-82; DeWied & Jolles, 1982, Physiol. Rev. 62: 976-1059
for reviews].A complete understanding of these peptides and
their diverse biological activities requires the
isolation and characterization of their corresponding
receptors. Some biochemical studies have been reported
on the prior art.Shimuze, 1985, Yale J. Biol. Med. 58: 561-570
discusses the physiology of melanocyte stimulating
hormone.Tatro & Reichlin, 1987, Endocrinology 121:
1900-1907 disclose that MSH receptors are widely
distributed
