<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface treatment 
method and a surface treatment apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a method of forming a thin layer of polycrystalline 
silicon on a substrate, and to a method of forming a 
channel of a metal insulation semiconductor (MIS) 
transistor using the method of forming a thin layer of 
polycrystalline silicon. Also, more particularly, 
the present invention relates to a surface treatment 
apparatus such as a laser light emitting apparatus 
adaptive to perform, for example, a laser light annealing 
treatment, where the area of irradiation by a single shot 
of laser light is relatively large and an energy density 
of irradiated laser light is high, to thereby form, for 
example, a thin layer of polycrystalline silicon from an 
amorphous silicon layer. First, the formation of a thin layer (film) of 
polycrystalline silicon on a substrate of a transistor 
will be described. Thin film transistors (hereinafter referred to as 
TFTs) using amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon 
thin films are used for the transistors for driving 
pixels in liquid crystal displays, the transistors of  
 
peripheral elements, load element type static RAMs 
(hereinafter referred to as SRAMs), etc. Polycrystalline silicon, however, has a higher 
density of unbonded arms of silicon atoms compared with 
monocrystalline silicon, so these unbonded arms become 
the cause of generation of a leakage current at the time 
the transistors are switched off. As a result, they 
become a cause of a reduced operating speed at the time 
of switching the transistors on. Accordingly, to improve 
the characteristics of a TFT, it is demanded to form a 
polycrystalline silicon thin film with few crystal 
defects and superior uniformity. As a method for 
formation of such a polycrystalline silicon thin film, 
the chemical vapor deposition method and the solid-state 
deposition method have been proposed. As the means for 
reducing the unbonded arms causing leakage current etc., 
use is made of the hydrogenation technique of doping 
hydrogen in the polycrystalline silicon thin film so as 
to cause hydrogen to bond with the unbonded arms. If the chemical vapor deposition method is used for 
growing large grain size crystals and forming a 
polycrystalline silicon thin film, however, the thickness 
becomes nonuniform. With the chemical vapor deposition 
method, it is difficult to obtain a polycrystalline 
silicon thin film with a uniform thickness. Accordingly, 
it becomes
