sensors for measuring the temperature, the pH or the 
concentration of the dissolved gases, and means (16a) for 

withdrawing from the medium or for adding various substances 
or compositions such as fresh medium or constituents 

of this medium, in the liquid, dissolved and/or 
gaseous form. 
Device according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that it comprises an additional pipe (19-1), preferably 

equipped with an isolating clamp (17), which makes 
it possible to produce a loop for circulating the liquid 

medium, the said loop including the enclosure (5) and the 
pump (8) but isolating the receptacle (10) which forms 

the reservoir of the medium. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that it additionally contains, especially 

at the said receptacle (10) forming the reservoir, 
means (25 to 33) which make it possible to draw off, 

alternately or continuously, at least part of the medium 
and to treat the latter, especially in order to extract 

substances, in particular those initially incorporated in 
the medium or those produced during the incubation of the
