<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a polymerisation process for the preparation of polymethacrylate moulding compositions having a high heat deflection temperature (heat resistance) and high stability to thermal degradation, in which at least 70% by weight of the polymethacrylate moulding composition is prepared at a monomer concentration of at least 5 mol per litre of reaction mixture, which preferably contains the monomers, the polymer formed therefrom and further polymerization auxiliaries. The reaction is preferably carried out batchwise (discontinuously), for example in a stirred reactor operated in batch mode.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds comprising more than 75 wt.% of methyl 

methacrylate and which have high dimensional stability 
under heat and a high resistance to thermal 

disintegration, by means of which process methacrylate 
monomers are polymerised in reactors that ensure a high 

degree of intermixing, the polymerisation being 
discontinued after a specified reaction has been 

achieved and the non-reacted monomers being separated 
from the reaction mixture, characterised in that at 

least 70 wt.% of the moulding compound is prepared with 
a monomer concentration of more than 5 mol/litre of 

reaction mixture and at a polymerisation temperature 
between 30 and 120Â°. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds according to claim 1, characterised in that 

the amount of polymerisation initiator in the reaction 
mixture is below 0.05 wt.%. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds according to claims 1 to 2, characterised in 

that the amount of molecular weight regulator in the 
reaction mixture is between 0.1 and 2 wt.%. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in 

that the polymethacrylate moulding compounds comprise 
more than 75 wt.% of methyl methacrylate as 

homopolymerised monomer portions. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in  

 
that the polymerisation process is carried out 

discontinuously. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that the non-reacted monomer portion is isolated in a 
separate process step by vacuum distillation. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding

that the isolated, non-reacted monomer portion undergoes 
a subsequent reaction. 
A process for preparing polymethacrylate moulding 
compounds according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in 

that polymerisation inhibitors are added to the reaction 

mixture, in amounts of 10
-2
 up to 1 wt.% based on the 
reaction mixture, in order to complete the 

polymerisation.
