<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for 
producing hydrogen peroxide by reacting oxygen and hydrogen 

in a reaction medium catalytically using, as a catalyst, 
a tin-modified platinum group metal supported on a 

carrier. In the process using said catalyst, the presence 
of halogen ion and acid in reaction medium is 

unnecessary unlike in conventional processes, and hydrogen 
peroxide of high concentration can be produced efficiently. 

Thus, the present process has no restriction 
for reactor material as seen in conventional processes 

and further allows for easy purification of produced 
hydrogen peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
process for producing hydrogen peroxide by reacting
oxygen and hydrogen catalytically in a reaction medium.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
process for producing hydrogen peroxide, which comprises
reacting oxygen and hydrogen in a reaction medium in the
presence of a catalyst comprising a tin-modified platinum
group metal.The main process for industrial production of
hydrogen peroxide currently in use is an autoxidation
process using an alkylanthraquinone as a medium. This
process has problems in that it requires many steps such
as reduction of alkylanthraquinone, oxidation, extraction
and separation of formed hydrogen peroxide, purification,
concentration and the like, making large the equipment
cost and operational cost. The process has further
problems of the loss of alkylanthraquinone due to its
deterioration, the deterioration of reduction catalyst,
etc.Because of these problems, there were studied
various other processes. In some of these processes,
hydrogen peroxide is produced directly from oxygen and
hydrogen in a reaction medium using a catalyst. There
were actually proposed processes of producing hydrogen
peroxide from oxygen and hydrogen using a platinum group
metal as a catalyst and, in these proposals, formation of
hydrogen peroxide of relatively high concentration is
reported [Japanese Patent Publication No. 47121/1981,
Japanese Patent Publication No. 18646/1980, Japanese
Patent Publication No. 23401/1989 and Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 156005/1988]. In any
of these processes, there is used, as the reaction medium,
an aqueous solution containing an acid or an inorganic
salt. In Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open)
No. 156005/1988 is disclosed a process for producing
hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and hydrogen under
pressure in an aqueous acidic solution, using a platinum
group metal catalyst. This process can produce a solution
of hydrogen peroxide of high concentration selectively
by allowing said aqueous solution to further
contain a halogen ion (e.g. bromine ion). In this process,
however, it is necessary to allow the reaction
medium to contain a promoter of halogen ion, in order to
obtain hydrogen peroxide at a high selectivity.Further in U.K. Patent No. 1056121 and U.S.
Patent No. 4009252 is disclosed a process for producing
hydrogen peroxide directly from oxygen and hydrogen in a
reaction medium, using a catalyst, wherein a stabilizer
for hydrogen peroxide is added to the reaction
