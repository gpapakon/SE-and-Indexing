<ABSTRACT>
In key and lock systems in which data and power are transmitted via a single coil pair, the data transmission from the key to the lock is frequency-modulated rather than load-modulated. For this purpose, the stationary unit, e.g. the lock, has a free-running oscillator whose resonant circuit forms part of the transmission system. The impedance modulation is carried out according to the invention in the moving part, i.e. on the key side, for example. This can be done, for example, by inserting capacitances in the resonant circuit.

<CLAIMS>
Data transmission system comprising a stationary
unit (ST) and a movable unit (BT), in which a coil (6;

7) for the contactless transmission of energy and data
is provided in each case in the stationary unit (ST)

and in the movable unit (BT), the stationary unit (ST)
supplying the movable unit (BT) with energy, having a

control unit (1) provided in the stationary unit (ST)
and serving for driving the transmission coil (6),
characterized in that
the transmission circuit situated in the
stationary part (ST) is free-running,
the movable part has an impedance modulator which
modulates the impedance of the transmission circuit

situated in the movable part (BT) in a manner dependent
on the data to be transmitted, so that the frequency of

the energy oscillation to be transmitted is modulated
in the stationary part (ST),
the stationary part has means for frequency
detection (2).
Data transmission system according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the movable unit (BT) has a
controllable switching element (10) and a capacitance

(9) connected in series therewith, which are connected
in parallel with the coil.
Data transmission system according to Claim 1 or
2,
characterized in that
 the stationary unit (ST) has a
transformer, one of whose circuits is connected to the

control unit (1) and whose other circuit is connected
to the transmission coil (6).
