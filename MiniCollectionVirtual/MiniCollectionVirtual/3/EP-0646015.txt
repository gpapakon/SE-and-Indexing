<ABSTRACT>
The subject disclosure relates to methods of contraception, and compositions useful in such methods. Disclosed are methods in which one or more sperm surface proteins are administered to a mammal, the administration being effective in stimulating an immune response whereby antibody which binds to the sperm surface protein is produced in a titer sufficient to prevent or substantially reduce the rate of sperm-egg fusion. Antigenic sperm surface protein peptides are also useful for this purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
Immunization of male and female animals with extracts
of whole sperm cells is known to cause infertility (Tung,
K., et al., J. of Reproductive Immunol., 1: 145-158 (1979)
and Menge, A., et al., Biol. of Reproduction, 20: 931-937
(1979)). Also, men and women who spontaneously produce
antisperm antibodies are infertile, but otherwise healthy
(Bronson, R. et al., Fert. and Steril., 42: 171-183
(1984)). Although the critical sperm antigens are
unknown, these observations have led to the proposal that
sperm proteins might be useful in the development of a
contraceptive vaccine.In mammalian species, sperm proteins have been
proposed to have a role in sperm adhesion to the zona
pellucida of the egg. In the mouse, it has been shown
that a sperm surface galactosyl transferase is an adhesion
protein that functions in acrosome-intact sperm binding to
the zona (Shur, B.E., Galactosyl transferase as a
recognition molecule during fertilization and development,
In: "The Molecular Biology of Fertilization," Eds.
Schatten, H., and Schatten, G., Academic Press, pps. 37-71
(1989)). On rat sperm, there is a galactose receptor,
(RTG-r), related to the hepatic asialoglycoprotein
receptor, which could function through its lectin
properties in sperm binding to zona oligosaccharides
(Abdullah, M., and Kierszenbaum, A.L., J. Cell Biol., 108:
367-375 (1989)). A boar sperm plasma membrane protein
(APz), distinct from galactosyl transferase, and a rabbit
sperm protein have also been reported to have a role in
sperm-zona adhesion (Peterson, R.N. and Hunt, W.P., Gam.
Res., 23: 103-118 (1989) and O'Rand, M.G., et at., Dev.
Biol., 129: 231-240 (1988)).The guinea pig sperm surface protein PH-20 has been
shown to have a required function in sperm adhesion to the 
extracellular coat (zona pellucida) of the egg, a
necessary initial step in fertilization. In male and
female guinea pigs immunized with PH-20, 100% effective
contraception was obtained. Antisera from immunized
females had high titers, specifically recognized PH-20 in
sperm extracts and blocked sperm adhesion to egg zona
pellucida, in vitro. The contraceptive effect was long-lasting
and reversible; immunized females mated at
intervals of 6-15 months after immunization progressively
regained fertility. A second guinea pig sperm surface
protein, PH-30, has also shown a contraceptive effect.WO 92/10569 (international publication date 25 June
1992) discloses the DNA sequences of genes encoding guinea
pig, mouse and human PH-20 proteins. It was found that
