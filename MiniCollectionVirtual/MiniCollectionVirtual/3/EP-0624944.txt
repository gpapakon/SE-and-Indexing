<ABSTRACT>
An electronic apparatus comprising a plurality of 
loads, which are separately driven by a plurality of 

batteries, further comprises a switching device which 
automatically changes a system of connection between 

the batteries and the loads in accordance with the 
conditions of the electronic apparatus. Such 

conditions of the electronic apparatus include the 
remaining capacities of the batteries, load changes in 

the loads, and temperature changes in the electronic 
apparatus. An electronic apparatus provided with a 

system clock generating device and a peak load device 
comprises a system clock controller which suspends the 

supply of a system clock or divides the system clock 
while a peak voltage is being generated. A drive 

controller changes the connection between the first and 

second batteries in accordance with detected remaining 
capacities of the first and second batteries.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
apparatus, which uses a battery for a drive source, and
more particularly to a drive controller and an
electronic apparatus which are designed to perform
control so that batteries are efficiently used in the
electronic apparatus having a plurality of batteries.Conventionally, in an electronic apparatus, which
uses a battery for a primary power supply, is provided
with a plurality of batteries, and there are cases
where batteries supplied are changed in accordance with
the type of load or an operation mode of the electronic
apparatus.Fig. 17 is a block diagram which shows a schematic
configuration of a conventional electronic apparatus
with a backup memory. In the drawing, when a power is
turned ON by a switch, which is not shown, a voltage
from a main battery 102 is turned into a regular
voltage via a DC-DC converter 103 and supplied to a
main body electronic circuit 101, and at the same time,
the voltage, which has been turned into the regular
voltage, is also supplied to a backup memory 104. On the other hand, when the power is turned OFF
(at the time of backup) by the switch, which is not
shown, if the main battery 102 exists and a sufficient
battery capacity thereof remains, then the voltage,
which has been turned into the regular voltage via a
simple regular voltage circuit 105, is supplied from
the main battery 102 to the backup memory 104; if the
main battery does not exist or the battery capacity has
lowered, then the voltage from a backup battery 106 is
supplied directly to the backup memory 104. In
general, a dry cell or a secondary battery such as Ni-Cd
battery, nickel-hydrogen battery and a lithium ion
secondary battery is used for the main battery, while a
lithium battery is used for the backup battery.Fig. 18 is a block diagram which shows a schematic
configuration of another example of the conventional
electronic apparatus. This electronic apparatus is
provided with a plurality of batteries of the same
type, and the power supply which supplies power to a
main body 109 of the electronic apparatus is changed by
switching between the main battery 102, which is
identical to the one of Fig. 17, and a small auxiliary
battery 107 which generates the same voltage as the
main battery. In other words, the power supply is
configured so that the main battery 102 is normally
used and it is switched to the auxiliary battery 107
only when the capacity of the main battery 102 lowers 
or if a power failure occurs.Further, Fig. 19 is a block diagram which
