<ABSTRACT>
The temperature sensor comprises essentially an optical fibre (7) connected to a light source (1) and to a reflectometer (3). The temperature measurement zones (Z1, Z2,...Zn) consist of shape memory alloy components (4) producing a stress on the fibre in one of their memorized states.

Temperature sensor composed of an optical fibre
(2) interacting with a light source (1), a device (3)

for optically reading a variation in light flux F and
an element (4) made of a shape-memory alloy arranged on

the optical fibre, this element being designed and
taught so that when it is at temperatures lying on the

side of the transition temperature of the constituent
material it exerts virtually no stress on the fibre,

and when it is at temperatures lying on the other side
of the said transition temperature it exerts on the

fibre a stress which can be measured by the said read
device, characterized in that the sensor is a

multipoint sensor composed of several elements (4) made
of a shape-memory alloy which are distributed along the

optical fibre, each of the elements exerting, as
stress, a pressure that alternates spatially along the

fibre and in that the read device is of the time-domain
reflectometry (OTDR) type, determining the change in

the distribution of the paths of the light waves
propagating in the fibre, which change is due to the

periodic microbending induced by the said stress.
Sensor according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the spatial period of the sresses is calculated on

the basis of the difference between the propagation
constants of the high-order modes which propagate in

the fibre.
Sensor according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the element made of a shape-memory alloy has a

tubular helical shape. 
Sensor according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the element made of a shape-memory alloy has a

corrugated-concertina shape.
Sensor according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the element made of a shape-memory alloy is

composed of two corrugated plates (6, 7).
Sensor according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is composed of several

elements made of a shape-memory alloy having different
transition temperatures.
