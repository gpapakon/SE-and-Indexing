<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an absorbent body (3) which is intended to form the absorbent element in an absorbent article, such as a diaper, an incontinence guard or a sanitary napkin, and includes a first absorbent layer (16) which, in use, is intended to face towards the wearer, and a second absorbent layer (17) which is intended, in use, to face away from the wearer. According to the invention, the absorbent body (3) includes at least two mutually different cellulose fluffs, wherein the major part of the fibre structure of the first absorbent layer (16) is comprised of a first type of cellulose fluff having low liquid-spreading ability and a critical bulk which exceeds 8 cm

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent body intended to form the absorbent 
element of an absorbent article, such as a diaper, an incontinence guard or a sanitary 
napkin, the absorbent body including at least two mutually different cellulose fluffs 
and comprising a first absorbent layer which, in use, is intended to face towards the 
wearer, and a second absorbent layer which, in use, is intended to face away from the 
wearer, where the fibre structure of the first absorbent layer is generally comprised of 
a first type of cellulose fluff having an open structure and a low liquid-spreading 
ability, and where a major part of the fibre structure of the second absorbent layer is 
comprised of another type of cellulose fluff having a higher liquid-spreading ability 
than the cellulose fluff in the first absorbent layer, and where the second absorbent 
layer includes superabsorbent material. The invention also relates to a diaper including an absorbent body according to the 
invention and enclosed in a casing and which has a rear part which, in use, is intended 
to face rearwardly on a user, a front part which, in use, is intended to face forwardly 
on the wearer, and a crotch part which is located between the rear part and the front 
part and which, in use, is intended to be located in the crotch region between the 
wearer's thighs. An absorbent body, or absorbent pad, for use with absorbent articles, such as 
disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and incontinence guards, is normally comprised of 
one or more layers of cellulose fluff, and will more often than not include so-called 
superabsorbents, which are polymers capable of absorbing several times their own 
weight of water or body liquid. The absorbent body may also include other 
constituents, for instance constituents which will improve the liquid-spreading properties 
of the absorbent body, or constituents which will enhance the ability the 
absorbent body to hold together and to resist deformation during use.  
 One serious problem with present-day absorbent articles, and primarily in the case of 
diapers and incontinence guards which are intended to receive and absorbs relatively 
large quantities of liquid, is that the articles often leak long before their total 
absorption capacity has been fully utilized. One reason for this leakage is that those 
absorbent bodies known hitherto are unable to rapidly take-up and absorb large liquid 
quantities effectively.  
 Although an absorbent body which includes superabsorbents 
has a high
