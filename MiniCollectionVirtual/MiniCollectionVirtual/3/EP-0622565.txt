<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexing-contact-type 
gear drive, and particularly to tooth profiles of a 
rigid internal gear and a flexible external gear employed in 
this type of gear drive. A flexing-contact-type gear drive typically consists 
of a rigid circular internal gear, a flexible external gear 
which has 2n (n being a positive integer) less teeth than the 
internal gear and which is disposed inside the internal gear 
and flexed into an elliptical shape so as to mesh with the 
internal gear at two places, and wave generator fitted inside 
the external gear for flexing it. The basic tooth profile 
for the gears of a flexing contact gear drive is linear (see 
U.S. Patent No. 2,906,143). On the other hand, an involute 
tooth profile has also been proposed (see Japanese Patent 
Publication No. SHO 45-41171). However, where the linear or 
the involute tooth profile is adopted as that of each of the 
internal and external gears, the addendum faces of the gears  
 
cannot be continuously meshed with each other. For increasing load capacity the inventor of the 
present invention proposed in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 
SHO 63-115943 a system using as the basis for the tooth face 
profile the curve obtained by similarity transforming the 
locus of motion at a reduction ratio of 1/2 over a prescribe 
range from the meshing limit point on the locus of motion 
based on the rack approximation of the tooth of the external 
gear relative to the internal gear determined by the shape of 
the wave generator. With the tooth profile disclosed in this 
publication, the addendum faces of the internal and external 
gears can be continuously meshed with each other. In the meantime, as a flexing-contact-type gear drive, 
one having a cup-shaped flexible external gear has been 
known. If the internal and external gears of this type gear 
drive are designed to have the same tooth profiles as 
disclosed in the above Japanese Patent Laid Open No. SHO 63-115943, 
it cannot be realized to form a continuous meshing 
between the teeth of the gears all along the tooth trace 
direction. More specifically, in a cup-shaped, flexing-contact-type 
gear drive, the cup-shaped flexible external gear is 
subjected to deflection called coning, in which the deflection 
value of the external gear increases gradually in the 
direction from its diaphragm side to its opening side and in 
proportional to a distance from the diaphragm (the deflection  
 
being a difference in the length between the major axis and 
the minor axis of the

datum points (M) of tooth profiles of the gears (2, 3), or the tooth flanks of the both gears 
(2, 3) are defined by a tooth profile which is obtained by providing the composite tooth 

profile with a certain amount of escape.
