memory cell array (2), an address part (3 - 6) for 

supplying address signals to the memory cell array, a 
read/write part (7 - 12) for reading data from the 

memory cell array and writing data into the memory cell 
array, and an internal clock signal generating circuit 

(62) for generating an internal clock signal from an 
external clock signal. The internal clock signal has a 

cycle with an active-level portion of constant duration 
independent of a frequency of the external clock signal 

and is output, as a timing signal, to predetermined 
structural parts of the address part and/or the 

read/write part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
semiconductor integrated circuit devices, and more
particularly to a semiconductor integrated circuit
device that operates at a frequency controlled by a
clock signal externally supplied, such as a synchronous
dynamic random access memory (SDRAM).A synchronous dynamic random access memory
device (hereinafter referred to as a synchronous DRAM
device) operates at an internal frequency (internal
clock signal) controlled by an external clock signal
supplied from the outside thereof. The frequency of
the internal clock signal becomes lower (higher) as the
frequency of the output clock signal becomes lower
(higher). Generally, when the synchronous DRAM device
is operated at the maximum operating frequency, a
minimum amount of power is consumed. When the
synchronous DRAM device is operated at a frequency
lower than the maximum operating frequency, the
operating frequency of the synchronous DRAM becomes
lower than the maximum operating frequency and an
increased amount of power is consumed. As the
operating frequency (the frequency of the internal
clock signal) becomes lower, an increased amount of
power is consumed. As described above, the operating
frequency (the frequency of the internal clock signal)
is controlled by the external clock signal.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a semiconductor memory device that consumes a
decreased amount of power when the device is operated 
at a frequency lower than the maximum operating
frequency.The above object of the present invention is
achieved by a semiconductor memory device as indicated in claim 1. It
includes a memory cell array, an address part for
supplying address signals to the memory cell array, a
read/write part for reading data from the memory cell
array and writing data into the memory cell array, and
an internal clock signal generating circuit for
generating an internal clock signal from an external
clock signal. The internal clock signal has a cycle
having an active-level portion of constant duration
independent of a frequency of the external clock signal
and is output, as a timing signal, to predetermined
structural parts of the address part and/or the
read/write part.Other objects, features and advantages of the
present invention will become more apparent from the
following detailed description when read in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a synchronous
DRAM device related to the present invention;Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of parts of a
memo
