<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel acylaminosaccharide 
derivative which has an infection-preventive activity 
and/or a leukocyte-increasing activity and a process for 
preparing the same. It has been known that by enhancing functions in a living 
body of leukocytes, particularly those of neutrophils, 
macrophages and lymphocytes, a preventing activity of bacterial 
or fungal infections, an anti-tumor activity and an 
extensive immunological activity can be produced. As a compound showing such an activity, particularly an 
infection-preventive activity, there has been known, for 
example, a compound in which an N-acyl-N-alkylamino group 
is substituted at 1-position of a saccharide (Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 40036/1989). On the other hand, methyl 6-deoxy-2,3-di-O-methyl-6-methyl-acetamido-α-D-glucopyranoside 
is disclosed in "Carbohydrate 
Research", Vol. 45, pp. 65 to 72 (1975), but no pharmacological 
activity of said compound is disclosed.  The present invention is to provide a novel compound having 
an infection-preventive activity and/or a leukocyte-increasing 
activity, comparable to or more excellent than 
those of conventionally known acylaminosaccharide derivatives. The acylaminosaccharide derivative of the present invention 
is represented by the formula (I): 
   wherein R¹ represents hydrogen atom, or an aryl group 
or a heterocyclic group which may have a substituent; 
X represents a single bonding arm, an alkylene group, 
an alkenylene group or an alkynylene group; R² represents 
(1) hydrogen atom, (2) an aryl group or a 
heterocyclic group which may have a substituent, (3) 
an aryl lower alkylcarbamoyl group which may have a 
substituent, (4) carbonyl group which is substituted 
by a group obtained by eliminating a hydrogen atom 
from amino group of an amino acid or an ester thereof,

represents a single bonding arm, an alkylene group 
which may have a cycloalkylene group at an end thereof,
