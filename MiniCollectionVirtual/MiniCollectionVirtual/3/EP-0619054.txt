<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and a method for 
provision of diversity in reception for a communications 
system such as the GSM cellular radio system. It is a problem in radio systems such as the GSM 
cellular radio system operating at frequencies of the order 
900 MHz that a signal propagates from a transmitting unit to 
a receiving unit over a number of paths and, at the receiving 
unit, it exhibits multi-path fading. It is observed that if two or more receive antennas are 
provided, separated in distance, supplying signals to 
separate received channels, then the fading of the various 
channels is more or less independent, i.e. it is unlikely 
that all channels will fade together. Techniques known as 
diversity combining make use of several received signals to 
improve the realised signal to noise ratio and hence improve 
the bit error rate. For example a typical dual diversity (2 
channel) system might offer an improvement in signal to noise 
ratio (SNR) of 10 dB. Motorola Technical Developments Bulletin Vol. 10, March 
1990, Schaumburg, Illinois pages 62-63, Tayloe "Space 
Diversity Hopper for Digital Data Transmission" describes the 
provision of space diversity hopping to obtain additional 
uncorrelated samples that are not in a fade, by switching 
between two or more antennae at the base site in a GSM 
system. Providing diversity is not without substantial cost. It 
is not possible merely to combine the main and diversity 
signals because they can interfere additively and 
destructively with equal probability. It is necessary to 
duplicate the receive circuitry including the receive 
amplifier and demodulator. It would be desirable to provide diversity without the 
additional cost of duplicated circuitry.  
 According to the present invention there is provided 
radio communications apparatus for receiving a plurality of 
calls comprising: a plurality of receivers tunable to a  
 
plurality of frequencies, first and second antennas, 
switching means for switching the plurality of receivers to 
selected ones of the first and second antennas and control 
means coupled to the plurality of receivers for tuning the 
receivers to receive calls, the control means comprising: 
means for identifying a received call of low quality received 
through the first of the antennas and through a first of the 
plurality of receivers, means for identifying a spare 
receiver that is not required for receipt of a call, means 
for causing the switching means to switch the spare receiver 
to receive the call
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Radio communications apparatus for receiving a plurality 
of calls comprising:
 
   a plurality of receivers (10-14) tunable to a plurality of 

frequencies,
 
   first and second antennas (15,16),
 
   switching means (19) for switching the plurality of receivers (10-14) 

to selected ones of the first and second antennas (15,16) and
 
   control means (20) coupled to the plurality of receivers (10-14) for 

tuning the receivers to receive calls, the control means (20) 
comprising:
 
   means for identifying a received call of low quality 

received through the first of the antennas and through a 
first of the plurality of receivers, means for identifying a 

spare receiver that is not required for receipt of a call, 
means for causing the switching means to switch the spare 

receiver to receive the call through the second antenna, 
means for tuning the spare receiver to the frequency of the 

call of low quality and means for diversity combining the 
calls through the first receiver and the spare receiver. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 for receiving a plurality 
of calls separated over different time slots in a time-division 

multiple-access communications system wherein the 
control means (20) are arranged to cause transmission of messages 

to remote units, to control those remote units for setting up 
of calls on selected time slots and wherein the control means (20) 

are arranged to distribute the setting up of calls over the 
different time slots so that, during below-saturation 

operation, spare receivers are available on the same time 
slots as calls of low quality. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the control means (20) 
comprise means for terminating a call on a time slot, means 

for identifying that a corresponding receiver has 
consequently become spare and means for matching that spare 

receiver with another call of low quality on the same time 
slot.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein the means for 
matching comprises means for identifying a call of 

satisfactory quality on the same time slot as the call of low 
quality and means for transmitting a message to a 

corresponding remote unit to cause that call to be moved in 
time to the time slot on which the terminated call resided, 

thereby creating a spare receiver on the time slot of the 
call of low quality. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the first and 
second antennas (15,16) are directional antennas extending over the 

same sector of a sectorized antenna. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the first and 
second antennas (15,16) are adjacent directional antennas of a 

sectorized antenna. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the means for 
identifying a call of low quality comprises means for 

determining that the call has a signal-to-noise ratio below a 
predetermined threshold. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the means for 
identifying a call of low quality comprises means for 

determining that the call has a bit error rate below a 
predetermined threshold. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the means for 
diversity combining the calls only combines the calls when 

they are determined as having signal-to-noise ratios within a 
predetermined range of each other. 
A method of reception of a call comprising the steps of:
 
   providing a plurality of receivers (10-14) tunable to a 

plurality of frequencies;
 
   providing first and second antennas (15,16);
 
   providing switching means (19) for switching the plurality of 

receivers (10-14) to selected ones of the first and second antennas (15,16);
  
 

   controlling the plurality of receivers (10-14) for tuning the 
receivers to set up channels to receive calls;
 
   identifying a received call of low quality received 

through the first of the antennas and through a first of the 
plurality of receivers;
 
   identifying a spare receiver that is not required for 

receipt of a call;
 
   causing the switching means to switch the spare receiver 

to receive the call through the second antenna;
 
   tuning the spare receiver to the frequency of the call 

of low quality;
 
   diversity combining the calls through the first receiver 

and the spare receiver.
