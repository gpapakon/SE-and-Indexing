<ABSTRACT>
A method of managing a telecommunication subnetwork system 
composed of a number of network elements coupled together through 

an optical medium to form a Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) 
ring. Each of the network elements receives upon initiation or 

reconfiguration and then stores an identical ring table or 
knowledge database that is composed of data in a predetermined 

format and structure. The ring table defines the ring type and 
ring identification, number of nodes, ring status, node 

identification, sequence, and status, and provides ring 
provisioning tables and embedded SONET ring path 

identification/status information. The ring table is utilized 
in each of the network elements for provisioning and other 

management type functions common within a SONET ring environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed in general to a 
telecommunication subnetwork system, and, more particularly, to 
a method of managing a SONET ring subnetwork through the use of 
a ring table that is embedded into each network element of the 
ring. In telephone communications in the past, voice/data was 
carried primarily over metallic media such as twisted pair and 
coaxial cable. Over metallic media, voice/data is transferred 
at a speed or line rate of various levels. For example, the 
human voice can be carried as a digital signal at a line speed 
of 64 kilobits per second (kbps). For this line speed, the voice 
signal must be sampled 8,000 times each second, and using pulse 
code modulation, each voice value is carried as an eight-bit 
sample. This 64 kbps rate is called the Digital Signal level 0, 
or DS-0, rate. Higher rates, such as DS-1, DS-2, DS-3, ... DS-N 
also exist, and are described in the International Telegraph and 
Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) Recommendations G.703. 
However, the speed at which data is transferred over metallic 
media is limited. To overcome this limitation, optical fiber 
media have been developed, which can accommodate much higher line 
speeds, and hence can transfer much more information in a given 
period of time. The development of optical fiber transmission systems 
resulted in the Synchronous Optical NETwork or SONET standard, 
which is a Northern American version of SDH (Synchronous Digital 
Hierarchy). SONET defines a line rate hierarchy and frame  
 
format, and is fully described by the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) specification for a high-speed digital hierarchy 
for optical fiber communications in ANSI T1.105 and T1.106. The SONET line rate hierarchy is based upon transmission 
building blocks of 51.84 million bits per second (Mbps) each. 
The 51.84 Mbps rate is called the Synchronous Transport Signal 
level 1 (STS-1), which is the basic logical building block. 
Higher rates or levels are all multiples of the basic rate of 
51.84 Mbps, for example, the STS-3 rate is 155.52 Mbps. In 
general, the different line rates of the electrical signals are 
referred to as an STS-N rate. The different line rates of the 
optical signals corresponding to the electrical signals are 
referred to as OC-N. The frame format for STS-N line rates is derived from a 
basic unit of transport for the STS-1 frame, which is organized 
into nine rows of 90 bytes or 810 bytes per frame. Each frame 
is generated 8,000 times per second (8 KHz), yielding
