<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metallocenes. In another
aspect, the present invention relates to the polymerization of olefins
using metallocenes. In still another aspect, the present invention relates
to novel olefin polymers prepared by polymerization using metallocenes.
More particularly, the present invention relates to certain bridged
bis(1-methyl-fluorenyl) sandwich-bonded metallocenes.It is well known that many metallocenes can be useful for the
polymerization of some olefins. Particularly it has been noted that
metallocenes can be combined with aluminoxanes to produce catalyst systems
of high activity for the production of polyolefins. A particularly 
interesting type of metallocene for olefin polymerization is the so-called
bridged sandwich-bonded metallocene in which the ligand of the metallocene
comprises two cyclopentadienyl-like groups connected through a bridging
group. Some of the bridged sandwich-bonded metallocenes when used in the
polymerization of olefins having three or more carbon atoms have been found
to be useful for producing polymers having different types of
microstructure as reflected by tacticity determined by spectroscopic
techniques such as infrared and NMR. A discussion of such techniques is
disclosed in Zambelli et al, J. Polym. Sci. Part C, 84, 1488,(1962); Lotz
et al, Macro Molecules, 21, 2375, (1988); Haftka et al, J. Macromol. Sci.
Phys., 830, 319,(1991); and Youngman et al, Macromol. Res., 2, 33 (1967).It is well known in the art that the microstructure tacticity of
a polyolefin molecule can have a significant effect upon the physical
properties of the polymer. Other things which affect the polymer
properties include the type of monomer, and comonomer if employed, the
weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer, the molecular weight
distribution, and the composition distribution of the resin. Accordingly,
for producing commercially desirable polymers, it is important to find
metallocene catalysts which give the desired combination of polymer
properties plus commercially practical polymerization activities.Many sandwich-bonded bridged metallocenes have been at least
proposed in the open literature and the patent literature and there have
been some studies of the effects of varying the structure of the ligand
used in the metallocene. One example of such a study is disclosed in the
New Journal of Chemistry, Vol. 14, No. 6-7, pages 499-503 (1990). While
the patent literature contains broad assertions regarding the particular
types of polymers that will be
