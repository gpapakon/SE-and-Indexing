<ABSTRACT>
A buffer comprises a plunger (13) slideable in a ported tube (26). A metal tubular member (46) circumferentially surrounds that part of the ported tube (26) in which all the flow resisting ports (49) are formed and is the radially inner wall of an annular space (53) filled with compressed gas. The outer wall of the annular space (53) is formed by a tubular membrane (51). The annular chamber (50) between the ported tube (26) and the metal tubular member (46) is part of the low pressure reservoir of the buffer and communicates via an annular passage (48, 48A) in the closed end (11) of the buffer with the remainder of the reservoir which is an annular chamber (54) formed between the tubular membrane (51) and the outer tubular wall (10) of the buffer. Heat generated by forcing the liquid through the flow resisting ports (49) during compression of the buffer is carried by liquid flow from the radially inner annular chamber (50) to the radially outer annular chamber (54) via the annular passage (48, 48A) and is dissipated from the radially outer annular chamber (54) through the external tubular wall (10) of the buffer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A BUFFERDESCRIPTIONThis invention relates to a buffer comprising a plunger and cylinder unit, the plunger being forced into the cylinder when a load is applied to the buffer whereby liquid is displaced from a compression chamber within the cylinder into a relatively low pressure reservoir through flow resisting means which provide dynamic resistance, there also being an enclosed body of compressed gas which provides a recoil force opposing inward movement of the plunger with respect to the cylinder by acting to urge liquid in the reservoir into the compression chamber through said flow resisting means. Such a buffer is referred to as "a buffer of the kind referred to" in the remainder of this description.US-A-4153145 discloses a different type of buffer comprising a plunger and cylinder unit, the cylinder being formed by a ported tube, the ports of which are at axially spaced locations along the tube, and the plunger being forced into the cylinder when a load is applied to the buffer whereby liquid is displaced from a compression chamber within the cylinder into a relatively low pressure reservoir which surrounds the tube, the radially outer wall of the reservoir being formed by external structure of the buffer so that heat is dissipated from liquid in the reservoir through that external structure, resilient means being 

 provided for providing a recoil force opposing inward movement of the plunger into the cylinder.GB-A-864703 discloses a vehicle shock absorber comprising a piston and cylinder unit with an annular low pressure reservoir around the cylinder. There is a radially deformable annular membrane which, together with part of the external surface of the shock absorber, encloses a body of compressed gas which acts through the membrane to urge liquid in the cylinder to oppose inward movement of the plunger. Heat can be dissipated from liquid in the reservoir through the remainder of the external surface of the shock absorber. That would be insufficient for the amount of heat dissipation required for industrial uses because the heat dissipating area is small. It is also unsuitable for industrial uses because there would be a risk of deterioration of the material of the membrane and because the body of gas and the membrane which separate liquid in the reservoir from the external surface of the shock absorber have a heat insulating effect so they oppose heat dissipation.One object of this invention is to provide a buffer of the kind referred to which is suitable for continuous use. That requires

CLAIMS
1. A buffer comprising a plunger and cylinder unit, the cylinder comprising a ported tube, the ports of which are formed at axially spaced locations along the tube, the plunger being forced into the cylinder when a load is applied to the buffer whereby liquid is displaced through said ports which collectively comprise flow resisting means which provide dynamic resistance, from a compression chamber within the cylinder into a relatively low pressure reservoir which comprises an annular chamber which circumferentially surrounds the tube, the number of ports in direct communication with said pressure chamber reducing as the plunger moves into the cylinder, there being a body of compressed gas enclosed within an annular enclosure which also surrounds the ported tube and which comprises an annular radially deformable membrane arranged to provide a recoil force opposing inward movement of the plunger with respect to the cylinder by acting to urge liquid in the reservoir into the compression chamber through said flow resisting means, wherein a part of the reservoir is bounded by structure which forms an external surface of the buffer which is arranged so that liquid displaced from the compression chamber through the flow resisting means is directed to said part of the reservoir so that heat can be dissipated from that liquid through said structure which forms an external surface of the buffer, characterised in that said annular enclosure is spaced from said structure which forms an external surface of the buffer and is within said reservoir, being between said part which 


 is bounded by said structure which forms an external surface of the buffer and another part which is formed between it and the outside of the ported tube, and passage means wholly contained within the structure of said buffer provide coπaπunication between said part of the reservoir which is bounded by said structure which forms an external surface of the buffer and the other part between the ported tube and said annular enclosure.
2. A buffer according to claim 1, wherein the enclosure comprises a tubular member of substantially rigid gas impervious material and said radially deformable membrane, the tubular member being between the ported tube and the radially deformable membrane and the gas being enclosed within a space between the tubular member and the radially deformable membrane.
3. A buffer according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the plunger has a piston head which slides within the bore of the ported tube and which is formed by a ring which is mounted on an axially inner end portion of the plunger for limited axial displacement relative to the remainder of the plunger, there being passage means through said inner end portion of the plunger extending between an orifice at the inner end of the plunger and an opening which is closed by the ring when the latter is at the end of its limited axial ' displacement further from said inner end of the plunger and which is opened by displacement of the ring relative to the remainder of the plunger towards said inner end of the plunger, the diameter of the remainder of the plunger between said ring and the outer end of the plunger being less than the inside 



diameter of the ported tube so that an annular space is formed therebetween.
