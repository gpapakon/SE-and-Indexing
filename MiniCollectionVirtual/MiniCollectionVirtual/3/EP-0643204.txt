<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic honeycomb catalytic converter having 
a novel canning structure capable of stably retaining a 

thin-walled ceramic honeycomb catalyst (12) within a metal 
casing (11) for a long period. A retainer member in the form 

of a ceramic fiber mat (13) is disposed between an inner 
peripheral surface of the casing and an outer peripheral 

surface of the honeycomb catalyst, in a compressed state 
to generate a surface pressure for retaining the 

honeycomb catalyst in place. The ceramic fiber mat is 
composed of heat resistant and non-intumescent ceramic 

fibers, and has a compression characteristic which is 
substantially free from a significant increase or 

decrease in a practical use temperature range of the 
catalytic converter. The casing may be provided with at 

least one locking member (14,15) for locking the ceramic fiber 
mat in a flow direction of exhaust gas passed through 

the honeycomb catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic honeycomb catalytic converter which is suitable for use in an exhaust
gas clarification system of an internal combustion engine for vehicles.More particularly, the present invention pertains to a ceramic honeycomb catalytic converter which comprises a
metal casing, a ceramic honeycomb catalyst accommodated in the casing, and a retainer member in the form of a
ceramic fiber mat disposed in a compressed state between an outer surface of the honeycomb catalyst and an inner
surface of the casing, thereby generating a surface pressure for holding the honeycomb catalyst in place within the
casing.As known in the art, ceramic honeycomb catalytic converters of the kind mentioned above include a ceramic honeycomb
catalyst wherein a number of flow channels having a polygonal cell-like cross-section and extending longitudinally
through the honeycomb catalyst are defined by a peripheral wall and partition walls arranged inside of the
peripheral wall. Conventional arrangements of such ceramic honeycomb catalytic converters are disclosed, for example,
in JP-A-57-56,615, JP-A-61-241,413, JP-A-1-240,715, JP-U-55-130,012, JP-U-56-67,314 and JP-U-62-171,614.Such ceramic honeycomb catalytic converters have become widespread primarily due to a high open frontal area
of the ceramic honeycomb catalyst and a resultant low pressure drop when exhaust gas is passed through the flow
channels in the honeycomb catalyst, making it readily possible to achieve an excellent exhaust gas clarifying performance.
As a typical example, an advanced ceramic honeycomb catalyst used for practical purposes has a partition wall
thickness or rib thickness of approximately 0.170 mm and a flow channel density or cell density of 60 cells per unit
cross-sectional area of 1 cm2.In accordance with a recent enhancement in the exhaust gas regulation as related to environmental problems, e.
g., a requirement for reduction in the total emission amount of hydrocarbon in the LA-4 mode which is one of exhaust
gas evaluation test modes in the United States, there is a strong demand for an improved ceramic honeycomb catalyst
which is capable of achieving a distinguished exhaust gas clarifying performance as compared to conventional honeycomb
catalysts. Specifically, in an operational state immediately after starting an engine, i.e., in the so-called cold
start state, the exhaust gas clarifying efficiency undergoes a considerable deterioration because the catalyst is still not
much warmed and hence it is not sufficiently
