<ABSTRACT>
A fabric backing which may be used in manufacturing tufted carpets, which is comprised of woven silica fibres impregnated with a stabilising amount of acrylic resin which can be penetrated by needles during tufting and retain its dimensional stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NEW AND IMPROVED BACKING FOR CARPETS AND THE LIKEThis invention relates to a fabric backing suitable for use in manufacturing tufted textile materials such as carpets and in particular carpet tiles. The present invention will be discussed in reference to carpets and carpet tiles. However, the principles are equally applicable to other tufted textile materials such as fabrics used in wall coverings, seat coverings and the like, as will be appreciated. The invention should not be taken as restricted to its application to carpets and carpet tiles.A large number of carpet tiles are sold each year. They are generally comprised by a thermoplastic backing into which the carpet yarn such as wool is tufted. Traditional thermoplastic backings include polypropylene or polyester fibres which can be in the form of solid sheets or woven material but generally are comprised of a non-woven random layered web of thermoplastic material partially melted to provide a backing sheet material.Needles are used to force the yarn through the thermoplastic backing.It is common then to apply a support layer comprised of fibreglass in the form of a non-woven random layered sheet. The fibreglass sheet is generally coated with a binding material such as a polyvinylchloride resin or the like. The carpet is then cut into tiles. It has been found that carpet tiles so produced tend to lift at the edges particularly after printing. The edges curl upwards to make the floor unattractive and the tiles unacceptable. It has been practice to apply adhesive to keep the tiles flat to the floor. Similar problems arise with other tufted fabrics.In the past it has been practice to deform carpet tiles mechanically to stretch the backing layer thereby to keep the tile flat. This is a labour 

 intensive procedure and even so does not preven sufficiently the tendency of the tile edges to lift.Over the years many attempts have been made t solve the problems believed to be inherent in th manufacture of tufted fabrics but without success.The present invention provides a fabri backing for tufted textile materials such as carpe tiles and other carpets that allows for the manufactur of tufted products that have acceptable dimensiona stability and flatness such that for example the carpe can be laid onto floors without the need for adhesives.The invention is based on the realisation tha the penetration of the thermoplastic backing material b tufting needles introduces dimensional instability into the backing causing shrinkage to occur during subsequent

 CLAIMS:
1. A penetrable fabric backing material comprising a woven silica fabric having warp and weft threads, said fabric being impregnated with a lubricant comprising a stabilising amount of polyacrylic or polyacrylate resin, whereby to bind said warp and weft threads to stabilize said woven fabric to allow penetration by needles during a tufting process while said fabric remains sufficiently flexible to allow it to pass around rollers in a manufacturing process.
2. A fabric as claimed in claim 1, wherein said fabric is a woven fibreglass fabric.
3. A fabric as claimed in claim 2, wherein said fabric is comprised of woven fibreglass thread of between 40 and 80 tex.
4. A fabric as claimed in claim 3, wherein said fabric is of a single warp and single weft construction.
5. A fabric as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 4, wherein said fabric has a thread density of between 5 and 7 threads per centimetre, warp and weft and a woven weight of between 80 and 150 grams per square metre.
6. A fabric as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein an aqueous emulsion of resin is employed.
7. A fabric as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein said resin is one or more polymer or copolymer of acrylic acid, an acrylic acid ester or methacrylic acid ester.
8. A fabric as claimed in claim 7, wherein said polymer or copolymer has a molecular weight of between 50,000 and 250,000 and a viscosity in the range of from 50 to 100 cps.
9. A tufted textile material including including a fabric backing as claimed in any preceding claim,
-
'
tufted with yarn using tufting needles, a support layer and a binding layer therebetween.
10. A textile material as claimed in claim 9, wherein said support layer is a web of non-woven fibreglass. 


11. A textile material as claimed in claim 9 o claim 10 wherein said binding layer is polyvinylchloride binding layer.
12. A carpet comprised of a tufted textil material as claimed in any one of claims 9 to 11 in th form of a carpet strip.
13. A carpet comprised of a tufted textil material as claimed in any one of claims 9 to 11 in th form of a carpet tile.
