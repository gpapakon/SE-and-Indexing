<ABSTRACT>
1. A proces for the end contacting of electrical capacitors, in which a thin first end-contact layer consisting of a higher-melting metal and a second end-contact layer consisting of a lower-melting metal are sprayed onto the end faces of a capacitor, the higher-melting first metal layer contacting the respective edges of a coating, and in which a connecting wire is embedded in the second contact layer, characterized in that, after the application of the first metal layer (2), the respective connecting wire (4) is placed thereon and a predetermined quantity of a melt of the lower-melting metal is intermittently sprayed onto the connecting wire (4) and the region of the first metal layer (2) surrounding it.
