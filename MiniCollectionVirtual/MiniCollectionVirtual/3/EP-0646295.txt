<ABSTRACT>
A cable sealing device, which comprises: (a) a housing (3, 4) into which the cable (2) passes; (b) a sealing material (10) that seals a gap between the cable (2) and the housing (3, 4); and (c) means (12, 13) for transmitting an axial force in the cable (2) to the housing (3, 4) other than through the sealing material (10); in which the means (12, 13) allows substantially radial movement of the cable (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article for forming a cable 
seal, in particular for forming a ready access butt closure or an in-line 
closure for a telecommunications or other cable splice. It may 
however be used for forming a cable feedthrough. Cable splices have to be sealed against the environment to 
prevent damage to the cable conductors and connectors joining them, 
When a cable splice is made, cable jacket is stripped back from the 
ends of the cables to be spliced to expose the conductors to be 
connected. After the splice is made a so-called splice case, or splice 
closure, is built up around the splice. In certain instances it is desirable for the splice to be of butt, 
rather than in-line configuration. This means that two or more 
cables lying side-by-side with their ends pointing in the same 
direction are spliced together. An advantage is that a housing 
comprising a domed cover can be slid over the resulting splice. A 
single seal then has to be made where the cables leave an outlet of 
the housing. In the case of an in-line splice (made between ends of 
cables that face one another) two seals need to be made, one at each 
end of a generally cylindrical housing that surrounds the splice. 
Also, the housing of a butt closure need not be of the wrap-around 
type and can still be removed. Various cable splice closures have been proposed in the past, a 
few of which will be reviewed below. US 4194082 (Campbell) disclosed a generally dome-shaped 
closure having a heat-shrinkable end that is shrunk down around an  
 
ingoing cable. As a result of heat-shrinkage, a seal is made around 
the cable, isolating the inside of the closure from the environment. WO 90/05401 (Raychem) discloses an in-line splice closure that 
can avoid the use of heat-shrinkable materials. A sealing material, 
for example a gel, is provided as part of end seals that seal gaps 
between in-going and out-going cables of a splice case, a central part 
of which comprises a generally cylindrical housing. The end seals 
comprise the gel between structures that can be brought together to 
deform the gel to seal it to the cables and the central housing. US 4701574 (Shimirak et al) also discloses a closure which 
includes a cable end seal and a central generally cylindrical housing. 
The end seals have an outer convoluted surface that mates with a 
convoluted surface of the cylindrical housing. In this way the end 
seals are retained in appropriate positions at the ends of the housing. US 3984623 (Worden) discloses a cable
