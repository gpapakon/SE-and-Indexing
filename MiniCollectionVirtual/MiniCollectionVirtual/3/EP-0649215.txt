power converter apparatus, which effectively suppresses 

surge voltage, caused by stray inductance of the internal 
wiring, with conductor bars and snubber capacitors 

connected between DC input terminals. 
Pairs of positive and negative terminals 2, 3 (2, 3) are 
arranged on the edge portions of the left and right sides 

of a rectangular upper face of the package 1, of a semiconductor 
apparatus for converting DC input to AC output, into which 

a plurality of semiconductor chips are incorporated, with 
the positive terminals 2, 2 and the negative terminals 3, 3 

opposed facing to each other respectively. AC output 
terminals 4 are aligned on one of the other pair of the 

sides (upper side) and control terminals 5 on another side 
of the other side pair. Straight conductor bars 12, 12 are 

externally connected above the upper surface of the package 
1 between the positive terminals 2, 2 and between the 

negative terminals 3, 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
apparatus for power conversion such as a VVVF inverter. A configuration of a semiconductor apparatus according 
to the prior art is shown in Fig. 3 and an inverter circuit 
of the semiconductor apparatus is shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 
3, reference numeral 1 designates a package the faces of 
which are rectangular; 2 a positive DC input terminal (P); 
3 a negative DC input terminal (N); 4 AC output terminals 
(U, V, W); and 5 a control terminal of a semiconductor chip 
(IGBT for example) mounted in the package 1. The terminals 
2, 3, 4 and 5 are distributed on the upper face of the 
package 1 as illustrated in Fig. 3. In the package 1, a 
switching semiconductor chip is mounted as shown in Fig. 4 
which is comprised of six pairs of an insulated gate  
 
bipolar transistor (IGBT) 6 and a free wheeling diode 7 
which form a three phase bridge circuit. In Fig. 4, 
reference numeral 8 designates a rectifier circuit of a DC 
power supply, and 9 a motor which is connected to the AC 
output side and controlled at variable speed. The speed of the motor 9 is adjusted by variably 
controlling the voltage and the frequency of the AC output 
from the AC output terminals 4 with the IGBTs 6 switched on 
and off at an appropriate timing. When a main circuit current flows from the DC side to 
the AC side via the IGBTs 6 or from the AC side to the DC 
side via the IGBTs 6 and the free wheeling diodes 7 by the 
switching of the IGBTs 6, stray inductance 10 (inductance 
value L) of internal wiring on the DC side causes surge 
voltage L Ã— di/dt, because variation rate of the current 
di/dt, in association with high speed switching of the 
IGBTs 6, of internal wiring on the DC side is high. The 
surge voltage is added to the DC input voltage and the 
constituent elements of the chip are broken down when the 
surge voltage exceeds the withstand voltage of the chip. To 
solve this problem, snubber capacitors 11 for surge 
suppression are connected between the positive and the 
negative DC input terminals 2 and 3 as shown in Fig. 4 to 
suppress the surge voltage caused by the stray inductance  
 
10 of the internal wiring. In the surge voltage protection circuit shown in Fig. 4, 
the snubber capacitor 11 connected between a pair of the DC 
input terminals 2, 3 on the far side (right hand side of 
the figure) from the DC power supply show less surge 
suppression than the of the capacitor 11 connected between 
a pair of the DC input terminals 2, 3 on the near side to 
the DC power
