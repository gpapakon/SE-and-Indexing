<ABSTRACT>
For a method for the metering of fuel to a diesel internal combustion engine with an electronic injection pump and a lambda probe acted upon by the exhaust gas, it is proposed that at a load point the effective fuel injection quantity be determined from the existing lambda actual value and an intake air mass actual value, and that this value determined be related to the fuel injection quantity value determined in the injection pump in order to form a signal for the correction of the fuel injection quantity.

A method for metering fuel to a diesel internal combustion engine 

wherein a value for injection quantity established in a characteristics 
map is specified to an injection pump of the internal combustion 

engine as a function of operating state and operating characteristics, 
with 
load-dependent injection quantities influenced through a lambda probe 
impinged upon by the exhaust gas of the diesel internal combustion 

engine, 
 
characterised in that 


at one load level the effective injection quantity is established from 
the available lambda actual value and an intake air mass actual value, 

and 
this established injection quantity value is compared to the injection 
quantity which is especially determined through a speed-dependent 

quantity regulating unit setting to form a correction signal, by means 
of which 
a deviating injection quantity attributable to the injection system 
and/or fuel is corrected. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that dynamic rates of 
change in an operating characteristic such as engine speed occurring during 

establishment of the different injection quantity values of a load level and  
 

the subsequent formation of correction values are compared over a predetermined 
time period with a pre-established maximum rate of change, and 

the formation of the correction values is interrupted if the maximum rate of 
change is exceeded. 
A method according to claim 1 and claim 2, characterised in that values 
deposited in a characteristics map for desired injection quantities can be 

overwritten with corrected injection quantity values. 
A method according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that corrected 
injection quantities are used at l
ow to middle partial loads and air masscontrolled 
exhaust gas recirculation. 
A method according to claims 1 to 4, characterised by the use at full load 
to limit injection quantities.
