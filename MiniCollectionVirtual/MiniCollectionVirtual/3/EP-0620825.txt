<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to peptides from the
three type I repeats of human endothelial cell
thrombospondin, which binds to sulfated glycoconjugates
including heparin and sulfatide.Heparin binding is critical for activities in many
cellular growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, a
certain enzymes involved in the blood clotting cascade.
Agents to inhibit these interactions have found numerous
uses in prevention of thrombosis. Heparin analogues have
been shown to have anti-tumor and antimetastatic
activities.Peptides that bind to heparin have been identified
or isolated from many heparin binding proteins (see, for
example Cardin et al, Arteriosclerosis, Vol. 9, pages 21-32
(1989)). Examples of heparin binding peptides
identified from adhesion molecules include type IV
collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. All have clusters of
basic amino acids which fit consensus sequences defined
by comparison of many heparin binding proteins (see
Cardin et al, as above). The binding constants of the
Cardin et al peptides and other peptide described in this
art area are in the general range of 104 to 103 molar-1. Peptides from malaria circumsporozoite protein have
been disclosed to mediate cell adhesion (Rich et al,
Science, Vol 249:1574-1577, (1990)). Such peptides
suffer from the disadvantages of not binding heparin and
the adhesion activity was ascribed to a sequence Val-Thr-Cys-Gly,
which is inactive for heparin binding. Peptides
from thrombospondin have been disclosed (Prater et at, J.
Cell Biol. Vol 112, pages 1031-1040 (1992)). The
sequences of Prater have a significant disadvantage since
they are insufficient to bind to heparin or related
sulfated glycoconjugates with high affinity.Accordingly, there is a need in the present art for
highly potent peptides that will bind to heparin or
related sulfated glycoconjugates with high affinity.
There is particularly a need for such peptides which are
also useful to prevent interaction of heparin or related
sulfated glycoconjugates with adhesion molecules, growth
factors, cells or heparin-dependent enzymes. EP-A-443,404 relates to specific fragments and analogues of human
thromobspondin, together with the use of these compounds to inhibit
tumour metastasis and wound healing. This document teaches that at least
a portion of the C(S,N)(v,T)(T,S)C(G,S), particularly the sub-sequence
CSVTCG is required. The sequences of EP-A-443,404 are not described
as having heparin-binding activity.Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to overcome the difficulties in
