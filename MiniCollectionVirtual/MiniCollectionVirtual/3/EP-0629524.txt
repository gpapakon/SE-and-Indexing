<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle lift for stowing beneath the floor of a vehicle 
includes rails (83, 84) in which can move structure (11). A platform 

(27) is pivoted to the outer pivots (23a, 24a) of two parallelogram 
arrangements (20) whose inner pivots (23, 24) are with structure (11). 

A ram (34) is pivoted between the structure (11) and structure 
including plates (30, 31) pivoted at (32, 33) on axis (34) to the 

structure (11). The pivots (32, 33) are coaxial with pivots (23) and 
the ram is pivoted to plates (30, 31) at a location spaced from axis 

(34). The platform can be raised and lowered when the lift is not 
stowed. Arrangements are described in which the lift is stowed in an 

inclined position; in which the platform can form a step; in which the 
para
llelograms are modified to alter the inclination of the platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to vehicles and vehicle lifts, according
to the characteristics of the preambles of independent claims 1 and 10.US-A-3498481 shows a lift for a truck which comprises an inner
mounting structure and an outer lift platform, the outer lift platform being
deployable for operation between a raised position and a lowered position by
means comprising a parallelogram arrangement, said parallelogram
arrangement having a first upper side element and a second lower side
element, said first and second side elements having an inner pivotal
connection with said platform, said parallelogram arrangement being modified
such that said inner pivotal connection and outer pivotal connection define
unequal spacing therebetween. This provides for the platform to be
upwardly inclined towards its outer end in the raised position and
downwardly inclined towards its outer end in the lowered position.DE-A-3531853 is considered to disclose the closest prior art and
discloses a vehicle lift having a platform slidably movable between inner and
outer positions with respect to the vehicle and capable also of being raised
and lowered on pivotal elements with respect of the vehicle. However, the
platform consists of inner and outer pivotally connected parts which are
folded in superimposed relationship in an inner stowed position and must be
unfolded before the platform can be raised or lowered. This arrangement
requires a complex and expensive structure from the point of view of
manufacture and maintenance. Also strength and rigidity are reduced when
compared to a single rigid platform, and there may be a tendency for small
undesirable movements between the inner and outer platform parts when
under load. Other devices are known in which a manoeuvrable platform
includes means acting as a roll stop to prevent articles from rolling off the
platform when it is raised above the ground. Such means are not disclosed
in the aforementioned documents.According to the present invention there is provided a vehicle
lift mounted to a vehicle for transporting a person having limited mobility
comprising an inner mounting structure and an outer lift platform, the inner
mounting structure being coupled to an outer support structure, the platform
being deployable for operation between a raised position and a lowered
position by means comprising a parallelogram arrangement having first upper
side elements and second lower side elements, said first upper side elements
and said second lower side elements having inner pivotal

position; characterised in that said outer support structure is
comprised of elongated members (40, 41) attached to the vehicle

wherein the inner mounting structure (11) is moveable in a
horizontal sliding movement within said outer support structure

(40, 41) between an inner position and an outer position and the
movement of pivotal part (114) being activated by engagement of

at least one ground engaging means (131) with the ground surface.
