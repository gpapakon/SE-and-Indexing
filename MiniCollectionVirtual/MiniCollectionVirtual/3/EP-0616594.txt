<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus intended for transferring bulk in a transfer step substantially in a single transfer direction (s) from a first point (I) to a second point (II). The bulk (1) to be transferred includes a transverse and rigid transmitting surface (2) and a connecting surface (3), providing a connection with transmitting surface (2) substantially through the interior of bulk (1), and the bulk is transferred or carried by means of a transfer mechanism (4), operating between first and second (I, II) points and including a contact element (5), rotating around its longitudinal axis (a) and provided with a first component (5a) located at a constant distance from its longitudinal axis (a), and a bearing surface (6), located in its longitudinal direction substantially parallel to transfer direction (s) and bearing said bulk (1) during the course of its transfer. Upon carrying bulk (1) by means of transfer mechanism (4) in accordance with the invention, its transmitting surface (2) in communication with said first component (5a) of contact element (5) in a manner that said first component (5a) extends through said connecting surface (3) substantially into the interior of bulk (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
transferring boxes or cases by means of a screw or helical 
guide from a first location to a second location, wherein said 
boxes are partially supported by a bearing surface and are 
moved by means of a rotational force-transmitting contact, 
exerted on the boxes by the screw or helical guide. Such method is known from GB-A-797,685. According to this 
method the boxes to be transferred rest with their bottom 
surface on the blades of a rotatable helical conveyor, the 
pitch distance of these blades being greater than the vertical 
dimension of the boxes. The bearing surface is constituted by 
the blades of the conveyor. The boxes may be closed on all 
sides during the transfer. The object of the invention is to provide a method for 
transferring boxes or cases, enabling the use of a screw or 
helical guide, the pitch distance of which is much smaller 
than the dimension of the boxes in the direction of transport. According to the invention the method is characterized 
in that the boxes are provided with at least one partially 
open side through which the screw or helical guide extends 
into the interior of the boxes so as to engage with at least 
one force-transmitting surface which is oriented substantially 
transverse to the direction of movement.  
 Preferably the screw or helical guide engages with an 
edge portion of the force-transmitting surface of the boxes, 
which edge portion is the most distant one from a floor section of the 
bearing surface. When the bearing surface makes a small angle with a 
horizontal plane the screw or helical guide exerts a positive 
transferring force on the boxes to be transferred. If the 
bearing surface is arranged substantially vertically, the 
transferring force is delivered by gravity, in which case 
energy is saved and the gravitational traveling speed of the 
boxes is reduced by means of operating elements capable of 
decelerating the rotating motion of the screw or helical guide 
caused by the gravitational movement of the boxes. The method according to the invention and an embodiment 
of an apparatus for applying said method will now be described 
with reference to the drawing in which 
Fig. 1 shows a front view of an apparatus for applying a 
method of the invention, Fig. 2 is a side view of the same apparatus, and  
 fig. 3 shows a detail explaining the operating 
principle of the invention. An apparatus applying a method of the invention is 
intended for carrying objects like boxes or cases (hereinafter
