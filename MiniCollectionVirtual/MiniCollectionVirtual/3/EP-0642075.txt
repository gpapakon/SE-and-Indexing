<ABSTRACT>
For the purpose of bringing a cursor into an area of the image displayed on a screen, the method according to the invention uses a mode of displacement including the determination and indication on the screen of the direction and of the sense of relative displacement which it is wished to make, this step being executed by varying the orientation of the pointer (C) through a first manual control action so as to obtain the desired direction, the relative displacement of the cursor (C) with respect to the image, in the direction and sense which are thus determined until it reaches the said area, this displacement being made through a second control action distinct from the first and the validating of the position occupied by the cursor relative to the image, through a third control action distinct from the first two. The invention applies equally well to the conventional management of a cursor, to the plotting of the route of an aircraft or even to the multidirectional scrolling of an image on a screen.
