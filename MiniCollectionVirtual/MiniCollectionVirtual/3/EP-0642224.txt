<ABSTRACT>
An input transition detection circuit for detecting when an 
input signal switches states, the input transition 

detection circuit then providing a time delay signal at a 
time delay signal node to enable a zero-power part to wake 

up from a low power mode. The input transition detection 
circuit (400) includes two inverters (402, 404) and four 

transistors (406, 408, 410, 412) compared to the two 
inverters and nine transistors utilized in previous 

circuits. The two inverters (402, 404) are coupled in 
series for receiving and delaying the input signal. A first 

p-channel transistor (406) has its source coupled to 
receive the input signal and gate coupled to the output of 

the two inverters (402, 404). A second p-channel transistor 
(408) has its source coupled to the output of the two 

inverters (402, 404) and gate coupled to receive the input 
signal. A first n-channel transistor (410) is coupled to 

the drain of the first and second p-channel transistors 
(406, 408) and provides a current sink which draws less 

current than either the first or second p-channel 
transistors (406, 408) providing a voltage to control the 

gate of a second n-channel transistor (412). The second n-channel 
transistor (412) connects the time delay signal 

node to ground. The second n-channel transistor (412) 
enables the input transition detection circuit (400) to be 

faster than previous circuits since only one transistor 
(412) connects the time delay signal node to ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an input transition 
detection circuit for detecting when a signal input to 
a zero-power part switches states, the input transition 
detection circuit then providing a signal to wake up the 
zero-power part from a low power mode. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to circuitry 
for implementing an input transition detection circuit 
which can be utilized in a zero-power programmable logic 
device (PLD). Electronic circuits in battery powered devices such 
as notebook computers need to utilize as little power as 
possible to preserve the batteries for an extended 
period of time. Even with devices which are not battery 
powered, it is desirable to have electronic circuits 
which operate with as little power consumption as 
possible to conserve energy, thus reducing operational 
costs. More recently manufacturers have developed 
specialized electronic parts, called zero-power parts, 
for use in battery powered devices such as notebook 
computers. The zero-power parts have a low power 
consumption mode, also referred to as a sleep or standby 
mode, which is entered when the zero-power part has not 
been accessed for a period of time. During the sleep or 
standby mode, every circuit in the zero-power part will  
 
be turned off, only to be turned back on, or waked up, 
after an input transition signal is received. An input transition detection circuit is utilized on 
the zero-power part to detect any input switching and 
send a signal to wake up, or power up, a part from a low 
power mode. The signal provided by the input transition 
detection circuit is a time delay signal enabling the 
zero-power part to reenter a sleep mode after the time 
delay. An example of a zero-power part currently available 
is the AmPALCE22V10Z-25, a programmable array logic 
(PAL) device, a type of PLD, manufactured by Advanced 
Micro Devices, Inc. The AmPALCE22V10Z-25 is also 
available in a non zero-power version which provides 
faster operational speeds since the part does not 
require time to be powered up from a sleep mode. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing components of the 
AmPALCE22V10Z-25. The AmPALCE22V10Z-25 has an input 
port labeled I, ten ports which can be configured to be 
input or output ports labeled I/O, and a port which can 
be configured to be a clock or an input port labeled 
CK/I. The ports, when configured as input ports, 
receive and transmit an input signal to an input buffer 
of the input buffers labeled 100(a-l). The input 
buffers enable the
