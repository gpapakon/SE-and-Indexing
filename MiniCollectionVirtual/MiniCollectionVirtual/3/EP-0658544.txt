<ABSTRACT>
2,2'-Dinitrodiphenyl disulphide is obtained in a simple manner in particularly good yields and particularly good purity when 2-chloronitrobenzene is reacted with an aqueous alkali metal disulphide solution in the presence of phase transfer catalysts and an organic solvent.

Process for preparing 2,2'-dinitrodiphenyl disulphide 
by reaction of 2-chloronitrobenzene with an 

aqueous alkali metal disulphide solution in the 
presence of phase transfer catalysts, characterized 

in that the reaction is carried out in the additional 
presence of an organic solvent. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts are used as 

phase transfer catalyst. 
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that from 0.001 to 0.2 molar 

equivalent of phase transfer catalyst, based on 2-chloronitrobenzene, 
is used. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that dipolar, aprotic solvents are used 

in amounts of from 10 to 20% by weight, based on 2-chloronitrobenzene. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that alcohols or water-miscible ketones 

are used in amounts of from 50 to 100% by weight, 
based on 2-chloronitrobenzene. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized  
 

in that when using alcohols or water-miscible 
ketones the reaction is carried out at 

temperatures in the range from 20°C to the boiling 
point of the solvent at atmospheric pressure and 

when using dipolar, aprotic solvents the reaction is 
carried out at temperatures between 20 and 100°C. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that 2-chloronitrobenzene, solvent and 

phase transfer catalyst are initially charged, this 
mixture is heated while stirring to the desired 

temperature and the alkali metal disulphide solution 
is then added dropwise. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that from 5 to 20% by weight of the 2-chloronitrobenzene 

to be reacted are initially 
charged together with the organic solvent and the 

phase transfer catalyst, and the remaining amount of 
2-chloronitrobenzene and the alkali metal sulphide 

solution are then metered in simultaneously but 
separately from one another. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 

in that 2-chloronitrobenzene and alkali 
metal disulphide are used in a molar ratio of from 

1.7 to 3:1. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the aqueous alkali metal sulphide 

solution is used in a concentration of from 2 to 
4 mol per litre of solution.
