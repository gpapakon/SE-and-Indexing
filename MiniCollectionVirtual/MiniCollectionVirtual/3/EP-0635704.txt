<ABSTRACT>
The sensor comprises a photomultiplier detector (20) having selective response in the ultraviolet range and an optical filtering assembly. The filtering assembly comprises a tinted glass filter (26) for blocking the visible spectrum, a filtering crystal (28) having an intense absorption band beyond 340 nm and a complementary filter for selective absorption of energy between 290 and 340 nm, for example an interference filter working under normal incidence or a thin film of cermet.

A selective sensor of ultraviolet radiation in the 
solar absorption range, comprising a photomultiplier 

detector having a selective response in the ultraviolet 
and an optical filter assembly having a selective 

response in the ultraviolet and placed in front of the 
detector, the assembly comprising: 


a glass filter dyed in the mass for blocking 
radiation in the visible range of the spectrum, 
a crystal filter having an intense absorption band 
at least beyond 340 nm and extending at least as far as 

400 nm, and 
a complementary filter for selective absorption of 
energy in a range extending at least from 300 nm to 

340 nm. 
A sensor according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the complementary filter is a ceramic-metal sheet 

between 500 nm and 5 microns thick and made of 
particles of metal such as aluminium mixed with a 

dielectric such as alumina, the size of the metal 
particles being such that the sheet causes blocking 

beyond 300 nm. 
A sensor according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the metal is aluminium and the dielectric is 

alumina, the proportion of aluminium being a few 
percent.  

 
A sensor according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the metal is magnesium and the dielectric is 

magnesium fluoride, the proportion of magnesium being a 
few percent. 
A sensor according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the complementary filter is an interference filter 

operating at near-normal incidence and deposited on a 
curved surface or preceded by a telecentric optical 

system. 
A sensor according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the filter crystal is a crystal 

of nickel sulphate hexahydrate having a thickness 
between 8 and 100 mm. 
A sensor according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the dyed glass filter is a Wood 

glass filter. 
A sensor according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the detector is a light 

intensifier followed by a CCD camera or a 
photomultiplier. 
A sensor according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the dyed glass filter and the 

crystal filter have parallel surfaces or form lenses.
