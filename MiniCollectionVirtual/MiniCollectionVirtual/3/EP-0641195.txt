Process for producing a medicine with delayed action of an 
effective constituent, in which 


(a) an effective constituent is finely distributed; 
(b) an effective constituent in finely distributed form is 
mixed both with a finely distributed, high-melting lipid or 

lipoid constituent and with a finely distributed low-melting 
lipid or lipoid constituent, whereby a weight ratio 

of twolipid or lipoid constituents lies in a range of from 
1:5 to 5:1; 
c) a resulting mixture of an effective constituent and 
lipid or lipoid constituents is brought to a temperature 

which is over a melting-point of a low-melting constituent, 
yet below a melting-point of a high-melting constituent, 

whereby an effective constituent and a high-melting lipid 
or lipoid constituent are uniformly dispersed in a fully 

melted low-melting lipid or lipoid constituent; 
d) a resulting mixture is cooled, after melting of a low-melting 
constituent, to below its melting-point; and 
e) a resulting mixture is granulated during or after 
cooling, whereby terms 'low-melting' and 'high-melting' are 

used in relation to each other without including any 
particular melting-point, 
 
wherein
  
 

a previously reduced and well mixed powder material in 
accordance with b) is introduced into an extruder, which is 

at a previously regulated temperature, by means of an 
extrusion screw and is thereby brought to a temperature in 

accordance with c) which is, at most, 4° C over a melting 
temperature of a low-melting lipid or lipoid constituent, 

and a mixture heated in this way is subjected to an 
extrusion process at a pressure of 200 to 600 kPa (N/m²), 

whereby a partly melted and thoroughly mixed material is 
extruded through a nozzle plate with a nozzle-diameter of 

1.2 to 4 mm and is then cooled and, where applicable, 
granulated, in accordance with d). 
Process in accordance with claim 1, wherein a temperature 
is from 1 to 4° C over a melting-temperature of a low-melting 

lipid or lipoid constituent, in accordance with c). 
Process in accordance with claim 1 and claim 2, wherein a 
temperature in accordance with c) is 1 to 3° C above a 

melting-temperature of a low-melting lipid or lipoid 
constituent. 
Process in accordance with claims 1 to 3, wherein a 
temperature, in accordance with c), is 1 to 2° C above a 

melting-temperature of a low-melting lipid or lipoid 
constituent. 
Process in accordance with claims 1 to 4, wherein a nozzle-diameter 
in a nozzle plate is in each case 1.2 to 4 mm. 
Process in accordance with claims 1 to 5, wherein a nozzle-diameter 
in a nozzle plate is in each case 1.3 to 3 mm. 
Process in accordance with claims 1 to 6, wherein a nozzle 
diameter in a nozzle plate is, in each case, 1.5 to 2 mm.  

 
Process in accordance with claims 1 to 7, wherein a 
melting-pressure of a process concerned is kept at 200 to 

600 kPa (N/m²).
