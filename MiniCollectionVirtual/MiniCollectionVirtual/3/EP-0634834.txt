<ABSTRACT>
The frequency of a resonant circuit (Q2, L0, C0, CX, Q3, Q4, R6) in the 
emitter path of an output transistor (Q2) is caused to vary linearly with control 

voltage (VIN). The control voltage is applied to a circuit that constrains the ac 
current through the resonant circuit to be supplied through the emitters of a two-transistor 

current steering circuit (Q3, Q4). The sum of the two transistor's dc 
emitter currents is constant while the dc current through one of the two transistors' 

emitters varies as the square root of the control voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to voltage controlled oscillators 
and, more particularly, to voltage controlled oscillators 
where the frequency deviation is required to be linear with 
respect to the control voltage. The modulation and demodulation of fm signals may employ 
an oscillator whose frequency varies with the modulating or 
control voltage. In order for the demodulated signal to 
faithfully reproduce the original modulation it is necessary 
to have the frequency vary linearly with the control voltage 
in both the transmitter and the receiver. Oscillators whose 
frequency variation is produced in accordance with a control 
voltage are called voltage controlled oscillators and many of 
these circuits employ a varactor diode as the voltage 
responsive variable reactance component. While the varactor 
diode is a popularly used element in such circuits, it is 
rather expensive and, in certain applications such as small, 
hand-held cellular telephones where only a low supply voltage 
is available, there may not be sufficient voltage available to 
permit the varactor diode to undergo a sufficient range of 
reactance variation to produce the desired frequency excursion 
of the oscillator. In addition, it is desirable to have the 
frequency excursion vary linearly with the control voltage. 
Accordingly, an alternative to the use of the varactor diode 
in voltage controlled oscillators circuits is desirable. The foregoing and other objects and features of my 
invention are.achieved in one illustrative embodiment in which 
the effective amount of capacitance present in the resonant 
circuit of a voltage-controlled oscillator is varied so that 
the resonant frequency varies substantially linearly with 
control voltage. A biasing circuit effects a current through  
 
one of a pair of paralled transistors in the feedback loop of 
a negative resistance oscillator that varies with the square 
root of the control voltage but in which the sum of the 
currents through the two transistors is constant. As current 
is divided between the two transistors in response to the 
control voltage, a variable fraction of the capacitance is 
effectively switched into and out of series with the 
capacitance of the resonant circuit causing its frequency to 
vary with the control voltage. Fig. 1 depicts the circuit which shifts a variable 
fraction of the current passing through a series resonant 
circuit through a further capacitor in accordance with a 
control voltage applied to the circuitry of Fig. 2; Fig. 2 shows the details of
