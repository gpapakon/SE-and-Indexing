<ABSTRACT>
The metallic inner socket (1) can be inserted in the inner cavity of an outer socket (2) and can be fastened by the fastening element (8) on the outer socket (2). This results in a two-part acetabular prosthesis (3). At the same time, support regions of the inner socket 1 are approximately positioned in a groove 11 in the outer socket 2, and the inner socket 1 is thereupon displaced by a pivoting movement into the outer socket 2, so that the support regions come to rest completely in the groove 11 and the fastening element 8 assumes the position shown. The gap between the inner socket (1) and the outer socket (2) thus narrows in the direction of the direction of tightening (13), so that the fastening element (8) is wedged by its head (9) between the boundary surface (1i) of the inner socket (1) and the groove (11) in the outer socket (2) when it is tightened in the direction (13). At the same time, a play is preferably provided between the internal screw thread (7a) and the external screw thread (8a) such that the force transmission area (9b) of the head (9) comes to rest against the boundary surface (1i) of the inner socket (1) on tightening of the fastening element (8) and the force transmission area (9a) comes to rest against the groove (11) in the outer socket (2). Thus, the inner socket (1) is wedged in the outer socket (2) in that the fastening element (8) transmits a force between inner socket (1) and outer socket (2), in particular radially to the axial direction (10).

Inner shell (1) for a hip joint socket (3), wherein
the inner shell (1) can be assembled with a metallic

outer shell (2) to form a hip joint socket (3), and
wherein the inner shell (1) is formed as a hemi-spherical

shell having a pole (4) and an axial direction
(10) extending through the pole (4), characterized

in that the inner shell (1) is made of metal, in
that the inner shell (1) has, in the region of the

equator, at least two support regions (6) on its outer
surface (1a) distributed over the circumference, which

extend radially to the axial direction (10) beyond the
outer surface (1a) in such a way that, in the assembled

hip joint socket (3), the support regions (6) can
seat in a groove (11) of the inner surface (2b) of the

outer shell (2), in that the inner shell (1) has an
aperture (7) in the region of the equator with a direction

of extension (12), in that the aperture (7)
serves for the receipt of a fastener element (8), and

in that, with an inner shell (1) inserted into the
outer shell (2), the fastener element (8) is actuatable

in such a manner that the fastener element
(8) can produce an effective connection to the inner

surface (2b) of the outer shell (2) in order to wedge
the inner shell (1) in the groove (11) of the outer

shell (2) in the equatorial region by means of at
least three effective connections.
Inner shell (1) in accordance with claim 1, characterized
in that the support region (6) is formed by a

fastener element (8) with a head (9), wherein the inner
shell (1) has an aperture (7) for the receipt of

the fastener element (8). 
Inner shell (1) in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the inner shell (1) has a support

region (5) at its outer surface (1a) in the region of
the pole (4).
Inner shell (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the inner shell (1) has a

cylindrical protuberance (4a) at the pole (4) which
extends in the axial direction (10).
Inner shell (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the fastener element (8)

has an outer thread (8a) which engages in an inner
thread (7a) of the aperture (7).
Inner shell (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the guide surfaces between

the fastener element (8) and the aperture (7) are areally
formed.
Inner shell (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the angle between the axial

direction (10) and the direction of extension (12)
is larger than the angle between the axial direction

(10) and a lateral surface (11a) of the groove (11) of
the outer shell (2), so that the fastener element (8),

when moved along the direction of extension (12) in
the direction (13) of the outer shell (2), comes to

lie with its head (9) on the lateral surface (11a).
Inner shell (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the angle between the axial

direction (10) and the direction of extension (12)
is smaller than the angle between the axial direction

(10) and a lateral surface (11a) of the groove (11) of
the outer shell (2), so that the head (9) of the fastener 

element (8), when moved along the direction of
extension (12) in a direction (13) away from the outer

shell (2), comes to lie on the lateral surface (11a).
Inner shell (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1
to 8, characterized in that play exists between the

fastener element (8) and the aperture (7) so that, in
the fastened state, the fastener element (8) with head
