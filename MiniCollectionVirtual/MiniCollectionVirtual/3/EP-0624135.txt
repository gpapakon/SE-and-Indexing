Toothed rack auxiliary power steering mechanism, 
particularly for motor vehicles, with following features: 


a pinion (2) is rotatably mounted in a steering gear 
housing (1); 
a toothed rack (6) guided in the steering gear housing 
(1) so as to be axially displaceable is held in 

engagement with the pinion (2) by means of a spring-loaded 
pressure piece (7); 
a servo-motor (11) is connected to the toothed rack (6) 
in a motive manner for auxiliary power assistance; 
a control device (20) can be adjusted as a function of a 
movement of the pinion (2); 
the control device (20) contains two control valves (26, 
27) which are in the form of seat valves, 
 
characterized by following features: 


the pinion (2) is pivot-mounted in a fixed bearing (3) 
and in a movable bearing (4); 
the pivot point of the pinion (2) lies in the centre 
point of the fixed bearing (3); 
the control valves (26, 27) lie in the region of the 
movable bearing (4); 
the axes of the control valves (26, 27) are substantially 
perpendicular to the axis of the pinion (2); 
the movable bearing (4) is displaceable perpendicular to 
its axis only in the direction of the axes of the control 

valves (26, 27) and is guided so as to be displaceable in 
the steering gear housing (1) on its side opposite the 

pressure piece (7). 
Toothed rack auxiliary power steering mechanism according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that each control valve (26, 27) 

has an intake seat valve (28) and an exhaust seat valve (30). 
Toothed rack auxiliary power steering mechanism according 
to Claim 2, characterized  

 

in that the intake seat valve (28) is closed in neutral 
position of the control valve (26, 27) and 
in that the exhaust seat valve (30) is open in neutral 
position of the control valve (26, 27). 
Toothed rack auxiliary power steering mechanism according 
to Claim 3, characterized in that a closure body (32) of each 

exhaust seat valve (30) has a valve plunger (33) which rests 
on the external ring (8) of the movable bearing (4). 
Toothed rack auxiliary power steering mechanism according 
to Claim 4, characterized in that in the case of a steering 

movement and associated adjustment of the pinion (2) and of 
the movable bearing (4) in each steering direction the exhaust 

seat valve (30) is first closed and then the intake seat valve 
(28) is opened.
