<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention involves the use of selective H2
agonists, as erectogenic agents in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.The year 1982 marked the beginning of a new era in the diagnosis and treatment of
male sexual impotence. At that time, the new development was the use of papaverine as a
drug which, when injected intracavernously, was capable of inducing a penile erection in
humans, Virag, R. "Intracavernous injection of papaverine for erectile failure". Lancet 2:
938 (1982).Regrettably, universal medical experience with this drug over several years revealed
the severity of some of its side-effects, Jünemann, K.P. and Alken, P. "Pharmacotherapy of
erectile dysfunction; a review". Int. J. Impotence Res. 1, 71-93 (1988). A major
disadvantage of papaverine was the occurrence of unduly prolonged erection with the danger
of priapism. Papaverine was also tried in combination with the alpha sympathetic blocker
phentolamine, Zorgniotti, A. W. and Lefleur, R. S. J. Urol., 133(1): 39 - 41, (1985).
Phenoxybenzamine, another alpha-adrenergic blocker was also tested, Brindley, G. S. Br. J.
Psychiatry, 143: 332 - 337 (1983). The use of phenoxybenzamine for the management of
impotence was abandoned at this time because of evidence obtained from experiments with
animals suggesting that this drug could have carcinogenic activity. IARC.

receptor antagonist., Goodman and Gilman's. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,
eighth edition New York: Pergamon Press, c1990. p. 225.Experiments with Cynomolgus monkeys showed that after 1 to 2 weekly
intracavernous injections (of papaverine) led, after a period of 12 months, to extensive
fibrosis in the distal areas of the erectile organ. In humans, this reaction could have very
negative long term consequences: fibrotic corpora cavernosa become incapable of erection,
Abozeid, M. et al. J. Urol., 138(5): 1263 - 1266 (1987). In 1986, Ishii et al injected for the first time prostaglandin E1 into human corpora
cavernosa fur the treatment of organic impotence. Ishii, N. et al. "Therapeutic trial with
prostaglandin E1 for organic impotence", Jap. J. Imp., 1: 54 - 962 (1986). See also Ishii,
N. et al "Intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 for the treatment of erectile impotence",
J. Urol., 141(2): 323 - 325 (1989). Since it is a drug of natural occurrence in the body and
could be expected to cause fewer
