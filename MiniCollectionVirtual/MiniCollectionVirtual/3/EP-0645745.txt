<ABSTRACT>
A top part (7) depicting any desired theme is punched out of the surface of a card or of a placard. The rear part (3) is bent towards the rear around the bending edges (5) so that the card or the placard can stand with lower supporting edges (2, 4) on a base. Punched-out cutouts (8) serve to supplement the theme. The card or the placard can be printed and/or written on. It preferably consists of cardboard or another relatively stiff material. Cards of similar design are also suitable as creative name tags for inserting in breast pockets of jackets and shirts. The card or the placard is preferably depicted with the aid of a CAD system and a punching form, preferably made of wood, with blades inserted into incisions is then produced by means of a simple CIM system and the card is punched. This method can be implemented quickly and is economical. The punching form is subject to only slight wear.

<CLAIMS>
A card or placard having at least two edges (2, 4) for standing on
a base or for inserting the card, wherein the card or placard is

formed in one piece and comprises a front part (1), a rear part (3)
and a head part (7), openings (8) are provided in the front part (1),

the front part (1) and the rear part (3) are mutually bounded by at
least one folding edge (5, 6), the head part (7) is separated from

the rear part (3) by means of a continuous cutting edge (S) and is
delimited from the front part by the line defined by the folding

edge (5, 6) so that, after the rear part (3) has been folded over,
the head part (7) extends in the same plane as the front part (1).
A card or placard according to claim 1, characterised in that
further openings (8) are provided in the head part (7) and/or the

rear part (3).
A card or placard according to either one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the folding edge (5, 6) extends horizontally or

forms an acute angle with the horizontal.
A card or placard according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the openings (8) permit the incorporation and arrangement of

three-dimensional objects. 
A card or placard according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

A method of manufacturing a card or placard according to any
one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the card or placard with

the cutting edge (S) of the head part (7) and the openings (8) is
depicted with the aid of a computer, and in that, on the basis of

this depiction, a punching die is subsequently produced with
cutters inserted into incisions, and the card or placard is punched

out of a selected material. 
A method of manufacturing a card or placard according to any
one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the card or placard with

the cutting edge (S) of the head part (7) and the openings (8) is
depicted with the aid of a computer, and in that, on the basis of

this depiction, the cutting edge (S) and the openings (8) are
subsequently cut out by means of a laser beam or water jet or by

means of a numerically controlled nibbling machine.
A method of manufacturing the card or placard according to
either one of claims 10 and 11, characterised in that the cut-out or
