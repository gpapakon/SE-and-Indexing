<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steam generator for an iron, comprising a housing (4) containing a boiler (5) having a bottom (6), a side wall (7) and cover (8), the said bottom being equipped with an electrical heating resistor (9-13) determining a zone of intense heating, and the said cover having a filling orifice (10) communicating by means of a nozzle (11) with an aperture (12) made in the housing. According to the invention, the bottom (6) of the boiler has a region (14) forming a low point, arranged partially outside the zone of intense heating, and the filling orifice (10) is made above the said low point.

Steam generator for an iron having a casing (4) enclosing
a boiler (5) having a base (6), a side wall (7) and a cover

(8), the said base being equipped with an electrical heating
element (9-13) determining an intense heating area, and the

said cover having a filling orifice (10) communicating by
means of a nozzle (11) with an opening (12) formed in the

casing, characterised in that the base (6) of the boiler has a
region (14) forming a low point arranged partly outside the

intense heating area, and the filling orifice (10) is formed
above the said low point.
Steam generator according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the ba
se (6) of the boiler is arranged in a plane which
is inclined with respect to a horizontal plane so as to

constitute the low point (14) in the lowest part of the said
boiler, and the filling orifice (10) is arranged at a point in

the peripheral region of the cover (8) situated above the low
point (14).
Steam generator according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the boiler is formed by two asymmetrical bowls, upper

(16) and lower (17), turned towards each other and connected
by their peripheral edges (18, 19), the lower bowl (17) being

mounted in the casing so as to place the base in an inclined
plane.
Steam generator according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised
in that the electrical heating element (9) consists of a cast

plate (13) extending partly over the entire base (6) so as to
form, in the lowest region of the boiler, the low point (14)

between the side wall (7) of the said boiler and the periphery
of the said plate (13).
Steam generator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the nozzle (11) has a lower

section (15) extending into the boiler beyond the orifice (10)
in the direction of the low point (14).
