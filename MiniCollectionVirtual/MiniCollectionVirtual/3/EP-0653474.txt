Process for preparing an abrasive based on corundum with a
grain shape factor, being calculated as relation of the

diagonals of an ellipse equal in area to the grain
projection, exceeding 0.6, comprising the following steps:


1.1. an Al
2
O
3
-containing starting component with an Al
2
O
3

content of 
>
98 wt.% is charged continuously or
batchwise into an electric arc furnace and is melted

there by the arc,
1.2. the amount of the starting component charged in per
unit of time and the furnace capacity are selected

to be such that a melt sump formed in the electric
arc furnace will never exceed a maximum of 200 mm

during the entire furnace campaign,
1.3. the solidified corundum ingot is subsequently removed
after the switch-off of the furnace and reduced to

the desired grain size.
Process in accordance with claim 1, provided that the
height of the melt sump is limited to 100 mm.
Process in accordance with claim 2, provided that the
height of the melt sump is limited to 50 mm.
Process in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 3,
provided that the Al
2
O
3
-containing starting component has
an alkali content of less than 0.1 wt.%.
Process in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 4,
provided that the Al
2
O
3
-containing starting component is
melted in a melting unit cooled on the wall and/or bottom

side. 
Process in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 5,
provided that a separating layer is placed on the bottom

of the melting vessel before the Al
2
O
3
-containing starting
component is charged in.
Process in accordance with claim 6, provided that a
corundum layer consisting of coarse lumps is charged in as

the separating layer.
Process in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 7, in
which an Al
2
O
3
-containing starting component containing up
to 3.0 wt.% of oxides of groups 2-6 of the Periodic Table

of Elements as additives is used.
Process in accordance with claim 8, in which TiO
2
 and/or
Cr
2
O
3
 are used as additives.
Process in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 9, in
which the electric arc furnace has a wall and/or bottom

section cooled on the outside, as well as a protective
plate on the bottom.
Process in accordance with claim 10, in which the wall
and/or bottom area is water-cooled.
Process in accordance with claim 10 or 11, in which a
graphite plate is used as the protective plate.
