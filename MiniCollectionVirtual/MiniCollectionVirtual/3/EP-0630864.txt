<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fabrication process 
of polarization-maintaining optical fiber. A polarization-maintaining optical fiber has such 
structure that near a core body to become a transmission 
path, there are stress-applying members based on silica 
glass doped for example with B₂O₃ having a larger thermal 
expansion coefficient than the core body whereby the core 
body receives a non-axial symmetry pulling stress. Thus, 
the core body will have equivalent birefringence because of 
these stresses to show excellent optical transmission 
characteristics. Conventionally known methods for fabricating such 
polarization-maintaining optical fibers are for example 
those as described in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 
No. 61-174135, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 1-153551, 
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 62-12625, 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-1252, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 63-28857 and U.S. Patent No.5,160,522. The present invention is directed to a polarization-maintaining  
 
optical fiber fabrication process for 
fabricating a polarization-maintaining optical fiber from 
a column preform in which a core body is buried in a 
cladding based on silica glass. A polarization-maintaining optical fiber fabrication 
process according to the present invention comprises at 
least six steps. A first step is of boring a through hole into the 
cladding away from the core and along the longitudinal 
direction of the core. A second step is of removing 
undesired impurities present on an inner surface in the 
through hole. A third step is of inserting a rod of a 
stress-applying members made of a material having a 
different thermal expansion coefficient from that of the 
cladding into the through hole. A fourth step is of sealing 
at least one end of the through hole formed in the cladding. 
A fifth step is of reducing the pressure in the through hole 
with the rod inserted therein down to a pressure lower than 
the atmospheric pressure. A sixth step is of drawing a 
preform for polarization-maintaining optical fiber formed 
at the fifth step. The second step comprises a surface treatment step for 
introducing a liquid which increases a width of a scratch 
(crack groove) formed on the inner surface in the through 
hole, into the through hole, and the liquid increases a 
surface roughness of the inner surface in the through hole.  A hydrofluoric acid solution (HF) is effective as the 
liquid which increases the width of a scratch formed on the 
inner surface, and
