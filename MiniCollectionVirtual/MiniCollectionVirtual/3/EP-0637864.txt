<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to raceways and 
particularly concerns a raceway assembly comprising a length of 
elongated conduit enclosing a plurality of continuous 
conductors. The raceway assembly of this invention is particularly 
advantageous in arranging for electrical and/or communications 
connection at selected positions along the raceway. The 
raceway is normally mounted either as an in-laid unit or along 
an exposed surface of exterior or interior panels, walls, 
ceilings or floors of structures such as buildings, mobile 
homes, airplanes, vans or other units having requirements for 
electrical and communications conductors in an integrated 
raceway assembly. Specifically, however, it is contemplated 
that primary use of the raceway assembly of this invention will 
be as a surface mounted unit on an interior wall such as along 
its base board, chair rail or cove molding adjacent a ceiling 
and would include outlets for both power and communications 
conductors permitting maximum efficiency in installation as 
well as ready modification to effect subsequent changeover to 
meet different power and communications requirements. Facing ever evolving design criteria, particularly in 
commercial and residential installations, whether new or  
 
renovated, the cost factor, particularly the labor costs of tradesmen involved, has 
presented a demand for minimal changes in traditional framing methods. The 
former practice of installing ducts or raceways within specially recessed channels 
in a wall, e.g., does not permit ready changeover of an existing structure into 
which power conductors are laid or drawn and onto which power outlets are 
attached to provide a distributed electrical power system or for the supply of 
cables or wiring for telecommunications, fiber optics, signal, control or data 
communications systems herein referred to collectively as communications 
systems. Another factor has become increasingly important in certain of the 
different applications to which such raceways have been conventionally used. 
This factor concerns discouraging tampering and minimizing ill-advised or 
undesired removal of a raceway cover from its base. Examples of prior art 
raceways can be found, for example, in US-A-3566566 and EP-A-0330082. Accordingly, a primary object of this invention is to provide a new and 
improved raceway assembly which does not require changes in traditional framing 
methods or special recesses to be formed in the structure on which it is mounted 
and is particularly suited to

<CLAIMS>
A wiring management assembly comprising 

a raceway (10) including an elongated surface-mountable base (12) and an 
elongated removable cover (14) for the base, the base being divided into first and 

second longitudinally extending raceway channels (18,20), the assembly being characterised by 
an elongated latching member (100) formed of a resilient, form-sustaining 
material with a length coextensive with that of the cover (14), the latching 

member (100) being removably engagable with the base (12) and its cover (14) 
continuously along coextending lengths of the latching member (100) and the 

cover, the latching member being positioned in interfering relation to cover 
movements required for removal of the cover relative to the base, whereby the 

latching member releasably secures the cover to its base in a latched position of 
the assembly. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the latching member (100) 
in said latched position requires a first maneuver of initially removing the latching 

member relative to the base and cover followed by a second maneuver of 
detaching the cover from the base in order to gain access to the first and second 

channels of the raceway base with its cover removed. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that electrical power conductors 
and communications conductors are respectively disposed within the first and 

second channels (18,20) of the raceway base. 
The assembly of claim 3, characterised by a first electrically conductive 
shield (30) mounted as a discrete element to the base to extend longitudinally 

through said first channel (18) of the raceway base in overlying relation to the 
power conductors for shielding the communications conductors from 

electromagnetic interference generated by AC power and other electrical  
 

disturbances transmitted along the power conductors and for establishing a ground 
connection to a service entrance. 
The assembly of claim 4, characterised by a second electrically conductive 
shield (32) mounted as a discrete element to the base to extend longitudinally 

through said second channel (20) of the raceway base in overlying relation to the 
communications conductors, the conductors within the first and second channels 

of the raceway base thereby being effectively isolated within the respective 
channels. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised by an accessory channel (94) 
formed in the raceway cover (14) and providing a multiple-use accessory 

compartment longitudinally extending along the cover. 
The assembly of claim 6, characterised by an elongated covering (96) 
provided for the accessory channel, the covering being removably fixed to the 

cover in overlying relation to the accessory channel (94). 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the latching member (100) 

additionally serves as a trim cover and is mounted on the base and cover to 
extend above the same, the latching member cooperating with the base and cover 

to define a third raceway channel. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the base (12) includes a 
generally flat, surface-mountable rear wall (34), and in that a projection (52) 

extends longitudinally along the base in outwardly protruding relation to its rear 
wall (34), the projection being engagable with the cover (14) to serve as a stop 

to maintain the cover in predetermined spaced apart relation relative to the base 
and to prevent undesired flexing of the cover relative to the base, while  

 
additionally serving as a partition within the raceway defining said first and 

second channels. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the base includes a 
generally flat rear wall (34) having a plurality of projecting ribs (46,48,50) 

thereon longitudinally extending along the base (12) for multiple-use applications 
in securing conductors, shielding, and wiring and communications device 

components in said first and second channels (18,20). 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the base (12) and the cover 
(14) are each formed of a resilient, form-sustaining material. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the base (12) includes a 
generally flat, surface-mountable rear wall (34) having integral upper and lower 

walls (38,40) projecting therefrom in generally perpendicular relation to the rear 
wall (34), the upper and lower walls each having an inwardly-turned tongue 

(42,44) directed toward the tongue of the other wall, the cover (14) including an 
inside wall surface (86) with a pair of spaced apart ribs (82,84) longitudinally 

extending along the cover (14) adjacent its upper and lower edges and forming a 
pair of outwardly opening latching retention grooves (88,90) thereon, the tongues 

of the base and grooves of the cover being interengageable for removably 
attaching the cover to the base in a ready position preliminary to being secured 

by the latching member in latched position. 
The assembly of claim 12, characterised in that the cover (14) further 
includes an upper latching lip (108) and underlying latching recess (110) formed 

in the inside wall surface of the cover, the latching lip and recess longitudinally 
extending along the cover with the latching recess disposed above the upper 

latching retention groove (88) of the cover, the latching member (100) having a  
 

surface-mountable rear wall (102) and integral trim face (104) projecting from the 
top of the rear wall, the trim face having a bottom edge formed by an offset 

latching foot (106) extending the length of the latching member, the latching foot 
being in abutting engagement with both the base and its cover in their ready 

position and wedged within the latching recess of the cover in said latched 
position of the assembly, thereby preventing undesired disassembly of the cover 

relative to the base. 
The assembly of claim 13, characterised in that the rear wall (34) of the 
base (12) and the rear wall (102) of the latching member (100) are in coplanar 

alignment when the assembly is in latched position. 
The assembly of claim 1, characterised in that the latching member (100) 
includes an offset toe (114) engageable with an upper rear edge of the base for 

cooperating in releasably securing the latching member in said latched position.
