<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a muffler device (silencer) characterised in that it comprises:     an external wall (10) which is vapourtight; a layer (12) of sound-absorbent material in the form of a tube located inside the said external wall and exhibiting an exterior wall facing the said external wall and an internal face; an internal wall (14) located facing the internal face of the layer of absorbent material and the length of which is greater than that of the said layer, the said internal wall being made of a flexible gastight material and having a small thickness to allow the acoustic vibrations of the flow of gas flowing through the said internal wall to be applied to the said absorbent layer;   means (16) for keeping the said internal wall in a given shape; a first joining end for securing the said internal and external walls; and   a second joining end for securing the internal and external walls.
