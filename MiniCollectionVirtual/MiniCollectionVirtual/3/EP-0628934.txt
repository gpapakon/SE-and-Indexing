A refunding lock for elements, such as shopping trolleys and
baggage trolleys, to be attached releasably to one another, said

lock having a lock casing (1) which is attached to the first
element and which is formed with an opening (1b, 1c) for the card

and an opening (la) for a coupling member and is attached to the
second element and is retained locked by a closure bolt until the

card is inserted, the card moving during its insertion a control
member (3) which moves the closure bolt (4) out of the locking

and into the unlocking position, characterized in that by the
insertion of the card a surface area (17, 21) of the card can be

deformed by the lock, and the deformed surface area or the
remaining, undeformed surface area moves the control member

directly or via an intermediate member.
A refunding lock according to claim 1, characterized in that
the area (17, 21) of the card actuating the lock can be moved out

of the plane of the card.
A refunding lock according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in
that the deformation of the deformable surface area (17, 21) is

facilitated by a recess (16), more particularly a slot which
adjoins the deformable surface area.
A refunding lock according to claim 3, characterized in that
the recess (16) opens into the edge of the card. 
A refunding lock according to claims 3 or 4, characterized in
that the two ends of the recess (16), more particularly the slot,

are situated at a distance from the edge of the card.
A refunding lock according to one of claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that the recess (16), more particularly the slot

terminates in a widening (19).
A refunding lock according to one of claims 3 to 6,
characterized in that the recess (16), more particularly the slot

encloses a tongue-shaped surface area (17).
A refunding lock according to one of claims 3 to 7,
characterized in that the slot (16) is disposed in the direction

of the sliding path of the card.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that disposed at the front edge of the card (10)

are two first zones, more particularly tongues (17) each of which
is separated by a slot (16) from the central second zone (18).
A refunding lock according to claim 9, characterized in that
the central zone (18) has a greater width than the width of the

first zone (17).
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the recess (16), more particularly the slot

bounds one or more teeth (17). 
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the recess (16), more particularly the slot

is zig-zag-shaped.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the recess (16), more particularly the slot

has one or more bends.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the deformation of the deformable surface

area (17) is facilitated by a groove-shaped recess which adjoins
the deformable surface area.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the deformation of the deformable surface

area (17) is facilitated by a softening of the material or a
reduction in its density.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the deformable surface area (17) is made

from a softer material, more particularly rubber, soft plastics
and/or cardboard, than the remaining area.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the deformable surface area (17) is

adjoined by a marginal area which is made from a softer material,
more particularly rubber, soft plastics and/or cardboard, than

the remaining area. 
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the deformable surface area (17) is

adjoined by a marginal area which has a smaller thickness than
the remaining area.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the area (21) which can be moved out of the

surface of the card can move springily.
A refunding lock according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the card can be checked in the lock by the

deformed or the undeformed surface area.
