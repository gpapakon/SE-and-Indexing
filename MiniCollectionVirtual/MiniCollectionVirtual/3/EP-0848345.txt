<ABSTRACT>
Coordinate information and writing speed information relating to
handwritten characters are acquired as three-dimensional time series

information. Input handwritten character data and registered handwritten
character data are corrected by dynamic processing matching through use of

warping functions which minimize a cumulative error between these sets of
data. The authenticity of the input characters is verified by means of the

degree of difference in the overall character patterns thus obtained by
comparison of the corrected sets of data with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signature verification method and to
an apparatus for verifying the authenticity of a signature made up of
handwritten characters.A handwritten character recognition method by which written
characters are recognized has been utilized as an input method for word
processors or a signature verification method for specifying a writer.Under a handwritten character recognition method which has already
been in actual use as an input method, characters are input in the block style
under specified constraints on the style of typeface, and the thus-input
characters are converted into coordinate information. The thus-converted
coordinate information is verified by comparison with coordinate information
relating to character data which have been stored beforehand. As a result of
verification, the characters are recognized as matched. If characters are
carefully written in the block style at comparatively slow speed in the
manner as previously described, the characters can be sufficiently recognized
through use of only coordinate information because under such conditions
each of the strokes of the characters becomes clear by virtue of visual
feedback to the writer and hence the shape of the characters becomes stable.In contrast, in a case where the character recognition method is
applied to an input method which does not pose any restriction on the style of
typeface at the time of input of characters or to a signature verification 
method, there must be recognized not only characters written in the block
type but also cursively written characters. When characters are cursively
written, writing motion becomes faster and does not involve any substantial
visual feedback to the writer. In this case, the characters become less
identifiable, and separation of a resultantly acquired pattern into strokes
becomes difficult. This is because an expansion or contraction of the pattern
in the direction of the time axis or in the direction of stroke, or the difference
between the input pattern and a pre-registered pattern, becomes greater.
For this reason, a matching rate is extremely low, rendering identification of
characters difficult.Another method is to enable recognition of characters without
involving the separation of characters into strokes by application of
coordinate information and writing pressure. This method employs a
pattern matching technique called dynamic programming (DP) matching,
which takes into consideration variations in the coordinate information
stemming from variations
