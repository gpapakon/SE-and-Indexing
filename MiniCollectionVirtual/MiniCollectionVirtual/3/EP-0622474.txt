<ABSTRACT>
According to the process, the substrate (2) is subjected to an electric discharge with a dielectric barrier, for example a discharge in the presence of an atmosphere containing silane, an oxidising gas, NO, N2O, CO2 or O2, especially, and an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen or argon. A controlled atmosphere is maintained about the electrode (6) used for the electric discharge, this atmosphere containing the silane and the oxidising gas in the immediate vicinity of the electrode, while preventing the process from being disturbed by atmospheric air entrained, for example, by the substrate (2) travelling through (3).

Process for creating a deposit of silicon oxide on a 
moving solid substrate, according to which the substrate is 

subjected to a dielectric barrier electric discharge in the 
presence of an atmosphere containing a silane, this atmosphere 

being at a pressure greater than 10 000 Pa, characterized in 
that there is circulated, in the zone where the electric 

discharge is produced, an atmosphere with a controlled 
composition containing a silane and oxygen or a gas capable of 

providing oxygen, as well as a carrier gas, and in that means
