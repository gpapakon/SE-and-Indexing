<ABSTRACT>
A spring actuated fastener driving tool has a lift pawl (110), 
bearings (128) for supporting the lift 

pawl (110) for pivotal movement about a first axis (AS) into and out of 
engagement with a power spring (102), 

and an operating handle (116) continuously engageable with the bearings 
(128) and intermittently engageable 

with the lift pawl (110). The operating handle (116) is supported by a 
housing (16a,16b) for pivotal movement about 

a second axis (AF,60) parallel to the first axis (AS) through successive 
driving cycles each including a loading 

phase during which the pawl (110) remains engaged with the power spring 
(102) as the power spring (102) is 

resiliently deflected and loaded, and a release phase during which the 
pawl (110) is disengaged from 

the power spring (102). The housing (16a,16b) and the operating handle 
(116) have guide surfaces (120,130) which coact in 

sliding engagement with the bearings (128) to accommodate movement of the 
bearings (128) towards a 

reference plane containing the second axis (AF,40) during at least the 
loading phase of the drive cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a spring actuated fastener driving tool with the features cited in the
preamble of claim 1.A spring actuated fastener driving tool of this type is disclosed in US-A-4,452,388.
Basically, this driving tool operates satisfactorily. During the movement of the handle, the
spring means is deflected and a pin which rotatably holds the pawl means moves along an
arc which initially extends upwardly and forwardly. The relatively high level of force required
to cycle the tool is of particular concern since it can result in worker fatigue and loss of
production efficiency.Another spring actuated fastener driving tool is disclosed in GB-A-646,222. This tool has a
handle which is pivotably mounted on a housing. A trigger lever is rotatably mounted on the
front end of the handle. The trigger lever has a hook which engages with a hammer 8 and
a rest position. The hammer 8 is connected to a driver element for ejecting the fasteners.
The hook portion engages the hammer in the above-mentioned rest position and
intermediate position. In the release position, the hook is deflected and releases the
hammer so that a vertically arranged actuating coil spring is allowed to exert its resilient
force on the hammer member to eject the fastener.It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved spring actuated fastener
driving tool of the above-mentioned type in order to achieve a beneficial reduction of the
force required in a fastener driving cycle without any lessening of the driving force being generated by the
tool.According to the present invention, this is attained by a spring actuated fastener driving tool
with the features of claim 1.Advantageous features and embodiments are cited in the dependent claims 2-14. In a fastener driving tool according to the present invention, lift pawls are pivotable about
a first axis into and out of engagement with a power spring assembly responsible for generating
the fastener driving force. The lift paws are in turn connected to an operating handle which is
pivotable about a parallel second axis through successive driving cycles, each including a loading
phase during which the pawls remain engaged with the power spring assembly as the latter is
resiliently deflected and loaded, and a release phase during which the pawls are disengaged from
the power spring assembly, thereby allowing the power spring assembly to act through an
associated driver to drive a fastener into or through a work surface. The first axis is defined
by a bearing which is
