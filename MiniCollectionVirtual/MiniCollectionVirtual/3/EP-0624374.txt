<ABSTRACT>
The use of sulodexide, a glycosaminoglycan of natural origin extracted 
from mammalian intestinal mucosa, and of medicines containing it in the 

treatment of patients suffering from nephropathy of diabetic origin 
constitutes the object of the present invention. 
The effectiveness of sulodexide has been shown by the significative decrease 
of the albuminuria in microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric diabetic 

patients treated with pharmaceutical compositions administered by oral or 
intramuscular route containing therapeutically effective amounts of drug.

<DESCRIPTION>
The use of glycosaminoglycans, and particularly of heparins, in
anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapies is well known.Sulodexide is a glycosaminoglycan of natural origin, extracted from
mammalian intestinal mucosa, possessing a sulfation degree and an
anticoagulant activity lower than those of heparin, as shown by
Radhakrishnamurthy B. et al., Atherosclerosis 31, 217-229, (1978). It is
marketed under the trademark VESSEL DUE FÂ® for the treatment of
vascular pathologies with thrombotic risk like periferal arteriopathies, as
shown by Crepaldi G. et al., Atherosclerosis, 81, 233, (1990),
cardiovasculopathies, as shown by Tramarin A. et al., Medical Praxis, 8
1, (1987), cerebrovasculopathies, as shown by Sozzi C., Eur. Rev. Med.
Pharmacol. Sci., 6, 295, (1984) and venous pathologies of the lower
limbs, as shown by Cospite M. et al., Acta Therapeutica, 18, 149, (1992).Kanwar Y.S. et al., Sem. Nephrol., 5, 307, (1985) and
Groggel G. C. et al., Kidney Int., 33, 517, (1988), recently produced
evidence of the probable role of glycosaminoglycans in helping the
integrity and the functioning of the renal cells.Moreover, Canfield J.P. et al., Lab. Invest., 39, 505, (1978),
previously showed a decrease of glycosaminoglycans of membrane in many
conditions of nephropathy, while Baggio B. et al., Nephron., 43, 187,(1986) showed this decrease through an increased urinary elimination of
glycosaminoglycans in diabetic, non-albuminuric, patients. This increased
excretion of glycosaminoglycans in diabetic nephropathies, shown also by
Partasarathy N. et al., Diabetes, 31, 738, (1982), recently suggested to
Gambaro G. et al., Metabolism, 38, 419, (1989), the possibility of
resorting to the determination of the amount of glycosaminoglycans
excreted by urinary route as an analytical method more reliable than the
microalbuminuria in the recognition of the nephropathy of diabetic origin.Lastly, Diamond J.R. et al., Renal Physiol., 9, 366, (1986)
and Parkerson M.B. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 81, 69, (1988), showed in
animals the potential protective effect of heparin and its derivatives in
models of experimental nephropathy not related to diabetic nephropathy,
like chronic nephrosis from aminoglycosides and renal pathologies
resulting from the subtotal renal ablation in the rat.Lastly, the possibility to use heparin, low molecular weight heparin
fractions, chemically modified heparins or low molecular weight dermatan
sulfate in the treatment of the diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy has been
described in the European patent
