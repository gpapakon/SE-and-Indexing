<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a luminous device (1) including at least one light-emitting diode (LED) (5), at least partially embedded in a solid translucent material. This translucent material includes particles which can diffract light, and a cohesion element. The invention also relates to the use of this device (1) for roadmarking and, in particular, for producing luminous road construction elements, such as luminous kerb elements.
