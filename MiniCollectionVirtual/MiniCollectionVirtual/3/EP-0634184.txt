<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for 
dislodging powder carried on the surface of a flexible 

sheet material. The device incorporates a resettable 
impactor including a head for striking the sheet 

material, wherein the head comprises an elongate

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dry powder inhalers and
in particular to dry powder inhalers in which powdered
medicament is carried on the surface of a flexible
sheet material prior to dispensing.Asthma and other respiratory diseases have long
been treated by the inhalation of appropriate
medicament. For many years the two most widely used
and convenient choices of treatment have been
inhalation of medicament from a drug solution or
suspension in a metered dose inhaler (MDI), or
inhalation of powdered drug and perhaps excipients
from a dry powder inhaler (DPI). With growing concern
being voiced over the damage done to the earth's ozone
layer by CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons) which are in
widespread use in existing MDI'S, heightened interest
in DPI systems has been stimulated.W090/13328 discloses a dry powder inhalation
device comprising a housing defining a chamber in
communication with a patient port in the form of a
mouthpiece or nasal adaptor, and an elongate carrier
bearing a powdered medicament, the device being
constructed and arranged such that areas of
predetermined size of the elongate carrier may
sequentially be exposed within the chamber, the device
comprising one or more air inlets such that when a
patient inhales through the patient port an air flow
is established from the air inlet(s) to the patient
port through the chamber such that particles of the
powdered medicament of respirable size from said
exposed area of the elongate carrier are entrained
within the air flow.The device generally comprises means to advance
the elongate carrier to expose an area of said carrier
within the chamber, said means being operable prior to 
or during patient inhalation through the patient port
and means for releasing medicament of respirable size
from the exposed area of carrier, e.g. in the form of
means for impacting or striking the exposed area of
the carrier either singularly or by a plurality of
such strikings or impactions.W092/08509 discloses a breath-actuated triggering
mechanism which is suitable for use in such a device
and WO-A-9 309 832 claiming the priority of GB Patent Application No. 9123953 discloses a
deagglomerator suitable for use with dry powder
inhalers.EP-455463 discloses the use of microdimpled
materials to hold doses of powdered medicament for
inhalation therapy. Such materials may be in the form
of an elongate substrate in which a surface of the
substrate comprises:
(i) one or more grooves of width 10 to 500µm at
the carrier surface and depth 10 to 500µm, the grooves
containing particles
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for delivering powder comprising a flexible
sheet material (27, 122) carrying a powder to be

delivered on a surface thereof, structure to support a
substantially planar portion of the sheet material and a

resettable impactor (32, 128) for dislodging said powder
from said portion of the sheet material, the impactor

comprising a curved head which is movable between a
first, primed position distant from said planar portion

of the sheet material, and a second position in which the
head impacts a substantially planar portion of said

flexible sheet material, the impactor being resiliently
biased to propel the head from said first towards said

second position, 
characterised in that
 the impactor (32,
128) comprises:


(a) a shaft (6) having a first end (2, 130) that is
mounted within the device, and
(b) a cantilevered arm (8, 138) extending from said
shaft terminating in a free end, said cantilevered arm

comprising the impactor head

wherein the movement of said shaft between said
first and second positions defines a plane of motion,
at least a portion of said cantilevered arm,
disposed intermediate (i) the intersection of said arm

with said shaft and (ii) said free end, extending out of
a first plane that includes said shaft and is

perpendicular to said plane of motion, towards a second
plane that is defined by said substantially planar

portion of said flexible sheet material,
a second portion of said cantilevered arm (8, 138)
between said intermediate portion and said free end

intersects said first plane, defining a curve,
and said free end extends out of said first plane in
a direction away from said second plane.
A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said curve of
the head has a radius of curvature of from about 10mm to

about 40mm. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein
said shaft and said cantilevered arm are formed from a

continuous piece of springing material.
A device as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said springy
material is spring steel.
A device as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the spring
steel has a circular cross-section having a diameter of

approximately 1mm.
A device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
said head is biased towards said second position by a

spring (4).
A device as claimed in Claim 6 wherein said spring
(4) is positioned adjacent said first end of said shaft

(2).
A device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
said cantilevered arm (8) extends at an angle of

approximately 90° with respect to said shaft.
A device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
said cantilevered arm (8) has a length of 15mm.
A device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
said sheet material is elongate and said support means

comprises a pair of support members (124, 126) disposed
in opposed spaced relation along the longitudinal axis of

said sheet material.
A device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
said head is biased towards said second position to a

sufficient extent so that when said head is released from
said primed position it moves towards said second

position at a speed of at least 10m/sec.
The device as claimed in any preceding Claim further
comprising a releasable latch mechanism (37, 162) for

retaining said free end in said primed position until
use of the device.
The device as claimed in Claim 12 further comprising
a reset member (40, 156) for returning said free end to

said first, primed position after use of the device. 
The device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the powder is micronised.
The device as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the powder is a medicament.
The device as claimed in Claim 15 wherein said
device is an inhaler.
The device as claimed in Claim 16 wherein said
device further comprises a housing having a mouthpiece

(22, 140) shaped and positioned for delivery of the
powder that is dislodged from the sheet to the mouth of a

user of the device.
The device as claimed in Claim 17 wherein said
device further comprises a cover (26, 154) that is

movable between a first position, in which it covers said
mouthpiece, and a second position in which it is clear of

said mouthpiece.
The device as claimed in Claim 18 further comprising
a releasable latch mechanism for retaining said free end
