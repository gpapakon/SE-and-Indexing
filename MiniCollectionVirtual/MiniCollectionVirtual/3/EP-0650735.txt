<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a novel kit or method for the
delivery of pharmaceutical or diagnostic compounds to

target cells in the body. This kit comprises a
monospecific antibody with multiple binding sites, which

antibody recognizes a target associated antigen, and a
ligand-effector moiety, of which the ligand has been

derived from the target associated antigen or analogue
thereof. Specifically the invention relates to targeting

cytotoxic drugs or radioisotopes to tumor cells. The
preferred antibody is a human IgM and the ligand is

preferably the epitope cognate to said antibody.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the fields of immunotherapy 
and immunodiagnostics, more particular to the field of 
pretargeting. The invention describes a kit and method for 
the delivery of pharmaceutical compounds or diagnostics to 
target cells in the body. These kits comprise an antibody 
or a fragment thereof, or a derivative of said antibody or 
fragment, which antibody or fragment recognize a target 
associated antigen, and a ligand-effector moiety conjugate 
comprising a ligand specific for said antibody, and an 
effector moiety linked to the ligand. The in vivo use of antibodies for the selective 
delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic agents to target 
tissues is known in the art. Since the advent of methodology for the production of 
monoclonal antibodies, antibodies of predefined 
specificities (Köhler and Milstein, Nature 256, 495-497, 
1975), numerous studies aiming at specific targeting of 
radionuclides, plant or bacterial toxins, biological 
agents and cytostatic agents (drugs) to target cells or 
tissues with the help of said antibodies have been 
performed, as reviewed by Bator and Reading (in: 
Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies, eds: C.A.K. Borrebaeck 
and J.W. Larrick, Stockton Press, pp. 35-56, 1990). In in vitro 
studies the great potential of these 
immunoconjugates has been amply demonstrated. Application 
of such immunoconjugates in vivo in tumor bearing animals 
as well as in cancer patients has met with much less 
success. A major problem has been the inability to attain 
a sufficient difference in uptake of the immunoconjugates 
between the target tissues as compared to the non-target 
tissues. As a result it has been difficult for instance to 
effect an increase in therapeutic index of clinically used 
anti-cancer drugs by administration in the form of a drug-immunoconjugate. 
Similarly, due to the lack of operational  
 
selectivity of therapeutic radio-immunoconjugates when 
administered in vivo, normal tissues are unduly exposed to 
destructive radiation. The therapeutic and diagnostic 
limitations of immunoconjugates, apart from a number of 
factors adversely affecting antibody delivery, are partly 
due to changes in antibody affinity, specificity and 
immunogenicity upon chemically linking a diagnostic or 
therapeutic agent to an antibody. In order to overcome part of the problems mentioned, 
newer approaches to delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic 
agents have recently been suggested, that are 
characterised in that the localisation phase of the 
antibody component is
