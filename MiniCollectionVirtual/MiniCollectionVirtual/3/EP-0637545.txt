<ABSTRACT>
Supply hopper for delicate, rod-shaped products, 
in particular in cigarette packaging machines, which 

hopper (1) is provided in its lower part with a plurality 
of separate discharge channels (2), each of which is 

divided by means of intermediate walls (4) into several 
ducts (3) which are vertical and parallel to one another, 

in each of which ducts (3) there is formed at least one 
substantially vertical row of cigarettes (S) which are 

superimposed on one another, whereas above the upper end 
(104) of each intermediate wall (4) there is provided a 

roller (6) which is horizontal and parallel to the axis 
of the cigarettes (S) in the hopper (1), and is rotated, 

preferably with oscillatory motion. According to the 
invention, in order to prevent to a large extent the 

formation of bridges of cigarettes which block the ducts 
(3), the rollers (6) are disposed quincuncially relative 

to a horizontal plane, i.e. they are alternately offset 
parallel to one another upwards and downwards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a supply hopper, in particular 
in cigarette packaging machines, which hopper is provided in 
its lower part with a plurality of separate discharge 
channels, each of which is divided by means of intermediate 
walls into several ducts which are vertical and parallel to 
one another, in each of which ducts there is formed at least 
one substantially vertical row of rod-shaped products which are 
superimposed on one another, whereas above the upper end of 
each intermediate wall there is provided a roller which is 
horizontal and parallel to the axes of the rod-shaped products in the 
hopper and is rotated with oscillatory motion, the rollers 
being disposed alternately offset to one another upwards and 
downwards, relatively to an horizontal plane and, the 
relative offsetting of the axes of the rollers corresponds 
substantially to approximately half the diameter of the 
rod-shaped products, or to an order of magnitude of that type, while 
the free transverse gap between two adjacent rollers and the 
width of the duct beneath, at least in the mouth area, are 
smaller than twice the diameter of a rod-shaped product and larger 
than the diameter of a rod-shaped product, and preferably 
approximately one and a half times the diameter of a 
rod-shaped product.  
 A hopper of this type is known from the document FR-A-2 
372085, in which the staggered rollers have a circular 
cross-section. From the document US-A-3 435940 a similar 
hopper is known, in which the rollers have a polygonal 
cross-section, but are aligned with their axes in the same 
horizontal plane. In these known hoppers, the rollers transmit their 
rotary motion to the cigarettes in such a degree, that the 
rotation of the cigarettes around their own axis can cause 
the tobacco to come out from the ends of the cigarettes, so 
to empty partially the cigarettes and to contribute to the 
formation of faulty products. The object of the invention is to provide a hopper of 
the type initially described and defined in the 
pre-characterizing part of claim 1, and in which , owing to 
relatively single and inexpensive means, the rod-shaped products are 
subjected to a considerably reduced rotation about their own 
axis. To this end the hopper according to the invention is 
characterized in that the rollers have a polygonal 
transverse cross-section and are oscillated in both 
directions around a predetermined median position, in which 
the upper surface of the roller is substantially horizontal 
and constitutes a support

Supply hopper for delicate, rod-shaped products, in 
particular in cigarette packaging machines, which hopper (1) 

is provided in its lower part with a plurality of separate 
discharge channels (2), each of which is divided by means of 

intermediate walls (4) into several ducts (3) which are 
vertical and parallel to one another, in each of which ducts 

(3) there is formed at least one substantially vertical row 
of rod-shaped products (S) which are superimposed on one another, 

whereas above the upper end (104) of each intermediate wall 
(4) there is provided a roller (6) which is horizontal and 

parallel to the axis of the rod-shaped products (S) in the hopper (1) 
and is rotated with oscillatory motion, the rollers (6) 

being disposed alternately offset to one another upwards and 
downwards, relatively to an horizontal plane and, in the 

relative offsetting of the axes of the rollers (6) 
corresponds substantially to approximately half the diameter 

of the rod-shaped products (S), or to an order of magnitude of that 
type, while the free transverse gap between two adjacent 

rollers (6) and the width of the duct (3) beneath, at least 
in the mouth area, are smaller than twice the diameter of 

a rod-shaped product and larger than the diameter of a 
rod-shaped product, and preferably approximately one and a half times 

the diameter of a rod-shaped product, 
characterized in that
 the  
 

rollers (6) have a polygonal transverse cross-section and 
are oscillated in both directions around a predetermined 

median position, in which the upper surface (306) of the 
roller (6) is substantially horizontal and constitutes a 

support surface for the rod-shaped product above, while, the 
amplitude of oscillation in both directions is such that in 

each extreme oscillation position, the said upper support 
surface (306) is in a substantially vertical position,

the rollers (6) have a square transverse cross-section. 
Hopper according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the oscillation performed by the rollers (6) is 90° 

clockwise and 90° anticlockwise, whereas the rollers are 
disposed such that in the median angular position between 

the two extreme oscillation positions, and in the said two 
extreme oscillation positions, the roller (6) has two 

vertical sides and two horizontal sides (306, 406).

rollers (6) is approximately that of the rod-shaped products.

characterized in that the rollers (6) have sides 6 mm long, 

a distance between rollers of 16.5 mm, and reciprocal 
offsetting of 3 to 4 mm.
