<ABSTRACT>
An embracing portion (7) is formed on a fusible body (2) of 
metal, and a chip (3) of low-melting metal is embraced by this 

embracing portion, and a constricted portion (4) of a small 
cross-sectional 

area is formed at the fusible body, and a radiating 
plate (5) is provided in the vicinity of the constricted portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuse used in an automobile
or the like for protecting a load circuit against an excess
current.Fuses made of a copper alloy or the like have
heretofore been used for protecting an excess current-flowing
circuit such as a motor load circuit in an automobile and also
for protecting a circuit when a large burst current due to a
rare short circuit is produced. Usually, such a fuse has been
provided in the form of a terminal with a fuse in which the
fuse is formed integrally with a terminal portion, or in the
form of a terminal with a fuse in which a fuse element is
bonded to a terminal portion.Fig. 6 is an exploded, perspective view of one example
of such a conventional terminal with a fuse, in which a fuse
element is bonded to a terminal portion.In this Figure, the terminal 100 with a fuse comprises
the fuse element 101, the terminal portion 102 comprising a
pair of wire fitting portions 102A each having a fuse element
connection portion 102B formed at an upper end thereof, and a
housing 103. Opposite ends of the fuse element 101 are bonded
respectively to the two fuse element connection portions 102B 
of the terminal portion 102, and the fuse element 101 and the
terminal portion 102 thus connected together are housed in the
housing 103 of a synthetic resin or the like.A cover 104 made of a transparent resin is removably
attached to an upper end of the housing 103 for preventing dust
and the like from intruding into the housing and for enabling
the fusion of the fuse to be viewed with the eyes from the
exterior.A pair of mating terminals (not shown) connected to a
load circuit are fitted in and connected to the pair of wire
fitting portions 102A, respectively, so that current flows into
one wire fitting portion 102A, flows through the fuse element
101, and then flows out of the other wire fitting portion 102A.
At this time, if an excess current larger than an operating
current flows as a result of the occurrence of some
abnormality, the temperature of the fuse element 101 is raised
by the generation of Joule heat proportional to the product of
the square of a current density and a resistance value, and
when this exceeds a predetermined temperature, the fuse element
101 is fused to break the circuit.Three kinds of fuse elements heretofore used will now
be described with reference to Figs. 7 to 9, respectively.Fig. 7(a) is a top plan view of a fuse element 51, and
the fuse element 51 comprises a fusible body 52 part of which
is a constricted portion 53, and connection ends 54

<CLAIMS>
A fuse element comprising:

a fusible body (2) including:

a constricted portion (4) with a cross-sectional area smaller than that of
the fusible body (2);
an embracing portion (7) for embracing a chip (3) of low-melting metal
therein, and
a radiating plate (5) for performing a radiating effect;
characterised in that

the constricted portion (4) is provided between the embracing portion (7)
and the radiating plate (5).
A fuse element as claimed in claim 1, wherein the constricted portion (4) is
fused at a first predetermined current.
A fuse element as claimed in claim 1, wherein the embracing portion (7) is
fused at a second predetermined current lower than the first

predetermined current with a predetermined time of a period. 
A fuse element as claimed in claim 1, wherein the radiating plate (5)
alleviates a temperature rise of the constricted portion (4) to prolong a

fusion time of the fuse element (1) at the second predetermined current.
A fuse element as claimed in claim 1, wherein said embracing portion (7),
said constricted portion (4) and said radiating plate (5) are integrally

formed.
A fuse element as claimed in claim 1, further comprising:

a terminal portion (8A,8B) including a pair of contact portions,
wherein said embracing portion (7), said constricted portion (4) and said
radiating plate (5) are integrally formed with the terminal portion (6).
A fuse element as claimed in claim 1, further comprising:

a terminal portion induding a pair of contact portions, each of wire fitting
portion having a fuse element connection portion at the upper end thereof.
