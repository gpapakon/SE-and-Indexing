<ABSTRACT>
In electrical protective circuit-breakers for rail mounting used for disconnecting high short-circuit currents, in order to avoid the risk of a flashover to adjacent devices as a result of arc gas residues emerging, a covering cap (1) is subsequently clipped elastically to the housing (3), over the gas outlet openings (4) (which are located at the bottom) and the terminal connection region (box terminal 5) on the apparatus narrow side, in order to form a further expansion space.
