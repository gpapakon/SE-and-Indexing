<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic flowmeter controller, comprising emitter sensor pairs 
coaxial to a rectilinear measurement tube which has a cross-section 

uniformly decreasing from its inlet, this latter being of 
annular radial extension symmetrical about the tube axis, and 

being provided with a grid of annular structure offering a 
resistance to passage of the fluid under examination which 

increases from the outer end to the inner end of the grid, and 
being connected to the tube by an annular inlet duct which is 

curved in the shape of a circular arc with a uniformly decreasing 
cross-section and comprises a deflection fairing of substantially 

conical extension in correspondence with the tube axis; an axial 
flow deflector is provided at the tube outlet to convey the fluid 

into an annular duct of decreasing cross-section, of which the 
radial exit port is closable by a valving member moved along the 

measurement tube axis by operating means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new type of meter which, by using
ultrasound and adopting suitable expedients associated with a
particular geometry of the measurement tube ensures under all
conditions a constantly laminar flow with a parabolic fluid
velocity distribution within said tube to hence enable the
emitter-sensor pairs for the ultrasonic beam to be positioned
aligned along the tube axis where the signals are least disturbed
and of greatest intensity, and in addition allows not only an
economical and highly precise measurement of the flow rate of any
fluid to be achieved but also allows said flow rate to be easily
and precisely controlled and the flow to be instantaneously shut
off, as will without doubt for safety reasons be required of a
later generation of gas meters for domestic and in particular
industrial use.In the present state of the art, for such gas meters mechanical
systems are used which operate by displacement of gas volumes
within one or more chambers of bellows type and hence of variable
geometry, by means of a rotary distributor or reciprocating slide
valves, the flow rate being proportional to the volumetric
displacement of said chambers. Such known meters have however the drawbacks of a mechanically
complex and hence costly structure, plus moving parts the
inevitable wear and soiling of which can prejudice measurement
correctness. Again, their exquisitely mechanical nature makes
them particularly unsuitable for development as an "intelligent"
meter without further costly constructional complications.
From the state of the art there are also known various types of
systems for measuring the flow of gas and fluids in general based
on the ultrasound principle, ie determining the variations in the
time taken by ultrasonic beams to pass from emitters to sensors or
receivers variously positioned relative to the axis of the
measurement tube.Although said ultrasound principle is intrinsically insensitive to
dirt and suitable for "intelligent" development of the relative
measurement system, it has however the serious drawback of being
strongly influenced by the type of motion of the fluid within the
tube, and this in particular along the tube axis, so that each
time there is discontinuity in the fluid motion in the sense of
passing from laminar to turbulent flow, the flow measurement is
affected by an error consequent on the change in the fluid
velocity distribution from a parabolic to a flat profile. Again,
the presence of a flow which can be randomly laminar or turbulent
always creates

A fluid flowmeter-controller, comprising a rectilinear
measurement tube (1) having an inlet and an outlet for the fluid under

examination and, in correspondence with these, at least one pair
of ultrasonic beam emitters (18) cooperating with at least one

corresponding pair of sensors (17) or receivers to determine the time
taken for said beam (16) to pass from the emitters (18) to the sensors (17) both

in the flow direction and in the opposite direction, characterised
in that said pairs of ultrasonic emitters-sensors (18, 17) are installed

coaxial to the rectilinear measurement tube (1), which has a cross-section
uniformly decreasing from said inlet, this latter being of

annular radial extension symmetrical about said measurement tube
axis (8), and being provided with a grid (9) of annular structure offering

a resistance to passage of the fluid under examination which
increases from the outer (11) end to the inner end (12) of the grid (9), and

being connected to the measurement tube (1) by an annular inlet duct (13)

decreasing cross-section and comprises, facing the inlet emitter-sensor
pair (18, 17), an inlet deflection fairing (15) of substantially conical

extension, an axial flow deflector (23) also being provided to the
front of and coaxial to the outlet emitter-sensor pair (18, 17) to convey

the fluid into an annular outlet duct (24) of decreasing cross-section,
of which the exit port, of annular radial extension (25), can be

constricted until total closure by a valving member movable along
the measurement tube axis (1) by operating means.
