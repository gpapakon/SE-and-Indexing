<ABSTRACT>
Injectable grout including a hydraulic binder in suspension in water, characterised in that it additionally includes, relative to the weight of the hydraulic binder, (A) from 2 to 50 % by weight of particles of at least one inorganic substance whose median diameter is smaller than half the median diameter of the particles of the hydraulic binder, and (B) from 0.05 to 5 % by weight of a hydroxyethyl cellulose. Use in civil engineering.

<CLAIMS>
An injectable grout including a hydraulic binder in suspension in
water, characterised in that it additionally includes, relative to the weight of

the hydraulic binder, (A) from 2 to 50% by weight of particles of at least one
mineral substance whose median diameter is smaller than half the median

diameter of the particles of the hydraulic binder, and (B) from 0.05 to 5% by
weight of hydroxyethyl cellulose.
The grout as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
proportion of the ingredient (A) represents 1 to 10% of the weight of the

hydraulic binder.
The grout as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the
proportion of the ingredient (A) represents 2 to 5% of the weight of the

hydraulic binder.
The grout as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the proportion of the ingredient (B) represents from 0.1 to 1% of the

weight of the hydraulic binder.
The grout as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the ingredient (A) is selected from silica, titanium dioxide and alumina.
A process for consolidation and/or sealing of granular media and/or
of fissured media by injection into such a medium of a curable grout based on

a hydraulic binder, characterised in that the said binder is as defined in any
one of claims 1 to 5.
