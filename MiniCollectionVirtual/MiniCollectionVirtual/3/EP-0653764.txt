A cable having a thixotropic filling compound therein, 
the filling compound being a gel composition including a 

water absorbent hydrocarbon polymer with pendent anionic 
groups. The composition eliminates shorts caused by 

moisture contact with such wires. The cable including the 
composition is stabilized against thermally induced 

capacitance changes and shows improved oxidation induction 
times.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a telecommunications cable, and
a method of making such a cable.Communications cables such as telephone lines are
typically copper wire, which are insulated from each other
with a thick layer of a thermoplastic resin and bundled by
an insulating material. Bundles of insulated pairs of
conducting wires are then wrapped with a sheath of plastic,
paper wrapping or other material, into a cable. A filler
such as a petroleum gel is added to many cables inside the
cable cover to fill the interstitial spaces and retard
water migration therein.In recognition of the essential nature of the
ability of telecommunications cable to be able to withstand
exposure to water, the industry has promulgated certain
performance standards which the cable must achieve. In
particular, one standard requires that a 91.5 cm (three
foot) long section of cable not pass water when maintained
under a column of water 91.5 cm (three feet) high (e.g. a
"three foot water head"). The industry is currently
considering a change in that standard to require that a
section of cable 2.44 metre (eight feet) long not pass
water when subjected to 3.66 metre (twelve feet) of water
head for twenty four hours. The prior art discloses protection of
telecommunications cable against water invasion by filling
the spaces between the wrapped bundles of conducting wires
inside the cable (referred to as the filling zone) with
compounds such as polyethylene-petroleum jelly (PEPJ) and
oil-extended thermoplastic rubbers (ETPR), the latter being
widely used by AT&T and the Bell regional operating
companies in the United States and sold under the trademark
FLEX-GEL. For example, US-A-4,259,540 discloses a suitable
oil-extended thermoplastic rubber for use in a cable.Certain Patents also describe telecommunications
cables including water swellable polymers such as polyvinyl
alcohol, polyacrylamides, or cellulose derivatives, which
are applied to bundle wrappings or contained in "moisture
barriers" which are spaced internally along the length of
the cable. For example, US-A-3,607,487 and US-A-3,717,716
discloses the use of materials comprising petroleum jelly
mixed with a polymer such as polypropylene as a filling
composition for a cable. Such cables are, however,
characterised by a number of limitations and disadvantages.It has been shown that the oils in PEPJs and ETPRs
that are used in prior art cables are absorbed into the
polyolefin insulation of the paired conductors in the
cable. This absorption causes the insulation to swell,
causing

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunications cable comprising a plurality
of paired conductors, insulation surrounding said paired

conductors, and a wrapping round the insulated, paired
conductors, the space therebetween being filled with a

composition characterised in that the cable has a
substantially stable mutual capacitance between said paired

conductors as the cable undergoes thermal expansion, said
composition being comprised of a dielectric base oil, a

water absorbing polymer, and a thixotrope, wherein the said
components are selected such that the composition has a

dielectric constant which increases as the temperature to
which the cable is exposed increases, thereby mitigating

the decrease in the mutual capacitance of the cable
resulting from the expansion effect of increased

temperature on the paired conductors, insulation and
wrapping.
The cable of Claim 1, wherein the water absorbing
polymer is in the range of about 5 to about 33 weight

percent of the composition.
The cable of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the dielectric
oil is in the range of about 65 to about 82 weight percent

of the composition.
The cable of Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
thixotrope is in the range of about 1 to about 15 percent

of the composition. 
The cable of Claim 4, wherein the thixotrope is
silica and is in the range of about 4 to about 8 percent of

the composition.
The telecommunications cable of Claim 1, wherein
the composition is formed by mixing about 70 to 85 weight

percent dielectric base oil, about 1 to 15 weight percent
thixotrope, and about 6 to 20 weight percent water

absorbing polymer.
The cable of any one of the preceding Claims,
wherein the dielectric oil is an oil having a molecular

weight in the range of 400 to about 1000.
The telecommunications cable of any one of Claims
1 to 6 wherein the dielectric base oil is comprised of a

hydrocarbon oil having a molecular weight of about 200 or
higher and an extender.
The telecommunications cable of Claim 8 wherein the
extender is a block co-polymer, thermoplastic rubber,

polyethylene powder, microcrystalline wax, or polyethylene
or thylene microspheres, or mixtures of same.
A method of making a telecommunications cable
comprising the steps of wrapping a plurality of paired,

insulated conductors into a bundle, and filling the spaces
between the paired, insulated conductors in the bundle with

a composition characterised in that the composition is
comprised of a dielectric base oil, a water absorbing

polymer, and a thixotrope, wherein the said components are
selected such that the composition has a dielectric

constant which increases as the temperature to which the
cable is exposed increases, thereby mitigating the decrease

in the mutual capacitance of the cable resulting from the 
expansion effect of increased temperature on the paired

conductors, insulation and wrapping.
The method of Claim 10 wherein a plurality of
bundles of paired, insulated conductors are bound together

with a sheath, and wherein the spaces inside the sheath and
between the bundles are also filled with the composition.
