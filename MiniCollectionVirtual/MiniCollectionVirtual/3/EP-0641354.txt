<DESCRIPTION>
 OLIGONUCLEOTIDES HAVING ANINOHYDROCARBON PHOSPHONATE MOIETIESThis application is a continuation-in-part of Application Serial No. 796,804, filed November 25, 1991.This invention relates to oligonucleotides which bind to RNA (such as mRNA), DNA, proteins, or peptides, including, for example, oligonucleotides which inhibit mRNA function. More particularly, this invention relates to oligonucleotides in which one or more of the nucleotides include an aminohydrocarbon phosphonate moiety.Watson-Crick base pairing enables an oligonucleotide to act as an antisense complement to a target sequence of an mRNA in order to block processing or effect translation arrest and regulate selectively gene expression. (Cohen, Oligodeoxynucleotides, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida (1989)); Uhlmann, et al., Chem. Rev. , Vol. 90, pgε. 543-584 (1990)). Oligonucleotides have also been utilized to interfere with gene expression directly at the DNA level by formation of triple-helical (triplex) structures in part through Hoogsteen bonding interactions (Moffat, Science, Vol. 252, pgε 1374-1375 (1991)). Furthermore, oligonucleotides have been shown to bind specifically to proteins (Oliphant, et al., Molec. Cell. Biol. Vol 9, pgs. 2944-2949 (1989)) and could thus be used to block undesirable protein function. 

 Natural oligonucleotides, which are negatively charged, however, are poor candidates for therapeutic agents due to their poor penetrability into the cell and their susceptibility to degradation by nucleases. Therefore, it is expected that relatively high concentrations of natural oligonucleotides would be required in order to achieve a therapeutic effect.To overcome the above shortcomings, various strategies have been devised. U.S. Patent No. 4,469,863, issued to Miller, et al., discloses the manufacture of nonionic nucleic acid alkyl and aryl phosphonates, and in particular nonionic nucleic acid methyl phosphonates. U.S. Patent No. 4,757,055, also issued to Miller, et al., discloses a method for selectively controlling unwanted expression of foreign nucleic acid in an animal or in mammalian cells by binding the nucleic acid with a nonionic oligonucleotide alkyl or aryl phosphonate analogue.Oligonucleotides have also been synthesized in which one non-bridging oxygen in each phosphodiester moiety is replaced by sulfur. Such analogues sometimes are referred to as phosphorothioate (PS) analogues, or "all PS" analogues, (Stein, et al., Nucl. Acids Res., Vol. 16, pgs. 3209-3221 (1988)). Another approach has been to attach a
