<ABSTRACT>
A bending and straightening machine (100) for elongated workpieces (20) such as camshafts, pinion shafts and the like has one or several straightening dies (14) which subject the workpiece (20) to a bending strain between straightening supports arranged on the machine bed (10). The straightening die (14) is arranged on a swivelling device (30) having a two-armed lever (36) which can swivel around an axis (32') and which projects on both sides of the axis (32'). The straightening die (14) is linked to one arm (36'), whereas a drive (31) which causes the two-armed lever (36) to swivel engages the free end of the other arm (36'').

40°. 
Straightening machine according to claim 3' characterised in 
that other arm (236'', 336'') of the two-armed lever (236, 336) is bent 

away from the workpiece (20) away from the one arm (236', 336') 
substantially at right angles. 
Straightening machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that two-armed levers (36, 236, 336) provided at the two 

opposite ends of the machine table (10) in the direction of the length of 
the workpiece (20), of which the drives are synchronised, are connected 

together to form a pivoting structural unit (30, 230, 330) by a connecting 
member (33, 233, 333) extending parallel to the direction of the length of 

the workpiece (20). 
Straightening machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a two-armed lever (36) is arranged at one end of the 

machine table (10), that at the opposite end of the machine table (10) in 
the direction of the length of the workpiece (20) a one-armed lever (56) is 

mounted in a further pivoting bearing (52) aligned with the bearing (32) 
of the two-armed lever (36), the one-armed lever extending parallel to the 

one arm (36') and being of the same length, and that the lever (56) and 
the one arm (36') are connected together by a connecting member (33) 

extending parallel to the direction of the length of the workpiece (20).  
 
Straightening machine according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the straightening stamp (14) is arranged on the
