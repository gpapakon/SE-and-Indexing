<DESCRIPTION>
 T I T L E PROCESS FOR MAKING POLYA-VODE/POLYOLEFIN BLENDSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for preparing polyamide/polyolefin blends having superior toughness and stiffness compared with currently available blends of such polymers.Polyamide resins (or polyamides) are well known in the art and have been used for many years, La., as engineering or molding resins, fiber-forming resins, and barrier resins in packaging materials. Crystalline polyamides, especially those made from short chain monomers, e.g., nylon 6 and nylon 66, are very stiff, which is desirable for molding resins, but they are sensitive to moisture. Addition of crystalline polyolefins, such as polyethylene or polypropylene reduces moisture sensitivity but suffers from incompatibility between these two polymers, so that acceptable end-use blends are not made. Further, although polyamides have good physical properties, such as tensile strength and flexural (or flex) modulus, that make these resins suitable for fabricating a variety of articles, they are not considered tough. Their notched Izod impact strength either is too low under ordinary test conditions or decreases significantly with a modest change of temperature, thickness, orientation, or notch radius. It, therefore, is conventional in the industry to toughen polyamide resins by blending them with soft, rubbery polymers which can absorb mechanical shocks without significantly impairing the tensile properties of the polyamides with which they are blended. However, because those soft polymers normally have very low stiffness (or flex moduli), addition of such polymers to thermoplastic resins normally results in blends that have lower flex moduli than the matrix resins alone, so that improvement of one property is accomplished at the sacrifice of the other. While there is abundant art describing such blends, the most pertinent patent in this area is U.S. 4,174,358, to Epstein, describing blends of polyamides with various types of toughening polymers. The Epstein invention involves a process for the preparation of multiphase thermoplastic compositions comprising admixing a defined polyamide matrix resin with at least one of a number of possible polymers having a much lower tensileSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 modulus and containing sites which are adherent to the matrix resin, and then shearing to disperse the polymer in the matrix resin to a particle size of 0.01 to 3 microns, so that the polymer adheres to the matrix resin. According to the patent specification and
