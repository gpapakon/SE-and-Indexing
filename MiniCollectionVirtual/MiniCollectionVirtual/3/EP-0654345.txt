<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminated carrier film for use in a ceramic green sheet and
to a ceramic green sheet producing method. 
More
specifically, this invention relates to a laminated
carrier film which is useful for simultaneously
producing two thin ceramic green sheets.A ceramic green sheet which is used for the
production of a multilayered ceramic substrate, a
laminated ceramic capacitor, etc. is generally produced
as follows. That is, a container with a doctor blade
is mounted on a carrier film formed of a plastic film
(e.g., a polyester film, a polypropylene film and a
polymethylpentene film) alone or a carrier film in
which a silicone coating is formed on one surface of
said film, A predetermined amount of a slurry (slip)
containing a ceramic powder, a plasticizer, a binder
and the like is then injected into the container. When
the carrier film is moved in a fixed direction, a green
sheet (undried) having a thickness corresponding to a
clearance between the doctor blade and the film is
continuously formed on the carrier film. When the
green sheet is dried with hot air or through an
infrared heater, a complete green sheet is formed. In
this method, since mechanical characteristics, flatness
and the like of the carrier film can be utilized in the
taking up of the green sheet and in the post treatments
such as electrode printing and cutting, there is an
advantage that the green sheet can be thinned.
However, said method involves problems such as a low
productivity and a high cost.On the other hand, in order to improve the
productivity of the ceramic green sheet, a dipping
method is also used which comprises dipping a carrier 
film in a container containing a slurry composed of a
ceramic powder, a plasticizer, a binder and the like,
levelling the slurry coated on both surfaces of the
carrier film in drawing it up to have a fixed
thickness, using a quantitative comma roll or the like,
and then drying the resulting coated film with hot air
or through an infrared heater to form a green sheet.
However, in this method it is required to peel off the
green sheet from the carrier film at an outlet of a
drier and to take up only the green sheet, and a
strength or a flatness of the green sheet per se is
utilized in the subsequent treatments such as electrode
printing and cutting. Accordingly, there are problems
that it is difficult to thin the green sheet which can
scarcely respond to the recent requirement of thinning
the green sheet. EP-A-0 348 310 discloses a laminated film comprising a release sheet,
