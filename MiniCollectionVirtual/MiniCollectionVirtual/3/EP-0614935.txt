<ABSTRACT>
A thermoformable, fibre-reinforced composite material contains from 5 to 70% by volume of unidirectionally aligned reinforcing fibres which have individual filament diameters of from 7 to 30  mu m and are connected by a matrix of a thermoplastic, elastomer-modified polypropylene which essentially wets the entire surface of the individual filaments. The elastomer-modified polypropylene preferably comprises a mixture of polypropylene and thermoplastic ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) and/or ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM). The reinforcing fibres preferably comprise glass.

<CLAIMS>
A thermoformable, fiber-reinforced composite
material having a content of 5 to 70% by volume

of unidirectionally aligned reinforcing fibers
having a length of at least 3 mm and individual

filament diameters of 7 to 30 µm, which are
bonded by a matrix of a thermoplastic polymer

which essentially wets the entire surface of the
individual filaments, wherein the thermoplastic

polymer is an elastomer-modified polypropylene.
A composite material as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the elastomer-modified polypropylene

consists of a blend of polypropylene with
thermoplastic ethylene-propylene-diene rubber

(EPDM) and/or ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM).
A composite material as claimed in claim 2,
wherein the proportion of EPDM and/or EPM in the

elastomer-modified polypropylene is 2 to 40% by
weight, preferably 5 to 30% by weight.
A pellet consisting of a composite material as
claimed in claim 1 having a length of at least 3

mm, the length of the reinforcing fibers being
equal to the length of the pellet.
A continuous strand consisting of a composite
material as claimed in claim 1. 
A process for the production of a thermoformable,
fiber-reinforced composite material, in which a

multiplicity of continuous filaments having individual
filament diameters of 7 to 30 µm are

arranged in parallel to form a ribbon and tensioned,
the filament ribbon is impregnated with

molten thermoplastic polymer in a melt pultrusion
process, the filament ribbon being drawn over at

least 2 heated spreader surfaces and a proportion
by volume of 5 to 70% by volume of continuous

filaments being established in the solidifying
filament ribbon, which comprises using an

elastomer-modified polypropylene as the
thermoplastic polymer.
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein
impregnation is carried out with a melt of

elastomer-modified polypropylene which, measured
at low shear rates, has a viscosity of 105 to

2500 Pa·s and the drawing tension is set to 5 to
50 N per 4000 individual filaments on entry into

the first spreader surface.
The process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
speed of the filament ribbon is at least 3 m/min.
The process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
drawing tension during the drawing off of the

impregnated filament ribbon from the last
spreader surface is at least 50 N per 4000

individual filaments.
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
geometry of the spreader surfaces is adjusted

such that the nips defined by spreader surfaces
and entering ribbon are filled with melt.
The use of the composite material as claimed in
claim 1 for the production of paintable molded 

parts, in particular for automobile construction.
The use of the pellets as claimed in claim 4 for
the production of molded parts by injection

molding, blow molding, extrusion or hot-pressing
or mixtures of these processes.
The use of the continuous strands as claimed in
claim 5 for the production of wound molded parts.
The use of the pellets as claimed in claim 4
mixed with granules of a fiber-free polymer

and/or granules of polymer having a content of
reinforcing fibers of a length of at most 0.5 mm,

the polymer being selected from the group comprising
polypropylene and elastomer-modified

polypropylene.
