<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus and a method
for measuring the average aspect ratio of non-spherical,
e.g. laminar or ellipsoidal, particles in a
suspension. In particular, although not exclusively,
the invention relates to the measurement of the average
aspect ratio of kaolin particles in suspension in a
fluid.In many applications of particulate solid
materials the aspect ratio of the particles of the
material is a parameter which profoundly affects the
performance of the material. For example, if the
particulate material is used in a composition for
coating paper, the surface finish of the paper is
determined to a large degree by the average aspect
ratio of the particles. If it is required to produce a
coated paper which has a smooth, glossy finish the particulate
material will need to have a different average
aspect ratio from that required if the coated paper is
to have a matt surface with greater ink absorbency.Figure 1 illustrates the meaning of the expression
"aspect ratio" used in this application. The
expression "aspect ratio" means "the diameter of the
circle of area equivalent to that of a face of the
particle divided by the mean thickness of that
particle". In Figure 1 a kaolin particle P is shown
with a superimposed circle having an area equivalent to
that of the face of the particle. The diameter of that
circle is d, the thickness of the particle is t and the
aspect ratio of the particle is d/t.It has previously been found that the average
aspect ratio of particles in a suspension may be
calculated from the measurement of the conductivity of
the suspension. In the present applicant's previous
British Patent Application No. 9101291.4 (Publication
No. 2240398) a method and an apparatus are described 
for obtaining a measurement indicative of the aspect
ratio of non-spherical particles in suspension. The
conductivity of the suspension is measured between
points for two different orientations of the particles
in suspension and the difference between the two
measured conductivities is used as an indication of the
particle aspect ratio. The particle orientation may be
aligned for the first conductivity measurement and may
be aligned transverse to the first orientation
direction, or have random alignment, for the second
conductivity measurement. The specification also
discloses a further alternative in which there is a
single aligned orientation but transversely directed
conductivity measurements .However, problems have been discovered with this
prior art apparatus and method, in particular

A method of obtaining a measure of the
average aspect ratio of non-spherical particles

comprising the steps of:

obtaining a fully-deflocculated suspension of the
particles;
causing the particles in the suspension to
orientate generally in one direction;
measuring the conductivity of the particles
