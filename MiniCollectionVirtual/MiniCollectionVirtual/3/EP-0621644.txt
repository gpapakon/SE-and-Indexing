<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor 
devices and more particularly to a field-effect transistor 
formed in a semiconductor-over-insulator structure. In order to increase isolation and improve operating 
characteristics, it is known in the art to fabricate 
semiconductor devices in what is commonly termed a 
"semiconductor-over-insulator" (SOI) structure. In conventional, bulk-silicon semiconductor device structures, 
devices such as bipolar and field-effect transistors (FET) are 
fabricated directly in the silicon (or other semiconductor) 
substrate/wafer. Device isolation is accomplished using a 
variety of techniques, such as doped regions, buried layers, 
insulator-filled trenches, and combinations of these 
structures. These isolation structures are often complex to 
form, space-consuming, and provide less than desirable 
isolation characteristics. In an SOI structure, semiconductor devices are formed in a 
typically thin, active layer of semiconductor material, the 
semiconductor material being formed directly on a layer of 
insulating material. The insulating material may in turn be 
formed over a bulk, base substrate of semiconductor material. 
This SOI structure, with the integral layer of insulating 
material, yields a final device structure having a desirably 
high level of device isolation. This isolation is typically 
achieved in a less complex and more compact manner than the 
previously described bulk-silicon isolation techniques.  The present inventors have determined that, for FETs 
fabricated in a conventional SOI structure, the short-channel, 
threshold voltage roll-off of a fully-depleted, thin-film 
device is worse than that of similar devices formed in 
conventional, bulk-semiconductor material. Thus, FET devices 
formed in a conventional SOI environment cannot take full 
advantage of the benefits typically afforded by the SOI 
structure. One object of the present invention is to provide a new and 
improved FET structure. A more particular object of the present invention is to 
provide such an FET structure implemented in an SOI 
environment. Another object of the present invention is to provide such an 
FET structure having an improved short-channel, threshold 
voltage roll-off, and decreased source-channel and drain-channel 
leakage currents. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided a semiconductor device, comprising: a base 
substrate of semiconductor material; a layer of insulating 
material over the substrate; an active
