<ABSTRACT>
A measuring nozzle (10) and two optical measuring probes (11, 12) are built into the combustion chamber (4). The measuring nozzle is constructed as a fuel injection nozzle. The construction of this nozzle (10) is such that at least a portion of the quantity of fuel it injects into the combustion chamber is directed transverse to the swirling flow of the air. The two optical measuring probes (11, 12) are arranged downstream of the measuring nozzle (10) in the direction of the swirling movement of the air. Relative to one another, the two measuring probes (11, 12) are located one behind another in the direction of the swirling movement, with the result that the flame generated by the injection by the measuring nozzle passes the two probes sequentially in time.

A method for determining the swirl speed of the air flow
in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating internal

combustion engine comprising at least one cylinder,
characterised in that
 one measuring nozzle (10)
constructed as a fuel injection nozzle and two optical

measuring heads (11, 12) are installed in the combustion
chamber (4),


in that
 at least a part of the quantity of fuel injected
from the measuring nozzle (10) into the combustion

chamber (4) is injected directed at right angles to the
swirling flow of the air,
and in that
 the two optical measuring heads (11, 12) are
also disposed in the direction of the swirling motion of

the air downstream from the measuring nozzle (10) and the
two measuring heads (11, 12) are disposed one behind the

another in the direction of the swirling motion.
A method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the measuring nozzle (10) is fitted
at a place in the combustion chamber (4) at which a fuel

injection nozzle is normally disposed,
and in that
 the measuring heads (11, 12) - contained in
a measuring head retaining device (9) - are fitted at a

place in the combustion chamber at which a start valve
for the reciprocating internal combustion engine is

normally disposed.
A cylinder of a reciprocating internal combustion engine
with fitted unit for determining the swirl speed of the

air stream in the combustion chamber of the cylinder,

characterised in that
 the fitted unit includes a
measuring nozzle (10) constructed as a fuel injection

nozzle and two optical measuring heads (11, 12) for
fitting into the combustion chamber (40), wherein the 

measuring nozzle (10) is constructed and disposed in such
a manner that at least one part of the quantity of fuel

injected therefrom (10) into the combustion chamber (4)
is directed at right angles to the swirling flow of the

air,
and in that
 furthermore the optical measuring heads (11,
12) are disposed in the direction of the swirling motion

of the air downstream from the measuring nozzle (10) and
the two measuring heads (11, 12) are disposed one behind

the other in the direction of the swirling motion.
A cylinder according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the measuring nozzle (10) comprises
at least one injection hole directed in the same

direction as the measurement regions of the two measuring
heads (11, 12).
A cylinder according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the measuring nozzle (10) comprises
more than three injection holders (20a, 20b, 20c, 20d,

20e), which all lie in a common plane extending at right
angles to the swirling flow of the air and three (20a,

20b, 20c) of which are directed in the same direction as
the measurement regions of the two measuring heads (10,

11).
