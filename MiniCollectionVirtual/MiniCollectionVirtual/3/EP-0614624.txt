<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shoe, in particular sports shoe, which contains a flexible shaft (2) with two shaft parts (2a, 2b) which can be braced in relation to one another and, supported by the shaft (2), a rotary clamping closure (3) with a closure housing (5) and a clamping cable (7) which is guided through two cable passage openings (8, 9) in the closure housing (5), forms an outer pull loop engaging on cable deflection guides (10) of the shaft parts (2a, 2b) and, for the purpose of drawing together and loosening the shaft parts (2a, 2b), can be wound up and unwound with the aid of a rotary actuating grip (6) in the closure housing (5). To achieve a simple and economical structure, the housing (5) is, on both cable passage openings (8, 9), provided with flexible guide tabs (13, 14) for the clamping cable (7) and fastened on the shaft (2) by means of these two guide tabs (13, 14).
