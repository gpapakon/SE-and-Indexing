<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a transponder system for the 
wireless transmission of data logged in a vehicle to an 

interrogating station. A battery powered transponder (10) is 
installed in the vehicle, which possesses a memory (50) for the 

logged data and for the identifying code (ID) assigned to the 
vehicle. In response to an interrogating pulse from the 

interrogating device (18) at the base station the battery 
powered transponder (10) transmits the identifying code (ID) 

and the data to the interrogating device (18) for the reception 
and processing thereof. Furthermore at a position in vicinity 

of the battery powered transponder (10) a battery-less transponder 
(24) is accommodated in the vehicle, in which at least 

one identifying code (ID) assigned to the vehicle is stored, 
and which in response to the reception of the interrogating 

pulse transmits at least this identifying code (ID) to the 
interrogating device (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transponder system for the
wireless transmission of data logged in a vehicle to an
interrogation station, comprising a battery powered transponder
installed in the vehicle and having a memory for the logged
data and an identifying code allotted to the vehicle, the
battery powered transponder being adapted, in response to an
interrogating pulse transmitted by an interrogating device at
the base station, to transmit, to the interrogating device, the
identifying code and the data for the reception and processing
thereof.Such a system is known from GB-A- 2 169 173.In vehicles, such as for instance trucks, transponder
systems are employed which are able to store vehicle-relevant
data and when required transmit the same wirelessly to a base
station. Such stored data may for example relate to the
respective route used and the idle times of the vehicle or it
may be a question of data entered by the driver using a
keyboard and consisting, for example, of details relating to
the quantity of fuel supplied, details concerning the
destination and the load on the truck. At the home depot the
data stored in the transponder can be recalled wirelessly with
the aid of an interrogating device, the latter transmitting an
interrogation pulse, which causes the return transmission of
the stored data. In order to render possible allocation of the
data to the vehicle, the transponder also contains a stored
identifying code, which is unequivocally associated with the
vehicle. The fact that the identifying code of the respective
vehicle is stored in the transponder may be employed for other
purposes than the association of the transmitted data with the
respective vehicle. The identifying code transmitted with the
data might for example be employed for checking the access
right so that for instance it would be possible to ensure that
only authorized vehicles would be allowed to enter a company
area. Furthermore it would be possible to ensure that only
authorized vehicles could receive fuel at a company fuel
station. In this case the interrogation device would, after
receiving and checking the identifying code, transfer an access
authorization to a control unit, which would then be able to
perform the required function (for example, opening of a gate
or enablement of a fuel pump).The transponder installed in the vehicle is normally
supplied with power from the vehicle's battery. This means
that its identifying code and the data stored in the
transponder is not able to be recalled if the vehicle's battery

<CLAIMS>
A transponder system for the wireless transmission of
data logged in a vehicle to an interrogation station,

comprising a battery powered transponder (10) installed in the
vehicle and having a memory (50) for the logged data and an

identifying code (ID) allotted to the vehicle, the battery
powered transponder (10) being adapted, in response to an

interrogating pulse transmitted by an interrogating device (18)
at the base station, to transmit, to the interrogating device

(18), the identifying code and the data for the reception and
processing thereof, characterized in that a battery-less

transponder (24) is installed in the vicinity of the battery
powered transponder (10), in which battery-less transponder at

least an identifying code (ID) also specific to the vehicle is
stored, said battery-less transponder being adapted to transmit

to the interrogating device (18) at least this identifying code
(ID) in response to receiving the interrogating pulse.
The transponder system as defined in claim 1,
characterized in that the identifying code (ID) stored in the

battery-less transponder (24) is the same as the identifying
code (ID) stored in the battery powered transponder (10).
The transponder system as defined in claim 1 or in
claim 2, characterized in the battery powered transponder (10)

is so driven that it transmits the data comprised in its memory
(50) completely or in part at regular intervals of time, that

the battery-less transponder (24) contains a data memory (27),
in which it accepts the data transmitted by the battery powered

transponder (10) and that the battery-less transponder (24),
together with the identifying code (ID) also transmits the data

stored in it. 
The transponder system as defined in claim 1, claim 2
or claim 3, characterized in that a control unit (22) is

provided at the base station, such control unit only enabling
the control functions when the interrogating device (18) has,

in response to the transmission of the interrogating pulse,
received the identifying code (ID) and has determined same to

be valid.
