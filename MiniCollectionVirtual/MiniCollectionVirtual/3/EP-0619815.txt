<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel process for the preparation 
of 4-methyl-5-(2-chloroalkyl)-thiazoles of the general 
formula 
 
wherein 
R stands for 2-chloroethyl, 2-chloropropyl or 2-chlorobutyl, 
by the aid of partially known intermediates. The compound of 
the formula 
 
and acid addition salts thereof (Clomethiazole) is the 
therapeutically widely applied active ingredient of anticonvulsives 
and sedatives. The compound of the formula (Ia) was 
first described in 1935 [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 57, 1876 (1935)). 
Its hydrochloride and ethane disulphonate salt are disclosed 
in GB-PS 792,158. Its phosphate salt is known from US-PS 
3,639,415. The known methods for the preparation of the thiazole 
derivatives unsubstituted in position 2 can be divided into 
two main types. When proceeding according to methods of the 
first type the 2-unsubstituted thiazole is obtained in one  
 
step. According to methods of the second type thiazole 
derivatives containing an easily removable substituent in 
position 2 are prepared and this substituent is removed in a 
second step. According to methods of the first type the thiazole 
ring is formed by reacting a halogenated ketone or aldehyde, 
which are halogenated in the α-position or aldehyde with 
thioformamide [Elderfield, R.C.: Heterocyclic Compounds, 
Vol. 5, page 516 (1957)] (Reaction scheme A). 
R1 and R2 = alkyl, aryl or nydrogen X = halogen This type of methods gives a good yield only in some 
cases [Buchman and Richardson: J. Am. Chem. Soc. 67, 395 
(1945); Erne, Ramirez and Burger: Helv. Chim. Acta 34, 143 
(1951)]. A further disadvantage of this method is the difficulty 
of preparing pure thioformamide and the instable character 
of thioformamide. To eliminate this difficulty the 
preparation of thioformamide was carried out in the reaction 
mixture itself from formamide and phosphorous pentasulphide, 
but this method succeeded only in some cases [Ganapathi and 
Venkataraman: Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. 22, 362 (1945)]. This 
method is strongly contaminating the environment because of 
the use of phosphorous pentasulphide. As the direct synthesis described above can hardly be 
realized on industrial scale, attention was paid to the 
indirect synthesis variants. One of these variants eliminates 
the amino group in position 2 via diazotization and the 
subsequent reduction of the diazonium group [Ganapathi and 
Venkataraman: Proc. Indian Acad. Sci 22, 366 (1945)]. The 2-amino-thiazole 
derivative necessary for this method is to be  
 
prepared in a separate step
