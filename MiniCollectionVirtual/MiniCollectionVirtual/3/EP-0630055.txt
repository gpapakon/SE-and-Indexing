<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating a polycrystalline silicon 
having a roughed surface, which is useful for a capacitor 

electrode is disclosed. The method is featured by 
depositing a polycrystalline silicon layer in such a 

manner that grains of silicon are caused at the surface 
of the polycrystalline silicon layer. The polycrystalline 

silicon layer thus obtained has a large effective surface 
area and is suitable for a capacitor electrode because of 

its increased effective surface area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of fabricating
semiconductor devices, and more particularly to fabrication
methods of forming polycrystalline silicon layers suitable
for use as electrodes for capacitors.In recent years, the memory cell size has been reduced
accompanying the increase in the degree of integration of
DRAMs, and along with it the area of storage capacitors
used for the cells tends to be decreased. For this reason,
stacked capacitors or trench stacked capacitors that have
a large effective area for the capacitor part, an excellent
α-ray resistance characteristic and a small interference
between the capacitor parts have been employed in order
to secure sufficiently high capacitances. However, for
64 Mbit DRAMs now under development each cell area is
anticipated to become smaller than 1.5 µm2, so that there
is required a capacitor insulating film with a thickness
of less than 50 Å (10 Å = 1 nm) when converted to equivalent thickness
of silicon dioxide (SiO2) film, even with the use of the
aforementioned structures. It is extremely difficult to
form such a thin capacitor insulating film uniformly and
without defect all over the chip. In order to resolve the above-mentioned problem, there
is conceived an idea of increasing the effective areas
of the opposing electrodes of a capacitor by providing a
micro roughness on the surface thereof to obtain a larger
electrostatic capacity for a capacitor of the same size.
A method for increasing the opposed electrode areas,
that is, for enlarging the effective surface areas,
of polycrystalline silicon electrodes is disclosed in
"Capacitance-Enhanced Stacked-Capacitor with Engraved
Storage Electrode for Deep Submicron DRAMs, Solid State
Devices and Materials, 1989, pp. 137-140. According to
this method, the surface of a polycrystalline silicon is
coated with spin-on-glass (SOG) containing photoresist
particles. Then the effective surface area of the
polycrystalline silicon film is increased by providing
a micro roughness the surface thereof by etching the SOG
film, whereby etching the polycrystalline silicon surface
using the resist particles as the mask.However, this method has the following problems.
Namely, there are required strict control of the size
of the resist particles and distribution of the resist
particles on the wafer with uniform density at the time
of coating, in addition to the complexity of the process
involved. Further relevant prior art is as follows.From US-A-4905072 is known a semiconductor device which
