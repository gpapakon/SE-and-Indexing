<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus for exposing a sample to 
ultraviolet radiation are disclosed. The present invention 

permits a sample contained within a shielded housing to be 
exposed to a source of ultraviolet radiation and 

simultaneously observed. The sample rests on a stage that 
can be moved relative to the source of the ultraviolet 

radiation while the irradiation is taking place, thus the 
effects of ultraviolet radiation upon biological materials 

such as blood can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, 
upper and lower banks of ultraviolet bulbs are disposed on 

either side of the stage. The movement of the banks of bulbs 
and the stage relative to one another is preferably 

controlled by a set of lead screws. In certain embodiments, 
the intensity of the emissions of the bulbs themselves can 

also be altered while continuously observing and irradiating 
the sample. The invention preferably uses radiation at a 

wavelength in the UV-B band, between about 280-320 nm or, 
more preferably, in the UV-A band, between about 320-400 nm.2

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and
apparatus for exposing materials to a source of
electromagnetic radiation. More particularly, the present
invention relates to the controlled exposure of samples of
biological materials such as blood to ultraviolet light.Certain effects caused by irradiating blood
products with ultraviolet light are known. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 4,726,949 -- Miripol, et al. discloses methods
whereby a thin film of white blood cells are irradiated with
ultraviolet radiation within the UV-B band at a wavelength of
280-320 nanometers (nm). Such irradiation causes the white
blood cells to lose their capability to set off an immune
reaction in an alloimmunized patient. As disclosed in the
above-mentioned patent, and in related U.S. Patent No.
4,726,949 also to Miripol, et al., the blood cells should be
in a thin film that is inserted between two banks of UV-B
bulbs mounted a fixed distance apart within a cabinet.
Because the intensity of the UV-B radiation and the geometry
of the emitters are fixed, the effect of the ultraviolet
radiation is described as a function of total energy exposure
per unit area. U.S. Patent No. 3,864,081 discloses an apparatus for sterilising biological materials by irradiation with ultraviolet radiation. Means are provided for varying the distance of the ultraviolet lamp from the biological materials.U.S. Patent No. 4,727,027--Wieshahn et al.
discloses decontaminating blood and blood components by
treating the blood with furocoumarin derivatives followed by 
irradiation with UV-A radiation having a wavelength between
about 300-400 nm at an intensity between 0.1 mW/cm and 5.0
W/cm. No apparatus is disclosed for carrying out this
technique.In general, the qualitative and quantitative
effects of ultraviolet radiation upon many biological
materials remains largely undetermined. In particular, the
effects of ultraviolet radiation in the UV-A band (320-400
nm) upon biological materials is being actively investigated.
As used herein, the term "biological materials" is meant to
encompass blood and components of blood, as well as any other
fluid produced by or present within a living organism, alone
or mixed with another substance, such as a photodynamic
reagent. Presently, it would be desirable for researchers to
be able to vary degree of exposure to which a particular
sample of biological material is subjected. As used herein,
the term "degree of exposure" includes a both the intensity
of the emission, e.g., the power level and the distance
between the
