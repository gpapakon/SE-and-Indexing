<ABSTRACT>
A residual gas is processed by hydrogenation and hydrolysis (1) to combine the sulphur compounds into a single compound H2S, cooling (4, 10) to a temperature within a range  THETA -180  DEG C, where  THETA  is the dew point of the water in the gaseous effluent from the hydrogenation and hydrolysis step, and selective catalytic oxidation (2a) of the H2S into sulphur at a temperature within the range  THETA -180  DEG C, wherein a sulphur deposit is formed on the catalyst and the sulphur-loaded catalyst is periodically regenerated (2b), followed by cooling of the regenerated catalyst within the range  THETA -180  DEG C to enable reuse in the catalytic oxidation step.

<CLAIMS>
Process for eliminating sulphur-containing 
compounds contained in a residual gas 

emanating directly from a CLAUS sulphur plant or 
emanating from a purification unit treating a 

residual gas from a sulphur plant using a process 
employing the CLAUS rea
ction, with recovery of the 
compounds in the form of sulphur, the process 

consisting in subjecting the residual gas to a 
combined hydrogenation and hydrolysis treatment in 

order to bring the sulphur-containing compounds it 
contains into the single form of H
2
S, in cooling 
said effluent and bringing the cooled resultant 

gaseous effluent, containing H
2
S, together with a 
gas containing free oxygen, in a molar ratio O
2
:H
2
S 
of from 0.5 to 3, into contact with a catalyst for 

the oxidation of the H
2
S to sulphur, which catalyst 
comprises an active phase based on one or more 

oxides and/or salts of one or more transition 
metals which is deposited on a support and being 

characterised in that the gaseous effluent 
resulting from the combined hydrogenation and 

hydrolysis treatment is cooled to a temperature of 
between 80°C and 100°C and the bringing into 

contact of the cooled gaseous effluent and the gas 
containing free oxygen with the catalyst for the 

oxidation of the H
2
S to sulphur is effected while  
 

operating at temperatures which are maintained 
throughout the entire duration of the period of 

contact at values selected between 80°C and 140°C 
in order to oxidise substantially quantitatively 

to sulphur the H
2
S present in the gaseous effluent 
without forming SO
2
 and to deposit nearly all of 
the sulphur formed on the catalyst and to obtain a 

purified current of gas which is practically free 
from H
2
S. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the molar ratio O
2
:H
2
S is 
from 0.5 to 1.5. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the contact time of the 

gaseous reaction medium, formed by the gaseous 
effluent containing H
2
S and by the gas containing 
free oxygen, with the oxidation catalyst has a 

value of from 0.5 second to 20 seconds, under 
normal pressure and temperature conditions. 
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the contact time is from 1 

second to 15 seconds. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the oxidation catalyst

more oxides and/or salts of transition metals 
selected from nickel, cobalt, iron, copper, 

silver, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten 
and vanadium, and that is deposited on a support 

selected from bauxite, alumina, titanium oxide, 
zirconium oxide, zeolites, silica/alumina 

mixtures, silica/titanium oxide mixtures, silica 
and activated carbon. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the oxidation catalyst 

has a pore volume, determined by the mercury 
penetration method, of from 150 cm
3
 to 600 cm

litre of catalyst. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the active phase of 

the oxidation catalyst, calculated by weight of 
metal, represents from 0.1 to 15% of the weight of 

the catalyst. 
Process according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the active phase of the 

oxidation catalyst, calculated by weight of metal, 
represents from 0.2 to 7% of the weight of the 

catalyst.  
 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that the oxidation 

catalyst, charged with sulphur, is subjected 
periodically to regeneration by sweeping with a 

non-oxidising gas while operating at temperatures 
of between 200°C and 500°C in order to vaporise 

the sulphur retained on the catalyst, then the 
regenerated catalyst is cooled to a temperature of 

between 80°C and 140°C for a fresh implementation 
of the oxidation reaction, this cooling being

to 12, characterised in that the maintenance of 

the temperature for the bringing into contact of

said fractions having substantially equal volumes. 
Process according to Claim 14,
