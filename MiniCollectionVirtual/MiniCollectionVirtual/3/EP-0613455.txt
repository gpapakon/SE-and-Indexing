<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a composite material which comprises ceramic fibres in a matrix of a ceramic material. A woven matt of ceramic fibres having an electrically conductive coating thereon is immersed in a sol comprising surface charged ceramic particles. A potential difference is then applied between the fibres and a further electrode placed in the sol. The applied potential difference is continued until the matt has been fully permeated by the ceramic particles. The matt is then removed from the sol and subsequently heated to provide sintering of the permeating ceramic particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
a composite material and is particularly concerned with a 
method of manufacturing a composite material using 
electrophoresis. It is well known that certain characteristics of 
some materials can be enhanced by reinforcing those 
materials with a suitably configured structure formed 
from a different material. In a typical example, the 
strength characteristics of one material can be enhanced 
by reinforcing that material with a different suitably 
strong material. In the field of ceramics it is frequently desirable 
to reinforce a ceramic matrix material with high strength 
fibres of, for instance, alumina or silicon carbide. 
Difficulties arise, however, in ensuring that the 
reinforcing fibres are completely infiltrated by the 
ceramic matrix material. One method of infiltrating reinforcing fibres with a 
ceramic matrix material is by the use of chemical vapour 
infiltration. In that technique, the fibres are placed 
in an atmosphere of a suitable vapour which is caused to 
chemically break down to deposit a ceramic material on 
the fibres. Ceramics such as silicon carbide can be 
deposited in this way. However it is a slow process 
which is expensive to carry out. In addition, it does 
have a tendency to produce a matrix material which has 
some degree of undesirable porosity. Another technique is one which utilises liquid phase 
reaction. This involves infiltrating the reinforcing 
fibres with a liquid which progressively oxidises or 
reacts with a gaseous medium to form a ceramic matrix 
material. For instance, the fibres could be infiltrated 
by molten aluminium which is caused to oxidise to alumina 
as it infiltrates. The drawback with this technique is that there is 
only a small range of materials which are suitable for  
 
use with it. Additionally there is the danger that 
unreacted metal could be left in the matrix material and 
the matrix material does tend to exhibit a certain degree 
of porosity. A still further technique is one in which the 
reinforcing fibres are infiltrated with a liquid glass 
precursor material which is subsequently crystalised to 
form a ceramic product. The difficulty with this technique is that of the 
limited range of glass precursor materials which are 
available. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a method of manufacturing a composite material in which 
such difficulties are substantially avoided. According to the present invention, a method of 
manufacturing a composite material comprises
