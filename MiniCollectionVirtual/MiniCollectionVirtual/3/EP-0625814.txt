<ABSTRACT>
The power supply control device includes two regulation modes, a linear regulation and a switched-mode regulation. A current IT1 from a sensor T1, rectified by diodes (8, 9, 10, 11), feeds a power supply circuit including a storage capacitor (14) and a regulation transistor (13). A resistor (21) and a control circuit (22) measure the value of the current and, through a selector (23), select the regulation mode. If the current is lower than a predetermined threshold the regulation is linear, the base of the transistor (13) is linked to a Zener diode (19). When the current exceeds a predetermined threshold, the regulation is in switched mode and the base of the transistor (13) is linked to the output of a comparator (16).
