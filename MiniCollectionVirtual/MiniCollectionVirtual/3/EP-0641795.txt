<ABSTRACT>
Known carbapenem derivatives such as thienamycin have disadvantages that they are physicochemically unstable and 
readily decomposed by enzymes such as DHP of the kidney to bring about adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, while 1-β-methylcarbapenem 

compounds are stable and have potent antibacterial activities but are yet unsatisfactory as regards the stability 
and antibacterial activity against DHP. Under these circumstances the invention provides an antibiotic represented by general 

formula (I) which has a potent antibacterial activity against various bacteria including 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
 and is excellent 
in safety and stable against hydrolases such as DHP, and a salt thereof (I), wherein R¹ represents lower alkyl or optionally protected 

hydroxy lower alkyl; R², R¹³ and R¹⁴ represent each hydrogen or lower alkyl; R³ represents optionally esterified carboxy 
R⁴, R⁹, R¹⁰ and R¹⁵ represent each an amino-protective group, hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁵, R⁶, R¹¹ and R¹² represent 

each hydrogen, hydroxyl, lower alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl or halogen, or alternatively R⁵ and R⁶ and/or R¹¹ and R¹² 
may combine together to form alkylene; R⁷ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, carboxyl, carbamoyl or -CONR⁷¹R⁷²; R⁷¹ and 

R⁷² represent each hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁸ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl or hydroxy lower alkyl, or alternatively R⁸ 
may combine with R⁷ to form alkylene; Z represents a single bond, oxygen, sulfur, -CR¹¹R¹²-, -NR¹³CO-, -CONR¹⁴- or 

-NR¹⁵-; and m and n represent each an integer of 0 to 6.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel antibiotics having a 
carbapenem skelton. Thienamycin having a carbapenem skelton has been 
regarded as a promising new antibiotic since its discovery in 
1976, because it is effective upon bacterial strains which 
are resistant against prior art antibiotics and it can 
exhibit excellent antibacterial activity. However, thienamycin and various other carbapenem 
derivatives reported thereafter have to be used as a mixed 
preparation with a dehydropeptidase (DHP) inhibitor, because 
they are not only physico-chemically unstable but also apt to 
be decomposed by DHP and the like enzyme in the kidney, 
thereby causing side-effects such as renal toxicity. In addition, an unexamined published Japanese Patent 
application No. JP-A-60-233076 discloses 1-β-methylcarbapenem 
compounds which are stable against β-lactamase producing 
strains, have physico-chemically stable nature and exhibit 
strong antibacterial activity. These compounds, however, are 
still unsatisfactory in terms of their stability against DHP 
and antibacterial activity.  
 The inventors of the present invention have conducted 
intensive studies with the aim of finding a carbapenem 
derivative having more excellent properties and, as the 
results, have accomplished the present invention by finding a 
compound which is effective upon various bacterial strains 
including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, excellent in terms of 
safety and stability against hydrolases such as DHP and the 
like. The present invention relates to a carbapenem 
derivative represented by the following general formula (I), 
and a salt thereof; 
 
wherein 
R1 represents a lower alkyl group or a hydroxy lower 
alkyl group which may have a protecting group; R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; R3 represents a carboxyl group which may be esterified; R4 represents an amino group-protecting group, a hydrogen 
atom or a lower alkyl group;  
 R5 and R6, which may be the same or different, each 
represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkyl 
group, a hydroxy lower alkyl group or a halogen atom, and R5 
and R6 may together form an alkylene group having 2 to 6 
carbon atoms; R7 represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a 
carboxyl group, a carbamoyl group, a carboxyl group which may 
have a protecting group, or a partial structure 
represented by -CONR71R72 where R71 and R72, which may be the 
same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a lower 
alkyl group; R8 represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a
