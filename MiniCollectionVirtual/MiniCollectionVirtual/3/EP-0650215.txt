<ABSTRACT>
A rod antenna element (11) is connected at its lower end 
to one end of a coaxial impedance converter, the other end 

of which is connected to a feeder (14). A coil antenna element (16) 
is capacitively coupled to the rod antenna element to 

provide a double resonance characteristic. When held at its 
retracted position, the rod antenna element, inserted in an 

outer conductor of the coaxial impedance converter, may 
preferably form an inner conductor larger in diameter than 

that when the rod antenna element is at its extended-out 
position, and the rod antenna element is connected to a 

coil antenna element with a low impedance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna equipment for use with automobile, portable and
cordless telephones and other mobile station radio units.The mobile radio communication network has been steadily extended to meet a growing demand
for daily use and cannot be accommodated in a single frequency band conventionally assigned
thereto; now, it is assigned one more frequency band. It is desired, therefore, that every mobile
station equipment be switchable between these two frequencies -- this calls for an antenna
equipment that resonates with two different frequencies. Figs. 1 and 2 show prior art examples
of such an antenna equipment adapted for resonance with two frequencies. In the example of
Fig. 1 a resonance circuit 7 is provided at a midpoint in an antenna element 11 and has a
resonance frequency different from that of the antenna element 11, and besides, a matching
circuit 8 is connected between a feeder 14 and the antenna element 11 to match their
impedances. In the example of Fig. 2 the matching circuit 8 between the antenna element 11
and the feeder 14 is adapted to resonate with two frequencies.In the unit of Fig. 1 the matching circuit 8 is relatively simple in structure but the provision of the
resonance circuit 7 at a midpoint in the antenna element 11 introduces complexity in the
mechanical structure of the antenna equipment, and in general, the antenna element 11 readily
becomes crimped at that portion. In the example of Fig. 2 the matching circuit 8 is complex in
structure and the provision of such a complicated matching circuit 8 will increase the power loss
or dissipation by the antenna circuit accordingly. Besides, in the prior art examples of Figs. 1 and
2 an antenna current develops in an antenna housing 9 (indicated by a symbol of ground
potential); consequently, in a radio unit of the type that the housing is held by hand, the current
distribution varies with how the housing is held and with the movement of the human body,
causing a change in the radiation characteristic of the antenna. Furthermore, the antenna
characteristic itself is also affected by the shape and material of the housing and parts mounted
thereon (such as a dial pad and a liquid crystal display screen).In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 213303/87 there is disclosed an antenna
equipment of a construction in which a coaxial line of a length λ/4 (λ being the wavelength used)
and a characteristic impedance Zo is connected between the feeding point of a λ/2 rod antenna
and a feeder of a characteristic
