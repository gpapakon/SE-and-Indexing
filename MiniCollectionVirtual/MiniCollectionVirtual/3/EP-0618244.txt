<ABSTRACT>
A multiple curable composition is prepared from 
components consisting essentially of 


(a) an isocyanate adduct having (i) free 
isocyanate groups and (ii) free 

photopolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated 
groups, wherein the ethylenically 

unsaturated groups comprise in the range of 
10 to 70 % of the total of any free 

functional groups on said adduct; 
(b) reactive (meth)acrylate diluents; 
(c) optionally, photoinitiator and, 
(d) an organic peroxide. 
When cured, the above composition is particularly 
suitable as a conformal coating on electronic circuit 

boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an
ultraviolet (UV) light curable conformal coating
composition having two built-in secondary curing
mechanisms. The composition being useful as a
protective coating for electronic assemblies and as
encapsulant for electronic parts. By "conformal
coating", it is meant a coating which is applied so as
to conform to the features of the surface to be
coated, especially surfaces of electronic circuit
boards. By "secondary curing", it is meant the curing
which occurs through two mechanisms in shadowed areas
of a board.Conformal coatings were originally made to
protect military and aerospace electronic assemblies
from environmental factors such as humidity, dust and
chemical contaminants. These environmental factors
cause unprotected assemblies with delicate circuitry
to malfunction because of corrosion and electrical
shorting. As the electronic packaging becomes denser
with fine conductor spacings, the assemblies are even
more sensitive to the environmental factors. In
addition, the increasing use of electronics in
transportation and general industrial applications
caused the increased use of conformal coatings, mainly
for the protection of the electronics from their harsh
end-use environments.The most damaging and usually the most prevalent
contaminant generally is considered to be moisture or
humidity. Excessive moisture or humidity will 
drastically lower insulation resistance between
conductors, accelerate high-voltage breakdown and
dendritic growth, and corrode conductors. Other
contaminants which may damage printed circuit boards
include various chemicals such as residues of the
manufacturing process, such as solder fluxes, organic
solvents, release agents, metal particles and marking
inks, and contaminants which inadvertently may be
deposited by human handling such as body greases,
fingerprints, cosmetics and food stains. Ambient
operating conditions may also contribute a variety of
contaminants such as salt spray, dirt and dust, oil,
fuel, acid, corrosive vapor, and fungus. In all but
the more severe cases, the destructive action of these
contaminants can be effectively eliminated by
provision of a good conformal coating.In addition to providing protection from
contaminants, conformal coatings also provide a
certain degree of protection to mechanical shock,
vibration and tampering.Historically, the first commercial conformal
coatings were one and two-part systems whose main
constituents were acrylic, epoxy, silicone or
polyurethane resins. These resins were
