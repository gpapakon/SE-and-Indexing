<ABSTRACT>
A 3-dimensional circuit assembly includes a lower substrate 
(6a), a first integrated circuit (IC) layer (10b) 

that is adhered to and electrically insulated from the substrate 
(6a), electrical contacts (18) for the IC layer 

(10b), and separate electrical contacts for the substrate 
(6a) that extend through and are insulated from the IC layer 

(10b). The IC layer (10b) is surmounted by an insulating 
layer (8b) through which the electrical contacts (18) 

also extend, and across which interconnections (20) between 
different contacts may be made. The IC layer (10b) and 

substrate (6b) are held together by an adhesion layer (4), 
with the adhesion (4), IC (10b) and insulating (8b) layers 

all being thin enough to assume the coefficient of thermal 
expansion for the underlying substrate (6a), which is much 

thicker. The substrate (6a) may itself have a second IC 
layer (10a) to which contacts are made, or it may be implemented 

as the photodetector of a focal plane array. Two 
standard wafers (2a, 2b) are used to form the package, with 

the substrate (6b) for the upper wafer (2b) removed either 
before or after bonding to the lower wafer (2a). Additional 

IC layers (10c) may be added by adding additional wafers 
(2c) in a similar fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high density circuit packages,
and more particularly to three-dimensional circuit assemblies
and fabrication techniques for packaging either
multiple integrated circuit layers as a unitary assembly,
or a focal plane array together with associated readout
circuitry.In an attempt to increase the density of integrated
circuit (IC) packages, efforts have been made to incorporate
multiple circuit layers within the same package, with
various mechanisms for interconnecting the different layers
and providing externally accessible input/output ports. In
a similar vein, effort has also been directed towards integrating
the fabrication of a focal plane array with its
readout circuitry.One of the challenges in successfully implementing a
3-D circuit package has been to bring connections for the
interior circuit layers out to the exterior of the package
so they can be readily addressed by the user. One method
to accomplish this has been developed by Hughes Aircraft
Company, the assignee of the present invention, and is referred
to as the thermal gradient zone melt technique.
This approach is described in M.J. Little et al., "The 3-D 
Computer", Proc. of IEEE Int'l. Conf. on Wafer Scale Integration,Jan.
3, 1989, pages 55-64. It involves the distribution
of aluminum dots on the surface of a silicon wafer
within which circuit layers have been fabricated. A
device is heated to about 1,100° - 1,200° C, causing the
aluminum dots to melt and dissolve into the underlying silicon.
This produces a conductive feedthrough composed of
an aluminum/silicon alloy extending into the wafer from the
location of each dot, and having a much lower resistivity
than the surrounding silicon. The feedthroughs extend down
to the circuit layer and thereby provide an external electrical
access. While successfully producing feedthroughs
to the circuit layers, this technique is subject to density
limitations in the zone melts, and can result in a feed-through
capacitance that is excessive for certain applications.In the area of focal plane arrays, a "loop hole" or
"VIMIS" (vertically integrated metal-insulator-semiconductor)
technique has been developed in which a chip of photodetector
material is glued to readout circuitry. The
photodetector is then thinned, and openings are etched
through it to access contact pads for an integrated circuit
on the other side of the chip. The openings are then
metallized to provide electrical connections through the
detector to the readout circuitry. This technique is described,
