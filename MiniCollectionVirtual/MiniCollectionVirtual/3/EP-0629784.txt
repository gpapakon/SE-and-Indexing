<ABSTRACT>
A fastener system (100,100') for securing a multi-layer panel (200) 
having a first surface adapted to be secured to a substructure (300), a 

second surface awash in a fluid flowing thereacross, and a plurality of 
spaced fastener-receiving holes arranged in a predetermined array in the 

second surface. Each fastener (100,100') includes a threaded shank 
(112,112') having a diameter smaller than any of the fastener-receiving 

holes, a load-bearing flange (124,124') located adjacent the shank 
having a diameter greater than the shank diameter (112,112') for pressing 

the first surface of the panel against the substructure (300), an 
unthreaded shank (130,130') extending away from the load-bearing flange 

(124,124') and having a diameter smaller than the threaded shank 
diameter, and a second flange (140,140') having a diameter greater than 

the diameter of the load-bearing flange (124,124'). The second flange 
(140,140') is located on the side of the unthreaded shank (130,130') 

opposite the load-bearing flange (124,124'), and functions to seat 
against a recessed region of the second surface of the panel. A surface 

(148,148') on the second flange (140,140') adjacent the unthreaded shank 
(130,130') engages with and seals against a correspondingly configured 

recess (248a,248b) in the panel second surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reinforced laminar flow
control (LFC) structures used in aerospace applications, and more
particularly to a fastening system using threaded fasteners to secure truss core LFC
panel structures to underlying aircraft substructures, such that
the head of each fastener lies flush with, and seals the opening
In the outer surface of the LFC panel structure through which the
fastener has been inserted, while a load-bearing portion adjacent
the fastener threads functions to secure the panel structure to
the underlying substructure. Recently, designers of aerospace vehicles have developed
skin or panel structures which facilitate conformance of
moving air or other fluid to the surface over which it flows.
Such structures, known as laminar flow control (LFC) structures,
in recent years have taken the form of reinforced truss core
panel members. These panel members must be secured to underlying
airframe substructures via suitably chosen fastening systems.One of the most critical difficulties in securing these
structures to the airframe is in maintaining the precision of fit
of the secured parts. Often manufacturing tolerances of the
panel structures as well as the fastening mechanisms present the
greatest obstacles in achieving the desired precision. To
overcome,this problem, fastening systems of various forms have
been tried, from simple fasteners, such as rivets or bolts, to
more complex devices, such as intricate latching mechanisms.
Still, precision of fit remains a problem.Moreover, the key objective of today's aerospace
industry is to achieve optimum laminar flow. Thus, flow
contacting surfaces of fastened panels, as well as of the
fasteners securing the panels must present surfaces which act to
minimize turbulence of the moving fluid. To date, no known
system achieves these objectives.Attention is drawn to EP-A-0 209 778 which discloses a fastener
having a threaded shank together with a support ring and a bolt
shaft having an unthreaded shank and an end portion onto which a
screw head is mounted, on the side of said support ring opposite
said threaded shank. Said screw head having a diameter greater
than the diameter of said support ring.In accordance with the present invention a fastener system as
set forth in claim 1 is provided. Preferred embodiments of the
invention are disclosed in the dependent claims. It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a novel fastening system of laminar flow control panel
structures which will provide precise and secure

<CLAIMS>
A fastener system including a multi-layer laminar flow control (LFC) panel (200)
adapted to be secured to an underlying structure (300), and a plurality of fasteners (100, 100'),

the LFC panel having one surface (230) awash in a fluid flow and a plurality, of spaced fastener-receiving
holes arranged in a predetermined array,

one fastener being disposed in each of the fastener-receiving holes, each fastener including

a threaded shank (112, 112') for attaching the fastener to the underlying
structure, the threaded shank having a diameter smaller than any of the panel-receiving holes,
a load-bearing flange (122, 122') unitary with and located adjacent the
shank, the load-bearing flange having a diameter greater than the shank diameter and seating on

a first layer of the panel to urge the panel first layer into secure engagement
with the underlying support structure,
an unthreaded shank (130, 130') unitary with the load bearing flange and
extending away from the load-bearing flange on the side opposite the threaded shank, and
a non load-bearing second flange (144, 144'), having a diameter greater than said load bearing flange, on the side of the unthreaded
shank opposite the load-bearing flange, the second flange snugly engaging in a recess in a second layer which comprises the one

surface of the LFC panel awash in the fluid flow, so that the second flange presses against a
recessed region (248a, 248b) in the panel,
the second flange having a lower surface (148, 148') which is drawn
into sealing engagement against the recessed region in the LFC panel, and an upper surface

which is drawn flush with the one surface of the LFC panel to provide a substantially umbroken smooth surface, when the threaded shank is drawn
tightly into threaded holes in the underlying support structure.
The system of claim I, wherein the lower surface of the second flange (148') is
disposed at an angle to the unthreaded shank and the upper surface (100') is circular in plan.
The system of claim 1, wherein the second flange lower surface (148) comprises
a planar region disposed at substantially ninety degrees to the unthreaded shank.
The system of claim 1, wherein the LFC panel includes an upper layer (210),
a lower layer and a truss core (224) disposed between the upper and lower layers, the

truss core defining channels through which fluid can flow, and

   the unthreaded shank has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the threaded shank so
that when each fastener has been secured in its respective fastener-receiving hole, fluid flowing

in the channels passes therethrough without being obstructed by the unthreaded shanks.
The fastener system of claim 1, wherein the lower surface of the second flange is
coated with a sealing material.
The fastener system of claim 1, wherein the second flange snugly engages the
panel one surface without transferring loads thereto so that deformation of the one surface of the

LFC panel is prevented.
The fastener system of claim 1, wherein a fastener-driving means (160, 160') is
provided on the upper surface of the fastener second flange, the fastener-driving means

extending away from the second flange on the side thereof opposite the unthreaded shank, the
fastener driving means being rotatable relative to the fastener second flange when the fastener

has been secured to the underlying structure so that the fastener driving means separates from the
second flange leaving a substantially planar surface.
