Deflocculating polymer having hydrophilic backbone and one or more hydrophobic side chains, being a block copolymer having alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, or having nonionic monomers and ionic monomers, comprising monomer units containing a ketone group. These deflocculating polymers can for example be used in granular and liquid detergents, preferably in liquid detergent composition comprising a dispersion of lamellar droplets of detergent active material in an aqueous continuous phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to deflocculating polymers 
and liquid detergent compositions comprising such polymers, 
in particular to liquid detergent compositions that 
comprise a dispersion of lamellar droplets in an aqueous 
continuous phase. Several types of deflocculating polymers are described in 
the art. EP 346 995 describes deflocculating polymers 
having a hydrophilic backbone and one or more hydrophobic 
side-chains, WO 91/06622 describes deflocculating polymers 
being a block copolymer consisting of alternating 
hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, WO 91/06623 describes 
deflocculating polymers consisting of nonionic monomers and 
ionic monomers and GB 2 237 813 describes deflocculating 
polymers consisting of a hydrophobic backbone and one or 
more hydrophilic side-chains. Deflocculating polymers have been used in liquid 
detergents, in particular in liquid detergent compositions 
that comprise a dispersion of lamellar droplets in an 
aqueous continuous phase, as for example described in EP 
346 995, WO/91/06622, WO/91/06623 and GB 2 237 813. Other 
applications for deflocculating polymers in general purpose 
cleaners, liquid abrasive cleaners, liquid bleach 
compositions are disclosed in WO/91/09108, in fabric 
softening compositions in EP 415698 and the use in granular 
detergent compositions is disclosed in WO/91/09932. WO/91/09109 discloses liquid detergent compositions 
comprising deflocculating polymers that are biodegradable. As a consequence of consumers' and manufacturers' awareness 
for environmental issues, a trend can be seen to more 
development and more appreciation of "green" products, i.e.  
 
products with ingredients that are biodegraded quicker and 
easier, i.e. to search for ingredients that will result in 
an improved biodegradability of products. Surprisingly, applicants have found a way to improve the 
biodegradability of deflocculating polymers. These improved polymers do not suffer from loss of the 
beneficial deflocculating effects in liquid or granular 
detergent compositions. The improvement can be established 
by inclusion of a particular group in the hydrophilic 
backbone of the polymer, resulting in the polymers becoming 
better biodegradable. The matter for which protection is sought is 
defined in claims 1 to 8.  
 Generally the hydrophilic backbone of the polymer is 
predominantly linear; the main chain or the backbone 
constitutes at least 50%, preferably more than 75%, most 
preferred more than 90% by weight of the polymer. Monomer 
units suitable for
