<ABSTRACT>
A fuel rod has a cladding made of a thicker inner layer (4) to which is metallurgically bound a thinner outer layer (5). In view of the conditions prevalling inside the cladding tube and the mechanical properties of the whole cladding tube, the inner layer is made of zircaloy with a relatively high Sn content and a low Fe and Fe+Cr content. The outer layer too contains practically only zircaloy components, but in view of corrosion, H2 absorption and sensitivity to Li dissolved in the cooling water, the Fe and Fe+Cr content is higher than that of the inner layer, or at least not lower, the Sn content is lower than 1.3 % and the Sn+Fe+Cr content exceeds 1.0 %. Low failure quotas of the cladding tube are thus obtained even with a long service life.
