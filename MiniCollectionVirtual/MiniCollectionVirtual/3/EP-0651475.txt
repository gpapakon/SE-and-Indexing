<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
demultiplexing module, as well as an optical multiplexing 
module that are used with amplifiers in fiber optics 
communication. The invention also relates to housings for such 
optical demultiplexing and multiplexing modules. Optical amplifiers capable of direct amplification of 
optical signals are being the subject of active development 
efforts since they can be used as repeaters to compensate for 
the attenuation of optical signals due to the transmission loss 
and other factors of optical fibers. Of a particular interest 
are optical amplifiers that use rare-earth doped fibers as 
amplifying media because of their small polarization-dependence 
and low-noise characteristics. Such optical amplifiers can be implemented by two 
methods; one is by combining rare-earth doped fibers with fiber 
optics couplers and the other by combining the fibers with 
optical devices such as a multiplexer, a beam splitter and an 
optical isolator. The present invention concerns the second 
method of implementation. A conventional system that adopts 
this method is shown in Fig. 9, in which signal light is  
 
combined with pumping light by means of a multiplexer 53 and 
the combined light is admitted into a rare-earth doped fiber 10 
(for details, see Unexamined Published Japanese Patent 
Application (kokai) Hei 4-128718). Another conventional system 
uses a prism to combine the signal light with the pumping light 
(for details, see C-262 in the Collected Papers Read at the 
Spring Conference of The Institute of Electronics, Information 
and Communication Engineers, 1992). If the optical devices used in an optical amplifier are 
largely dependent on polarization and wavelength, the 
characteristics of the amplifier per se are adversely affected 
to a large extent. To avoid this problem, the optical devices 
such as a multiplexer and a wavelength selecting filter are 
adapted to admit light at a smaller incident angle or otherwise 
modified so that they have no dependence on polarization or 
wavelength. In the system configuration shown in Fig. 9, an optical 
fiber 51 is mounted at an angle with respect to the multiplexer 
53 and this is in order to avoid the dependence on polarization 
and wavelength by insuring that the angle of incidence ϑ on the 
multiplexer 53 is sufficiently small. However, it is a 
disadvantage for producing that various optical devices are 
fixed so as to inclined with respect to the sides of the 
housing during the assembling because it consumes much
