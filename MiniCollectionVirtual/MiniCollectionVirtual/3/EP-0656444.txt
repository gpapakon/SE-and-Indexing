<ABSTRACT>
A pulp moulding is made by supporting mesh (22) on 
a shaped support (20) made by or from laminated object 

manufacture. The support (20) is provided with drainage 
channels (21) through which water is drawn to deposit pulp 

(24,25) on the mesh (22). The mesh may be ordinary wire 
mesh, or may be made by stereolithography.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making 
pulp mouldings. It is known to mould articles from paper pulp and 
the like. For example, egg cartons and other packaging 
items are commonly made in this way. In recent times, there 
has been a move to replace conventional expanded polystyrene 
and other plastics packaging items by corresponding pulp 
products, both to achieve economies and for ecological 
reasons. However, current manufacturing techniques for pulp 
products, whilst perfectly satisfactory for fairly crude 
items such as egg boxes, do not easily permit the production 
of more sophisticated items. In general, pulp products are made by providing a 
mesh mould, feeding an aqueous pulp to one side of the 
mould, and applying a vacuum to the other side of the mould 
to draw water through the mesh, thus leaving the solids 
(fibres) deposited on the mesh. The wet moulded solids are 
then removed and dried to form the moulded product. The 
mesh moulds for these processes are largely hand-made and, 
especially for complex shapes, can take a long time to make. 
In one typical procedure, individual pieces of wire mesh are 
shaped and located on a support member, and joined to 
adjacent pieces to build up a complete mould. It will be appreciated that it is very difficult 
by these conventional procedures to make anything but 
relatively simple moulded products. Furthermore, it is 
difficult if not impossible to make very accurately  
 
dimensioned and shaped products. These limitations of the 
production process result in severe limitations on the sort 
of products which can be made by this technique. We have now devised an improved way of 
manufacturing moulded pulp products by which much greater 
control can be exercised over the mould production, and 
whereby much more sophisticated products of much wider 
variety can be made. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a process for making a pulp moulding which 
comprises feeding an aqueous pulp to one side of a mesh 
mould, and reducing pressure on the other side of the mould 
to draw water through the mould, to form the pulp moulding 
on said one side of the mould; characterised in that the 
mould includes a shaped member made or derived by laminated 
object manufacture (LOM). Laminated object manufacture (usually abbreviated 
to LOM) is a process in which a shaped object is built up of 
layers of plastic coated paper, each individually cut by a 
laser and adhered to adjacent layers. The laser is computer 
controlled and the technique

A process for making a pulp moulding which 
comprises feeding an aqueous pulp to one side of a mesh 

mould, and reducing pressure on the other side of the mould 
to draw water through the mould, to form the pulp moulding 

on said one side of the mould; characterised in that the 
mould includes a shaped member made or derived by laminated 

object manufacture (LOM). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the shaped 
member is a plastics material mould derived from an LOM 

article. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the 
plastics mould comprises a shaped moulding surface and a 

series of water-conducting channels in the mould to conduct 
water from said moulding surface. 
A method according to claim 3, wherein the 
moulding surface has a plurality of apertures therein to 

constitute a mesh, the apertures communicating with said 
water-conducting channels. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein a 
mesh member is provided on said shaped member and, in use, 

water is drawn through the mesh to the shaped member. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein the mesh 
member comprises wire mesh or a mesh made by 

stereolithography (SLA). 
A method according to claim 3, wherein the size 
and/or disposition of the channels is such as to provide a 

pulp moulding of varying wall thickness but constant 

moulding density. 
A mould for use in making a pulp moulding, which 
mould comprises a plastics member having a surface of a 

shape derived in the moulding; a plurality of fine apertures 
formed in the surface; and a series of water-flow channels 

formed in the plastics member communicating with the 
apertures to carry water therefrom.
