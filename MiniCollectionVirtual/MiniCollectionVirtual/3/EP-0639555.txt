<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the 
isomerization of (interconversion) of linear and branched carboxylic acid. Burke U.S. Patent 4,939,298 discloses the isomerization of 
saturated alkyl carboxylic acids having 4 to 20 carbon atoms and having at 
least one hydrogen on a beta carbon atom by heating the acids in a solvent in 
the presence of a rhodium catalyst promoted with an iodide or bromide and 
carbon monoxide. The present invention is an improvement and expansion of the 
subject matter of the '298 patent. The presence of aluminum in the reaction 
mixture results in a higher isomerization rate, and greater catalyst stability. 
The '289 patent discloses rhodium as the catalytic metal, and it has now been 
found that iridium in conjunction with an aluminum compound is also a 
satisfactory catalytic metal for this reaction. The present invention is a process for the isomerization of 
saturated alkyl carboxylic acids having 4 to 20 carbon atoms and having at 
least one hydrogen on a beta carbon atom, which comprises heating a 
reaction medium containing said saturated acid, a solvent for said saturated 
acid, an aluminum iodide or aluminum bromide promoted rhodium or 
iridium catalyst, and carbon monoxide to a temperature in the range of 170 to 
250 degrees C at a carbon monoxide pressure of 13.8 to 689.5 bar (200 to 10,000 psi), where the 
amount of iodide or bromide promoted rhodium or iridium catalyst is in the 
range of 0.005 to 0.50% by weight of rhodium or iridium metal based on the 
weight of the reaction medium. The conversion may be from a branched 
compound to a linear compound, or from a linear compound to a branched 
compound, or from a branched compound to an isomeric branched 
compound. The rhodium or iridium catalyst may be formed in-situ by 
adding a rhodium compound or a iridium compound and a suitable 
aluminum iodide compound or aluminum bromide compound to the other  
 
components of the mixture to be reacted. Alternatively, aluminum and iodide 
or bromide may be added separately to the mixture, or the promoted catalyst 
may be prepared prior to addition to the mixture. The aluminum iodide or 
bromide may also be formed in-situ from suitable aluminum and iodide 
precursors. Aluminum tri-iodide is the preferred promoter. The isomerization may be carried out in a solvent for the 
compound being isomerized. Lower aliphatic acids are suitable, and acetic 
acid is satisfactory. Other solvents are aliphatic halides such a methylene 
chloride, aromatic solvents such as

A process for the isomerization of saturated alkyl carboxylic 
acids having 4 to 20 carbon atoms and having at least one hydrogen on a beta 

carbon atom, which comprises heating a reaction medium containing said 
saturated acid, a solvent for said saturate acid, an aluminum iodide or 

aluminum bromide promoted rhodium or iridium catalyst, and carbon 
monoxide to a temperature in the range of 170 to 250 degrees C at a carbon 

monoxide pressure of 13.8 to 689.5 bar (200 to 10,000 psi), where the amount of iodide or 
bromide promoted rhodium or iridium catalyst is in the range of 0.005 to 

0.50% by weight of rhodium or iridium metal based on the weight of the 
reaction medium. 
The process of claim 1 in which the aluminum component of 
the aluminum iodide or aluminum bromide promoted rhodium or iridium 

catalyst is added in a form other than aluminum iodide or aluminum bromide. 
The process of claim 1 in which the saturated acid is 2-methylglutaric 
acid and said acid is isomerized to adipic acid. 
The process of claim 1 in which the molar ratio of 

aluminum to iodide or bromide is in the range of about 1/5 to 2/1.
