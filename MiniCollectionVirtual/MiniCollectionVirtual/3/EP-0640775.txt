<CLAIMS>
A vibration absorber comprising a dimensionally 
stable inertial mass which is gripped fast by a spring 

element made of rubber-elastic material, characterized in 
that a metallic clamping element (3) is attached to the 

spring element (2) and in that the clamping element (3) and 
the inertial mass (1) are fixed to one another 

nonpositively. 
A vibration absorber according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the inertial mass (1) has a projection 

(4) and in that the clamping element (3) has an entry 
opening (5) which is pressed onto the projection (4). 
A vibration absorber according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the projection (4) has a cross-section 

which increases in the press-on direction (6). 
A vibration absorber according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the inertial mass (1) has a 

recess (7) and in that the clamping element (3) is pressed 
into the recess (7). 
A vibration absorber according to claim 4, 
characterized in that the recess (7) has a cross-section 

which decreases in the press-on direction (6). 
A vibration absorber according to any of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the clamping element (3) extends 

essentially transversely to the longitudinal direction of 
the projection (4) and/or of the recess (7) and, in the edge 

region, has a profile which is deformed counter to the 
press-on direction (6). 
A vibration absorber according to any of claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the clamping element (3) 

projects beyond the profile of the spring element (2) at the  
 

edge by means of at least one fixing projecting (8). 
A vibration absorber according to claim 7, 
characterized in that the fixing projection (8) is covered 

with a layer (9) of rubber elastic material. 
A vibration absorber according to any of claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that the inertial mass (1) is 

produced by sand-casting and is machined by a method, which 
does not involve the formation of chips, in the region of 

the fixing projection (4) and/or of the recess (7).
