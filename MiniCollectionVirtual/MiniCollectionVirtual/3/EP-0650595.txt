<DESCRIPTION>
 UNIVERSAL STANDARD REAGENTS, METHOD OF PREPARING SAMEAND USE THEREOFThe present invention relates to a new class of chemical reagents for quantitatively measuring compounds containing reactive functional groups. The invention further relates to methods of preparing such reagents and using them. Specifically, the invention relates to a new class of chemical reagents which can be used as universal standards for quantatively measuring any compound which can form a derivative with the reagents when the compound is present in mixtures and together with homologues. More specifically, the reagents of this invention are organic chemicals which have specific moieties that can be measured quantatively, colorometrically, fluoroscopically, or by other spectral means such as UV, IR, NMR and ESR. Some of these reagents are new chemical compounds.It is thus an object of this invention to provide a new class of analytical reagents which can serve as universal standards for visual spectroscopic analysis of different compounds, without requiring comparison with a standard for each compound measured.Another object of the present invention is to provide analytical methods for measuring compounds quantitatively, with reagents whose molar ε and that of their derivatives is substantially constant.Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method of quantitatively measuring homologous compounds with a single standard reagent without requiring external standards. 

 A further object of the invention is to provide some new chemical compounds suitable for use as universal standard colorimetric or spectrometric analytical reagents.Until now, the common methods for quantitatively measuring chemical compounds having functional groups were based on the reaction of these compounds via their functional groups with a reagent, usually a chromophoric or fluorescent reagent, and measuring the derivative spectrometrically by comparing the absorption of this derivative with that of a known external standard of such a derivative compound. For example, the determination of amino acids with fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) as described by Sanger, Biochem. J., Vol. 45, p. 563 (1984), is carried out by converting the amino acids into their dinitrophenyl derivatives. The actual quantification of each amino acid is arrived at by comparing the UV absorption of the corresponding dinitrophenyl derivative with that of standard amino acid dinitrophenyl products, e.g., DNP-Gly, DNP-Ala, etc. The external standard, however, is different for each
