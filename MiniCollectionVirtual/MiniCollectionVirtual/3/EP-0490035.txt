<ABSTRACT>
The frame of known rackets manufactured by the single or dual seal tube method is hollow on the inside or filled with light foam. In terms of adequate stability, rackets of this type must therefore have a minimum thickness in order to be suitable for playing. The new racket (1) is to be constructed in such a way that its frame thickness can be reduced further. The new racket (1) has a frame height which is greater transversely to the plane in which the strings lie than the frame thickness in the string plane. The cross-section of the frame (2, 4, 5) is constructed to be solid in its central region (7) and has a channel-type hollow space (10, 11) in each case at its narrow ends (14, 15) facing away from one another in terms of height. It is possible in the new racket (1) to reduce the frame thickness further, for example to achieve a slimmer design and improved aerodynamic properties.
