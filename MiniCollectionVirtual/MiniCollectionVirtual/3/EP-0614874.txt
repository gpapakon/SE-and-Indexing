<ABSTRACT>
A compound (Ia) or (Ib) is prepared by reacting a compound (III) with a salt of a carboxylic (IIa) or dicarboxylic (IIb) acid in a polar aprotic solvent. The reaction can be carried out under pressure but also at normal atmospheric pressure or in the region of normal atmospheric pressure (especially between 0.10 bar and 2 bar). The product (Ia) or (Ib) formed is, in the latter case, continuously recovered as it is formed.
