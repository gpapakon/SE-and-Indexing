<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the extraction of 
organic pollutants from contaminated soils without further 
contaminating the soil with organic solvents. Remediation of soils contaminated with hazardous wastes is 
one of the most common environmental problem. Plants for the 
manufacture of fuel from coal and crude oil have contaminated 
soils with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
having toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. The 
light hydrocarbons used as solvents by the industry for 
several decades become deposited in the soil. Wood preserving 
facilities polluted soils with PAHs and creosote. Beside 
industrial wastes soils have been polluted with pesticides 
and insecticides, many of them poorly degradable and persist 
in the environment. The reuse of abandoned properties lead 
to the discovery of contaminants stored separately on secure 
landfills leaking from underground tanks. Soil decontamination can be effected through biological 
treatment, immobilization of contaminants, high pressure 
cleaning, incineration microbial oxidation, coagulation, 
solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, thermal 
desorption, soil vapor extraction, or other processes. Conventional 
means for removal of the volatile contaminants  
 
include pumping the ground water to the surface followed by 
air stripping with aboveground equipment, vacuum extraction 
of volatile subsurface contamination, or site excavation for 
physical removal of the contaminated soil. The biodegradation of contaminants at waste sites has been 
the focus of research recently. It is of lower cost, high 
effectivity, but time consuming. Months or years may be 
required to reduce the contamination to the acceptable 
level. Several techniques are being developed to improve 
biodegradation rates beyond what can be achieved by simply 
adding nutrients and water and adjusting soil pH. These 
approaches entail chemical and biological treatments to 
increase the bioavailability of pollutants to microorganisms 
for catabolism, the addition of growth substrates to promote 
cometabolism organic contaminants that cannot be degraded 
otherwise, and the addition of a specially developed mixed 
bacterial culture to ensure the presence of required types 
and quantities of the degrading biota. Research has revealed that the chief factor limiting the 
rate and extent of pollutants biodegradation of pollutants 
in contaminated soil is the mass transfer. Organic pollutants are effectively retained by soil particles 
of large
