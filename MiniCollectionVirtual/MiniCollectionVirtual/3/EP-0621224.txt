<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for 
forming the jambs for elevator landing 

doors in a door opening (3) in the wall 
(2) between the elevator shaft and the 

landing. The jambs (4) consist of a skeletal 
structure (15,16,17) placed at the 

sides and at the top of the door opening 
and supporting the jamb structure, said 

skeletal structure being fastened to the 
wall by means of brackets (9) in a manner 

permitting adjustment in the direction of 
the plane of the door opening. Attached 

onto the skeletal structure is a surface 
structure (27,28) adjustable in the 

direction of the thickness of the wall. 
Each skeletal structure module is fixed 

to a bracket (9) in such a way that the 
position of the skeletal structure module 

can be adjusted in the direction of the 
plane of the door opening separately on 

the shaft side and on the landing side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lining frame
for elevator landing doors.
The lining frame is hereinafter designated as jambs.The openings for landing doors in the wall of an elevator
shaft are usually made somewhat larger than the minimum size
required for the installation of a door in the opening. This
is because, in paractical building work, inaccuracies inevitably
occur, with the result that the actual positions of
the doors differ somewhat from the designed ideal positions.
In other words, the positions of the door openings on different
floors differ horizontally from each other in relation
to the vertical line of the elevator car. For the
delivery and/or installation of the door jambs, this often
involves drawbacks or difficulties such as the following,
depending on the type of jambs used:
The jambs have to be measured only after the installation
of the landing doors and manufactured separately for each
case.The builder cannot finish the building until after the
jambs have been installed.Even jambs allowing adjustment require sawing and cutting
of parts at the site of installation.Sending people to take door measurements on site is
expensive.The material used in the doors looks different from jambs
made locally, because the materials used often come from
different suppliers or at least from different consignments.FR-A 2 211 390 discloses an adjustable lining structure for an elevator landing and
for attachment to a fixed entrance frame, having a cladding structure comprising two pieces
which are to be mounted between the frame and the wall around
the landing opening. This cladding structure is adjustable in
thickness direction as well as in the plane of the frame and
thus allows to be adapted to openings of different size and
wall thickness. However, this solution has the disadvantage
that the frame together with its cladding structure is of an
inhomogeneous appearance as there are always steps between
frame and cladding structure which are on the one hand not very
attractive and which on the other hand require more cleaning
work. To solve the problems described above, a new
lining frame for elevator landing doors is presented as
an invention. The invention is characterized
by what is presented in claim
1. Other embodiments of the invention are characterized by
the features presented in the other claims. The advantages
provided by the invention include the following:
The structure of the invention allows the elevator doors
and jambs to be ordered at the same time. As the jambs can
be ordered
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Adjustable lining frame for an elevator landing door to be
mounted in an opening (3) in the wall between the elevator

shaft and the landing,

comprising

a skeletal structure (15,16,17) being attachable to the
wall (2), supporting a surface structure of the frame and

provided with means for distance adjustment (10) in the
direction of the plane of the wall (2) to allow the skeletal

structure to be fitted in place in the opening (3), and
the surface structure comprising two cladding pieces
(27,28) attachable to the skeletal structure (15,16,17) and

adjustably attachable to each other in the direction of the
thickness of the wall (2).
Frame according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the skeletal structure comprises
a plurality of modules (15,16,17), each of which is so designed

that is adjustably attachable to at least one bracket (9) fixed
to an edge of the opening (3) in the wall (2).
Frame according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that

each skeletal structure module (15,16,17) is attachable to the
bracket (9) so that the position of a modul of the skeletal

structure is adjustable in the direction of the plane of the
door opening (3) separately on the shaft side and on the

landing side.
Frame according to claim 3,
characterized
 in that on the shaft side, the distance
adjustment is effected by means of three parts (23,14,31)

overlapping each other and forming a head joint with the wall
(2) whereas on the landing side the skeletal structure module

(15,16,17) at least partially overlaps the wall (2).
