<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector 
(10)
 provides for termination 
of shielded electrical cable 
(12)
. The connector includes an 
electrically insulative housing 
(20)
 supporting plural electrical 
contacts 
(44)
. A conductive contact shield 
(66)
 is positioned within 
the housing for electrically shielding the contacts. The 

housing further includes a strain relief device 
(100)
 operable to 
frictionally secure the cable to the housing. The ground 

clip 
(120)
 is positioned within the strain relief device for 
engagement with the cable shield upon cable termination. 

The ground clip 
(120)
 is also resiliently engageable with the 
contact shield 
(66)
 upon insertion of the contact shield into the 
housing. The engagement of the contact shield with the 

ground clip establishes electrical continuity between the 
cable shield and the contact shield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
improvements in electrical data connectors. More
particularly the present invention relates to a shielded
compact data connector which permits the transmission of
signals at high data rates.In the field of data/communications technology,
information in the form of electrical signals is being
transmitted at ever increasing speeds. Along with the
desire to transmit information at faster data rates, the
industry has also seen the need to reduce the size of
hardware employed so as to increase portability and ease of
use. In order to keep pace with these improvements, the
interconnection technology, which includes electrical cables
and electrical connectors designed to connect such hardware,
has also undergone significant changes. Electrical
connectors and cables are now available which are much
smaller in size and capable of transmitting data at higher
rates.Continued improvement in connection technology is
not without problems. When decreasing the size of
electrical connectors while requiring the connectors to
transmit data at higher rates, cross-talk between adjacent
conductive components of the connector becomes a factor
which must be addressed. Additionally, as these components
are normally used in close proximity to other electronic
components, the individual connector components must be
shielded from electro-magnetic interferences and radio-frequency
interferences. These interferences can adversely
affect the performance levels of the connectors especially
at higher data rates. An additional demand on connector technology is that
the connector components must be "user friendly". That is,
the components must be easy to assemble as well as easy to
connect and disconnect. Further, the portability of many
electronic components requires that these connections and
disconnections be repeated many times. A connector must be
able to withstand the rigors of repeated interconnection
without degradation of mechanical or electrical performance.It can be appreciated that merely "downsizing" a
connector will be insufficient to meet the current
requirements of the industry. Smaller connectors must be
designed to meet increased signal transmission requirements,
and provide for internal and external shielding as well as
long term reliable mechanical performance.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an electrical connector for terminating shielded multi-conductor
electrical cable.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide a shielded electrical
