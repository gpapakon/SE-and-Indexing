<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of film composites (multilayer films) in which functional interlayers are applied by vapour-deposition between two substrates (films) in vacuo during production of the composite, where at least one nonmetallic, transparent functional interlayer which acts as a barrier layer and/or coupling layer is applied.

<CLAIMS>
Method of manufacturing laminated films without
laminating adhesive, in which, during the

production of the composite, at least one non-metallic
transparent barrier and connecting layer

having a thickness of between 10 and 1000 nm is
applied between two films by vapour deposition in

a vacuum, which layer is selected from the group
of the following compounds:

aluminium oxide, cerium oxide, hafnium oxide,
magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, silicon

monoxide, tantalum oxide, titanium dioxide,
titanium (3) oxide, titanium monoxide, yttrium

oxide, zirconium oxide, zirconium monoxide,
indium/zinc oxide, lead fluoride, calcium

fluoride, cerium fluoride, cryolite, lanthanum
fluoride, magnesium fluoride, neodymium fluoride,

thorium fluoride, cadmium sulphide, zinc sulphide,
lead telluride, cadmium telluride, zinc telluride,

cadmium selenide, zinc selenide, glass or mixtures
thereof.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the layer is applied between two films guided

against one another over vaporisation rollers.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that in addition a thin and transparent metal

layer is applied.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the layers are applied by

thermal vapour deposition. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the barrier and connecting

layer is applied by cathodic sputtering.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the films are selected from

the group: polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene,
polyamide, polycarbonate, re-generated cellulose,

cellulose acetate, polyhydroxy butanoic acid and
its copolymers, starch-based plastics materials or

plastics materials with a starch additive,
aliphatic polycarbonates and polyesters,

polypeptides, polysaccharides, paper, cardboard or
other bio-degradable materials, as well as

combinations of these as a composite or mixture or
in laminated form.
