<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel silane compound and
a method for preparing the compound. The silane compound is
useful as a water repellant for treating the surface of a
variety of construction materials such as wood, concrete and
marble.It has been known that alkoxysilane compounds carrying linear
alkyl groups are useful as water repellents for imparting
water repellency to the surface of a variety of construction
materials such as wood, concrete and marble. The longer and
bulkier the alkyl chain of an alkoxysilane compound is, the
higher the water repellency of the compound. However, a
silane compound having a long chain alkyl group has a high
melting point or a high boiling point and the alkyl group of
the silane compound should accordingly be limited in its
chain length from the viewpoint of the production and use
thereof. For this reason, a need has been existing for the
development of a bulky substituent-carrying alkoxysilane
compound which can easily be prepared and can easily be
handled.On the other hand, it has also been known that an
alkoxysilane compound having a bulky and less flexible 
substituent is useful as a silane coupling agent or a
component of a catalyst for polymerizing olefinic monomers.
Under such circumstances, a need has been existing for the
development of a novel alkoxysilane compound having a bulky
and less flexible substituent. EP-A-0 376 084 and EP-A-0 452 916 disclose organosilicon
compounds as components for polymerization catalysts.
Especially, tert-butyl cyclohexyl diethoxysilane and tert-butyl
cyclohexyl dimethoxysilane are disclosed.EP-A-0 488 759 discloses thexyl(C1 bis C4)alkyl dialkoxysilanes
including thexyl methyl dimethoxysilane and thexyl n-butyl
dimethoxysilane useful as water-repellent agents and additives
for olefin polymerization catalysts. An object of the present invention is generally to solve the
foregoing problems associated with the conventional techniques
and more specifically to provide a novel alkoxysilane
compound which has a bulky and less flexible substituent and
a hydrolyzable Si-OCH3 group as well as tert-butyl and
cycloalkyl groups as alkyl groups and which can easily be
prepared and handled and to provide a method for industrially
easily preparing the alkoxysilane compound.According to the present invention, a Grignard reagent
represented by the following general formula: R1MgX is
reacted with a silane compound represented by the following
general formula: (CH3)3CSiH(OR2)2 and then the resulting silane
compound: (CH3)3CSiHR1OR2 is
