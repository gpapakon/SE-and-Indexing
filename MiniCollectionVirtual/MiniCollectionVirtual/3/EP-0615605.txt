<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a heat accumulator consisting of a vessel having a wall (49, 52) which is at least partially heat-conducting, which vessel contains a material which exothermally absorbs and endothermally desorbs a heat-transporting substance, the absorbing and desorbing material in particular being sodium sulphide and being adhered to the wall (49, 50) of the vessel by means of a fibrous material (53), such as cellulose. Also provided is a process for the production of such a heat accumulator comprising applying a fibrous material to the inner wall of a closeable vessel, preferably via conducting protrusions, and subsequently contacting the absorbing and desorbing material being in a molten and/or hydrated state with the fibrous material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a chemical heat accumulator for the 
storage and/or release of heat, heat being stored or released in the form 
of chemical binding energy. A heat accumulator of this type consists of 
a vessel having a wall which is at least partially heat-conducting, which 
vessel contains a crystalline material which exothermally absorbs and 
endothermally desorbsa heat-transporting substance. When charging the 
accumulator, the heat-transporting substance (the sorbate) is vaporised 
from the absorbing and desorbing material. This vapour can condense in 
a condenser/vaporiser which is at a lower temperature than the 
accumulator. When discharging the accumulator the sorbate is vaporised 
in the condenser/vaporiser with absorption of heat and absorbed, at a 
higher temperature than that of the condenser/vaporiser, by the absorbing 
and desorbing material in the accumulator, with release of heat. In the present description the term "heat accumulator" is used to 
denote only the vessel in which the absorption and desorption take place, 
while the combination with a vaporiser/condenser and any connecting 
lines, which can be used as a heat pump, is indicated by the term 
"energy system". An energy system as indicated above has been disclosed in 
Netherlands Patent Application 7714490 and US Patent 4186794. In these 
publications calcium chloride and sodium sulphide are proposed as the 
absorbing and desorbing solid and water as the heat-transporting 
substance. A disadvantage of a system of this type is, however, that the 
solid is poured loosely, in the form of metal salt which may or may not 
be hydrated, round or in the heat exchanger and as a consequence of this 
the heat exchange between the absorbent/desorbent material and the heat 
exchanger is poor. A similar system is disclosed in European Patent 
Application 35871, aluminium compounds, which are poured into small 
containers, being used as absorbent/desorbent solid. This system also has 
the said disadvantage of poor heat transfer. Attempts have been made to solve the problem of the poor heat 
exchange by increasing the heat-conducting power by using additives 
having a high thermal conductivity (European Patent Application 129473) 
or by using absorbent/desorbent solids which themselves have a high 
thermal conductivity, as in European Patent Application 35871. However,  
 
solutions of this type have not led to a heat exchange which is such that 
rapid charging and discharging of the energy system is possible. Another 
disadvantage of
