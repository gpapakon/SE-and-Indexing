<ABSTRACT>
The multi-effect bullet for lightweight firearms has a truncated ogive shape and has a core of soft metallic material covered, except for the tip, by a case made of copper-rich brass, which case is closed by the base and ends in a ridge which delimits a slight concavity of the lead core in the form of a spherical cap, the curvature of which varies as a function of the calibre of the bullet. The bullet is characterised in that its effect depends on the nature of the target at which the bullet is fired, being capable of passing through obstacles whose resistance may correspond to that of a protective element, and expanding on impact into a material which behaves in a similar way to that of the human body, which gives the bullet qualities making it suitable for very varied uses, these qualities being high accuracy and armour-piercing as well as a high stopping power.
