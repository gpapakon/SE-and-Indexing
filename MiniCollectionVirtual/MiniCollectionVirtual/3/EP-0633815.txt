<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
insulated furnace roller, and in particular to such 
rollers employed in high temperature furnaces for 
heating or reheating metallic workpieces incident to 
their being processed, for example, by rolling. U.S. Patents Nos. 3,860,387 and 4,991,276, as 
well as U.K. Patent No. 429,626 relate to rollers for 
conveying workpieces, such as metal slabs, plates and 
strips in such furnaces. The disclosed rollers 
comprise inner arbors for supporting outer tubes, 
sleeves or tires which support the horizontally 
disposed workpieces as they pass through the furnace. 
The arbors of these patents are internally air or water 
cooled to structurally protect the arbors from the 
intense heat that may in the case of the U.S. patents 
be in excess of 1093°C [2000° F]. To further protect the arbors 
from being overheated, which would cause their 
structural failure, and to prevent the cooling effect 
of the arbors from adversely affecting the ability of 
the furnace to heat the workpieces to the desired 
temperature, insulation is provided for the rollers 
disclosed in the three patents between the arbors and 
the tubes, sleeves or tires. To a great extent the success of past roller 
designs to operate over a long period of time in the 
environment involved were directly dependent on the  
 
ability of the insulation scheme employed to effectively 
insulate the rollers in carrying out the above two 
objectives. Past designs have repeatedly failed to do this 
due to the nature and structure of the insulation used and 
the manner and technic of applying the insulation to the 
rollers. Adding to the problem is the fact that the 
rollers are caused to deflect under the weight of the 
workpiece. The past failures have revealed that what is 
needed is an insulation scheme that will bring together the 
proper types and structures of insulations and the manner 
and technic of applying the insulations to allow the 
rollers to operate in the severe conditions and roller 
deflection without the insulations quickly deteriorating 
and/or becoming detached from the rollers. Another example of an insulated furnace roller 
known in the art is disclosed in European Patent No. 
471218, which forms the basis for the pre-characterising 
part of the claims herein. In the roller construction of 
EP 471218, precompressed fibre mats of ceramic fibres are 
placed against the sides of the tires and the spaces 
between adjacent ceramic fibre mats of adjacent tires are 
filled with a composition,
