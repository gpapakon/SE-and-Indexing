<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with preserving the aesthetic appearance of 
architectural structures, e.g. buildings, freestanding walls, statuary, and asphalt 
roofing shingles. More specifically, the invention concerns the treatment of 
building materials to prevent or remove disfiguring growths such as dark 
streaks of algae. Concrete provides durable, inexpensive building facings, roofing tiles 
and statuary, but can quickly develop dark streaks due to algae growth. Other 
building materials such as wood, limestone and other stonework, masonry, 
glass and asphalt roofing shingles likewise can become streaked by algae. The 
discoloration of asphalt roofing shingles is particularly noticeable when their 
roofing granules have a light color. Concrete, stonework and masonry can be coated with silicones or 
silicates for water repellency, but such treatments do not prevent algae and 
other growths. Instead, it has been necessary to clean concrete periodically, 
usually with bleaches or phosphates, to remove algae growth. The cleaning 
operation is time-consuming and expensive and does nothing to inhibit recurring 
growth. Algae growth on the granules of asphalt roofing shingles can be virtually 
eliminated by incorporating copper into the silicate binder that holds the color 
to the roofing granules. However, doing so substantially increases the cost of 
manufacturing the shingles. If copper could be incorporated into concrete, it 
might likewise inhibit algae growth, but copper would interfere with the setting 
up of the concrete. Another way to minimize algae growth on asphalt shingles 
is to minimize its content of limestone filler, but this can be economically 
undesirable. Tin compounds can afford fungicidal wood protection as reported in 
Kizlink, "Tributyltin-N,N-dialkyldithiocarbamates as Fungicides for Wood 
Preservation Against Rot", JOCCA, Vol. 74, No. 9, 1991, pp 329-330. The  
 
Kizlink publication also cites prior publications concerning the application of tin 
compounds as corrosion inhibitors, fungicides for plastics, paper, and paper 
pulp, and as biocides. Unfortunately, tin compounds mentioned in the Kizlink 
publication are sufficiently soluble in water to release tin radicals which are 
potentially toxic. Because of this, it is believed that tin compounds have not 
been used commercially for treating wood or other building materials, although 
they have been used in marine paints where, until recently, there has been 
minimal concern for ecology. German Offenlegungsschrift DE 3828775
