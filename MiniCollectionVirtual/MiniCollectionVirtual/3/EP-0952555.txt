<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an image processing unit for a 
shooting game in which suitable images can be displayed 

according to a given situation, and in which more exciting 
and easy-to-manipulate images are displayed. Coordinate 

values for objects in three-dimensional virtual space are 
established on the basis of prerecorded object shape data, 

view point positions are established on the basis of 
distances x1 and x2 from predetermined objects defined in 

three-dimensional virtual space (for example, the positions 
are lower when the distance is shorter, and higher when the 

distance is longer), the coordinate values established as 
described above are received, and the coordinate values are 

converted to a visual field coordinate system as seen from 
the view points established in the manner described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
This device relates to an image processing unit and image processing method for generating images seen from a specific view point in three-dimensional virtual space, relates to a game machine featuring the use of this image processing unit and image processing method, and also relates to a medium on which is recorded a program for executing the image processing method. The present invention also relates to a game machine equipped with a stereo sound effects system.Game machines featuring the use of computer graphics include game machines in which a gun is used to kill enemies (such as "Virtual Cop," by Sega Enterprises). This type of game can be enjoyed by a single player or by several players.This type of game machine requires exciting images as well as images which can be surveyed in their entirety for the sake of playability. For example, when an enemy approaches, his trajectory should be shown and he should be displayed up close. In conventional game machines, players are individually rated, even in the case of multiple players, making collaboration between players irrelevant.An object of the present invention is to resolve such drawbacks by providing an image processing unit displaying images that are more playable and more exciting.An object of the present invention is also to provide a game machine allowing collaborative play between players to be rated.In this type of game machine, the player wears headphones to experience sounds recorded in the binaural format or the like according to a predetermined storyline.In this system (game machine), a simple stereo sound effects system can be constructed using a recording format in which speakers are positioned at the player's ear level.However, the player experiences prerecorded sounds with this format, which is unsuitable for video games and the like in which situations change in real time. Moreover, wearing headphones on the head while playing games is cumbersome and annoying for players.There are also stereo sound effects systems in which the sound signals that are input to left and right front speakers are processed and sent to left and right rear speakers, but realistic sounds are difficult to reproduce since two sound sources are distributed to the rear.Japanese laid open publication JP-08-071252 describes a method and device capable of detecting a direction, position, and inclination of a gun against a video screen. Light emitting bodies are arranged surrounding a video screen, and a CCD camera is provided on the barrel of a gun. An image
