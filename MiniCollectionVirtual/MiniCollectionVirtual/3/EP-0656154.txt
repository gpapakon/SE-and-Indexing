<ABSTRACT>
Sodium-sulphur accumulator cells are disposed of and recycled by crushing the cells in the presence of water, by separating the solid residual materials and by preparing an aqueous solution of Na-polysulfide. Variations in the reaction process allow the products thus obtained to be economically processed while minimizing secondary products.

A Process for the disposal of sodium-sulfur storage 
cells, characterized in that the storage cells are crushed 

or disintegrated in the presence of a non-inflammable fluid 
such as water and/or protective gas or under vacuum and the 

released chemicals of the cells are processed, while stirring, 
to form an aqueous sodium-polysulfide solution, 

whereupon the solid materials are separated from the 
solution, washed with water and are dumped on a dumping 

ground or supplied to a recycling process, and the solution 
is disintegrated forming sodium salt, hydrogen sulfide and 

sulfur. 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
nascent hydrogen is collected and, preferably, is used for 

heating purposes. 
The process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the solid materials of the cell are separated following 

disintegration or following the formation of the 
aqueous sodium-polysulfide solution. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the process is carried out within a 

temperature interval ranging from room temperature to 
200°C, and preferably at approximately 120°C. 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that, for recycling, the sodium-polysulfide 

solution is reacted with lye, preferably sodium hydroxide 
solution, or with acid, preferably sulfuric acid, optionally 

adding oxidants, particularly H₂O₂-solution.  
 
The process according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the reaction with sodium hydroxide solution and with H₂O₂ 

yields sodium sulfate, whereby the pH value is maintained 
above pH 8 during the reaction. 
The process according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the reaction with H₂SO₄ and H₂O₂-solution produces sodium 

sulfate and sulfur and that the products are subsequently 
separated. 
The process according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the separation of the sulfur is effected by way of heating 

the solution at least to the melt temperature of elementary 
sulfur, collecting the sulfur at the bottom of the reactor 

and draining the sulfur through the bottom valve. 
The process according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the reaction with acid, preferably sulfuric acid, yields 

sodium salt, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur. 
The process according to one or more of the claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that hydrogen sulfide gas which is 

produced when elementary sulfur is formed is oxidated in 
situ to sulfate. 
The process according to claim 9, characterized in that 
hydrogen sulfide is expulsed and reprocessed, and sulfur is 

collected and separated. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that washing water used in the reprocessing 

is, at least for the most part, recycled and is 
employed when crushing the cells and for dissolving the 

chemicals, respectively.  
 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the sodium salt is converted to 

sodium hydroxide solution and acid by way of electrodialysis. 
The process according to claim 13, characterized in 
that the regenerated acid is reused in the process. 
The process according to any one of the claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that if sodium sulfate is formed precipitation 

is effected with calcium oxide and the resultant 
gypsum and/or the resultant sodium hydroxide solution are 

supplied to a recycling process or marketed.
