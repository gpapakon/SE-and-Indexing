A method of assisting the piloting of an aircraft

in relief which are dangerous for said aircraft
in the field in front of the latter,

characterized in that:

on the basis of the maneuvering capabilities of the
aircraft, a hypothetical curve is calculated,

related to said aircraft and associated with an

optimal theoretical trajectory for clearing an
obstacle in a vertical plane; and
in the field in front of the aircraft, the following
steps are performed:


a) all the obstacles situated in a search area are
determined;
b) the tops of said obstacles determined are compared
with said hypothetical curve;
c) that obstacle is defined as dangerous obstacle

said hypothetical curve; and
d) the coordinates of said top of this dangerous
obstacle are communicated.

sectors, said steps a, b, c and d are performed.
The method as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that, in each of said angular sectors, the coordinates

of a reference point situated at a predefined distance
above the top of the dangerous obstacle are calculated,

said predefined distance corresponding to the minimum
desired height for overflying an obstacle.

characterized in that an optimal avoidance point is

determined, corresponding to the point of the piloting

perform the optimal avoidance trajectory above the
