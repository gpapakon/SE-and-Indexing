<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process of manufacturing an exothermic reflexible glass which can emit heat of over 50  DEG C by coating the matrix glass with a thin layer of such metals as Cr, Ni, Au, Ag, Al, Cu by use of the sputtering technique for plasma, and a process of manufacturing an exothermic transparent glass whose surface temperature can be adjusted to a desired degree by means of connecting to a power source, after coating the matrix glass with a thin layer of transparent material of indium-tin oxide by use of the reactive sputtering technique and also to the glass produced respectively by these processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Exothermic Reflexible Glass, Exothermic Transparent Glass and Process of manufacturing them BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of Invention This invention relates to the exothermic reflexible glass and exothermic transparent glass as well as to a process for the manufacture of them, whose surface temperature can be adjusted at will by means of coating non-conductive glass either with reflexibility-conductive material or transparency-conductive material by use of the sputtering technique generally used for plasma. Description of Prior ArtThe technique of vacuum evaporation by sputtering, the very technique of manufacturing exothermic reflexible glass and exothermic transparent glass here, is performed by a direct evaporation of the material to be evaporated in vacuum through colliding ionized inert gas into the surface of the target, that is, ionization of the inert gas takes place in the area of abnormal glow discharge and the thus ionized gas, under the influence of the electric field, is made to beat the surface of a cathode. Ihus, in the sputtering technique, the target isused as the cathode and the vacuum container or the matrix, as the anode.A simplest diode planar sputtering technique is shown in Fig. 1, wherein a lowpressure electric discharge takes place between the targetO), which is used asthe cathode, and the anode. The pressure of the inert gas in common use should,for the purpose of maintaining electric discharge, be over 5 X 10"3 torr, the working pressure ranging from 2 X 10"2 torr to 10"! torr. The electric pressure applicable to the cathode can be varied from hundreds of volts to thousands of 

 volts, while the distance between the cathode and the matrixCvacuum container), the anode, is so near as about 5cm. The velocity of vacuum evaporation being about lOOA/min, it is decided according to the energy and quantity of the ion being shot out. That is, the velocity of vacuum evaporation can be increased by raising the electric pressure and restricted by the decrease of the ionized cross section.However, even though the ionized electric current can be increased by added pressure of inert gas, the velocity of vacuum evaporation can rather be decreased in an effect of dispersion of the gas. Thus, the optimum condition as to the velocity of the vacuum evaporation will have to be determined only throughrepeated experiments.To see the basic idea of the sputtering it is known that when a certainpressure and electric tension are applied to a targetO), which exists within avacuum container,
