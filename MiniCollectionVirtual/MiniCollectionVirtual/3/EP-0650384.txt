<ABSTRACT>
A method is described which allows two hazardous waste products, namely PVC and electric arc furnace dust, both of which have negative commercial value, to be combined to produce an iron oxide suitable for steel making, pure cadmium, lead and zinc and chlorine all of which can be sold. The heat generated during the exothermic reaction may be used to generate electricity which may be sold or used in plants where the reaction is carried out. The method can also be used for metallic scrap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating materials 
comprising or including polyvinylchloride (PVC), chlorinated 
rubber and other chlorinated polymers. PVC, especially PVC which is contaminated with other plastics is 
very difficult to recycle, as on heating, the material decomposes 
before it melts. It is possible to dissolve PVC in organic 
solvents, but when other plastics are present these may also 
dissolve with undesirable effects. With much scrap PVC the only 
method of disposal is land fill. However, this can be hazardous 
if the PVC contains toxic metallic fragments, such as copper from 
PVC covered copper wire. In addition, stabilisers are frequently 
added to PVC and these may be salts of Sn, Pb, Cd, Zn, Ba, Ca, Cu 
and Na, some of which form toxic compounds when PVC is heated at 
elevated temperatures. As more and more products are recycled, various residues, fluxes 
and drosses are formed which have no commercial value and have 
difficult and expensive disposal problems. It is possible to 
devise chemical ways for treating these materials, but invariably 
the cost of the reagents and the chemicals makes the processes 
prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, many of these waste 
materials have been declared hazardous, and therefore this makes 
their disposal even more difficult. One example of a substance 
which is generated and which requires recycling is electric arc 
furnace dust, which is generated when scrap steel is melted in an 
electric arc furnace. The dust contains iron oxides and 
quantities of zinc, lead and cadmium which makes it a toxic 
material. Known methods of attempting to dispose of the electric 
arc furnace dust have proved to be unsatisfactory, in that it is 
very difficult to extract all the zinc, cadmium and lead so that 
the remaining slags, dust etc are completely safe for disposal. 
The problem of disposing such materials is likely to get 
considerably worse in the future when car bodies that have been 
galvanised are recycled.  
 German patent application number 3443722 discloses a process for 
the thermic removal of halogen compounds, particular dioxine, 
phosphine and polychlorinated bi-phenyl forming chlorine 
compounds containing wastes in a turbulant layer reactor. German patent application number 3615027 discloses a process for 
the eradication of organic halogen compounds, particularly 
chlorinated bi-phenyls, polychlorinated dioxines and 
polychlorinated furanes. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a  
 
method of treating
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of treating PVC, chlorinated rubbers or 
chlorinated polymers comprising the steps of: 


combining PVC, chlorinated rubber, or chlorinated polymer 
at an elevated temperature with at least a ferrous metal and a 

non-ferrous metal or a compound of a ferrous metal and non-ferrous 
metal, the non-ferrous metal being chosen from the group: 

zinc, lead, cadmium; 
reacting the PVC, chlorinated rubber or chlorinated polymer 
with an excess of air or oxygen with the metal or compound of the 

metal whereby the non-ferrous metals or compounds of non-ferrous 
metals are converted to volatile chlorides, the ferrous metals 

are partially converted to ferrous metal oxides, and ferrous 
oxides remain unchanged. 
A method according to claim 1 further comprising the step 
of adding a substance to the PVC, chlorinated rubber or 

chlorinated polymers and the metal or compound of a metal, which 
substance during the reaction combines with any calcium oxide or 

group II oxide which may exist in the mixture to form a stable 
compound which will not chlorinate during the reaction. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the PVC, chlorinated 
rubber, or chlorinated polymer is combined with electric arc 

furnace dust. 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the 
substance added is either silicon oxide or boron oxide. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the PVC, chlorinated 
rubber, or chlorinated polymer is burned separately in excess of 

air or oxygen, and the ferrous and non-ferrous metals or 
compounds are then contacted with the gases produced by the 

combustion of the PVC chlorinated rubber or chlorinated polymer 
in air or excess air.
