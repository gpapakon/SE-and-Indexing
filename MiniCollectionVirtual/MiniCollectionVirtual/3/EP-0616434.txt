<ABSTRACT>
Digital receiver comprising antenna means (11) for picking up signals, means (21) for converting an incoming signal to a predetermined intermediate frequency, and baseband processing means (14). This receiver further comprises analog/digital conversion means (15) with over sampling with respect to the bandwidth of the signal, receiving, as input, the intermediate-frequency signal, and decimation filtering means (9, 10) receiving, as input, the converted signal output by the said analog/digital conversion means (15) and linked, at the output, to the baseband processing means (14).
