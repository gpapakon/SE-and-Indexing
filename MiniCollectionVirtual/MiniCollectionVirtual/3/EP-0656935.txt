<ABSTRACT>
An environmentally compatible and biodegradable rinse cycle fabric conditioning composition is provided capable of providing improved softening with significant reduction and solubilization of unwanted mineral encrustations on fabrics to be softened. The composition comprises: (a) from about 1 to about 20 %, by weight, of a diesterified long chain fatty acid cationic fabric softener represented by general formula (I), wherein RCO represents the residue of a fatty acid having from about 12 to 24 carbon atoms; R2 and R3 represent independently a lower alkyl group or a hydroxyalkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; n and m are integers from 1 to 4 and X is a water-solubilizing anion; and (b) from about 1 to about 25 %, by weight, of unreacted organic or mineral acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RINSE CYCLE FABRIC SOFTENERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to fabric softening compositions which are suitable for softening in the rinse cycle of an automatic household washing machine, and which are especially adapted for use under European laundering conditions. More particularly, the present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions comprising a diesterified quaternary ammonium salt in combination with an acid and optionally a fatty alcohol, which compositions are characterized by superior environmental compatibility relative to conventional quaternary ammonium fabric softening compositions concomitant with providing improved calcium salt solubilization and reduction of encrustation on treated fabrics.Esterified quaternary ammonium salts are known in the art as fabric softeners, and are generally recommended for use in combination with fatty alcohols or linear alkyoxylated alcohols. U.S. Patent 4,844,823 to Jacques et al describes a diesterified long chain fatty acid di lower-alkyl quaternary ammonium salt as a preferred class of cationic fabric softeners for use in conjunction with a fatty alcohol having from 10 to 24 carbon atoms. In EP-A-309,052 there is disclosed a liquid softening composition containing a monoester or diester quaternary ammonium compound in combination with an alkyoxylated alcohol which is said to reduce the ester hydrolysis rate of the quaternized softening compound, thereby improving its chemical stability. The combination of organic acid with cationic fabric softener is also disclosed in the prior art. U.S. Patent 3,904,359 and 3,954,630 to Ramachandran disclose a fabric treating composition comprising a complexing acid such as citric or maleic acid in combination with a quaternary ammonium softening compound. The function of the acid, as stated in the patent, is to prevent yellowing of fabrics due to build-up of cationic softener and to provide a complexing site for metal ions contained in soils. U.S. Patent 4,162,984 describes a mixture of a quaternary ammonium salt and an aromatic carboxylic acid such as benzoic acid to provide an emulsion having significantly increased viscosity. U.S. Patent 4,426,299 discloses a fabric softening composition comprising ≥ defined quaternary ammonium compound and a viscosity control agent which may be a C9-C24 fatty acid. In U.S. Patent 4,559,151 there is disclosed the combination of quaternary ammonium salts with a lactic acid salt for the purpose of imparting improved antistatic properties. U.S. Patent
