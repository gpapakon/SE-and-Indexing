<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to virtual image display systems, and 
more particularly, to a reconfigurable display management system employing a virtual 
image head-up display that is capable of processing and displaying information from a 
variety of sources. Conventional sensor, imaging, and communication data display systems are 
usually hard-wired to display a specific function or set of functions, and are incapable 
of reconfiguration by an operator to display different sensor images and/or communications 
data. Conventional systems typically display images outside of an operator's 
visual field of focus, such as on an automobile dashboard or console mounted display, 
for example. There is also a need to improve operator and equipment safety and efficiency by 
reducing the need to divert the operator's attention away from primary system functions, 
such as vehicle operation, in order to view information displays that are outside 
the operator's visual field and that represent secondary system functions. Additional 
personnel are sometimes required to manage the secondary system functions in order to 
prevent accidents and improve system efficiency when conventional display technology 
is employed. Conventional sensor and communications displays tend to clutter the 
operator's visual field of view and distract the operator from performing critical system 
functions. The distraction duration, it's effect on operator performance, and it's effect 
on operator safety, depends upon the complexity, number, and location of secondary 
function displays.  Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a reconfigurable 
display management system employing a virtual image head-up display that is 
capable of processing and displaying information from a variety of sources. In order to achieve the above and other objectives, the present invention provides 
for a reconfigurable visual image display management system employing a head-up 
display that integrates and processes and displays information from a variety of 
sources. The virtual image display management system comprises a display projector 
and an optical combiner disposed in the vehicle that is adapted to display an image 
projected by the display projector at a predetermined location within the field of view of 
an operator of the vehicle. At least one sensor or data and communication system is 
disposed in the vehicle that is adapted to provide data that is to be displayed to the 
operator. A display electronics unit is
