<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic viewer according to
the preamble of claim 1. The electronic viewer is
used for imaging a subject such as a negative or positive
film or a document using a solid state electronic imaging
device, applying a video signal obtained by the imaging to a
display device and displaying an image of the subject on the
display device to see or check the subject, and a film
carrier used for holding, when a film is seen using the
electronic viewer, the film.In order to confirm, check or select an image appearing
on a negative film, the negative film is difficult to be
understood even if it is seen with the naked eye.
Therefore, an electronic viewer (an electronic still camera
or a video camera) for imaging the negative film by a solid
state electronic imaging device, converting a video signal
obtained by the imaging into a video signal representing a
positive image by a negative/positive inversion circuit and 
outputting the same has been known. The video signal
outputted from the electronic viewer is applied to a display
device, thereby to make it possible to see a negative image
on the negative film as a positive image and in an enlarged
manner.When the negative film is seen using such an electronic
viewer, the negative film is accommodated in a film carrier.
When the negative film is accommodated in the film carrier,
the film may be damaged or made dirty.Since the film is generally accommodated in a sheath (a
transparent or translucent film cover), it is preferable
that an image of the film can be seen using an electronic
viewer in a state where the film is accommodated in the
sheath from the point of view of protection of the film.The prior art document US-A-4.458.270 shows a film converter for converting
negative and positive films to video signals.An object of the present invention is to provide an
electronic viewer capable of seeing a film even in a state
where the film is accommodated in a film carrier or in a
state where it is accommodated in a sheath.This object is solved with an electronic viewer according to claim 1.With the inventive electronic viewer it is advantageously
possible to image not only a film but also a subject such as
a sheet or a document. An electronic viewer is the concept including a part or
all of a construction of an electronic camera (including an
electronic still camera, a video camera, and a still video
camera), an image processing apparatus, and an electronic
projector for imaging a document or the like to display the
same on a
