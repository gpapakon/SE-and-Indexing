<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating mixer has a housing for electric switching and regulating members and an electric motor, a motor-drivable tray-shaped bearing surface for containers which receive the materials to be vibrated and mixed, a hood which encloses the housing and the bearing surface together with the container, as well as a cold and/or warm air blower which opens inside the hood. In order to reduce the weight of the hood and to allow the unimpeded observation of the vibrated materials, the housing (1) for the electric motor and the housing (6) for the blower are arranged immediately next to each other in a fixed or detachable manner, and both housings (1, 6) are simultaneously covered by a single hood (10) which may be freely set on both housings (1, 6).

Vibrating and mixing apparatus, having a housing 
(1) for the accommodation of electrical switching and 

regulating elements and an electric motor, a plate-like 
stop face (5), which is drivable by the electric motor, 

for containers (9), which accommodate the material to be 
vibrated and mixed, a cover which engages over the 

housing and the stop face provided with the containers, 
and a fan, which discharges into 
the interior of the 
cover, for cold and/or hot air, characterised in that 

the housing (1), which accommodates the electric motor, 
and the fan housing (6) are disposed adjacent each other 

so as to be directly fixed or detachably fixed, and in 
that the two housings (1, 6) are overlapped jointly at 

the same time by a single cover (10), which is freely 
mountable on the two housings (1, 6). 
Vibrating and mixing apparatus according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the housing (1) and the 

fan housing (6) have upper sides which extend in a 
common plane, in that the upper sides of both housings 

(1, 6) are provided with a plate-like support (13) 
formed from a flexible material, more especially rubber, 

and in that the cover (10) is mountable on the support 
(13) in at least an approximately tight manner. 
Vibrating and mixing apparatus according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the cover (10) is formed 

by at least two cover portions (10', 10''), which are 
placeable above or adjacent one another. 
Vibrating and mixing apparatus according to 
claim 3, characterised in that the cover (10) is formed  

 
by two cover portions (10', 10'') separated in the 

region of a transverse plane (11), one of said portions 
(10'') having a circumferential groove (12) or notch in 

the edge region, which defines the parting plane, and in 
that, for the guidance and support of both cover 

portions (10', 10'') on each other, the other cover 
portion (10') engages in the groove or notch with its 

edge region, which defines the parting plane. 
Vibrating and mixing apparatus according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the fan housing (6) 

includes an upwardly orientated outlet duct (7) for the 
fan air, which duct extends inclinedly over the stop 

face (5), and the outlet duct (7) is divided into 
portions for supply air (20) and exhaust air (19) of the 

fan. 
Vibrating and mixing apparatus according to 
claim 5, characterised in that guide ribs for the fan 

air are provided in the outlet duct (7) in a fixed or 
adjustably fixed manner. 
Vibrating and mixing apparatus according to 
claim 5, characterised in that the fan is configured as 

an air-circulating fan and/or as an air-supplying fan.
