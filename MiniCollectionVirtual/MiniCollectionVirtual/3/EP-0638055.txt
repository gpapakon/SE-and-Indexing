 CRYSTALLIZATION OF OPTICAL ISOMERS OF LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTSSCOPE OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain amine salts of leukotriene antagonists and the use of an amine to form these salts as a means for crystallizing selectively optical isomers of the leukotriene antagonists recited herein.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION "Slow Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis" (SRS-A) has been shown to be a highly potent bronchoconstricting substance which is released primarily from mast cells and basophils on antigenic challenge. SRS-A has been proposed as a primary mediator in human asthma. SRS-A, in addition to its pronounced effects on lung tissue, also produces permeability changes in skin and may be involved in acute cutaneous allergic reactions. Further, SRS-A has been shown to effect depression of ventricular contraction and potentiation of the cardiovascular effects of histamine.Antagonists to SRS substances have been developed in an attempt to provide relief from the disease conditions giving rise to or resulting from these compounds. A number of the compounds developed are normally prepared as a racemic mixture, though activity lies primarily or completely in just one of the optical isomers. Resolving these mixtures is a useful, if not necessary step, in preparing a useful formulation for treating these diseases. It has now been found that for certain compounds, the ones set out below, this can be accomplished most readily and inexpensively by means of (S)-a- methylbenzenemethanamine. This amine is uniquely suited to resolving certain enantiomers of the compounds given below so that the most active isomer can be obtained for use in treating SRS-related diseases.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compounds of this invention are (S)-a-methyl-benzenemethanamine salts of formula IFormula Iwhere:A is 1 and X is 1 or 2; 

 Rl is Cg to C13 alkyl, Cη to C12 alkoxy, C7 to C12 alkylthio, Cχo to C12 l-alkym IO-undecynyloxy, 11-dodecynyl, phenyl-C4 to C10 alkyl, phenyl-C3 to C9 alkoxy, phenyltbio-C3 to C9 alkyl with the phenyl optionally mono substituted with bromo, chloπ , trifluoromethyl, C\ to C4 alkoxy, methylthio or trifluoromethylthio, furyl-C4 to C o alkyl, trifluoromethyl-C7 to C12 alkyl or cyclohexyl-C4 to C10 alkyl; q is 0, 1 or 2, with the proviso that Ri is not alkylthio or phenylthioalkyl when q is 1 or 2;Y is (CH2)mCOR3 or (CH2)m-tetrazol-5-yl; R3 is O~> amino, or Ci to CO alkoxy, mis O, 1, or 2;Ris (CH2)nCOR6; n is 0 to 6;Rg is O", amino, or Ci to C6-alkoxy; with the proviso that at least
