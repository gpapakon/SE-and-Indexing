<ABSTRACT>
The invention takes as its departure point a roller blind with a roller-blind casing (2) which comprises at least two sheet-metal parts (7, 15) which extend over its longitudinal direction and are connected to one another in an articulated manner on their abutting longitudinal-side edges, it being possible for one of the sheet-metal parts (15), which covers the roller-blind roll (4') towards the outside, to be removed from said articulated connection. In order to lower the production and storage costs of such a roller-blind casing with articulated connection and, at the same time, to ensure a greater degree of stability of the articulated connection, it is provided that, as an articulated connection, use is made of a connecting profile (6) which exhibits a fixed securing means on one, first sheet-metal part (7), which is to be fitted on the masonrywork, the longitudinal-side edge (7') which belongs to said sheet-metal part (7) and is plugged into the connecting profile being of a flat design, and it being possible to form said first sheet-metal part cross-sectionally by bending-off, and that the connecting profile further has an undercut for the articulated connection to the other, second sheet-metal part (15), which can be introduced into the undercut or removed therefrom, the longitudinal-side edge of said sheet-metal part (15) being of a form which fits into the undercut with some degree of play.
