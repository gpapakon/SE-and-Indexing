<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new tricyclic non-peptide
vasopressin antagonists which are useful in
treating conditions where decreased vasopressin levels
are desired, such as in congestive heart failure, in
disease conditions with excess renal water reabsorption
and conditions with increased vascular resistance and
coronary vasoconstriction.Vasopressin is released from the posterior
pituitary either in response to increased plasma
osmolarity detected by brain osmoreceptors or decreased
blood volume and blood pressure sensed by low-pressure
volume receptors and arterial baroreceptors. The hormone
exerts its actions through two well defined receptor
subtypes: vascular V1 and renal epithelial V2
receptors. Vasopressin-induced antidiuresis, mediated
by renal epithelial V2 receptors, helps to maintain
normal plasma osmolarity, blood volume and blood pressure.Vasopressin is involved in some cases of
congestive heart failure where peripheral resistance is
increased. V1 antagonists may decrease systemic
vascular resistance, increase cardiac output and prevent
vasopressin induced coronary vasoconstriction.
Thus, in conditions with vasopressin induced increases
in total peripheral resistance and altered local blood
flow, V1-antagonists may be therapeutic agents. The blockade of V2 receptors may be useful in
treating diseases characterized by excess renal reabsorption
of free water. Antidiuresis is regulated by
the hypothalamic release of vasopressin ( antidiuretic
hormone) which binds to specific receptors on renal
collecting tubule cells. This binding stimulates
adenylyl cyclase and promotes the cAMP-mediated incorporation
of water pores into the luminal surface of
these cells. V2 antagonists may correct the fluid retention
in congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis,
nephrotic syndrome, central nervous injuries, lung disease
and hyponatremia.Elevated vasopressin levels occur in congestive
heart failure which is more common in older
patients with chronic heart failure. In patients with
hyponatremic congestive heart failure and elevated
vasopressin levels, a V2 antagonist may be beneficial
in promoting free water excretion by antagonizing the
action of antiduretic hormone. On the basis of the
biochemical and pharmacological effects of the hormones
antagonists of vasopressin are expected to be therapeutically
useful in the treatment and/or prevention of
hypertension, cardiac insufficiency, coronary vasospasm,
cardiac ischemia, renal vasospasm, liver
cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome,
brain
