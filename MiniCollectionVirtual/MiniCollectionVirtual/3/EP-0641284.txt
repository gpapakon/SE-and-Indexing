<ABSTRACT>
A chambered doctor blade device intended for a printing unit and adapted to coat a rotatable cylinder (2) with ink, comprises an elongate frame (8) which is arranged parallel to and outside the cylinder (2) and on which are mounted two parallel, elongate and spaced-apart doctor blades (9, 10) to be resiliently and scrapingly applied against the cylinder (2) in operative position. An elongate chamber (11) holding ink (12) is defined by the doctor blades (9, 10), the surface of the frame (8) facing the cylinder (2), and the circumferential surface of the cylinder (2). To achieve good flexural and torsional rigidity, the frame (8) comprises at least two elongate interconnected metal sections (13, 14) which are made of bent thin sheet-metal, preferably of stainless steel, and by means of which the elongate portion of the frame (8) located between the mounting places for the doctor blades (9, 10) forms an elongate stiffening or reinforcing portion. Such a frame (8) ensures, in operation, a set constant distance between the frame (8) and the cylinder (2) and, consequently, constant application of the doctor blades (9, 10) against the cylinder (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chambered doctor blade 
device, in the following also referred to as chambered 
doctor blade, for a printing unit. More precisely, the 
invention concerns a chambered doctor blade of the type 
defined in the preamble to appended claim 1. In addition, 
the invention relates to a printing unit equipped with 
such a chambered doctor blade. Chambered doctor blades are extensively used in 
rotary-printing units, especially flexo-printing units, 
for applying ink, lacquer, adhesive or the like to a 
rotatable cylinder included in the printing unit. In a 
flexo-printing unit, the chambered doctor blade serves 
to ink the screen roller, i.e. fill the cells or recesses 
of the roller with printing ink. The inking of the screen 
roller is essential for the printing result. It is of special 
importance that the screen roller is uniformly inked, 
which means that the distance between the roller and the 
doctor blades have to be accurately set. As a result, the 
chambered doctor blade, usually clamped in the machine 
frame of the printing unit, has to exhibit good flexural 
and torsional rigidity. Prior-art chambered doctor blades therefore comprise 
a sturdy frame, which usually is solid and made in one 
piece and on which the doctor blades are mounted. EP-A-0 
350 839 and WO-A-89/07047, for instance, teach chambered 
doctor blades of this type. Conventionally, such doctor blade frames are made 
of solid cast iron or aluminium, or compression-moulded 
blanks of iron or aluminium provided with stiffening 
springs to reduce their weight. However, these known constructions 
suffer from some serious drawbacks. First, the 
chambered doctor blade becomes very heavy and unwieldy and 
is thus difficult to dismount from the printing unit, e.g.  
 
when to be cleaned or replaced. It usually takes two 
people to dismount a cast-iron chambered doctor blade. 
Second, one casting mould is needed for each length of 
chambered doctor blade. Third, the cast-iron structure 
naturally is liable to corrosion, which constitutes a 
serious inconvenience, since the printing ink to be circulated 
in the chamber often contains corrosive components. The market also provides doctor blade frames consisting 
of extruded aluminum sections in one piece, but these 
do not offer any satisfactory solution to the above problems. 
If to withstand the contemplated strains and to 
obtain sufficient flexural and torsional rigidity, the 
aluminium sections have to be comparatively thick, and the 
chambered doctor blade will

<CLAIMS>
A chambered doctor blade device for printing 
units, which is adapted to apply ink (12), lacquer, adhesive 

or the like to a rotatable cylinder (2) in the printing 
unit, especially a screen roller, and which comprises 

an elongate frame (8) which is arranged parallel to and 
outside the cylinder (2) and on which are mounted two 

parallel, elongate and spaced-apart doctor blades (9, 10) 
also disposed parallel to the cylinder (2) and arranged, 

in operative position, to be resiliently and wipingly 
applied against the cylinder (2), the doctor blades (9, 

10), when in said operative position, defining, together 
with the surface of the frame (8) facing the cylinder (2) 

and the circumferential surface of the cylinder (2), an 
elongate chamber (11) holding the ink (12) or the like to 

be applied to the rotating cylinder (2), 
characterised
 
in that the frame (8) comprises at least 

two elongate, interconnected metal sections (13, 14) by 
means of which the elongate portion of the frame (8) 

located between the mounting places for the doctor blades 
(9, 10) forms an elongate stiffening or reinforcing portion, 

such that the frame (8) constitutes a flexurally and 
torsionally rigid unit which in operation ensures a set 

constant distance between the frame (8) and the cylinder 
(2) and, consequently, constant application of the doctor 

blades (9, 10) against the circumferential surface of the 
cylinder (2). 
A device as set forth in claim 1, in which the 
metal sections (13, 14) together form a closed hollow
