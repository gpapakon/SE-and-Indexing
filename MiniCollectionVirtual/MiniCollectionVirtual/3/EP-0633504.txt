<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making a lithographic 
printing plate comprising the steps of: 


image-wise exposing an imaging element comprising on a support a 
silver halide emulsion layer and a layer containing physical 

development nuclei and 
developing a thus obtained image-wise exposed imaging element 
using an alkaline processing liquid in the presence of a meso-ionic 

compound and a developing agent; 
 
characterized in that said imaging element comprises silver halide 

expressed as AgNO₃ in an amount of 1.3g/m² or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making a 
lithographic printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion 
transfer process. The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in 
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion 
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London 
and New York, (1972). In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values 
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic 
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the 
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive 
ink-repellant background. For example, typical lithographic printing 
plates are disclosed e.g. EP-A-423399 and EP-A-410500. The DTR-image can be formed in the image-receiving layer of a 
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to 
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called 
two-sheet DTR element) or in the image-receiving layer of a 
so-called single-support-element, also called mono-sheet element, 
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion 
layer integral with an image-receiving layer in waterpermeable 
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which is 
preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the DTR 
method. As for other printing plates it is required that the printing 
plates obtained according to the DTR-process have a high printing  
 
endurance, good ink acceptance in the printing areas and no ink 
acceptance in the non-printing areas (no staining). It is 
furthermore desirable that the number of copies that have to be 
disposed of because of ink acceptance in the non-printing areas (so 
called toning) during start-up of the printing process is limited. 
With respect to these requirements the state of the transferred 
silver i.e. the silver formed in the image-receiving layer plays a 
very important role. Parameters that are known
