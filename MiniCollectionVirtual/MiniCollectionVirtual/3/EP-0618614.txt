<ABSTRACT>
A heat-resistant adhesive is provided for use in an adhesive 
member for the fabrication of a semiconductor package by bonding 

a semiconductor chip to a lead frame with the adhesive member 
and sealing at least the semiconductor chip and a bonded part 

between the semiconductor chip and the lead frame with a 
sealant. The adhesive has a coming-out length of not more than 2 

mm and a water absorption rate of not more than 3 wt.%. 
Preferably, the adhesive has a glass trans
ition point of at least 
200°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat-resistant adhesive
especially suitable for the bonding of a semiconductor chip to a
lead frame and an adhesive member using the adhesive.More particularly, this invention relates to a heat-resistant
adhesive suitable for use in a semiconductor package, especially a
package of LOC (lead on chip) structure, which is capable of
preventing or minimizing occurrence of cracks when solder is
subjected to reflow in conditions moisture is absorbed.The semiconductor package is fabricated by connecting a
lead frame to a semiconductor chip using an adhesive or
resonance solder and electrically connecting electrodes of the
chip to the lead frame, followed by sealing the entire structure
into a molded form as illustrated in Figs. 1 thru 3.In general, a conventional package has a structure as shown
in Fig. 3 where the chip is mounted on a tab (die pad) of the lead
frame. The connection between the lead frame and the chip is
made by Au-Si resonance solder or a thermosetting epoxy
adhesive (a die bonding agent). However, as an integration degree in the package has
become higher and a size of a chip to be mounted therein has
become larger, the percentage of the volume occupied by the chip
has become higher to such an extent that the chip cannot
completely be encased in the structure as shown in Fig. 3 where
the chip is mounted on the tab of the lead frame. To solve this
problem, such a package having no tab as shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2
has been proposed, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,140,404,
Japanese Patent Application Publications (KOKAI) 61-218139
and61-241959, U.S. Patent 4,862,246, and Japanese Patent
Application Publications (KOKAI) 2-36542 and and 4-318962. The
package structures of Figs. 1 and 2 are called LOC (lead on chip)
and COL (chip on lead), respectively. In these packages, the
connection between the lead frame and the chip is made by a
thermosetting adheseive or a heat-resistant hot melt.With the structures as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it is a trend
that the package size is becoming smaller and thinner and the
percentage of the occupation by the chip is becoming higher, the
thickness of the sealing material is becomming thinner
accordingly. Therefore, moisture absorbed by the adhesive or the
sealing material used would more often cause cracks in the
package when it evaporates or expands.To solve this problem, some attempts to improve the
sealing materials and/or the adhesives employable for the
pacakage have been proposed. For example, with respect to the
sealing materials,

A fabrication process of a semiconductor package,
comprising the steps of:


(1) bonding a semiconductor chip to a lead frame with an
adhesive member; and
(2) molding a molding compound so that the molding compound
covers at least said semiconductor chip and a bonded part

between the semiconductor chip and said lead frame, wherein:
said adhesive member comprises at least one adhesive; and said

adhesive is a heat-resistant adhesive having a coming-out length
of not more than 2 mm and a water absorption rate of not more

than 3 weight %,

wherein the term "coming-out length" defines the length of a
came-out peripheral portion of a 19 x 50 mm wide adhesive film

of 25 µm in thickness as measured at a central part in the
direction of the longer surface of the adhesive film when the

adhesive film is pressed at 350 °C under 3 MPa for one minute.

said adhesive member consists of a composite adhesive sheet

comprising a heat-resistant film and a coating layer of a heat
resistant adhesive applied on each major surface of the heat

resistant film.
