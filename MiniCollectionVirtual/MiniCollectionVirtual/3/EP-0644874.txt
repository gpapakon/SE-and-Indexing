A copolymerizable oxime ether of the formula 

 
where A is a divalent link, R¹ may be hydrogen or C₁-C₄-alkyl 

and R² and R³ independently of one another are each 
C₁-C₁₀-alkyl, C₁-C₁₀-alkoxy, C₅-C₁₀-cycloalkyl or C₅-C₁₀-aryl, 

each of which may furthermore contain 1-3 nonadjacent 
nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms as hetero atoms in the 

carbon chain or in the carbon ring and may be substituted 
by from one to three C₁-C₄-alkyl or C₁-C₄-alkoxy groups, R² 

or R³ may be hydrogen or R² and R³ together form a bridge 
of 3 to 14 carbon atoms, where some of the carbon atoms 

may also be part of an aromatic ring. 
A process for the preparation of a copolymerizable 
oxime ether as claimed in claim 1, wherein an oxime 

ether alcohol of the formula 

 
is reacted with an acryloyl chloride of the formula 


  
 

or an acrylic anhydride of the formula 

 
in the presence of a base. 
A copolymer containing from 0.01 to 30% by weight 
of an oxime ether as claimed in claim 1. 
A copolymer as claimed in claim 3, containing 

a)
from 0.01 to 30% by weight of an oxime ether of the 
formula I, 
b)
from 30 to 99.99% by weight of at least one C₁-C₂₀-alkyl 
(meth)acrylate, one vinyl ester of carboxylic 

acid of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, one vinyl aromatic of 
up to 20 carbon atoms, one ethylenically unsaturated 

nitrile of 3-6 carbon atoms, one vinyl halide or one 
nonaromatic hydrocarbon having 4 to 8 carbon atoms 

and at least 2 conjugated double bonds, 
c)
from 0 to 30% by weight of at least one comonomer 
having at least one keto or aldehyde group and 
d)
from 0 to 50% by weight of at least one further 
monomer, 
 
the copolymer having a glass transition temperature of 

from -60 to +140°C. 
Use of a copolymer as claimed in claim 3 or 4 as 
a coating material. 
Use of a copolymer as claimed in claim 3 or 4 as 
an adhesive.
