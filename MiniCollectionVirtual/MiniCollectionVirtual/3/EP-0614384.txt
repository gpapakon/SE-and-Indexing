<ABSTRACT>
A trocar (10) having a cannula (22) and housing (28) which define an access channel, is configured to receive a surgical instrument (26). A flexible valve (36) disposed in the channel includes first portions (37) which define an orifice (38) through the valve (36) and second portions (39) which are disposed outwardly of the first portions. The second portions (39) are provided with a greater flexibility so that when the instrument (26) is inserted off axis, the second portions (39) of the valve (38) will deform before the first portions (39) causing the orifice (38) to move without substantial deformation, to the off axis location. Alternatively, levers (54) engaging the first portions (37) of the valve (35) can be pivotally mounted on a floating ring (180) to move the substantially undeformed orifice (38) to the off axis location. An associated method includes the steps of deforming the second portions (30) of the valve (36) without substantially deforming the first portions (37) of the valve (36) to move the orifice (38) into axial alignment with the instrument (26). A mechanism (81) is provided for protecting the valve (36) from instruments having pointed distal tips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to access devices for
example trocars.Laparoscopic surgery is conducted through trocars which
extend across the abdominal wall and provide channels through
which instruments such as scopes, retractors and staplers can
be inserted to perform surgery in the abdominal cavity. As
part of this procedure, the abdomen is inflated with an
insufflation gas to maintain the abdomen in a distended state.
Valves are typically provided in the trocars to form seals
around the instruments in order to prevent leakage of this
insufflation gas. A variable diameter septum valve is of
particular advantage for this purpose as it is able to conform
to any size of instrument, regardless of its diameter, without
increasing the friction or drag on the instrument. A variable
diameter septum valve of this nature is disclosed and claimed
by applicant in the parent application Serial No. 07/732,144,
filed on July 18, 1992 and entitled Lever Actuated Septum Seal.
US Patent No. 4,842,591 describes a one-way septum valve
in a connector device which prevents the backward flow of blood
or bodily fluids. A plug is provided which can be displaced by
an injection device to push open the valve just prior to the
injection device passing through the septum.US Patent No. 4,960,412 discloses a catheter introducer
valve assembly in which a septum valve and a flap valve are
serially arranged along the path over which the catheter is
introduced.US Patent No. 4,758,225 discloses a device for use in the
sampling or infusion of liquids. The device has a chamber in
communication with a cannula and at least one valve to couple
the chamber to a source or drain. Venting means are provided
to vent air from the chamber while
preventing the escape of liquid. US Patent No. 4,240,411 provides a device for sealing an
endoscope channel having a septum valve and flap valve serially
arranged along the path for an endoscopic instrument.Variable diameter seals have a high degree of compliance
which is of particular advantage in accommodating different
sizes of instruments. However, this compliance can present a
problem if a particular instrument is bifurcated or is inserted
off center. Under these circumstances, the sharp point of the
instrument can localize forces along the side of the valve
providing undesirable cupping and perhaps tearing of the seal.
This can occur with any septum seal, although the highly
compliant variable diameter seals appear to be most susceptible
to damage.The off-axis insertion of an instrument can also be a

An access device having an axis extending
between a proximal end and a distal end, and arranged to

receive an instrument (26) having a pointed distal tip,
the device comprising:


a housing (28) having walls defining a channel
through the device;
a septum valve (36) disposed in the housing to
extend across the channel and to form a seal around the

instrument (26) when the instrument (26) is inserted into
the device along the channel;
inner portions (37) of the valve defining an
orifice (38) to receive the instrument (26); and
outer portions (39) of the valve extending
radially outwardly of the inner portions, characterised by

displacement means located between the proximal end and
the valve (36) and lying in the path of said instrument,

said displacement means (54) engaging said valve (36) and
responding to any radial deviation of the axis of said

instrument (26) with respect to the longitudinal axis of
the device to cause a corresponding radial displacement of

the axis of said orifice (38).
A device according to Claim 1, wherein the
displacement means (54) engages said outer portions (39)

of the valve (36) said outer portions (39) having
characteristics for displacing the orifice (38) without

substantial deformation of the orifice (38).
A device according to Claim 1 or to Claim 2,
characterised in that said displacement means (54)

comprises: a lever mechanism disposed proximally of the
valve, the lever mechanism (54) being floatingly supported

in the channel of the housing (28); whereby

insertion of the instrument (26) through the
lever mechanism (54) substantially aligns the axis of the

lever mechanism (54) and the axis of the orifice (38) with 
the axis of the instrument (26).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
