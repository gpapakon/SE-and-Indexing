<ABSTRACT>
An electric vacuum cleaner having a suction nozzle 
comprising a dust inlet (7) formed in a bottom surface (3a) of a 

nozzle body (1) and a rotary brush (10) rotatably mounted therein 
along said dust inlet, wherein said electric vacuum cleaner 

having either or both of configurations that said nozzle 
body has a flexible member (30) mounted to a front wall (1a) thereof 

to rotate back and forth corresponding to the backward and 
forward movement of said nozzle body so that the flexible 

member comes in contact with a floor to cover a lower 

portion of said front wall, and that said nozzle body has 
a sliding piece slidably mounted on at least one of side 

walls thereof to open and close the side face corresponding 
to the backward and forward movement of said nozzle body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric vacuum
cleaner, more particularly to a suction nozzle for sucking
dusts/dirts to collect them into a vacuum cleaner main body
as set out in the first part of claim 1; such a vacuum cleaner
is disclosed in JP-A-38609.Conventionally, as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication Hei 5 No. 38609, a suction nozzle in use for an
electric vacuum cleaner has a nozzle body 1 comprising an
upper casing 2, lower casing 3 and a lid 4, a driving pipe
5 disposed at a rear portion of the nozzle body so as to be
free to rotate and move up and down, and a suction pipe 6
connected to an end of the driving pipe 5 so as to be free
to rotate and move left and right as shown in Fig. 1.The lower casing 3 has a bottom surface for acting as
a sled for a carpet. The lower casing 3 has a dust inlet
7 formed in a rectangle with more width than depth and is
provided with front and rear wheels 8 and 9. The front and
rear wheels 8 and 9 make a predetermined space between the
lower casing 3 and the floor. The nozzle body 1 has a brush chamber 11 having a
rotary brush 10 rotatably disposed therein through a
supporting shaft, and a communicating path 12 connecting the
brush chamber 11 with the driving pipe 5. A dust suction
path 13 is formed from the dust inlet 7 to the suction pipe
6. A drive motor 14 is disposed outside of the dust suction
path 13 to rotate the rotary brush 10 through the belt 15.
A bumper 16 for absorbing an impact against an obstacle is
disposed between the upper casing 2 and the lower casing 3.The rotary brush 10 is made from foaming resin and
provided with a cleaning member 10a formed in a helical
projection projected from the surface thereof. The rotary
brush 10 is removable by taking the lid 4 off. The cleaning
member 10a effectively scrapes dusts from a floor such as
a carpet and the like by the rotation of the rotary brush
10 to introduce the dusts from the dust inlet 7 to the
communicating path 12 by the suction force produced by an
electric blower (not shown) of the cleaner main body to then
collect the dusts into the cleaner main body through the
suction pipe 6.Flexible members 17 and 18 are disposed along the whole
width of the dust inlet 7 about front and rear thereof. The
flexible members 17 and 18 increase the suction force by
improving the sealing performance between the dust inlet 7
and the floor. The flexible member 17 in front of the dust 
inlet 7 is removably mounted in a groove 19 formed in a
front wall 1a of the nozzle body 1 by means such as a clip
(not

<CLAIMS>
An electric vacuum cleaner having a suction nozzle comprising a dust inlet
(7) formed in a bottom surface of a nozzle body (1) which is movable relative

to a floor, and a rotary brush (10) rotatably mounted in the nozzle body along
said dust inlet, 
characterized in that
 said nozzle body (1) has a sliding piece
(90) for contacting the floor slidably mounted on at least one of the side walls (91) of

the nozzle body to open and close a cutout (91a) corresponding to the movement
direction of said nozzle body on the floor.
An electric vacuum cleaner as claimed in claim 1, wherein said nozzle
body (1) has a flexible member (30; 50) being mounted to a front wall (1a) thereof

for contacting the floor and being pivotable corresponding to the movement
direction of the nozzle body on the floor between a first position in which the flexible

member covers a lower portion of said front wall (1a), and a second position
in which the flexible member opens a space in the lower portion of the front

wall between the flexible member and the floor.
An electric vacuum cleaner as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said sliding
piece (90) comprises a slidable base portion (90a) and a plate-shaped tip

portion (90b) mounted substantially vertically to said base portion, said base
portion being made from hard material, and said plate-shaped tip portion being

made from flexible material.
An electric vacuum cleaner as claimed in claim 2, wherein said flexible
member (30) comprises a supporting shaft (31) pivotably mounted to the front

wall (1a) of said nozzle body (1) and a sealing piece (32) formed in a plate shape
mounted to said supporting shaft, said supporting shaft being made from hard
