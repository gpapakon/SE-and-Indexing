<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a current limiting device (11), of the type placed between an electronic card (12) and power supply means (13) supplying a power supply current to at least the said electronic card. According to the invention, this device comprises:   - an active element (15) possessing a variable series resistor, receiving the said power supply current (14) and delivering, to the said electronic card (12), a controlled current (114), the value of which is inversely proportional to the value of the said variable series resistor; - control means (111) controlling the value of the said variable series resistor; - a voltage multiplier (112) making it possible to supply the said device; the said control means being such that, when the said electronic card (12) has to be electrically isolated from the said power supply means (13), the said series resistor passes from a minimal value to a maximum value in a discharge duration (Dd), the said value of the controlled current progressively reducing during the said discharge duration.

Current limiter device (11), of the type disposed between an electronic card (12)
and power supply means (13) of at least said electronic card, said power supply

means (13) supplying a power supply current, comprising:

an active component (15) having a series resistance that varies in accordance

with a control signal (115), said active component (15) receiving said power
supply current (14) and delivering to said electronic card (12) a controlled

current (114), the value of said controlled current being inversely proportional
to the value of said variable series resistance;
a passive component (16) disposed between said active component (15) and
said electronic card (12), said passive component (16) determining a

measured value of the controlled current (114);
decision means (17) comprising comparator means (18) for comparing said
measured value of the controlled current to a limit value of the controlled

current and generating a disconnection indication (116) if said comparator
means (18) detect that said measured value is greater than the said limit

value; and
control means (111) for said active component (15) such that if they receive a
disconnection indication (116) they generate a control signal (115) that causes

said series resistance of the active component (15) to change from a minimal
value to a maximal value over a discharging time period (D
d
), said controlled
current value progressively falling during said discharging time period;
characterised
 in that said decision means further comprise time-delay means (R

r
) between the time at which said
comparator means (18) detect that said current value is greater than said limit

value and the time at which the disconnection indication is generated.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that said decision means (17)
comprise start/stop means (19) adapted to receive a power-down indication

(120) in respect of said electronic card (12), said decision means (17) generating
said disconnection indication (116) when said start/stop means (19) receive said

power-down indication (120).
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that said electronic card

respectively comprising first and second electrical coupling means,

and in that said decision means (17) comprise means (110) for detecting a
change from a coupling state to a non-coupling state of said electronic card (12)

and said power supply means (13) via said first and second electrical coupling
means,
and in that said decision means (17) generate a disconnection indication (116)
when said detection means (110) detect said change from a coupling state to a

non-coupling state.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that said first electrical coupling
means comprise at least a first pin, said second electrical coupling means

comprising at least a second pin, said second pin being in contact with said first
pin when said electronic card is coupled to said power supply means, and in that

said detector means comprise first and second supplementary pins offset
respectively relative to said first and second pins. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that said control
means (111) are such that, if they receive a connection indication (117)

indicating that said electronic card (12) can be electrically connected to said
power supply means (13), said control signal (115) causes said series resistance

of the active component (15) to change from a maximal value to a minimal
value in a charging time period (D
c
), said controlled current value increasing
progressively during said charging time period.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that said
comparator means (18) also compare said measured value of the controlled

current to a limitation value, said decision means (17) generating a connection
