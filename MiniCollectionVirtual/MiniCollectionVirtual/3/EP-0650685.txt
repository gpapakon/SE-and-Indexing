<ABSTRACT>
The pan body (1) has a welded-on connection piece (3) which is equipped with a peg (5) in which there is a transverse bore (6). The handle (8) has a sleeve portion (9) in which a curved transverse wall (11) is welded in. The handle with transverse wall (11) is fitted on to the peg (5) and held in this position by means of a transverse pin (15). The original straight transverse pin is bent as a result of the concave curvature (12) of the transverse wall (11) and in the process presses the handle against the pan body (1).

Device for mounting a handle (8) on a pan
(1), with a base piece (3) intended to be permanently

fixed to the outside (2) of the pan (1), with a socket
part (9) of the handle (8), which socket part is engaged

onto the base piece (3), and with fixing means (15) fixing
the handle (8) on the base piece (3) which comprise a

bolt (5) extending towards the handle (8) and having a
transversal hole (6), characterized in that the socket

part (9) comprises a curved transversal wall (11) engaged
onto the bolt (5) by an aperture (14) in such a way that

when the handle (8) is mounted the transversal wall (11)
lies next to the transversal hole (6), and with a transversal

key (15) engaged in the transversal hole (6) and
leaning against the concave side (12) of the curved

transversal wall (11) when the handle (8) is mounted.
Device according to claim 1, characterized
in that the transversal wall (11) has a convex curvature

(13) which faces the pan (1) when the handle (8) is
mounted.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the socket part (9) has at least one

transversal aperture (10) through which the transversal
key (15) can be introduced into the interior of the

socket part (9) and through the transversal hole (6) of
the bolt (5).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the socket part (9) has two transversal

apertures (10, 16), one of which (16) serves to
lead the transversal key (15) from the inside of the

socket part (9) towards the exterior.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the socket part (9) has an elliptic 

transversal section into which the transversal wall (11)
is set, and that the curvature of the transversal wall

(11) follows the main axis of the ellipse.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the base piece (3) comprises a

transversal plate (4) oriented transversally to its bolt
(5) and which on its side facing away from the bolt (5)

exhibits a curvature mating that of the outside (2) of
the pan (1).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the transversal wall (11) is welded

inside the socket part (9).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the transversal key (15) consists

of an elastic rod acting as a spring.
Method for manufacturing the device according
to claim 1, characterized in that the transversal

key (15) is straight before the handle (8) is mounted on
the pan (1), and that it becomes progressively more

curved through its contact with the concave side (12) of
the transversal wall (11) when progressively pushed into

the transversal hole (6) of the bolt (5).
