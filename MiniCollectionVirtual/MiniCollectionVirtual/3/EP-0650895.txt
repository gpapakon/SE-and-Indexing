<ABSTRACT>
Packaging containers for beverages, for example milk or juice, as well 
as blanks for producing the packaging containers, are often manufactured 

from paper-plastic laminate which, by fold forming and sealing, is given the 
desired container configuration, normally parallelepipedic. With the aid of a 

specifically designed pattern of fold or crease lines which divide the material 
into, for example, six side panels (1) and associated primary end panels (7) 

and secondary end panels (8), respectively, prismatic, preferably hexagonal 
containers may instead be produced using substantially known methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging container formed by
folding and sealing of packaging material comprising a number of mutually
bordering side wall panels and two end regions, of which at least one
includes two primary end panels, which, by means of crease lines, are each
defined from their adjacent first side wall panel, a number of secondary end
panels which interconnect the primary end panels with other side wall
panels, and a sealing fin, the packaging container having a number of side
wall panels in excess of four bordering on said end region, a first side wall
panel bordering on a primary end panel, while at least two other side wall
panels located adjacent one another both each border on their secondary end
panel.The invention also relates to a packaging container blank for
producing said packaging container, the packaging container blanks being
divided by means of a number of crease lines into three transverse zones,
viz. a central which comprises a number of side wall panels and a
longitudinal sealing panel, two end zones located on either side of this
central zone, each one of which comprising a number of end panels, and a
transverse sealing panel, the end zone including at least one primary end
panel and secondary end panels located on either side thereof.Packaging containers for milk, juice or other beverages are produced
in consumer sizes from laminated paper-plastic material which is folded and
sealed into packaging containers of the desired shape. A particularly
common packaging container is manufactured from a flexible packaging
material web which is provided with crease lines and is progressively
reformed into a tube and provided with a longitudinal liquid-tight seal. The
tube is filled with the desired contents, whereafter at regular spaces it is
pressed flat and transversely sealed for the formation of substantially
cushion-shaped packaging containers filled with contents. These are
thereafter separated from the tube and reformed, int. al. by flat pressing and
downward folding of triangular corner flaps, into a parallelepipedic 
packaging container of known type. The above-described
production principle, together with a machine for
manufacturing the above container type is described in greater
detail in US Patent US 3.325.961 and European Patent EP 25235,
to which reference is now made.The above-disclosed packaging container has, as previously
mentioned, a characteristic parallelepipedic basic shape with
flat-pressed, substantially triangular corner flaps folded
down into

<CLAIMS>
A packaging container formed by folding and sealing of
packaging material comprising


a number of mutually bordering side wall panels (1) and two
end regions (5, 6), of which at least one includes two primary

end panels (7), which, by means of crease lines, are each
defined from their adjacent first side wall panel (la),
groups of secondary end panels (8) which interconnect
the primary end panels (7) with other side wall panels (lb),

and a sealing fin (9),
the packaging container having a number of side wall panels
(1) in excess of four bordering on said end region,
a first side wall panel (la) bordering on a primary end panel
(7), while at least two other side wall panels (lb) located

adjacent one another both each border on their groups of
secondary end panels (8),

characterized in that
said sealing fin (9), in two material layers sealed in
liquid-tight fashion to one another, connects edge regions of

both the primary end panels (7) and the groups of secondary
end panels (8) with one another over the entire flat-laid

width of the packaging container, 
at least two secondary end panels (8) of each group of
secondary end panels (8)

are divided, by means of crease lines, into a main section and
similar triangular refold

panels (10) and are placed partly beneath adjacent, undivided
secondary end panels (8), and
said secondary end panels (8) form flat-laid corner flaps (23)
which are folded down towards and sealed to the outside of

said end regions (5, 6) wherein said refold panels (10) are
folded in under said undivided secondary end panels (8).
The packaging container according to claim 1,

characterized in that

horizontal crease lines (3, 4) define each end region (5, 6),
and substantially parallel vertical crease lines (2) extending

between the end regions (5, 6), said crease lines (2, 3, 4)
together defining said side wall panels (1).
The packaging container according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

it has six quadrilateral side wall panels (1).
The packaging container according to claim 3,

characterized in that

the side wall panels (1) pairwise make angles of 120° in
relation to one another.
The packaging container according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

it has eight quadrilateral side wall panels (1).
The packaging container according to claim 5,

characterized in that

the side wall panels (1) pairwise make angles of 135° in
relation to one another. 
The packaging container according to any one or more of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that the side wall panels (1) display at
least one longitudinal seal.
The packaging container according to any one or more of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

one end region (5, 6) is provided with a top (18) covering
both primary end panels (7) and corner flaps (23).
The packaging container according to any one or more of the
preceding claims,

characterized in that

one end region (5, 6) displays an opening arrangement (19-22).
The packaging container according to claim 9,

characterized in that

the opening arrangement (19-22) is located in a space of the
one primary end panel (7) not covered by the downwardly folded

corner flaps (23).
A packaging container blank which, by means of a number of
crease lines (3, 4) is divided into three transverse zones,

viz. a central (11) which comprises a number of quadrilateral
side wall panels (1), and a longitudinal sealing panel (14),

two end zones (12, 13) located on either side of this central
zone (11), each one of which end zones (12, 13) including a

number of end panels (7, 8), and a transverse marginal sealing panel
(16, 17),

each end zone (12, 13) including at least one primary end
panel (7) and a group of secondary end panels (8) disposed on

either side thereof,

characterized in that
 
said primary end panel (7) forms an extension of a first side

wall panel (la), said group of secondary end panels (8)
constituts a continuation of at least two second side wall

panels (lb) located in the central zone (11),

at least two of said secondary end panels (8) of each group of
secondary end panels (8) are divided, by means of crease lines,

into a main section and similar
triangular refold panels (10) which can be folded under

adjacent, undivided secondary end panels (8), said transverse sealing
panels (16, 17) are suitable for forming a sealing fin over the

entire flat-laid width of the packaging container and
the primary end panels (7) are trapezoidal or hexagonal.
