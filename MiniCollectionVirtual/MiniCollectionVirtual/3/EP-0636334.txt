Machine for distributing ships with prepayment, consisting 
of an enclosure (1, 2, 3) provided with an access flap (9) to 

a zone (16) for delivering a receptacle (10) and in which are 
arranged: 


a hopper (18) for storing, at a suitable temperature, pre-cooked 
frozen chips, provided with a device (20, 21) for 

discharging chips from the hopper; 
a device (22) for weighing given portions of chips; 
means (25, 52 to 54) for transferring the quantity weighed 
by the said weighing device (22) in the direction of a cooking 

unit (27); 
a chute (13) conveying the cooked chips from the said 
cooking unit (27) to the said delivery zone (16); 
a device for storing receptacles (10) and distributing them 
one by one to the said delivery zone (16); 
a coin-slot system (6) triggering an operating cycle of the 
machine, and 
a programming device activated by the coin slot (6) and 
controlling, monitoring and synchronising the various steps of 

the said cycle, 
 
characterised in that 


on the one hand, the said weighing means (22) and means of 
transferring chips (F) to the said cooking unit (27) at the 

loading station consist of a tray (49) mounted so as to tilt 
under the return force of a counterweight (51) which is 

adjustable in position and by means of a retractable mounting  
 

of the base (54) of the said tray (49), controlled by a 
suitable device (25, 26, 52, 53), from a signal supplied by a 

microswitch for the end of tilting travel of the said tray, 
and 
on the other hand, the said cooking unit (27) is movable in 
translation between a first position for loading the chips, a 

second cooking position underneath a cooking station (29) 
including one or more halogen lamps (35) or similar, equipped 

with reflectors (36), and a third position of unloading the 
chips. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
device controlling the retracting pivoting of the base (54) 

consists of a finger (52) actuated by a linkage (25) and on 
the path of which there is a projection (53) integral with the 

said base (54), the latter being pivotally mounted along one 
of the sides of the tray (49) and returned to its initial 

position by a spring (55). 
Machine according to Claims 1 to 2, characterised in that 
the said movable cooking unit (27) consists of a carriage (30) 

sliding horizontally, consisting of a plate (41) carrying a 
receptacle (40) with an opening base (42), the opening of 

which is actuated when the said carriage (30) moves into the 
said chip unloading position. 
Machine according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
said base (42) is pivotally mounted in the vicinity of one of 

the sides of the receptacle (40) and rests on fixed studs (45) 
so that the sliding of the said base (42) on the said fixed 

studs (45) leads , at the said unloading station, to the 
opening of the said base (42) in the direction of the said 

chute (13) conveying the chips to the said delivery zone (16). 
Machine according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that 
the said plate (41) is subjected to vibrations by means of a  

 
suitable device (46, 47, 48) during the cooking and optionally 

the discharging of the chips. 
Machine according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
device generating the vibrations consists of an eccentric cam 

(47) driven by a motor carried by the carriage (30) and in 
contact with the said plate (41), the latter being elastically 

mounted on mobile runners (31a) of the carriage (30). 
Machine according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the cooking station (29) includes a hood (37) for 

recovering fumes, connected by a duct (38) to a device (39) 
for extracting the said fumes and discharging them to the 

outside after filtration.
