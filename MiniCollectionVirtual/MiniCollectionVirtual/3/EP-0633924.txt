<CLAIMS>
The use of a water-based composition for cleaning 
hard surfaces, this composition containing anionic 

surfactant, water-miscible organic solvent from the group 
consisting of alcohols, ether alcohols and mixtures 

thereof, alkali from the group consisting of ammonia, 
alkanolamines containing up to 9 carbon atoms and mixtures 

thereof and a carboxylic acid containing up to 6 
carbon atoms or a mixture of such carboxylic acids and 

the equivalent ratio of amine and/or ammonia to carboxylic 
acid in the composition being between 1:0.9 and 

1:0.1. 
The use claimed in claim 1, in which the cleaning 
composition additionally contains nonionic surfactant. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
carboxylic acid in the cleaning composition is selected 

from the group consisting of acetic acid, citric acid, 
lactic acid and mixtures thereof. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
cleaning composition contains ammonia together with an 

ethanolamine from the group consisting of mono-, di- and 
triethanolamine and mixtures thereof, preferably monoethanolamine. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
cleaning composition contains a mixture of lower alcohol 

containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms and glycol ether from the 
group consisting of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, 

propyleneglycol monobutyl ether and mixtures thereof as 
the water-miscible organic solvent. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
anionic surfactant in the cleaning composition is selected 

from the group consisting of alkanesulfonates, alkyl 
ether sulfates, alkylsulfates and mixtures thereof. 
The use claimed in claim 2, in which the nonionic 
surfactant in the cleaning composition is selected from  

 
the group consisting of ethoxylates of long-chain alcohols, 

alkyl polyglycosides and mixtures thereof. 
The use claimed in claim 7, in which the cleaning 
composition contains a surfactant combination of fatty 

alkyl sulfate and alkyl polyglucoside. 
The use claimed in claim 1, in which the cleaning 
composition contains the following active substanc
es: 

0.05 to 0.3 %
by weight anionic surfactant, 
0 to 0.15%
by weight nonionic surfactant, 
0.5 to 15 %
by weight water-miscible organic solvent, 
0.1 to 3 %
by weight ammonia and/or alkanolamine, 
0.05 to 3 %
by weight carboxylic acid, 
0 to 2 %
by weight other typical auxiliaries, 
 
balance to 100% by weight water. 
The use claimed in claim 1, in which the cleaning 
composition is initially prepared by diluting a concentrate 

containing the following active substances: 

0.3 to 3%
by weight anionic surfactant, 
0 to 1%
by weight nonionic surfactant, 
10 to 50%
by weight water-miscible organic solvent, 
1 to 10%
by weight ammonia and/or alkanolamine, 
1 to 10%
by weight carboxylic acid, 
0 to 10%
by weight other typical auxiliaries, and 
 
balance to 100% by weight at least 10% by weight water. 
The use claimed in any of claims 1 to 10 for cleaning 
hard surfaces, more particularly glass, in which the 

cleaning composition is applied, preferably by spraying, 
to the surface to be cleaned in quantities of 1.5 to 5 g 

per m
2
 and the surface is subsequently cleaned by wiping 
with a soft, absorbent article.
