<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber preform (1) is described comprising a 
core (12) made of a transparent material in a central region 

and a cladding (11) made of a transparent material in a 
peripheral region. The optical fiber preform (1) is 

uniformly twisted in the core (12) in one direction or around 
a central axis passing through in the vicinity of said core 

(12) in one direction, and has a length longer than a twisted 
pitch so that an optical fiber which is drawn from the 

preform has uniform twists remaining in one direction, and 
polarization dispersion which occurs in an optical signal 

propagating in the optical fiber appears around an optical 
axis in 360° direction and is cancelled out one after 

another; therefore, the entire polarization dispersion can be 
suppressed. Further, the optical fiber may be twisted in a 

step of vitrifying or pulling during optical fiber 
manufacture, which does not cause a rise in the processing 

cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber 
preform and an optical fiber and their manufacturing 
methods. Conventionally, a VAD method, an outside vapor 
deposition method, an inside vapor deposition method 
(MCVD, plasma CVD method), or a rod-in-tube method has 
been known as a method of manufacturing a silica optical 
fiber. Typical processes will be described below. In the 
VAD method, material is provided in an oxyhydrogen burner 
and fine particles of glass are synthesized in flame by 
hydrolysis reaction, and deposited at the end of a 
rotating starting rod in axial direction to make a porous 
glass preform, and the preform is dehydrated, vitrified, 
shrunk and pulled to make a cylindrical optical fiber 
preform. Next, the optical fiber preform is drawn to form 
an optical fiber which has desired refractive index 
distribution. The inside vapor deposition is a method of 
manufacturing an optical fiber by feeding material and 
oxygen into a silica tube, depositing glass thin films 
inside the tube by traversing a burner from outside of the  
 
tube and collapsing to form an optical fiber preform 
('Fibers for information transmission', Seni to Kougyo 
Vol. 4 No. 5 1985, pp. 151-160). The rod-in-tube method 
is a method of manufacturing an optical fiber by 
inserting a glass rod which will be a core into a thick 
glass tube which will be a cladding, sealing its lower 
end, heating to soften, pulling and drawing at once. In the aforementioned process of manufacturing an 
optical fiber preform, refractive index distribution is 
considered to be the concentric circular in all cross 
sections of the optical fiber obtained after fiber 
drawing. However, the cross sections of the optical 
fiber are, in fact, slightly elliptical or distorted 
circular; consequently, refractive index distribution is 
not exactly the concentric circular. Because of this, 
group velocities of two polarized waves perpendicular to 
each other in the cross section of the optical fiber have 
a difference, which leads a problem of polarization 
dispersion to be large. Therefore, when the optical 
fibers are utilized as optical fibers for undersea cables 
or trunk cables, which are required for uses of massive 
information and long distance transmission, the 
polarization dispersion effects become large. It is 
theoretically true that if the process of manufacturing 
an optical fiber is restrictively controlled, to make a 
core to be circular and to make a cladding and core to be  
 
concentric circular are possible.
