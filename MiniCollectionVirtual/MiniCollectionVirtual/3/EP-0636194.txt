<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a papermaking machine for
making a continuous paper sheet from a wet paper web, and
more particularly to a web conditioning assembly used for
removing water and conditioning a felt used in said machine,
said assembly including a suction chamber which is rotatable
for easy cleaning or disassembly.With regard to the prior art, in papermaking or
Fourdrinier machines, various means are used for removing
water from a continuous wet paper web to obtain a paper
sheet having a preselected water content, density, and other
characteristics. For example, the wet paper web is
contacted with a continuous felt and then the felt and the
paper web are passed through a press nip and/or other means
for removing water from the paper web and transferring it to
the felt. After the web and felt are separated, the felt
traverses one or more devices used for dewatering and
conditioning the felt. Devices are known in the art, such
as felt suction pipes or uhle boxes, which consist of an
elongated pipe extending across the width of the felt. The
pipe has a longitudinal, relatively narrow slot, usually
defined by a cover secured to the pipe. At least one end of
the pipe is in communication with a source of vacuum to
produce suction through the slot, thereby extracting water
from the felt. A lube shower may be mounted upstream of the
pipe slot for wetting the felt before it traverses the slot
for conditioning the felt.GB 1 285 414 describes one arrangement for extracting
liquid from a paper machine felt or web in which a manifold,
extending across the web, extracts liquid via suction
through an inlet slot. The ends of the manifold are
attached to a frame by means of clamps, which rotatably 
embrace the manifold so that when the bolts are loose, the
manifold may be rotated about its axis for position
adjustment purposes.After prolonged use, the felt may pick up foreign
materials, including small segments of the paper web. These
foreign materials are removed from the felt by the suction
pipe, and may get lodged into the slot of the pipe requiring
cleaning.Economically it is more convenient to keep the machine
line running without cleaning and reconditioning the felt
for the short time period required to clean the suction
slots. While this procedure may result in some of the paper
sheet being discarded because it does not meet certain
specifications, it is still cheaper in the long run than
stopping the line altogether because the expensive and time
consuming restarting of the machine is avoided. Various

A suction pipe assembly (10) for dewatering a felt or
paper web (44) in a papermaking machine comprising:


a frame (12);
a hollow pipe (14) comprising a fixed pipe section (18)
mounted on said frame and a rotating pipe section (16)

rotatably supported by said frame, said fixed and rotating
pipe sections having a common longitudinal axis (34) and

being disposed in an axially spaced relationship;
said pipe sections (16, 18) each having a closed end
supported by said frame and facing open ends sealed together;
pipe support means disposed in said hollow pipe (14) at
said open ends for rotatably supporting said rotating pipe

section (16);
suction means supported by said rotating pipe section
for applying suction to said felt or paper web (44);
vacuum supply means (24) for applying a vacuum to said
pipe sections (16, 18); and
whereby said rotating pipe section (16) is capable of
being selectively rotated with respect to said frame (12)

for cleaning.
The assembly (10) of claim 1, wherein said pipe support
means includes a shaft (46) disposed in said hollow pipe

(14) and supporting means mounted on said shaft for
supporting said hollow pipe on said shaft.

pipe support means includes a bearing means. 
The assembly (10) of claim 3, wherein said pipe support
means includes a sleeve (52) and a shaft (46) disposed in

said hollow pipe (14), said sleeve and shaft cooperating to
form a sleeve bearing.
The assembly (10) of claim 4, wherein said pipe support

means further includes a member extending from said sleeve
(52) or shaft (46) to one of said rotating and fixed pipe

sections (16, 18).
The assembly (10) of claim 5, wherein said pipe support
means includes vanes (48,58), which each extend radially

from said shaft (46) or sleeve (52) to one of said rotating
and fixed pipe sections (16,18).
The assembly (10) of claim 1, wherein each said pipe
section (16,18) has an elongated member extending co-axially

with said longitudinal axis (34), and said pipe support
means extend from said elongated members to inner surfaces

of said pipe sections, bearing means also being provided for
rotatably coupling said elongated members.
The assembly (10) of claim 7, wherein one of said
elongated members includes a shaft (46) disposed co-axially

with said longitudinal axis (34) in one of said rotating
(16) and fixed (18) pipe sections, and the other of said

elongated members includes a sleeve (52) disposed co-axially
with said longitudinal axis in the other of said fixed anti

rotating pipe sections, said shaft and sleeve cooperating to
form a sleeve bearing. 
The assembly (10) of claim 1, wherein said hollow pipe
(14) includes rotating means for selectively rotating said

hollow pipe.
