<ABSTRACT>
A vertical-type injection molding machine comprising 
a lower fixed mold half (1) mounted on a machine base, an 

upper movable mold half situated upwardly of said lower 
fixed mold half (2) in confronting relationship therewith, 

and a material reservoir (5) for storing a cleaning material 
and a various kinds of molding materials individually. 

The material reservoir (5) has a switching means (5a) for 
switching one kind of molding material over another. The 

injectin molding machine also comprises an injector (3) 
having a nozzle (3a), an injection cylinder (3b), and a 

molding material supply unit (3c) connected to the switching 
means (5a) via a material supply pipe (4), means (6) for 

opening and closing a tip (3a') of said nozzle (3a) during 
the switching of the molding materials, and a discharged 

material receiving device (8) reciprocatingly movable between 
a position right under the nozzle tip (3a') and a position 

right above a material discharge portion (7) on the side of 
said upper movable mold half (2) and adapted to be inverted 

by 180°.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vertical-type injection
molding machine which can realize reduction of size and
can switch materials efficiently to meet with flexible
manufacturing of various types of products in small quantities
without interruption of operation.The increase of frequency in making arrangements
to cope with flexible manufacturing of various types of
products in small quantities in recent years has a great influence
on productivity. In order to reduce time for arrangements
to switch materials, an improved vertical-type
injection molding machine is disclosed in, for example,
Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 63-23892, in which a
plurality of injection heads are supported on a turn table
turnable on a fixed base about a vertical axis, and a plurality
of sets of fixed and movable mold halves concentrically
mounted respectively on upper and lower rotary discs via
upper and lower attachment plates, the rotary discs being
turnable under the fixed base about the same vertical axis.In the known vertical-type injection molding machine,
the upper mold half of upper and lower mold halves which is
toward an injection nozzle is a fixed mold half and the
lower mold half remote from the injection nozzle is a movable 
mold half. The used injection head is shifted to the material
switching position when the material of one color is
changed to that of another color, while another injection
head for which arrangements for the following injecting
operation have been previously completed is shifted to the
injecting position. Thus the change of color of material
is performed within a short time. Since the plurality of sets
of movable and fixed mold halves can be switched from one to another,
it is possible to form different shapes of molded products
by switching necessary mold sets.However, the vertical-type injection molding machine
disclosed in the above-identified publication has a rather
complicated structure. Further, partly since the fixed
base is located centrally of the machine, and partly since
the injection heads are located above the fixed base while
the plural sets of upper and lower mold halves are located
under the fixed base, the upper mold half must be fixed and
the lower mold half must be movable, in order to reduce
upward and downward strokes of the injection nozzle to a
minimum.Further, when a slide fastener chain having a pair
of interengaged coupling element rows mounted centrally on
a pair of continuous fastener tapes along its entire length
is processed with high dimensional precision
