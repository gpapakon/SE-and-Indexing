<ABSTRACT>
A printing system (10) for a shuttle-type printer includes a 
platen (12) and a carriage (22) configured to move bidirectionally 

across the platen. An optically responsive demarcation (70) is 
provided on the platen outside of the media feed path (19). A 

printhead (40) and an optical sensor (50) are disposed on the 
carriage (22). During operation, the carriage is operable to position 

the optical sensor (50) over the platen demarcation (70), whereby the 
optical sensor generates a position signal when it detects the platen 

demarcation. A control subsystem (60) is operably coupled to the 
optical sensor (50) to determine absolute position of the carriage 

relative to the platen (12) in response to optical identification of the 
platen demarcation (70) by the optical sensor (50). Several methods 

for operating such a printing system are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shuttle-type printers and methods for
operating them.Shuttle-type printers are a class of printers having a movable
shuttle or carriage that traverses back and forth across a printing
surface. A printhead is mounted on the shuttle and synchronized
with shuttle movement to print desired images. The shuttle class of
printers includes both impact printers, such as dot matrix and
daisy-wheel printers, and non-impact printers, such as ink-jet printers.A shuttle drive mechanism maneuvers the shuttle over the
printing surface. The shuttle drive mechanism typically consists of
a motor, and a belt and pulley assembly which operably couples the
shuttle to the motor. Common motors used in such mechanisms
include a DC motor which changes speed and direction in relation
to the level and polarity of DC voltage applied thereto, and a
stepper motor which changes speed and direction in response to
intermittent pulses. The stepper motor is less effective at providing
precise position control as compared to the DC motor plus shaft
encoder; but, the stepper motor is advantageously less expensive than
the DC motor and encoder. One problem that plagues shuttle-type printers is the inherent
lack of precise positional control due to mechanical tolerances of the
shuttle drive mechanism. The motor and drive belt assembly possess
manufacturing variances that induce slight, but acceptable, errors in
the shuttle positioning process. These errors are manifest in
assembled printers and vary from printer to printer. Accordingly, it
would be advantageous to identify the inherent mechanical errors
within an assembled printer and compensate for them.JP-A-62226765 describes how to accurately set a home position of a
printer carriage by providing a reading mark on the printer platen
which is detected by a home position reading means. This invention, as specified in the claims hereinafter, overcomes the above drawbacks by
providing a low cost, automated system and associated operating
methods for determining absolute carriage position relative to the
platen. In contrast to JP-A-62226765, the present invention employs an aperture in the
platen for determining the carriage home position.According to one aspect of this invention, a printing system for
a shuttle-type printer includes a platen and a carriage mounted
adjacent to, but spaced from, the platen to permit passage of a
recording media therebetween. The media flows along a media feed
path having a width effective to cover a first portion of the platen
while

<CLAIMS>
A printing system for a shuttle-type printer, comprising:

a platen (12);
a carriage (22) adjacent to, but spaced from, the platen (12)
to permit passage of a recording media (14) therebetween along a

media feed path (19), the media feed path having a width effective
to cover a first portion of the platen while leaving exposed a second

portion of the platen;
the carriage (22) being configured to move bidirectionally across
the platen (12) to be positionable (a) over the first portion of the

platen associated with the media path (19), and (b) over the second
portion of the platen outside of the media path;
a printhead (40) disposed on the carriage (22) to form printed
images;
an optically responsive platen demarcation (70) formed as an aperture in the
second portion of the platen (12) outside of the media path (19);
an optical sensor (50) disposed on the carriage (12), the optical
sensor (50) having a light source oriented to emit a light beam

toward the platen and a light sensitive detector aligned to detect
reflected light, the optical sensor (50) generating a position signal

when the platen demarcation (70) is detected; and
a control subsystem (60) operably coupled to the optical
sensor (50) to determine position of the carriage (22) relative to the

platen (12) in response to optical identification of the platen
demarcation (70) by the optical sensor (50).
A printing system according to claim 1 wherein:

the platen (12) has a center region (17) and two opposing end
regions (21, 23), the center region defining the first portion of the

platen and the end regions defining the second portion of the platen;
the printing system further comprises:
an optically responsive platen demarcation (70, 72) formed as an aperture in the
platen at each of the two opposing end regions (21, 23), the carriage (22)

being operable to position the optical sensor (50) sequentially over
a first platen demarcation (70) at one end region (21) of the platen

and then over a second platen demarcation (72) at the other end
region (23) of the platen; and
a monitor (34) for measuring the distance traveled by the
carriage (22) from the first demarcation (70) to the second

demarcation (72).
A method of operating a shuttle-type printer, the
shuttle-type printer having a platen (12) with one or more optically

responsive demarcations (70, 72) each formed as an aperture in the platen, a carriage (22)
which moves bidirectionally across the platen, and a printhead (40)

and an optical sensor (50) mounted on the carriage, the method
comprising the following steps:


moving the carriage (22) in a direction across the platen (12)
and until the optical sensor (50) detects a first optically responsive

demarcation (70) on the platen;
generating a first position signal when the first platen
demarcation (70) is optically detected; and
determining an initial position of the carriage (22) relative to

the platen (12) in response to the first position signal.
A method according to claim 3 comprising the following
additional steps:


moving the carriage (22) in a direction away from the first
platen demarcation (70) across the platen (12) and until the optical

sensor (50) detects a second optically responsive demarcation (72) on
the platen;
generating a second position signal indicative of a final position
of the carriage (22) relative to the platen in response to optically

detecting the second platen demarcation (72); and

displacement distances in response to the error.
A method according to claim 3 comprising the following
