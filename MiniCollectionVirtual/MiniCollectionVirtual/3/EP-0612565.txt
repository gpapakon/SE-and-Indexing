<ABSTRACT>
A rotor for a swinging bucket centrifuge (1) with mounts for a plurality of swinging buckets (6) provides for the rotor to be constructed essentially as a horizontal disc (2) and for recesses (9) to be made in the disc, into which recesses (9) legs (12) of the swinging buckets (6) engage, the centrifugal force acting on the swinging buckets being transmitted in a load-transmitting fashion from the legs (12) to the radially outer edge of the respective slot (9) in the rotor disc (2).

Rotor with swinging buckets (6) for a swinging bucket 
centrifuge, in which the rotor (1) has mountings for several 

swinging buckets and is constructed substantially as a 
horizontal disc (2) and the swinging buckets (6) engage with 

lug-like shanks (12,22), free on one side, into associated 
recesses of the disc (2) and are held there in a swinging 

manner, and in which the recesses in the disc (2) are 
constructed as slits (9), into which the shanks (12,22) of 

the swinging buckets (6) engage, characterised in that the 
centrifugal force acting on the swinging buckets (6) is 

transferred, transferring load exclusively from the shanks 
(12) onto the radially outer edge (10) of the slit (9) in 

the rotor disc, in which the swinging buckets (6) consist of 
a plastic material and the shanks (12,22) consist of a metal 

material, which is connected with a ring member (13,14), 
which is embedded in the upper, collar-shaped region of the 

swinging buckets (6). 
Rotor according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
length of the shank (12) is selected so that the free lower 

end of the shank (12) is approximately on a horizontal line 
(17) with the base surface of the sleeve (7) of the swinging 

bucket (6). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the weight distribution of the shank 

(12,22) caused by its dimension is selected so that a weight 
balance (vertical position of the swinging bucket) exists 

compared with the dimension of the sleeve (7) of the 
swinging bucket (6) at the nominal rotational speed of the 

rotor (1). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the weight distribution of the shank 

(12,22) caused by its dimension is selected so that an  
 

unequal weight, i.e. an intentional sloping position of the 
swinging bucket, exists compared with the dimension of the 

sleeve (7) of the swinging bucket (6) at the nominal 
rotational speed of the rotor (1). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the length of the shank (12,22) is 

shorter than the axial length of the sleeve (7). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1, 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the shank (22) is offset approximately 

in a Z-shape. 
Rotor according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the free end (23) of the shank (22) 

lies against the rotor head (4). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the swinging bucket (6) is itself intended to 

receive the sample fluid. 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the swinging bucket (6) receives a 

small sample tube (8). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the longitudinal axis of the shank 

(12) forms an angle to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve 
(7) of the swinging bucket (6).
