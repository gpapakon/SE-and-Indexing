<ABSTRACT>
An inverter circuit (la) has first and second voltage supply lines (2 and 3), an input 
signal line signal (I) to be inverted and an output signal line (5) for supplying an 

inverted output signal (I). A transistor (Ql) has a first main electrode (s) coupled to 
the first voltage supply line (2), a control electrode (g) coupled to the input signal 

line 4 and a second main electrode (d) coupled to the output signal line (5). A load 
device (L) coupling the second main electrode (d) of the transistor (Ql) to the second 

voltage supply line (3) is in the form of a photosensitive element (Dl,D2) which is 
illuminated during operation of the inverter circuit so enabling a high output 

impedance load to be provided without having to use complementary transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inverter circuit especially but not exclusively to an 
inverter circuit suitable for use in the control circuitry of a two dimensional active 
matrix addressed array such as a thin-film, e.g. liquid crystal display, image sensor 
or memory array. An important aim in the field of thin film two-dimensional active matrix addressed 
arrays is to be able to integrate the necessary row and column drive circuitry on the 
same substrate as the actual array of elements, e.g. display elements, so as to 
enable reductions in manufacturing complexity, for example to reduce the number 
of connections between the actual array and the control circuitry, and possibly allow 
reductions in the area required for the control circuitry etc. One of the most basic components required to implement the control circuitry is an 
inverter circuit which forms the building block of control circuitry elements such as 
shift registers etc. A typical inverter circuit which may be formed, for example, from 
amorphous or polycrystalline silicon n-channel thin film transistors (TFTs) and can 
thus be relatively easily integrated on the same substrate as an active matrix 
addressed array comprises an input n channel TFT having its control electrode 
coupled to the input signal line which is to receive the signal to be inverted and one 
of its main (source and drain) electrodes coupled to a first voltage supply line. The 
other or second main electrode of the input TFT is coupled to one main electrode 
of a load n-channel TFT and to an output signal line from which the inverted output 
signal is taken. The other or second main electrode of the load TFT is coupled to 
a second voltage supply line while its control electrode is coupled either to the 
second voltage supply line or a separate third voltage supply line. Examples of such 
inverter circuits are described in many papers, for example, a paper entitled 
'Polysilicon TFT active-matrix LCD drivers' by A.G. Lewis, D.D. Lee, R.H. Bruce and 
Russel A. Martin published in the Society for Information Display (SID) International 
Symposium Anaheim California, May 6-10, 1991. Digest of Technical Papers  
 
Volume XXII at pages 535 to 538, and a paper entitled 'Integrated Shift register with 
poly CdSe-TFTs for frequencies up to 4MHz' by K. Khakzov, E. Lueder, T. Kallfars, 
J. Spachmann, J. Glueck and W. Otterbach published at pages 312-314 in the 
Proceedings of Eurodisplay 190, the Tenth International Display Research 
Conference held on 25-27 September 1990 in
