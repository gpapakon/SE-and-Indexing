<ABSTRACT>
An surgical stapling instrument is provided which 
uses a thermogenic energy preferably bipolar 

radiofrequency energy for cauterization and/or welding 
tissue. The instrument compresses tissue between one pole 

of a bipolar energy sources contained on a first 
interfacing surface and a second pole of a bipolar energy 

source contained on a second interfacing surface. Staples 
and thermogenic energy are applied to the compressed 

tissue. In a preferred embodiment a cutting means for 
cutting tissue is incorporated into the instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an instrument which uses a
stapling means and bipolar energy for cauterisation,
coagulation and/or tissue joining or welding in the
performance of surgical procedures.Surgical procedures requiring cutting of tissue can
cause bleeding at the site of the cutting. Before
surgeons had the means to control bleeding many surgical
procedures were quite difficult to perform because of
excessive blood loss. Hemostasis is even more crucial in
endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery where if the bleeding
is not kept under control, the laparoscopy must be
abandoned and the patient's body cut to perform open
surgery so that inaccessible bleeding may be controlled.Thus, various techniques have been adapted to control
bleeding with varying degrees of success such as, for
example, suturing, applying clips to blood vessels, and
stapling, as well as monopolar and bipolar electrocautery
and other thermogenic techniques. Advances in tissue
joining, tissue repair and wound closure also have
permitted surgical procedures previously not possible or
too risky.Initially, suturing was one of the primary means for
providing hemostasis and joining tissue. Before other
hemostatic and tissue repair means were introduced, 
surgeons had to spend a great deal of time sewing the
tissue of patients back together.Surgical clips were introduced as a means to close
off blood vessels, particularly when cutting highly
vascularized tissue. Application of surgical clips,
however, can be cumbersome in certain procedures. The
vessels must be identified. Then a clip must be
individually applied on both sides of the intended cut of
each identified vessel. Also, it may be difficult to find
some vessels, particularly where the vessel is surrounded
by fatty tissue.Surgical staplers have been effective in decreasing
the amount of time it takes to fasten tissue together.
There are various types of surgical staplers. Staplers
have been used for tissue joining, and to provide
hemostasis in conjunction with tissue cutting. Such
devices include, for example, linear and circular cutting
and stapling instruments. Typically, a linear cutter has
parallel rows of staples with a slot for a cutting means
to travel between the rows of staples. This type of
surgical stapler secures tissue for improved cutting,
joins layers of tissue, and provides hemostasis by
applying parallel rows of staples to layers of surrounding
tissue as the cutting means cuts between the parallel
rows. These types of cutting and stapling devices have
been used
