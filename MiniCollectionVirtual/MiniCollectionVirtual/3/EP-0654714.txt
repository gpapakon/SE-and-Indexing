<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing unit for 
developing an electrostatic latent image or a magnetic latent 
image using a two-component developer in which magnetic 
carrier particles and toner particles are mixed, in an 
electrophotographic copier, and the like. Conventionally, in an electrophotographic copier, a 
magnetic brush development type developing unit using a two-component 
developer, is used. This developing unit has a 
cylindrical developing sleeve and a magnet roller composed of 
a magnet body having a plurality of magnetic poles therein, 
and which is rotatably supported. Magnetic carriers, to which 
toner particles are adhered, are held on the surface of the 
developing sleeve, and conveyed to a developing area for 
development. This developing unit has the following features: 
control of triboelectricity of the toner particle is 
relatively easy; coagulation of toner particles rarely occurs; 
bristling of the magnetic brush is good; the frictional  
 
property of the surface of an image carrier is superior; and 
when the developing unit is also operated for cleaning, the 
cleaning effect is very satisfactory. Although, in this type 
of developing unit, control of the amount of toner with 
respect to that of the carrier particles is necessary, this 
type of developing unit is used very often. However, in the 
developing method in which this magnetic brush is rubbed on 
the surface of the image carrier for development, 
conventionally, the developer composed of the magnetic carrier 
particles having an average diameter in multiples of ten µm 
through multiples of hundred µm and the non-magnetic carrier 
having an average diameter of about 10 µm is used. Since the 
diameter of toner particles and carrier particles is large, 
problems exist in which a high quality image for reproducing 
fine lines or dots, or the difference of densities, can hardly 
be obtained. In order to obtain the high image quality, 
conventionally, many technologies such as, for example, resin 
coating of the carrier particle, and improvements in the 
magnet body in the developer conveyance body, have been used. 
However, stable and satisfactory images can not yet be 
obtained. Accordingly, in order to obtain higher quality 
images, the following has been considered that it is necessary 
to make the diameter of toner and carrier particles smaller. 
However, when the toner particles are reduced to an average 
particle size of not more than 20 µm, particularly not more 
than 10 µm, the following difficulties
