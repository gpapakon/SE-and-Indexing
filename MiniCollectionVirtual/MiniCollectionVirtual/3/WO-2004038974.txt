<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing improved accuracy of the calculation of the long-term average arrival rate (AAR) of an ATM packet stream is disclosed. Using this method, accurate synchronization of a receiver clock to a network clock is achieved. The invention measures the variable time interval, T, required to complete the arrival of a known and fixed number of data packets, C. Using a predetermined and relatively large number of data packets, a time interval measurement is accurately measured to very precise values. Because the time interval measurement is triggered precisely by the arrival of the first data packet to the complete arrival of the last data packet in the session, there is no quantization error with respect to the first and last data packet. AAR is then calculated as (C*S)/T, where S is the number of samples per data packet.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM AMD METHOD FOR MEASURING SAMPLE ARRIVAL RATES ON AN ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSPORT NETWORKCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION[0001] This application claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application, Serial No. 60/229,367, filed August 30, 2000, entitled "Improved Method Of Measuring Sample Arrival Rate For An Asynchronous Transport," which is incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention[0002] The invention relates generally to the synchronization of data transmissions over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, and specifically to a system and method for measuring long-term sample arrival rates in such networks .Description of the Related Art[0003] Standard analog faxes and modems are designed for use over analog telephone lines. However, these lines are expensive to use on a per-channel basis. Therefore, it is common in the industry to use Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based services for these transmissions, such as Symmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (SDSL) , in order to minimize the per channel cost of communication. ATM based services utilize sophisticated modulation schemes to pack data onto copper telephone wires. As a result, a number of analog signals can be combined with digital data for transmission over a single existing copper telephone line.[0004] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a typical ATM network. Both digital and analog data may be transmitted by a synchronous network platform such as a Public 

Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 110. The PSTN 110 includes a network clock 112. The PSTN 110 communicates with a communications hub 120. The communications hub 120 includes a hub codec 122 and a multiplexer/packetizer 124. Digital and analog data are sent from the PSTN 110 to the communications hub 120 where the analog signals are digitized by the hub codec 122. The rate of digitization, or sampling rate, is determined by the network clock 112. The digitized analog signals then pass through the multiplexer/packetizer 124, where the data is encapsulated into packets and sent over the network as a constant bit rate stream using an Asynchronous Transport Service 130, such as SDSL.[0005] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the receiving side of the ATM network. The data packets are sent over the asynchronous transport service 130 and are received by an Integrated Access Device (IAD) 200. The IAD 200 ultimately separates the digital data from the analog data and sends it on to end user services, such as digital devices 210 or a*nalog devices 220. Examples
