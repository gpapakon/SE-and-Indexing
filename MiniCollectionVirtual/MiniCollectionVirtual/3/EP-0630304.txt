Device for shooting foundry cores or 
moulds with moulding materials (1), comprising a 

shooting head (4) with an inlet side (2) and an 
outlet side (3), a shooting plate (6) associated 

with the outlet side of the shooting head (4) and 
accommodating at least one shooting nozzle (5), 

and a clamping head (7) associated with the 
shooting head (4) on the inlet side of said 

shooting head and comprising at least one air 
supply (8) for a sealing application of compressed 

air to the shooting head (4), the clamping head 
preferably being vertically movable by means of a 

cylinder-piston arrangement (9), and a filter (11) 
being provided in the flow path of the compressed 

air, characterised in that the filter (11) is 
arranged between the shooting head (4) and the 

clamping head (7) and, in order to swirl or 
uniformly distribute the compressed air flowing 

from the air supply (8) into the shooting head 
(4), is constructed as a streamline filter with 

slits (12) preferably extending parallel to one 
another. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the slits (12) are spaced 10 

to 15 mm, and preferably 12 mm, apart from one  
 

another and in that the filter (11) is preferably 

12 mm thick. 
Device according to either one of Claims 
1 and 2, characterised in that the width of the 

slits (12) is from 3/100 to 6/100 mm. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the slits (12) extend 

substantially parallel to one another and diverge 
on the inflow side, such that the webs (13) which 

are located between the gaps (12) taper on the 
inflow side, wherein the slits (12) conduct the 

compressed air into the shooting head (4) 
substantially in the longitudinal direction or at 

a common angle or at several different angles. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the filter (11) is 

made of stainless steel, preferably of special 
steel. 
Device according to any one of Claims 2 
to 5, characterised in that the filter (11) is 

retained by a ring (14) which is substantially 
adapted to the shooting head (4) or the clamping 

head (7); in that the ring (14) is releasably 
connected to either the shooting head (4) or the  

 
clamping head (7); and in that the filter (11) is 

optionally inserted in an inner edge cutout (15) 
of the ring (14) or secured bearing on the base of 

the edge cutout (15). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the ring (14) 

comprises a support rib (16) extending diagonally 
approximately in the centre thereof; in that the 

support rib (16) extends in one plane with the 
base of the edge cutout (15); and in that the 

filter inserted into the edge cutout (15) bears on 
the support rib (16) and on the base of the edge 

cutout (15). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the clamping head (7) 

is provided, on the side thereof which faces the 
shooting head (4), with a rib or a corresponding 

eye (17) formed approximately in the centre of 
said clamping head; in that the filter (11) is 

secured between the support rib (16) of the ring 
(14) and the rib (17) of the clamping head (7); 

and in that the ring (14) comprises seals (18) 
both on the side which faces the clamping head (7) 

and on the side which faces the shooting head (4), 
which seals seal between the ring (14) and the 

clamping head (7) on the one hand and between the  
 

ring (14) and the shooting head (4) on the other 
hand. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that at least two separate 

air supplies (8), which are separated from one 
another, are provided; in that the air supplies 

(8) are formed on the outer edge area (20) of the 
clamping head (7) and connected thereto, and are 

optionally formed as pipes, extend substantially 
along the clamping head (7), are connected 

securely to the clamping head (7) and additionally 
guide this in its vertical movement, wherein the 

compressed air being deflected, optionally via 
connection pieces (19) which are connected to the 

air guides (8), transversely to the clamping head 
(7), into the area thereof which faces the 

shooting head (4), and wherein the connection 
pieces (19) preferably deflect the compressed air 

flowing from the air supplies (8) by approximately 
90Â°. 
Device according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that the area of the clamping 

head (7) which faces the shooting head (4) is 
surrounded by an edge area (20) which projects 

downwards towards the shooting head (4); in that 
the connection pieces (19) are parts or integral  

 
components of the edge area (20); and in that, 

preferably, the areas of the connection pieces 
(19) which are subject to an increased abrasive 

wearing, ie. which are flowed towards directly by 
the compressed air, are produced as exchangeable 

expendable parts (21).
