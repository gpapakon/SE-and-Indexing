<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene resin 
composition comprising a crystalline polypropylene having a 
high stereoregularity and a terpene resin having no polar 
group and a petroleum resin having no polar group, a 
stretched film formed therefrom, and a multi-layer 
stretched film having a base layer formed therefrom; and a 
polypropylene resin composition comprising a crystalline 
polypropylene having a high stereoregularity and a 
hydrogenated petroleum resin, a press-through pack 
packaging polypropylene sheet formed therefrom and a press-through 
pack packaging polypropylene multi-layer sheet 
having a base layer formed therefrom. It has been well known that polyolefins such as 
crystalline polypropylene are obtained by polymerizing 
olefins in the presence of so-called Ziegler-Natta catalyst 
which comprises a compound of a transition metal of Group 
IV to Group VI in the periodic table and an organometallic 
compound of a metal of Group I to Group III of the periodic 
table. Recently, there have been made studies on a process 
in which crystalline polyolefins of high stereoregularity 
can be obtained with high polymerization activity using  
 
such catalysts as mentioned above, as described in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications No. 
209207/1986, No. 104810/1987, No. 104811/1987, No. 
104812/1987, No. 104813/1987, No. 311106/1989, No. 
318011/1989 and No. 166104/1990. Such a crystalline polypropylene having a high 
stereoregularity is high in rigidity and usually has a high 
heat distortion temperature, a high melting point and a 
high crystallization temperature, and hence it shows 
excellent properties such as high heat resistance, high 
crystallization speed and high transparency. Accordingly, 
the crystalline polypropylene has been applied to various 
uses such as containers and films. Though, a film made from the above-mentioned 
crystalline polypropylene has excellent water-vapor barrier 
properties as compared to a film comprising polyamide or 
polyester, it is not always sufficient in the water-vapor 
barrier properties to apply for the use in which an 
extremely high water-vapor barrier property is required, 
for example, a film for packaging a cigarette. Therefore, 
for such use that an extremely high water-vapor barrier 
property is required, the so-called K-OP film of which 
polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) is coated on the surface of 
a biaxially oriented polypropylene film (OPP film ) is 
usually used. However, the K-OP film has such problems 
that
