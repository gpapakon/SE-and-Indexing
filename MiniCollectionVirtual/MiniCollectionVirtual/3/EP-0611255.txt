<ABSTRACT>
Linear transmission with flexible traction member that can be used wherever oscillating linear movements are used with return transport of the conveyor. This original system with a number of variants provides an advantageous solution to the technical problems in the area concerned. The most significant point of the patent consists in that a speed difference arises between the flexible traction members (4 and 5) since the input discs (1 and 2) move at the same speed of rotation. In the direction of the conveyor (6), the flexible traction members (4 and 5) are guided around the delivery wheel (7), more specifically in such a way that the idle strand (8L) of flexible traction member (4) and the power-transmitting strand (9K) of flexible traction member (5) act on opposite sides of the delivery wheel (7). The speed difference is balanced out at the delivery wheel (7) by a rotation and a superimposed translation, with the result that the conveyor (6) is moved to one or the other side depending on the direction of the drive. The flexible traction members (4 and 5) are then guided via the conveyor (6) to the return pulleys (10 and 11).
