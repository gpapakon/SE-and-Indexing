<ABSTRACT>
A novel RS latch for use in asynchronous designs has been
provided. The RS latch is made scannable by the use of

additional circuitry which provides a basis for a scan chain
signal to propagate in and out the scannable RS latch. Such a

scannable RS latch greatly facilitates the testing of the
asynchronous design.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to asynchronous designs and, in 
particular but not limited to, asynchronous designs having a 
scan chain for testing such asynchronous designs. A synchronous design is a design whose outputs can only 
change in response to a logic transition of a predetermined 
signal, for example, a clock signal. Using a scan technique to 
test a synchronous design has been readily used by the prior art. 
In general, testing a synchronous design using a scan chain 
involves modifying the flip-flops within synchronous designs to 
have two additional inputs: (a) a scan input and (b) a scan enable 
input such that when the scan enable input is active, and a 
positive edge occurs on the clock input of the flip-flop, the 
logic value appearing on the scan input is stored in the flip-flop. 
This procedure is continued until all flip-flops are stored 
with their respective desired logic values. Upon the next 
clocking of the flip-flops, the stored logic values from the flip-flops 
are applied to combination logic to test such combination 
logic. The result of applying the logic values to the 
combinational logic is then captured by a subsequent clocking of 
the flip-flops wherein these results may also be shifted out via 
a scan out signal. As a result, because flip-flops are already 
present in synchronous designs, synchronous designs are 
desirable because they are easy to test. On the other hand, an asynchronous design is one whose 
inputs and outputs can change at any time. A major advantage 
of asynchronous design over synchronous designs is that 
asynchronous designs dissipate substantially less power than  
 
synchronous designs. This is so because asynchronous circuits 
only dissipate power when actively computing instead of on 
every clock cycle. And therefore, less power is consumed 
because there is less switching. However, asynchronous 
designs have been avoided because they are difficult to 
implement and difficult to test. Moreover, since asynchronous 
designs do not inherently include flip-flops, the above described 
scan chain technique for synchronous designs in not applicable. 
Hence, there exists a need for a technique and method for 
testing asynchronous designs. FIG. 1 illustrates a detailed logic diagram of a well known 
RS latch; FIG. 2 is a detailed logic diagram illustrating a prior art 
RS latch being utilized in an asynchronous design building block; FIG. 3 is a detailed block diagram of a plurality of 
asynchronous design building blocks, similar to the one shown 
in FIG. 2,
