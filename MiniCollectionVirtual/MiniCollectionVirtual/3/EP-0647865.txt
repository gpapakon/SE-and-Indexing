<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus to form a duplex-like fiber optic connector 
by maintaining plug (14,16) assemblies in a side-by-side 

relation to enable simultaneous mating with sleeves of a 
receptacle housing. The apparatus having a pair of 

separate housings (14,16), each housing having a chamber where 
one of the plug assemblies is retainably received. A 

retention member (68) is incorporated into one of the 
housings and a clasp (78) member is incorporated into the 

other of the housing. The clasp member and the 
retention member being retainably interconnected to hold 

the housings in a side-by-side relationship with float 
therebetween, whereby the float accommodates any 

misalignment between the plug assemblies and the 
sleeves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fiber connectors
and more particularly to an apparatus for
interconnecting plug assemblies in a side-by-side
relationship to form a duplex-like connector assembly
that permits simultaneous coupling and uncoupling of the
plug assemblies.In simple two station fiber optic communication
systems, an optical signal is transmitted along an
optical fiber from a transmission device, such as a
LASER or a LED, at one of the stations and a receiving
device, such as a photodetector, at the other station.
In order to achieve maximum transmission efficiency, the
longitudinal axis of the optical fiber must be precisely
aligned with the optical axis of the electro-optic
devices. Additionally, where the distances between the
transmission device and the receiving device are long,
multiple lengths of optical fiber are often connected
together. The longitudinal axis of these lengths of
fiber must also be precisely aligned to achieve maximum
signal transmission.The alignment of one optical fiber with another
optical fiber or electro-optic device is achieved
through the use of an optical fiber connector. These
connectors have a plug assembly that contains a fiber
optic ferrule for precisely positioning the end of the
optical fiber. Typically, the ferrule has a precision
cylindrical outer surface and a concentric bore for
receiving the end of the optical fiber therein. When
optical fibers are to be connected together or the
fibers are to be connected to an electro-optic device,
the ferrules are received within a precision sleeve to
establish the precise axial alignment required. In
order to maintain the plug assembly with the sleeve,
there are various configurations of fiber optic 
connectors, including connectors that screw-on, bayonet
lock or engage by a push-pull mechanism.In more complex communications systems, the two
stations communicate back-and-forth with each other.
For this type of system, it is most efficient to have a
pair of optical fibers running between stations, where
one fiber handles the transmission from the first
station to the second and the other fiber handles the
transmission from the second station to the first. This
enables signals to be transmitted simultaneously in both
directions, thereby increasing the speed of the system.In order to conveniently manage the corresponding
optical fibers there are a number of connectors, called
duplex connectors, that incorporate a pair of ferrules
into a single housing. It is often difficult to
establish the proper axial alignment

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for interconnecting plug assemblies of
optical fiber connectors in a side-by-side relationship comprising a first housing (14) and a

second housing (16), each said first (14) and second
(16) housing having a chamber (44) for retainably

receiving one of the respective plug assemblies (10), the first
(14) and second (16) housings being interconnected with

float therebetween,
characterised in that: the first housing (14) has a

retention member (66) and the second housing (16) has a
clasp member (78) wherein said retention member (66) is arranged to

be loosely engaged by said clasp member (78) to hold the housings in a side-by-side relationship thereby enabling
the first and second housings (14,16) to move relative

to each other.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said
retention member (66) is a retention plate (68) affixed

to the first housing (14) and offset therefrom and said
clasp member (78) comprises a pair of resilient arms (82) that

extend from the second housing (16) and enclasp said
retention plate (68).
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said
retention plate (68) includes a window (76) and at least

one of said resilient arms (82) includes a detent (90)
that is retainably received within said window (76) when

the first (14) and second (16) housings are
interconnected.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said
retention plate (68) includes a detent that prevents

said resilient arms (82) from disengaging said retention
plate (68).
The apparatus of claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein
said retention member (66) is integrally formed with the

first housing (14). 
The apparatus of claim 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,
wherein said clasp member (78) is integrally formed with

the second housing (16).
The apparatus of claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,
wherein at least one of the first (14) and second (16)

housings have a grip enhancing feature (41).
The apparatus of any claims 1 to 7, wherein at least one
of the first (14) and second (16) housings has a forward

bumper (98) thereon.
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 8, wherein at least one
of the first (14) and second (16) housings has a
