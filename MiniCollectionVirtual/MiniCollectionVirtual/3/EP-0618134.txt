<ABSTRACT>
An assembly is provided for supplying a plurality of 
container ends to a bag and folding the open end of the bag 

closed. The assembly comprises a bag retaining device for 
retaining the open end of the bag in a position for 

receiving the container ends. A positioning device is 
employed for positioning the container ends into the bag. 

The positioning device may include a trough for directing 
the container ends toward the open end of the bag, a 

separating device for separating a plurality of container 
ends, and a displacing member for inserting the plurality 

of container ends into the bag. The bag is longer than the 
plurality of container ends and thus has an empty portion 

near its open end after the container ends are inserted 
therein. A folding device is further provided for folding 

a part of the empty portion of the bag into overlapping 
relation with another part of the bag, wherein the folding 

device engages opposing surfaces of the empty portion of 
the bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the 
production of containers and, more particularly, to a 
method and apparatus which enhances one or more aspects of 
the bagging of container ends for distribution. In the container-making industry, containers are 
typically manufactured in at least two parts: a container 
body and at least one container end. The container body 
may be drawn and ironed such that only a single container 
end is required (two-piece container), or the container 
body may be formed by rolling a stamped sheet into 
cylindrical form and welding the seam such that two 
container ends are required (three-piece container). 
Regardless of the particular container structure, container 
manufacturers typically separately supply large quantities 
of container bodies and container ends to customers who 
introduce substances into the container bodies and 
subsequently attach the container end(s) to the container 
body. In this regard, a predetermined number or "stick" of 
container ends are typically packaged by the manufacturer 
in face-to-face relation in cylindrical bags having a 
diameter slightly greater than the container ends for 
shipment to the customer. The container end bagging process is generally 
initiated by counting and separating a stick of container  
 
ends and such has been automated to some degree in many 
existing systems. However, after this initial step many 
devices still require one or more manual operations. For 
instance, such operations include manually removing one of 
the container ends from the stick as a sample, manually 
positioning a bag onto/over a loading horn, manually 
inserting the stick of container ends into the bag, 
manually closing the open end of the bag, and manually 
securing the closed portion for shipment. As can be 
appreciated, devices incorporating one or more of these 
types of manual procedures can entail significant labor 
costs. In addition, many aspects of these types of manual 
operations, and particularly including the manual folding 
and securing of the bags, involves repetitive movements, 
potentially resulting in lost worker time and related 
costs. Various aspects of the container end bagging process 
have been automated to a degree in an attempt to increase 
production efficiency and/or overcome other deficiencies 
associated with the container end bagging process. For 
instance, devices are available for retrieving an empty bag 
and/or transporting such to a bagging station for receipt 
of container ends. Moreover, devices

<CLAIMS>
An assembly for providing a plurality of 
container ends to a bag having an open end, said assembly 

comprising: 
   means for retaining the open end of the bag in a 

position for receiving the container ends; 
   means for positioning the container ends into the bag, 

wherein the container ends define an occupied portion of 
the bag and wherein an empty portion of the bag is defined 

between the open end and the container end closest to the 
open end; and 

   means for folding a first part of the empty portion of 
the bag into overlapping relation with another part of the 

bag to close the open end of the bag, said means for 
folding engaging opposing surfaces of the empty portion. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
means for retaining is substantially free from engagement 

with an interior surface of the bag. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
means for retaining comprises: 

   a base portion having an orifice extending 
therethrough for receiving at least the open end of the 

bag, said orifice being defined by an inner surface; and 
   means for engaging an exterior portion of the bag 

against said inner surface. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 3, wherein said 
base portion comprises: 

   a substantially circumferential channel positioned 
about said inner surface, whereby the open end of the bag 

is retained within said channel by said means for engaging. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 4, wherein said 
means for engaging comprises: 

   at least one port in said channel of said base 
portion; and 

   means for drawing suction through said at least one 
port. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 1, further 
comprising: 

   means for automatically removing at least one of the 
container ends before being positioned within the bag. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
means for positioning comprises: 

   trough means for directing the container ends toward 
the open end of the bag. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 7, wherein said 
means for positioning further comprises: 

   means for providing a flow of container ends to said 
trough means. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 8, wherein said 
means for positioning further comprises: 

   means for separating the plurality of container ends 
from the flow of container ends. 
An assembly, as claimed in Claim 9, wherein a 
flow path is defined for the container ends within said 

trough means, and wherein said means for positioning 
further comprises: 

   a displacing member; 
   means for moving said displacing member between at 

least first and second positions, said displacing member 
being positioned out of said flow path when in said first 

position and at least partially within said flow path when 
in said second position, said displacing member passing 

through at least a portion of said trough means when moving 
to said second position; and 

   means for moving said displacing member toward the bag 
when said displacing member is in said second position, 

whereby said displacing member engages at least one of the 
plurality of container ends and displaces the container 

ends into the bag.
