<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the administration of an 
effective amount of 4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene1,1-bisphosphonic 
acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt including the monosodium 
salt trihydrate (alendronate) to treat periodontal disease in mammals, 
including humans. Periodontal disease (Pyorrhea) involves the 
inflammation and degeneration of tissues that surround and support 
mammalian teeth. These include the gingiva, alveolar bone, 
periodontal ligament, and cementum. Periodontitis or the loss of 
supporting bone is the latest stage of this progressive disorder and is 
the major cause of tooth loss in adults. Juveniles also experience a 
form of periodontitis which results in alveolar bone loss and 
subsequent loss of teeth. Identified causal factors for this disease 
include poor hygiene which leads to buildup of bacterial plaque; 
malocclusion, tartar buildup, food impaction, and faulty dental 
restorations. The rate of osseous bone loss (resorption) depends  
 
upon the severity of the above conditions or causative factors. 
Symptoms of periodontitis include deepening of the gingival pockets 
between the gingivae and the teeth; loss of attachment of the gums to 
the teeth; and bone loss. Microbes proliferate in the recessed areas 
and accelerate disease progression. Periodontal surgery remains the 
primary corrective measure of this disease. Periodontal surgery 
(scaling and planing), however, may induce or, at a minimum, is 
associated with periodontal bone loss. Antibiotics, astringent agents, and mouthwashes are not 
effective for long-term treatment of periodontal disease. Home care 
that includes brushing, rinsing, and flossing coupled with dental 
curettage and polishing help deter the disease. Other preventative 
treatments include hydrogen peroxide mouth rinses (3 percent H2O2 
in warm water). Carbamide peroxide (Urea hydrogen peroxide, 
CH6N2O3) is also used in the local treatment of minor infections and 
inflammation caused by periodontitis. Penicillin (1000-1500 
milligrams daily) or erythromycin may be used if severe oral signs 
or symptoms are present. An additional approach to the treatment of periodontal 
disease includes the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents to 
hinder disease progression. It is known according to U.S. Pat. No. 
4,677,132 that the analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent Etodolac 
may also inhibit bone resorption and bone loss associated with 
periodontal disease. Etodolac is a substituted pyrano [3,4 b] indole 
derivative. U.S. Pat. No.
