<ABSTRACT>
An applicator (10) for dosing a layer of filling (33) onto a 
substrate travelling on a continuously moving conveyor comprising a 

conveyor (11), a nozzle (28) having a mould opening (29) in its lower 
surface and provided with a means for supplying a filling (33) into the 

mould opening (29), means for reciprocating the nozzle (28) vertically 
above the conveyor (11) and horizontally in the direction of travel of 

the conveyor (11) so that in one cycle, 

a) the nozzle (28) descends so that the border of the mould opening 
(29) contacts a substrate (12) travelling on the conveyor (11), 
b) the filling (33) is fed into the mould opening (29), 
c) the nozzle (28) advances downstream at substantially the same 
speed as the conveyor (11) with the filling (33) in the mould opening 

(29) lying on the substrate (12), 
d) the nozzle (28) ascends leaving the moulded filling (33) forming 
a layer on the substrate (12), and 
e) the nozzle (28) retracts upstream to its original position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an applicator for 
dosing a layer of filling on a continuously moving 
substrate e.g. a dough travelling along a straight line. The accurate automatic moulding and dosing of a thin 
layer of sauce intermittently onto a sheeted dough 
travelling on a continuously moving conveyor is 
difficult to achieve, especially if the sauce is 
viscous. Filling is often applied by hand but, even by 
this method, it is still difficult to achieve the 
desired precision. A complex biscuit creaming machine is known from US-A-1,904,742. 
The machine comprises a train of biscuit platforms which during 
the creaming pass along a semicircular path beneath a co-operating 
rotary stencil plate mounted co-axially with the semicircular path. 
The machine provides means for individually lifting the biscuit pans 
for creaming.  
 We have devised a simple applicator for dosing a filling which 
is suitable for any type of pumpable filling independent 
of the viscosity, and whereby the filling may be applied 
with high precision with respect to position, shape and 
thickness. Accordingly, the present invention provides an 
applicator for dosing a layer of filling onto a 
substrate travelling on a continuously moving conveyor 
comprising a conveyor, a nozzle having a mould opening 
in its lower surface and provided with a means for 
supplying a filling into the the mould opening, means 
for reciprocating the nozzle 
horizontally in the direction of travel of 
the conveyor, characterised in that the applicator is adapted to dose 
the filling onto the substrate when the latter is travelling along a straight line, and in 
that means are further provided for reciprocating the nozzle vertically above the conveyor 
such that in one cycle, 
a) the nozzle descends so that the border of the mould 
opening contacts a substrate travelling on the conveyor,  b) the filling is fed into the mould opening,  c) the nozzle advances downstream at substantially the  
 
same speed as the conveyor with the filling in the mould 
opening lying on the substrate,  d) the nozzle ascends leaving the moulded filling 
forming a layer on the substrate, and  e) the nozzle retracts upstream to its original 
position. The conveyor is conveniently an endless belt and may be 
adapted to advance continuously or intermittently. The nozzle advantageously comprises a valve house whose 
lower surface is a base plate formed within which is a 
mould opening. The means for supplying a filling to the 
nozzle and the means for reciprocating the

An applicator (10) for dosing a layer of filling (33) onto a 
substrate (12) travelling on a continuously moving conveyor (11) 

comprising, a conveyor (11), a nozzle (28) having a mould opening (29) 
in its lower surface and provided with a means for 

supplying a filling (33) into the the mould opening (29), means 
for reciprocating the nozzle (28) 

and horizontally in the direction of travel of 
the conveyor (11) characterised in that the applicator is 

adapted to dose the filling (33) onto the substrate while the latter 
is travelling in a straight line, and in that means are further 

provided for reciprocating the nozzle (28) vertically above the 
conveyor, such

comprises a valve house (14) whose lower surface is a base 

plate (28) formed within which is a mould opening (29).

for supplying a filling (33) to the nozzle (28) and the means for 

reciprocating the nozzle are fitted to a valve tap (13) to
