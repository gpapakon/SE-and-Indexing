<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to transducers and in particular to 
a capacitance pressure transducer. A capacitance pressure transducer provides a capacitance that 
varies in proportion to a sensed pressure. As shown in Figure 1, a basic 
capacitance pressure transducer 1 includes two parallel plates 2 and 3 
whose capacitance is determined by plate separation and dielectric 
material. A variation in pressure flexes the pressure plate 2 and decreases 
its separation from the fixed plate 3. The variation in capacitance can be 
used to change the response of a parallel circuit or to change the 
frequency of a resonant circuit. The response or frequency is proportional 
to the sensed pressure. In certain applications, the capacitance pressure transducer must 
measure pressure while being subjected to high accelerations and 
vibrations. Because the pressure plate flexes in response to the 
accelerations and vibrations, the transducer falsely indicates a change in 
pressure. To eliminate error due to vibration and acceleration, the fixed plate 
is replaced with at least one reference plate. The transducer 4 of Figure 2 
includes a pressure diaphragm 5 and two reference diaphragms 6 and 7. 
Electrodes on the pressure diaphragm 5 and one reference diaphragm 6 
form a pressure capacitance, and electrodes on the reference diaphragms 
6 and 7 form a reference capacitance. This transducer 4 is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,689,999 which is issued to Allied-Signal, Inc., the 
assignee of the present invention. When the transducer 4 is subjected to  
 
a steady-state acceleration or to a vibratory force, the diaphragms 5-7 
move in phase. However, when the transducer 4 is subjected to a 
pressure, only the pressure diaphragm 5 moves. By analyzing the change 
in reference capacitance and subtracting it from the change in pressure 
capacitance, an accurate measurement of change in capacitance due 
solely to pressure is obtained. A ratio of the pressure and reference 
capacitances can be obtained from an oscillator disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,987,782 which is also issued to Allied-Signal, Inc. The diaphragms 5-7 and housing 8 of the transducer 4 are 
made of quartz and are fused together along the dotted lines 9. Resulting 
is a unitary structure. However, the quartz has a relatively high thermal elastic 
coefflcient, making it sensitive to temperature variations. The plot of 
Figure 3 reveals the error as a percentage of full scale pressure for a 
temperature cycle between 107°C (225°F) and -37°C (-35°F)
