<ABSTRACT>
A device for the connection of longitudinal control arm units (2, 3) to a wheel axle (4) of commercial vehicles, especially rigid axles of towed truck trailers or semi-trailers, comprises a holding device (6, 7) fixing at least one control arm part to the wheel axle in the respective end area of the wheel axle, with a guide plate determining the assembly position of the said control arm part. The guide plate is designed as a clamping body (14) respectively accommodating two outer surface areas of the wheel axle, lying opposite one another transversely to the direction of travel and held on the said axle in a non-positive and positive connecting engagement.

A device for connecting longitudinal guide rod units 
to a wheel axle of commercial vehicles, particularly rigid 

axles of towed or semi-mounted lorry trailers, consisting of 
a holding means for fixing on the wheel axle (4) at least 

one guide part (2, 3) in the respective end zone of said 
axle, with a bearing plate (22) which predetermines the 

installation position of the holding means, the bearing 
plate (22) being constructed as a clamping member (14), its 

respective clamping jaws (20, 21) accommodating two portions 
(17, 18) of the outer surface of the wheel axle (4) which 

are situated opposite each other in the direction of travel 
(5), said clamping member (14) being held on the wheel axle 

(4) in a positive and operative connecting engagement, 
characterised in that, in a pre-assembly position, the 

bearing plate (22) has on both sides of a vertical transverse 
median plane (26), an acutely angled inclination (27, 

28) on its underside (25), being fixed in the installed 
position in which it rests on a supporting surface (29) on 

the wheel axle (4) via a change in shape of its part which 
is disposed between the clamping jaws (20, 21). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
in its pre-assembly position, the clamping member (14) has 

two U-shaped spring brackets (6, 7) engaging over it and in 
that they are braced in the installation position. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that clamping jaws (20, 21) resting on respective external 

surface portions (17, 18) of the wheel axle (4), when in the 
pre-assembly position, have linear bearing zones (23, 24) 

while in the installed position they have a continuous and 
flat bearing area (23', 24').  

 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the two clamping jaws (20, 21) are each 

welded to the bearing plate part (22). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the clamping member (14) is constructed as a 

one-piece component. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the clamping member (14) is constructed as a steel casting. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the clamping member (14) is constructed as a forged part. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that in the pre-assembly position, the clamping 

jaws (20, 21) disposed on the respective inclined underside 
portions (31, 32) of the bearing plate part (22) offer a 

pressure initiating surface (33, 34) at least areas of which 
are convex to the external surface portions (17, 18) of the 

wheel axle (4). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the clamping jaws (20, 21) are in each case 

constructed as parts which, in the installed position, are 
disposed coaxially in respect of the median plane (30) 

through the guide rod parts (2, 3) and have symmetrical 
apertures (37, 38) to provide access to the spring brackets 

(6, 7). 
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the clamping jaw (20, 21) has in each case between the 

access apertures ( 37, 38) a central bearing zone (40) which 
is set back from respective outer bearing surfaces (41, 42).  

 
A device according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in 
that the external bearing surfaces (41, 42) in each case 

have a chamfer (43, 44) inclined in the direction of the 
access apertures (37, 38). 
A device according to claim 11, characterised in that 
in the pre-assembly position of the clamping jaws (20, 21) 

the linear bearing zones (23, 24) are formed over the respective 
chamfer (43, 44) on the bearing surfaces (41, 42). 
A device according to one of claims 10 to 12, characterised 
in that the external bearing surfaces (41, 42) have, 

in the pre-assembly position, an angle of inclination (45) 
which corresponds to the angles (27, 28) in the region of 

the bearing plate part (22). 
A device according to one of claims 10 to 13, characterised 
in that the edges of the external bearing surfaces 

(41, 42) merge into a shaped radius (46). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterised
