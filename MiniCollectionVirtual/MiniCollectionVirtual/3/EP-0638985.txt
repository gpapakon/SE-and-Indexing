<ABSTRACT>
DC-DC voltage converter with limiting of the pulsed current (I1), flowing in the main circuit on the primary side, by means of a first arrangement for current limiting by shortening of turn-on (inrush) pulses, and with a second arrangement for current limiting by suppression of turn-on pulses. The arrangements for current limiting contain comparators (61, 62), which are connected by their non-inverting inputs to different taps of a common voltage divider (7), to which there is applied a variable (U10), which is dependent on the output voltage, for obtaining a feedback output characteristic in the current limiting situation. The DC-DC voltage converter is particularly suitable for applications in which output-side short circuits can be expected.
