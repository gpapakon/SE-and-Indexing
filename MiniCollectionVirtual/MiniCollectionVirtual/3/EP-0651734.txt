<ABSTRACT>
In the method proposed for the production of monocarboxylic acids from carbohydrates, carbohydrate derivatives or primary alcohols, the carbohydrates, carbohydrate derivatives or primary alcohols are oxidized continuously in aqueous solution at concentrations betweeen 0.1 and 60 % by oxygen or oxygen-containing gases, using noble-metal or mischmetal catalysts. The output flow of products thus formed is fed to an electrodialysis unit and the monocarboxylic acids removed and isolated.

alcohols,
characterised in that
carbohydrates, carbohydrate derivatives or primary 
alcohols are oxidized continuously in aqueous solution 

and concentrations between 0.1 and 60% with oxygen or 
oxygen-containing gases on noble metal or mixed metal 

catalysts, 
the volume flow of the products so formed is fed to an 
electrodialysis stage and the monocarboxylic acids are 

removed and obtained. 
Method according to claim 1,
characterised in that
non-oxidized educts are after the removal of the 
monocarboxylic acids fed to the oxidation stage once 

again. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
the flow of material is prior to entering the catalyst 
bed enriched bubble-free with oxygen. 
Method according to claim 3,
characterised in that
in the oxidation stage first of all a reactor is passed 
through, in which oxygen enrichment takes place by the 

introduction of air, of gaseous mixtures with higher 
oxygen partial pressures or pure oxygen as finelydistributed 

bubbles or bubble-free under pressure or 
pressureless, and 
that from the reactor a part flow is pumped through a 
tubular reactor disposed in parallel together with the 

catalysts. 
Method according to claim 3,
characterised in that
