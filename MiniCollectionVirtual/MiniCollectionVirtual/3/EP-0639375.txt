<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bile duct deterging 
composition and use thereof. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a bile duct deterging composition containing 
N-acetylcysteine primarily used in detailed examination and 
observation of the bile duct using cholangioscopy or cholangiography 
(both are generically referred to as detailed 
examination of the bile duct). The bile duct or biliary tract generally refers to a 
passage through which bile produced in the liver is transported 
to the duodenum. Specifically, the bile duct refers 
to a series of bile excretory routes that form the bilateral 
hepatic duct by the convergence of the intra-hepatic bile 
ductsin the liver, the common hepatic duct, the cystic duct 
carrying bile to and from the gallbladder, 
and also to the gallbladder storing the bile in the midway. In the adult, about 500 ml to 1500ml of bile is normally 
excreted per day to the duodenum via the bile duct. When 
the bile duct is obstructed because of exclusion caused by 
bile duct cancer and other kinds of cancers involving surrounding 
organs, cholestasis is generated in the bile  
 
duct with the result that the cholestasis promotes the 
precipitation and agglutination of the mucus of the bile 
duct and calcium bilirubinate. Moreover, with the bile 
infection from the duodenum being added because of cholestasis, 
biliary sludge and gallstones are produced in the bile 
duct. In addition, a complete obstruction of the bile duct 
produces obstructive jaundice. To release cholestasis and obstruction of the bile 
duct, doctors perform percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage (hereinafter simply referred to PTBD). A contrast 
medium can be injected directly into the bile duct to capture 
an image of the bile duct, which image forms a basis 
for diagnosing a pathological change in the bile duct such 
as gallstones and cancer which cause cholestasis and bile 
duct obstruction. Along with the development of optical 
apparatuses including a cholangioscopy, cases are increasing 
in recent years in which the PTBD-route is expanded to allow 
the cholangioscopy to be inserted therethrough for a detailed 
examination and observation of the bile duct thereby 
enabling diagnosis and treatment of pathological change in 
the bile duct with respect to cancer and gallstones which 
cause cholestasis and bile duct obstruction. However, when cholestasis occurs, direct cholangiography 
cannot provide a sufficient image of the biliary tree. In 
addition, even the use of cholangioscopy fails
