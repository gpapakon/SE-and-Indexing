<ABSTRACT>
A disc cartridge apparatus including a cartridge main 
body wherein a disc having an information bearing surface is 

rotatably accommodated and which is provided with an opening 
confronted by an optical pickup for recording or reproducing 

information signals to or from the disc, a sliding shutter 
installed in the cartridge main body in capable of sliding 

between a position where it covers the opening of the 
cartridge main body an another position where it uncovers the 

opening, and a plurality of detecting slits defined in right 
and left symmetry position on the cartridge main body through 

two sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a disc 
cartridge apparatus, and more particularly, to a disc 
cartridge apparatus which accommodates a circular disc such 
as an optical recording disc, a magneto-optic recording disc 
and a magnetic disc, having an opening defined for recording 
or reproducing signals therethrough to or from the disc, and 
more particularly, to such a disc cartridge apparatus which 
improves the arrangement of a plurality of the detecting 
slits for detecting by arranged one side (side A) and the 
other side (side B) of the double-sides recorded type disc, 
and a structure of the unintentional elimination preventing 
member for defining the prohibition of the lettering. Conventionally a disc cartridge rotatably accommodates a 
circular disc such as an optical recording disc, a 
magneto-optic recording disc and a magnetic disc in a 
cartridge main body comprising an upper case-half and a lower 
case-half which are butt-joined with each other. In the 
cartridge main body accommodating the circular disc as 
mentioned above, an opening confronting an optical pickup for 
recording or reproducing an information signal is defined in 
the main body in extending in the radial direction from 
nearly the center of the disc. The opening also confronts a 
disc turntable of a disc driving apparatus for rotating the 
disc with the optical pickup. And on the cartridge main  
 
body, a shutter formed by a thin metal plate or an 
engineering plastics for opening and closing the opening, is 
installed in capable of sliding. By the way, a typical conventional disc cartridge 
accommodates a magnetic disc or an optical disc. This type 
of disc cartridge is basically used for recording or 
reproducing to or from only its one side. Thus it records or 
reproduces by confronted one side to a pickup each other at 
all times when the disc cartridge is loaded on a disc drive 
apparatus. Here a fiducial pit (or groove) for defining the 
position necessary for a loading operation and a slot (or 
groove) for showing an unintentional elimination prevention 
(inhibition of write operation) are frequency formed on the 
single side disc cartridge main body. On the other hand, in consideration about a disc 
cartridge which is possible to record or reproduce 
information signals to or from the double sides of the disc, 
it had problems that the disc drive apparatus which records 
or reproduces by changing one aide (side A) with another side 
(side B) needs detecting slots for the the side A and for the 
the side

<CLAIMS>
A disc cartridge apparatus comprising: 
   a main body of a cartridge apparatus which accommodates a 

disc having a signal bearing surface rotatably and is 
provided with an opening confronted by a pickup for 

performing the recording or the reproduction of information 
signals to or from the accommodated disc; 

   a sliding shutter mounted to the main body of the 
cartridge apparatus in capable of sliding between positions 

where the opening is to be closed and opened; and 
   multiple detection ports provided at the left and right 

symmetrical positions penetrating the main body of the 
cartridge apparatus from the front through the back. 
A disc cartridge apparatus comprising: 
   a main body of a cartridge apparatus which accommodates a 

disc having a signal bearing surface rotatably and is 
provided with an opening confronted by a pickup for 

performing the recording or reproduction of information 
signals to or from the accommodated disc; 

   a sliding shutter mounted to the main body of the 
cartridge apparatus in capable of sliding between positions 

where the opening is to be closed and opened; and 
   an erroneous erasion preventive means integrally molded 

with the main body of the cartridge apparatus, which is 
 

provided with an elastic member with its one end fixed to the 
main body of the cartridge apparatus and the other end 

serving as a free-end, for defining writability of 
information to a disc by defining the position of the 

free-end of the elastic member. 
A disc cartridge apparatus comprising: 
   a main body of a cartridge apparatus which accommodates a 

disc having a signal bearing surface rotatably and is 
provided with an opening confronted by a pickup for 

performing the recording or reproduction of information 
signals to or from the accommodated disc; and 

   Groups of light detecting holes provided as multiple 
optical passing portions at the left and right symmetrical 

positions penetrating the main body of the cartridge 
apparatus from the front through the back, so designed that 

the space of the optical passing portions at respective sides 
is in accord with the space of multiple adjacent light 

emitting and light receiving elements. 
A disc cartridge apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the space between the light detecting hole groups is equal to 

or larger than the diameter of corresponding hole. 
A disc cartridge apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
adjoining the light detecting hole groups, the tip of the 

 
elastically displaceable erroneous erasion preventive member 

is positioned in each prescribed hole at the left and right 
side in such a structure that the erroneous erasion 

preventive member normally closes the hole and is deformed in 
the direction to leave the light detecting hole groups when 

exposing the hole. 
A disc cartridge apparatus comprising:
