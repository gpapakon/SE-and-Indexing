<DESCRIPTION>
 MODULAR RESONATORS FOR SUPPRESSING COMBUSTION INSTABILITIES IN GAS TURBINE POWER PLANTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to a resonator for suppressing acoustic energy in a combustion turbine power plant and, more specifically, to a modular resonator which may be placed at the location within the combustion turbine power plant having the highest acoustic pressure amplitude and, to a method of placing modular resonators throughout a combustion turbine at the location of the highest acoustic pressure.Background InformationTo reduce the amount of NOx emissions from a combustion turbine power plant, it is known to provide a lean-premix fuel to the power plant's combustor. A fuel-lean premix includes a fuel premixed with a large excess of air. While the fuel- lean premix reduces the amount of NOx emissions, high frequency combustion instabilities, commonly referred to as "high frequency dynamics" or "screech oscillations," result from burning rate fluctuations inside the combustors which consume the fuel-lean premix. These instabilities may create damaging pressure waves caused by burning rate fluctuations. It is desirable to provide a means of acoustic dampening to suppress the acoustic energy.One commonly used type of dampening device is a Helmholtz resonator. A Helmholtz resonator provides a closed cavity having one sidewall with openings therethrough. The fluid inertia of the gases within the pattern of holes is reacted by the volumetric stiffness of the closed cavity, producing a resonance in the velocity of flow through the holes. This flow oscillation has a well-defined natural frequency and provides an effective mechanism for absorbing acoustic energy.Prior art Helmholtz resonators have been in the form of monolithic liners extending over large areas of the combustion chamber walls. Such monolithic liners can be subject to high thermal stress due to the large temperature differences that may occur between the combustion chamber liner and outer walls of the combustion chamber. Monolithic liners may also be difficult to install as the components may interfere with other components of the combustion turbine power plant. Because of these conflicts, monolithic liners are typically restricted to use near the head of a 

combustor. Additionally, the monolithic liners are supported by circumferentially oriented ribs, honeycomb cells, or other means which provide a compartmentation of the area behind the liner. These structures result in complex, sealed compartment
