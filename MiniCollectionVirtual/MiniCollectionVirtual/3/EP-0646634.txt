<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel unthickened deicing agent and antiicing agent for aircraft which essentially comprises glycols and water as principal components, at least one nonionic surfactant from the group consisting of fatty alcohols and low-molecular-weight alkoxylates thereof and preferably a further anionic surfactant from the group consisting of alkali metal alkylarylsulphonates, corrosion inhibitors and optionally pH regulators. The new agent has a relatively long holdover time and therefore combines the advantages of unthickened and thickened aircraft deicing agents.

A de-icing composition and anti-icing composition
for aircraft which is based on glycols and water and

comprises essentially

a) 60 to 97% by weight of at least one glycol from
the group consisting of alkylene glycols having

2 to 3 carbon atoms and oxyalkylene glycols
having 4 to 6 carbon atoms,
b) 0.01 to 1% by weight of at least one nonionic
surfactant from the group consisting of fatty

alcohols and fatty alcohols which are alkoxylated
with a low molecular weight alkoxide and have 1

to 10 alkoxide units,
c) 0.01 to 0.8% by weight of at least one corrosion
inhibitor and
d) water as the remainder to make up 100% by weight,
the percentages by weight being based on the weight

of the composition.

surfactant from the group consisting of fatty

alcohols and fatty alcohols which are alkoxylated
with a low molecular weight alkoxide and

have 1 to 10 alkoxide units, 
b') 0.01 to 1% by weight of at least one anionic
surfactant from the group consisting of alkali

metal alkylarylsulfonates,
c) 0.01 to 0.8% by weight of at least one corrosion

d) water as the remainder to make up 100% by
weight.
A composition as claimed in claim 2 or 4, wherein
component b') is an anionic surfactant from the

group consisting of alkali metal alkylbenzenesulfonates
having 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl

group.
