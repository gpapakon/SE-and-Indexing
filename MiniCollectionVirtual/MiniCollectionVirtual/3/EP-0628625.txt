<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to a detergent composition or additive 
comprising a high level of bleach, a lipase and a double coated protease 

(e.g. Savinase 4.0 CT +). 
Also the use of said composition or additive wherein the lipolytic 
activity in the presence of protease remains unchanged is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
In order to enhance the overall cleaning of clothes bleaching agents have long
been used in laundry detergents.Using the bleaching agent various stains or soils on fabrics, textiles and
hard surfaces are oxidized. Because of their oxidizing power peroxygen
bleaching compounds like hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate or sodium
percarbonate have been found very useful in bleach formulations.Addition of certain organic compounds, including activators such as tetracetyl
ethylene diamine (TAED), to for instance perborate bleaches can improve the
bleaching performance because of the formation of peracids.Performance on greasy and enzymatic soils is however limited and therefore
generating a non-optimum consumers satisfaction. Thus there is still a need for
improvement of such bleach compositions.Enzymes represent an opportunity in this case having a specific advantage to
remove for instance grease in a very efficient way. EP-A-206 390 discloses the
inclusion of a certain, immunologically defined class of lipases in a detergent
composition which comprises a mixture of an anionic and a nonionic detergent.Although lipase shows a good activity, also in dry matrixes containing a high
bleach level, it appears however that when a protease (for instance Savinase®
4.0 T, ex Novo) is added the lipase activity becomes much more prone to the
attack by the protease.The result thereof is a dramatic loss of lipase activity in the wash solution. It is also known that enzyme stability in detergent compositions or additive is
reduced at certain storage conditions.In order to overcome these above-mentioned problems, Novo Industri A/S
presented a solution in the patent application WO 87/07292
by coating the enzymatic material showing an
improved stability at adverse conditions without any accompanying unwanted
side effects.EP-A-415 652 describes enzyme-containing oxidant bleach compositions
providing enzyme stability during prolonged storage in the presence of
oxidants, while supporting enzyme solubility. The improved product is
prepared by coating or encapsulating the enzyme with a water soluble alkali
metal silicate coating including at least one protective agent being selected
from transition metals andlor reducing agents.US-A-4,106,991 describes improved formation of enzymes granulates through
inclusion within the composition of finely divided cellulose fibres. Waxy
substance can optionally be employed for the granulating agent or to coat the
granulate.However adding standard protease (Savinase® 4.0 T, ex Novo) to the
composi
