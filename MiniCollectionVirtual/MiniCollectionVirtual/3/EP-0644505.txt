<ABSTRACT>
A display unit which can detect the X coordinate of a 
position with which a pen is in contact more efficiently. In a non-display 

period, X-electrodes are grouped into N regions according 
to the X-electrode arrangement, each region is divided into two 

parts according to the X-electrode arrangement, and selection 
voltage is applied to the X-electrodes belonging to each part 

having larger X coordinates. The process is repeated in order 
while N is doubled from one to the half value of the number of the 

X-electrodes of a liquid crystal panel. If a pen coming in contact 
with the liquid crystal panel and detecting X-electrode selection 

voltage detects selection voltage with respect to each N value, the 
Nth most significant bit of the X coordinate of the position with 

which the pen is in contact is set to '1.' If the pen does not detect 
selection voltage, the bit is set to '0.' Thus, the X-electrode of the 

position with which the pen is in contact can be detected at the 
number of selection voltage application times equal to the 

minimum number of bits that can represent each of the X-electrodes.

The present invention relates to a display device according to the preamble
of claim 1. This invention relates also to a display unit having a coordinate
input mechanism and in particular to coordinate input techniques thereof.For example, the display unit described in Japanese Patent

having a coordinate input mechanism.According to the display unit, a drive voltage pulse of a
display is detected by a pencil-like detector for finding the
coordinates of the position indicated with the detector. Therefore,
the display unit does not require an additional pressure-sensitive
tablet or the like for inputting coordinates.The display unit described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No.Hei 2-255911 will be discussed.Figure 40 shows the configuration of the display unit.In the figure, numeral 201 is a thin film EL panel, y0, y1, ...,
yn-1 are Y-electrodes, x0, x1, ..., xm-1 are X-electrodes, numeral
202 is a Y-electrode driver, and numeral 203 is an X-electrode
driver. Numeral 204 is a timing generator, numeral 205 is a 
pencil-like detector, for detecting coordinates, which will be
hereinafter simply called the pen, numeral 206 is an amplifier,
numeral 207 is a Y coordinate detector, and numeral 208 is an X
coordinate detector. The Y coordinates or lines on a display screen
of the thin film EL panel 201 are specified by the Y-electrodes and
the X coordinates or columns are specified by the X-electrodes.
The pixel corresponding to the X-electrode to which a selection
voltage is applied, on the line corresponding to the Y-electrode to
which a selection voltage is applied, on the thin film EL panel 201,
goes ON (is displayed).The operation of the display unit will be described with
reference to Figure 41.Figure 41 shows the timing of a drive voltage applied to the
Y- and X-electrodes of the thin film EL panel 201.As shown in Figure 41, in the display unit, the 1-frame
period required to display one screen is divided into the display
and Y coordinate detection mode period, for performing display
and Y coordinate detection, and the X coordinate detection mode
period for detecting X coordinates. The former is a period in
which voltage is applied to the X- and Y-electrodes for actual
display and the latter is a period in which voltage application for
display is not performed.The operation in the Y coordinate detection mode period is

The display device as claimed in claim 24, wherein

each of said X coordinates is defined by a number of log
2
m bits length in binary
notation;
each of said L voltage pulse application patterns being related to a different bit

of said log
2
m bits respectively; and
said X coordinate detection means being further adapted for determining the
value of each of the bits corresponding to the L voltage pulse application

patterns according to whether or not said detector (104) detects a voltage pulse
for the corresponding voltage pulse application patterns.
The display device as claimed in claim 26, wherein said voltage pulse
application pattern shifted by a mutually different shift amount S is the last of

the L voltage pulse application patterns.
The display device as claimed in claim 23, wherein said voltage pulse
application pattern supplying means is further adapted such that at least the last

three of said L voltage pulse application patterns are interleaved by an
additional voltage pulse application pattern for applying no voltage pulses to

said X-electrode driver (103). 
The display device as claimed in claim 21 or 22, wherein if said detector (104)
has an erroneous Y coordinate detection range, said Y coordinate detection

means has means (2201, 2205) for correcting the determined Y coordinate, by
adding to the determined Y coordinate a value conforming to said erroneous Y

coordinate detection range.
The display device as claimed in claim 21 or 22, wherein under a condition that
log
2
(m/Q) is an integer,

each of said L voltage pulse application patterns being for applying voltage
pulses to X-electrodes corresponding to columns included in every second

region, except columns nearby boundaries of the region.
The display device as claimed in claim 25 or 26, wherein each of said L voltage
pulse application patterns is for applying voltage pulses to X-electrodes

corresponding to columns included in every second region except columns
nearby boundaries of the region.
The display device as claimed in claim 21 or 22, further including means for
cancelling the detection of a voltage pulse by said detector if the voltage level of

the voltage pulse detected by said detector (104) does not satisfy a
predetermined voltage range.
The display device as claimed in claim 21 or 22, further including means for
detecting said detector (104) being in or out of contact with the display surface

of said flat display (101) and supplying the detection result.
An information processing system comprising: 

the display device as claimed in claim 21 or 22; and
a processor (2901) adapted for supplying data for specifying contents displayed
on said flat display (2401) to said display device, reading X and Y coordinates

determined by said X and Y coordinate detection means of said display device,
and performing processing in response to the reading of X and Y coordinates.
