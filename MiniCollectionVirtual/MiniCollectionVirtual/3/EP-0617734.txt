<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of proteases derived from
members of the genus Nocardiopsis in detergent additives or compositions, or wash
liquors, comprising specific bleaching systems.Bleaching systems have been suggested for incorporation into
detergent compositions in order to obtain bleaching effects on stained fabric, or in
order to prevent transfer of a textile dye from a dyed fabric to another fabric during
washing or rinsing.Detergent compositions or wash liquors comprising a bleaching system
have been described in e.g. International Patent Publications WO 89/09813 and WO
91/05839. Bleaching systems as described herein comprise enzymes exhibiting
peroxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide or a precursor thereof, or enzymes
exhibiting a suitable oxidase activity.A major drawback in applying such bleaching systems to detergent
compositions is that proteases present in such compositions may be strongly
affected by the bleaching systems, thereby hampering the washing performance of
the detergent composition.Some members of the genus Nocardiopsis are known to produce
proteases. In International Patent Application WO 88/03947, alkaline proteases
obtainable from protease producing strains of Nocardiopsis have been described
for their use as detergent additives, in particular as detergent additives for cold water
laundering. We have now surprisingly found that proteases derived from members
of the genus Nocardiopsis are more stable in the presence of the above mentioned
bleaching systems than other detergent proteases.Accordingly, the present invention provides a detergent composition
comprising a protease derived from a member of the genus Nocardiopsis, and: (a)
an enzyme exhibiting peroxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide or a precursor
thereof, and/or (b) an enzyme exhibiting a suitable oxidase activity.In another aspect, the invention provides a detergent additive
comprising a protease derived from a member of the genus Nocardiopsis, and: (a)
an enzyme exhibiting peroxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide or a precursor
thereof, and/or (b) an enzyme exhibiting a suitable oxidase activity.The present invention relates to proteases derived from members of
the genus Nocardiopsis, which proteases according to the invention have proved
to be stable in the presence of peroxidase based bleaching systems.More specifically, the invention relates to the use of proteases derived
from members of the genus Nocardiopsis in cleaning processes, e.g. household
laundering, industrial and institutional
