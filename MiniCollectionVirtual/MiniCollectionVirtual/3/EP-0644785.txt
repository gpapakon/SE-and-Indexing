<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for keeping the dispensing parts on a device for administering a sterile preparation for local treatment containing a preservative-free preparation free from bacterial growth. This is achieved in that the dispensing part is allowed to dry quickly after each use. The invention is also directed towards a cap to be used in this method. The cap (6) is provided with means allowing the dispensing part to dry quickly, such as openings (7, 8) and/or absorbent materials (18') at least partly facing the ambient air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for administering liquid, sterile preparations for
local treatment, such as nasal sprays and eye drops and more particularly to a dispensing
device comprising a dispensing part and a protection cap for the dispensing part. The
protection cap is provided with means allowing the dispensing part to dry quickly. The
present invention also relates to a method for facilitating the use of sterile preparations not
containing preservatives.Nasal sprays are usually administered by means of a bottle made of plastic or glass or
another equivalent receptacle containing a solution to be sprayed into the nostril. The bottle
is provided with a part for dispensing the preparation to the location to be treated, normally
a nasal tube or olive which is to be inserted into the nostril. The solution then is squirted
into the nostril by any suitable means, for instance by means of a pump, by deformation of
the bottle or by utilising a suitable propellant. After use the olive is covered by a cap in
order to protect the olive from damages, dirt and contamination. A typical device like this
is described in US 2,434,875. This document shows a dispensing device with a protection
cap which after each use of the device is provided on the dispensing part of the device to
protect it as described above. At the bottom flange of the protection cap inwardly
extending projections are provided which engage the flange of the lower part of the
dispensing part leaving spaces permitting passage of air to equalise the pressures inside the
protection cap and the surrounding container. The passages is of such narrow dimension
that passage of liquid is prevented except under pressure. After use, a small amount of the solution and possibly some mucus from the nostril usually
remains on the olive. These remains may form a base for the growth of bacteria and other
undesirable micro-organisms, since the solution need not necessarily be an antiseptic
solution and sometimes even contains ingredients that may serve as nutrients for the
bacteria. These bacteria then will be introduced into the nostril next time the nasal spray
device is used, by the same user or by another. This of course is undesirable. The bacteria
may also contaminate the contents of the bottle since there may be a direct connection
between the olive and the interior of the bottle, at least during some stage of the use.To avoid these problems normally a preservative intended to prevent the growth of bacteria
is added to the solution which is the

Dispensing device for dispensing a liquid, sterile,
preservati
ve-free preparation free from bacterial growth
comprising a dispensing part (3) and a protective cap (6,

6', 13) for said dispensing part, wherein said protective
cap (6, 6', 13) is provided with means allowing said

dispensing part to dry quickly 
characterised

in that said protective cap (6, 6', 13) is shaped as a
truncated cone or pyramid having a top end wall (10, 15, 15')

provided with at least one opening (7, 16, 16') allowing air to
have free access to said dispensing part (3).
Dispensing device according to claim 1, 
characterised

in that said at least one opening (7) is
centrally located in the top end wall (10) and
Dispensing device according to claim 2, 
characterised

in that said cap is further provided with
openings being in the form of longitudinal slits (8, 12).
Dispensing device according to any of claims 1, 2,
or 3, 
characterised
 in that the ratio of the
openings (7, 8, 12) relative to the total outer surface

of the cap is about 1:22.
Dispensing device according to claim 1, 2 or 3,

characterised
 in that said cap (6, 6', 13) is
provided with absorbent materials (18, 18', 19, 19')

contacting the dispensing outlet (5) of said dispensing
part (3) when the cap is placed in its normal position

covering the dispensing part, at least some parts of said
absorbent materials being in contact with the ambient

air.
Dispensing device according to claim 5,

characterised
 in that said absorbent
materials are located in the vicinity of said opening

in said end wall.
Dispensing device according to claim 6,

characterised
 in that said absorbent material
is in the shape of a plug (19, 19') held by projections

(20, 20') located on the inside of said cap, said plug
(19, 19') preferably being made in the shape of a sponge 

of a suitable material, for instance ethylenevinylacetate
foam or sintered polyethylene.
Dispensing device according to claim 6,

characterised
 in that said absorbent material
is in the shape of an elastic disc (18, 18') held by a

circumferential bead (17, 17'), said disc having a
diameter which is slightly larger than the inside

diameter of the of the cap adjacent said bead (17, 17'),
said disc thus being tensioned against the inside of the

cap, thereby obtaining a concave shape, the convex side
of the disc being oriented towards said dispensing outlet

(5).
