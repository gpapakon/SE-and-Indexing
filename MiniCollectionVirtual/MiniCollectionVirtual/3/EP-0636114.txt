<ABSTRACT>
Production of a branched olefin by isomerisation and transhydrogenation of at least one straight chain paraffin having 4 or more carbon atoms with a hydrogen-acceptor that is more highly unsaturated than a mono-olefin, followed by separation of the branched olefin and recycle of at least part of the remainder before the isomerisation and transhydrogenation stages.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of olefins and 
in particular to the production of branched chain olefins, 
particularly 2-methyl propene (iso-butene, hereinafter i-butene). i-Butene is a valuable chemical intermediate and is in 
increasing demand as a reactant for the production of methyl 
t-butyl ether (MTBE) by reaction of i-butene with methanol. 
i-Butene, and other branched chain olefins, are usually produced by 
subjecting a suitable paraffin stream containing straight chain 
paraffins, eg n-butane, to isomerisation by passage over a suitable 
catalyst, which is often a sodium aluminium silicate material such 
as Na-zeolite, to give branched chain paraffins, eg 2-methyl 
propane, (iso-butane, hereinafter i-butane). The resultant 
i-butane is then dehydrogenated to give i-butene. Also known are processes wherein straight chain 
paraffins, eg n-butane, are first dehydrogenated to the 
corresponding olefins, eg n-butenes, and then the olefins are 
subjected to isomerisation. In the present invention, the dehydrogenation is effected 
by a procedure termed transhydrogenation. In a transhydrogenation 
process a hydrogen-donor, such as a paraffin, is catalytically 
dehydrogenated in the presence of a hydrogen-acceptor such as an 
unsaturated compound so that the latter is hydrogenated at the same 
time. In effect, although this may not be the actual reaction 
mechanism, hydrogen is transferred from the hydrogen-donor to the 
hydrogen-acceptor, hydrogenating the latter. Transhydrogenation processes for the production of 
olefins have been described for example in US-A-3267170 and 
US-A-4684755 wherein a hydrogen-donor such as propane, n-butane, or 
i-butane, has been reacted over a catalyst with a mono-olefin such 
as ethene as a hydrogen-acceptor. In the reaction, the hydrogen-donor 
is dehydrogenated to the corresponding olefin while the 
hydrogen-acceptor is hydrogenated to the corresponding paraffin eg 
ethane. It is seen that there is no net production of olefin since 
for each mole of olefin produced from the paraffin, one olefin  
 
molecule is consumed as the hydrogen-acceptor. Indeed there may be 
a net reduction in the olefin content since the aforesaid 
US-A-3267170 discloses that the hydrogen-donor may be 
dehydrogenated further, to the corresponding diene, and/or that a 
mixture of the paraffin and the corresponding olefin may be 
dehydrogenated, by reaction with the hydrogen-acceptor olefin, to 
give a mixture of the olefin and diene corresponding to the 
paraffin. For example, it

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of a branched chain olefin 
comprises subjecting a hydrocarbon stream containing at least 

one straight chain paraffin having 4 or more carbon atoms to 
isomerisation and transhydrogenation with a stream containing 

at least one hydrogen-acceptor that is more highly unsaturated 
than a mono-olefin, thereby producing a stream containing at 

least one branched chain olefin product, separating said 
product to give a stream depleted of said product, and 

recycling at least part of the stream depleted of said product 
to before the isomerisation and transhydrogenation stages. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the hydrogen-acceptor 
stream comprises at least one diene and/or acetylene alone or 

in admixture with at least one mono-olefin and/or paraffin. 
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein a stream 
containing n-butane is subjected to isomerisation and 

transhydrogenation with a stream containing butadiene, thereby 
producing a stream containing i-butene which is separated by 

reaction with methanol to form methyl t-butyl ether to give 
the stream depleted in branched-chain olefin. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the 
isomerisation and/or transhydrogenation catalyst exhibits some 

activity for the isomerisation of olefins. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the 
isomerisation is effected before transhydrogenation, whereby 

the branched chain paraffin isomerisation product, and any 
residual straight chain paraffin in the product stream from 

the isomerisation stage, act as the hydrogen-donor.  
 
A process according to claim 5 wherein the isomerisation is 
effected in the presence of hydrogen, and the stream depleted 

of the branched chain olefin product is separated into a) a 
paraffin stream which is recycled to the isomerisation stage 

and b) an olefin stream which is added to the product stream 
from the isomerisation stage before transhydrogenation. 
A process according to claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the 
isomerisation is effected in the presence of hydrogen, and the 

hydrogen-acceptor stream is added to the product stream from 
the isomerisation stage before transhydrogenation. 
A process according to claim 5 wherein hydrogen is added to 
the product stream from the isomerisation stage before transhydrogenation. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
isomerisation is effected after transhydrogenation and the 

isomerisation catalyst also exhibits activity for the 
hydrogenation of olefins, and hydrogen present, or produced, 

in the transhydrogenation stage, is separated from the 
transhydrogenation product prior to isomerisation. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the 
transhydrogenation and isomerisation are effected together 

using i) catalyst exhibiting both transhydrogenation and 
isomerisation activity or ii) a mixture of a transhydrogenation 

catalyst and an isomerisation catalyst.
