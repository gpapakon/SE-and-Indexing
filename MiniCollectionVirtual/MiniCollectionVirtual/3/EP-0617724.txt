<ABSTRACT>
A material for reducing glare and reflection from reflective surfaces such as television screens, visual display units and windows. The material comprises a two part mixture of a lacquer and a flatting base. The lacquer consists of at least one C2-C6 aliphatic ester such as butyl acetate, at least one C1-C6 aliphatic alcohol such as n-butanol, at least one ketone such as acetone, nitrocellulose, a plasticizer such as diisoctyl phthalate, and an aromatic solvent such as benzene. The flatting base consists of an aromatic solvent such as benzene, a hydrocarbon solvent mixture, at least one C2-C6 aliphatic ester, synthetic silica, synthetic wax, an alkyd resin and an anti-settling agent such as caster oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a material for use in the
reduction of glare and reflection from reflective surfaces
such as television screens, visual display screens, digital
read-out screens, depth sounding screens, dial faced glass,
most reversed image screens, and windows.Glare and reflection are particular problems with VDUs
giving rise to headaches, eyestrain, irritated eyes,
blurred vision and many other symptoms. A large number of
attempts have been made to address these problems such as
by carefully arranging the background lighting, positioning
the VDU in the most appropriate viewing location and/or
using micromesh filters or glass or plastics films. None
of these has been entirely successful. Mesh filters are
one of the solutions to the problems of screen reflection
but they do have adverse effects and the majority are
extremely expensive.Attempts to address these problems have been made by
the use of compositions which are coated onto the
reflective surfaces. One such coating composition is the
subject of WO-A-90/14317. This composition comprises a
mixture of a resin binder, a plasticizer, an organic
solvent and a flatting agent.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide an expedient, inexpensive product for reducing
glare and reflection which obviates the problems of known
solutions.According to the present invention, there is provided
a composition for application to a reflective surface to
form a transparent solid layer thereon which reduces the
glare and/or reflection from the surface, said composition
comprising
(a) a lacquer comprising:
(i) 5 to 20% w/w of at least one C2-C6 aliphatic
ester, (ii) 1 to 5% w/w of at least one C1-C6 aliphatic
alcohol,(iii) 20 to 55.8% w/w of at least one C2-C8 ketone,(iv) 10 to 20% w/w of nitrocellulose,(v) 1 to 3.92% w/w of diisooctyl phthalate, and(vi) 1 to 5% w/w of an an aromatic solvent; and(b) a flatting base comprising:
(I) 1 to 38.25% w/w of an aromatic solvent,(II) 15 to 25% w/w of a hydrocarbon solvent mixture
containing up to 50% w/w aromatics,(III) up to 5% w/w of at least one C2-C6 aliphatic
ester,(IV) 5 to 10% w/w of silica,(V) 1 to 5% w/w of wax,(VI) 20 to 30% w/w of an alkyd resin, and(VII) 0.1 to 0.5% w/w of an anti-settling oil; and
   wherein the weight ratio of lacquer: flatting base is
in the range 5:1 to 20:1.The preferred C2-C6 aliphatic ester is butyl acetate.The C1-C6 aliphatic alcohol may be any of the common
alcohols but preferably one which is not too volatile. N-butanol
is preferred.Preferably, two ketones are
