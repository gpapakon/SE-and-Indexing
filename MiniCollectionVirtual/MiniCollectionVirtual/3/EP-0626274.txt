<ABSTRACT>
Male and female book binding strips are packaged 
in cassettes (31) and the respective cassettes are 

stacked in male and female hopper stations (66, 116). 
Punched sheets are deposited in a staging station. The 

components of the book are then assembled in an assembly 
station (121). Thus the stack of sheets is fed onto one 

jaw and one male strip is fed onto that jaw while a 
female strip is fed onto the opposite jaw superimposed 

above the first-mentioned jaw. The two jaws (123, 136) 
are moved toward each other until the stack is loosely 

held therebetween. Thereupon the jaws are pivoted to 
vertical position, the stack resting on a base plate 

attached to one jaw. The stack is jogged so that the 
holes in the sheets are aligned with each other and with 

the holes in the female strip. The male strip is pushed 
inward toward the stack, the studs fitting through the 

holes in the sheets and through the female strip. The 
assembled stack and strips are then moved into a bind 

station (201) where the strips are compressed together, 
excess stud length cut off and rivet heads formed on the 

severed ends of the studs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bookbinding and particularly, 
apparatus and method 
for automatically justifying sheets which are punched 
with holes spaced inward from one margin of the sheet 
by squaring the said one margin and two end margins 
so that the holes of the sheets are aligned, 
assembling such sheets with male and female plastic 
binding strips and then binding the sheets into books 
by compressing the strips so that the studs of one 
strip pass through the holes in the paper and the 
holes of the other binding strip, and then cutting 
off the excess stud length and forming rivet heads on 
the ends of the studs. As hereinafter described in detail, the machine has a 
frame supported above the floor on which are mounted 
several stations or subassemblies. At the staging 
station the sheets to be bound are deposted on a tray 
from which they are fed into the assembly station. 
Male binding strips packaged in cassettes are 
deposited in a male strip hopper and fed one at a  
 
time from the cassette and then fed laterally into 
the justify/assembly station. Simultaneously, in a 
female strip hopper the strips are fed one at a time 
from a cassette and then cross-fed laterally into the 
justify/assembly station. In the justify/assembly 
station, the sheets are jogged so as to square the 
edges of the sheets in common planes and thereby 
align the holes in the sheets. After such 
justification is completed, the male strips are 
pushed inward through the aligned holes in the 
sheets and through the holes in the female strip and 
then the assembled document is fed into the binding 
station. The binding station may be of several types 
using, for example, substantial portions of the 
machine shown in U. S. Patent 3,811,146, whereby the 
strips are compressed together, thereby compressing 
the sheets therebetween, the excess stud lengths are 
cut off and heads are formed on the severed ends of 
the studs, binding the book together. Books of the general type of the end product of the 
present invention are shown, among other places, in 
U.S. Reissue Patent 28202. Such books employ male 
and female binding strips such as are shown in Figs. 
1 and 2 of U.S. Patent 4,369,013. As has been 
stated, the binding station of the apparatus of the 
present invention employs a substantial portion of 
the machine shown in U.S. Patent 3,811,146. 
Initially, the strips are packaged in cassettes.  The apparatus of the present invention has several 
stations. In the staging station, the punched sheets are 
deposited
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing books for binding which 
comprises the steps of: 

   providing a stack of sheets each formed with 
first holes spaced from but adjacent an edge of said 

sheets and spaced apart in intervals; 
   providing a male strip having projecting studs 

spaced the same intervals as said first holes, 
   providing a female strip having a plurality of 

second holes spaced the same intervals as said first 
holes, 

   assembling said sheets, male strip and female strip 

with said female strip on a first side of said stack and 
said male strip in an initial position on a second side 

of said stack opposite said first side with said studs 
pointed toward but spaced from said stack, and 

   pushing said studs through said first holes and 
then through said second holes, 

   and in which said step of assembling comprises 
feeding said female strip laterally into position on said 

first side and feeding said male strip laterally into 
position on said second side. 
A method according to claim 1 which further 
comprises jogging said sheets to align said first holes 

with themselves and with said second holes and studs. 
A method according to claim 2 which further 
comprises positioning said sheets vetically and loosely 

supported against bending prior to jogging said sheets. 
A method according to claim 3, in which said 
step of jogging comprises supporting said first edges 

 
against a horizontal surface and rapidly biasing the 

outer corners of said stack toward said horizontal 
surface and inwardly toward each other. 
A method according to claim 4 in which said 
step of assembling comprises feeding said stack while 

horizontally positioned on a support transverse to said 
horizontal surface and substantially simultaneously 

feeding said male and female strips and then pivoting 
said support surface to vertical position. 
A method according to claim 5 in which said 
step of assembling further comprises positioning a second 

support parallel to said first support above said stack. 
A method according to claim 6 which further 
comprises moving said second support toward said 

first-mentioned support until said supports are spaced 
apart a distance greater than the thickness of said stack. 
A method according to claim 7 which further 
comprises sensing the thickness of said stack to 

determine the distance required to move said second 
support. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 8 
which further comprises binding a book by compressing 

said strips together with said stack of sheets 
therebetween so that the ends of said studs project 

beyond said female strip and cutting off the excess 
lengths of studs. 
A method according to claim 9 which further 
comprises forming rivet heads on the severed ends of said 

studs. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 10 in 
which said male strips are initially packaged in 

cassettes having spaced parallel side rails with inward 
facing channels slidably engaging the ends of said strips 

positioned side-by-side and in which said step of 
providing a male strip comprises 

   advancing one strip at a time out of a 
discharge end of a cassette in a first direction parallel 

to said channels and 
   cross-feeding said one strip in a second direction 

treansverse to said first direction to said initial 
postion. 
A method according to claim 11 in which step 
of advancing said one strip comprises applying pressure 

toward said one strip to the strip in said cassette most 
remote from said one strip to slide all strips in said 

cassette endwise along said channels of said cassette. 
A method according to claim 11 or claim 12 in 
which there are initially a plurality of cassettes and 

which further comprises sensing the absence of strips in 
a first said cassette, moving said first cassette to a 

remote position and moving a second cassette into the 
position initially occupied by said first cassette. 
A method according to claim 13 in which said 
plurality of cassettes are stacked and said cassettes are 

moved downward one at a time as emptied, said first 
direction being transverse to said downward movement. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 14 
which further comprises providing stud straightening 

guides and said step of pushing said studs includes 
pushing said studs through said guides into alignment 

with said first and second holes.
