<ABSTRACT>
Device on a vehicle with a loading area (10) and a flexible tarpaulin (46) which is arranged such that it can be stretched over the latter and can be secured laterally to the loading area as well as at a distance above the latter, in particular to a so-called top running rail. As fastening means between the tarpaulin and loading area at least one profile (12) is coupled laterally to the latter and transversely to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, and, at a distance from the joint, is provided with at least one recess for the releasable securing of a holding element of the tarpaulin.

Device on a vehicle comprising a platform (10) and a flexible cover (46) which is
stretched over the latter and can be secured laterally to the platform and at a

distance above it, in particular to what is referred to as a top guide rail,

characterised in that at least one profile (12) serving as a securing means between
the cover (46) and the platform (10) is hinged laterally on to the latter transversely

to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and is provided at a distance (n) from the
hinge point (17) with at least one moulded-in portion (42) for the releasable

securing of a holding element (48) for the cover.
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a hollow profile (12) extruded from
an aluminium alloy with a plurality of hollow chambers (26, 28, 30, 31) between a

top flange (32) and a bottom flange (34) and with at least one longitudinal channel
(42) moulded into the top flange or bottom flange and partially embraced by at

least one cantilever bar (44) or similar counter element directed towards the hinge
for a channel-shaped holding element (48) for the cover (46).
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised by at least one hinge (14)
serving as a swivel bearing for the hollow profile (12) to the end face of which a

swivel part (18) of the hinge is connected, the hinge and a hinge socket (16) firmly
secured to the platform (10) being traversed by an axle bolt (17).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the hinge (14) is
connected to the end wall (21) of the profile by means of connecting elements such

as screws (22).
Device according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that the cantilever bar (44)
is offset by an amount (i) towards the bottom flange (34) relative to the top flange

(32) of the hollow profile (12).
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the undercut
longitudinal channel (42) is provided with a bottom (35) reinforcing the bottom

flange (34). 
Device according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that the cantilever bar (44)
is offset by an amount (i) towards the top flange (32) relative to the bottom flange

(34) of the hollow profile (12).
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 4 or 7, characterised in that the
undercut longitudinal channel (42) is provided with a bottom reinforcing the

bottom flange (32).
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
cantilever bar (44) is aligned with the portion of the top flange (32t) or the offset

bottom flange (34) moulded on to it remote from the hinge.
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the
longitudinal channel (42) is embraced at least in portions by a reinforcing strip (58)

and the latter engages by means of holding members (56) in undercut longitudinal
grooves (54) at least partially associated with the longitudinal channel on either

side.
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the portion
of the top flange (32) on the hinge side is connected to the cantilever bar (44) by

means of a moulded-on web strip (60) and the latter is provided with openings
(62) for the holding elements (48) for the cover (46).
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the portion
of the bottom flange (34) on the hinge side is connected to the cantilever bar (44)

by means of a moulded-on web strip (60) and the latter is provided with openings
(62) for the holding elements (48) for the cover (46).
