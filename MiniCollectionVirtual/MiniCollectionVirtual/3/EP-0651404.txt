<ABSTRACT>
A transformer is used to charge the battery of an electric 
automobile (10). The primary of the transformer is connected 

to a fixed power supply (12) and is separable from a secondary 
mounted in the automobile (10). The secondary is cooled by a 

fluid heat exchanger mounted directly against the secondary 
winding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automobile charging transformer 
comprising a transformer primary inductive charge coupler for 
attachment to a fixed alternating current power supply, said 
coupler having a primary electric winding, a transformer 
secondary inductive charge receptacle for mounting in the 
automobile to charge the battery of the automobile, said 
transformer secondary inductive charge receptacle being sized 
to receive said coupler, a transformer secondary winding arranged 
adjacent said coupler, and a magnetic core associated with said 
primary electric winding and said secondary electric winding 
to complete the magnetic circuit through said primary and 
secondary windings when said coupler is in said receptacle, 
said transformer primary inductive charge coupler being separable 
from said transformer secondary inductive charge receptacle 
so that the automobile can depart from the fixed power supply. The invention relates further to an electric automobile 
having an electric propulsion motor and an electric battery 
connected to energize said propulsion motor and charging means 
for said battery so that said battery can be charged from a 
fixed power source being connected to a transformer primary 
inductive charge coupler having at least one transformer primary 
coil therein, said automobile comprising a transformer secondary 
inductive charge receptacle mounted on said automobile, said 
receptacle being sized such that said coupler can be fitted 
within said receptacle, an annular transformer secondary coil 
on at least one side of said receptacle so that said primary 
coil lies adjacent said secondary coil when said coupler is 
fitted within said receptacle, and magnetic core material 
associated with said primary and secondary coils to complete 
a magnetic circuit through said coils so that said coils are 
magnetically coupled when said inductive charge coupler is 
positioned within said inductive charge receptacle. Such an automobile charging transformer and such an electric 
automobile are known from EP-A-0 552 737.  
 Generally, the electric automobile battery is charged from 
an external source through a magnetic coupling comprising 
a transformer. The transformer secondary inductive 
charge receptacle is on the automobile. In order to reduce air pollution, there is a 
modern trend toward electrically powered automobiles. 
These electrically powered automobiles have rechargeable 
batteries therein. In each vehicle, the power of the 
batteries is used to propel the automobile and
