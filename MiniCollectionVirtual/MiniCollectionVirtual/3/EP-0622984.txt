<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for heat dissipation from an assembly which is suspended on anti-vibration mounts. In order to dissipate heat without adversely affecting the vibration damping, at least one helical strip (18) made of a highly thermally conductive material is fastened at one end to the assembly (12) and at the other end to a heat-conductive part (10). The assembly (12) can be mounted in the housing (10) via rubber bodies such that vibration is damped. The helical strip (18) can be thermally conductively connected to the outer surface of the assembly (12) at one end at various points (20, 22, 24, 26) which are axially offset with respect to one another, and can be thermally conductively connected to the inner surface of the housing (10) at the other end at various points (28, 30). In this case, the points (20, 22, 24, 26) at which the strip (18) is connected to the assembly (12) are expediently axially offset with respect to the points at which the strip (18) is connected to the housing (10). A plurality of helical, heat-dissipating strips (18) can be provided around the assembly (12). Cooling ducts can be formed in the housing (10), in the region of the strips. The helical strip (18) can be formed by a braid which is braided in the form of a strip.

Device for heat dissipation from an assembly (12), 
which is suspended in a way to damp oscillations, to a 

further component (10), comprising 

(a) at least one coiled strip (18), which consists at least 
partially of a well heat-conducting material, 
(b) which is arranged between a peripheral surface of the 
assembly (12) and an inner surface of the housing (10) 

which surrounds the assembly (12) touching the surfaces 
and 
(c) is connected positively with one of the surfaces 
wherein 
(d) the coiled strip (18) consists of a strip-shaped 
stranded wire strand of a well heat-conducting material 

and 
(e) the coiled strip (18) is connected, on one hand, 
positively, heat dissipating at at least two axial 

offset positions (20, 22, 24, 26) with a peripheral 
surface of the assembly (12) and, on the other hand, at 

at least two axial offset positions (28, 30) with an 
inner surface of the housing (10). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
positions (20, 22, 24, 26), at which the coiled strip 

(18) is connected with the assembly (12) are axial 
offset relative to the positions (28, 30) at which the 

strip (18) is connected with the housing (10).  
 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the assembly (12) is supported in the housing (10) 
in a way to damp oscillations by rubber bod
ies(14) 
which are independent of the strips (18). 
Device as claimed in one or several claims of claim 1 
to 3, 
characterized in that
 a plurality of heat 
dissipating strips (18) are provided around the 

assembly (12). 
Device as claimed in one or several claims of claim 1 
to 4, 
characterized in that
 cooling passages (32) are 
formed in the housing (10) in the region of the strips 

(18).
