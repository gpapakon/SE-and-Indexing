<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging assembly for products 
of small thickness such as LCD panels. An assembly for packaging LCD panels, or liquid crystal 
display panels, is known that uses a check-patterned container 
constructed by folding sheets of corrugated paper and has square 
compartments in which to insert folded sheets of corrugated 
paper holding LCD panels therein. On the bottom of the 
container are placed packings of styrene foam to cushion the 
panel holders. The process of producing the conventional assembly, 
including the manufacture of the necessary sheets, takes much 
time and trouble, however. Also, a relatively large amount of 
corrugated paper is necessary to produce the assembly. In 
addition, the assembly requires styrene foam to cushion the 
panel holders although such a material should not be used, if 
possible, for the product designed for disposal after use. Such 
a material is derived from petroleum, which is limited natural 
resources, and we should save such resources where possible. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a 
packaging assembly for LCD panels or the like which is 
relatively easy to produce. Another object of the invention is to provide a packaging 
assembly that requires only a relatively small amount of 
material. Still another object of the invention is to provide a 
packaging assembly that does not require styrene foam. A further object of the invention is to provide a set of 
sheets that enables one to produce a packaging assembly 
relatively easily.  
 According to the invention, there is provided a set of 
three sheets for producing a packaging assembly for products of 
small thickness, such as LCD panels. A first sheet is folded 
into a holding element; a second sheet, into a base structure; 
and a third sheet, into a cover member. No other materials, 
including styrene foam, is necessary. Corrugated paper, for 
example, can be used for the sheets. In view of the necessity or desirability of saving limited 
natural resources, such as petroleum, the possibility of 
producing such an assembly from materials like corrugated paper 
is a significant contribution to society and industry. Also, 
such flat materials can be conveyed very conveniently to a place 
of producing assemblies. Moreover, such materials are 
inexpensive, as well as effectively protecting products like LCD 
panel from shock. Figs. 1, 2, and 3 illustrate how to fold a first sheet into 
a holding element; Figs. 4, 5, and 6 illustrate how to fold a second sheet 
into
