<ABSTRACT>
A buffer or spacer (1) comprising a closed steel strip (7) 
substantially shaped like a regular or irregular 

parallelogram, which is welded to two supports (8, 9) in 
the form of strips (8, 9). 
The spacer (1) has the shape of a parallelepiped and is 
rigidly connected to the wavy blade (6) and to the post (4) 

by means of bolts or other fixing means. 
The support (8) of the blade (6) and the support (9) for 
the connection to the post (4), are made of a kind of steel 

having a different resistance with respect to the steel by 
which the closed strip (7) is formed. 
The supports (8, 9) may be provided with recesses or 
folding lines (12, 13) for a controlled deformation thereof 

and of the spacer (1), during the collision.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metal barriers for roads,
preventing the jumping over, or in any case decreasing the
risk of jumping over by a vehicle.
In particular, the invention relates to a metal road
barrier which includes specific rising spacers or buffers,
that is, of a kind which, besides absorbing energy during
light collisions, are also used to rise the blade in order
to improve the resistance to surmounting by a vehicle in
case of more serious collisions (see f.i. DE-A-1 759 575).Spacers or buffers having this function are already known,
and they are fixed to the posts of the barrier supporting a
triple-wave blade, a double-V blade (W) with opposite W-blades,
or a simple W-blade. These spacers are made by
steel plates having a central aperture with a substantially
quadrilateral shape. One side of the plate is rigidly
connected to the upper end of the post, whereas the
opposite end is connected to the wavy blade.
The spacer or buffer may also include other apertures, for
example circular apertures arranged along a circular arc,
for the purpose of obtaining a "controlled" deformation of
the buffer (plate), which allows it to fold itself
upwardly, causing the blade to "rise".The barriers which comprise this known kind of spacers or
buffers have an excessive lateral extension. There results that there is less space for the installation
of the barrier along the side of the road, and since the
embankment has a trapezoidal shape, driving the post in a
more external region with respect to the pavement of the
road, and using always the same length for the posts, the
letter will be driven by a reduced depth into the resistant
core; consequently the barrier will be less resistant to
collisions.The object of the present invention is to realize a spacer
or buffer of a so-called "rising" type, which overcomes the
aforesaid drawbacks, and which is therefore particularly
useful on bridges and on traffic dividers (median strips)
with modest width, where the extension of the barrier plays
a fundamental r√¥le.
The buffer or spacer of the present invention has a
completely different construction with respect to known
ones, it occupies less space, and it has exactly the same
functions.The invention will now be described by means of a preferred
embodiment thereof, with reference to the annexed drawings,
which are given for illustrative and non-limitative
purposes, and which show individually:

upper end the spacer or buffer of the present invention; Fig. 2,

<CLAIMS>
Rising buffer for metal road barriers,
comprising a closed steel strip (7) having a

quadrilateral longitudinal section, characterized in that said closed steel strip (7) is welded to a
strip or support (8) of the blade (6) and to a strip or

support (9) for the connection to a post (4) of the
barrier, said buffer having substantially a

parallelepipedal shape, and said supports (8, 9) having

recesses (12, 13) realized by drawing in order to allow a
controlled deformation of the supports (8, 9); said buffer

being further specified in that in order to postpone
the deformation step of the closed strip (7) with respect

to the deformation of the supports (8, 9), the latter are
obtained from steel being less resistant than

the steel which forms the closed strip (7).
Rising buffer according to claim 1, characterized in
that said supports (8, 9) and/or said closed strip (7) have

reinforcement elements or weakenings in the folded regions
or at the corners.
Buffer according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
a portion (18) of the support (9) for the rigid connection

to the post (4) is removed in order to reduce the amount of
the employed material.
Buffer according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in
that the thicknesses of the supports (8, 9) and of the 

closed strip (7), are different.
Buffer according to the preceding claims, characterized
in that the closed strip (7) has a longitudinal cross-section

substantially like a parallelogram.
Buffer according to the preceding claims, characterized
in that it is fixed to a blade (6) shaped like a triple-wave,

a double-wave, or two opposite W's, and in that the
form of the support (8) and the kind of bolts used are

varied correspondingly.
