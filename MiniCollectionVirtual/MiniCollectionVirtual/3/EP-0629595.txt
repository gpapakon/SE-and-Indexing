<DESCRIPTION>
The hot pressing process for consolidation of 
ceramic powders into dense polycrystalline materials 
involves simultaneous application of high temperature 
and uniaxial pressure. It is generally applied to 
achieve better properties than those achievable by 
pressureless sintering by obtaining very low porosity, 
finer grain size and better homogeneity. It is 
especially applicable to powders which are hard to 
sinter to high density by conventional means (high 
temperature only) because of inherent refractoriness of 
the compounds, poor powder characteristics (e.g., large 
agglomerates, low surface area) or a combination of the 
two. Such refractory compounds may include oxides 
(e.g., Al₂O₃, BeO) , nitrides (e.g., AlN, Si₃N₄, BN), 
carbides (e.g., SiC, B₄C, WC), and borides (e.g., TiB₂) 
as well as multicomponent phases. Because the pressure 
is applied in one direction, the technique is usually 
limited to shapes of high symmetry (i.e., flat plates, 
short rods and cylinders, etc.). Figure 1 illustrates a simple hot pressing 
configuration. Graphite tooling (e.g., rams and dies) 
is commonly used because of the desirable physical 
properties possessed by graphite (i.e., high 
refractoriness, good machinability, good high 
temperature strength, low friction coefficient and low 
coefficient of thermal expansion) as well as its low 
cost and availability. Graphite tooling, however 
degrades in air at high temperatures and therefore 
requires protective non-oxidizing atmospheres (which  
 
are often also needed to prevent oxidation of non-oxide 
powders being processed by hot pressing). A common problem associated with hot pressing thin 
pieces (e.g., less than 5 mm thick) is obtaining 
uniform die fill of the powder prior to processing. 
Non-uniform filling of the die can lead to thickness 
and property (e.g., density, strength) variations, as 
well as ram and/or die failure due to uneven stress 
distributions causing misalignment of the rams. 
Obtaining uniform die fill becomes exceedingly 
difficult as the area of the piece to be hot pressed 
increases and as attempts are made to simultaneously 
hot press several ceramic layers using graphite spacers 
between the powders (as is typically done to lower 
production costs). There are also problems associated 
with handling large quantities of powders during die 
filling. These include contamination from the die 
(particularly during the die filling step) as well as 
health hazards associated with airborne particulates.
