<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for labeling 
nucleosides and polynucleotides by purine ring-opening 
reactions, to labeled nucleosides and polynucleotides 
obtained by the ring-opening reactions, and to the use of 
the labeling reactions and labeled products to detect 
polynucleotides in a sample. The detection of polynucleotides is important in many 
areas of molecular biology, biochemistry, biology, 
pharmacology and clinical medicine, inter alia. 
Sometimes it is important to detect the presence per se 
of any polynucleotide in a sample, as is the case 
particularly for producing protein-based therapeutic 
agents intended for human use, for instance. Other times 
it is desired to detect a specific polynucleotide 
sequence present in a multitude of sequences. For 
instance, the diagnosis of genetic disorders depends on 
sequence-specific polynucleotide detection and sequence-specific 
nucleic acid hybridization probes play a central 
role in molecular biology research where they are used 
for the detection of specific, complementary nucleic acid 
sequences present in minute amounts in a background of 
large quantities of other polynucleotides. Assays 
involving nucleic acid hybridization in the future will 
be ubiquitous in the clinical lab, and will find 
widespread application in other areas, including, for 
instance, veterinary medicine, forensic medicine, plant 
breeding and other areas of agriculture.  
 Whether it is desired to detect the presence, 
per se, of polynucleotides in sample, or to detect a 
particular polynucleotide sequence, a key step is 
labeling the polynucleotide or polynucleotide probe with 
a detectable label. Generally, the specificity and 
sensitivity of a detection method will be at least partly 
determined by the properties of the detectable label and 
the efficiency of the labeling method used to introduce 
the label into the polynucleotide. Various labeling techniques have been developed that 
provide the selectivity and efficiency necessary to 
detect DNA present at fairly low levels in a sample, and 
to label hybridization probes sufficiently to detect 
specific sequences of DNA present in a high background of 
other sequences. For instance, radioisotopes such as 
3H, 14C, 32P, 35S and 125I have been incorporated into 
polynucleotides by metabolic, enzymatic and chemical 
means to serve as detectable reporter groups to indicate 
the presence of polynucleotides in a sample. 32P and 35S, 
have proven particularly useful in molecular biology 
studies in such
