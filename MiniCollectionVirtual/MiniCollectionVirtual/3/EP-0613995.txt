<ABSTRACT>
The internal combustion engine has at least one cylinder (5), in which a piston (8) is guided so as to be able to move. The piston has a piston rod (12) which is effectively connected, via a power transmission device (14, 16) to a crankshaft (2) mounted in the engine case (3). The power transmission device consists of a beam-like component connected to the piston rod (12), extending transversely to the crankshaft (2) and having a sliding track (15) curved in the direction of the crankshaft and of a sliding block (16) which is mounted on a crank pin (20) of the crankshaft and rests on the sliding track. The beam-like component (14) is supported on guide surfaces (23) in the case.

<CLAIMS>
A two-stroke reciprocating combustion engine having
 
   at least one cylinder which lies in a housing and in 

which is movably guided a piston exhibiting a pistonrod in 
operative connection via a power transmission mechanism with 

a crankshaft supported in the housing,
 
characterized in that the power transmission mechanism 

consists of a beamlike component which is connected to the 
pistonrod, extends transversely to the crankshaft and also 

exhibits a slideway curved towards the crankshaft, and of a 
slideblock which is supported on a crankpin of the crankshaft 

and rests against the slideway, and that the beamlike 
component is supported on guide-faces existing in the 

housing. 
An engine as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   slide-shoes are hinged to the beamlike component 

and bear against the guide-faces. 
An engine as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
 
   the beamlike component is so dimensioned that during its 

motion it can dip between the webs of the crankpin. 
An engine as in one of the Claims 1 to 3,
 
   characterized in that the beamlike component forms in 

the region of the slideway a flange which the slideblock 
embraces at the sides. 
An engine as in one of the Claims 1 to 4,
 
   characterized in that on the beamlike component 

auxiliary guide-bearings are arranged, which bear against 
the guide-faces.
