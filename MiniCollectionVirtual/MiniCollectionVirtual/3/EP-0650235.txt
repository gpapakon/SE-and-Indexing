<ABSTRACT>
According to a semiconductor laser device of the 
present invention, the thickness and carrier concentration 

of a current blocking layer (14) are set so 
as to cause a punch through on the current blocking 

layer (14) when the semiconductor laser device is driven 
at a current which is one to ten times as large as a 

maximum rated value of a DC driving current. Both a 
light absorbing layer (12) and a photocurrent blocking 

layer (13) are formed between the current blocking layer 
(14) and a second clad layer (3 to 6) in order to prevent 

a light turn-on phenomenon from occurring. The 
light absorbing layer (12) contacts the second clad 

layer (3 to 6) and is constituted of a semiconductor 
crystal of a p-type conductivity type, which is undoped 

or has a low concentration. The photocurrent blocking 
layer (13) contacts the current blocking layer (14) and 

is constituted of a semiconductor crystal of the p-type 
conductivity type. If the band gaps of the light 

absorbing layer (12), photocurrent blocking layer (13), 
and active layer (7) are represented by E

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ridge waveguide 
semiconductor laser device according to the preamble of claim 
1 and to a semiconductor laser device according to the 
preamble of claim 2. Semiconductor laser devices of this kind are known from 
JP-A-62 200 785. and JP-A-62 200 786. A structure of a 
conventional semiconductor laser device disclosed therein and 
called SBR structure or SBR laser is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
Therein, reference numeral 1 indicates a metallic  
 
electrode on the p side; 2, a cap layer of p-type GaAs 
formed to reduce the contact resistance; 3-6, a second 
clad layer of p-type InGaAlP; 7, an active layer of 
InGaP; 8, a first clad layer of n-type InGaAlP; 9, a 
substrate of n-type GaAs; 10, a metallic electrode on 
the n side; and 11, a current blocking layer (CBL) of 
n-type GaAs. The current supplied through the metallic electrode 
1 flows through the cap layer 2, clad layers 3 to 6, 
active layer 7, clad layer 8, and substrate 9 in this 
order, and drains away through the metallic electrode  
 
10. This current-flow is confined within a slit-shaped 
opening X formed in the current blocking layer 11. 
Therefore, it is the active layer just under the opening 
X, that is, directly under the ridge 4 where the current 
generates light gain. Lasing is achieved by cooperation of the above 
light gain, optical resonator, and an optical slab-waveguide 
constituted of the clad layers 3 to 6, active 
layer 7 and clad layer 8. The following are the dimensions and carrier concentrations 
of the main constituents of the SBR laser. 
The thickness of the CBL 11 is about 1.5 µm and the 
carrier concentration thereof is 3 × 1018 cm-3. The CBL 
has to be thicker than the hole diffusion length in it. 
Otherwise, electrons optically pumped in the CBL by the 
laser light compensate the depletion region of the 
reversed pn-junction and this junction eventually turns 
on (Photo-induced turn-on). Thickness of the active 
layer 7 is 0.02 to 0.08 µm. The clad layer 4 forms a 
ridge, the cross-section of which is trapezoid-shaped 
and 3 to 6 µm wide at the bottom. The total thickness 
of the clad layers 3 to 6 is 1 to 3 µm, while that of 
the clad layers 5 to 6 is 0.15 to 0.4 µm. The clad 
layer 8 is 1.0 to 1.5 µm thick. The length of an 
optical resonator, which is composed of opposed facet 
surfaces E1 and E2 is 400 to 800 µm. Though the current 
is effectively converted into laser light in the semiconductor 
laser device, still some part of it is changed 
into heat. The active layer re-absorbs
