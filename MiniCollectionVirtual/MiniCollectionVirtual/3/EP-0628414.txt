<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus is disclosed which is 
equipped with a recording head (9) for recording by 

discharging ink onto a recording medium. According to the 
invention, a plurality of waste ink storage members (55, 

70) for receiving waste ink is provided by utilizing the 
empty space within the apparatus. The waste ink is 

exhausted by a discharge recovery process in order to 
maintain a state of ink discharge in the recording head (9) 

at least in a good condition. Thus, the waste ink receiving 
capacity is increased whilst the entire apparatus is 

miniaturized because plural waste ink storage members (55, 
70) are installed by utilizing the empty space existing 

scattered within the ink jet recording apparatus as the 
space for the waste ink storage members (55, 70).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet recording
apparatus according to the preamble of the enclosed claim 1.For a recording apparatus, which conventionally records
on a recording medium (hereinafter called "recording sheet"
or simply "paper") such as paper and sheet for OHP, forms of
mounting a recording head using any of various recording
methods have been proposed. This recording head has
various methods such as wire dot, thermal, thermal transfer,
and ink jet methods.Especially the ink jet method directly jets ink on a
recording sheet, and draws attention as a quiet recording
method with low running cost.In a recording apparatus using the ink jet method, a
recording head, in which fine discharge ports have been
arranged, is generally used. When air bubble or dust enters 
the discharge port, or when ink has become unsuitable for
discharge or recording owing to thickening caused by
evaporation of ink solvent, etc., and the like, the state of
discharge is maintained or recovered by the following:
refreshing the ink by recovering the suction through the
discharge port or by predischarging, or allowing some
discharge ports, which are not concerned in discharge during
recording, to discharge ink in order to maintain all
discharge ports in a condition suitable for discharging
always.As a form of the means to maintain and recover the
discharge, there is a recording apparatus provided with a
cap member capable of covering the discharge port formation
surface of the recording head, and with suction means such
as pump means which communicates with this cap member and
applies a suction force to the discharge port of the
recording head.The factor for improper discharge is removed together
with the ink by discharging ink (predischarge, idle
discharge) by driving an ink discharge energy generating
element inside the discharge port while the cap is opposed
to the discharge port formation surface, or by forcibly
discharging ink by sucking ink through the discharge port by 
applying the suction force while the discharge port
formation surface is covered with the cap.In an appropriate position of the apparatus, on the
other hand, there is a waste ink tank provided to store
waste ink produced by the above-mentioned discharge recovery
process.To lead, into the waste ink tank, the ink received in a
discharge recovery apparatus including the cap, pump and
waste ink tube communicating these, etc. by the discharge
recovery process, a so-called "idle suction" operation, in
which the pump is operated while the cap is opened to

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet recording apparatus equipped with a recording
head (9) for recording by discharging ink onto a recording

medium, wherein waste ink is exhausted by a discharge
recovery process in order to maintain a state of ink discharge

in said recording head (9) at least in a good condition,
characterized in that

a plurality of waste ink storage members (55, 70) for receiving
said waste ink are integrated in said ink jet recording apparatus

as built-in members of the same by utilizing the empty
space within the apparatus. 
An ink jet recording apparatus according to claim
1, wherein, in said waste ink storage member (55, 70), a portion

of its surface is opened for communication of the interior
of the waste ink storage member (55, 70) with air through

a breathing fabric (183).
An ink jet recording apparatus according to claim
1 or 2, wherein said recording head (9) has an electro-thermal

converter (911) to apply heat energy which causes film boiling
in said ink as an element which generates energy to discharge

said ink.
An ink jet recording apparatus according to claim
1, wherein a first (55) and a second waste ink storage member

(70) each have a respective absorbing member therein. 
An ink jet recording apparatus according to claim
4, further including discharge recovery means for performing

the discharge recovery process, wherein said first waste ink
storage member (55) is disposed between said second waste ink

storage member (70) and said discharge recovery means, wherein
a moving means (11) for mounting said recording head (9) is

movable over a predetermined range (S) of movement, and
wherein said second waste ink storage member (70) is disposed

at a location adjacent to a central portion of said range of
movement (S).
An ink jet recording apparatus according to one of
claims 1 to 5, wherein said apparatus comprises (a) a conveyer

system, arranged to convey the recording medium to and from a

recording position, said waste ink storage members (55, 70)
having a surface and an aperture defined in said surface, respectively,

said aperture being covered with a breathable fabric
(183) to allow ink solvent vapor to escape from said waste

ink storage members (55, 70).
