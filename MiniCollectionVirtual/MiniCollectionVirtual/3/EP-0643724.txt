<DESCRIPTION>
 Process of Preparing 3-Carbonylandrostadiene 17-CarboxamidesThe present invention relates to an improved process for the conversion of substituted steroidal 3- halogen 3 , 5 diene derivatives to substituted steroidal 3 , 5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives . Such compounds are described in U . S . Patent No . 5 , 017 , 568 , issued on May 21 , 1991 to Holt , et al . as being useful in inhibiting steroid 5-α-reductase .Ban rnnnd of the InventionProcesses for the preparation of substituted steroidal 3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives from substituted steroidal 3-halogen 3,5 diene intermediates have previously been described. In particular the use of catalytic or alkyllithium mediated carboxylation of steroidal 3-bromo-3,5 diene intermediates to yield steroidal-3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives (in 15% yield when N-butyl lithium was used) is reported in U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568. The use of a basic medium, when applicable, to selectively deprotonate acidic hydrogen atoms of the brominated intermediate in the above reaction prior to the addition of a dehalogenating reagent has been shown to increase the yield of the resulting steroidal 3,5 diene-3-carboxylic acid derivative in U.S. Application No. 07/817,179 filed on January 6, 1992 (63% for the preparation of N-t-butyl- androst-3,5-diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid from N-t-butyl-androst-3,5-diene-3-bromo-17β-carboxamide) . Disclosed therein as preferred bases utilized in preparing said basic medium are ethylmagnesium bromide and ethylmagnesium chloride.In addition to a low overall yield, the principle shortcoming of these disclosures is that N-butyl lithium and ethylmagnesium bromide and ethylmagnesium chloride are expensive reagents adding significant cost to an industrial process. Further, N-butyl lithium is flammable and the carboxylation reaction is performed at 

dilute concentrations, Thus, there is a need in the art for a safe, economical and reliable method to convert substituted steroidal 3-halogen 3,5 diene derivatives to substituted steroidal 3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives.Summary of h Invention This invention relates to an improved process for converting steroidal 3-halogen 3,5 diene derivatives to steroidal 3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives.This invention specifically relates to an improved process for the preparation of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5- diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid.In a further aspect of the invention there are provided novel intermediates useful in the presently invented process.As used
