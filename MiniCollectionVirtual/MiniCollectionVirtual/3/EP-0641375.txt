<ABSTRACT>
Low sulfur gasoline of relatively high octane number is produced from a catalytically cracked, sulfur-containing naphtha by hydrodesulfurisation followed by treatment over an acidic catalyst, preferably an intermediate pore size zeolite such as ZSM-5. The treatment over the acidic catalyst in the second step restores the octane loss which takes place as a result of the hydrogenative treatment and results in a low sulfur gasoline product with an octane number comparable to that of the feed naphtha. A catalytically cracked naphtha from the FCC main column (10) is first hydrotreated in a hydrotreater (11) which it enters through inlet (12). From hydrotreater (11), the desulfurised naphtha passes through line (13) to the second reactor (14) in which it is contacted with ZSM-5 or another acidic catalyst, for example zeolite beta or MCM-22 where a controlled degree of cracking takes place with an octane, which was lost in the hydrotreater, being restored. The effluents from reactor (14) are separated and further processed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
upgrading of hydrocarbon streams, more particularly to a 
process for upgrading gasoline boiling range petroleum 
fractions containing substantial proportions of sulfur 
impurities. Heavy petroleum fractions, such as vacuum gas 
oil, or even resids such as atmospheric resids, may be 
catalytically cracked to lighter and more valuable 
products, especially gasoline. Catalytically cracked 
gasoline forms a major part of the gasoline product pool 
in the United States. It is conventional to recover the 
product of catalytic cracking and to fractionate the 
cracking products into various fractions such as light 
gases; naphtha, including light and heavy gasoline; 
distillate fractions, such as heating oil and Diesel fuel; 
lube oil base fractions; and heavier fractions. Where the petroleum fraction being catalytically 
cracked contains sulfur, the products of catalytic 
cracking usually contain sulfur impurities which normally 
require removal, usually by hydrotreating, in order to 
comply with the relevant product specifications. These 
specifications are expected to become more stringent in 
the future, possibly permitting no more than about 300 
ppmw sulfur in motor gasolines. In naphtha hydrotreating, 
the naphtha is contacted with a suitable hydrotreating 
catalyst at elevated temperature and somewhat elevated 
pressure in the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere. One 
suitable family of catalysts which has been widely used 
for this service is a combination of a Group VIII and a  
 
Group VI element, such as cobalt and molybdenum, on a 
suitable substrate, such as alumina. Sulfur impurities tend to concentrate in the 
heavy fraction of the gasoline, as noted in US-A-3,957,625 
which proposes a method of removing the sulfur by 
hydrodesulfurisation of the heavy fraction of the 
catalytically cracked gasoline so as to retain the octane 
contribution from the olefins which are found mainly in 
the lighter fraction. In one type of conventional, 
commercial operation, the heavy gasoline fraction is 
treated in this way. As an alternative, the selectivity 
for hydrodesulfurisation relative to olefin saturation may 
be shifted by suitable catalyst selection, for example, by 
the use of a magnesium oxide support instead of the more 
conventional alumina. In the hydrotreating of petroleum fractions, 
particularly naphthas, and most particularly heavy cracked 
gasoline, the molecules containing the sulfur atoms are 
mildly hydrocracked so as to release their sulfur,
