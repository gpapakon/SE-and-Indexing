<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a particle
analyzing apparatus for imaging a particle suspended in a
liquid. More specifically, the invention relates to a
particle analyzing apparatus for analyzing a particle by
introducing a sample liquid obtained by diluting blood,
urine, or the like into a flow cell and imaging an
individual particle such as a blood cell or a cell in urine.Among the conventional particle analyzing
apparatuses of the above kind are an apparatus called a flow
cytometer in which particles such as blood cells or other
cells are introduced into a flow cell in an arranged manner
and an individual particle is measured, and various particle
analyzing apparatuses which image a particle such as a blood
cell or some other cell and analyze the particle thus
imaged.An example of the flow cytometer is an imaging
flow cytometer disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. Hei. 5-142137 (United States Patent No.
5,272,354) in which a still particle image is obtained by
opening a shutter of an image intensifier having a high-speed
gating function with continuous light illumination.An example of the particle analyzing apparatus
is a method and apparatus for analyzing cells in a liquid in
which a particle detecting optical system is provided in
addition to an imaging system, and a pulsed laser is caused
to emit light with a predetermined delay after detection of
a particle to obtain a still image of the particle as
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Sho.
63-94156 (United States Patent No. 4,786,165).However, the above types of conventional
particle analyzing apparatuses have a problem that where a
flash lamp is used as a light source in imaging a particle
such as a blood cell or some other cell in a flow cell, a
clear image cannot be obtained when a sample liquid flows
fast. The light emitting period of a flash lamp is
in the order of microseconds, i.e.., is relatively long.
Therefore, when the light source having such a long light
emitting period is used, a particle moves more than 5 Âµm
if the flow speed of a sample liquid is assumed to be 5
m/sec. Thus, a clear image cannot be obtained due to
blurring.That is, with flash lamp type light sources, it
is difficult to attain a short light emitting period in the
order of nanoseconds, which is required to prevent blurring
from occurring in an image of a fast flowing particle. To
obtain a clear image, it is necessary to use, for example,
pulsed light sources such as a pulsed laser.However, when a laser such as a pulsed
