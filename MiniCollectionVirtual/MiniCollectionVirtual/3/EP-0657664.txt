<ABSTRACT>
A cam apparatus for transforming a linear motion into a rotational 
motion. The cam apparatus (1) within the 

start region or upon stoppage of a driving cylinder (4) serves as a 
drive member. A rotatable turret (2) serving as a follower 

member with follower rollers (22) is caused to confront a flat 
portion (10) of a slider (8). The shape of the cams or lobes improves the 

starting phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cam apparatus and more 
particularly to a cam apparatus which converts expansion 
motion of a piston of a cylinder into rotational motion of 
a turret. Needless to give an example as shown in Fig.37, a 
variety of types of mechanisms have been proposed which 
perform rotational motion of a rotary rod b serving as a 
follower member by utilizing expansion motion of a piston 
c of a cylinder a serving as both a drive member and a 
reciprocating engine. However, as will be seen from Fig.38 being a graphical 
representation showing motion characteristics of the piston, 
the cylinder a is started gradually within a uniform 
acceleration region of the piston c (this region will 
hereinafter be called a "start region" because the piston 
is about to start in this region. This region can also be 
called an "acceleration region" because the piston c is  
 
accelerated within the start region) and thereafter 
undergoes uniform velocity motion within a predetermined 
region (hereinafter, this region will be called a "uniform 
velocity region") to collide with a cylinder case while 
being moved at a velocity so as to stop eventually. For 
convenience of explanation, the time that the piston 
collides with the cylinder case and stops will be referred 
to as "upon stoppage". Accordingly, within the start region 
and upon stoppage, vibrations and shocks are caused, giving 
rise to a prior art problem that the follower member is 
prevented from smooth rotational motion at the beginning of 
its rotation and at the end of its rotation. The present invention intends to solve the above 
problem and it is an object of the invention to provide a 
cam apparatus which can apply constantly stable rotation to 
the turret standing for the follower member and can convert 
reciprocating motion into rotational motion without resort 
to complicated controlling. A cam apparatus according to the present invention 
comprises a rotatable turret serving as a follower member, 
a reciprocating engine serving as a motivator member for 
applying power to the turret, and a slider connected to a 
piston of the reciprocating engine to convert expansion  
 
motion of the piston into rotational motion of the turret 
and movable, together with the piston, relative to the 
turret. The slider is formed with flat portions at opposite 
end parts and a cam portion shaped to have a hill-valley 
form at a central part in a direction of travel of the 
slider, and the turret has a plurality of rollers arranged 
at the
