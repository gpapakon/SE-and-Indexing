<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catalytic burner, comprising an air supply and a fuel supply, in addition to at least one catalyst (5) and heat-absorbing wall sections (2), wherein heat is transferred from the catalyst to the wall sections mainly through radiation. The wall section has protuberances, between which a section of the catalyst adjusted to the contours of said protuberances is accommodated. A gap is provided between the protuberances of the wall sections and the section of the catalyst adjusted to the contours thereof. Said configuration enables a very large heat exchange surface to be obtained. Preferably, coolant channels (3) run through the wall section.
