 TITLE5 POS1TIVF PHOT RFSISTS CONTAINING SOLUBILITY ENHANCFR.ς'AField of the inventionThis invention relates to positive working photoresists.10 More particularly it pertains to photoresists containing resin, such as a polyimide precursor or a soluble polyimide, a photoactivatable acid generator, and a solubility enhancer, capable of promoting dissolution of the photoactivated portion of the resist, while it has no effect on the rest portion of the15 resist.Background of the InventionPositive working photoresists are known in the art. They 20 generally comprise film-forming polymeric resin binder containing a photoactive compound. The resin binders most frequently used are made from phenol-formaldehyde condensation products, such as Novolak for example. Positive resists are prepared using the novolak type resin by 25 incorporating therein a photoactive compound, for instance, one of the group of the 4-or 5-substituted diazonaphthoquinone (1 ,2)-diazide sulfonic acid esters. The alkali soluble novolak resins, when mixed with a photoactive acid-generating compound, become insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions. 30 However, areas exposed to actinic radiation become soluble to these alkaline solutions, called developers, as acidic groups are generated.Positive resists are most often used as masks to protect 35 substrates from chemical etchants in the manufacture of 

 semiconductors- In such manufacture, the photoresist is coated onto the surface of a semiconductor substrate, and then imaged and developed to remove areas subjected to actinic radiation. The resist image remaining on the surface of the substrate is usually employed as a protective mask to facilitate the selective etching of the exposed portions of the substrate thereby defining a circuit pattern.Etching of the substrate may be conventionally carried out by chemical treatment, or by dry etching, e.g. reactive ion etching with chemically active gas ions, such as fiuorocarbon species for example, formed by glow discharge. Additionally, modern techniques for processing semiconductors may call for plasma and sputter etching, ion bean implantation, and the like.One of the problems associated with these techniques is that many resist materials cannot withstand the process severity and are eroded along with the substrate, or flow due to reaction with the gaseous ions and the rather high temperatures often encountered on the semiconductor substrate (typically above 200 °C) resulting in loss of pattern resolution. For example, many novolak type phenol
