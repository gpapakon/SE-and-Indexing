<ABSTRACT>
A container for use in connection with the exposure of edible matter (28) to microwave radiation, which comprises a base tray (2) and a lid (12) in which the lid (12) is formed from a sheet of material which absorbs microwave radiation and is heated by it, and has a plurality of openings formed in it to allow escape of moisture during heating of the product, and in which the lid (12) is so folded or constructed that the distance through the openings from one side to the other side of the lid (12) is greater than the thickness of the material of the lid (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container for use in connection 
with the exposure of a product to microwave radiation, and to 
a method of exposing edible matter to microwave radiation. A product which is heated by microwave radiation is heated 
effectively from within the body of the product. The product 
is exposed to air which is cool and humid, compared with that 
to which a product might be exposed to in a conventional oven. 
Moreover, the period in which a product is exposed to microwave 
radiation in a microwave oven is generally very much less than 
the period of exposure to heat in a conventional oven. As a 
result, it is often found that it is not possible for adequate 
moisture to be lost from a product which is heated by exposure 
to microwave radiation so that, in the case of certain 
products, in particular edible products which are required to 
have a crisp external surface layer, the surface layer can be 
soggy and generally devoid of crispness. A number of packaging materials have been developed for use 
with microwave appliances in order to alleviate this problem. 
Such packaging materials include several materials capable of 
absorbing microwave energy, and converting that energy to heat. 
They are sometimes referred to as "microwave heat-reactive 
materials". The food product in question is covered, 
preferably enveloped, by the packaging material, and then sears 
due to exposure to the heat generated within the material by 
the microwave radiation. A known such packaging material is disclosed in EP-A-270838. 
It comprises a plastic film having a thin metallic coating 
applied to it. The film has a plurality of slits in the form 
of broken lines, in parallel, formed in it. The slits allow 
the material to be deformed so as to fit around a food product. 
Deformation of the material causes the slits to open. This 
known material has been found in certain circumstances to have  
 
the disadvantage that it can be difficult for a person to 
position the material around a food product satisfactorily to 
ensure that the product within the material is heated in a 
controlled manner, such that the exposure of the food product 
to the radiation is within desired limits, and that the 
characteristics of the heated food product are optimised. According to the present invention, it has been found that a 
food product can be exposed to microwave radiation so that the 
inner regions of the product are suitably heated, and that the 
surfaces of the product are dried and made crisp, by placing 
the

A container for use in connection with the exposure of 
edible matter to microwave radiation, which comprises a base 

tray (2) and a lid (12), the lid being formed from a sheet of 
a material which absorbs microwave radiation and is heated by 

it, the lid having a plurality of openings (14) extending 
through it, and being so folded or constructed that the 

distance through the openings from one side to the other side 
of the lid is greater than the thickness of the material of the 

lid. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, in which the said 
distance is at least about 5 times greater than the thickness 

of the material of the lid (12). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, in which the openings 
(14) are provided as slits. 
A container as claimed in claim 3, in which the slits 
(14) extend approximately parallel to one another. 
A container as claimed in claim 4, in which the slits 
(14) are arranged in parallel lines, with non-broken lid 

material between pairs of slits in each line, preferably with 
slits in a first line overlapping with non-broken lid material 

located between respective pairs of slits in an adjacent second 
line. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, in 
which the lid has a plurality of substantially parallel lines 

of weakness (46) extending across it along which the lid is or 
can be folded, and openings (48) extending through the lid 

along at least every alternate line of weakness, preferably 
with the openings spaced apart substantially regularly along 

the lines of weakness.  
 
A container as claimed in claim 6, in which the ratio of 
the transverse dimension of the openings (48) to the distance 

between adjacent lines of weakness has a value which is less 
than about 1.5. 
A container as claimed in any one of claim 1 to 7, in 
which openings in the lid are defined by at least three flaps 

arranged around the opening, and the flaps being folded out of 
the plane of the lid. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, in 
which material of the lid (12) comprises a metallised polymeric 

film, preferably comprising a polyester, the material of the 
lid preferably also including a laminated layer of paper. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, in 
which the lid (12) is attached to the base (2) along at least 

part of one edge of the base. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, in 
which the base is formed from the same material as th
at of the 
lid. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, in 
which the base is formed by folding or by moulding. 
A method of exposing edible matter to microwave 
radiation, which includes the step of placing the matter within 

a container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12. 
A method as claimed in claim 13, which includes the step 
of stretching the lid of the container to cause the openings to 

open.
