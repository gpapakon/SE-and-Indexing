<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of the design of scaffolding components, such as scaffolding junctions (1) and the associated connection elements (2), for a modular scaffolding of the novel construction type. The invention is distinguished in that the wedge-plug-in connection of scaffolding junctions and connection elements which is known in principle has been further developed such that the wedge-like plug-in elements are designed as straightforward wedge-like webs (6) which are arranged at the two ends of each horizontal spacer member (5) such that the web is fastened in the manner of a transverse horizontal member, seated on the wall of the horizontal spacer member or on a sleeve (4) pushed onto each horizontal-spacer-member end, and the wedge-like webs engage in each case into a pocket (8) of analogous shaping. The main advantage of the invention is constituted by the merits achieved by the vertical frame rigidity, for example reduction in materials and weight, possibility of savings in terms of vertical strutting, cuts in costs and reduction in assembly times. Furthermore, special locking means (12, 13, 14) are provided and supplementary elements (16, 17) are provided in order to absorb lateral transverse forces between scaffolding uprights (3) and connection element (2).

Joint and jointing element for scaffolding system with a star-shaped joint element (1) 
which can be mounted to a scaffold pole (3) ofthe scaffolding system and which has four pockets 

(8) into which wedge-shaped plug elements (6) engage which are attached to the jointing 
elements (2) within their end range in longitudinal direction and normal to the longitudinal axis of 

the jointing elements with the wedge-shaped plug elements (6) mounted at either end of each 
spacer rail (5) and the pockets (8) seating them have corresponding shapes, and with at least one 

opening (12) being made in the end (7) of the plug element protruding downwards beyond the 
bottom of the pocket (8) to take locking elements (13) in order to lock and to simultaneously 

brace the joints (1) and jointing elements (2, 5), 

and with additional elements being provided to take additional horizontal lateral forces between 
the scaffold pole (3) and the relevant jointing element (2, 5) to couple and, thus, block them 


wherein
 the wedge-shaped plug elements are made to be simple wedge-shaped webs (6), the web 
(6) being attached like a strut rail to the wall of the spacer rail (5) or to a sleeve (4) slipped over 

either end of the spacer rail, 
an acute angle a exists between the face (20) of the web (6) and the bottom (19) of the pocket 
(8), and the additional elements (16, 17), in the position of use, directly grip the scaffold pole (3) 

and partly embrace it. 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 1,
wherein
 each joint (1) is is made of a support segment (9) which corresponds to the section of the 
scaffold poles (3) and jointing elements (2), having a tubular or any other shape, and has a 

longitudinal slit or a clamping connection (10), with the four pockets (8) mounted to the support 
segment (9). 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 1 or 2,
wherein
 the side walls (18) of the pockets (8) are trapezoidal with a distance between the pocket 
bottom and the support segment (9) decreasing in the direction to the bottom (19) of the pocket 

(8). 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 1,
wherein
 in case of direct attachment of the web (6) to the spacer rail (5), the spacer rail is 
longitudinally slotted in axial direction within the plugging range of the web.  

 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 1,
wherein
 the end sleeves (4) with the webs (6) being slipped over the spacer rails (5) are welded 
to or pressed on these rails and are reliably blocked by subsequent spot beading (11) or other 

suitable measures. 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 5,
wherein
 the sleeves (4) are slotted in axial direction and, after the connection being performed, 
the web (6) is in the range of the slot. 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 1,
wherein
 in order to lock the locking element (13), holes (14) are made normal to the longitudinal 
axis or moving direction, respectively, of the locking element and, in the built-in condition, the 

first hole after penetration of the locking element (13) can take a spring bolt (15) or any other 
locking member if necessary, through the opening (12) in the end (7) of the web. 
Joint and jointing element of any of the Claims 1 to 8,
wherein
 the jointing elements (2) is additionally blocked to the scaffold pole (3) by the spacer rail 
(5) protruding in the direction of the scaffold pole (3) beyond the end sleeve (4) in a sufficient 

distance to embrace the scaffold pole (3) with the end zones of its face the section of which 
corresponds to the section of the scaffold pole (3). 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 8,
wherein
 the extension of the spacer rail (5) is plugged into the sleeve as an additional element 
(16) the section of which is matched with the section of the
 spacer rail or the sleeve (4), 
respectively. 
Joint and jointing element of Claim 1 and 8,
wherein
 the additional blocking engaging into the sleeve (4) is a socket (17) the face of which 
bears against the surface of the scaffold pole (3) and is welded to the spacer rail (5).
