<ABSTRACT>
The seawater to be desalinated is sprayed, in a finely divided manner, by means of nozzles (3) against a bottom side (1b) of a plate-shaped element (1). The element (1) is, for example, an aluminium plate which forms a heat transfer medium and is exposed through covering glass sheets (15) to solar radiation in a manner tracking the sun. The water sprayed onto the surface (1b) is distributed two-dimensionally over the element (1) and is evaporated by the heat stored in this element. The evaporated water passes through an outlet (27) to a condenser (10) in which the water vapour is condensed and is finally available at an outlet (12) as fresh water, for example for irrigating green (planted) areas. The seawater to be desalinated is preferably sprayed at predetermined intervals for only a few seconds against the bottom side of the element (1). To clean the element (1), seawater is sprayed against the bottom side of the element (1), for example every hour for about 1 to 1.5 minutes and, as a result, deposited salt and impurities are washed away.

Apparatus for the desalination of sea water, 
having a box-shaped container (2) in which an element (1) 

which can be heated by solar radiation is arranged and 
which possesses an inlet for the sea water to be desalinated 

and an outlet (27) for the water evaporated or 
vaporized at the element (1) and also a condenser (10) 

connected to the outlet (27), the element (1) possessing 
a lower evaporation surface (1b) which is arranged at an 

incline with respect to the earth's surface and means (3) 
being provided by which the evaporation surface (b) can 

be rinsed with the sea water to be desalinated, characterized 
in that the outlet (27) for the vaporized water 

is arranged in an upper area of the container (2), in 
that the vaporized water can be removed from the evaporation 

area through this outlet (27) and can be fed to the 
downstream condenser and in that the said means (3) 

possess at least one nozzle by which the sea water, when 
the apparatus is operated, can be sprayed or sprinkled 

with interruptions in a finely divided manner against the 
evaporation surface (1b), as a result of which the 

element (1) can, at intervals, be cooled and a salt crust 
which is formed can be rinsed away and during the interruptions 

the element (1) can be heated. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the element (1) is a plate which, on the solar 

irradiation side, closes off vapour-tightly an interior 
space (32) of the container (2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that heat insulation (31) is arranged in the  

 
container (2) at a distance to the element (1) on the 

opposite side to the solar irradiation. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the container (2) possesses, on the 

solar irradiation side, glass covers (15) which are 
transparent to the solar irradiation. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that, below the glass covers (15), there runs, in at 

least part of the area, a pipe (8) for feeding sea water 
to the said means (3). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a valve (5) is arranged in a feed 

line (8) for the sea water, which valve is controlled by 
a time controller in such a manner that the sea water to 

be desalinated can be conducted against the element (1) 
at predetermined intervals for comparatively short 

periods, for example a few seconds. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the valve (5), to clean the element (1) by the 

sprayed-on sea water, can be cooled and an adhering salt 
crust can be dissolved and rinsed away. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the valve (5), to clean the element (1), can be 

opened every 30 to 90 minutes for about 40 to 120 seconds. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the sea water can be sprinkled 

against the element (1) at predetermined intervals for 1 
to 6 seconds, preferably for about 2 to 4 seconds. 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the predetermined time interval can be about 60 to 

90 seconds. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the container (2) possesses means 

(14) by which the container (2) can track the sun. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that a collection tube (7) for the waste 

water is connected to the container (2) in a lower area. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 12,  
 

characterized in that the outlet (27) of the container is 
connected to a suction apparatus, for example a fan (11), 

and in that openings (22) through which external air can 
be drawn in are arranged in a lower area of the container 

(2). 
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the openings (22) are provided in an oversized 

collection tube (7). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the element (1) is an aluminium 

plate having a thickness of 3 to 5 mm. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the element (1) having, for 

example, a surrounding clamping strip (28) is attached 
vapour-tightly to a housing (23) made, for example, of 

aluminium sheet.
