Packaging material with an upper sheet (13) and a lower 
sheet (14) which are formed, and can be connected to each 

other, such that they form, in between them, uptake-compartments 
(11), for tablets and suchlike, arranged in 

at least one row, whereby both a said upper sheet (13) 
and lower sheet (14) are provided with cup-shaped 

cavities (15, 16) which combine, in each case, to form an 
uptake-compartment (11), characterized in that an upper 

sheet (13) and a lower sheet (14) are sheets of aluminium 
foil. 
Packaging material in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that cup-shaped cavities (15, 16), which 

have an oval base-area, substantially have, in their 
central area, a cylindrical form, and, at their end 

areas, a substantially spherical arch-form. 
Packaging material in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that said cup-shaped cavities (15, 16) 

have a separation between their lengthwise sides which is 
approximately half their width. 
Packaging material in accordance with any one of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that cup-shaped cavities (15, 16) 

have a separation between their short sides which 
corresponds to approximately a third of their length. 
Packaging material in accordance with any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the maximum depth of cup-shaped 

cavities (15, 16) is approximately half their 
greatest width.  

 
Packaging material in accordance with any one of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that cup-shaped cavities (15, 16) 

of an upper sheet (13) or of a lower sheet (14) have a 
flattened base. 
Packaging material in accordance with any one of claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that each row of uptake-compartments 

(11) has a rim-area (20) associated with it 
in which an upper sheet (13) and a lower sheet (14) are 

not connected to each other.
