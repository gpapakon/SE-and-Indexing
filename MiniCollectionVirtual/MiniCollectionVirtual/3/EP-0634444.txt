<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to expandable beads of a polymer of a 
vinylaromatic compound, such as polystyrene, containing blowing 

agent, plasticizer, common additives, and a strengthening agent, 
wherein the strengthening agent is cyclohexane. The invention also 

relates to the preparation of such beads, and mouldings produced 
from such beads. In particular, the invention relates to the use of 

a strengthening agent to improve the cross-breaking strength of the 
expanded mouldings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to expandable beads of a polymer of a 
vinylaromatic compound, such as polystyrene, to the preparation of 
such beads, and mouldings produced from such beads. In particular, 
the invention relates to the use of a strengthening agent to 
improve the cross-breaking strength of the expanded mouldings. Polystyrene beads are generally produced by free-radical 
suspension polymerisation of styrene, optionally containing comonomers, 
employing one or a mixture of initiators. To ascertain 
optimal results, generally a mixture of initiators such as 
described in e.g. US patent No. 4,129,703 is used at one or more 
separate temperature stages. To produce expandable polystyrene 
(EPS) beads, the beads are concurrently or subsequently impregnated 
with a blowing agent such as propane, butane, pentane, or any other 
blowing agent known in the art. By heating the beads above the 
boiling point of the blowing agent, but below the softening point 
of the polymer, the beads are expanded and - if carried out in a 
shaped mould - the desired article is formed. In addition to the blowing agent, EPS beads generally also 
contain additives such as plasticizers, solvents and flame retarding 
agents. Although the EPS beads and formed articles resulting from the 
expansion of the same are satisfactory in many respects, there 
remains a need for additives that besides being toxicologically 
acceptable, improve the final strength of the moulded article. Surprisingly, as part of a continuing programme to develop EPS 
material having improved strength characteristics in the final 
form, it has now been found that the use of cyclohexane as additive 
in (the production of) expandable polystyrene beads, drastically 
improves the strength of articles formed by expanding such beads. The cyclohexane may also be used in expandable beads of 
polymers of alpha-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene or similarly  
 
substituted styrene monomers and expandable beads of copolymers of 
the aforementioned monomers with or without styrene. It is to be 
understood that throughout the specification, were EPS is used, 
also such expandable polymers are meant. It is observed that although cyclohexane has been mentioned 
for use as blowing agent and/or plasticizer (for instance, European 
patent application No. 0,396,046 mentions as suitable blowing 
agents propane, butane, pentane, hexane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, 
cyclohexane, methyl chloride, dichlorodifluormethane and dichlorotetrafluorethane; 
whereas Japanese Kokai Nos. 55/125,130
