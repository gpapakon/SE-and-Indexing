<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for hard-facing steel saw blade core, the device having a frame (3), a clamp (1) designed to hold a steel saw blade or steel core (2) and a grinder (4) fitted on the frame (3). The device is compact and simple to operate, and has a low procurement cost, since the clamp is designed as a slide (1) which is mounted on a support (5) so that it can be moved along the support. The support (5) is delimited at one end by the grinder (4) and at the other end by a roller device (6) fixed to the frame (3), a control device (7) being fitted to the roller (6) for saw-blade tolerance-measurement purposes and, in addition, a displacable soldering bridge (8) being mounted on the frame (3).

Apparatus for providing steel saw blade cores 
with hard segments (29), having a frame (3), a clamp 

for holding a saw blade (2) and a grinder (4) on the 
frame (3), characterized in that the clamp is in the 

form of a slide (1) and is displaceably mounted on a 
support (5) which is delimited at one end by the 

grinder (4) and at the other end by a roller device (6) 
fixed to the frame (3), a control block (7) being 

coordinated with the roller device (6) and fixed to the 
frame, and furthermore a displaceable or rotatable 

solder bridge (8) being arranged on the frame (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim, 1, characterized 
in that the slide (1) can be equipped with 

interchangeable holders (9) for different saw blade 
dimensions. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the slide (1) can be displaced 

and locked with dimensional accuracy and/or that the 
holders (9), together with an inserted circular saw 

blade (2a), can be rotated either manually or by means 
of a gear motor (30). 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that a roller table (11) whose 

roller surface (12) is preferably rotatable about a 
vertical axis is installed laterally on the frame (3), 

in particular for holding bandsaw blades (2d). 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the grinder (4) has a 

frame (14) which can be rotated, in particular through 
90 degrees, and bears or holds at least one grinding 

wheel (15) and one drive motor (16). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the frame (14) is provided with a compound slide 

(17) which permits a vertical oscillating movement of 
the grinding wheel (15) at the circumference of the saw  

 
blade (2) as well as continuous advance of the grinding 

wheel feed, a pneumatic drive (18) preferably being 
provided for achieving the oscillating movement. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that an extractor (19) which 

preferably has a safety extraction hood (28) with a 
sight window (27) is associated with the frame (3), at 

least for the region of the grinder (4). 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the solder bridge (8) has 

cooling jaws (20) for cooling the solder points, which 
are preferably coolable by cooling liquid (22) from a 

liquid tank (23). 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the control block (7) has 

a precision spindle (24) and precision flanges (25) for 
mounting the saw blades (2), a cylinder (31), which is 

preferably pneumatically controllable, and an 
adjustable dial gauge (26) being associated with said 

control block.
