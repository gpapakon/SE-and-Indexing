<ABSTRACT>
Described are novel reversible photochromic 2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran compounds, examples of which are compounds having certain substituents at the number 5 carbon atom of the naphtho-portion of the naphthopyran and at the 2-position of the pyran ring. Certain substituents may also be present at the number 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbon atoms of the naphtho portion of the naphthopyran. Also described are organic host materials that contain or that are coated with such compounds. Articles such as ophthalmic lenses or other plastic transparencies that incorporate the novel naphthopyran compounds or combinations thereof with complementary photochromic compounds, e.g., spiro(indoline) type compounds, are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain novel naphthopyran compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to novel photochromic naphthopyran compounds and to compositions and articles containing such novel naphthopyran compounds. When exposed to light radiation involving ultraviolet rays, such as the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight or the light of a mercury lamp, many photochromic compounds exhibit a reversible change in color. When the ultraviolet radiation is discontinued, such a photochromic compound will return to its original color or colorless state.Various classes of photochromic compounds have been synthesized and suggested for use in applications in which a sunlight-induced reversible color change or darkening is desired. U.S. Patent 3,567,605 (Becker) describes a series of pyran derivatives, including certain benzopyrans and naphthopyrans. These compounds are described as derivatives of chromene and are reported to undergo a color change, e.g., from colorless to yellow-orange, on irradiation by ultraviolet light at temperatures below about -30°C. Irradiation of the compounds with visible light or upon raising the temperature to above about 0°C is reported to reverse the coloration to a colorless state.U.S. Patent 5,066,818 describes various 3,3-diaryl-3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyrans as having desirable photochromic properties, i.e., high colorability and acceptable fade, for ophthalmic and other applications. Also disclosed by way of comparative example in the '818 patent are the isomeric 2,2-diaryl-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyrans, which are reported to require unacceptably long periods of time to fade after activation.U.S. Patent 3,627,690 describes photochromic 2,2-di-substituted-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran compositions containing minor amounts of either a base or weak-to-moderate strength acid. The addition of either an acid or base to the naphthopyran composition is reported to increase the fade rate of the colored naphthopyrans, thereby making them useful in eye protection applications such as sunglasses. It is reported therein further that the fade rate of 2H-naphtho-[1,2-b]pyrans without the aforementioned additives ranges from several hours to many days to reach complete reversion. U.S. Patent 4,818,096 discloses a blue coloring photochromic benzo- or naphthopyran having at the position alpha to the oxygen of the pyran ring a phenyl group having a nitrogen containing substituent in the ortho or para positions.WO 95/16215 discloses photochromic 2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyrans with a 5-carboxyl or amido
