<ABSTRACT>
Keratin-containing fibres, in particular human hair, are dyed using dyes of formulae (1) to (6) indicated in claim 1. These dyes make it possible to dye by the trichromatic principle even in dark shades.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for dyeing keratin-containing fibres, in
particular human hair, with cationic dyes.By far the largest proportion of all hair dyeings are carried out, even today, using so-called
"oxidation colours", which involves applying small, colourless precursor molecules to the
hair and reacting them by an oxidation process to form larger, coloured molecules.
Although this produces the most durable ("permanent") colourings, increasing reservations
are being voiced about possible toxicological risks posed not only by the substances used
as starting materials but also by the oxidation intermediate and end products, whose
precise composition is virtually uncontrollable. Further disadvantages are the relatively
complicated use and in particular also the hair damage due to the aggressive chemicals
used.The other, so-called "semipermanent" and "temporary" colourings involve the use of
ready-prepared dyes, primarily uncharged disperse dyes and relatively sparingly
water-soluble acid dyes. Cationic dyes, by contrast, play only a very minor part. As the
terms "semipermanent" and "temporary" indicate, these colourings only have a medium to
poor fastness level. Especially the cationic dyes have a reputation for poor hydrolysis and
light resistance and for uneven colouring of the hair, for example between root and tip
(see: John F. Corbett: The Chemistry of Hair-care Products, JSDC August 1976, p. 290).
In addition, the known cationic dyes have an insufficient build-up; i.e., even if increased
amounts are used, it is impossible to exceed a certain, relatively low, colour strength. For
instance, it is not possible to achieve a deep black coloration with the most important
cationic hair dyes Basic Yellow 57, Basic Red 76, Basic Blue 99, Basic Brown 16 and
Basic Brown 17 which are used in practice. For the same reason it is difficult to tint
relatively dark natural hair with these dyes.It has now been found that surprisingly cationic dyes of the below-indicated formulae
have none of these disadvantages. They can be used to achieve in a very simple way and
under gentle conditions very deep dyeings having excellent light, shampooing and crock 
fastness properties. Owing to their extremely clean shades, they also extend the range of
possible mixed shades considerably, especially in the direction of the increasingly
important brilliant fashion colours.The present invention accordingly provides a process for dyeing keratin-containing fibres,
which comprises treating the fibres with a dye of
