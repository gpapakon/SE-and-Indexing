<ABSTRACT>
A technique for reducing signal degradation and fading within a long optical 
transmission system by minimizing polarization dependent hole-burning ("PDHB") through 

the cyclic stressing of a birefringent optical fiber to modulate the SOP of an optical signal 
launched into the transmission system. This effectively reduces the degree of polarization 

of the launched optical signal, without degrading the noise and dispersion characteristics 

of the signal. The modulation frequency of the SOP is chosen to ensure that the launched 
signal does not remain at a particular SOP long enough to anisotropically saturate any 

optical amplifier employed within the transmission system, and give rise to PDHB.

<DESCRIPTION>
Very long optical fiber transmission paths, such as those employed in
undersea or trans-continental terrestrial lightwave transmission systems which employ
optical amplifier repeaters, are subject to decreased performance due to a host of
impairments that increase as a function of the length of the optical fiber comprising the
transmission path. Typically, in such long optical transmission systems, these impairments
vary with time and cause a random fluctuation in the signal-to-noise ratio ("SNR") of the
transmission path. This random fluctuation contributes to a phenomenon known as signal
fading. Signal fading can result in an increased bit error rate ("BER") for digital signals
transmitted via the optical fiber path. When the SNR of a digital signal within such a
transmission system becomes unacceptably small (resulting in an undesirably high BER),
a signal fade is said to have occurred. Experimental evidence has shown that polarization
dependent effects, induced by the optical fiber itself and/or other optical components (e.g.,
repeaters, amplifiers, etc.) along the transmission path, contribute to signal fading and SNR
fluctuations. In particular, one of these effects has now been identified as polarization
dependent hole-burning ("PDHB"), which is related to the population inversion dynamics
of the optical amplifiers. A discussion of hole-burning is provided by D.W. Douglas, R.A.
Haas, W.F. Krupke, and M.J. Weber in "Spectral and Polarization Hole Burning in
Neodymium Glass Lasers"; IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-19,
No. 11,
November 1983.PDHB reduces gain of the optical amplifiers within the long haul
transmission system for any signal having a state of polarization ("SOP") parallel to that
of the primary optical signal carried by the transmission system. However, the gain
provided by these amplifiers for optical signals that have an SOP orthogonal to that of the
primary signal remains relatively unaffected. In simplified terms, the primary optical
signal produces an anisotropic saturation of the amplifier that is dependent upon the SOP
of the primary optical signal. The anisotropic saturation reduces the level of population
inversion within the amplifier, and results in a lower gain for optical signals having the
same SOP as the primary optical signal. This effectively causes the amplifier to
preferentially enhance noise having an SOP orthogonal to that of the primary signal. This
enhanced noise lowers the SNR of the transmission system and causes an increased BER.
