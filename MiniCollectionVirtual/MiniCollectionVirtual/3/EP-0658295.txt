<ABSTRACT>
A frequency-division-multiplex transmitter for carrying an OFDM signal on a large number of closely-spaced carriers receives the digital data at an input (12), applies coding such as convolutional coding (14), time interleaves (16) the signals, and assembles them frame-by-frame in a matrix (18). The data is converted to parallel form by a shift register (18), frequency interleaved, (24) differentially encoded (26), and quadrature phase modulated (28) on several hundred or more closely-spaced carriers. A first inverse Fast Fourier Transform circuit (30) transforms this information in the frequency domain into the time domain. Instead of being transmitted directly, the resultant signals are then amplitude limited (42) and applied to an FFT (44) to reconvert them to the frequency domain. The phases of the wanted signals are then re-set, and the amplitudes of the signals near the edges of the band reduced, in correction circuits (46). The resultant signals are applied to a second inverse FFT (48) for transmission. The output of the second inverse FFT contains smaller power peaks than the output of the first inverse FFT (30). The output is converted to serial form by a shift register (32), a guard interval added (34), and the resultant converted (36) to analogue form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
transmitting digital data by a frequency division multiplex
using a large number of closely-spaced carriers.Orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM)
signals have been proposed for various applications, of which
the first was digital audio broadcasting (DAB), also known as
digital sound broadcasting (DSB); see Leonard J. Cimini, Jr.,
"Analysis and Simulation of a Digital Mobile Channel Using
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing", IEEE Transactions
on Communications, Vol. COM-33, No.7, July 1985, pages 665 to
675. An OFDM signal consists of a large number of carriers,
closely-spaced in frequency, and each modulated with data.
Typically there will be several hundred or even more carriers.The proposed DAB system involves:
(a) a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for both modulation
and demodulation processes, to overcome frequency
selectivity, using many simultaneous narrowband
carriers,(b) interleaving both in frequency and in time, to
realize the large coding gain in all fixed and mobile
receiving conditions, and(c) coding, comprising for example convolutional coding
in conjunction with a Viterbi maximum-likelihood
decoding algorithm to provide a large coding gain,
and possibly an outer block code concatenated with
the convolutional inner code.Such a signal may be termed a Coded Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplex (COFDM).For further background information concerning the
COFDM proposal, reference may for example be made to:
