<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber
composition suitable for use in tyre treads, and
more particularly to a rubber composition for tyre
treads having improved grip characteristics on icy
roads.The use of spiked tyres is in some countries such as
Japan legally prohibited in order to prevent dust
pollution from spiked tyres. Thus in cold districts
studless tyres need to be used instead of spiked
tyres. As a result of improvements, studless tyres
having grip characteristics close to those of spiked
tyres have been developed and are now used
practically.Hysteresis friction, adhesive friction and digging
friction are known as factors controlling the
friction between a tread rubber and a road which
exerts an influence upon the grip characteristics of
studless tyres. On a road having a very low
coefficient of friction such as an icy road, the
friction due to hysteresis loss in very small, thus 
a large portion of the friction results from
adhesive friction and digging friction.The tread pattern and surface conditions of tread
rubber are important to raise the digging frictional
force. Spiked tyres produce a large digging
frictional force. Attempts to raise the digging
frictional force are made also in studless tyres,
for example, by using an expanded rubber or
incorporating an organic fibre into the tread rubber
so as to increase the unevenness of the tread
surface, and an effect has been achieved. The
unevenness of the tread surface also has the effect
of removing a water film formed between the tread
surface and an icy road, thus raising the adhesive
frictional force. However, this rise of the adhesive
frictional force is an indirect result based on
increasing the actual contact area and, therefore,
there is a limit in raising the adhesive frictional
force since there is a limit in increasing the
actual contact area.The rubber itself exerts an influence upon increase
of adhesive frictional force. Accordingly, it is
also an affective manner, for example, to use a soft
rubber compound so as to increase the contact area 
with the road. For this purpose, it has been
practised to decrease the amount of filler, or to
use butadiene rubber or isoprene rubber which does
not harden even at low temperatures, or to add a
softener to the rubber compound. However,
satisfactory results are not obtained, since it is
not possible to soften the tread rubber to an
extreme from the viewpoints of handling stability
and abrasion resistance.Presently used studless tyres exhibit good
characteristics on a snow covered road
