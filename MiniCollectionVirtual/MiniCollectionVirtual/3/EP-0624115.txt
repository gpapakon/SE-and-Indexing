<DESCRIPTION>
TUMBLE GRINDER WITH SCREEN PORTIONTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to comminution apparatus, and in particular to tub grinders of the type having a receptacle defined by a stationary angled floor and a rotating cylindrical wall. The wall is positioned adjacent to the floor with its axis at right angle to the floor and at a substantial angle away from the vertical. An aperture in the floor leads to a hammer mill or other comminution means.BACKGROUND ARTTub grinders are well known, and are commonly used in applications such as comminuting yard waste, branches, shrubs, stumps, logs, forage crops, wooden pallets, railroad ties, slabwood, paper, cardboard, and many other materials. In such grinders, a hammer mill or other comminution means is located beneath a receptacle, with the hammers rotating about a horizontal axis with the hammers projecting up slightly into the receptacle, through an aperture provided in the stationary bottom of the receptacle. Rotating the wall of the receptacle feeds the material past the area of the hammers. The hammers pull the material through a cylindrical housing, pulverizing it and then shooting it out an exhaust, usually via a simple discharge chute.The receptacles may be mounted with their main axis vertically oriented, in which case they are commonly referred to as tub grinders, or with the main axis at a substantial angle away from the vertical, in which case they may be referred to as tumble grinders.Although hammer mills are commonly used in such, grinders, other comminution apparatus is also common, such as flails or grinding rollers. 

 In any tub or tumble grinder, much of the debris being dumped into the receptacle for processing may already be sufficiently small to not require further comminution. In the case of yard waste, for example, the debris may include a large volume of abrasive aggregate including earth, sand, small stones and other abrasive materials which significantly reduce the life of the hammers or other wearing components of the comminution apparatus. Also, it is frequently desirable to regrind material which has already been through the tumble grinder once. Naturally, a substantial portion of such reprocessed material has already been reduced to a desirable size. However, once debris is dumped into the receptacle, all of it must exit through the hammer mill or other comminution apparatus.Thus, in a conventional grinder, it is common to process much more material through the hammer mill or other comminution apparatus than may really be

CLAIMS
1. Tumble grinding apparatus, comprising: a floor (3) angled away from the horizontal, having an opening therethrough communicating with comminution means (12) , and a cylindrical wall (2) positioned against and generally above said floor with its axis at a right angle thereto to define an angled receptacle (1) for receiving material to be comminuted by said comminution means, said wall being rotatable with respect to said floor about said axis; and means (15) for rotating said cylindrical wall to cause tumbling of said material to be comminuted; characterized by said cylindrical wall having classifying openings (20) therethrough around a substantial portion thereof, whereby material small enough to pass through said classifying openings may fall from said receptacle through said wall instead of being routed to said comminution means.
2. Apparatus as recited in claim 1, further characterized by means (24) positioned beneath said classifying opening portion for catching said material which falls through said classifying openings and for conveying said material away from beneath said classifying openings.
3. Apparatus as recited in claim 2, further characterized by stationary sidewalls (22) positioned on either side of said receptacle opposite said classifying openings, whereby material which is flung out to one side or the other through said classifying openings is stopped and redirected to drop down onto said means for catching and conveying said material from beneath said classifying openings. 


4. Apparatus as recited in claim 1, further characterized by said classifying openings being provided by virtue of a substantially open band around said wall, said substantially open band having a screen (20) mounted therearound, covering said substantially open area.
5. Apparatus as recited in claim 2, further characterized by said classifying openings being provided by virtue of a substantially open band around said wall, said substantially open band having a screen (20) mounted therearound, covering said substantially open area.
6. Apparatus as recited in claim 3, further characterized by said classifying openings being provided by virtue of a substantially open band around said wall, said substantially open band having a screen (20) mounted therearound, covering said substantially open area.
7. Apparatus as recited in claim 4, further characterized by said substantially open band being formed by virtue of upper and lower circumferential channel members (28, 29) on either side of said band, a plurality of spaced-apart bars (30) secured between said channel members, screen material (20) overlaid on the outside of said bars, and clamping plates (32) outside said screen material fastened to at least some of said bars to secure said screen material against said bars.
8. Apparatus as recited in claim 5, further characterized by said substantially open band being formed by virtue of upper and lower circumferential channel members (28, 29) on either side of said band, a plurality of spaced-apart bars (30) secured between said channel members, screen material (20) overlaid on the outside of said bars, and clamping plates (32) outside 


said screen material fastened to at least some of said bars to secure said screen material against said bars.
9. Apparatus as recited in claim 6, further characterized by said substantially open band being formed by virtue of upper and lower circumferential channel members (28, 29) on either side of said band, a plurality of spaced-apart bars (30) secured between said channel members, screen material (20) overlaid on the outside of said bars, and clamping plates (32) outside said screen material fastened to at least some of said bars to secure said screen material against said bars.
10. Apparatus as recited in claim 1, mounted on a trailer (5) , further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
11. Apparatus as recited in claim 2, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
12. Apparatus as recited in claim 3, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
13. Apparatus as recited in claim 4, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement 


between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
14. Apparatus as recited in claim 5, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
15. Apparatus as recited in claim 6, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
16. Apparatus as recited in claim 7, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
17. Apparatus as recited in claim 8, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
18. Apparatus as recited in claim 9, mounted on a trailer (5), further characterized by said receptacle being pivotally mounted on said trailer for movement between an angled operating position and a generally horizontal transportation position.
