<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a class of novel organosilanes which 
are useful, among others, as precursors for coupling agents for improving the 
adhesion of fluoropolymers in coatings, laminates, and composites. Certain 
members of this class also are suitable as the stationary phase in both gas 
and liquid chromatography. Other potential uses for these organosilanes 
include the preparation of high-stability silicone fluids and elastomers. Various organosilicon compounds, including 
fluorine-containing organosilanes, are known. For example, U.S. Patent 
4,031,119 to Ponomarev et al. discloses certain 
perfluoroalkyl(alkoxyphenyl)methyldichlorosilanes, which are made by 
treating a perfluoroalkyl(alkoxy)bromobenzene with magnesium and then 
contacting the resulting perfluoroalkyl(alkoxy)magnesium bromobenzene 
with a trifunctional silane. U.S. Patent 3,328,348 to Sporck discloses polyorganosiloxanes 
containing at least one trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl group. U.S. Patent 2,884,433 to Kohl discloses certain 
trifluoromethylphenylsilanes, which are made by a reaction of the 
corresponding Grignard reagent from trifluoromethylphenyl bromide with 
silicon tetrachloride. EP-A- 414 186 discuses certain fluorinated aliphatic silicon compounds prepared by reacting a chlorosilane with a fluorinated olefin. Organosilicon compounds have great potential both as 
intermediates, because of the hydrolytic instability and reactivity of many 
types of covalent silicon bonds with atoms such as, for example, oxygen in 
compounds containing the Si-O-C group, and halogen other than fluorine, 
and as the final products because of their thermal stability and of low 
chemical reactivity of covalent silicon bonds with atoms such as, for example, 
silicon, carbon belonging to certain organic groups, fluorine, and oxygen in 
compounds containing the Si-O-Si group.  
 According to the present invention, there is now provided a 
class of organosilanes having the following formula (1): 
 
where Rf has a maximum of 18 carbon atoms and is selected from 
(a) perfluoroalkyl groups having more than 4 carbon atoms (b) -[CF2CF(CF3)O]n-CF2-CF2-CF3, where n is an integer 
of at least 1; (c) -CF2-(CF2-O)m-CF3, where m is an integer of at least 2; 
and (d) -CH2-C(CF3)2-CF2-CF2-CF3; 
Ar is a divalent aromatic radical; 
X is selected from (e) methyl; (f) Rf-Ar, where each of Rf and Ar is as defined above; (g) halogen atoms selected from 
chlorine, bromine, and iodine; and (h) alkoxy groups; and 
each of Y and Z independently is selected from
