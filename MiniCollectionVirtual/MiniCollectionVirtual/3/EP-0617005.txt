<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel triarylamine
compound, a production process thereof and an electrophotographic
photoreceptor using the triarylamine compound as
a charge transport material.It is well known that a triarylamine compound is used
as a charge transport material for an electrophotographic
photoreceptor. For example, U.S. Patent 3,180,730 discloses
the use of triphenylamine and substituted products thereof as
a charge transport material and U.S. Patent 3,706,554
discloses the use of a tri-p-tolylamine compound. Also, JP-A-57-195254
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses
the use of various triarylamine compounds in a charge
tarnsport layer of a laminated layer type electrophotographic
photoreceptor and further, JP-A-61-132953 discloses an
electrophotographic photoreceptor using a trisazo pigment and
a triarylamine compound in combination. Also, U.S. Patent
4,946,754 discloses elecrtrophotographic photoreceptors using
a diarylbiphenylamine and various charge generating
materials. Also, recently triarylamine compounds having various
substituents are disclosed, for example, in JP-A-1-280763,

etc.EP-A-0 567 396 which is an intermediate document discloses an
electrophotographic photosensitve member the photosensitive
layer of which contains specific fluorene and triphenylamine
compounds. An electrophotographic apparatus comprising said
layer has a high photosensitivity, good potential stability in
repetitive use and a decreased transfer memory.EP-A-0-608 562 which is also an intermediate document discloses
a photosensitive member having a photosensitive layer
containing oxytitanium phthalocyanine as a charge-generating
material and a charge-transporting material.Most typical triarylamine compounds are triphenylamine
and tri-p-tolylamine and they are effective as a charge
transport material for an electrophotographic photorecpetor.
However, since these compounds have a small molecular weight
and a low melting point, when an electrophotographic
