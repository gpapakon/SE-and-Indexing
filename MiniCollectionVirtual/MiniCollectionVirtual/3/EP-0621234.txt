<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing uniform, agglomerate free, 
submicron/nanosize ceramic powders from a polymeric foam 

comprising metal cations homogeneously incorporated within a 
foam cell structure of the polymeric foam. The polymeric 

foam is heated to remove any solvent, and calcined at a 
temperature of about 400°C to about 1400°C for about 1 

minute to about 96 hours to produce the desired ceramic or 
metal powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing 
uniform, agglomerate-free, submicron/nanosize ceramic 
powders for use as starting powders for high technology 
ceramics. In particular, this invention relates to a 
process for preparing uniform, agglomerate-free, 
submicron/nanosize ceramic powders from a precursor solution 
incorporated into a polymeric foam. The usefulness of many high technology ceramics 
depends upon the characteristics of the ceramic powders used 
as starting powders which are sintered to produce a ceramic 
product. In general, to achieve desirable characteristics 
in the finished products, a ceramic powder should consist of 
particles with a narrow size distribution in the submicron 
range. In addition, to avoid pores larger than the primary 
particle size, the particles should be discreet, rather than 
attached together in agglomerated clusters. Agglomerated 
clusters often produce low-density green ceramics and leave 
numerous large pores after sintering. Finally, it is 
important that the ceramic powder be free of contaminants to 
insure purity of the resulting high technology ceramic. One known method of preparing powder formulations 
used in high technology ceramics involves the calcination of 
a mechanically ground mixture of metal oxides and/or 
carbonates in definite proportions. The milling and 
grinding introduces contaminants from abrasive materials 
which have a detrimental effect on the desirable properties 
and introduce a variance into each batch of powder prepared. 
In addition, the mechanically ground mixture requires 
prolonged calcination at high temperatures which promotes  
 
crystallite coarsening, an undesirable consequence in the 
fabrication of dense fine grain ceramics. U.S. Patent 
3,330,697 teaches a process for preparing lead and alkaline 
earth titanates and niobates from resin intermediates made 
from alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as citric acid, in 
which a hydrated oxide or alkoxide and an alpha-hydroxycarboxylate 
of titanium, niobium, and zirconium is 
mixed with citric acid in a polyhydroxy alcohol which is 
liquid below about 100°C, dissolving therein at least one 
basic one metal compound from the group of oxide, hydroxide, 
carbonate and alkoxide of lead and the alkaline earth 
metals, and calcining the composition to remove the organic 
constituents. The resulting product includes agglomerated 
particles which require grinding after calcination. In 
addition, particle size is very difficult to control by this 
method. Similarly,
