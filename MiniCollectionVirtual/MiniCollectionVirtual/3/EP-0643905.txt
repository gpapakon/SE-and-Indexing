<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to grass cutting appliances. In 
particular a grass cutting appliance in the form of a lawn mower 

comprises a hood (1), a cutting member (7) mounted for rotation in 
a substantially horizontal plane within the hood, a handle (2) for 

controlling directional movement of the appliance during a cutting 
operation, a power source (3) disposed remotely from the cutting 

member and supported from the handle, and a drive line for drivingly 
connecting the power source and the cutting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lawn mowers, and in
particular to rotary lawn mowers having a grass collector
and one or more cutting blades mounted for rotation during
operation about a generally vertical axis. Generally
speaking, there are two main categories of rotary lawn
mower, namely (1) a hover-type rotary lawn mower which,
when operative is supported by a cushion of air, and (2) a
rotary mower which is supported on wheels and which may
include a rear roller for producing a striped effect on a
mown lawn.Mowers falling under category (1) are manually
propelled by a user whereas mowers falling under category
(2) may be either manually propelled by a user or
propelled by a drive-line taken from a power unit
connectable via a clutch to one or more wheels or a roller
system. In the latter case the power unit combines the
functions of driving the rotatable cutting blade(s) and
the mower per se.Mowers falling within either category may be
driven directly or indirectly by either an i/c engine or
an electric motor.A mower falling under category (1) is disclosed in
GB2127665. This lawn mower is an air supported mower
arranged to pick-up and store grass cuttings. As such,
it includes a hood defining a cutting chamber within which
a cutter member is mounted for rotation in a substantially
horizontal plane. A motor drives the cutter member and an
impeller via a drive line whereby the impeller directs air
beneath the hood to support the mower. Movement of the
mower is controlled by a handle. A vacuum or low pressure
chamber is used so that air which is being drawn into the
impeller of the hover machine is drawn therethrough
carrying with it cuttings and debris which are deposited
within the vacuum or low pressure chamber. A removable 
receptacle can be installed for receiving cut grass. The
chamber includes an inlet through which cut grass enters,
and an outlet through which air is drawn by the impeller.A lawn mower according to the present invention
comprises a hood, a cutting chamber formed within the
hood, a cutter member mounted for rotation in a
substantially horizontal plane within the cutting chamber,
a handle for controlling directional movement of the
mower, a power source, a drive line for drivingly
connecting the power source to the cutter member, an
impeller drivingly connected to the power source, and a
grass collector. The grass collector includes a body
mounted on the hood and a removable air-permeable
container for receiving grass disposed within and in
spaced relationship with the collector body to

<CLAIMS>
A rotary lawn mower comprising a hood, a cutting chamber formed within the
hood (1), a cutter member (7) mounted for rotation in a substantially horizontal plane

within the cutting chamber, a handle (2) for controlling directional movement of the
mower, a power source (3), a drive line (5) for drivingly connecting the power source

(3) to the cutter member (7), an impeller (8) drivingly connected to the power source
(3),and

a grass collector (10) including a body mounted on the hood and a removable
air- permeable container (16) for receiving cut grass disposed within and in spaced

relationship with the collector body to define a space therebetween, the grass collector
body including an inlet (12) communicating with the container through which cut grass

enters the container (16), and an outlet (13) through which air may be drawn through
the container (16) by the impeller (8), the said space between the collector body and the

container (16) forming a passage for leading air exiting the container (16) to the outlet
(13).
A lawn mower according to claim 1, wherein the removable air-permeable
container (16) is a bag.
A lawn mower according to either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the grass
collector body is mounted on the hood (1), substantially within the circumferential

extent of the hood (1). 
A lawn mower according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the inlet
(12) to the grass collector body is, in use, disposed behind the hood (1) directed towards

the ground.
A lawn mower according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the grass
collector (10) includes an opening, closeable with a lid (14), through which the

removable air-permeable container (16) is removable and insertable.
A lawn mower according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the grass
collector body includes a second inlet (19), and a suction hose (18) attachable thereto

for suction collection of debris therethrough.
A lawn mower according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
removable container (16) is a disposable unit and includes means sealingly co-operable

with the grass collector body inlet.
A lawn mower according to claim 7, wherein the sealing means includes a
hollow cone attached to the removable container, and wherein the collector body inlet

has a conical shape of similar configuration to that of the hollow cone for sealingly cooperating
therewith. 
A lawn mower according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein cut grass
entrained in a stream of air created by the impeller (8) is collected in the container (16),

and air substantially free of cut grass passes through the impeller (8).
A lawn mower according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the grass
collector body is removable from the hood (1).
