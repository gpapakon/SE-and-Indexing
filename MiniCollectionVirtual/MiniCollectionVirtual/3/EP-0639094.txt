Word assembling set useful for conveying messages with which words may be preferably assembled from individual letters provided each with at least one fastening element (1) on its reverse side. The letters may be secured with their fastening element on a flat support. Alternatively, each letter is made of two identical parts (4, 4') which may be laid upon each other. One of the parts has at least one fastening element on its inner side. Both parts have inner teeth (6) and are connected by a spring element (5).
