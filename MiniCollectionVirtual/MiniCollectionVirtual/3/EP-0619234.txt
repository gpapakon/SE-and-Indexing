<ABSTRACT>
A plastic container has a pivotable handle (13) which is connected to said container by means of strip hinges (17) on two diametrically opposite carrying projections (14). Each of the carrying projections (14) is designed as a U-shaped, outwardly projecting web with two vertical bars (15a, 15b) connected by a bend (16), to whose horizontal part the strip hinge (17), designed as a strip-like flexible intermediate piece, is attached tangentially at the bottom. When the handle (13) is pivoted upwards, it rests against the outside of the bend (16) and the adjacent bar (15b). The container comprises a bin which is surrounded below the upper edge of its side wall by a reinforcing ring (7) which is injection-moulded integrally from plastic, is snapped releasably onto the bin (1), and onto which the handle (13) is formed.

Receptacle having a plastics vessel exhibiting a 
base (2) and a circumferential side wall (3), provided 

with a hoop-handle (13), which is formed 
onto the receptacle at two anchorage points, by 

means of a strap hinge (17), which is configured 
as a band-like, flexible intermediate piece and 

attaches respectively along a line parallel to the 
swivel axis, respectively to a carrying extension 

(14) on the outer side of the receptacle, in such 
a way that it is pivotable about a swivel axis 

connecting the anchorage points, characterized in 
that the carrying extension (14) exhibits a strip-shaped 

supporting face, which, at the attachment 

point of the strap hinge (17), runs approximately 
parallel to the latter and, further on, is bent 

off upwards. 
Receptacle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the carrying extension (14) is configured as 

a stay which is bent into a U-shape and to whose 
underside there attaches the strap hinge (17). 
Receptacle according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the strap hinge (17), at the 

attachment point, runs approximately horizontally.  
 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that on the outer side of the 

receptacle, beside the carrying extension (14), a 
retaining cam (18) is fitted in such a way that 

the hoop-handle (13) is held between the carrying 
extension (14) and the retaining cam (18) in an 

approximately upright position. 
Receptacle according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the retaining cam (18) forms a ramp (20) 

which rises outwards, in the peripheral direction, 
up towards the carrying extension (14). 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the side wall (3) has an 

approximately perpendicular or slightly outward-leaning 
inclination and the receptacle comprises a 

reinforcing ring (7), which, surrounding the side 
wall (3), is fitted removably to the vessel, and 

in that the hoop-handle (13) is formed onto the 
reinforcing ring (7). 
Receptacle according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the reinforcing ring (7) is fixed or clamped 

to the vessel by a snap fastening. 
Receptacle according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the reinforcing ring (7) 

comprises a circumferential collar (9), which 
bears at least in places against the outer face of 

the side wall (3). 
Receptacle according to Claims 7 and 8, characterized 
in that the collar (9) exhibits, on its 

inner side, a plurality of flat projections (22), 
which engage in a circumferential indentation (6) 

on the outer wall of the vessel.  
 
Receptacle according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized 
in that the collar (9) bears at least one 

outwardly protruding, circumferential stabilizing 
ring (10; 10a, 10b). 
Receptacle according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the outer rim of the at least one stabilizing 

ring (10; 10b) is adjoined by a downwardly 
pointing, circumferential apron (11). 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 6 to 11, 
characterized in that the upper rim of the side 

wall (3) exhibits a circumferential, outwardly 
pointing lip (4) and the reinforcing ring (7) is 

disposed beneath the lip (4) and abuts against the 
said lip. 
Receptacle according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the reinforcing ring (7) exhibits a plurality 

of upwardly pointing spacers (21) distributed over 
its periphery, which spacers bear respectively, 

with their upper end, against the underside of the 
lip (4). 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 6 to 13, 
characterized in that the reinforcing ring (7) 

bears a plurality of downwardly projecting 
stacking fins (23) distributed over its periphery. 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 6 to 14, 
characterized in that at least the outer side of 

the side wall (3) of the vessel is covered by a 
plastics-film outer casing (32), which is 

situated, at its upper part, within the 
reinforcing ring (7). 
Receptacle according to one of Claims 6 to 15, 
characterized in that at least the inner face of  

 
the vessel is covered by a plastics inner casing 

(32''), which extends beyond its rim onto the outer 
side of the side wall (3) and is clamped there 

between the said side wall and the reinforcing 
ring (7).
