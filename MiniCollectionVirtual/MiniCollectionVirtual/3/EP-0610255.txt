<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for coating a pattern of spaced discrete patches (12) on a web (14) of material includes an extrusion die (18) and a metering pump (20) which supplies coating fluid to the extrusion die (18) from a fluid reservoir (24). A valve (26) directs fluid to either the extrusion die (18) or the fluid reservoir (24) and a piston provides a pulsed flow of fluid to the extrusion die (18). A controller, including a digital preset counter, controls the length of the coated portions of the web (14), the distance between the coated portions of the web (14), and the timing of the valve (26) with respect to the operation of the piston (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coating 
apparatus. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to coating apparatus which can be used to coat 
spaced portions of a substrate. 
Such an apparatus is known from document US-A-3 595 204. Coating a fluid solution onto a web of 
material is well known. It is also known to coat a 
fluid onto a web in a series of discrete patches. In 
one well known system, a gravure coating process using 
a roll coater can be used. However, while this 
produces clean front and rear patch edges, the cell 
pattern is visible in the overall appearance, causing 
the patch to be optically unclear which is 
undesirable. In document US-A-3,973,961, photoconductor 
patches are coated onto carrier webs. A main pump 
provides the major supply of fluid to the die and 
recycle line. Excess flow is supplied to the die to 
obtain transversely uniform flow of fluid through the 
die to the web. Two dosing pumps, one upstream and 
the other downstream of the die, complement the main 
pump by adding controlled oversupply and retraction of 
fluid in the die for starts and stops, respectively, 
of the coating process. However, with this system, 
nonuniform light areas of coating occur on the front 
and back portions of the coated patch. Moreover, the 
coating weight increases over the front portion of the 
patch before decreasing toward the back portion of the 
patch. These unacceptable variations require 
additional complex control equipment. US-A-4,938,994 and a promotional 
brochure entitled "Inca - 2000 Patch Coater" disclose 
an apparatus for patch coating incremental substrates. 
The substrate speed can range from 0.30 - 7.62 m/min  
 
(1 - 25 ft/min). During operation, the coating fluid 
is fed through applicator lips without continuously 
circulating. The present invention overcomes the 
nonuniformity problems of known patch coating systems 
and coats a pattern of plural uniform spaced discrete 
coating patches on a single web of material. The 
apparatus includes an extrusion die, a metering pump 
which supplies coating fluid to the extrusion die from 
a fluid reservoir, and a three-way, high speed spool 
valve which directs fluid to either the extrusion die 
or the fluid reservoir. The coating fluid is 
continuously being transported from the reservoir to 
the valve which directs coating fluid to the die when 
patches are being coated and directs coating fluid 
back to the reservoir in between the coating of 
patches. A piston moves toward the solution to force 
the solution

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for coating a pattern 
of spaced discrete patches (12) on a web (14) comprising:
 
   an extrusion die (18) capable of producing 

uniform thin coatings;
 
   a metering pump (20) which supplies coating 

fluid to the extrusion die (18);
 
   means for directing coating fluid to either 

the extrusion die (18) or a fluid reservoir (24);
 
   characterized by
 
   means adapted to provide a controlled excess flow 

of coating fluid to the extrusion die (18) to provide 
clean front edges (30) of the patches (12) and to quickly 

establish the coating bead;
 
   means adapted to provide a sharp break in the 

coating fluid flowing through the extrusion die (18) to 
provide clean rear edges (32) of the patches (12) to 

quickly end the coating bead; and
 
   means adapted to control the operation of the 

directing means and the two providing means to control 
the length of and the distance between the coated 

patches (12) and to coordinate the timing of the 
directing means with respect to the operation of the 

two providing means. 
The apparatus (10) of claim 1 further 
comprising a reservoir (24) which supplies coating fluid 

through the metering pump (20), and wherein the 
directing means comprises a three-way, high speed 

spool valve (26), and wherein coating fluid is 
constantly being transported from the reservoir (24) to 

the valve (26) which directs coating fluid to the die (18) 
when patches (12) are being coated and directs coating 

fluid back to the reservoir (24) in between the coating 
of patches (12).  

 
The apparatus (10) of claim 1 wherein 
both providing means comprise a single piston (28) 

slidably disposed within a cylinder (34), wherein the 
piston (28) provides a controlled excess flow of coating 

fluid to the extrusion die (18) by moving toward the 
coating fluid to force the coating fluid toward and 

through the extrusion die (18), and wherein the piston 
(28) provides a sharp break in the coating fluid flowing 

through the extrusion die (18) by moving away from the 
coating fluid to pull coating fluid into the piston 

cylinder (34) to suck coating fluid backward into the 
die (18). 
The apparatus (10) of claim 3 wherein the 
controlling means comprises a start counter (40) which 

regulates the starting of coating, an end counter (42) 
which regulates the ending of coating, and means for 

starting the start counter (40) to begin operation, 
wherein each counter (40, 42) is adjustable to 

independently regulate the operation of both the 
directing means and the piston (28), and wherein the 

controlling means can cause the movement of the piston 
(28) to precede, follow, or occur simultaneously with 

the switching of the directing means, and wherein the 
relative timing of operation between the directing 

means and the piston (28) is selected in combination 
with the various properties and conditions of coating. 
A method of coating a pattern of a 
plurality of spaced discrete coating patches (12) on a 

single web (14) of material comprising the steps of:

an extrusion die (18) at intervals corresponding to when 
coating is desired;
