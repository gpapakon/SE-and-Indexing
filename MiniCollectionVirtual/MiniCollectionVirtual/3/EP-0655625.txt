<ABSTRACT>
Sensing elements, useful in sensing the concentration of a gas, e.g., 
carbon dioxide, in a medium, e.g. blood, and methods for making such 

sensing elements are disclosed. In one embodiment, the method comprises 
continuously placing a sensing composition precursor in contact with a 

continuous web, forming a continuous sensing composition from the precursor, 
and applying a continuous opaque film to the sensing composition. A plurality 

of individual sensing elements are formed from this composite structure. 
These sensing elements, which each have very similar sensing characteristics, 

are placed in a sensor fixture for use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to sensing elements useful in sensing an
analyte of interest, and to methods for making such sensing elements. More
particularly, the invention relates to sensing elements and to methods for "mass
producing" sensing elements, for example, useful in sensing the concentration
of a gas, such as, carbon dioxide or oxygen, in an aqueous medium,
for example, blood.In many situations, it is useful to determine the concentration, e.g.
partial pressure, of a gas in a medium, e.g., a fluid medium. One such
situation is the determination of the concentration of gas, e.g., carbon dioxide
or oxygen, in blood. Fluorescence-based sensors have been utilized
to accomplish real time blood gas sensing. For example, fluorescence-based
sensors can be used in an extracorporeal blood loop as shown in Cooper U.S.
Patent No. 4,640,820 and invivo as disclosed in Lubbers et al., Reissue U.S. Patent
No. 31,879.EP-A-0 448 052 discloses a method for making a sensing element, and an
assembled sensing element, useful in sensing the concentration of a gas, such as
carbon dioxide, in a medium such as blood. In one embodiment, the method
includes the steps of placing a quantity of a sensing composition precursor
between and in contact with a transparent, gas impermeable solid disc and an
opaque, gas permeable film. The sensing composition precursor comprises a
sensing component, a polymer precursor and a cross-linking agent.WO 92/15880 refers to a process for manufacturing a self-supporting material for
a test field. In the process, a reagent film material is pressed from an application
side into a web carrier material, which consists of an open-pored composite fiber
structure, so that it thoroughly penetrates the pores of the carrier material. The
reagent film material is spread smoothly over the opposite side by the relative
motion of the web and a smoothing tool, so that the pores of the fibrous composite
structure are covered over by the reagent film material. Finally, the web of test
field material is dried essentially free of contact.Yafuso et al., U.S. Patent 4,824,789 disclose a sensing composition
and sensor useful for determining the concentration of a gas in blood. This
patent discloses a sensing composition which is useful when placed on the
optical surface of an optical fiber to form a sensor. The sensing composition
comprises an aqueous first phase dispersed in a cross-linked polymeric second
phase. The aqueous first phase includes a dye, for example a pH sensitive
dye. The cross-linked polymeric
