<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is based on the surprising discovery 
that undenatured whey protein concentrate has an enhanced 
immunological effect. More specifically, this invention relates 
to the effect of the oral administration of undenatured whey 
protein concentrate (WPC) on host resistance to the development 
of chemically induced cancer and also the effect of such oral 
administration on the inhibition of cancer. In U.S. Applications SN 298,971 and SN 417,246, and also in 
Bounous et al "Dietary Whey Protein Inhibits the Development of 
Dimethyl-hydrazine induced Malignancy" (1) we described 
experiments showing that continuous feeding of WPC in the diet 
inhibits the development (number and size of tumours) in the 
colon of a mouse over a period of 24 weeks of dimethylhydrazine 
(DMH) treatment. This anti-tumour effect could be caused by 
increased resistance of target cells to the carcinogen and/or a 
direct inhibitory effect of WPC on the cancer cells. A 
subsequent series of experiments (2) where animals were fed 
Purina diet for the first 20 weeks of DMH and then switched to 
WPC diet for the remaining 8 weeks of DMH treatment, suggested 
some inhibitory effect of WPC feeding on cancer cells. Most recently (3) a group of French scientists confirmed in 
vitro a direct inhibitory effect of WPC on human cancer cells. 
Indeed similar studies in vitro with human breast cancer cells 
have shown that bovine serum albumin (BSA) is the factor exerting 
inhibition of cancer cell replication (4).  
 We have also shown that this activity of WPC is specifically 
dependent upon the glutamylcysteine groups (substrate for GSH 
synthesis) present in the BSA fraction of WPC (U.S. Serial Number 
563,794). Interestingly, the introduction of the cysteine 
delivery system ozothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ) 
(ozothiazolidine-4-carboxylate), while enhancing glutathione 
(GSH) levels in normal cells, was found to result in feedback 
inhibition of the GSH cycle in human tumour cells (5). This 
differential effect of OTZ was recently confirmed in vivo (6). 
The previously described direct inhibitory effect of WPC (3) and 
more specifically of BSA (4) could be explained therefore by the 
release during incubation of a potent cysteine delivery system 
such as glutamylcysteine. 
We have therefore reached the following conclusions: 
1) BSA is the protein fraction of WPC that we found to be 
primarily responsible for the GSH promoting activity of WPC. 
This activity which we believe to be the basis for the immuno 
enhancing and
