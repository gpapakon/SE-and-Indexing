<DESCRIPTION>
DE-A-14 91 042 discloses a process for manufacturing a dental prosthesis, whereby a
dental material is used comprising a refractory oxide and a glass-forming material.EP-A-0 518 454 discloses a process of making a composite material suitable for
overcoating a dental crown or a bridge containing a glass powder and 10-60% by
weight ZrO2.The invention relates to a
process for manufacturing a non-metallic
dental prosthesis. In
particular, the invention provides dental prostheses of
high strength. Dental prostheses prepared according to
the present invention include caps, crowns, bridges,
veneers, inlays and onlays, for example, peripheral caps
and crowns, bridges that are placed on stumps of natural
teeth to support simultaneously the remaining parts of at
least two teeth by compensating ultimately for one or more
missing teeth. To produce supporting metal structure
parts for dental prostheses, such as caps and frames,
metal is used for its high strength, but for esthetic
reasons, it is coated with a dental ceramic or acrylic
veneering material to provide the form, color and contour
of the dentition. The metal structure is frequently cast
into a mold prepared from an inorganic investment
material, but it may be formed by other methods such as
computer assisted design and machining. Most often cast metal structure is veneered with a
dental ceramic or with acrylics that gives the prostheses
the shape and the shade of natural teeth. The veneer
material must be very opaque in order to cover the metal
structure of the prosthesis which provides an undesirable
appearance. Prior prostheses are not entirely biocompatible
as corrosion of the metal therein causes them 
to discolor and inflame adjacent gum tissue, which may
also recede. Still another disadvantage is corrosion or
solution effects of metal causes discoloration of the
veneer or adjacent soft tissue.A disadvantage of the prior art metal supported
ceramic structures is that the metal often appears as a
visible dark border at the boundary of the prosthesis in
contact with the gingiva. The metal substructures are not
generally completely veneered with ceramic or acrylic in
this area in order to utilize the greater edge strength of
metals, as well as to protect the gum against damages
caused by thick margins, and as a consequence a metallic
colored ring at the margin of the restoration results in
less than optimal esthetic results. Another disadvantage
of prosthesis which have a metal substructure is that,
while the highly opaque thin coating of ceramic or
