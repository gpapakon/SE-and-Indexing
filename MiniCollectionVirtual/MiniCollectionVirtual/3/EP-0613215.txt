<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a right-angled (elbowed) coaxial connector element of the type possessing a substantially parallelepipedal conducting body and at least one right-angled conducting rod, one end of which is connected to a pin projecting from one of the faces of the said body and the other end of which is connected to the central conductor of a coaxial contact, projecting from another face of the said body and perpendicular to the pin, the right-angled conducting rod being held in place by an insulator inside a L-shaped internal conduit made in the body. The said insulator (18, 19) has a sectional narrowing defining an air layer (18', 19') around at least part of the straight branch of the said rod (8, 9).

A right angled coaxial connector element (1) of the 
type comprising a generally parallelepipedal conductive body 

(5), at least one right angled conducting rod (8,9), of 
which one end is connected to a pin (10,11) projecting from 

one of the faces of said body and of which the other end is 
connected to the central conductor (12,13) of a coaxial plug 

(14,15) projecting from another face of said body and 
perpendicular to the pin (10,11), the right angled 

conducting rod (8,9) being held by an insulator (18,19) 
within an L-shaped internal channel formed in the body, 

characterized by the fact that said insulator (18,19) 
includes a narrowing in cross section defining an air 

cushion (18',19') around at least part of the rectilinear 
arm of said rod (8,9). 
A right angled coaxial connector element according to 
claim 1, characterized by the fact that said insulator 

(18,19) comprises, in the neighbourhood of the right angled 
part of the conducting rod (8,9), surfaces (18a,19a) in 

contact with the inner wall of the L-shaped internal channel 
(6,7). 
A right angled coaxial connector element according to 
claim 1 or claim 2, characterized by the fact that said 

conductor (18,19) comprises, at the ends of the right angled 
conducting rod (8,9), surfaces (18b,19b; 18c,19c) in contact 

on the one hand with the inner wall of the L-shaped internal 
channel (6,7) and on the other hand with the inner wall of 

the external sleeve of the coaxial plug (14,15). 
A right angled coaxial connector element according to 
any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by the fact that it 

comprises push fit connectors (10,11) as pins permitting its 
engagemen
t with a printed circuit board (3).  
 
A right angled coaxial connector element according to 
any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized by the fact that the 

generally parallelepipedal conductive body (5) is formed in 
two parts (22,23) assembled on a plane containing the axes 

of the two arms of the right angled conducting rod (8,9). 
A right angled coaxial connector element according to 
claim 5, characterized by the fact that the two parts 

(22,23) are held together by the riveting of plugs (25) 
integral with one of said parts (23) inside holes (24) 

formed in the other part (22). 
A right angled coaxial connector element according to 
any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized by the fact that it 

comprises a ground plate (21) riveted to the lower wall (5a) 
of the parallelepipedal body (5).
