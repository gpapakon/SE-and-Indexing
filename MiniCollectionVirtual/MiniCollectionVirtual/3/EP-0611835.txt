<ABSTRACT>
An electrolytic cell of horizontal type 
constructed such that the electrolytic cell proper is 

divided horizontally by one or two ion exchange 
membranes. If one ion exchange membrane is used, the 

cell is divided into a cathode and an anode 
compartment holding a gas electrode. If two ion 

exchange membranes are used, the cell is divided into 
a cathode compartment (14), an intermediate compartment (15), 

and an anode compartment (16). This arrangement permits 

the gas electrode (23) and the current collector (22) to be in 
contact with each other under a uniform pressure, and 

also allows for smooth gas discharge. This leads to 
a reduction in the electrolytic potential of the cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrolytic 
cell and a method of electrolysis by the same for the 
production of an alkali and an inorganic acid (or 
organic acid) from a salt of an inorganic acid (or 
organic acid). More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an electrolytic cell and a method 
of electrolysis by the same for the production of 
caustic soda and hydrochloric acid from sodium 
chloride, the production of an alkali and sulfuric 
acid from sodium sulfate, and the production of an 
alkali and amino acid from a salt of an amino acid. A branch of the old basic chemical industry is 
electrolysis for the production of sodium hydroxide 
and chlorine from an aqueous solution of alkali 
chloride, especially brine. Electrolysis in the early 
stage, which employed mercury as the cathode, yielded 
alkali hydroxide and chlorine of extremely high 
purity. However, the use of this conventional method 
is now restricted because of large energy consumption 
(approximately 3000 kWh/ton-alkali hydroxide) and 
environmental pollution due to mercury. The  
 
conventional method has been replaced by a new one 
which employs an asbestos diaphragm. However, it has 
the disadvantage of yielding low-purity alkali 
hydroxide which needs subsequent separation from 
alkali chloride and also yielding chlorine containing 
a large amount of oxygen. In addition, its energy 
consumption including that for product purification is 
equal to or larger than that of the mercury method, 
although it requires a small amount of energy for 
electrolysis itself. Moreover, it poses a problem 
associated with the production of cancer by asbestos. 
At present, the method for electrolysis of alkali 
chloride has been shifted to the ion exchange membrane 
method. The ion exchange membrane consists of feeding a 
purified aqueous solution of alkali chloride 
(especially brine) to the anode compartment of the 
electrolytic cell (which is divided into the anode and 
cathode compartments by a cation exchange membrane) 
and pure water (if necessary) to the cathode 
compartment, thereby producing chlorine in the anode 
compartment and alkali hydroxide (30-50%) in the 
cathode compartment. This method consumes 20-30% less 
energy than the conventional method (2200-2500 
kWh/ton-alkali hydroxide). This method is used for 
the production of more than 80% of alkali hydroxide in  
 
Japan. In addition, this method is also used for 
electrolysis of other alkali compounds such as sodium 
sulfate. The present inventors have proposed a
