<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording medium capable of providing 
recorded images of excellent water resistance which 

is obtained by coating on a support a mixture of 100 
parts by weight of a water-soluble polymer and 0.1-30 

parts by weight of a crosslinking agent such as an epoxy 
or triazine crosslinking agent, said water-soluble 

polymer being obtained by copolymerizing 10-50 parts by 
weight of a quaternary salt monomer selected from trimethyl-3-(acryloylamino)propylammonium 

chloride, 
trimethyl-2-(methacryloyloxy)ethylammonium chloride, 

etc., 1-30 parts by weight of an amino group-containing 
monomer selected from dimethylaminopropylacrylamide, 

dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, etc. or a carboxyl 
group-containing monomer selected from acrylic acid, 

methacrylic acid, etc., and 20-80 parts by weight of a 
monomer selected from acrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl 

(meth)acrylate, N-vinylpyrrolidone, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet 
recording medium to which an aqueous ink is applied for 
carrying out recording. More particularly, it relates 
to a recording medium which is suitable for use to carry 
out color image recording thereon with an aqueous ink 
and which comprises a paper, a resin coated paper or a 
film as a support. The ink jet recording method performs 
recording of letters or images by allowing ink droplets 
ejected by various working principles on a recording 
medium. Ink jet printers have such favorable features 
that there is no limitation as to kind of recording 
patterns, that they can easily perform multi-color 
recording and that the maintenance thereof is easy. 
Therefore, the ink jet printers are rapidly becoming 
widespread as devices for producing hard copies of image 
information. The image information recorded on ink jet 
recording media which comprise a transparent film as a 
support is utilized as originals for presentation in 
conferences, lecture meetings, etc. by using overhead 
projectors together with photographic slides. Recording  
 
of image information by ink jet recording method for 
overhead projectors provides many merits. As for the recording media used for ink jet 
recording, efforts have been made from the aspects of 
printer hardwares or ink composition in order to use 
woodfree papers or coated papers used for ordinary 
printing or writing. However, improvements in recording 
media have come to be required increasingly in order to 
go side by side with developments in printer hardwares 
such as ever increasing speed, development of ever finer 
definition and images of full color. That is, for 
recording media, it is required that image density of 
the printed ink dots be high and hue characteristics be 
bright and appealing, the ink absorbing capacity be 
great and the ink absorbing speed be high and as a 
result, the ink applied do not bleed or spread even 
though different color inks are put over additionally. 
Moreover, the circumference of dots should be sharp and 
demarcating. In order to meet these requirements, many 
proposals have been made. For example, Japanese Patent 
Kokai No.53-49113 discloses an ink jet recording sheet 
containing urea-formaldehyde resin powder and 
impregnated with a water-soluble polymer, but the ink 
jet recording sheets of this type suffer from the 
problems that the circumference of dots is apt to get 
blurred and besides, density of dots is low. Further, Japanese Patent Kokai No.55-5830 
discloses an ink
