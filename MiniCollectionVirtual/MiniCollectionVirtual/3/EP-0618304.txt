<ABSTRACT>
Nitrided stainless steel comprises austenitic stainless steel 
wherein a portion of the surface layer at least is composed of a 

nitrided hard layer which 

(A) contains substantially no crystalline chrome nitride; 
(B) contains N atoms at 2 to 12% by weight in the base phase 
austenitic stainless steel phase of base phase. 
Such nitrided stainless steel has excellent anti-corrosion 
properties and surface hardness. There is no dimensional change or 

surface roughness caused by deposition of crystalline chrome 
nitride, and so no final finishing process is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nitrided stainless steel
products superior both in anti-corrosion property and surface
hardness.Generally, austenitic stainless steel products such as
screws have been widely employed because of their superiority
in not only corrosion resistance, but also toughness,
workability, heat resistance and non-magnetic property and the
like. However, although austenitic stainless steel products
have excellent anti-corrosion property, as mentioned above,
they do not have quenching hardenability so that they are not
suitable for such usage as requires high surface hardness.Among stainless steel materials, martensitic stainless
steel containing chrome at 13 to 18% (by weight; the same
applies hereinafter) have been also employed besides the above
austenitic stainless steel. This martensitic stainless steel
has quenching hardenability, however, it is greatly inferior
in its corrosion resistance property to austenitic stainless
steel. Therefore, this material cannot be applied to the
such usage as requires corrosion resistance. On the other
hand, from the viewpoint that the above austenitic stainless
steel lacks surface hardness, hard chrome plating and the 
like has been applied in order to improve the deficiency.
However, there is a problem practically in the above plating
because the adhesion of the plating coat is low thereto.Recently, corrosion resistance of stainless steel has
been focused on. It has been increasingly demanded to
maintain this corrosion resistance and at the same time to
improve its surface hardness. For this purpose,
it has been attempted to apply nitriding treatment
to austenitic stainless steel superior in corrosion resistance
(18-8 stainless steel containing 18% chrome and 8% nickel has
been widely employed) and to form a nitrided hard layer so as
to improve its surface hardness.As a method of nitriding treatment, a variety of methods
such as salt bath nitriding treatment, ion-nitriding treatment,
gas nitriding and the like are available. Nitriding
temperature is usually set around 550 to 570 °C, and around
480°C at the lowest in these nitriding treatments. As
results of nitriding screws made of austenitic stainless steel
by such nitriding methods, in spite that the surface hardness
has been improved, original property of corrosion resistance
for stainless steel deteriorates so that a defect of easily
rusting has been caused.It has been desired to
provide stainless steel products which have both high 
anti-corrosion property and superior surface hardness.The base
