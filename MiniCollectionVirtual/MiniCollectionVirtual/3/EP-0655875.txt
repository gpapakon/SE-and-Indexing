<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adaptor for upgrading ISDN telephones having an existing interface for ancillary equipment (AEI interface).   The object of the invention of developing an adaptor of the generic type, by means of which analog terminals can be connected to the ISDN in an inexpensive manner and which can be used both in the pulse dialling type of signalling and in the multifrequency dialling type of signalling is achieved by the fact that the analog a/b interface 3 is converted to the analog section of the AEI interface 6.1, and conversely.
