<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic Doppler blood flow meter apparatus
includes a wall filter (20) for eliminating clutters from an

echo signal of an ultrasonic pulse signal sent to a living
being under test. The wall filter (20) includes a switch

(24) for cutting a part of input data and a control unit (30)
for controlling the switch (24) such that the switch is

opened during a period in which first 
m
 data (where 
m
 is
integer) is inputted to undergo filtering by the wall filter

while the switch (24) is closed during a period in which data
following the (m+1)-th data inclusive thereof are inputted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
Doppler blood flow meter apparatus for measuring blood flows
in living beings by utilizing an ultrasonic Doppler method
in the medical field for thereby generating blood flow
images.There is known a two-dimensional ultrasonic
Doppler blood flow meter apparatus in which a blood flow
distribution in a living being is determined by making use
of an ultrasonic Doppler's effect and displayed in
superposition on a two-dimensional monochromatic tomograph
with the blood flow distribution being displayed in a color.
This apparatus is also known as a color flow apparatus. A
structure of the two-dimensional Doppler blood flow meter
apparatus known heretofore is shown in Fig. 7.Referring to Fig. 7, an ultrasonic transmitter 1
emits ultrasonic pulses through the medium of a probe 2 for
irradiation of a portion of a living being. Echoes generated
as the result of irradiation with the ultrasonic pulses are
converted into an electric signal through the probe 2, which
signal is then amplified by a receiver 3 and undergoes phase
shift detection by a phase shift detector 4 to be thereby
converted to a Doppler shift signal. The Doppler shift
signal outputted from the phase shift detector 4 is
converted into digital data through an analogue-to-digital 
(A/D) converter 5, the digital data being then inputted to
a wall filter 6 which is generally constituted by a finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) type
filter of degree several and which serves for
eliminating unwanted signal components of low frequencies
(usually referred to as the clutter) which originate in
intravital tissues. Fig. 6 shows, by way of example, a major
portion of the wall filter constituted by an IIR-type filter
of second degree or order. The wall filter 6 of this
configuration features that characteristic equivalent to
that of the FIR-type filter can be realized by using a
smaller number of multipliers and adders when compared with
the FIR-type filter and that the cut-off characteristic can
flexibly be modified by changing the feedback coefficients
K1 and K2. The Doppler shift signal from which the clutters
are eliminated by the wall filter 6 is supplied to a blood
flow rate arithmetic unit 7 which is adapted to determine
arithmetically the blood flow rates. The output of the blood
flow rate arithmetic unit 7 is then inputted to a digital
scan converter (hereinafter referred to as the DSC in
abbreviation) 9 together with a B-mode signal outputted from
an envelope detector 8. In the
