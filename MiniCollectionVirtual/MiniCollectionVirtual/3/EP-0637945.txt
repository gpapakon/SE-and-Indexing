<ABSTRACT>
An orthodontic band (10B) having a textured inner surface (12) for enhancing the adhesive bonding to a tooth, wherein the textured surface is formed by photoetching a pattern (11, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28) of pockets, indentations, or raised portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to an orthodontic
band, and more particularly to an orthodontic band having a
textured inner surface for enhancing the strength of cement
bonding the band to a tooth, and still more particularly to
an orthodontic band having a textured inner surface where
the textured surface is formed by photoetching a pattern of
pockets, recesses, or raised dots on the surface.Orthodontic bands serve an important function during
the orthodontic treating of a patient to correct malocclusions.
Such bands may be applied to all of the teeth or
only to anchor teeth in accordance with the particular
technique preferred by the orthodontist. Importantly, the
bands reduce tendencies for carious attack on the tooth due
to their circumferential protection of the enamel.
Additionally, they are important in that they allow secure
attachment of various brackets or tubes to the teeth that
facilitate orthodontic biomechanics. Finally, the bands
serve to more evenly distribute a tooth-moving force over
the area of an individual tooth.The use of orthodontic bands has always been common
to the profession of orthodontics either through manual
"pinching" of bands or the more modern seamless ring-shaped
bands. Another historic problem has been associated with
their benefits in that the cement or adhesive seal between
the inner band surface and the luting medium tends to loosen
and allow dislodging of the band. Loose bands may occur
from many different situations such as because of occlusal
forces, extraoral tractive forces, masticatory forces from 
food bolus, or even improper sizing and seating.
Additionally, luting agents may be mixed improperly or
moisture may be introduced into the agents prior to complete
cement setup.Clinically, loosened bands can lead to micro-leakage
of electrolytes or other contaminants which often cannot be
detected through the normal course of orthodontic treatment.
Upon removal of a loose band at the end of treatment, it may
then be discovered that deleterious effects of cement seal
failure have caused decalcification or carious attack of the
tooth surface. Other clinical problems resulting from loose
bands include the frustration-of emergency office visits and
the scheduling of extra appointments to clean the tooth and
re-cement another band for the continuance of orthodontic
treatment. Additionally, there may be a relapse of desired
tooth movement prior to the replacement of a loose or
dislodged band.The present invention is particularly concerned with
the fixing of bands

<CLAIMS>
An orthodontic band (10B) comprising a ring-shaped
body of thin metal foil material having a smooth exterior

side (13) to which an orthodontic appliance may be attached
and characterised by having a textured internal side (12)

for bonding to a tooth, the said internal side comprising a
pattern of photo-etched indentations having undercuts to

improve cement adhesion.
An orthodontic band according to Claim 1, wherein
the indentations are arranged in rows with those in adjacent

rows being aligned.
An orthodontic band according to Claim 1, wherein
the indentations are arranged in rows with those adjacent

rows being staggered.
An orthodontic band according to Claim 2 or Claim 3,
wherein the indentations are generally round.
An orthodontic band according to Claim 2 or Claim 3,
wherein the indentations (28) are generally square.
An orthodontic band according to Claim 5 wherein the
indentations are generally polygonal. 
An orthodontic band according to any preceding claim
in which the indentations in centimetres are about 0.0089 by

0.0089 with a depth of about 0.0025 and a spacing between
pockets of about 0.0127.
An orthodontic band according to any preceding claim
in which each of said indentations has a centrally disposed

island, whereby said indentations coact with cement when
attaching the band to a tooth with a dental cement to

materially enhance the strength of the cement bond between
the band and the tooth.
An orthodontic band according to any preceding
claim, wherein the pattern further includes a multiplicity

of protuberances.
An orthodontic band according to any preceding
claim, wherein the pattern further includes a multiplicity

of raised dots.
An orthodontic band according to any preceding
claim, wherein the pattern includes a multiplicity of

doughnut-shaped recesses. 
An orthodontic band according to any preceding
claim, wherein the band is die-worked from a metal blank

(14) of thin stainless steel, said blank being circularly
shaped and having a thickness of about 0.0152 cm, the outer

side (13) of the blank being smooth and the inner side (12)
being textured, said textured side being photo-etched with a

plurality of rows of indentations that form undercuts after
die-working.
An orthodontic band according to Claim 12, wherein
the indentations are sized in centimetres of about 0.0089 by

0.0089 with a depth of about 0.0025 and a spacing of about
0.0127.
An orthdontic band according to Claim 12, wherein
the indentations are sized in centimetres of about 0.0216 by

0.0216 with a depth of about 0.0025 and a spacing of about
0.0127.
A method of manufacturing orthodontic bands
comprising photo-etching a thin sheet or strip of metal to

form a pattern of pockets or recesses on one side,
characterised by the step of die-working the sheet to form

ring-shaped bodies with the photo-etched pockets or recesses
on the inside, whereby at least some of the pockets or

recesses become distorted to form undercuts which improve
cement adhesion.
