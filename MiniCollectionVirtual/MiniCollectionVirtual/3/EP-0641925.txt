<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to smoke reducing device and method
for reducing smoke which occurs in a diesel engine.A device for controlling the fuel injection timing in the
ignition-advance direction to obtain smooth acceleration
during step-on of the accelerator has been used in diesel
engines (as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application
No.60-201051). In this ignition-advance control technique,
the ignition-advance amount is adjusted so that acceleration
under a condition where a normal load is applied
to an engine (hereinafter referred to as "normal acceleration")
can be smoothly performed. That is, the ignition-advance
amount is mainly adjusted to smoothly perform
the normal acceleration. Accordingly, the ignition-advance
amount is not adjusted for an acceleration (racing) under a
condition where no load is applied to an engine (hereinafter
referred to as "no-load acceleration"), and thus the
ignition amount for the normal acceleration is excessively
large for the no-load acceleration, so that the amount of
smoke which occurs due to the excessive ignition-advance is
increased.Further, there has been known a control technique which is
called exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for returning a part
of exhaust gas to an inlet port of the engine to reduce nitrogen
oxides in the exhaust gas during acceleration. However,
like the ignition-advance control technique, in this
EGR technique the return rate (EGR rate) of the exhaust gas
becomes excessively large under no-load acceleration, 
and thus there also occurs the problem that the amount
smoke is increased.The document EP-278990 discloses a method for controllling
the fuel injection timing in a diesel engine for reducing
fuel consumption or noise immission. When the engine load
changes from a lower load range to a higher load range, the
injection timing is first temporarily retarded and then advanced
to the new timing corresponding to the changed load
condition. This document does not disclose any control
steps for reducing smoke in case of no-load acceleration.An object of this invention is to provide a smoke reducing
device and method for sufficiently suppressing occurrence
of smoke under no-load acceleration in a diesel engine in
which a ignition-advance control or EGR control is performed
to improve acceleration characteristics or exhaust
gas components under acceleration.In order to attain the above object, according to one aspect
of this invention, the smoke reducing device has the
features of claim 1 or claim 6.In the smoke reducing device
