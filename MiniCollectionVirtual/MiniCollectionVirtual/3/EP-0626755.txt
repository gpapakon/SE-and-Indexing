<ABSTRACT>
A leading edge blanking circuit has been provided. The LEB 
circuit (20) includes a minimum number of components for 

monitoring a gate voltage of a transistor (28) and passing a current 
sense signal, which senses the current level through the transistor, 

to subsequent control circuitry (32) when the gate voltage exceeds 
a predetermined threshold (V
LEBTH
). Further, the predetermined 
threshold is chosen to be between the Miller plateau voltage of the 

transistor and the desired maximum gate voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to switching devices and, in particular, 
to a circuit for blanking a current sense signal of the switching 
device when the switching device is transitioning. 
It also relates to the corresponding method. In general, in switching mode power supply (SMPS) 
applications, current through an inductive load is typically sensed 
indirectly by monitoring a current through a power transistor 
wherein the transistor is coupled to the inductive load and the 
inductive load is further coupled to an input supply voltage. This 
sensed current signal through the power transistor is used for 
cycle-by-cycle current limiting and for current mode control. 
However, during the power transistor turn-on transition, a current 
spike occurs due to parasitic capacitances primarily occurring due 
to inductor or transformer interwinding capacitances and power 
transistor output capacitances. It is well known in the art that 
this leading edge current spike must be filtered out to prevent the 
control circuit, which is responsive to the current sense signal, 
from responding to the current spike. One simple solution to this problem is to generate a blanking 
signal that disables the control circuitry for a fixed period of time 
after the power transistor is turned on. However, a problem with 
this solution is that the specific time period of the blanking signal 
must be designed for the worst case current spike pulse width. As 
a result, the duration of the banking signal is typically too long 
for many applications. Another solution to the problem is to use external timing 
elements to optimally set the blanking time for each specific 
application. However, a problem with this solution is that it  
 
increases the integrated circuit's pin count as well as the number of external 
components. Another solution is described in detail in an IEEE conference proceedings 
article on Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC) entitled "A Monolithic 
Boost Converter for Telecom Applications" by F. J. DE Stasi and T. S. Szepesi 
wherein figure 8 shows an adaptive blanking circuit. However, this adaptive 
blanking circuit does not work well under short circuit conditions and further 
the adaptive blanking circuit is quite complex in circuitry. US patent no. 
4,771,357 gives examples of blanking circuitry for blanking a current sense 
signal, in which the gate drive signal serves to bias a current sense comparator. Hence, there exists a need for an improved leading edge blanking circuit 
having minimum circuitry and
