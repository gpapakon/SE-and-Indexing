<ABSTRACT>
The figure shows a highly raised heel with a comparatively thin, narrow underside, of the high heel type (22); an inelastic hard core component as a stabilising component (1) with a straight surface (1c) on the inner surface of the closable cover (9) of the one-piece soft flexible envelope (6) which surrounds the core (4) and is made of a layer of elastic material with high inherent damping coefficient as the damping component. When the heel sole is manufactured separately, the envelope has its maximum no-load thickness at the envelope cover (5a). When the heel sole is manufactured as part of the heel, the envelope has its maximum no-load thickness at the sole (5). The envelope is parallel (21) to the outer faces of the core and extends round all sides of the heel. The heel is attached to the surface (2) of the cover and the outer, higher envelope external wall -- compared to the core height -- by securing the upper surface (22) by a screw, nailing in the hard core (3), the screw being given stability by a hard plastic ring (10). The soft outer envelope is placed or applied by extrusion loosely with no attachment to all the inner envelope walls and is higher than the inelastic core (7a in the no-load state).

A raised shoe heel of high-heel or conical wedge shape,
comprising


a: a core (1), which is matched to the shape of the heel and
which ensures stability of the latter, made of non-elastic non-pliable

hard material; and
b: a downwardly closed spring-elastic one-piece outer envelope
(6) of soft-elastic, rubber-flexible material which encases the

core (1) and is held thereonto in a loose connection in such a
manner that
c: it is in its unloaded state higher than the core (1), and in such
a manner that
d: it is elastically compressible in the direction of the longitudinal
axis of the shoe heel for the purpose of absorbing the setting

down of the shoe wearer's weight.
Shoe heel according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the core
(1) is made of a hard plastic or wood and either solid (12) or

hollow (12a), and the top is either continuously smooth (1c) or at
the side of the edge provided with a gradation (1a, 16, 1b, 16a)

or flattening (1d, 16b),
Shoe heel according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the
top of the core (1) is either of even, convex or concave.
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
that
 the outer envelope (6) encases the core on all sides, and in
particular comprises a cover (9, 9a) which extends over the top

of the core (1).
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
that
 the heel is produced with a cover (9, 9a) which is closed or
closable by means of closure nipples or closure groves.
Shoe heel a ccording to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
that
 the outer sleeve comprises a beading (16, 16a) which 
reaches over the upper edge of the core (1) or a snap closure

(16b).
Shoe heel according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 grooves
(11, 14) are formed on the outer surface of the outer envelope

(6).
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in
that
 it includes a separate heel patch of normal (18) or special
height (18a) which is made of the same material as the outer

envelope and either separately attached to the core by means of
one or more hard plastic pins or sprayed in one spraying process

with the outer sleeve (6).
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in
that
 the outside of the outer envelope (6) is provided with a
stretchable layer of leather or plastic or covered in an elastic

dyed skin or dyed.
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in
that
 the core (1) has at its top predrilled holes for attachment
onto the shaft of an associated shoe and/or predrilled holes at

the bottom for attaching a heel patch (17).
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in
that
 it is an integral part (19, 20) of the sole of the shoe, which is
connectible to the shaft of the shoe, in particular by means of

gluing, foaming (13), nails (13), press studs or screws.
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in
that
 the outer envelope (6) is made of a thermoplastic material,
such as caoutchouk, polyurethane or rubber.
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in
that
 it has a comparably narrow walking surface.
Shoe heel according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in
that
 the wall of the outer envelope (6) is of different strengths, in
particular having its greatest strength at the bottom (5), the top

(5a) or one side (5b).
