<ABSTRACT>
A method for the delivery of medicaments to newly hatched poultry. A vaccine or other medicament is injected into the yolk sac of a newly hatched chick, and is released to the chick's system as the yolk is absorbed by the chick. An injection device is shown having one or optionally a pair of guide services for guiding a chick axially of a hypodermic needle during an injection procedure to reduce damage to the injection site.

<DESCRIPTION>
Domestically raised poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guineas,
pheasants, and quail, are subject to a variety of diseases and infections after hatching.
Some resistance to disease is provided by naturally-occurring antibodies and virus-neutralizing
gamma globulins in the yolk of the egg, which is carried by the chick
immediately beneath the skin of the abdomen. The yolk contents are absorbed into the
digestive tract of the chick over a seven to nine day period after hatching. See, e.g.,
C. R. Parkhurst and G. J. Mountney (1989), Chapter 5, "Incubation and Hatchery
Management," in Poultry Meat and Egg Production, Van Nostrand (New York).Supplementary medications can be administered to poultry by several methods,
including subcutaneous injection and eye drops. Subcutaneous injections commonly
are performed in the necks of newly hatched chicks on an assembly line basis, and
equipment for this purpose is available commercially. In this procedure, the chicks
are manually picked up one by one and their necks are placed against an automatic
injection device; an injection needle is quickly advanced into the chick's neck, a
measured dose of medication is injected, and the needle is withdrawn. The
medication injected in this manner diffuses rapidly into the chick's vascular system.In an effort to provide poultry with a measure of immunity or resistance to
disease upon hatching, medication can also be administered before hatching.
Generally, eggs to be treated are placed on end with the air sac at the top; a small
hole is formed through the shell at the top, and an injection needle is passed 
downwardly through the hole, and desirably into the amnion, into which the
medication is discharged. Sometimes the embryo itself is unintentionally injected and
may die as a result.If the medication is a soluble vaccine, unintentional injection of the vaccine
into the air sac can be effective, however cell-associated vaccines are typically
ineffective if injected into the air sac. Egg injection methods and devices are
described in Sharma et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,458,630, Christensen, U.S. Patent No.
4,604,968, and Hebrank, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,681,063 and 4,903,635. As described
above, injection of medication into the amnion makes the entire quantity of the
medication immediately available to the embryo.Of particular concern to the poultry industry is the disease known generally as
coccidiosis, caused by protozoal parasitic organisms of the genus Eimeria. See,
generally, "Coccidiosis", pp. 153-157, in Avian
