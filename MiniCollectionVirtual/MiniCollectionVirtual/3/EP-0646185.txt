<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing one or more metals from a mineral feedstock (12) is defined. The mineral is fed to a leaching apparatus (10) wherein it is contacted with electrolyte (14). The leaching apparatus has zones of decreasing oxidation potential (17, 18, 19, 20) respectively. A stream of electrolyte (14A) is removed from zone (20) and is treated to remove impurities and unwanted metals in treatment unit (25A), prior to metal recovery by electrolysis. The electrolyte after electrolysis is then returned to the leaching unit (10). A second electrolyte stream (14B) may be removed from zone (19) for recovery of additional metals. The electrolyte (14B) is treated to remove impurities and any unwanted metals in treatment unit (25B), prior to metal recovery by electrolysis. The electrolyte after electrolysis is returned to leaching unit (10). The process enables the leaching of difficult to leach minerals, including gold, and can produce one or more metals of high purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of
metals from minerals, and more particularly to the
production of base and precious metals from ores and
concentrates, including the production of copper. The
invention will in part be hereinafter described with
reference to the treatment of sulfur containing ores,
however, it is to be appreciated that the invention is not
limited to this type of use. When the terms "mineral" or
"minerals" are used in the present specification they are
intended to include any metal-containing compound including
ores, concentrates, semi-refined metal compounds, metal
oxides and sulfides, flue dust etc.Processes are known for the treatment of minerals
containing one or two metals of particular interest for
removal of the metal(s). These processes become extremely
costly and complex to operate when treating minerals having
complex compositions. Furthermore the attaining of product
purity is also more difficult when the mineral has a complex
composition or contains many contaminants.A major problem today (and in the future) relates to
the disposal of waste and by-products resulting from the
existing treatment of minerals for metal recovery. For
sulfur containing minerals, this problem is exacerbated in
that a typical by-product is sulfur either in the form of
sulfur dioxide gas or sulfuric acid. Enormous atmospheric
emission problems stem from the production of sulfur dioxide
(including acid rain) and it has been usual to reclaim
sulfur dioxide by producing sulfuric acid. However,
sulfuric acid is so prevalent that many producers have
actually been required to incur cost for its removal from
site.Given the problems of the high level of waste and by-products
from the treatment of minerals, and more 
particularly to the by-production of sulfur dioxide/sulfuric
acid, attempts have been made to develop processes wherein
the disposal and/or reclaiming of by-products is simplified.US Patent No. 3,673,061 to Cyprus Metallurgical Process
Corporation describes the oxidation of copper sulfides in a
slurry at the anode of an electro-chemical cell, with the
requirement for an anode current density of at least 12 amps
per square foot for decomposition of the copper sulfide.
The presence of iron in many minerals results in a low anode
current efficiency for copper in this process due to power
consumed by iron oxidation. The electrolytic production of
iron in this process is very expensive and renders the
process uneconomic both in terms of efficiency and overall
cost.Australian patent
