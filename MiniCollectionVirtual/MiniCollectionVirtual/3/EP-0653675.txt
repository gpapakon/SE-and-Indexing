<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to color photographic 
elements and processes and especially to color 

photographic elements comprising two or more image 
forming layers sensitized to the same region of the 

electromagnetic spectrum where a more sensitive layer is 
positioned closer to an exposure source than a less 

sensitive layer and the less sensitive layer additionally 
comprises a spatially fixed absorber dye. The 

combination provides improved image sharpness without 
compromising photographic sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color photographic
elements and processes and especially to color
photographic elements comprising two or more image
forming layers spectrally sensitized to the same region
of the electromagnetic spectrum where a more sensitive
layer is positioned closer to an exposure source than a
less sensitive layer and the less sensitive layer
additionally comprises a spatially fixed absorber dye.
The combination provides improved image sharpness without
compromising photographic sensitivity.Among the desirable properties of a silver
halide photographic element is high sharpness; that is,
the element should enable faithful reproduction and
display of both coarse and fine details of an original
scene. Another desirable property of a photographic
element is high overall sensitivity. This combination of
properties has proven difficult to achieve in practice.A general description of the diffficulty in
achieving high levels of sharpness may be found in T.H.
James, ed., "The Theory of the Photographic Process,"
Macmillan, New York, 1977 and, in particular, at Chapter
20 of this text, pages 578-591, entitled "Optical
Properties of the Photographic Emulsion" by J. Gasper
and J. J. DePalma.One method of improving sharpness, disclosed at
U. S. Patent 4,312,941 and at U. S. Patent 4,391,884,
involves the incorporation of a spatially fixed absorber
dye in a film layer between the exposing light source and
any layer comprising a conventional grain light sensitive
silver halide emulsion sensitive to the region of the
electromagnetic spectrum absorbed by the spatially fixed 
absorber dye. In these disclosures, the absorber dye is
held spatially fixed either by means of a ballast group
or by means of a mordanting material incorporated at a
specified position in the film structure. Use of this
spatial arrangement of absorber dye and emulsion reduces
front-surface halation effects; that is, the spatially
fixed dye absorbs light that has been reflected from an
emulsion layer thus minimizing re-exposure at a position
other than that intended. This positioning of spatially
fixed dye has the difficulty that purposeful exposure is
also attenuated and film sensitivity is degraded.U. S. Patents 4,746,600 and 4,855,220 disclose
that larger degrees of sharpness can be attained by
combining spatially fixed absorber dyes and Development
Inhibitor Releasing Compounds (DIR Compounds) in a
photographic silver halide recording material. The
spatially fixed absorber dye is positioned between any
emulsion layer sensitive to
