<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to people moving
devices in general, and to combplates for people moving
devices in particular.Escalators, moving walkways, and other people
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of
pedestrian traffic from one point to another.
Passengers step on moving steps (or belts, or pallets)
and are transported along at a constant rate of speed.The steps are attached to a step chain which
travels in a closed loop from a first landing of the
people moving device to a second landing and back.
Specifically, the steps exit the first landing and
travel exposed from the first landing to the second
landing. From there, the steps reverse direction within
the second landing and return to the first landing
concealed within the frame of the device. Finally, the
steps reverse direction within the first landing,
thereby completing the loop.A person of ordinary skill in the art recognises
that safety is a significant concern in the entry and
exit points of the people moving device. Passengers go
from stepping on a surface at a zero velocity to
stepping on a surface at a constant velocity greater
than zero. As a result, there is an opportunity for a
passenger to lose his or her balance.Numerous solutions have been offered to address
these safety concerns. In some cases, for example,
cautionary signs are deployed near the entry and exit
points. These signs must be positioned out of the
moving path, however, or they too become a safety
hazard. Positioning the signs out of the moving path
decreases the effectiveness of the warning and detracts
aesthetically. In other cases, cautionary colors are
painted on either the steps or the landing entry 
(typically called the combplate) to highlight the
difference in velocity between the parts. The
difficulty with a painted coating is that a normal paint
wears off relatively quickly and therefore increases
maintenance costs as well as creating an aesthetic
blemish.In still other instances the steps are machined to
accept cautionary colored plastic inserts which are
typically riveted to the step. A disadvantage of this
approach is that the machining process significantly
increases the cost of the steps. In addition, if the
insert works free from the step, the now loose insert
and the machined step become a safety hazard.In short, what is needed is a durable means for
alerting passengers to the difference in surface
velocity at the entry and exit points of a people moving
device, which is easily recognizable.US 4126218 discloses a people moving device

<CLAIMS>
A combplate (10) for a people moving device (12),
comprising a body (28) having a top surface and a bottom

surface, a comb (30) having a plurality of fingers (32)

with a top surface and a bottom surface, and a polymeric
coating (34), having a color, bonded to said top surface

of at least said body, characterised in that said
polymeric coating is wear resistant and has a texture

which increases the gripping quality of the coating.
A combplate according to claim 1, wherein said top
surface of said body (28) further comprises a plurality

of slots (36) extending laterally across said body.
A combplate according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
polymeric coating (34) includes a plurality of raised

surfaces (42).
A combplate according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
polymeric coating (44) is also bonded to said top

surface of said comb (30).
A combplate according to any preceding claim, which
is for an escalator.
