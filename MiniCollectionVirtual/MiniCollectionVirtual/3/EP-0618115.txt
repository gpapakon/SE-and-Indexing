<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an 
apparatus for preventing excessive slipping of wheels of a 
motor vehicle upon acceleration or braking of the vehicle. A wheel of a motor vehicle will slip on a road 
surface to an excessive extent when a drive force 
transmitted to the wheel upon acceleration of the vehicle is 
excessive in relation to a force of friction between the 
wheel tire and the road surface, or when a brake force 
applied to the wheel upon braking of the vehicle is 
excessive in relation to the force of friction between the 
tire and the road surface. The acceleration or braking of 
the vehicle is effected in dependence on the force of 
friction between the wheel tire and the road surface. The 
force of friction is maximized when the ratio of slip of the 
wheel relative to the road surface (namely, the slip amount 
of the wheel divided by the vehicle speed) is optimum. 
Accordingly, the acceleration or braking of the vehicle need 
to be effected with the slip ratio or slip amount of the  
 
wheel maintained in an optimum range, so that the vehicle is 
accelerated or braked in a satisfactory fashion. In view of the above need, a brake system of a 
motor vehicle known in the art is adapted to effect a 
traction control of a wheel drive force and/or an anti-lock 
control of a wheel brake force. In the wheel traction 
control, a brake force is applied to a driving wheel of the 
vehicle to reduce an effective drive force generated by the 
driving wheel, for thereby avoiding excessive slipping of 
the driving wheel upon acceleration of the vehicle. In the 
anti-lock control, the brake force applied to a wheel of the 
vehicle is reduced so as to avoid excessive slipping of the 
wheel upon braking of the vehicle. The brake force applied to the vehicle wheel as 
described above is regulated in various manners. An example 
of such manners of regulating the brake force is disclosed 
in JP-A-2-3010161. According to this publication, the brake 
force is regulated on the basis of an amount of change in 
the rotating speed of the wheel, more specifically, on the 
basis of only the amount of change in the wheel speed, or on 
the basis of not only the wheel speed change amount but also 
another parameter such as the wheel speed per se or the 
vehicle speed. It is noted that an acceleration value of the 
wheel, which is the amount of change in the wheel speed per 
unit time, is considered to be a kind of the wheel speed 
change amount. In the present application, however, the 
amount of change in
