<ABSTRACT>
A container for a liquid comprising a soft, inner container 
(1) for containing the liquid and a rigid, outer container 

(2), the inner container (1) being disposed within the 
outer container (2), both containers (1, 2) having a 

discharge port (3) common to each other, approximately half 
from the discharge port side of each of faces (1c, 1d, 1e, 

1f) of the inner container (1) adjacent to the face (1a) 
with the discharge port (3) formed therein are bonded to 

the outer container (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container for a
liquid and more particularly to a container effective for
a liquid having a high viscosity.As a container for a liquid there has been known, as
shown in Fig. 13, a bag-in-box type container
(hereinafter referred to as "BIB container") comprising a
rigid, outer container 50 formed of a hard paperboard and
a soft, inner container (inner bag) 51 constituted by a
flexible bag and disposed within the outer container.In the BIB container, the outer container 50
protects the container against external impact, etc.
while retaining a predetermined box shape, and by
contraction of the inner container 51, a liquid 52 as the
contents of the inner container 51 can be withdrawn from
a discharge port 53.In the case where a liquid having a high viscosity,
e.g. ink, is contained in the BIB container, it can be
withdrawn from the inner container 51 by providing a
suction nozzle in the portion of the discharge port 53
and by suction of the liquid using a pump or the like.In the conventional BIB container, however, the
inner bag 51 is deformed irregularly during withdrawal of
the liquid 52 from the interior of the container,
resulting in that, as shown in Fig. 13, portions of the 
inner bag 51 adhere closely to each other to create an
independent compartment 54 within the inner bag and that
the liquid 52 in the compartment 54 stays therein without
being withdrawn, and the amount thereof is not constant.In the case of liquid suction using a pump, there
arises unevenness between the amount of liquid discharged
in the initial stage and that in the latter-half stage,
and thus it has so far been impossible to withdraw the
liquid from the inner bag in a constant volume from
beginning to end.The present invention has been accomplished in view
of the above-mentioned problems and it is the object of
the invention to provide a container for a liquid capable
of withdrawing the liquid uniformly from beginning to end
without staying in the container and while preventing
close adherence of portions of an inner container.EP-A-0 453 172 discloses a container according to the preamble of claim
1. The present invention is characterized by the features of the
characterizing portion of claim 1. Optional features are recited in the
remaining claims. In the above liquid containers of the present invention, an edge
portion defined by unbonded faces of the inner container
may be set larger in the radius of curvature than that
defined by the bonded faces. A corner of the side where an unbonded

<CLAIMS>
A container for a fluid comprising:

an outer container (2) substantially in the form of a
cube;
an inner container (1) substantially in the form of a
cube for containing said fluid therein disposed in said

outer container (2);
a discharge port (3) formed in said inner container
(1) for discharging said fluid outside said outer container

(2), the outer container (2) covering the whole of the inner container
(1) exclusive of the discharge port (3); and

   wherein a portion of said inner container (1) is
bonded to said outer container (2) so that a half portion

(EA,EC) on the side of said discharge port (3) is
undeformable and a half portion (EB,ED) is deformable, said

deformable portion (EB,ED) gets into said undeformable
portion (EA,EC) along the inside of said undeformable

portion (EA,EC) when said fluid in said inner container (1)
is ejected through said discharge port (3);

   characterised in that said discharge port (3) is
formed in a first face (1a) of said inner container (1) and

located in a position adjacent to a second face (1e) which is
adjacent to the first face (1a) where said discharge port (3) is

formed and in that there is a substantially triangular bonded portion on
each of the faces (1d, 1f) on the inner container (1) to the side of the

discharge port (3) which are facing each other and in contact with both
the first and second faces (1a,1e), wherein substantially halves of said

faces (1d,1f) are bonded to said outer container (2)
A container as claimed in claim 1 in which at 
least one portion of said face (1a) where said discharge

port (3) is formed and at least one portion of said face
(1e) which is adjacent to said face (1a) are fixed to said

outer container (2).
A container for a fluid according to claim 1 or
2, wherein the radius of curvature of an edge portion

defined by unbonded faces (1b,1c,1d,1f) of said inner
container (1) is larger than that of an edge portion

defined by bonded faces (1a,1e,1d,1f).
