<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for leak testing a blow moulded container (3) comprises an electrically conductive probe (2) for extending into the interior of the container (3) through an opening (4), and electrically conductive earth plates (10, 11, 12) for surrounding at least a major portion of the container (3). In order to test the container the probe (2) is introduced into the container (3) by an actuator (5), the earth plates (10, 11, 12) are placed in close proximity with the container walls by means of actuators (13, 14), and a high voltage is applied to the probe (2) by way of a connecting lead (9). A current sensor (15) is responsive to the occurrence of a spark between the probe (2) and the earth plates (10, 11, 12) thereby indicating the presence of a hole or weakness in the intervening container wall. Such apparatus can be implemented at relatively low cost and is highly reliable in practice, as well as requiring only a short testing cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to leak testing of 
containers, and is particularly, but not exclusively, 
concerned with the leak testing of blow moulded containers. It is an inherent feature of the blow moulding 
process used for producing plastics bottles and the like 
that small holes are sometimes formed in the container 
walls due to the occurrence of flaws in the moulding 
medium. It is therefore essential, in applications in 
which the container is required to be fluid tight, that 
each container is subjected to leak testing prior to use. 
Conventionally such leak testing is performed on a conveyor 
line by initially pressurising each container with air and 
subsequently detecting by means of a pressure transducer 
any decay of the pressure within the container which might 
indicate the occurrence of a leak. Whilst this leak method 
operates satisfactorily in practice, it requires use of a 
pressure transducer which is both costly and delicate. 
Also, since the method requires monitoring of the pressure 
within the container over a period of a few seconds, the 
period of each testing cycle cannot be decreased below a 
certain value. It is an object of the invention to provide 
generally improved apparatus and methods for leak testing 
such containers. According to the present invention there is provided 
apparatus for leak testing a container comprising an 
electrically conductive probe adapted to extend into the  
 
interior of the container by way of an opening of the 
container, electrically conductive shield means for 
location externally of the container, electrical connection 
means for application of a high voltage between the probe 
and the shield means, and sensor means for detecting the 
occurrence of a spark between the probe and the shield 
means indicating the presence of a hole or weakness in the 
intervening container wall, wherein the 
electrical connection means is arranged to apply the high 
voltage to the probe, and moving means is provided for 
moving the shield means between an open position permitting 
introduction of the container into, or removal of the 
container from, the shield means and a closed position in 
which at least a major portion of the container is 
surrounded by the shield means. Such apparatus can be implemented at relatively low 
cost and is highly reliable in practice. It is capable of 
detecting not only very small holes in the container wall, 
but also weaknesses in the container wall provided that a 
sufficiently high voltage is used. Since the occurrence of
