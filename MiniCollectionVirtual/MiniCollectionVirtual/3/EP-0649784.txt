<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods of training the crews of mine-hunters. It consists in utilising a module (105) which is separate from the mine and comprises the same detection members as this mine (102) could contain. The module is situated in the vicinity of, or even on, the mine. It transmits to the mine-hunter (101) the data detected by means of its sensors. It makes it possible to utilise a module of small size which is easily recoverable, to simulate in real time a great number of mine firings, to evaluate the performance of the hunter faced with these mines or to evaluate the performance of a mine faced with a target.

<CLAIMS>
Training method for minehunting, in which a
minehunter (101) attempts to locate and identify a

submerged mine (102), 
characterized in that
 use is
made of an exercise module (103) which is

associated with the mine but separate from the
latter and the shape, dimensions, contents and an

anechoic coating of which make it invisible with
respect to the mine with which is associated, the

said module being placed in proximity thereto and
includes at least the same detection components as

the mine contains or might contain.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the module (103) furthermore comprises means for
transmission between it and the minehunter (101),

making it possible at least to transmit to this
minehunter the data representing the operation of

its detection components.
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

these transmission means also make it possible to
transmit, from the
 minehunter (101) to the module
(103), data intended to reconfigure the processing

components of the module.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the module (103) rests on
the seabed in proximity to the mine. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the module (403) is fixed on
the mine (402).
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the mine (111) is a buoyant
mine, and 
in that
 the module (113) is fixed to
this mine.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the data exchanged between
the hunter (101) and the module (103) allow remote

localization of the module from the hunter.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the data received by the
hunter (101) make it possible to simulate the

electronics of mines including a plurality of
combinations of sensors for the module (103).
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the module (103) is
connected to a sub-module which is remote from it

and includes remote-control recovery means.
