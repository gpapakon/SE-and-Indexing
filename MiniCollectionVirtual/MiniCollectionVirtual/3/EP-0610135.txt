<ABSTRACT>
Method of heat treatment after the welding of two workpieces made of different grades of alloy steel, the first workpiece, called A, having critical heating transformation temperatures AC1A and AC3A and an optimal post-weld treatment temperature  theta A less than AC1A, the second workpiece, called B, having critical heating transformation temperatures AC1B and AC3B, which are respectively less than AC1A and AC3A, and an optimum post-weld treatment temperature  theta B less than AC1B and less than  theta A, characterised in that a first thermal cycle for treatment at the said temperature  theta A is carried out followed by a second thermal cycle at a temperature  theta B. Between the two cycles, the temperature is lowered to below 100@C.

, the method being characterized in that a first heat treatment cycle is
carried out at said temperature 
A
 followed by a second heat treatment cycle
at a temperature 
B
, the temperature being reduced to below 100°C between
the two cycles.
A method of heat treatment according to claim 1, characterized in that said
first treatment cycle, at the temperature 
A
 exceeds the temperature AC

B,
the complete treatment therefore constituting, for material B, an inter-critical

treatment.
A method according to either of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that at least
the first treatment cycle affects only the deposited filler metal (1) and the

immediately adjacent portions (2, 3) of the two welded-together parts (A, B).
