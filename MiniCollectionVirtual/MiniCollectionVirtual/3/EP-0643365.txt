<ABSTRACT>
Device for emulating a personal computer printer (3) from a facsimile printer (14), comprising means (21) for receiving data from the computer (3) and means (22-25) for controlling the printer (14) on the basis of these data and configured so as to poll the printer (14) and determine its availability (41A), in which the means of control (22-25) are configured to perform cyclic polling (27) of the printer (14) and to control its printing via the data from the computer (3) when the printer is available (41A).

Device for emulating a printer of a personal computer (3) from the printer (12-14) of a
facsimile machine which includes circuits (15, 19) for controlling the printer (12-14) by

means of facsimile data, the device comprising means (21) for receiving data from the
computer (3) and means (22-25) for controlling the printer (12-14) according to these data

and arranged to scan the printer (12-14), to determine the availability (41A) thereof and to
manage the printing thereof when the control circuits (15, 19) leave it available,

characterised in that the control means (22-25) are arranged to carry out cyclic scanning
(27) of the printer (12-14) and control its printing by the data of the computer (3) when

the printer is available (41 A).
Device according to claim 1, wherein the said means (22-25) for controlling the printer
(14) comprise a scanning loop (53-57) including memory means (26) for receiving

data from the computer (3).
Device according to claim 2, wherein the scanning loop includes an AND gate (27)
connected by a first input to the memory means (26) and arranged to be connected by a

second input to means (17) which are sensitive to the state of availability of the printer
(14).
Device according to claim 2, wherein the control means include conversion means (22, 23)

to convert control data of the data of the computer (3) into data selected in a
predetermined menu.
Process for emulating a printer of a personal computer (3) from the printer (12-14) of a
facsimile machine which includes circuits (15, 19) for controlling the printer (12-14) by

facsimile data, a process in which the computer (3) is connected to a printer emulation
device (11) of the facsimile machine activated by the reception of data from the computer

(3) and arranged to manage the printing thereof when the control circuits (15, 19) leave it
available, the process being characterised in that, after activation (54) of the emulation 

device (11) and generation of a printing request (54A), the emulation device (11) scans
(55) the printer (12-14) and determines its availability and, if it is not available, the printing

request (54A) is stored (57) to cause cyclic scanning (53) of the printer to activate (60) the
printing of data from the computer (3) when the printer (14) becomes available (41A).
