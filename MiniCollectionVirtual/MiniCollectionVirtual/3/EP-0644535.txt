<ABSTRACT>
A wear-resistant end cap (30) is provided for an air bearing slider (10) of a thin film 
magnetic recording head useful in a disk drive. The slider has an air bearing surface 

(19) that is positioned adjacent to a rotating surface of a magnetic disk during data 
recording or readout. A thin film transducer (11) is deposited in the trailing end of the 

slider perpendicular to the air bearing surface (19). A laminated end cap (30) is 
deposited on the trailing end surface disposed normal to the disk recording surface to 

protect the transducer (11). The end cap (30) includes a first lamination disposed with 
an edge in a plane parallel to the air bearing surface (19) of the slider and a second 

contiguous lamination of a different material having an edge in the plane whereby the 
edge areas of the contiguous laminations (32) have r
elatively more wear resistance than 
the wear resistance of an equivalent edge area of either material taken alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air bearing thin film magnetic heads 
and in particular to a wear-resistant end cap for such magnetic 
heads. Air bearing thin film magnetic recording heads are used 
extensively in disk drives that store information. An air 
bearing thin film magnetic recording head typically comprises an 
air bearing slider and a magnetic transducer that is deposited on 
an end of the slider. The transducer is formed with a magnetic 
yoke having spaced first and second pole piece layers that define 
a transducing gap and an electrically conductive coil structure 
between the magnetic layers. A disk drive generally comprises 
one or more magnetic disks on which data is stored. During 
operation of the disk drive, an air bearing thin film magnetic 
head associated with a disk surface is positioned to selected 
ones of a plurality of concentric recording tracks on the disk 
surface so that data may be transferred to and from the track as 
the magnetic disk rotates. The data track density and bits per 
inch along the track are directly related to how close the thin 
film magnetic transducer which is at the air bearing surface of 
the slider can be made to fly over the disk surface. The art 
suggests various air bearing slider configurations to optimize 
the various trade-offs between flying height and wear. Some wear 
occurs on the magnetic head and on the magnetic disk surface at 
very low flying heights, since the disk, when inspected 
microscopically, has a surface topography with peaks and valleys 
which can cause contact of the trailing edge of the slider and 
the disk surface. The end surface of the head slider is normal to the recording  
 
surface of the disk when the slider is positioned adjacent to the 
disk. An end cap is deposited over the thin film transducer 
structure to protect the transducer from physical damage during 
the manufacturing process. The slider member is made either from 
aluminum oxide/titanium carbide or silicon carbide, by way of 
example. The multilayered transducer deposited on the slider 
member includes a base layer of insulation material, such as 
alumina, a P1 layer formed from a magnetic material, such as 
Permalloy, a winding layer of insulated copper turns, a P2 layer 
of magnetic material or Permalloy and an end cap. The end cap 
typically comprises a material such as sputter deposited alumina, 
which after being deposited does not cause any undue stress in 
the layers of the transducer member. It has been found that some 
materials which would appear to
