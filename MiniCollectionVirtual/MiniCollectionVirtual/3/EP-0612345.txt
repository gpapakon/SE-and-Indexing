<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a filler for electrical and optical devices like cables, strips, plugs, etc., which is characterized by containing a material with a star-shaped molecular structure. Such includes especially an oligo-dec-1-en with a degree of oligomerisation of 3 and over. If to this is added finely divided silicic acid and a high-molecular polyolefine or a viscosity improver like hydrated polyisoprene, fillers are obtained having improved thermal properties like cone penetration at -50  DEG C and leak resistance up to +80  DEG C.

<CLAIMS>
A filling compound for electrical and optical 
equipment in the form of cables, connectors, plugs, etc. 

which contains a stellate substance, i.e. a substance 
having a branched molecular structure in which, ideally, 

3 or more branches radiate from a single branching point 
or a substance having several branching points providing 

the intervals between them are so small by comparison 
with the length of the side chain that the ratio of the 

atoms forming the main chain to the atoms forming the 
side chain is 1:3 or less, and the stellate substance 

having a viscosity in the range from 10 to 500 mm
2
/s 
(cSt) at 40°C, as determined in accordance with ASTM 

D445. 
A filling compound as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
by a poly-α-olefin, more particularly an oligo-dec-1-ene 

having a degree of oligomerization of 3 or 
more as the stellate substance. 
A filling compound as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
by an addition of a mineral oil, preferably in 

a quantity of 1 to 5% by weight, based on the stellate 
substance. 
A filling compound as claimed in at least one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized by the addition of a highly 

disperse silica and/or a high molecular weight polyolefin, 
more particularly a polybutene. 
A filling compound as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
by a content by weight of 0.5 to 6% by weight of 

highly disperse silica and/or 0.05 to 2% by weight of 

high molecular weight polyolefin, based on the stellate 
substance. 
A filling compound as claimed in at least one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized by the addition of a 

viscosity index improver, preferably in a quantity of 1 
to 20% by weight, based on the stellate substance.  

 
A filling compound as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
by a cone penetration of more than 200 at -50°C 

and resistance to flow up to a temperature of at least 
80°C. 
Electrical and optical equipment in the form of 
cables, connectors, plugs etc. containing the filling 

compound claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 7. 
The use of the filling compound claimed in at 
least one of claims 1 to 7 as a wire filling compound 

for the production of optical cables.
