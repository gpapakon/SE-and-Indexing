<ABSTRACT>
CHCl₃ is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of 
CCl₄ in the liquid phase, with a supported Pt or Pd 

catalyst, and in the presence of at least one solvent. 
The reduction reaction can be carried our both 
continuously and batchwise and can be applied to the 

industrial production of CHCl₃.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing chloroform by starting from carbon 
tetrachloride; the process is based on the catalytic 
reduction of CCl₄ in the liquid phase, with supported 
Pt or Pd catalysts and in the presence of at least one 
solvent. The reduction reaction can be carried out both 
continuously and batchwise and can be applied to the 
industrial production of CHCl₃; it is carried out in 
the presence of suitable catalysts and using pure 
hydrogen at temperatures comprised within the range of 
from a minimal value of 100°C up to > 160°C, with the 
pressure values being comprised within the range of 
from 10 to 50 atmospheres. The present invention also relates to chloroform 
obtained according to the process of the present 
invention. The reaction of reduction of carbon tetrachloride 
to chloroform is known from the prior art; it was not 
very widely used heretofore, owing to the poor 
availability of CCl₄, largely used in CFC's synthesis. However, the recent limitations to use of CFC's, 
imposed owing to the recognized effect of depletion of 
the stratospheric ozone layer caused by them, led to a 
very large availability of CCl₄ on the market, and to 
the consequent search for alternative usages; among 
them, the use in chloroform production was the most 
deeply studied one. In general, the methods proposed by the present  
 
state of the art are based on the reaction of CCl₄ 
reduction with hydrogen in the absence of solvents; 
more generally, the reactions carried out in gas phase 
or liquid phase are known, in which the liquid phase 
consists of the same CCl₄. However, all processes known from the prior art 
are based on catalytic hydrogenation reaction of CCl₄, 
as schematically shown as follows:

CCl₄ + H₂ ----cat.----> CHCl₃ + HCl


 
   From the various examples of liquid phase 
reaction of carbon tetrachloride, we remind EP 0 460 
138 and Japanese patent application JP 91/119,457, 
and, as examples of gas phase reaction, we remind US 
2,886,605 which discloses a process using a catalyst 
based on copper halide on fluidized bed; US 3,579,596 
to DOW Chem., using a Pd based catalyst on fixed bed 
and EP 0 486 091 to Solvay, which discloses a gas 
phase process using methane as diluent. All the proposed systems which, as said, operate 
in gas phase or in liquid phase in the absence of 
solvents, respectively display two main types of 
drawbacks: 
(a) They coproduce large amounts of methane (Solvay, 
Atochem), causing an increase in hydrogen 
consumption; (b) They
