<ABSTRACT>
A radio selective calling receiver including an exchangeable 
first battery and a second battery which can be charged by the 

first battery. A CPU stops operating at a stop voltage. A RAM 
stores a user data. A stop detector detects operational stop 

of the CPU. A power supply changer changes one of the first and 
second batteries into the other and selectively supplies one of 

electric energies of the batteries to the CPU, RAM and stop 
detector. The minimum operable voltages of the RAM and the stop 

detector are lower than the stop voltage. The first battery 
supplies its electric energy to the CPU, RAM and stop detector 

until the supply voltage of the first battery lowers to the stop 
voltage. The power supply changer changes the first battery 

into the second battery when the operational stop of the CPU is 
detected, so that the second battery supplies its electric 

energy to the CPU, RAM and stop detector until the first battery 
thus lowered in supply voltage is exchanged by a new one. The 

capacity of the first battery can be effectively used without 
any malfunction of the receiver and no troublesome reinput 

action is required for the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selective-calling radio
receiver such as a pager and more particularly, to a selective-calling
radio receiver equipped with an exchangeable battery
such as a dry battery as its power supply.A conventional selective-calling radio receiver or a pager
has a voltage monitoring circuit for monitoring the voltage of
a primary battery incorporated therein as its power supply in
order to avoid malfunction due to voltage reduction of the
battery. The monitoring circuit causes a Central Processing
Unit (CPU) of the receiver to generate an alarm signal for
exchanging the battery when the battery voltage thus monitored
becomes lower than a given reference voltage. The user or
holder exchanges the battery in response to the alarm signal.Fig. 1 shows a time chart for explaining the operation of
the receiver. It is seen from Fig. 1 that the voltage of the
battery reduces as the times go by and a Low-Voltage Alarm (LVA)
is produced when the voltage becomes to a first reference
voltage v1.As shown in Fig. 1, usually, the first reference voltage V1 
is set to be a little higher than a second reference voltage V2
which is called as a "CPU stop voltage" here. The CPU becomes
to stop or malfunction if the voltage of the battery lowers to
the CPU stop voltage V2.The first reference voltage V1 is higher than the second
reference voltage V2, so that the CPU does not stop immediately
even if the voltage of the battery lowers to the first reference
voltage V1. As a result, the holder of the receiver has a
sufficient time for exchanging the battery after the LVA alarm
is produced.Also, in the case that the conventional receiver is provided
with an alarm means for producing the LVA alarm such as a
vibrator through which a large current flows, the alarm means
start to operate when the battery voltage becomes to the first
reference voltage V1, so that the CPU is difficult to stop even
if the battery voltage lowers than the first reference voltage
V1 momentarily due to operation of the alarm means.In this case, the CPU sometimes stops to operate because the
battery voltage momentarily drops to the second reference
voltage V2 and restarts to operate. The data stored in the
Random Access Memory (RAM) of the receiver is initialized
together with the restart. Therefore, there arises a problem
that peculiar user data stored in the RAM disappears and the
user must reinput his data into the RAM, which requires the user 
for some troublesomeness.In addition, as described above, with the conventional
selectiv
