<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a gas generator for an airbag, especially in a motor vehicle, which generator is composed of a pressurised container for receiving a heavily compressed gas under a high pressure and has at least one opening, which is sealed by means of a seal, in the pressurised container and an initiating mechanism. In order to produce a gas generator for airbags which has the aforementioned features and a simplified structure, and is therefore cheaper to produce and yet functions reliably, it is proposed according to the invention that the seal (2) be sufficiently weak for it not to withstand the nominal pressure of the gas introduced into the pressurised container (1) on its own and for an additional supporting element (4) to be provided which can be moved away by the initiating mechanism and which supports that side of the seal (2) which faces away from the aperture (3).

A gas generator for an airbag, in particular in a motor vehicle, consisting 
of a pressure vessel (1) to receive an intensively compressed gas under high 

pressure, with at least one opening (3), closed by a seal (2), in the pressure 
vessel (1), and with a release mechanism, characterised in that the seal (2) is 

constructed so be so weak that it does not withstand the nominal pressure of the 
gas filling in the pressure vessel (1) alone, that it is secured on the outer wall of 

the pressure vessel and that an additional support element (4) is provided, which 
is able to be moved away by the release mechanism and which supports the seal 

(2). 
A gas generator according to Claim 1, characterised in that the pressure 
vessel (1) has at least one filling opening (9). 
A gas generator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
pressure vessel (1) has the form of a torus, in which the torus body has an 

approximately circular cross-section. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the seal (2) is arranged on the inner ring surface of the torus defining the ring 

opening of the torus. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the inner ring surface of the torus is constructed at least in sections in cylinder 

wall shape or flat. 
A gas generator according to Claim 5, characterised in that on the inner 
surface, defining the ring opening of the torus, a radially inwardly projecting 

flange (10) is provided, which with the formation of a shoulder offers an axial  
 

support surface for the support element. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 3 to 6, characterised in that 
the torus consists of at least two parts, one of which is an inner ring (5) defining 

the ring opening of the torus, which inner ring (5) has radially directed outlet 
openings (3), has at least in the region of the outlet openings (3) a cylindrical 

inner wall and also has a flange (10) axially delimiting the cylindrical inner wall 
and projecting radially inwards, the one surface of which flange (10) forms a 

bearing shoulder (11) for the support element (4) and/or the seal (2). 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 7, charcterised in that 
several outlet openings (3) are provided along the inner side of the torus-shaped 

pressure vessel (1). 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
the seal consists of a relatively thin metal sheet. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that 
the support element (4) has an approximately cylindrical outer contour and is 

provided radially within the ring-shaped torus opening and substantially filling 
the latter. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the seal is a ring of a thin metal sheet, preferably of high-grade steel. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that 
the seal consists of a cup-shaped, deep-drawn metal sheet, preferably with 

openings on the front side. 
A gas generator according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised in that the  
 

seal is welded onto the inner ring surface of the torus (1) with covering of the at 
least one opening (3). 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that 
the support element is constructed as a firing pin, in which a pyrotechnic heating 

charge is arranged approximately on the torus axis in front of the firing pin. 
A gas generator according to Claim 14, characterised in that the support 
element is a hollow cylindrical body, closed on a front face, with a firing pin 

point on the outer side of the front face. 
A gas generator according to Claim 14 or 15, characterised in that the 
release mechanism for the movement of the support element (4) has a 

pyrotechnic charge with ignition mechanism. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 16, characterised in that 
the support element (4) consists of a sinter metal. 
A gas generator according to one of Claims 1 to 17, characterised in that 
it is arranged in the steering wheel cap of a motor vehicle, in which the torus 

axis runs approximately parallel to the steering wheel axis.
