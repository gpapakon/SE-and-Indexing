<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a preservative for protecting wood against decay. According to the method wood is treated with a wood preservative capable of preventing the growth and spread of fungi, said preservative containing at least one complexing agent which binds at least a portion of those metals, typically iron and manganese, naturally occurring in wood that are essential to the growth of fungi. The complexing agents employed can be, e.g. ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (EDTA), ethylenediamine-di-(o-hydroxyphenylacetate (EDDHA), a polyphosphate (Na5P3O10) or a siderophore produced by a microorganism. The wood preservative used in the method is water-borne and specific to the decay fungi attacking wood.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wood preservation method according to the 
preamble of claim 1. According to such a method, wood is treated with a preservative capable of 
preventing wood decay fungi and similar microorganisms, which have the 
capability of decomposing lignocellulosic compounds, from growing and spreading 
in wood. Wood decay fungi and a number of other microorganisms can metabolically utilize 
the structural components of wood cells. Brown-rot fungi, for example, decompose 
only the cellulose and hemicellulose of the wood structure, while white-rot decay 
fungi can also utilize the lignin components of wood. Brown-rot decay is characterized 
by a rapid deterioration of strength properties of wood in the initial stage 
of decay even before any visible changes are evident. This fact is one of the 
reasons, why brown-rot wood decay fungi are the worst culprits in boreal climate 
zones for causing damages in timber and wood constructions, accounting for 
annual losses of several billions of Finnmarks through decay in sawn timber as 
well as residential and other buildings constructed with wooden components. Wood can be protected chemically against damages caused by decay fungi by 
various preservation methods based on preservatives of varying efficacy. Wood 
preservatives employed in the art can be coarsely classified in three categories: 1) 
water-borne preservatives, 2) oil-borne preservatives and 3) creosote oil. An 
outline of each of these categories is given: 
1) Fixing-type water-borne salt preservatives contain copper, chromium and 
arsenic (CCA preservatives) as the active components. Fixing-type preservatives  
 
are intended for a long-term protection of wood. Nonfixing salt-based 
preservatives employ various boron and fluorine compounds as the active 
components. The latter type of preservatives give a limited time of protection, 
since the protecting compounds are subject to leach-out by environmental 
moisture. 2) Oil-based preservatives contain one or more active constituents in an organic 
solvent, conventionally a light petroleum oil of the solvent naphtha grade. The 
active compounds can be tributyl tin naphthenate (TBTN), tributyl tin oxide 
(TBTO), mixtures of penta- and tetrachlorophenols, phoxim and dichlofluanid. 3) Creosote oil is a fraction of coal tar distilling above 200 Â°C. Analysis of 
creosote oil has identified about 300 different compounds, most of them occurring 
in very low concentrations. The efficacy of creosote oil in the inhibition of

<CLAIMS>
A method for protecting wood against decay and similar degradation reactions 
caused by wood decay fungi and similar microorganisms, according to which 

method the wood structure is treated with a wood preservative capable of 
preventing the growth and spread of microorganisms, characterized in that the wood 

preservative has a composition containing at least one complexing agent which 
when applied to the wood structure binds at least a portion of those metals naturally 

occurring in wood that are essential to the growth of wood decay fungi.

employed to bind a substantial portion of the transition metals incorporated in the 

wood structure.
