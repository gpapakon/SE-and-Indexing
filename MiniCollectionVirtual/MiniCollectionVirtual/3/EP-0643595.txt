<ABSTRACT>
A personal portable air conditioner or air purifier with a carrying arrangement, which includes a neck strap (11), delivers conditioned or purified air to the head/facial area of the user. The apparatus consists of a filter/fan unit (8, 2), arranged to direct a concentrated flow of conditioned or purified air toward the user's mouth and nose. The filter/fan unit may also be kept secure in its position by a lower belt (fig. 4) which is included in the carrying arrangement, or for instance by using braces or a tight fitting pocket in a useful position. The filter/fan unit is also equipped with a rapid fastening arrangement, for instance a Velcro

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to personal portable air fan apparatus for persons with health
problems due to air quality. These health problems include headache, fatigue, depressions,
etc. and possibly some types of allergic and asthmatic reactions as well.To improve air quality there are many devices available. However, most have the common
disadvantage of purifying air only in the immediate surroundings without always securing
sufficient purification and improvement of air closest to the user's head/facial and breathing
area.Even when using expensive stationary air conditioners and purification equipment, users may still
breathe polluted and noxious air when for instance cigarette smoke comes between the user and
the air purifying unit.Having some health problems due to air pollution, the inventor has been experimenting since 1977
making both stationary and portable air purifiers. He came to the conclusion that he benefited most
when using an air purifier dose to his breathing organs. Therefore, he made air purifiers smaller
and portable, because other purifiers on the market were stationary and consequently did not solve
the health problems mentioned above.In a German publication, DE 27 33 729 B 2,  a stationary air purifier with a combination of ionizer
and fan has been presented earlier. This purifier does not solve the above mentioned problems as
it is stationary.The inventor designed several small air purifiers which are portable and use a neck strap. He also
designed portable ionizers having certain similar features as those types which were later patented
by others, see Norwegian laid-open publication # 167246 and international publication # WO
92/16251. According to the inventors experience, none of these ionizers offer a satisfactory
solution to health problems like headache, fatigue, and other discomfort related to air pollution
This lack of effect also seems to be confirmed by doctors that have made investigations in this
regard. Another disadvantage to ionizers is that they contain a high voltage unit and are
surrounded by an electric field which may cause discomfort to some persons. Short-term use of
ionizers is considered acceptable by health professionals, but there are questions concerning
long-term effects. Experiments show that long-term use of portable ionizers close to the body may
cause discomfort to susceptible persons. In areas having variable and poor air quality, the air will normally consist of far more
noxious gases and pollutants that can possibly be purified by a simple portable

Personal portable air fan apparatus comprising:

a filter/fan unit (2,8) arranged to contain a filter (8) and having an air inlet (63), a
fan (2) and an air outlet (10); and
carrying means (11) for positioning the filter/fan unit on a user's chest;

   characterized in that:
the filter/fan unit (2, 8) is arranged to discharge a concentrated airstream upwards
from the air outlet (10) and into the atmosphere; and
the carrying means (11) is arranged to position the air outlet (10) below the user's
face so that the upward airstream from the air outlet is directed up towards the user's mouth

and nose.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the carrying means includes a lower
belt (68, 69).
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the filter/fan unit (2, 8) includes rapid
fastening means (20) for enabling one or more air influencing units to be attached to the

filter/fan unit (2, 8) as optional parts of the apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the air influencing unit(s) comprise one or
more of an ionizing unit (Fig. 3 or Fig. 8), an air cooling/humidifying unit (24, 61, 62) and

an airstream steering device (14A, 14B, 50-58, Fig. 6, 64).
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the airstream steering device comprises
detectors (52, 53) for detecting head movement of the user and controllable devices (51, 56,

57, 58) in or by the air outlet for changing the airstream direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the airstream steering device comprises a
manually adjustable directing fin (Fig. 6, 64) having a base attachable to the top of the

filter/fan unit (2, 8).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-6, wherein the ionizing unit is arranged
to ionize the departing airstream, is attachable to the front (Fig. 3) or top (Fig. 8) of the

filter/fan unit (2, 8) and is adjustable (17) regarding the amount of ionization.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-7, wherein the cooling/humidifying unit
is a thermoelectric cooling unit.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 4-7, wherein the cooling/humidifying unit
(24, 61, 62) contains refrigerated material such as ice or dry ice.
Apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the cooling/humidifying unit comprises an
outer insulated covering case (61) and an inner cooling sheath (62) having a shape

conforming to the exterior shape of the filter/fan unit (2,8) or to the exterior shape of the
filter/fan unit when a different one of the air influencing units is attached thereto.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the filter/fan unit
