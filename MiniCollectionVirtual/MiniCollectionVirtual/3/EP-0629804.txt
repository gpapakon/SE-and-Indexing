<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for determining operability of 
a motor operated valve combination including a valve having a 

valve stem, a valve disc, a valve seat, and a motor operator 
having a motor drive interconnecting the motor to the valve 

stem for movement of the valve disc toward and into engagement 
with the valve seat to close the valve and a control switch 

for deactivating the motor. The method comprises the steps of 
sensing the real motor power of the motor as a function of 

time during valve closing with zero differential pressure 
applied to the valve at a first time. From the sensed 

information, the rate of motor power build-up is determined 
after the onset of valve wedging during valve closing at the 

first time. The real motor power of the motor is again sensed 
as a function of time during valve closing with zero 

differential pressure applied to the valve at a second time 
which is subsequent to the first time. The rate of motor 

power build-up after the onset of valve wedging during valve 
closing at the second time is determined from the sensed 

information. The rate of motor power build-up after the onset 
of valve wedging at the first and second times is compared as 

an indication of lubrication change within the valve between 
the first and second times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to motor
operated valve combinations and, more particularly, to a
method for remotely determining operability including thrust
margin, stem lubrication spring pack relaxation and hydraulic lock of a motor operated valve.Motor operated valve combinations or valves are
commonly used in nuclear and other power plants to perform
routine opening and closing of water and steam lines and, more
importantly, for those valves designated as safety related, to
perform such openings or closings to assure the prompt, safe
shutdown of the plant under accident or other emergency or
abnormal operating conditions. For those valves of this class
whose safety function is to close a water, steam or other
line, it is important that the valve achieve full or complete
closure when called upon to do so. Most motor operated valves
in use today are controlled by a torque switch which shuts off
or stops the operation of the operator motor when a
predetermined valve actuator torque limit is reached and a
spring pack or other component moves in response to actuator
torque in excess of the limit to trip or actuate the torque
switch. Since the torque switch displacement is approximately
proportional to the actuator torque above some preload torque,
and since the actuator torque is approximately proportional to
the stem force, the torque switch displacement set point can
be and generally is used to turn off the motor at
approximately the valve stem force required to fully close the
valve. A certain amount of stem thrust is also required for a
motor operated valve (MOV) to close against differential
pressure. The required thrust can be calculated as the sum of
the packing friction force, the stem rejection force, and the
differential pressure force. The packing friction force is 
the force required to push the valve stem through the packing
which has been compressed against the stem to prevent leakage.
The stem rejection force is the internal pressure force trying
to spit out or reject the valve stem. It is equal to the
internal line pressure times the cross sectional area of the
stem. The differential pressure force is the friction force
opposing the inward movement of the valve disc as it is pushed
in by the valve stem to close off the opening of the valve.
It is equal to the differential pressure across the valve
times the effective area of the valve disc times the
coefficient of friction of the valve disc against the
downstream seat, this coefficient of friction is often
referred to as the
