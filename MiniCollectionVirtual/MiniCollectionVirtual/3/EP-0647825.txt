<ABSTRACT>
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism, which 
comprises a slider (50) provided to be movable along the barrel (2), a 

movable member (54;60) provided to be movable along moving directions of 
the slider (50) between a bullet holding chamber (4a) provided at the 

back of the barrel (2) and a pressure receiving portion (51A) fixed in 
the slider (50) to be positioned at the back of the barrel (2) and 

movable with the slider (50), and a gas passage controller (25;62) 
provided to be movable in the movable member (54;60), wherein the gas 

passage controller (25;62) is operative selectively to control a first 
gas passage extending from a pressure accumulating chamber (33) through 

the movable member (54;60) to the bullet holding chamber (4a) to be 
open so that gas discharged from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) 

is supplied through the first gas passage to the bullet holding chamber 
(4a) and to control a second gas passage extending from the pressure 

accumulating chamber (33) through the movable member (54;60) to the 
pressure receiving portion (51A) to be open so that gas discharged from 

the pressure accumulating chamber (33) acts through the second gas 
passage on the pressure receiving portion (51A) to cause first the 

slider (50) to move back and then the movable member (54;60) also to 
move back for making preparations for supplying the bullet holding 

chamber (4a) with a sham bullet from a magazine (31) for containing sham 
bullets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a model gun with 
automatic bullet supplying mechanism, and more particularly to an 
improvement in a model gun having an automatic bullet supplying 
mechanism which is operative to supply automatically a bullet holding 
chamber provided just at the back of a barrel with a sham bullet which 
is to be shot with gas pressure. A model gun which is often called an air soft gun is made to 
imitate a real gun in not only its color and shape but also its 
apparent operations. As for one of these model guns, which is made to 
imitate a real gun having a slider provided to be able to move back and 
forward along a barrel thereof in accordance with triggering action, it 
has been proposed to make such an arrangement that gas pressure is used 
for supplying a bullet holding chamber provided just at the back of a 
barrel with a sham bullet and further for shooting the sham bullet put 
in the bullet holding chamber, as shown in, for example, Japanese 
utility model application published before examination under publication 
number 3-38593. According to the arrangement thus proposed, a pressure 
accumulating bomb in which compressed air is contained and which has an 
air leading passage controlled to be open and closed selectively by an  
 
operation valve, a magazine for containing sham bullets, first and 
second valves, first and second air passages and a bullet supplying 
lever are provided in a grip, an air cylinder is positioned in a slider 
which is provided to be able to move back and forward along a barrel to 
be opposite to the rear end of the barrel with a magazine plate between, 
and a rotary cam engaging with the magazine plate to move the same 
upward and downward and a spring guide member which moves together with 
the slider are further provided, so that each of the sham bullets 
contained in the magazine is supplied to the inside of the barrel and 
then shot through the barrel with the compressed air discharged from 
the pressure accumulating bomb. A further model gun of the prior art (according to Article 54(3) EPC) is published in 
EP-A-625 689. According to this document, there is provided a model gun with 
auomatic bullet supplying mechanism, which comprises a magazine for containing sham 
bullets provided in a grip, a pressure accumulating chamber provided in the grip for 
accumulating gas pressure, a bullet holding chamber provided at the back of a barrel to 
be close to one end of the magazine, a slider provided to be movable along the barrel, a 
pressu

A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism, which 
comprises a magazine (31) for containing sham bullets provided in a 

grip (6), a pressure accumulating chamber (33) provided in the grip (6) 
for accumulating gas pressure, a bullet holding chamber (4a) provided at 

the back of a barrel (2) to be close to one end of the magazine (31), a 
slider (50) provided to be movable along the barrel (2), a pressure 

receiving portion (51A) provided to be movable with the slider (50), a movable 
member (54;60) provided between the bullet holding chamber (4a) and the 

pressure receiving portion (51A) to be movable along moving directions 
of the slider (50), and a gas passage controller (25;62) provided to be 

movable in the movable member (54:60) for controlling each of a first 
gas passage extending from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) 

through the movable member (54:60) to the bullet holding chamber (4a) 
and a second gas passage extending from the pressure accumulating 

chamber (33) through the movable member (54;60) to the pressure 
receiving portion (51A) to be open and closed selectively, said gas 

passage controller (25;62) being operative selectively to control the 
first gas passage to be open so that gas discharged from the pressure 

accumulating chamber (33) is supplied through the first gas passage to 
the bullet holding chamber (4a) and to control the second gas passage 

to be open so that gas discharged from the pressure accumulating 
chamber (33) acts through the second gas passage on the pressure 

receiving portion (51A) to cause first the slider (50) to move back and 
then the movable member (54:60) also to move back for making 

preparations for supplying the bullet holding chamber (4a) with the 
sham bullet from the end of the magazine (31), characterized 

in that said movable member (54,60) is provided therein 
with a first common gas passage (23) connected with each of gas 

passages (21,22) forming a part of the first gas passage and a part of 
the second gas passage, respectively, and further coupled, selectively 

in accordance with the position of the movable member (54;60), through 
a coupling portion forced toward the first common gas passage (23) with 

a second common gas passage (36,37,38) connected with the pressure 
accumulating chamber (33), said coupling portion being constituted by a 

movable tubular sealing member (47) provided with an upper end coming 
into contact, selectively in accordance with the position of the 

movable member (54:60), with a portion of an outer surface of the 
movable member (54:60) at which the first common gas passage (23) opens, 

and in that said pressure receiving portion (51A) is 
fixed in the slider (50) to be positioned at the back of the barrel (2).  

 
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism 
according to claim 1, characterized by said second 

common gas passage (36,37,38) being provided with a valve portion (35a), 
a first passage portion (37) extending linearly from the pressure 

accumulating chamber (33) to the valve portion (35a) and a second 
passage portion (38) extending linearly from the valve portion (35A) to 

the coupling portion (47).
