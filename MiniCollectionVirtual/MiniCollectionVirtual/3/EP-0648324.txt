<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method of setting the upstand height of the studs (5) of an array (1) of studs used to form antenna panels is disclosed. The apparatus includes a transducer beam (10) having a row of spaced apart distance transducers (12). The apparatus also includes an actuator beam (22) having a row of spaced rotary actuators (26). The actuators (26) rotate the threaded studs (5) to raise or lower same until the corresponding transducer (12) indicates that the stud has achieved an intended height. Also disclosed is a method using an array of laser diodes (60), rather than the transducer beam (10), arranged at one end of the base plate (2) and an array of photodiodes (62) at the opposite end. Output (63) of the diodes (62) indicates the height of the studs (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an array of studs used to
form reflector antenna panels. Because such studs normally
take the form of bolts having threaded shanks, such an array
is often referred to as a "bed of bolts" by analogy to the bed
of nails known from the sleeping habits of Indian fakirs.The array of studs is used to form antenna panels and, in
particular, those panels which are curved in two dimensions.
Essentially the studs or bolts are each set to an individual
height which corresponds to the desired shape of the panel for
the location of the relevant bolt. Then the panel is formed
by pressing or otherwise conforming the sheet metal panel to
the surface determining by the heads, or tops, of the bolts.The prior procedure and apparatus used to create such
antenna panels is described in the paper "The Australia
Telescope Antennas: Development of High-Accuracy Low-Cost
Surface Panels" by B F Parsons and D E Yabsley published in
Octcber 1985 in the Proceedings of the IREE of Australia
(conference (IREECON 85) pp 716-719). A similar arrangement is
disclosed in US Patent No. 4,731,144 issued 15 March 1988 to
Kommineni et al, on which the two-part form of claims 1 and 6
is based. Both these documents disclose arrangements in which
the stud height of each stud is adjusted by manually turning
the bolt which forms the stud. This manual adjustment is a
very time consuming, and therefore expensive, procedure.It is the object of the present invention to provide both
a method and apparatus whereby the stud height setting 
procedure can be, at least to some extent, automated. The
purpose in doing so is two-fold, firstly to reduce the time
involved in the setting procedure, and secondly to increase the
accuracy of the set stud heights by the elimination of human
error.According to one aspect of the present invention there is
provided a setting apparatus for setting the upstand distance
of studs of an array of studs used to form antenna panels, said
array comprising a generally planar bed having a plurality of
studs extending substantially normally to the plane of said bed
and to opposite sides thereof, said studs being arranged in a
plurality of adjacent rows of substantially equal length with a
predetermined spacing between each pair of adjacent studs in a
row, each of said studs being of adjustable distance relative
to one side of said bed, said distance being adjustable by
manipulation of a portion of each said stud on the other side
bed, characterised in that said setting apparatus comprises two
beams
