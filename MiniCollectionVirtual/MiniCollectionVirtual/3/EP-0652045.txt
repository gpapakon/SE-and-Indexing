<ABSTRACT>
Novel alkyl-substituted aromatic polyethersulfone gas separation 
membranes and the process of using such membranes to separate one or more 

gases from a gaseous mixture is disclosed. The polyethersulfones are formed 
from aromatic alcohols of the formula 


 
where Z is independently alkyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, most 

preferably a tertiary butyl group, n is an integer from 1 to 4, preferably 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aromatic polyethersulfone gas separation
membranes and to a process for separating one or more gases from a gaseous,
mixture using such membranes. The polyethersulfones are derived from certain alkyl
substituted aromatic alcohols. The inventive gas separation membranes exhibit
exceptionally good permeation rates with good selectivity.Aromatic polyethersulfones, particularly polyethersulfones made
from aromatic alcohols are well known in the art. Gas separation membranes
made from polyethersulfones are also known in the art. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 5,071,448 describes gas separation membranes made from alkyl
substituted aromatic polyethersulfones. U.S. Patent No. 5,163,977 describes a
method of applying a non-ionic surfactant to polymeric gas separation
membranes, including membranes made from substituted aromatic
polyethersulfones. U.S. Patent No. 5,152,811 describes a gas separation
membrane made from aromatic polyethersulfones substituted with multiple
radicals such as hydrocarbon radicals.In addition, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,709,841; 3,855,122 and 4,625,000
describe sulfonated aromatic polyethersulfones which may be fabricated into
membranes which are useful for reverse osmosis processes.The polyethersulfone membrane compositions of the prior art,
although useful as gas separating membranes, not only suffer from the
disadvantages of having to satisfy specific structural constraints, but are also
difficult to fabricate into configurations such as hollow fiber membranes
because these compositions tend to be soluble in relatively few solvents.
Moreover, the membranes of the prior art tend to have relatively low flux. A
need therefore exists for fluid separation membranes that avoid the fabrication
and solubility problems of the prior art that also provide improved gas
separation properties.The present invention relates to certain substituted aromatic
polyethersulfone separation membranes which are particularly useful for 
separating gases and the process for using them. This class of membrane
materials compositionally contain units derived from certain alkyl substituted
biphenols, preferably a certain tertiary butyl substituted biphenol.
Membranes formed from this class of polyethersulfone materials exhibit
superior gas permeability and good selectivity. It is believed that the high
permeabilities of some gases from multicomponent mixtures is due to the
molecular free volume in the polymer which is created by the alkyl substituents
on the biphenol units.The present

A process for separating one or more gases from a gaseous mixture
comprising bringing said gaseous mixture into contact with the first side of the gas

separation membrane according to claim 1 in a manner to cause a portion of the
mixture to pass through the membrane to a permeate side, the resulting gas mixture

on the permeate side being enriched in one or more components over that of the mixture
on the first side.
