<ABSTRACT>
In order efficaciously to read-protect stored data, the integrated circuit includes an EEPROM type memory and a latch (L) protecting an area of the memory. The memory contains a read-protected password (PW) and the circuit includes means for releasing the latch (L) if the circuit receives a command to write to the address of the password from the same password (PW) encrypted. Application in particular to electronic systems and apparatus with a confidential code, such as car radios.

<CLAIMS>
Integrated circuit comprising an electrically modifiable
non-volatile memory (1), an associated control circuit (2) and

at least one volatile memory element (BL) producing a lock (L)
whose state when energised defines a locked state of the said

memory, the said integrated circuit being characterised in
that the said memory (1) has a first area (Z) which can be

protected in read mode by the said lock (L) and a second area
(S) which is always protected in read mode, protected in write

mode by the said lock (L) and containing at least one password
(PW, UPW) at a given address (ADx, ADu), in that the said

control circuit (2) comprises first means (7) for detecting an
instruction to write a data item addressed by the said given

address (ADx, ADu) whilst the said memory is locked and second
means (8, 10) for checking the compatibility of the said data

item with the said password (PW, UPW), the said compatibility
being different from identity, and in that, in the event of

compatibility, the said lock (L) is released.
Integrated circuit according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it includes decoding means (8), the said compatibility

check then consisting of decoding the said received data item
addressed by the said given address (ADx, ADu) and comparing

the said decoded data item with the said password (PW, UPW)
contained at the said given address (ADx, ADu).
Integrated circuit according to Claim 2, characterised in
that, when an instruction to write a data item addressed by

the said given address (ADx) is detected whilst the lock (L)
is released, the control circuit (2) activates the decoding of

the said data item and the writing of the said decoded data
item at the said given address (ADx).
Integrated circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the said second area (S) contains

several passwords (PW), (UPW), in that one of the said 
passwords (PW), hereinafter referred to as the manufacturer

password, can be protected in write mode independently of the
state of the lock (L).
Integrated circuit according to Claim 4, characterised in
that it contains a decoding key (MSK), in that the said memory

(1) has a third area (Y) freely accessible in read mode and
containing a system identification data item (ID) and in that

the said key (MSK) and the said manufacturer password (PW) are
functions of the said identification data item (ID).
Integrated circuit according to Claim 5, characterised in
that the said key (MSK) is a word of the same length as the

said passwords (PW, UPW) and in that the said coding or
decoding then consists of performing "exclusive OR" operations

on the bits of the same weight respectively of the key and of
the word to be coded or decoded.
Integrated circuit according to Claim 5 or 6,

characterised in that the said key (MSK) is contained in the
said second area (S), in that the said control circuit (2)

comprises third means (7) for detecting an instruction to
write a data item addressed by the address (ADm) of the said

key (MSK) whilst the said lock (L) is released and in that the
control circuit (2) activates the said decoding of the said

data item and the writing of the said decoded data item to the
said key address (ADm).
Integrated circuit according to one of Claims 5 to 7,
characterised in that the said key (MSK) can be protected in

write mode independently of the state of the lock (L).
Integrated circuit according to one of Claims 5 to 8,

characterised in that any instruction to write a data item
addressed by the address (ADx) of the manufacturer password

(PW) protected in write mode gives rise to a check on
compatibility between the said data item and the said 

manufacturer password and, in the event of non-compatibility,
the locking of the memory.
System including a processing unit (13) connected to a
user interface (14) and to an integrated circuit (15)

according to one of Claims 2 to 8, the said unit (13) being
capable of addressing the said integrated circuit (15) in read

mode and in write mode, characterised in that at least some of
the data necessary for the functioning of the said system are

contained in the said first area (Z) and in that the
processing unit (13) is programmed to take into account a

confidential code by means of the user interface (14) and to
instruct the said integrated circuit (15) to write the said

confidential code to the said given address (ADx, ADu).
System including a processing unit (13) and an integrated
circuit (15) according to Claim 9, the said unit being capable

of addressing the said integrated circuit (15) in read mode
and in write mode, characterised in that at least some of the

data necessary for the functioning of the said system are
contained in the said first area (Z), in that the manufacturer

password is protected in write mode, in that the processing
unit (13) comprises means for calculating the encoded

manufacturer password (PW) according to the said
identification data item (ID) read in the said third area (Y)

and in that the processing unit is programmed to instruct the
said integrated circuit (15) to write the said encoded

manufacturer password at the said address (ADx) of the
manufacturer password (PW).
