<ABSTRACT>
A floor/wall matting suitable for but not limited to animal stables, stalls, floats, etc. The floor/wall matting comprises a compressible support layer (40) covered with an upper cover layer of puncture resistant moisture impervious material (30). The matting (10) is formed with a plurality of apertures (50) sized to allow passage of animal waste or debris from the upper surface of the matting to a plurality of drainage channels (60) extending along an underside of the matting (10). The matting provides excellent physical and thermal insulation and hygienic conditions. The inventive floor/wall matting may be used in conjunction with a flushing system positioned adjacent the drainage channels to flush waste and debris which has passed through the apertures (50) of the matting out of the drainage channels (60) to a septic or severage outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to floor/wall coverings
which are suitable for, but not limited to, use with
animals, particularly for stalls, stables, boxes, pens or
floats in which animals are housed or transported.Most stables, stalls, boxes, pens or floats, etc, for
animal stock, eg, horses, pigs, cattle, are covered with
straw or similar particulate bedding material in order to
insulate the stock from the hard and usually cold floor
and to absorb waste and debris from the animals.To ensure cleanliness and prevent the spread of
disease in this conventional bedding material, replacement
material must continually be provided and the used
material cleaned out of the stables or stall and
disposed. Not only is the purchase and transportation of
conventional straw or other particulate bedding expensive,
particularly in remote arid areas, but the disposal of
large quantities of used bedding which is soaked with
animal waste is also costly.Further, conventional particulate bedding of straw,
wood shavings, sawdust, etc, is inadequate in terms of
protection and insulation from the stable floor and
walls. Once the conventional bedding has been placed in
the stall, it is usually scattered by the animal leaving
areas of the floor exposed. In addition, straw or other
particulate bedding tends to cause the animal to slip and
possibly fall when trying to move about the stall or
stable. This is particularly true for horses when trying
to stand up. The conventional bedding of straw, wood
shavings or sawdust bedding slides over the stable floor,
especially if it is wet. When the horse tries to stand,
it tends to get the bedding under its hooves, thereby
slipping and possibly injuring itself. In an attempt to combat these problems with
conventional bedding of straw, sawdust, wood shavings,
etc, it has previously been proposed to provide a
replacement bedding in the form of a matting either laid
down in sections or cut to the exact size of the stall or
stable.For example, US patent Nos 4129097 and 4502415
disclose a stable floor for animals comprising a
compressible sub layer of porous filamentary material
embedded in a top moisture impervious layer.While this matting provides a reasonable thermal
insulation from the stable floor, there is no mechanism
for removing animal waste or debris from the stable. The
matting of US patent Nos 4129097 and 4502415 requires that
all animal waste and debris, dirt, etc, be manually picked
up from the matting and taken away. Alternatively, the
mat itself may be entirely removed from the

<CLAIMS>
A floor/wall matting (10) having a plurality of apertures (50)
therethrough and extending from an upper surface of said matting to a plurality of

drainage channels (60), whereby
said matting is formed of an upper cover layer (30) of moisture impervious

puncture resistant material which forms said upper surface, and a compressible support
layer (40), wherein said apertures are sized to at least allow passage of animal fluid

waste from said upper surface through said upper cover layer and said compressible
support layer to said channels, and wherein said channels can be formed on the underside of

said support layer or formed in the wall (22) or floor (21) covered by the matting when
in situ.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said
drainage channels are formed on the underside of said support layer.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said
drainage channels are formed In the wall or floor to be covered by the matting.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that said support layer is constructed from a substantially moisture

impermeable closed cell foam.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in any one of the previous claims,
characterised in that said support layer is between 30 and 80mm thick.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said cover layer is constructed from a puncture resistant rubber

layer between 1 and 10mm thick.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said drainage channels are formed as a plurality of parallel

channels adapted to extend in a direction of fall of the floor or wall.
A floor/wall matting as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that said
closed cell foam is selected from ethylene-vinyl-acetate, ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer

(E.P.D.M.), styrene-butadiene-rubber (S.B.R.), polyisoprene, polychloroprene,
or polyethylene.
A floor/wall covering and cleaning assembly characterised by a
floor/wall matting as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 8 , and a flushing means

(70,71,72) adjacent the drainage channels of said floor/wall matting, said flushing
means being adapted to flush waste and debris which has passed through the apertures

of said floor/wall matting, out of said drainage channels.
A floor/wall covering and cleaning assembly as claimed in claim 9,
characterised in that said flushing means comprises a conduit (70) extending along an

edge of said floor/wall matting with a plurality of apertures (71) in said conduit aligned
with said drainage channels to force a flushing liquid along said channels. 
A floor/wall covering and cleaning assembly as claimed in claim 10,
characterised in that said flushing liquid is water.
A floor/wall covering and cleaning assembly as claimed in claim, 10 or
11, characterised in that said flushing liquid includes a disinfectant or bacteriocide.
A floor/wall covering and cleaning assembly as claimed in claimed in
any one of claims 9 to 12, characterised in that said conduit extends (72) along an upper

portions of a floor/wall to force liquid along said drainage channels to lower portions
below said upper portions.
