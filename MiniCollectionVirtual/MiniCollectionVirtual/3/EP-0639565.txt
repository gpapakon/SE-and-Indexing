the alicyclic ketoxime is represented by the following 

general formula: 

where R is a linear or branched alkylidene group 
containing from 3 to 20 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing 
a lactam from an alicyclic ketoxime in the presence of a 
lactim-O-sulphonic acid and a solvent. Such a process is known from GB-A-1301646. This 
publication describes a process in which in a first 
reaction step a cyclohexanone oxime/tin (IV) chloride 
complex in the presence of ε-caprolactim-O-sulphonic acid 
is converted to an ε-caprolactam/tin chloride complex. 
Subsequently, the complex so formed is separated and in a 
second reaction step contacted with cyclohexanone oxime, 
in which ε-caprolactam and a cyclohexanone oxime/tin 
chloride complex is formed. The ε-caprolactam is recovered 
and the cyclohexanone oxime/tin chloride complex is 
recirculated to the first reaction step. The net result of 
all these reactions is that cyclohexanone oxim (alicyclic 
ketoximes) are converted to free ε-caprolactam (lactam) in 
the presence of a cyclohexanone oxime/tin chloride complex 
(tin chloride complex). A disadvantage of this known process is that 
relatively many process steps are needed for preparing 
lactam. After each reaction step the desired product is 
separated off by, for instance, crystallization, which is 
not easy to accomplish for this group of reagents. In 
addition, the process is complicated by the introduction 
of tin(IV)chloride, a corrosive, moisture-sensitive 
reagent. The object of the invention is a simple process 
involving relatively few process steps for the preparation 
of a lactam starting from an alicyclic ketoxime in the 
presence of lactim-O-sulphonic acid.  This object is achieved in that the reaction is 
carried out in the presence of an acid cation exchanger. It has been found that, if the lactam is 
prepared by the process according to the invention, lactam 
can be prepared in a single process step starting from an 
alicyclic ketoxime (hereinafter shortly oxime). As a 
further advantage, the use of tin chloride and/or tin 
chloride complexes can be avoided. A third advantage is 
that the selectivity for lactam is higher than that 
attained in the process according to GB-A-1301646. The process according to the invention boviates 
the use off oleum for the preparation of lactam starting 
from an aliphatic ketoxime. This is advantageous because 
oleum is very corrosive and therefore needs a complicated 
handling. The rearrangement of an aliphatic ketoxime to 
lactam in oleum, also known as the Beckmann rearrangement, 
is a process commonly used in practice for the preparation 
of lactams, in particular for the preparation of
