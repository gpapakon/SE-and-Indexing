<ABSTRACT>
An image printer (1) includes a transport device 
for transporting standard (2) and auxiliary (3) photosensitive 

materials to a developing unit, an exposure system for 
exposing the photosensitive materials. The transport 

device includes a standard transport unit and an 
auxiliary transport unit. The standard transport 

means (T) transports to the developing unit the standard 
photosensitive material having sensitivity to a 

wavelength range of the three primary color components 
of light. The auxiliary transport (H) unit transports to 

the developing unit (D) the auxiliary photosensitive 
material (3) having sensitivity to a light wavelength 

range different from that of the standard 
photosensitive material (2). The exposure system includes 

a standard exposure unit (P) and an auxiliary exposure 
unit (I). The standard exposure (P) unit exposes the standard 

photosensitive material (2) at an exposing position of the 
standard transport unit , while the auxiliary exposure 

unit (I) exposes the auxiliary photosensitive material (3) at 
an exposing position of the auxiliary transport unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer, and more particularly to an image printer
having projection exposure means.As an image printer for exposing a film image
onto a photosensitive material, there is well-known
e.g. an image printer including a projection exposure
unit for projecting and exposing a film image onto a
photosensitive material and a developing unit for
developing the photosensitive material which has been
exposed at the projection exposure unit.The image printer of the above-described type
further includes transport means for transporting the
photosensitive material via an exposing position of
the projection exposure unit to the developing unit.
Then, while being transported by this transport means,
the photosensitive material undergoes a series of 
operations from the exposure of the film image to the
developing operation, so that the exposure of the film
image onto the photosensitive material may be carried
out in a convenient manner.Incidentally, the photosensitive material
processed by the above-described image printer is
adapted so as to have sensitivity to a wavelength
range of the three primary color components, i.e. red,
blue and green thereby to cover the entire wavelength
range of the visible light. Further, an exposure
light source for exposing the photosensitive material
having the above-described characteristics too is
constructed so as to irradiate white light beam having
the wavelength range of the respective three primary
color components of red, green and blue.On the other hand, as an exposure light source,
besides the above-described white light source, there
is also available a semiconductor light emitting
element light source such as a semiconductor laser or
a light emitting diode. These semiconductor light
emitting element light source is capable of an
exposure operation in the unit of pixel, so that this
light source may be used also for a so-called digital
processing of image information. Further, due to its
small light-emitting spot diameter, this type of light 
source is known to be capable of achieving a higher
resolution.In spite of the above, as the semiconductor light
emitting light source, there has been developed one
for irradiating red beam or infrared beam. However,
there has not yet been developed one capable or
obtaining a sufficient light amount in the wavelength
range of the blue component. Accordingly, it has been
impossible to employ such light source as an exposure
light source far the photosensitive materials employed
in the conventional
