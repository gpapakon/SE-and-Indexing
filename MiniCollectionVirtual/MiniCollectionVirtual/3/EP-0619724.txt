<ABSTRACT>
A biocompatible corneal inlay ring apparatus (3) for altering the curvature of the central optic zone (4) of the cornea (2) of the eye without intrusion into this optic zone (4), comprising a continuous ring (3) of a fixed diameter greater than that of the optic zone (4), of a thickness and geometry such that the curvature of the central optic zone is flattened to an extent appropriate to the refractive correction desired, and of a composition having a refractive index within about 2.0 % of that of the corneal tissues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention relates to corneal
implants to correct refractive errors in a patient.
More particularly, it relates to a corneal ring inlay
device for reversibly altering the curvature of the
central cornea without intruding on the central cornea,
which is particularly useful in correcting vision
defects.Deviations from the normal shape of the corneal
surface or the axial length of the eye produce errors
of refraction in the visual process. The eye in a
state of rest, without accommodation, focuses the image
of distant objects exactly on the retina. Myopia is
that refractive condition in which, with accommodation
completely relaxed, parallel rays are brought to focus
in front of the retina. One condition which commonly
causes myopia is when the length of the eye is greater
than normal. In this condition, rays converge or focus
in front of the retina in the vitreous of the eye.
When the rays reach the retina, they have diverged,
forming a circle of diffusion and consequently a 
blurred image. A concave lens is needed to correct the
focus of the eye for myopia.The classical treatment of these forms of
refractive error of the eye is with the use of
eyeglasses or contact lenses, both of which have well-known
disadvantages to the user. Recently, surgical
keratorefractive techniques have been developed to
change the refractive condition of the eye in order to
correct both hyperopic and myopic errors. The results
of such surgical procedures are not entirely
satisfactory. One such technique, referred to as
keratomileusis, was introduced by Barraquer of Columbia
in 1961. This technique involves grinding of a corneal
button into an appropriate shape to correct myopia or
hyperopia. It is often unsatisfactory, in part because
it often induces additional refractive errors to the
eye. These refractive errors are not compensatible, in
part because suturing can cause radial asymmetry of the
cornea that subsequently results in astigmatic error,
and in part because suturing causes scarring of the
corneal tissue, which generates scar tissue that is not
transparent to light.In a related surgical technique, keratophakia, a
donor cornea is ground into a convex lens and inserted
in the lamella in order to correct aphakic
hypermetropia. Radial keratotomy was introduced in
modern times (1972) by Fyodorov of the USSR to correct
astigmatism and myopia. Correction of astigmatism by
asymmetrically altering the corneal curvatures is prone
to producing aberrant refractive corrections, in part
because of suturing and in

<CLAIMS>
Inlay apparatus for flattening the curvature of the central 
optic zone of the cornea of the eye such that the apparatus does

not intrude into said optic zone, comprising a biocompatible
continuous corneal ring of a refractive index that is within 2%

of that of the adjacent corneal tissue, wherein said ring is of
a fixed diameter and has a thickness and cross-sectional geometry

adapted to effect a significant degree of corneal curvature
flattening, characterised in that said ring is thickest in the

middle and thinnest at the inner and outer edges of the ring
whereby said ring is adapted for insertion in the stroma of said

cornea through a circular cut through Bowman's membrane and the
superficial anterior stroma.
An apparatus of claim 1 wherein said material is a polymer.
An apparatus of claim 1, wherein said biocompatible ring is
permeable to fluids, nutrients and gases.
An apparatus of claim 3, wherein said material is a hydrogel.
An apparatus of claim 2, wherein said biocompatible ring
is substantially impermeable to fluids, nutrients and gases.
An apparatus of claim 1, wherein said cross-sectional
thickness and geometric shape of said ring raise the anterior

cornea peripherally, thereby reducing the curvature of the
central cornea, and thereby correcting for a myopic refractive

error in said eye.
An apparatus of claim 1, wherein the anterior surface of
said ring is of a cross-sectionally domed shape and the posterior

surface of said ring is substantially flat.
