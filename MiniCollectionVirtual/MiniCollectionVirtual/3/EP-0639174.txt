<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to an improved method for 
the continuous production of aromatic carboxylic acids 
by the liquid-phase oxidation of alkyl aromatic 
compounds with molecular oxygen in the presence of an 
oxidation catalyst or catalyst system. More 
particularly, this invention pertains to such oxidation 
processes carried out in a columnar reactor provided 
with means to inhibit entrainment of liquid and/or solid 
components of the reactor in the process off-gas. The liquid-phase oxidation of an alkyl aromatic 
compound to an aromatic carboxylic acid is a highly 
exothermic reaction commonly carried out in a vented, 
intimately-mixed, columnar reaction vessel. The 
oxidation process comprises continuously feeding 
separately or in admixture an alkyl aromatic compound, 
fresh and/or recycled solvent and catalyst components to 
the reaction vessel to which a molecular oxygen-containing 
gas also is fed, normally at or near the 
bottom of the vessel. The aromatic carboxylic acid 
product is sparingly soluble in the process solvent and 
is removed continuously through a lower exit port 
located at or near the base of the reactor as a slurry 
in the solvent which also contains soluble catalyst 
components. After separation of the aromatic carboxylic 
acid product, the solvent is returned to the reaction 
vessel. The oxygen-depleted process gas, e.g., containing 
up to about 9 volume percent oxygen, along with minor 
amounts of solvent decomposition products, is removed 
through an upper exit port located at or near the top of 
the reaction vessel. The heat of reaction is removed by 
the vaporization of the process solvent through the  
 
upper exit port. The solvent is condensed from the 
reactor off-gas by means of one or more condensers. A 
portion of the condensed solvent is subjected to a water 
removal step to remove a portion of the water of 
reaction from the production system and the water-depleted 
solvent is recycled to the reactor. The other 
portion of the condensed material is returned directly 
to the reaction vessel. The molecular oxygen-containing gas is continuously 
fed at or near the base of the columnar reaction vessel. 
The process gas rises through the liquid contents of the 
reactor resulting in vigorous agitation of the reaction 
mixture and providing intimate contact between the alkyl 
aromatic compound and the process solvent having 
dissolved therein the catalyst or catalyst components. The described production system can be utilized in 
the manufacture of aromatic

aromatic compound, the aqueous, monocarboxylic acid 

reaction medium having the oxidation catalyst 
dissolved therein and air; 
(2) continuously removing from the lower portion of the

acid reaction medium having the oxidation catalyst 

dissolved therein; 
(3) continuously removing from the upper portion of the 
reactor oxygen-depleted gas and vaporized aqueous, 

monocarboxylic acid reaction medium; 
(4) condensing from the stream of step (3) the aqueous, 
monocarboxylic acid reaction medium; and 
(5) returning at least a portion of the condensed, 
aqueous, monocarboxylic acid reaction medium 

obtained in step (4) in the form of a spray between 
the top of the gas/liquid contents of the reactor 

and the point within the reactor which the stream 
of step (3) is removed.

carboxylic acid is a benzenedicarboxylic acid, the alkyl 

aromatic compound is xylene and the monocarboxylic acid 
is acetic acid.
