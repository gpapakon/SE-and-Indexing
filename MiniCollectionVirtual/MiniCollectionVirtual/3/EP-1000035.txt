<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel 6-phenylphenanthridines which are used in the pharmaceutical industry
for the production of medicaments.Chem. Ber. 1939, 72, 675-677, J. Chem. Soc., 1956, 4280-4283 and J. Chem. Soc. (C), 1971, 1805
describes the synthesis of 6-phenylphenanthridines.WO 97 35854 A and WO 97 28131 A describe 6-phenylphenanthridines
which are useful as bronchial therapeutics.It has now been found that the novel 6-phenylphenanthridines which are described below in greater
detail have surprising and particularly advantageous propertiesThe invention thus relates to compounds of the formula I
