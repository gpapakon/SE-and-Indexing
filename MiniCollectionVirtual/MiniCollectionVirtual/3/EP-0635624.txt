<ABSTRACT>
A compression release system is provided in an 
engine having a main exhaust port (48) with an attached 

muffler (28). A muffler supporting boss (40) extends from 
the cylinder of the engine separate from the 

muffler mounting at the main exhaust port. A 
compression release port (44) extends through the boss (42). 

The muffler has two separate inlet apertures (56,58); one 

for the main exhaust port (56) and one for the 
compression release port (58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal combustion engines and, more
particularly, to a compression release system.U.S. Patent 4,252,092 discloses a compression release mechanism where
gases from a compression release port are transported to a muffler of the engine.
U.S. Patent 3,538,899 discloses a similar mechanism with a valve located in the
compression relief port. Other U.S. patents that relate to compression release
include: 4,619,228; 2,742,380; 5,054,441; 4,993,372; 4,312,308; 3,417,740;
2,023,048; 1,377,139; 4,791,892 and 5,134,976. A muffler with two inlet
apertures is also known in the prior art with one aperture connected to the main
exhaust port of a two stroke engine and the other aperture connected to a port at
the crankcase area of the engine. Other documents relating to engines usable in
power tools, lawn mowers and like purposes include GB 1,529,925; FR
2,525,687, Japanese Publication 1066415, and US Patent 5,127,372.Japanese Published Patent Application No. 64-87826 of Suzuki Motor Co.
Limited discloses an i.c. engine comprising a pair of cylinders 1a and 1b. Each
cylinder has a main exhaust port (8a or 8b) and small port (16a,16b) which also
allows for release of gases. The ports open into a common zone 9 as seen in
Figure 2 of the Japanese document.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided
an internal combustion engine having a compression release system and comprising all features of appended claim 1. In accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention, a power driven tool having an
internal combustion engine is provided, the engine
comprising a cylinder and a muffler. The cylinder
has a muffler mounting section. The muffler
mounting section includes a main exhaust port
extending through a first portion and a compression
release port extending through a second portion.
The first and second portions are spaced from each
other. The muffler is connected to the cylinder on
the first and second portions and includes a first
inlet aperture connected to the main exhaust port
and a second inlet aperture connected to the
compression release port.The foregoing aspects and other features of the
invention are explained in the following
description, taken in connection with the
accompanying drawings, wherein:Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a string trimmer
having an engine incorporating features of the
present invention.Fig. 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of the
cylinder, piston, and muffler of the engine shown

An internal combustion engine for a power driven tool, the engine having
a compression release system and bei
ng characterized in that it comprises:

a cylinder (24) having a muffler mounting section, the muffler mounting
section having a main exhaust port (32) extending through a first boss

(40) on the cylinder (24) and a separate compression release port (34)
extending through a second boss (42) on the cylinder (24), the first and

second bosses (40,42) being spaced from each other; and
a muffler (28) connected to the cylinder (24) on the first and second
bosses, the muffler having a first inlet aperture (56) connected to the main

exhaust port (32) and a separate second inlet aperture (58) connected to
the compression release port (34).
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1, in which the
cylinder has a main exhaust port (32), a first compression release port (34a), and

a second compression release port (34b), and in which all of these ports are
separate and spaced from each other, and extend through a wall of the cylinder

(24) into a single piston cylinder space.
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
compression release port is located about half-way between the top of an entrance

to the main exhaust port and an upper-most position of the top of a piston of the
engine.
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1 or 3, wherein the
compression release port has a first small section (52) at an entrance to the

compression release port and a second enlarged section (34) between the first
small section and the second inlet aperture of the muffler. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 4 wherein the second
enlarged section has a diameter about 30 percent larger than the diameter of the

first small section.
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 4 or 5 wherein the
length of the first small section is smaller than a diameter of the compression

release port (34).
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 4, 5 or 6 wherein the
length of the first small section is about half the size of the diameter of the

compression release port (34).
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any preceding claim wherein
the compression release port (34) is a straight channel through the second boss

(42) perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder (24) and generally parallel to the
main exhaust port (32) in the first boss (40).
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the displacement cross-sectional area of the engine and the cross-sectional area

of the compression release port are in a ratio of between about 850:1 and about
650:1.
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 9 wherein the said
ratio is about 750:1.
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 9 which comprises
multiple compression release ports for the cylinder.
