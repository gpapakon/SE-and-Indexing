<ABSTRACT>
A disk refiner for refining fiber material. The refiner comprises two opposed refining disks (3, 4), at least one of which is rotary and supported on a rotary shaft (5). The shaft (5) is mounted in a stand (1) via a bearing housing (6) with at least two bearings (11, 12, 13), a first one (11) for axial and prevailing radial forces, and a second one (12) primarily for radial forces. The bearings (11, 12, 13) are mounted rigidly each in its bearing seat (21, 22, 23), which is axially movable in the bearing housing (6), which in its turn is mounted stationary in the stand (1). Between the bearing seats (21, 22, 23) prestressing members (25, 26, 27) are arranged.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the refining 
of fiber material. The apparatus, a so-called disk refiner, 
comprises two opposed refining disks, at least one of 
which is rotary and supported on a rotary shaft. 
In a disk refiner of said type, the shaft is mounted in a stand via 
a bearing housing comprising at least two bearings, one of which is 
an axial/radial bearing for carrying axial forces from the refiner 
disk as well as prevailing radial forces, and one is an axial/radial 
bearing intended primarily to carry radial forces. A disk refiner equipped with such a bearing type is disclosed in SE-PS 
345 892. The bearing is relatively complicated, because it comprises 
a bearing housing for the bearings which is axially movable in the 
refiner stand. The bearing housing there must be extensive in length 
and include several slide surfaces to be fitted into the stand. The 
bearings, furthermore, must be axially prestressed in such a way, that 
at least one bearing must carry radial load and simultaneously must 
be axially movable in the bearing housing. This compromise renders a 
complicated and more expensive structure and deteriorates its functional 
efficiency. An apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed 
in SE-B-462572. The present invention offers a solution of the aforesaid problems. 
Due to the bearing housing being fixed in the stand, and the bearings 
rigidly mounted each in its axially movable bearing seat, and prestressing 
members arranged between the bearing seats, a simple and 
operationally reliable structure is obtained. The characterizing 
features of the invention are apparent from the attached claims. The invention is described in greater detail in the following, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings showing different embodiments 
of the invention. 
Figs. 1 and, respectively, 2 are cross-sections of embodiments comprising 
two and, respectively, three bearings. Figs. 3 and 4 are cross-sections of a detail in Fig. 2 of different 
designs. Both embodiments consist of a refiner with a stand 1 and a refiner 
housing 2, in which two opposed refining disks 3,4 are located. 
At these embodiments, a first refining disk 3 is rotary, and a second 
one 4 is stationary. The rotary refining disk 3 is supported on a 
rotary shaft 5, which is mounted in the stand 1 via a bearing housing 
6 and driven by a motor (not shown). The refining disks 3,4 are provided on their surfaces facing toward 
each other with refining elements 7,8, which between themselves define

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for refining fiber material, comprising two opposed 
refining disks (3,4), at least a first one (3) of which is rotary 

and supported on a rotary shaft (5), which is mounted in a stand (1) 
via a bearing housing (6) comprising at least two bearings (11,12,13), 

a first bearing (11) of which is an axial/radial bearing intended 
to carry axial forces from the first refining disk (3) as well as 

prevailing radial forces, and a second bearing (12) is an 
axial/radial bearing primarily intended to carry radial forces, 


characterized in
 that the bearings (11,12,13) are 
rigidly mounted each in its bearing seat (21,22,23) so that each bearing 

seat is axially movable in the bearing housing (6), which in its 
turn is mounted stationary in the stand (1), and that prestressing 

members (25,26,27) are arranged between the bearing seats (21,22,23). 
Apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that a third bearing (13) for carrying only axial forces from the 

refining disk (3) is located in a third bearing seat (23) between 
the first and second bearing (11,12) and, respectively, bearing seat 

(21,22). 
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in
 that each bearing seat (21,22,23) is capable to be moved axially 
by means of an annular hydraulic cylinder (31,32,33), which is connected 

to a conduit (51,52,53) for hydraulic medium and co-operates with 
a ring piston (41,42,43) rigidly connected to the bearing housing (6). 
Apparatus as defined in claim 3 comprising three bearings 
(11,12,13) and, respectively, bearing seats (21,22,23), 
characterized 
in
 that the annular hydraulic cylinders (31,33) 
in the first and, respectively, third bearing seat (21,23) are dimensioned 

for distributing the axial forces between the first and, 
respectively, third bearing (11,13).  

 
Apparatus as defined in claim 2, 
characterized in
 
that one or more additional bearings for carrying only axial forces 

from the refining disk (3) are located each in its bearing seat 

between the first and second bearing (11,12) and, respectively, 
bearing seat (21,22). 
Apparatus as defined in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in
 that each prestressing member 
(25,26,27) is formed with a piston/cylinder unit, and the prestressing
