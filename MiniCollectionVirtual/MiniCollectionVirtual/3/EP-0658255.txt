<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing spherical particles including the steps of: melting together a first material and a second material which are incompatible; applying shear to the melted mixture to create an emulsion of the first material and second materials whereby finely divided spherical blobs of the first material are dispersed in the other material; cooling the dispersion to solidify at least the first material; and removing the second material from the cooled dispersion to yield spherical particles of the first material, preferably by dissolving the second material in a solvent in which the first material is not soluble.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of
small particles, especially in the range of 1-10 micrometers
in diameter. Such particles are especially useful for use in
liquid or powder toners.Toner materials, whether for liquid or powder toner
development, should be tough, abrasion resistant, elastic
and have proper electrical properties.Many methods for the production of micron sized
particles for use in liquid and powder toner compositions
are known. These methods can be divided into a number of
classes.One type of process produces particles by dissolving a
monomer or polymer or a plurality of monomers and/or
polymers in a solvent, producing a polymerization reaction
to form an insoluble polymer while stirring the
solution/dispersion such that the polymer is precipitated as
small particles. Example of this type of process are
described in U.S. Patents 3,779,924, 4,996,265.In a second type of process, a polymer or other
material is dissolved in a solvent. The solution is combined
with a solvent in which the polymer is insoluble and as a
result the polymer precipitates out of the solution as small
particles. The mixture is stirred during the process to aid
in the formation of the particles. Examples of this type of
process type are shown in U.S. Patents 3,679,586, 3,718,593,
3,682,825.In a third production process the particles are
produced by crushing or otherwise fracturing a polymer
material and then classifying the particles according to
size.In a fourth production process especially suitable for
producing liquid toner, polymer particles are wet ground to
produce particles. Examples of such processes are found in
U.S. Patent 4,794,651.In a fifth process the polymer is dissolved in a 
solvent (water or an other solvent) which is then spray
dried to produce particles. The particle sizes produced by
this process are often too large for toner.U.S. Patent 4,158,634 describes a sixth process a
polymer material is dissolved at an elevated temperature in
a solvent which is normally solid (at room temperature). The
solution is cooled and solidifies. The now solid solvent is
then dissolved in a second, liquid (at room temperature)
solvent leaving the polymer. The polymer is brushed through
a screen to form a polymer powder.U.S. Patent 3,586,654 describes a seventh method for
producing toner particles in which a polymer is melted in
super-heated water (under high pressure) and shear is
supplied to form blobs of melted polymer dispersed in the
water. The dispersion is cooled to solidify the polymer as
round

melting together a first solid material and a second solid
material which are immiscible, both said materials being

solids at room temperature;
applying shear to the resulting melted mixture of the first
material and the second material to create an emulsion of

the first material and second material in which finely
divided spherical blobs of the first material are dispersed

in the second material;
cooling the dispersion to solidify at least the first
material; and
removing the second material from the cooled dispersion
to yield spherical particles of the first material.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the step of
removing comprises the step of dissolving the second

material in a solvent in which the first material is not
soluble.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
step of cooling includes cooling both the first and second

materials sufficiently to form solids before removing the
second material.
A method according to any of the preceding claims
wherein the second material is a polymer material.
A method according to any of the previous claims
wherein the second material is a caramel.
A method according to any of the previous claims
wherein the first material comprises a thermoplastic polymer

suitable for use in a toner.
A method according to any of the previous claims
wherein the second material is water soluble and the solvent

is water. 
A method according to any of the previous claims
wherein the first and second materials have viscosities, at

the temperature at which the step of shearing is performed,
which enable the transfer of sufficient shear to the first

material to cause it to form blobs of the required size.
A method according to any of the previous claims
wherein the two materials have a ratio of viscosities at the

temperature of the shearing step which is less than 5:1.
A method according to claim 9 wherein the ratio is less
than 2:1.
A method according to any of the previous claims and
including the step of adding a powdered insoluble material

into the melted emulsion before the step of shearing is
completed, whereby the powder adheres to the blobs and

thereby coats the resulting particles.
A method according to any of the previous claims
wherein the first material is a pigmented polymer.
