<ABSTRACT>
The method concerns insert-cast welding of fine-pearlitic rails by pouring aluminothermally produced steel into a mould surrounding both rail ends. It is characterised by the following facts: (a) after the joint has cooled down, the running track and adjoining regions are shock-heated from the top by means of a welding torch for a period of 50 to 150 seconds; (b) the torch is supplied with oxygen at least at 10000 litres/hr and with propane or acetylene at 3500 litres/hr; and (c) the torch distance (a) measured in mm is equal to 0.1-1 times the numerical value of the wt. in kg/m of the rail.

Process for the intermediate cast welding of 

finely perlitic rails (13) by pouring aluminothermically 
produced steel into a casting mould surrounding the two 

ends of the rail, characterized in that, after the weld 
(10) has cooled, the wheel-contact surface of the weld 

(10) and the adjoining heat-affected zones are heated in 
a shock-like manner from above by means of a torch (11) 

for a period of 50 to 150 seconds, the torch (11) being 
supplied with in each case at least 10,000 l/hour of 

oxygen and 3500 l/hour of propane or acetylene, and the 
combustion surface of the torch head being positioned at 

a distance from the wheel-contact surface (8) of the weld 
and of the thermal influence zones equal to a value, 

measured in mm, corresponding to 0.1 to 1 times the 
numerical value of the weight per metre of the rail used, 

measured in kg. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that 80 to 120 seconds is chosen as the period for 

heating in the case of rails with a weight per metre of 
45 to 70 kg, and the combustion surface of the torch head 

(11) is positioned at a distance equal to a value, 
measured in mm, corresponding to 0.3 to 0.7 times the 

numerical value of the weight per metre of the rail, 
measured in kg.
