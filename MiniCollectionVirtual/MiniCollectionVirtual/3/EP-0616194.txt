<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image pickup
device. More specifically the invention relates to a
solid image pickup device for performing optical
measurement by determining the value of a desired light
component from light comprising the desired component and
noise components.In recent years, with the spread of image
processing techniques, various kinds of image pickup
devices as a main device having a photoelectric
conversion function have been developed. A charge
transfer device represented by a CCD or a BBD, a MOS type
image pickup device, and a position sensitive detector
are examples of the image pickup devices.In a case that only a certain object is intended to
be taken by the image pickup device, not only light from
the certain object but also light from its background are
incident on the photosensitive unit, so that the light
from the background is included in the image signal as
noise components. Therefore, it is a problem that the 
real image signal of the certain object cannot be
obtained.The conventional solid image pickup device employs
some technique to eliminate noise components including
offset components and noise components generated by the
photosensitive unit itself (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
59-142412 (142412/1984)). However, it is not practical
to use as the solid image pickup device.JP 62237411 describes an automatic focusing device
which obtains distance measuring information by repeating
light emission and non-light emission and correcting an
integrated value of an integrating part at the time of
the light emission by an integrated value of an
integrating part at the time of the non-light emission.
JP 62245103 describes a signal processing circuit in
which light is projected on to a PSD to calculate a
current and subsequently a voltage and, further, a
current and a voltage are calculated without projecting
light to calculate a voltage difference.The present invention aims to provide an image
pickup device with simple construction which can perform
measurement accurately. According to the present
invention there is provided an image pickup device for
performing optical measurement by determining the value 
of a desired light component from light comprising the
desired component and noise components, the image pickup
device comprising: a photosensitive unit for converting
light incident thereon into an electrical signal
representative thereof; a first integrator for
integrating over a period of time the signal from the
photosensitive unit to produce a first signal at a
