<ABSTRACT>
A chroma noise reduction device comprises an 1H 
delay element (13), first and second variable delay 

units (15, 18), variable amplifier (16), first and 
second adder (12, 21) amplitude restricting circuit, 

first and second subtracters (11, 22) and first, second 
and third phase detectors (19, 20 and 23). The first 

phase detector (19) compares the phases of a delay 
signal (V₁) of a second variable delay unit (18) and 

chroma signal (V
i
) supplied to the second variable delay 
unit and controls the second variable delay circuit (18) 

to have the phase of the delay signal (V₁) 90°-delayed 
relative to the chroma signal (V
i
). The second phase 
detector (20) compares the phases of the delay signal 

(V₁) and output signal (V₂) of the variable amplifier 
(16) and controls the phase of the first variable delay 

unit (15) in response to a result of comparison. The 
third phase detector (23) compares the phases of a sum 

signal (V₃) of the delay signal (V₁) and output signal 
(V₂) of the variable amplifier (16) and a difference 

signal (V₄) of the delay signal (V₂) and output signal 
(V₂) of variable amplifier (16) and controls the 

amplitude of the variable amplifier (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chroma noise
reduction device for eliminating noise components
from a chroma signal of a television, VTR, etc., and, in
more particular, a chroma noise reduction device for
automatically adjusting the phase and amplitude of a
delay signal obtained from an 1H delay element, such as
a CDD, etc.Conventionally, a chroma noise reduction device
for television, VTR, etc., is as shown, for example, in
FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, a chroma signal vi supplied from a
final stage of a chroma circuit is fed to one input terminal
of each of a subtracter 11 and adder 12. The output
of the subtracter 11 is supplied to a CCD 13 serving
as a 1H delay circuit for delaying the signal by a 1
horizontal period. The 1H delay signal from CCD 13 is
supplied to a variable amplifier 16 through a filter
circuit 14 and variable delay unit 15, the filter circuit
14 being used to delay a clock signal, etc., contained
in the output signal of CCD 13. An output signal
V2 of the variable amplifier 16 is fed back to the other
input terminal of the adder 12. The adder 12 adds
together the input signal Vi and one horizontal period-prior
signal V2 which is output from the variable
amplifier 16. A result of addition is supplied to the
other input terminal of the subtracter 11 through a
limiter 17 for amplitude limitation. The output signal 
of the limiter 17 is subtracted from the input signal Vi
by virtue of the subtracter and the output signal V0 is
supplied to an YC addition circuit, not shown, and to
CCD 13.CCD 13, filter circuit 14, variable delay unit 15
and variable amplifier 16 constitute external component
parts. The variable delay unit 15 and variable
amplifier 16 are manually adjustable, by an operation
of a volume, at the phase and amplitude of the 1H delay
signal.In the arrangement above, it is necessary that, in
order to obtain a desired characteristic, exact matching
be achieved in amplitude and phase between the input
signal Vi and the 1H delay signal. Conventionally, the
phase delay time of the variable delay unit 15 and
amplitude of the variable amplifier 16 had been adjusted
while monitoring the output signal of the adder 12.In the chroma noise reduction device thus arranged,
however, more external component parts and more
manufacturing steps and more occupation areas are
required upon the manufacture of a printed circuit
board, etc. Further, the manufacturing cost is also
higher. Since, during the portion of the manufacturing
process, the operator has to manually adjust the variable
delay unit 15
