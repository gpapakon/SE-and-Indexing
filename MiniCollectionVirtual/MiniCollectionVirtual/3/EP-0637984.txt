<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to filter
cartridges, particularly, heaters for filter cartridge
configurations used in trap apparatuses for filtering
particulates from exhaust gases of usually a diesel
engine.A currently popular method of regenerating
diesel particulate filters is to use electric resistance
heaters. These heaters use the electrical power supply
of the engine alternator and batteries to raise the
temperature of the filtered particulate matter so that
combustion can take place. Large ceramic filters have a
relatively high loading capacity and can filter for long
periods of time before regeneration is needed. These
filters can be regenerated electrically by heating a
small portion of the massive filter, and then allowing
the regeneration to propagate itself. Larger mass, slow
warm-up heater designs can be used because the
regeneration duty cycle is very low, and the ratio of
heater on-time to loading time is also low. These
filters are expensive, and are only cost justified for
heavy duty applications.Diesel filter design concepts for lighter duty
applications are moving toward lower cost, lighter
weight, modular filter cartridges. These filter
cartridges often use a fibrous material that cannot
retain enough heat to support self-propagated
regenerations. They do not have as much filter media
area as ceramic filters, so they require much more
frequent regeneration. As such, these filter cartridges
require an electric resistance heater that can warm-up
very quickly and transfer energy efficiently to the
media and the trapped particulate matter. As a
consequence, the heater must have exposed elements, must
be light weight, must have high surface area for maximum 
heat transfer, and must be integrated closely with the
media and other support structure to enhance heat
transfer. Filter cartridge heaters must be partially
open to allow unrestricted air flow, and must be able to
withstand the extreme thermal stresses associated with
close structural contact with other support members.
Furthermore, because of the higher regeneration duty
cycle, filter cartridge heaters must withstand many
thousands of warm-up/cool-down cycles.Modular filter cartridge design and a multitude
of different applications for cartridges require a
variety of heater configurations in order to meet power
and physical space limitations. Existing heater designs
are known by the terms: cal-rod, ribbon, coil, and
expanded metal. A cal-rod is essentially an insulative
rod containing resistance wire. The rod can be straight

<CLAIMS>
A filter cartridge (22, 22') for a trap apparatus
(14) for filtering particulates from exhaust gases of an

engine (12)whereby said trap apparatus has an electrical
power source, said cartridge including a longitudinally-extending

tubular heating element (34, 34') which is in
electrical
 contact at first and second ends with means (48,
48') for receiving electrical energization from said power

source, said cartridge further including tubular means (60,
60') for filtering particulates, 
characterized
 in that said
heating element includes a plurality of slots (80) aligned

in transverse, staggered rows, such that said heating
element (34) has an average transverse width between

adjacent slots in adjacent rows and has a bridge (84)
between consecutive slots in the same row with an average

bridge width of about twice the average transverse width so
that said heating element has conducting paths between the

first and second ends which have a relatively uniform width
and so that said heating element has structural pathways

with significant non-zero transverse force resisting
vectors and near-zero longitudinal force resisting vectors,

said cartridge (22, 22') having means (52, 62) for
connecting said heating element to a support member (32,

32') to maintain longitudinal length of said heating
element approximately constant during heating growth and

non-heating contraction.
Cartridge according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that said slots (80) include a first pair of facing,

parallel, transverse edges.
Cartridge according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that said slots (80) further include a second pair of

facing, equally radiused edges. 
Cartridge according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in
that said first and second pairs form an endless,

continuous perimeter.
Cartridge according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that said slots (80) have a length to width ratio of at

least 2.
Cartridge according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that said connecting means include a lip (74) extending

transversally from said support member (32') and a collar
(72) extending transversally from said heating element,

said connecting means further including an insulating ring
(70) fitting between said lip (74) and said collar (72).
