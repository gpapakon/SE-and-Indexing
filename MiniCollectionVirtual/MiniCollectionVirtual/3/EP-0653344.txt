<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chassis (1) of the beam chassis type for a motor vehicle comprising a central beam (4), characterised in that it further comprises at least one elongate member (6, 8) integral with the said central beam (4) and extending substantially parallel to the said central beam (4), and in that the end parts (6a, 8a, 6b, 8b) of the said elongate member (6, 8) extend beyond the ends (4a, 4b) of the said central beam (4) to the front and to the rear of the said chassis (1) and are designed to deform and absorb energy in the event of a collision.

Chassis of the beam type for motor vehicle, 
comprising a central beam (4), which is intended to 

support the passenger space of the vehicle and to define 
the length of the theoretically rigid part of the chassis 

(1) above which the occupants of the vehicle are situated, 
and at least one elongated member (6, 8) attached to the 

central beam (4) and extending substantially parallel to 
said central beam (4), characterized in that the end 

portions (6a, 6b, 8a, 8b) of said elongated member (6, 8) 
extend beyond the ends (4a, 4b) of the central beam (4) at 

the front and the rear of said chassis (1) and are 
arranged to be deformed and to absorb energy in case of a 

collision. 
Chassis according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises two elongated members (6, 8), extending 

on either side of the central beam (4). 
Chassis according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it comprises, at each end of the central beam (4) 

support means (10a, 10b) attached to the central beam (4) 
and extending substantially perpendicular to the 

longitudinal direction of this central beam (4), in that 
each of said elongated members (6, 8) is attached to said 

support means (10a, 10b) and in that said end portions 
(6a, 6b, 8a, 8b) of said elongated members extend into the 

support means (10a, 10b) and beyond. 
Chassis according to claim 3, characterized in 
that each of said support means (10a, 10b) comprises two 

plates (14a, 16a, 14b, 16b) substantially parallel, one of 
said plates (14a, 14b) being attached to one end (4a, 4b) 

of the central beam (4) and being separated from the other 
(16a, 16b) of said plates by spacers (18a, 18b). 
Chassis according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said elongated members (6, 8) are 

formed by hollow beams. 
Chassis according to claim 5, characterized in 
that said hollow beams have a circular cross-section.  

 
Chassis according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each of said end portions (6a, 8a, 

6b, 8b) comprises means for initiating deformation in the 
longitudinal direction (OX) of the chassis. 
Chassis according to claim 4, characterized in 
that said elongated organs (6, 8) are fixed onto the 

plates (14a, 16a, 14b, 16b) by fastening means (34). 
Chassis according to claim 4 for a vehicle 
comprising front and rear wheels (R) as well as suspension 

means (44) and absorption means (46) used with said wheels 
(R), characterized in that said suspension means (44) and 

said absorption means (46) used with said front wheels and 
used with said rear wheels are respectively mounted on a 

first (14a, 14b) and the second (16a, 16b) of said pairs 
of plates (14a, 14b, 16a, 16b). 
Chassis according to claim 9, characterized in 
that one of the pairs (14a, 16a) of plates forms a cradle 

intended to receive the propulsion means. 
Chassis according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the central beam (4) has the 

configuration of a hollow beam having a rectangular cross-section, 
the major axis of said rectangular cross-section 

extending perpendicular to the plane of the chassis. 
Chassis according to one of the preceding claims 
intended to equip an electrically propelled vehicle 

comprising batteries, characterized in that the central 
beam (4) forms means for housing said batteries. 
Chassis according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the central beam (4), the elongated 

members (6, 8) and the support means (10a, 10b), when the 
latter are present, are made of aluminium or of an 

aluminium alloy.
