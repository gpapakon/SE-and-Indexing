<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for effectively and 
efficiently interconnecting a first rigid circuit with 

a second rigid circuit. The interconnected circuit 
system includes, in addition to the first and second 

circuits, a compressive conductive member. The 
compressive conductive member has a first end for 

interconnecting engagement with the first circuit and a 
second end for interconnecting engagement with the 

second circuit. The first end of the compressive 
conductive member is connected with the first circuit 

and the second end of the compressive conductive member 
with the second circuit thereby connecting the first 

circuit to the second circuit to form a completed 
electrical circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods and 
systems for producing electrically interconnected 
circuits, and more particularly to electrically 
interconnected circuits which are especially adapted 
for making external electrical connections to thermal 
ink jet printheads. It is known to provide heater resistors on a 
common substrate, such as silicon, and employ these 
resistors to transfer thermal energy to corresponding 
adjacent ink reservoirs during a thermal ink jet 
printing operation in the manufacture of thin film 
resistors substrates for thermal ink jet printheads. 
This thermal energy will cause the ink in the 
reservoirs to be heated to boiling and thereby be 
ejected through an orifice in an adjacent nozzle plate 
from which it is directed onto a print medium. These 
heater resistors are electrically pulsed during such 
operation by current applied thereto via conductive 
traces formed on top of the silicon substrates and 
insulated therefrom by an intermediate dielectric 
layer. The formation of an intermediate dielectric  
 
layer, the formation of the resistive layer for the 
heater resistors, and the aluminum evaporation of 
sputtering process for forming electrical patterns of 
conductive trace material to the heater resistors are 
all well known in the art and therefore are not 
described in further detail herein. The processes used 
in the fabrication of thermal ink jet printheads are 
discussed in the Hewlett Packard Journal, Volume 36, 
Number 5, May 1985 ("HP Journal Article"), which is 
incorporated herein by reference. Hewlett Packard 
Corporation is the assignee of the entire right, title 
and interest in the subject patent application. Electrical connections are provided between 
external pulse drive circuits and the conductive traces 
on the thermal ink jet printhead using flexible or 
"flex" circuits to make removable pressure contacts to 
certain conductive terminal pads on thin film resistor 
printhead substrates or to tape automated bonding (TAB) 
circuits. These electrical connections are facilitated 
by applying pressure to the flexible circuit so that 
the electrical leads therein make good electrical 
connection with corresponding mating pads on the thin 
film resistor printhead substrate. These flexible 
circuit generally comprise photolithographically 
defined conductive patterns formed by various etching 
processes carried out on a thin flexible insulating 
substrate member. The electrical contact locations on 
the flex circuit will be raised slightly in a
