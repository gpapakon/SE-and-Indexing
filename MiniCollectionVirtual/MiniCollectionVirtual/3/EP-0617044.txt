<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a cyclopentadienyl group-containing 
silicon compound or a cyclopentadienyl group-containing 

germanium compound, comprises reacting (i) a lithium, sodium 
or potassium salt of a cyclopentadiene derivative with (ii) 

a silicon halide compound or a germanium halide compound in 
the presence of a cyanide or a thiocyanate. The cyanide or 

the thiocyanate is preferably a copper salt. According to 
the process of the invention, a cyclopentadienyl 

group-containing silicon compound or a cyclopentadienyl 
group-containing germanium compound, which is very useful 

for the preparation of a metallocene complex catalyst 
component, can be prepared in a high yield for a short 

period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing a cyclopentadienyl group-containing silicon
compound or a cyclopentadienyl group-containing germanium
compound.A metallocene complex catalyst containing a
cyclopentadienyl group as a ligand has been paid much
attention in recent years as a novel catalyst for olefin
polymerization. Of such cyclopentadienyl group ligands, a
cyclopentadienyl group-containing silicon compound and a
cyclopentadienyl group-containing germanium compound have
been particularly paid attention because they are able to
form a chiral and stereorigid metallocene complex when they
coordinate to a central metal (e.g., zirconium).
Especially, a zirconocene complex having such ligand is
known as an important catalyst component capable of
producing an olefin polymer with a high polymerization
activity, as described in European Patent Application No.
129,368. Further, the metallocene complex having such ligand is
also useful as a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction or a
hydrogenation reaction.The cyclopentadienyl group-containing silicon compound
(or cyclopentadienyl group-containing germanium compound)
employable as a ligand of the metallocene complex is
generally prepared by causing a lithium, sodium or
potassium salt of cyclopentadiene derivative to react with
a silicon halide compound (or a germanium halide compound),
as described in "Organometallics" 3 1470 (1984), "Chem.
Berichte" 119 1750 (1986), "J. Am. Chem. Soc." 112 9558
(1990), Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications No.
221285/1990 (EP-A-376 154), No. 21607/1991 (EP-A-399 348), No. 268307/1992 and No.
368308/1992, EP 0549900A1, EP 0545303Al, EP 0537686Al, EP
0530647Al, EP 0574597A1 and EP 0576970A1.In detail, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
No. 221285/1990 (EP-A-376 154) for example, a solution of an indenyl
lithium salt prepared from indene and n-butyllithium is
slowly added to a dimethyldichlorosilane solution, and they
are reacted with each other overnight to obtain
dimethyldi(1-indenyl)silane in a 71 % yield. In Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 268307/1992, dimethyldi(2-methyl-1-indenyl)silane
is obtained in a 16 % yield in a
manner similar to the above.In "Chem. Berichte" 119 1750 (1986), a solution
containing 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl lithium and
dimethyldichlorosilane is heated for 5 days to obtain 
dimethylbis(2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)silane in a
65 % yield.In any of the conventional processes as described
above, however, the reaction must be carried out for a long
period of
