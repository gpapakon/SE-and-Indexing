<ABSTRACT>
A method for amplification of a nucleic acid strand in 

a test sample. The method includes contacting the nucleic 
acid strand from the test sample simultaneously with at 

least three oligonucleotide primers. At least one primer 
is a promoter-primer, and at least one other primer is 

complementary to the nucleic acid strand, and one other 
primer is complementary to a strand complementary to the 

nucleic acid strand. The method further includes contacting 
the nucleic acid strand and primers with one or more 

proteins having RNA-directed and/or DNA-directed DNA polymerase 
activities, an RNA polymerase activity, and an 

RNAse H activity under primer-extension conditions to 
allow amplification of a target region in the nucleic acid 

strand at essentially constant temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to amplification of nucleic
acid strands using a DNA polymerase and an RNA polymerase
at essentially constant temperature.The ability to detect specific nucleic acid sequences
has afforded many practical benefits in areas such as
genetic research, clinical diagnostic testing, forensic
sciences, archaeology, etc. In many cases, the sequence
of interest might be present at a level much too low to
detect directly, even using probes with very high
specific activity labels. In recent years, strategies
have been devised for efficiently generating new copies of
target sequences, including very powerful exponential
amplification methods, which make it easier to accurately
detect the presence of very low target levels.One such method is the polymerase chain reaction
(Mullis et al., U.S. Patent 4,683,202) in which a reaction
mix of primers, substrates, DNA polymerase and analyte
nucleic acid is subjected to n cycles of heating to a
temperature sufficient for denaturing double-stranded
nucleic acids and cooling to a temperature at which primer
annealing and extension can occur. This reaction is well
understood to have a maximum amplification factor of 2n
since each strand of a target sequence can be copied into
(at most) one new complementary strand during each cycle.The performance of target-specific amplification has
been augmented by performing two or more successive
amplification reactions in which the target region defined.
by the primers used in the subsequent rounds is contained
within the target amplicon generated by primers used in
the previous round. Even if the amplification of a
desired target is inefficient in the first round because 
of co-amplification of non-target sequences, the target
amplicons that are generated should have a selective
advantage for further amplification by the next primer set
since non-target amplicons are usually not more effective
templates for further amplification by the nested primer
set than other non-target sequences present. This strategy
has been used to improve the ability of amplification
methods such as PCR (Conway et al.,J. Acquired Immune
Def. Syndromes 3:1059 (1990); Matsumoto et al., J. Virol.
64:5290 (1990); Garson et al.,Lancet 336:1022 (1990); and
NASBA (Kievits et al.,J. Virol. Methods 35:273 (1991)) to
detect very low target levels.The amplification method of Kacian et al. as disclosed
in WO 91101384 depends on multiple enzyme activities (i.e.,
including RNA polymerase, DNA-directed DNA polymerase,
RNA-directed DNA polymerase, and
