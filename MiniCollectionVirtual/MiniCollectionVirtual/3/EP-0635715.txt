<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a system intended to create the same instantaneous pressure in two vessels, each filled with a given medium, the first vessel comprising at least one inlet channel and at least one outlet channel for the given medium, the second vessel comprising at least one outlet channel and means for opening and closing the said channels. - The system according to the invention furthermore comprises at least one capillary for connecting together each vessel, each capillary is intended in particular to transmit a variation of pressure in the first vessel to the second vessel instantaneously.

<CLAIMS>
A system designed to create a same
instantaneous pressure between two tanks, each filled

with a given medium, the first tank (1) having at least
one inlet passage (2) and at least one outlet passage

(3) for the given medium, the second tank (4) having at
least one outlet passage (5), and means for opening and

closing said passages, characterised in that it has at
least one linking capillary (7) between each tank,

specifically designed to transmit instantaneously any
variation in pressure from the first tank (1) to the

second tank (4).
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that the first tank (1) is a measurement tank in

which the mobile phase to be analysed is circulated and
the second tank is a tank containing a reference medium

which is kept in a static state during each

measurement.
A system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the linking

capillary or capillaries (7) can be used to fill the
second tank (4).
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that the second tank (4) has at

least one inlet passage (6) in addition.
Use of the system as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims to measure refractive indices in

two different media.
Use as claimed in claim 5 for the purposes of
(high-performance liquid) chromatography.
Use of the system as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 4 for measuring the absorption of ultraviolet

light by the media present in each tank.
Use of the system as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 4 to measure the absorption of visible 

light by the media present in each tank.
