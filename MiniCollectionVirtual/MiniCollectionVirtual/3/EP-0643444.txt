<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical contact with elastic return, intended to be arranged at the end of an electrical cable (1) or the like. The contact according to the invention comprises a contact head (2) fastened to the end of at least one leaf spring (3) whose other end (3d), called the fixing end, is provided so as to be fixed in an apparatus (16) to be equipped, and it is particularly noteworthy in that a zone (1') of the cable (1), called the retention zone, is immobilised together with the leaf spring (3) close to the end for fixing the latter, while at least one conductor (12) is provided for ensuring electrical connection between the said contact head (2) and the zone (1') for retaining the cable in such a way that the leaf spring makes it possible to position the contact head and to enable it to bend elastically, transversely to the said leaf spring.
