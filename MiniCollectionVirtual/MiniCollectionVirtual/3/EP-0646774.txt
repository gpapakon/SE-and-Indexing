<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided for compensating for phase shift occurring in a 
signal being returned from a remote sensor (1). The apparatus comprises 

an excitation generator (30) which supplies an excitation signal to the 
remote sensor (1). The return signal from the sensor (1) is supplied via 

an over-sampling analogue-to-digital converter (22, 23) to a phase splitter 
(24) which divides the return signal into its real or in-phase component 

and its imaginary or quadrature component. The amplitude of the 
quadrature component is compared with zero by a comparator (28) and 

via a control circuit (29) controls the phase shift (25) between the 
excitation signal from the generator (30) and the return signal. The phase 

of the excitation signal is controlled so that the quadrature component is 
zero and the real component therefore represents the amplitude of the 

sensor signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for compensating for phase 
shift. Such an apparatus may be used for compensating for phase shift 
between an excitation signal and an output or return signal of a 
transducer, such as a linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT). In many applications, for instance in the aerospace field, a transducer is 
used at a location which is remote from processing electronics for the 
transducer output or return signal. Transducers such as LVDT's require 
an excitation signal, such as a sine wave, and return an output signal 
whose amplitude provides a measure of a physical property. For 
instance, in an aircraft, a LVDT may be connected via an aircraft wiring 
loom to a processing control circuit. The electronic processing circuit 
generates the excitation signal and receives the return signal, which is 
typically compared with the excitation signal in order to derive the 
measured quantity. However, because of the remote location of the 
transducer, there is a phase shift between the excitation and return 
signals in the processing circuit which requires compensation in order for 
the quantity to be correctly measured. In general, this phase shift, which 
results from the inductance of the wiring loom and from temperature 
effects, is not accurately predictable and cannot therefore be fully 
compensated for. According to the invention, there is provided an apparatus for 
compensating for phase shift, comprising an excitation generator for 
generating an excitation signal, characterised in that the excitation 
generator is arranged to generate the excitation signal having a first phase 
with respect to a reference phase, and characterised by a phase  
 
comparator for comparing a second phase of a return signal with the 
reference phase and a phase varying circuit for varying the first phase 
and/or the second phase so that the second phase is equal to a 
predetermined phase with respect to the reference phase. Preferably the predetermined phase is equal to zero. The comparing means may comprise a phase splitter for splitting the 
return signal into in-phase (real) and quadrature (imaginary) components 
with respect to the predetermined phase. The phase varying means may 
be arranged to vary the first phase and/or the second phase so that the 
amplitude of the quadrature component is equal to zero. The phase 
splitter may comprise means for multiplying the return signal by first and 
second sine waves of the same frequency and in quadrature, and the 
phase
