wherein A represents a group with a positive Hammett σ
p
 value, and L 
is a divalent linking group.

support and at least one silver halide emulsion layer on at least 

one side of said support coated from an emulsion containing silver 
iodohalide crystals prepared according to the method described 

hereinbefore. Moreover a method is described for the processing of 
said photographic material within a processing time of less than 50

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of silver 
halide emulsions, to X-ray silver halide photographic materials in 
which the said emulsions can be used and to the processing of said 
materials. As it becomes more and more important in medical X-ray diagnosis 
for the exposed and processed films to become available to the 
examiner as soon as possible, there is a stringent demand for films 
suitable for rapid processing applications, also with respect to 
concurrent electronic systems. This can be translated as a 
requirement for rapid developability or high intrinsic sensitivity 
of the silver halide crystals, and further for providing images with 
a good image quality, having a neutral image tone, i.e. without dye 
stain. Intrinsic sensitivity may be enhanced e.g. by enriching the 
iodide content of silver halide crystals to a certain extent. 
Moreover an enhanced amount of iodide will offer the possibility to 
get a better adsorption of certain spectral sensitizer. However dye 
stain may become more important and the development may be inhibited 
as the lower solubility may make the kinetics of development and 
fixation decrease. This occurs in particular in rapid processing 
conditions due to the very short development, fixing and rinsing 
times which do not allow the total destruction and/or rinsing out of 
those sensitizing or non-sensitizing dyes. The way in which iodide ions have been built into the crystal 
volume and more particularly in the vicinity of and/or at the 
crystal surface is very critical to get a suitable compromise 
between high sensitivity (as a result of intrinsic sensitivity of 
the silver halide crystal and improved adsorption of spectral 
sensitizer) and rapid processability. Already in the nucleation phase during silver halide 
precipitation a problem arises when iodide ions are present in the 
reaction vessel or into the halide solution feeding system. Due to 
its low solubility, silver iodide crystals are formed more quickly  
 
than silver halide crystals having other compositions. The 
efficiency with which the so-called "micromixing" proceeds in the 
reaction vessel with central stirring means during precipitation is 
insufficient. As a consequence it is nearly impossible to reach a 
homogenous halide distribution in the initially, quickly formed 
nuclei. As the said silver iodide crystals further take part in 
Ostwald ripening and recrystallisation processes during 
precipitation, it is impossible to determine exactly where and how 
much iodide ions are
