<ABSTRACT>
On a filter assembly machine (1), a succession of 
groups (13), each consisting of two cigarette portions, 

a double filter between the two cigarette portions, and 
a gummed strip (14) connected integral with, along a 

generating line of, and projecting forwards from the 
group (13), is fed by an input conveyor (3) to a loading 

station (5) where each group (13) is transferred into a 
respective seat (42, 43) on a rolling device (4) with 

multiple rolling channels (45); the groups (13) being 
unloaded off the rolling device (4) with a smaller pitch 

(P2) as compared with the input pitch (P1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing filter-tipped cigarettes. Filter-tipped cigarettes are normally produced 
from double cigarettes, each formed by rolling a gummed 
strip of paper material about a group consisting of two 
cigarette portions separated axially by a filter twice 
as long as that of a finished filter-tipped cigarette. The strips are normally rolled about said groups 
by means of a rolling device to which the groups are 
normally fed by an input roller with a number of 
peripheral seats. Each seat receives and retains by 
suction both a respective group, and a respective gummed 
strip with one end connected to the group, along a 
generating line of the group opposite the seat, and 
projecting rearwards from the group in relation to the 
rotation direction of the input roller. US Patent n. 4,848,371 relates to a so-called 
"multiple-channel" rolling method. Here and hereinafter, the term "multiple-channel 
rolling" is intended to mean a rolling method whereby  
 
each group is fed to a respective transfer conveyor by 
which it is fed along a respective rolling channel in 
turn traveling along a given path. More specifically, as described in US Patent 
n. 4,848,371, the input roller transfers the groups 
successively to a central rolling device or drum 
substantially tangent to the input roller at a loading 
station, and rotating, at a first given speed equal, at 
the loading station, to that of the input roller, about 
an axis parallel to the rotation axis of the input 
roller. The central drum comprises a ring of peripheral 
transfer rollers, each mounted on the drum so as to 
rotate, in relation to the drum, about a respective axis 
parallel to the rotation axis of the drum, and so as to 
define, with a peripheral portion of the drum, a 
respective rolling channel moving at said first speed 
along a circular path. Each transfer roller presents a 
respective peripheral seat which, by virtue of the 
central drum and the respective transfer roller rotating 
about their respective axes, travels through the loading 
station together with and at the same speed as a 
corresponding seat on the input roller, and is supplied 
by the input roller with a respective group and strip, 
which it feeds along said respective rolling channel. At 
the end of the rolling operation, said seat receives the 
newly formed double cigarette and, in the same way as 
for pickup but in reverse, transfers it to a seat on an 
output roller.

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing filter-tipped cigarettes, 
the method being characterized by the fact that it 

comprises, in combination, stages consisting in feeding, 
by means of an input conveyor (3), in a given direction 

and with a first given pitch (P1), a succession of 
groups (13), each comprising at least one cigarette 

portion, a filter, and a gummed strip (14) connected 
integral with and along a generating line of the group 

(13), and projecting forwards from the group (13) in 
said given direction; successively transferring said 

groups (13) into respective seats (42, 43) on a rolling 
device (4) of the type presenting multiple rolling 

channels (45), the rolling device (4) feeding said seats 
(42, 43) with a second given pitch (P3) along a path 

(S) tangent to the input conveyor (3) at a loading 
station (5) and to an output conveyor (9) at an 

unloading station (10); rolling said groups (13) into 
filter-tipped cigarettes (19) as they travel between 

said loading and unloading stations (5, 10); and 
transferring the filter-tipped cigarettes (19) to the 

output conveyor (9) by adjusting the pitch of the 
cigarettes (19) so that they are fed along the output 

conveyor (9) with a third pitch (P2) differing from 
the first pitch (P1). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the third pitch (P2) is smaller than  

 
the first. 
A method of producing filter-tipped cigarettes, 
the method comprising stages consisting in successively 

feeding respective transfer conveyors (40) with groups 
(13), each comprising two cigarette portions, a double 

filter between the two cigarette portions, and a gummed 
strip (14) connected integral with, along a generating 

line of, and projecting from, said group (13); winding 
each strip (14) about the respective group (13) by 

feeding the group (13) along a respective rolling 
channel (45) by means of the respective transfer 

conveyor (40) moving at a first speed (V3); and feeding 
each rolling channel (45) along a given path (S) and at 

a second speed (V2) to an unloading station (10); each 
transfer conveyor (40) presenting a seat (42, 43) for a 

respective said group (13); and each group (13) being 
transferred into the respective said seat (42, 43) off

(S) at a loading station (5); characterized by the fact 

that, on the input conveyor (3), each said gummed strip 
(14) is so positioned on the respective group (13) as to 

project frontwards from the group (13) in the traveling 

direction of the input conveyor (3); said second speed 
(V2) being a substantially constant speed, and said 

first speed (V3) being a variable speed.
