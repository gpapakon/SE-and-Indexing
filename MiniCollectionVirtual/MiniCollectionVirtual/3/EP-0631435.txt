<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to reservation-recording
of a video cassette recorder (referred
to hereinafter as VCR), and more particularly to an apparatus
and a method for performing the reservation-recording
of the VCR using a G code.Typically, a G code is shown in a broadcasting
program guide publication and used to reservation-record
a desired broadcasting program in a VCR. The
G code includes coded reservation-recording information
for the purpose of provision of a convenience in the
reservation-recording of the VCR.The G code was developed by the name of
GEMSTAR VCR PLUS by GEMSTAR Company in the
beginning step. The G code is comprised of a plurality
of figures, which contain reservation-recording information
regarding a single broadcasting program, such as
a guide channel number of a broadcasting station, a recording
time, a date, a recording length and etc..A length or the number of bits of the G code is
typically 4-8EA for the reservation-recording of the VCR
although it may be somewhat different every program.
The user can readily transfer reservation-recording information
of a desired broadcasting program to the VCR
by applying the corresponding G code to the VCR using
figure keys on a remote controller or a VCR panel. The
input of the reservation-recording information of the desired
broadcasting program to the VCR using the G
code can be performed by pushing about 4-8 of the figure
keys. Therefore, the reservation-recording information
of the desired broadcasting program can conveniently
be applied to the VCR.Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a block diagram
of a conventional apparatus for performing the reservation-recording
of the VCR using the G code. As
shown in this drawing, the conventional reservation-recording
apparatus comprises a key input signal receiver
1 for receiving the G code and guide channel mapping
signals which are applied by the user, a controller 2 for
controlling a VCR system, and a key input signal discriminator
3 for converting a key input signal or the G
code from the key input signal receiver 1 into reservation-recording
data under the control of the controller 2.
The reservation-recording data contains a guide channel
number, a recording start time, a recording length
and etc..A reservation-recording data storage unit 4 is
provided in the conventional reservation-recording apparatus
to store the reservation-recording data from the
key input signal discriminator 3 and output the stored
reservation-recording data under the control of the controller
