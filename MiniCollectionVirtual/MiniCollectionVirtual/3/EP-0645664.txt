<ABSTRACT>
A camera has a display (15) for displaying a subject with 
colors which are determined in accordance with a color 

correction coefficient. The coefficient is generated in 
accordance with photographic parameters, such as a shutter 

speed, an aperture, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assembly comprising a camera and
an improved monitor device for monitoring a subject to
be taken a picture.A subject to be taken a picture is looked through a
viewfinder of a camera, so that a required picture may be
taken on a photo film by adjusting a photographing condition.When a shutter, which is arranged behind a lens, is
opened in a predetermined time, light from the subject
image is formed on the film. The shutter speed and aperture
are adjusted based on the weather, types of the film and
sensitive paper and the like to take the picture well.According to a conventional camera, the image looked
through the viewfinder and the image taken on the
photo-sensitive paper can be different in color each other.
A color is defined by the brightness and chroma.Similar problems are encountered with cameras having
electronic displays such as those disclosed in JP 5107594
and WO 90/07727.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to
provide a camera having a monitor device for monitoring a
subject to be taken a picture with colors which are
identical to those of a printed image.According to the invention, there is provided a
photographic assembly as defined in claim 1. In the accompanying drawings:Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a camera
according to the invention.Figure 2 is a rear view of the camera shown in Fig. 1.Figure 3 is an expanded view showing a mode switch of
the camera shown in Fig. 1.Figure 4 is an expanded view showing a display window
of the camera shown in Fig.1.Figure 5 is a block diagram showing a circuit
structure of the camera shown in Fig. 1.Figure 6 is an explanatory diagram for a CCD used in
the camera shown in Fig. 1.Figure 7 is a table showing color correction
coefficients stored in a ROM of the camera shown in Fig. 1.A camera with a monitor device according to the
invention is now explained in conjunction with the appended
drawings.Figs. 1 and 2 shows the camera, which includes a power
switch 10, a display window 11 for displaying a variety of
information and warning, an adjust knob 12 for adjusting 
photographing parameters by turning itself, a mode switch 13 for
changing a mode to be adjusted, a rear cover 14, an LCD (Liquid
Crystal Display) 15 mounted on the rear cover 14, a lens 18 to
which light is supplied from a subject, and a shutter release 19
used for driving a shutter.Fig. 3 shows the mode switch 13, which is provided
with mode input channels for aperture 33, shutter speed 34, film
ISO 35 and type of sensitive paper 36. When mode

<CLAIMS>
A photographic assembly comprising a camera and a monitor device for monitoring a subject to be photographed with said camera, the monitor device
comprising


display means (15) for displaying an image of the
subject with colours determined in accordance with

the photographic conditions set in the camera, characterised in that the monitor device further comprises
means (32) for storing colour correction coefficients
corresponding to a combination of predetermined

photographic parameters including aperture, shutter speed,
sensitivity of film and type of photosensitive paper, and
means (31) for retrieving the colour correction
coefficient corresponding to a combination of photographic

parameters set in the camera and for transmitting the
colour correction coefficient to said display means,

whereby the colours of the image displayed by said display means are determined in accordance with said colour correction coefficient.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the means (32) for
storing colour correction coefficients is a ROM that stores

colour correction coefficients (Rn, Gn, Bn) depending on
the combination of predetermined parameters, and the display means

(15) for displaying an image of the object includes:

an image signal generator (40) for generating picture
element signals (R, G, B) from the light received from the

subject, and
an image processor (25) for processing the picture
element signals (R, G, B) according to the colour

correction coefficients (Rn, Gn, Bn) to provide corrected
picture element signals.
