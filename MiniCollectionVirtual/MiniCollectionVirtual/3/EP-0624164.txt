<ABSTRACT>
We have discovered synthetic peptides with only 8 to 15 amino acid residues in chain with the molecular weight between 900 and 1600 Daltons, that have biological activity of the natural body protecting compound BPC, but with increased selectivity. Our new peptides are more economically produced and are less subject to the effects of side reaction because they contain less amino acid residues than BPC.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of peptides having a high
biological activity of the same type as known for
natural compound BPC, but with shorter amino acid
chains, in the preparation of medicaments for treating various diseases.A biologically active protein with organo-protective
activity which was isolated from human
or animal body and named BPC (Body protecting
Compound) was disclosed in EP 0 432 400 and also
published: P. Sikiri√ß et al., Exp.Clin.
Gastroenterol.,1 15-26, 1991. This protein has a
high molecular weight of about 40 000 + 5000
Daltons, with only partial determined structure.
This compound has a very broad spectrum of biological
activities like: ulcer protective,
hepatoprotective, anti viral, anti edematous,
general anti inflammation activity, anti malignant
activity and others. It should be used in the
therapy of cited diseases, further in the therapy
of diseases and disorders of nerve system,
disorders of dopaminergic ethiology, surgery,
stomatology, in the curing of infertility and in
veterinary medicine. But this broad spectrum of
activity can be probably a consequence of 
undetermined structure or even of insufficient
purity or homogeneity of isolated compound BPC.EP-A-572 688 discloses N-terminal peptides of BPC and particular
therapeutic uses of these peptides. This document has not been published
prior to the priority date of the present invention and is
therefore only relevant for the question of novelty. The present
invention, is based on and uses a class of synthetic
peptides which exhibit surprisingly high biological
activity, especially in the sence of body
protection. In any case these synthetical compounds
with well defined structure have a great advantage
in comparison to the only partially defined high
molecular protein BPC, which is obtainable only by a
difficult procedure from dubious natural source.More particularly, this invention is based on and uses a
class of biologically highly active peptides,
consisting of 8 to 15 amino acid residues, which
are represented by the following basic structural
formula using the three letter amino acid code and
the numbers below each amino acid residue refer to
the position of the residue in the peptide chain:

wherein one or more amino acid residues are
substituted. The substiuents Xaa, Yaa and Zaa which
may be employed are shown in the following table I.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of biologically highly active
peptides consisting of 8 to

15 amino acid residues and being represented by the
general formula:



in which:

Xaa signifies a neutral aliphatic amino acid
residue like:

Ala, bAla, Leu, Ile, Gly, Val, Nle, Nva
Yaa signifies a basic amino acid residue like:

Lys, Arg, Orn, His
Zaa signifies an acidic amino acid residue like:

Glu, Asp, Aad or Apm;

wherein at least one of residues Xaa or Zaa can be
omitted, and/or any one of peptides with Seq.Id.No: 1 to 11 for

the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition 
for treating

disturbances and
lesions of liver kidney and pancreas, atrophy of testis

and sperms mobility, fertility disturbances,
commercial breeding improvement, rickettsias

illnesses, thyreoparathyreoidoctomy, diabetes
mellitus, disturbances of adrenal gland,

disturbances of hematopoetic system, disturbances
of coagulation, disturbances of bleeding, post-castration/menopausal

disturbances, ischemic and
toxic lesions, psychiatric disturbances,

hypertension, disturbances of body temperature,
pain or tumor.

means of an amide linkage between the first and last amino acid residue.
