The present invention relates to disposable absorbent articles
or undergarments. The disposable articles are essentially
designed as conventional disposable diapers however they are

end of the article. The disposable article is applied to a
wearer by slipping the endless waistband onto the hips such
that the absorbent part of the article is in front or behind
the wearer and can be pulled between the legs to the opposing
side and be attached to the endless waistband.Undergarments and disposable diapers are well established
products. The prior art on belts or bands in connection with
disposable diapers is also very crowded. For example US 849725
and US 3890973 disclose absorbent garments having two belts
which in use form an endless circular belt together with the
front and back longitudinal end of the absorbent product. In 
its flat, stretched out shape this product has one part of an
elastic belt laterally extending from each side of the garment.US 1,580,464 disclose a bifurcated garment adapted to encircle the hips and upper leg portions of
the body. The patent teaches the preamble of claim 1 of the present
invention. US 3618608 and 4128326 as well as FR 2586558 disclose diapers
having a belt adjacent or near one of the waist margins. The
belt laterally extends to either side of the diaper and is
attached to the opposite waist margin. US 4158906 discloses a
diaper such which fastens opposing sides of the diaper. The
length of the diaper sinch is adjustable and is independent
from the rest of the diaper. US 4315508 discloses garments
having two elastic pieces for form a removable elastic belt.
One piece on each side connects the front and the rear waist
margins of the garment. FR 2612770 discloses disposable pants
having integral straps which encircle the waist of the wearer
and are secured by fasteners.EP-A-409307 or PCT 9007160 both disclose attachable elastic
waist belts and EP-A-352208 and DE-A-3238450 disclose
disposable diapers having a detachable elastic waist belt
which allows them to be used like pull-up pants or regular
undergarments. US 4205679 also discloses disposable
undergarments which can be slipped on like regular underpants
having an elastic waist band. A leak proof underpants carrying
a disposable catamenial is known from US 4690681 which allows
the wearer to put the catamenial on in the same fashion as a
regular underpants. A similar construction used as a child's
training pants is known from US 4646362 also having an
