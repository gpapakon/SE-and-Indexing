<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical form for rectal administration 
consisting of a sheath (1) of gelatine containing: 


(a) one or more capsules (3) made of a mixture of 
gelatine and glycerine, for example in a quantity by 

weight of approximately 70% of gelatine and 30% of 
glycerine, 
(b) one or more supports, such as tablets (2), 
containing the active agent, the supports being non-liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new pharmaceutical form for
the rectal administration of pharmacologically active
compounds.The rectal administration of pharmacologically active
molecules is widely used. This form of administration has
the advantage over oral administration that it is
unaffected by the ingestion of foods, nausea or low
intestinal absorption.On the other hand, this form of administration can be
used in patients who are incapable of salivating, who are
unconscious or who have to go without food before an
operation.Published European Patent Application EP-A-0 147 479
describes a water and drug delivery system for suppository
use. The subject-matter of the application relates to
pharmaceutical forms for the rectal administration of
active ingredients comprising an aqueous core in a waxy
housing, surrounded by a matrix, which comprises a drug,
located in the matrix itself, water soluble or dispersible
excipients, such as polyethylene glycol, gelatin, starch,
lactose or cellulosic derivatives, osmotic-active agents,
absorption promoter and a coating, which coating is a semi-permeable
film, selected from cellulose acetate, polyvinyl
acetate and ethylene vinyl acetate. The matrix, in which
the active agent is located, gives the drug delivery system
shape, rigidity and preserves the integrity of the device
prior to use.Nevertheless, since the rectum is made up of zones
differing in their characteristics, the effects of
treatment by rectal administration vary according to the
pharmaceutical forms used and their anatomical positioning. Thus, the positioning of a pharmaceutical form in the
lower part of the rectum enables the active principle which
it contains to pass directly into the general circulation.
Forms positioned in the upper or middle part of the rectum
enable the active principles which they contain to pass
into the portal system. In that case, the active principle
is in danger of undergoing metabolic degradation in the
liver.Forms which provide for specific administration in the
lower part of the rectum have already been described in the
prior art literature. They have outer surfaces comprising
bioadhesive substances which facilitate their retention by
the layer of mucus covering that part, this retention
preventing the pharmaceutical form from moving towards the
upper parts of the rectum.Suppositories containing fats are unsuitable for this
application because they cannot be retained in the lower
part of the rectum on account of their composition.
Suppositories made of hydrogels, such as

<CLAIMS>
A pharmaceutical form for the rectal administration
of at least one pharmacologically active compound

assimilable in the lower part of the rectum, with at
least one pharmacologically compound and water-soluble

and/or dispersible excipients in the interior of a
coating, characterized in that the said pharmaceutical

form consists of a sheath of which the outer wall
comprises a material with bioadhesive properties, the

interior of the sheath contains side by side available
the combination of:


(a) at least one capsule containing at least one
hygroscopic substance and
(b) an effective quantity of the said compound in a
non-liquid form.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the ratio by weight of the quantities of

hygroscopic substances contained in the sheath and the
capsules to the quantities of non-hygroscopic substances

is at least 1.5 and preferably at least 2.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the quantity of hygroscopic substances

is at least 400 mg and preferably 600 mg per
dosage unit.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the active compound is

present in a support, advantageously a delayed-release
support, such as tablets, microgranules, either free or

accommodated in a sheath, gels and the like.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the active compound is in the

form of matrix compounds in which the active agent is
trapped in a polymer network from it escapes slowly.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the bioadhesive material is

gelatine. 
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the capsule is made of

gelatine, glycerine and advantageously a mixture of
gelatine and glycerine.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 7, characterized in that it consists of a sheath (1)

of gelatine containing:

(a) one or more capsules (3) made of a mixture of
gelatine and glycerine, for example in a quantity by

weight of approximately 70% of gelatine and 30% of
glycerine,
(b) one or more supports, such as tablets (2),
containing the active agent, the supports being non-liquid.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the supports are sandwiched

between two capsules.
A pharmaceutical form as claimed in any of claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the supports are accommodated

in the sheath either between or adjacent the capsules.
