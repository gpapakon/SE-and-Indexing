<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a lightweight structural panel which is profile-reinforced in two axes, in particular for constructing lightweight, wide-span sheet-like load-bearing structures, having the following features: the static height of the panel is made out of at least one layer (lag) of a thin material, in particular sheet metal, of which the starting plane, for reinforcement in at least two axes while avoiding straight bending lines (knl), merges into regular beads which follow on continuously from one another, the beads being pushed one into the other and/or being displaced and/or rotated with respect to one another. The beads have height lines (hli) and/or height surfaces (hfl) and reinforcing side surfaces (fla). The height lines run in the flange planes, for reinforcing the same, in particular over the full length of the panel. Either each individual layer no longer has any straight bending axis as a result of the arrangement of the beads, or layers with bending lines running between the beads are reinforced by combining a plurality of layers, the beads of the two layers being fixed in a frictionally locking manner along the bending lines of the respectively other layer.
