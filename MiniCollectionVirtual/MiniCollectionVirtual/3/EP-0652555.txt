<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an optical recording medium 
comprising a transparent substrate; a recording layer on 

the transparent substrate;a metal reflective layer; and 
one or more protective layers. These layers are 

laminated successively on the transparent substrate. The 
outermost protective layer is formed of an ultraviolet 

curable resin containing an organic filler and/or an 
inorganic filler having water absorbency and/or oil 

absorbency. The protective layer has a printable surface 
permitting writing characters with writing instruments or 

ink jet printers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medium, in
particular to an optical recording medium, on which data
can be written with, for example, writing implements, an
ink-jet printer, or a sublimation printer.Sophisticated information society in recent years
has caused strong demands toward recording media capable
of high storage density, as an alternative to magnetic
recording media. As such recording media, compact discs
(CDs) and laser discs (LDs) are well known and are widely
used. The CDs and LDs are optical read-only media
produced by a pressing process. In this process, a plain
glass disc known as a glass master is formed into a
stamper. The stamper is equivalent to a photographic
negative in the sense that it is a reverse to the final
compact disc. This stamper is used to make a pressing on
a transparent polymer, and the stamped surface is then
plated with a reflective film or the like. A plastic
coating is finally applied over the film to form an end
product. This process permits cost-saving, mass
production of media having the same information but is 
not suitable for a case where a small number of media is
to be produced because the stamper is expensive. With
this respect, methods to produce in a small scale and
user-recordable optical recording medium have been
developed.Optical recording medium can generally be classified
into two groups: recordable media and erasable media.
The former permits recording and reproduction of data
while the latter permits erasure of recorded data. Of
these, a recordable compact disc with a single substrate
is called CD-R. The CD-R is compatible with common read-only
CDs and has thus been used widely. The CD-R may be
written upon by a user who bought an "empty" disc.
Accordingly, it is necessary to provide an indicator for
the recorded data so that the user can see what
information is stored in the disc.Users are familiar with a felt-tip with oil based
ink to indicate the contents of the disc as a title.
Hand-written titles are, however, not preferable for
applications where the CD-Rs with data recorded therein
are sold to end users. On the other hand, the CD-R may
be labeled like a floppy disk with paper or plastic film
on which well-designed characters and pictures are
printed. However, a large donut-shaped label is required
when the entire surface of the disc is to be labeled. It 
is difficult to position the label positively on the disc
for labeling. In addition, the label may be stripped off
and be caught by components in a disc player. With this
respect other
