<ABSTRACT>
A multi-ply web forming apparatus is disclosed for forming a top ply on a base ply. The former includes a looped lower forming wire (16) for receiving the base ply thereon and a top looped forming wire (18) cooperating with and disposed above the lower wire for defining therebetween a generally horizontally disposed forming section (20) having a first (22) and a second end (24). A turning bar (26) defines a curved surface (28) for guiding the lower wire. A secondary headbox (30) ejects stock towards and onto the base ply. A curved dewatering shoe (34) is disposed beneath the lower wire (16) such that a portion of water from the top ply is ejected through the top wire (18). A vacuum slot (38) collects a portion of water upwardly away from the top wire. An inverted vacuum box (40) is disposed downstream relative to the vacuum slot (38) and a plurality of dewatering blades (44-56) disposed between a curved face (42) of the vacuum box and the top wire (18) guide the top wire therepast. A plurality of dewatering foils (58-61) are disposed on the opposite side of the wire relative to the blades such that the consistency of the stock forming the top ply is increased during passage thereof through the forming section while maintaining the consistency of the top ply uniform in a "Z" direction so that crushing of the resultant web is inhibited.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-ply web forming apparatus. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to a multi-ply web forming 
apparatus for forming a top ply on a base ply. Bel BondTM top wire formers permit upward removal of water from 
stock so that the resultant web has more uniform surface characteristics 
thereon. More specifically, when stock is ejected from a headbox onto a 
fourdrinier wire, water is drained downwardly, leaving a fibrous web on the 
upper surface of the wire. Thereafter, the fibrous web is transferred to a 
press section for removing more water from the formed web. The aforementioned downward drainage of water causes uneven 
surface characteristics on the resultant web. The Bel BondTM unit is a top 
wire unit which includes a looped top wire which cooperates with the lower 
fourdrinier wire to define therebetween a forming section.  
 Water is removed upwardly from the stock during 
passage thereof through the forming section such that more 
even surface characteristics are imparted to the resultant 
formed web. However, in the formation of a multi-ply web, a 
base ply is initially formed on the lower fourdrinier wire, 
and a secondary headbox is disposed immediately upstream 
relative to a top wire Bel BondTM apparatus. Another arrangement of this type is disclosed in 
EP-A-0 397 430 which describes a multi-ply web forming 
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. More specifically, EP-A-0 397 430 discloses a 
multi-ply web forming apparatus for forming a top ply on a 
base ply which includes a secondary headbox depositing 
stock on a base ply for generating the top ply, and a 
generally horizontally disposed twin wire forming zone 
comprising an inverted vacuum box with a plurality of 
dewatering blades disposed above the top wire and 
dewatering foils disposed on the opposite side of the wires 
relative to the dewatering blades. In EP-A-0 397 430, the dewatering foils are placed 
in correspondence with the blades.  
 Although the aforementioned arrangement has proved successful in 
the formation of a multi-ply web, there exists a tendency for the top ply to 
crush during subsequent pressing thereof. More particularly, when the stock is ejected from the secondary 
headbox, there exists a tendency for a fibrous mat to form on the underside 
of the top wire, such fibrous mat tends to trap lower consistency stock 
therebelow so that in the subsequent pressing operation, crushing of the 
web occurs. The present invention seeks to overcome the
