<ABSTRACT>
A collection vehicle has a pair of hoists (20, 21) mounted on a 
common carrier (12). The carrier is hinged to a body (10) of the vehicle for 

swinging relative thereto about an upright axis. When the carrier is swung away 
from the body, electrical and hydraulic components at a front face of the carrier 

are readily accessible.

<DESCRIPTION>
From one aspect, the present invention relates to a collection vehicle 
comprising a body defining a chamber for receiving material to be collected and 
a hoist for raising from the ground a bin containing material to be collected and 
for tipping the bin to discharge said material into the body. There are well known collection vehicles in which the body defines, in 
addition to the chamber, a hopper for receiving material discharged from a bin, 
the hopper being at a rear of the vehicle and the chamber being forwards from 
the hopper. In such vehicles, the hoist or a pair of hoists is mounted at the rear 
of the vehicle on the outside of the hopper. Typically, the or each hoist includes 
a plurality of hydraulic rams or other forms of hydraulic motor, valves for 
controlling operation of the hydraulic motors and signalling devices responsive to 
movement of components of the hoist to predetermined positions to provide 
signals for controlling operation of the valves. The signalling devices and other 
elements of control means of the hoist easily become contaminated by foreign 
matter. US-A-4479751 discloses a collection vehicle according to the preamble 
to Claim 1 which is the same as the collection vehicles discussed herebefore 
except that the specification does not specifically disclose a hopper. The aim of the present invention is to provide a collection vehicle 
according to the preamble to Claim 1 in which the above mentioned problem of 
contamination by foreign matter is overcome or is reduced. According to a first aspect of the invention, a collection vehicle 
according to the preamble of Claim 1 is characterised in that the body defines a 
hopper into which material to be collected can be tipped, 
the carrier is pivotable relative to the body about a 
pivot axis which is generally upright when the vehicle stands on level ground, and 
releasable retaining means is provided for retaining the carrier in a working  
 
position on the body and in that the hoist is mounted on the carrier for movement 
therewith relative to the body from the working position to a servicing position. In a vehicle embodying the first aspect of the invention, the 
accessibility of at least some components of or associated with the hoist is better 
when the carrier is in the servicing position than when the carrier is in the 
working position. In the working position, components may be shielded and 
relatively inaccessible. The arrangement in the working position can be such as 
to protect the components to a useful

<CLAIMS>
A collection vehicle comprising a body (10) defining a chamber (2) for 
receiving material to be collected and a hoist (20,21) for raising from the ground 

a bin containing material to be collected and for tipping the bin to discharge said 
material into the body, a carrier (12) for the hoist (20,21), the hoist including a 

bin carrier (22), and a hydraulic motor for raising the bin carrier (22) relative to 
the carrier (12), characterised in that the body (10) defines a hopper (11) into 

which material to be collected can be tipped, the carrier is connected to the body 
by a connecting member (18), and the carrier 12 is pivotable relative to the 

connecting member (18) and hence relative to the body (10) about a pivot axis 
which is generally upright when the vehicle stands on level ground, and releasable 

retaining means (19
a
) is provided for retaining the carrier (12) in a working 
position and in that the hoist (20,21) is mounted on the carrier (12) for pivotal 

movement therewith from the working position to a servicing position. 
A vehicle according to Claim 1 wherein the pivot axis (17) is adjacent 
to one lateral boundary of the carrier (12) and the retaining means (19
a
) is 
adjacent to an opposite lateral boundary of the carrier, when the carrier is in the 

working position. 
A vehicle according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the pivot axis (17) 
is defined by respective hinge elements (13,14;15
a
;16
a
) on the carrier (12) and on 
the connecting body (18) and wherein the carrier (12) is movable both about the 

pivot axis (17) and along the pivot axis (17) to separate hinge elements (13,14) 
of the carrier (12) from hinge elements (15,16) of the connecting member (18). 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the  
 

hoist includes a mechanical link (22
a
) at the rear of the carrier, and at least one 
component of a control circuit is at the front of the carrier, when the carrier is 

in the working position. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
carrier (12) is generally of plate-like form. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
hydraulic motor of the hoist (20,21) comprises a rotary actuator mounted on the 

carrier at the rear of the carrier. 
A method of substituting a first hoist for a second hoist in a collection 
vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims 3 to 6 wherein the carrier 

of the second hoist is swung about an axis relative to a body of the vehicle from 
a working position to an extended position, the carrier of the second hoist is 

moved along the axis relative to the body to disengage the carrier from the body 
and is then moved away from the body, the carrier of the first hoist is moved 

along the axis into an engaged relation with the body and the carrier of the first 
hoist is then swung about the axis into the working position.
