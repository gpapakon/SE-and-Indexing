<ABSTRACT>
A hinge cup (4) having a housing (9, 10) which can be inserted into a bore (16) in a furniture part (13) and having dowel-like, clamping jaws (21) which can be inserted into the bore (16), can be spread out and can be pressed onto the wall of the bore via spreading parts (2) configured as tie rods. Via an eccentric lever (1'), the spreading parts (2) can move in the insertion direction of the hinge cup (4), perpendicularly to the assembly plane thereof. The clamping jaws (21) are cylinder portions consisting of a viscoelastic material. The metallic spreading parts (2), which are located between the hinge cup and the clamping jaws, exhibit hooks (3) at their free ends. Provided opposite the hooks (3) are press-on cams (6) which are supported on the housing wall (10) of the hinge cup (4).

<CLAIMS>
Hinge pot having a housing (9,10) which can be inserted in 
a bore (16) in a furniture part (13) and having dowel-type 

expandable clamping jaws (21) which can be inserted in the bore 
(16) and which can be pressed against the bore wall by way of 

expanding parts constructed as tie rods, the expanding parts (2) 
being movable by way of an eccentric lever (11) in the direction 

of insertion of the hinge pot (4) perpendicular to the plane of 
mounting thereof, and expansion of the clamping jaws (21) which 

serve as anchoring parts taking place when the expanding parts 
(2) are moved in the direction from the insertion end of the 

hinge pot (4) towards the mounting face thereof, characterized 
in that the anchoring parts are formed from cylinder segment-shaped 

clamping jaws (21) of visco-elastic material, for example 
plastics or rubber, arranged on the casing of the hinge pot (4), 

and in that the expanding parts (2) are arranged between the 
casing of the hinge pot (4) and the clamping jaws (21). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
expanding parts (2) have at their free end a curved expanding 

body (27) with an approximately triangular cross-section. 
Hinge pot according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
metal expanding parts (2), which are located between the casing 

of the hinge pot and the clamping jaws (21), have hooks (3) at 
their free ends and opposite the hooks (3) a contact pressure cam 

(6) which is supported against the housing wall of the hinge pot 
(4). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
contact pressure cam (6) is of mandrel-type construction, having 

a concave upper delimitation surface (7) which is matched to the 
transition curve (8) of the housing wall from the side wall (10) 

to the base (9).  
 
Hinge pot according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
hooks (3) project laterally beyond the clamping jaws (21). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 3, characterized in that two 
respective eccentric levers (1') are connected to one bracket 

(1). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
bracket (1), which is mounted on the housing of the hinge pot 

(4), in the clamped position covers a flange (23) of the hinge 
pot (4), the expanding parts (2) projecting through openings in 

the flange (23). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
expanding parts (2) are L-shaped with the hooks (3) and the 

clamping jaws (21) on the one hand bear against the flange (23) 
of the hinge pot (4) and on the other hand bear against the hook 

(3) of the expanding parts (2). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
centring pegs (17) are arranged on the underside of the flange 

(23). 
Hinge pot according to one of Claims 3 to 9, characterized 
in that the hooks (3) are segment-shaped in plan view. 
Hinge pot according to Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
there are constructed on the clamping jaws (21) lateral 

projections (14) between which the expanding parts (2) are 
guided. 
Hinge pot according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that the hooks (3) have on the inside a notch (24) into which 

a lug (25) constructed on the clamping jaws (21) projects. 
Hinge pot according to Claim 11, characterized in that the 
projections (14) have grooves (15) in which marginal webs (17)  

 
of the expanding parts (2) are guided. 
Hinge pot according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
bracket (1) is constructed as a handle for withdrawing the hinge 

pot (4). 
Hinge pot according to Claim 6 or 14, characterized in that 
the bracket (1) is mounted at least approximately on a diameter 

line of the hinge pot (4).
