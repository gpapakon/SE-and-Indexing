<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a platform lift with a platform (2) mounted on at least one upright (3) so that it can be displaced vertically. The upright is made up of elements (3a) fitted one on top of the other. The platform is connected to the upright by a driven slide (2c). In order to increase the range of applications of the platform lift, the lift is fitted with more uprights (3) than slides (2c) and the slides and/or uprights have a coupling device (7) designed to enable the platform (2) to be selectively connected to different uprights (3).

<CLAIMS>
A platform lift (1) comprising a platform (2) 
drivable up and down at least one supporting mast (3) 

and connected by a drivable slide (2c) to the or each 
mast (3), which is made up of components (3a) which can 

be placed on one another, characterised in that more 
masts (3) than slides (2c) are provided and the slides 

(2c) and/or masts (3) have a coupling device (7) for 
optionally connecting the platform (2) to different 

masts (3). 
A platform lift according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the masts (3) are mounted on a 

base component (3b) constituting a receiving member in 
the form of a coupling device (7) for an 

interchangeable component (9) which is adapted to the 
parts (4a, 5a) for guiding and driving the slide on the 

mast components (3a, c) and is adjacent the lowest (3c) 
of the mast components (3a) secured to the base 

component (3b). 
A platform lift according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that one open longitudinal side (10) 

of the interchangeable component (9) can be mounted on 
an upright part (8) forming the receiving member on the 

base component (3b) and can be suspended from the 
lowest mast component (3c). 
A platform lift according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the interchangeable component (9) 

is insertable into holders in the base component (3b),  
 

the slide-guiding and driving parts being aligned with 
the lowest mast component (3c). 
A platform lift according to any of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that the platform (2) has an 

undercarriage for moving from mast (3) to mast (3), the 
platform (2) being mounted on the undercarriage via a 

lifting device.
