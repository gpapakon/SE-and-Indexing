<ABSTRACT>
The refrigeration unit is composed of a cooling compartment (5) and a circulation compartment (4) which are separated by a wall defining, at the end, an inlet passage (6) and an outlet passage (7) between the compartments. The circulation compartment (4) is equipped with a vertical succession of conveyor belts (12, 13) defining a staged conveying path, and the cooling compartment (5) contains a main circulation fan (16), a series of cooling batteries (17, 18) through which an air flow passes, this air flow being forced between the two compartments (4, 5) in an air circulation loop. The application of the invention relates to the food industries.

Cooling unit for extruded doughy products,
comprising, in a body (2), a circulation-cooling

compartment (4) provided with a vertical
succession of longitudinal horizontal circulating

conveyor belts (12,13) arranged in stages defining
an elongate path of travel and, adjoining the

circulation-cooling compartment, a refrigeration
compartment (5) for producing a cooling and drying

ventilation flow, characterised in that said
compartments (4,5) are in communication, 
via
 their
ends, on one side of the circulation-cooling

compartment 
via
 an input passage (6) for the
ventilation flow, and on the other side 
via
 an
output passage (7) for said flow, thus defining an

air circulation circuit, from one compartment into
the other along the stages of the path of the

product, in a direction which is opposite to the
general direction of the progression of the

product to be cooled.
Cooling unit according to the preceding
Claim, characterised in that the refrigeration

compartment (5) contains a series of batteries
(17,18) of evaporators for producing the cold air,

having an integrated fan (19,20), and a principal 
circulation fan (16) arranged at the input of the

refrigeration compartment (5) behind said
evaporators (17,18) in the vicinity of the output

passage (7).
Cooling unit according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the

refrigeration compartment (5) comprises, at the
output, a heating element (25) and a temperature

sensor (26), with a view to the regulation of
temperature of the air flow, the heating element

(25) and the sensor (26) being placed in the
proximity of one another.
Cooling unit according to the preceding
Claim, characterised in that the heating element

(25) occupies the section of the input passage (6)
from the refrigeration compartment (5) to the

circulation compartment (4).
Cooling unit according to Claim 4,
characterised in that the heating element (25) is

a body through which rectilinear heating resistors
pass.
Cooling unit according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the

assembly of circulating conveyor belts (12,13) is 
driven by a single motor (22) by means of

spindles.
Cooling unit according to Claim 2,
characterised in that a compressor (21) for the

refrigeration assembly producing the flow of
cooling air by means of the batteries (17,18) of

the evaporators present in the refrigeration
compartment (5) is placed in the interior of the

body (2) for the assembly to form a transportable
container.
Cooling unit according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the

circulating conveyor belts (12,13) are arranged in
such a manner that the upstream end thereof

overhangs in the direction of travel in relation
to the upper belt, the first and last belts

(14,15) being driven in the direction of the front
side of the unit towards the downstream side, and

each intermediate belt (12,13) being driven in the
opposite direction to the upper belt.
Cooling unit according to any one of the
preceding Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the

temperature sensor (26) is influenced,
artificially, by heating the ventilation flow at

the output of the refrigeration compartment by 
means of the heating element (25).
