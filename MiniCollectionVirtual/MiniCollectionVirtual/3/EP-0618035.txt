<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a heating nozzle as an integral part of a solder/desolder device, in particular for integrated circuits, the heating nozzle has in the area of the nozzle discharge opening a component which is acted upon by the hot-gas flow of the heating nozzle and heats the soldering point by contact heat in addition to the hot gas of the heating nozzle.

<CLAIMS>
Heating nozzle as part of a soldering/unsoldering
apparatus, in particular for integrated circuits, with a

plate-like nozzle bottom (5) which is arranged in the
region of the nozzle outlet opening and on which impinges

a hot gas stream (6) and which is arranged in such a way
that between nozzle wall and nozzle bottom (5) is formed at

least one slot-like opening (4A) for passage of hot gas,
the nozzle bottom (5) being formed from a material which is

a good conductor of heat for heating a component (15) by
heat radiation or contact heating.
Heating nozzle according to claim 1, characterised in
that the nozzle housing (2) has an essentially rectangular,

preferably square outlet cross-section (4), the cross-sectional
area of the inlet opening (3) being smaller than

the cross-sectional area of the outlet opening (4).
Heating nozzle according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the heating nozzle (1) is of

exchangeable construction and in the region of the inlet

opening (3) encompasses a tube-like connection piece (11)
with a slot-like centring guide (12) extending from the

upper edge of the connection piece (11), and a preferably
concentrically arranged connection piece (10) of a suction

device (7).
Heating nozzle according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that recesses (13) for hot gas exit are

provided preferably in the corner region of the housing in
the vicinity of the nozzle bottom (5).
Heating nozzle according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the material of the nozzle bottom (5)

which is a good conductor of heat is a metallic material.
Heating nozzle according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that on the nozzle bottom (5) is provided

a suction device (7) with at least one suction opening (8)
extending through the nozzle bottom.
Heating nozzle according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the suction device (7) is centrally

connected to the nozzle bottom (5), the cross-section of
the suction opening tapering in the direction of the

connection piece (10).
Heating nozzle according to claim 6, characterised in
that the suction opening (8) encompasses an exchangeable,

preferably sleeve-like suction insert (9) whose upper edge
preferably projects just above the surface of the nozzle

bottom (5).
Heating nozzle according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the suction device (7) extends

centrally within the nozzle and is preferably releasably
connected to the nozzle bottom (5).
Soldering/unsoldering apparatus with a heating nozzle
according to any of the preceding claims.
