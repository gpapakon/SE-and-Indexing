<ABSTRACT>
Seismic airgun arrangement for attenuating unwanted oscillations in the emitted signal, whereby the airgun has one or more outlet ports (9) for exhausting air in a generally radial direction from a central axis of the airgun (10), and whereby a perforated screen (20) of plate material is provided around the airgun for the attenuation mentioned. The volume which is generally delimited within the screen (20) is significantly smaller than the maximum bubble size which is normally generated by the airgun (10). The screen (20) has an open side or end (20A) at a part of the screen being adapted to face at least partially downwards in the normal operative position of the airgun (10). At least edge portions of the screen along the open side or end (20A) are located substantially directly opposite the outlet port or ports (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a seismic airgun arrangement 
for attenuating unwanted oscillations in the emitted signal, 
whereby the airgun has one or more outlet ports for 
exhausting air in a generally radial direction from a central 
axis of the airgun, and whereby a perforated screen of plate 
material is provided around the airgun for the attenuation 
mentioned. Thus, the invention comprises a hydrodynamic screen 
being mounted externally of a seismic airgun. The purpose of 
the screen is in part to destroy and baffle the air bubble 
formed when a seismic airgun is fired. In marine seismic data acquisition an airgun is the 
mostly employed acoustic source. In such airguns the sound 
is generated by letting high pressure air (100-200 atmospheres) 
escape through port openings in the airgun. One of 
the drawbacks of the airgun as a seismic source is the fact 
that the signal generated has an oscillating nature, i.e. the 
signal is not a pure transient pressure pulse. Because of 
the oscillating air bubble which is formed in the water, 
there will be emitted several subsequent pressure pulses in 
addition to the primary pulse or amplitude. As a consequence 
of this the sound signal being emitted down into the water 
and the subsurface formation will be long (in terms of time), 
and this makes it difficult to interpret the seismic data 
being collected. In order to avoid bubble oscillations as mentioned above 
four usual methods are in use today: 
1. Employing many airguns of different volumes:  2. Arrangement of airguns in clusters; i.e. arranging the 
airguns quite close to each other. 3. Using a GI airgun, which is an assembly of two airguns. 4. Employing a "Waveshapekit" as will be explained below. The two first methods above involve the employment of 
interaction effects and the fact that different airgun 
volumes give different signals so as to compose a resulting 
signal being more optimal, i.e. wherein the bubble pulses 
will partially cancel each other. The GI airgun actually 
consists of two airguns in one and the same unit, where one  
 
airgun is used for generating the signal, whereas the other 
airgun is used for attenuating the bubble. The drawback of 
this airgun (which is the airgun emitting the most optimal 
signal) is that it is more expensive than conventional airguns, 
as well as it requires twice or thrice as much high 
pressure air as conventional airguns. The "Waveshapekit" 
mentioned above consists of a plate with holes provided 
inside the actual pressure chamber in the airgun.
