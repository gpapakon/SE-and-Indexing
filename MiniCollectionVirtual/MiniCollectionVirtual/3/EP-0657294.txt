<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for automatically
adjusting a gap between a platen and a recording head in
accordance with the thickness of a recording sheet.Prior art document EP-A-0393759 discloses an automatic
platen gap adjusting device for a printer, comprising carriage
driving means for driving a carriage in parallel with a platen
shaft, the carriage carrying a recording head means for
detecting a load of the carriage driving means when the
carriage is moved in parallel with the platen shaft at a
predetermined speed, and contact judgement means for judging
whether or not the recording head is in contact with the
recording sheet based on a comparison between a load at the
time the recording sheet is inserted in the printer and another
value. Further, moving means are provided for moving the
carriage in a direction orthogonal to the platen shaft based on
the judgement of the contact judgement means.In a recording head, and particularly a wire dot type
recording head that prints data by impinging wires onto a
recording sheet through an ink ribbon, a wire impinging speed
must be minimized in order to achieve high speed printing.Since the wire dot type recording head is mechanically
rigid and capable of copying data through a copying material,
the recording head can be used with a wide variety of different
types of sheets. This feature is problematic, however, because
the distance between the recording head and the recording 
sheet varies by a greater degree than in printers of
other types.To overcome this problem, a printer especially a wire
dot type printer, usually has a mechanism for
adjusting a relative gap length between the platen and
the recording head. However, the user must be well
skilled in selecting the optimal gap for each kind of
sheet used, and the selecting operation is cumbersome.The printer disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent
Publication No. 4-14634 is intended to overcome the
above noted problems. This printer has an encoder
that generates pulse signals in association with the
movement of the carriage from an initial position
thereof, and a control section that processes a
feedback pulse signal from the encoder. The first
instance of a carriage driving pulse motor losing
synchronism is detected from a change in the number of
pulses from the encoder due to an abutment of the
recording head against a recording sheet, and the
thickness of the recording sheet is calculated based
on the amount of movement of the carriage up to the
moment of abutment, so that the position of the
carria
