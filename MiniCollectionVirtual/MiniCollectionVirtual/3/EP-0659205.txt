<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements to hard
surface cleaners, and in particular to hard surface cleaners
containing suspended particles.Hard surface cleaners containing abrasive particles are well
known. Typical compositions comprise one or more
surfactants in solution and a plurality of abrasive
particles dispersed therein. In this art it is generally
considered necessary to ensure that the abrasive particles
remain in suspension in the composition in order that the
composition need not be vigorously shaken before use and
sedimentation or even cementing of precipitated particles is
prevented.In one sub-class of compositions, one or more surfactant
components act as a suspending agent, usually in combination
with a dissolved electrolyte. The presence of the
electrolyte causes the surfactant component(s) to thicken by
the establishment of a lamellar phase.In another sub-class of compositions, an additional non-surfactant
suspending agent, such as a clay or polymer is
present.Related compositions are known which comprise non-abrasive
particles such as hygiene agents, i.e. water-insoluble or
sparingly soluble bleaching agents and the present invention
includes such compositions within its scope. In such suspending systems, the viscosity of the product
generally varies with the shear applied. This property is
usually referred to as 'shear thinning'. The viscosity
achieved under various rates of shear is important in
determining the product properties.At low or zero shear, it is desirable that products should
exhibit relatively high viscosity for storage stability of
the suspension without sedimentation of the particles over a
reasonable shelf life. At moderate shear, it is desirable
that products should flow in order that they can be
controllably dosed. At high shear it is desirable that the
viscosity should be sufficiently low to facilitate cleaning
operations using the product.Surfactants employed as suspending agents in liquid abrasive
cleaners have included, alkyl benzene sulphonates, alcohol
ethoxylates, alkyl amido ethoxylates, fatty acid soaps and
secondary alkyl sulphonates. Combinations of these
surfactants, together with electrolytes are used to form the
suspending systems in a number of commercial products.As mentioned above, suspending surfactant system must be
both pourable and have a high yield stress, i.e. it must be
dosable and must be capable of suspending macroscopic
particles. The fine structure of such systems generally
consists of generally spherical structures ranging from
abo
