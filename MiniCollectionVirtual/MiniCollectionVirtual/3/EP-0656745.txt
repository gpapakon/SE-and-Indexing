<ABSTRACT>
A grass conditioning device, in particular of the type which is incorporated in a grass mowing machine, receives mown grass through an inlet, discharges the conditioned grass through an outlet, and consists of at least two counter-rotating cylinders. The object of the invention is to provide a grass conditioning device of this type which is flat, compact and in particular can be economically integrated in mass produced harvesters. For this purpose, several cylinders (21, 31) having substantially the same diameter form a first (2) and at least a second row (3) of cylinders. The cylinder rows (2, 3) are associated with each other, the first cylinder row (2) can be driven separately from the cylinders (31) of the other cylinder rows (3) and the at least two cylinder rows (2, 3) have different peripheral speeds.

<CLAIMS>
A device for processing stalk material, especially incorporated in a grass 
matting machine, the device being supplied with cut stalk material through an inlet 

and the processed stalk material leaving the device through an outlet, a number of 
rollers (21, 31) having substantially the same diameter and rotating in opposite 

directions making up a first row (2) and a second row (3), the rows (2, 3) being 
associated with one another,
characterised in that
 the rollers (21) in the first row (2) are drivable separately from 
the rollers (31) in the second row (3), and the peripheral speeds of the rollers (21, 

31) in the two rows (2, 3) are different. 
A device according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the shafts (32) of the rollers (31) in the second row (3) are 
fixed and the shafts (22) of the rollers (21) in the first row (2) are at least partly 

adjustably supported. 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that
 an adjustable support of all the shafts (22 or 32) of the rollers 
(21 or 31) in one row (2 or 3) is provided in such a way that the shafts are fixed 

in an adjustably supported frame (23, 24, 33). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the shafts (22 or 32) of the rollers (21 or 31) in at least one 
row (2 or 3) are individually adjustably supported. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the rows (2, 3) are disposed relative to one another so that 
the distance between the rollers in the region of the inlet (E) is greater than the 

distance between the rollers in the region of the outlet (A), the axes of the rollers 
in each row (2, 3) being disposed in a plane.  

 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the rollers (21 or 33) in a row (2 or 3) are drivable at least 
partly individually and/or together. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the different peripheral speeds of the rollers (21, 31) in the 
at least two rows (2, 3) are adjustable in dependence on an upstream cutting and 

supply device. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the ratio of the peripheral speeds between the rollers (21, 31) 
in the first row and the at least one other row (2, 3) are in the range between 1 : 

1.1 and 1 : 10. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the peripheral speed of the rollers (21 or 31) in at least one 
row (2 or 3) is designed to increase progressively towards the outlet, beginning 

from the inlet. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the rollers (21, 31) have a rough surface (grooves R) on at 
least part of their outer periphery.
