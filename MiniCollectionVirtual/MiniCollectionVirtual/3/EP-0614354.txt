<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of anti-aging of
skin. Specifically, the invention relates to novel cosmetic methods for
regulating atrophy in mammalian skin.Skin is subject to abuse by many extrinsic (environmental)
factors as well as intrinsic (chronoaging) factors. A common
extrinsic factor is exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Whether
extrinsic or intrinsic, the abuse results in wrinkling of the skin.
To many people, skin wrinkles are a reminder of the disappearance cf
youth. As a result, the elimination of wrinkles has become a
booming business in youth-conscious societies. Treatments range
frog cosmetic creams and moisturizers to various forms of cosmetic
surgery.Chronoaging results in the thinning and general degradation of
skin. As the skin naturally ages, there is a reduction in the cells
and blood vessels that supply the skin. There is also a flattening
of the dermal-epidermal junction which results in weaker mechanical
resistance of this junction. As a consequence, older persons are
more susceptive to blister formation in cases of mechanical trauma
or disease processes. (See Oikarinen, (1990) "The Aging of Skin:
Chronoaging Versus Photoaging", Photodermatal, Photoimmunol.,
Photomed., Vol. 7, pp 3-4).It is known to use salicylic acid for the treatment of acne,
see for example, US-A-4,891,227 and US-A-4,891,228, to Thaman et
al., both issued January 2, 1990.
Further, salicylic acid has been used for the
removal of wart, corns and calluses; for the treatment of psoriasis,
seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff; and for the topical treatment of
ringworm infection.
US-A-4,608,370 discloses a skin treatment composition comprising 3-7 parts salicylic
acid 8-12 parts resorcinol, 8-12 parts lactic acid and 60-90 parts ethyl alcohol for light
peeling of dead surface skin and removal of blemishes. EP-A-0
434 628 discloses compositions for anti-ageing or acne comprising vitamin A
ester and salicylic acid. Japanese Patents Gazette, week 8322, Derwent Publications
Ltd., London, GB discloses a cosmetic pack for prevention and recovery of
wrinkles containing salicylic acid and a substrate. US-A-3 821 370 discloses
a skin composition comprising phenol salt, a salicylate, resorcinol and a zinc
compound for minimizing the appearance of surface blemishes. US-A-5 017 367
discloses compositions for cleaning, moisturising and healing of skin irritations
where salicylic acid can be used as a preservative. EP-A-0 378 936 discloses
a composition for treating ageing skin comprising a salicylic acid derivative
and
