<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber optic gyroscopes used for rotation 
sensing and, more particularly, to interferometric fiber optic gyroscopes. Fiber optic gyroscopes are an attractive means with which to sense 
rotation. They can be made quite small and still be constructed to withstand considerable 
mechanical shock, temperature change, and other environmental extremes. In the absence of 
moving parts, they can be nearly maintenance free, and they have the potential to become 
economical in cost. They can also be sensitive to low rotation rates which can be a problem 
in other types of optical gyroscopes. There are various forms of optical inertial rotation sensors which use 
the well-known Sagnac effect to detect rotation about a pertinent axis thereof. These include 
active optical gyroscopes which have the gain medium contained in an optical cavity therein, 
such as the ring laser gyroscope, and passive optical gyroscopes without any gain medium in 
the primary optical path, such as the interferometric fiber optic gyroscope and the ring 
resonator fiber optic gyroscope. The avoidance of having the active medium along the 
primary optical path in the gyroscope eliminates some problems which are encountered in 
active gyroscopes, such as low rotation rate lock-in, bias drift and some causes of scale factor 
variations. Interferometric fiber optic gyroscopes typically employ a single spatial 
mode optical fiber of a substantial length, typically 100 to 2,000 meters, which length is 
formed into a coil by being wound on a core to form a closed optical path. An 
electromagnetic wave, or light wave, is introduced and split into a pair of such waves to 
propagate in opposite directions through the coil to both ultimately impinge on a 
photodetector. Rotation about the sensing axis of the core, or the coiled optical fiber, provides 
an effective optical path length increase in one rotational direction and an effective optical 
path length decrease in the opposite rotational direction for one member of this pair of 
electromagnetic waves. The opposite result occurs for the remaining member of the pair of 
electromagnetic waves for such rotation. Such path length differences between the pair of 
electromagnetic waves introduce a phase shift between those waves in interferometric fiber 
optic gyroscopes in either rotation direction, i.e. the well-known Sagnac effect. The use of 
a coiled optical fiber is desirable because the amount of phase difference shift due to rotation, 
and so the output signal,
