<ABSTRACT>
A memory controller which makes maximum use of any 
processor pipelining and runs a large number of cycles 

concurrently. The memory controller can utilize 
different speed memory devices at their desired optimal 

speeds. The functions are performed by a plurality of 
simple, interdependent state machines, each responsible 

for one small portion of the overall operation. As 
each state machine reaches has completed its function, 

it notifies a related state machine that it can now 
proceed and proceeds to wait for its next start or 

proceed indication. The next state machine operates in 
a similar fashion. The state machines responsible for 

the earlier portions of a cycle have started their 
tasks on the next cycle before the state machines 

responsible for the later portions of the cycle have 
completed their tasks. The memory controller is 

logically organized as three main blocks, a front end 
block, a memory block and a host block, each being 

responsible for interactions with its related bus and 
components and interacting with the various other 

blocks for handshaking. The memory controller operates 
in system management mode to override any write protect 

status of memory so that the SMRAM can be located in 
the main memory space and be write protected during 

normal operations but be full usable during system 
management mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to computers having system
management mode operations, particularly where the memory
for the system management mode is located in the main memory
space of the computer and accessible by conventional
applications and thus must be write protected.Microprocessor-based computer systems have been
increasing in performance at a tremendous rate. Much of this
increase has been based on the improvements in the
microprocessor itself. For example, clock speeds are
reaching those previously used only by mainframe computers.
However, affordable memory device performance has not been
increasing at the same rate. Indeed, dynamic random access
memory (DRAM) performance has flattened out recently, with
the majority of the effort being concentrated on increasing
device storage size. Thus main memory has become a
bottleneck.Cache memory systems, where a small amount of very
fast, expensive static RAM is used to store copies of the
data, have made the problem somewhat less severe, but the
designs are very complicated and expensive. Further, the
poor memory performance returns when access must be made to
main memory. So there still is a need to improve the
performance of the main memory system.Page mode memory devices provide one way to increase
memory system performance. If consecutive accesses are made
to the same row address, referred to as the same page, only
column addresses need be provided. This allows a dramatic
reduction in cycle time for those cases, referred to as page
hits. This is a quick gain and relatively easily made by
itself, but more performance is always desired.In many processors, the address is provided before the 
data portion of the cycle. This is referred to as pipelining
and allows a performance increase in the memory systems. All
of the address decoding can be started before the data
portion begins, so that partially parallel operations can
occur.In most cases this overlap is somewhat minimal, one or
two clock cycles, as the related systems cannot handle much
more complexity. For example, the memory controller is.
conventionally built as a synchronous controller, based on
a major state machine to control events and advancing on the
processor clock edge. As the 'complexities of the
microprocessor and the computer system increase, the
conventional memory controller design becomes very limiting.
It is exceedingly difficult to build a major state machine
to handle all the possible cases. The complexity is
daunting, if not overwhelming. As a result, numerous
potential performance

A method for operating a computer system having a
system management mode which is operable in the main memory

space (168,170) of the computer, comprising the steps of:

providing an indication (HWP) that a portion of the
main memory space is write protected;
determining (SMIACT) when system management mode is
active; and
overriding said indication of write
protection when system management mode is dete
rmined to be
active, so that the main memory space is writable, MN.

   
characterised in that

   read access to said system management mode
memory space is available when said system management mode

is inactive and said memory space is write-protected.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of:

performing write operations to main memory (168,170)
and returning an operation complete signal (PBRDY) when the

write protect indication (HWP) is not provided; and
wherein said step of overriding prevents the returning
of only the operation complete signal (PBRDY) without

performing a write operation to memory and causes writing to
main memory and return of an operation complete signal when

the write protect indication is provided and system
management mode is determined to be active.
A computer system having a system management mode which
is operable in the main memory space (168,170) of the

computer, the computer system comprising:

means (156) for providing an indication (HWP) that a
portion of the main memory space is write protected;
means (156) for determining when system management mode
is active; and
means (156) for overriding said indication of write 
protection (HWP) when system management mode is determined

to be active, so that the main memory space is writable,

is inactive and said memory space is write-protected.
The computer system of claim 3, wherein the computer
system utilizes an operation complete signal (PBRDY) after

completion of a memory operation, the computer system

means (156) for performing write operations to main
memory (168,170) and returning an operation complete signal

(PBRDY) when the write protect indication (HWP) is not

wherein said means for overriding (156) prevents said
means for performing write operations from returning only

the operation complete signal without performing a write
operation to memory and causes said means for performing

write operations to write to main memory and return an
operation complete signal (PBRDY) when the write protect

indication is provided and system management mode is
determined to be active.
