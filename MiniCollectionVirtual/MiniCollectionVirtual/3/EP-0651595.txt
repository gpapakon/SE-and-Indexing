occur, consisting of a pyramid (1) having as its base

ratio h/D1 also of the golden type, there also being 

provided at least one pair of arms (3) and (4)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and an 
associated device for neutralizing the effects of 
electromagnetic fields inside areas and/or volumes 
inside which said fields occur. It is known that the presence of electromagnetic fields 
of any origin inside areas and/or volumes gives rise to 
environmental pollution phenomena which are harmful 
both for any vegetation as well as for fauna and man. It is known, for example, that the prolonged exposure 
of the eyes to the rays of a video terminal such as 
that of a computer is harmful for the eyes themselves 
and it is also known that agriculture fields exposed to 
the electromagnetic waves of high-voltage lines are 
affected, with a reduction in the productivity of the 
crops. The technical problem which is posed, therefore, is 
that of neutralizing the effects of electromagnetic 
fields present inside open areas and/or volumes such as 
closed environments in order to reduce significantly 
the harmful effects of said electromagnetic fields. These results are obtained by the present invention 
which envisages a process for neutralizing the effects 
of electromagnetic fields inside areas and/or volumes 
in which said fields occur, which comprises the 
following phases:  determination of the direction of North-South 
orientation of the area "A" subject to the 
electromagnetic field, corresponding determination of the direction of East-West 
orientation of the same area, determination of a segment arranged along the 
orientation N-S and of a segment arranged along E-W 
such that they constitute respectively the greater 
diagonal D2 and the smaller diagonal d3 of a rhombus 6 
inside which the area subject to neutralization 
treatment is inscribed and such that their ratio is of 
the golden type; arrangement, in the region of each vertex N,E,S,W, of 
the above-defined rhombus, of a pyramid device 
according to the present invention (1N,1E,1S,1W), each 
oriented with the larger diagonal parallel to the 
direction N-S, arrangement, in the containers (3N,3S,4E,4W) 
corresponding to the respective cardinal point at which 
they are located, of a liquid, vibration of which 
resonates with the specific frequency of the cardinal 
point in question, i.e.:
 
North: frequencies C = 10 Hz ; E = 40 Hz
 
South: frequencies A = 2.5 Hz ; G = 160 Hz
 
East: frequency D = 20 Hz
 
West: frequencies B = 5 Hz ; F = 80 Hz,
arrangement of a further pyramid device (1C) at the 
centre of the above-defined rhombus,  arrangement, in the central container (5C) of said 
pyramid
