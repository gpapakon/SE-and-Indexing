<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic elastomer composition is provided 
which is highly durable and free from oxidative 

deterioration when exposed to elevated temperature as in 
molding and also ambient temperature at which an end 

product thereof is used. These advantageous features 
are attributable to the use of a hydrogenated oil of the 

class disclosed which serves effectively to suppress the 
tendency of an elastomer undergoing gelation or 

cross-linking particularly when heated in the 
atmosphere. The hydrogenated oil is derivable from 

hydrogenation of a liquid product resulting from 
thermally treating a coal tar or distillates thereof at 

above 400°C; a liquid product resulting from thermally 
treating at above 400°C a petroleum crude oil, 

distillates thereof, or a liquid hydrocarbon derived 
from catalytic cracking, hydrogenative cracking or 

catalytic reforming of petroleum distillates; or a 
thermally cracked tar resulting from thermally cracking 

a petroleum crude oil or distillates thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic 
elastomer composition for use in the manufacture of a 
variety of molded articles. Thermoplastic elastomers are reputed for their 
unique performance thanks to the combined physical 
properties of rubber and plastics. However, due to a 
relatively short history of their research and 
development, such elastomers still have much to be 
desired for improvement particularly with respect to 
deterioration by oxidation. It has been proposed to 
certain oxidation inhibitors suitable for use with a 
selected class of rubbers or plastics. Such oxidation 
inhibitors are however not quite economically feasible 
and not entirely satisfactory in efficacy particularly 
in view of an extremely high temperature at which an 
elastomer can be molded as compared to rubber. Therefore, the present invention seeks to provide 
a thermoplastic elastomer composition which is highly 
durable and substantially free from oxidative  
 
deterioration during its molding at elevated 
temperature, and also after it is molded into a finished 
article for use at room temperature. This objective is 
attained by the use of a selected amount of a 
hydrogenated oil derived from thermal and hydrogenative 
treatment of a petroleum tar or petroleum fraction 
(including petroleum distillation residues). According to the invention, there is provided a 
thermoplastic elastomer composition which comprises 100 
parts by weight of a thermoplastic elastomer and from 
0.1 to 20 parts by weight of a hydrogenated oil derived 
from hydrogenation of either of: 
i) a liquid product resulting from thermally 
treating a coal tar or distillates thereof at above 
400°C; ii) a liquid product resulting from thermally 
treating at above 400°C a petroleum crude oil, 
distillates thereof, or a liquid hydrocarbon derived 
from catalytic cracking, hydrogenative cracking or 
catalytic reforming of petroleum distillates; or iii) a thermally cracked tar resulting from 
thermally cracking a petroleum crude oil or distillates 
thereof. The invention will be better understood from the 
following description and with reference to the 
accompanying drawings. 
Figure 1 graphically displays the relationship  
 
between kneading time, temperature and torque of the 
elastomer compositions of Inventive Examples 1a, 1b and 
Comparative Example 1, respectively; Figure 2 is a graphical display of the molecular 
weight distribution of an elastomer composition of 
Comparative Example 1; Figure 3 is a graphical display of the molecular 
weight
