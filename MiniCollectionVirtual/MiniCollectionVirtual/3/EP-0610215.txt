<ABSTRACT>
Novel methods for assaying a nucleic acid analyte are provided, which employ polynucleotides having oligonucleotide sequences substantially homologous to a sequence of interest in the analyte, where the presence or absence of hybridization at a predetermined stringency provides for the release of a label from a support. Particularly, various techniques are employed for binding a label to a support, whereupon periodate cleavage of a linkage between the label and support results in release of label, which can be detected as indicative of the presence of a particular oligonucleotide sequence in a sample. The method finds use in diagnosis of disease, genetic monitoring, and analysis of nucleic acid mixtures.

<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYNUCLEOTIDE DETERMINATION WITHSELECTABLE CLEAVAGE SITESDescription Technical Field The invention relates generally to the incorporation of selectably cleavable sites into oligonucleotide chains, and more particularly relates to novel reagents useful for introducing periodate-cleavable linkages into oligonucleotide chains. The invention also relates to methods of using the novel reagents in biochemical assays.BackgroundThe ability to synthesize oligonucleotide sequences at will and to clone polynucleotide sequences prepared by synthetic procedures or obtained from naturally occurring sources has greatly expanded the opportunities for detecting the presence of specific sequences in an extended oligonucleotide sequence, e.g., chromosome(s) , mixture of sequences, mRNAs, or the like. Interest in specific sequences may involve the diagnosis of the presence of pathogens, the determination of the presence of alleles, the presence of lesions in a host genome, the detection of a particular mRNA or the monitoring of a modification of a cellular host, to mention only a few illustrative opportunities. While the use of antibodies to perform assays diagnostic of the presence of various antigens in samples has seen an explosive expansion in techniques and protocols since the advent of radioim unoassay, there has been until recently 

 no parallel activity in the area of the DNA probes. Therefore, for the most part, detection of sequences has involved various hybridization techniques requiring the binding of a polynucleotide sequence to a support and employing a radiolabeled probe.In view of the increasing capability to produce oligonucleotide sequences in large amounts in an economical way, the attention of investigators will be directed to providing for simple, accurate and efficient techniques for detecting specific oligonucleotides sequences. Desirably, these techniques will be rapid, minimize the opportunity for technician error, be capable of automation, and allow for simple and accurate methods of detection. Toward this end, there have already been efforts to provide for means to label oligonucleotide probes with labels other than radioisotopes and for improving the accuracy of transfer of DNA sequences to a support from a gel, as well as improved methods for derivatizing oligonucleotides to allow for binding to a label. There continues to be a need for providing new protocols which allow for flexibility in detecting DNA sequences of interest in a variety of situations where the DNA may come from diverse
