<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of a flat product (4) made of zirconium alloy consisting of a strip, tape or sheet (4) between 0.4 and 3 mm in thickness, this process including, after a cold rolling operation, a reheating and maintaining in the beta domain of the said product, the said maintaining being followed by a rapid cooling, characterised in that the said reheating and the said maintaining are performed by means of lamps (3) with infrared rays of wavelength of between 0.8 and 5 micrometres providing over the width of the product (4) a maximum difference in temperatures of less than 35 DEG C, the said width being between 50 and 600 mm. The invention applies to the manufacture of securing and spacing components for nuclear reactors.

A process for the manufacture of a flat product (4, 41) of zirconium alloy
consisting of a strip, band (41) or sheet (4) of a thickness of between

0.4 and 3 mm, this process comprising, after cold rolling, heating and
maintaining in the beta range of said product, said maintaining being

followed by rapid cooling and possibly by annealing, characterised in that
said heating and said maintaining are carried out using infra-red lamps

(3) with a wavelength of between 0.8 and 5 micrometres which give a
maximum temperature difference (ΔT1) over the width of the product of less

than 35°C, said width being between 50 and 600 mm.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that said lamps (3)
comprise infra-red tubes placed in the longitudinal direction of said

product (4, 41), each tube being controlled individually.
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in that said temperature
difference (ΔT1) is less than 25°C.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
said alloy is Zircaloy 2 or Zircaloy 4.
A process according to Claim 4, characterised in that the rapid cooling
of the product comprises cooling of 40 to 100°C/s between 1000 and 800°C.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that said heating and said maintaining are carried out in the beta range

with infra-red beam lamps which radiate on one face (40) of the product
(4, 41), and one or more white refractory/refractories (50) placed at

least 30 mm from the other face of the product.
A process according to any one of Claims 4 or 5, characterised in that the
product (4) is heated to a temperature of between 1020 and 1060°C before

it is rapidly cooled, the product being of a thickness of between 0.4 and
1.4 mm, and the temperature increase time being between 15 and 40 seconds. 
A process according to any one of Claims 4 or 5, characterised in that the
product (4) is heated to a temperature of between 1020 and 1060°C before

it is rapidly cooled, the product being of a thickness of between 1.4 and
3 mm, and the temperature increase time being between 30 and 80 seconds.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that
said maintaining in the beta range is for 5 to 30 seconds above 980°C.
A process according to Claim 7, characterised in that said heating,
maintaining and rapid cooling operations are carried out in succession,

said flat product (41) circulating amongst an assembly of infra-red tubes
(3) and a refractory (50) placed at least 30 mm away from the product

(41), the two faces of the product being protected by neutral gas, and
then circulating through rapid cooling means (9), for example through

water or a jet of neutral gas.
A process according to Claim 7, characterised in that said heating,
maintaining and rapid cooling operations are carried out in succession,

said flat product (41) circulating between two assemblies of infra-red
tubes (3, 30) which symmetrically heat each of its two faces, the two

faces of the product being protected by neutral gas, and then circulating
through rapid cooling means (9), for example water or a jet of neutral

gas.
