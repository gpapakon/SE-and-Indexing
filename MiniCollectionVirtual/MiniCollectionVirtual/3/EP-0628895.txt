<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a water-resistant timepiece comprising a glass-bezel unit (1, 30) which can be rotated relative to the band (4), in which a seal (10) comprising at least one active portion (11) is arranged between the said glass-bezel unit and the said band (4). An optional fixing means (20) makes it possible to assemble the fixed and revolving units. Moreover, the invention also comprises the seal allowing the production of the said timepiece.

<CLAIMS>
Timepiece comprising a crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) 
permitting dismantling of this unit (1, 30) from above and 

capable of being moved rotatingly relative to the caseband 
(4), a joining gasket (10) being disposed between the said 

crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) and the said caseband (4) in a 
manner in which the assembly formed by the crystal-bezel 

unit (1, 30), the joining gasket (10) and the caseband (4) 
is fluid-tight, the said joining gasket (10) being fixed to 

one of the fixed (4) or rotating parts (1, 30) 
characterized in that the said joining gasket (10) includes 

at least one active portion (11) formed by an extension of 
pointed cross-section oriented in a predetermined direction 

relative to the main body forming the joining gasket (10), 
and in that the said crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) can be displaced 

axially relative to the caseband (4), particularly 
with a view to executing the said dismantling from above. 
Timepiece according to claim 1 wherein the active 
portion (11) of the gasket (10) cooperates with an adjacent 

wall of the caseband (4) in order to obtain a snug fit. 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 1 or 2 
whose said active portion (11) is oriented substantially 

radially. 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 1 or 2 
whose said active portion (11) is oriented substantially 

axially. 
Timepiece according to claim 4 wherein an axial 
displacement of said crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) in a manner 

whereby the crystal moves closer to the dial (6) brings 
about an increase in the axial force on the said active 

portion (11) oriented substantially axially. 
Timepiece according to claim 4 wherein an axial 
displacement of the crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) is a function 

of the force exerted by the ambient pressure to which 
the timepiece is subjected.  

 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 1 to 6 
wherein the crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) is fixed to the 

caseband (4) by a fixing means (20). 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 1 to 6 
wherein the crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) is fixed to the 

caseband (4) via the joining gasket (10). 
Timepiece according to claim 7, wherein the said 
fixing means (20) is disposed along the inner face (31) of 

the bezel (30). 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 7 or 9, 
wherein the said fixing means (20) is integrated in the 

said joining gasket (10). 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 7 or 9, 
wherein the said joining gasket (10) is disposed in a 

groove (33) made in the outer face (32) of the bezel (30). 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein the lower face of the said crystal (1) is fixed to 

the upper part of the said bezel (30). 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein the dial (6) is fixed to the crystal-bezel unit (1, 

30) in a manner to enable turning simultaneously with the 
said crystal-bezel unit (1, 30). 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein the said crystal-bezel unit (1, 30) is made in one 

piece. 
Timepiece according to claim 14, wherein the said 
crystal (1) is extended on the outside along a portion of 

the rim of the caseband (4), and wherein a joining gasket 
(10) is disposed between the extension of the crystal (1) 

and the rim of the caseband (4).
