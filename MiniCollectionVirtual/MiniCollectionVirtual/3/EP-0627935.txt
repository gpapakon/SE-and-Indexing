<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an improved vaccine against Brucella abortus which permits differentiation between vaccinated and field strain infected cattle. The vaccine can be administered in two different forms: (1) cell envelopes isolated from an O polysaccharide antigen deficient, stable transposon mutant of B. abortus or (2) an O polysaccharide antigen deficient, stable transposon mutant of B. abortus.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED VACCINE AGAINST BRUCELLA ABORTUSThe present invention relates to an improved vaccine against Brucella abortus. Specifically, the invention is a novel vaccine in which specific antigens of Brucella abortus induce an immunological response which provides protective immunity yet permits differentiation between field strain infected and vaccinated cattle. This novel vaccine is made from either an O polysaccharide antigen deficient transposon mutant of B. abortus or from cell envelopes isolated from such a transposon mutant.Brucella abortus are gram-negative coccobacilli that affect the reproductive system of cattle. The organism is a facultative intracellular parasite capable of causing spontaneous abortion, reduced milk production, delayed conception in cows and sterility in bulls. Brucellosis in humans and laboratory animals does not ordinarily involve the reproductive system. In these cases systemic dissemination of the organism occurs mainly through the blood to the reticuloendothelial system organs. The immunological response of the host can stop and reverse this invasive process. However, the ability of this organism to invade and survive within host macrophages compromises the ability of the host immune system to completely eliminate infection. This frequently results in the recurrence of infection with consequences identical to primary infection.Stimulation of a protective immune response in cattle is achieved by vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine B. abortus strain 19, however, complete characterization of the mechanism of protective immunity has not been performed. Primary focus has been placed on the outer membrane components including lipopolysaccharide (LPS or O polysaccharide antigen), native hapten, polysaccharide B and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) (Bundle, D.R., J.W.
