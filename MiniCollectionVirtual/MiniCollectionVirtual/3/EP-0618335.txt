A walling element intended to be used in a
building, comprising a composite plate (1) with at

least one layer (2) in a thermal insulating material
provided with crosspieces (3) on at least one of its

sides, the crosspieces (3) defining an air passage (5)
in at least two directions parallel to the plate (1) to

allow air to enter the building, characterised in that
the composite plate (1) also comprises at least one

layer of hydrophilic resistant material (4) set against
the crosspieces (3) of the layer of thermal insulating

material, said hydrophilic material (4) forming a
reservoir of humidity which absorbs humidity during

humid periods and restores humidity when the incoming
air is dry.
A walling element according to Claim 1, in
which the hydrophilic resistant material is plaster.
A walling element according to one or the
other of Claims 1 or 2, in which the layer (1) of

hydrophilic resistant material is pierced by holes (6)
all identical. 
A walling element according to Claim 3, in
which the holes (6) are blind and open onto the face of

the layer (1) of hydrophilic resistant material (4)
which is opposite to the layer of thermal insulating

material (2).
A walling element according to any one of the
preceding claims, in which the composite plate (1)

comprises a layer of acoustic insulation resistant
material.
Flooring of a building comprising a support
walling (7) approximately horizontal, walling elements

according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, set on the
support walling (7) with their layer (1) of hydrophilic

resistant material (4), or one of their layers (1) of
hydrophilic resistant material (4) directed upwards,

the air passages (5) of the different elements of the
walling communicating together horizontally and being

linked to an incoming air entry (12) from outside and
to an air exit (13) towards the interior of the

building, the means of heating (9) being set on the
layer of hydrophilic resistant material (4) directed

upwards and covered by a facing layer (8).
Flooring according to Claim 6 in which the
facing layer is a coating (8) of cement or a self-levelling

coat formed on top of the layer (1) of
hydrophilic resistant material (4), an impermeable film

set between the coating (8) and the layer of
hydrophilic resistant material (4) in order to avoid

any contact between the layer (1) of hydrophilic
resistant material (4) and the coating (8), and the

means of heating (9) are embedded in the coating (8). 
Flooring according to Claim 6, in which the
facing layer is a dry coating, the means of heating (9)

being embedded in a bed of sand and the dry coating
being set on the bed of sand.
A building facade comprising a support walling
(10) approximately vertical, walling elements according

to any one of Claims 1 to 5 fixed to the support
walling (10), with their layer of hydrophilic resistant

material (4) or one of their layers of hydrophilic
resistant material (4) directed towards the exterior of

the building and a facing layer (11) to isolate the
layer of hydrophilic resistant material (4) from bad

weather, the air passages (5) of the different walling
elements being linked to an air entry (16)

communicating with the outside atmosphere and with an
air exit (13) towards the interior of the building.
A facade according to Claim 9, in which said
support walling is set so as to be exposed to the sun

during at least part of the day.
A system for air renewal comprising a facade
according to Claim 10, an auxiliary air entry (14) to

bring in air at ambient atmospheric temperature, said
auxiliary air entry communicating directly with the

outside atmosphere, the system for air renewal also
comprising means (15) for communicating said air exit

(13) selectively either with the air passages (5a) of
the walling elements of said facade exposed to the sun,

or with the auxiliary air entry (14).
A system for air renewal of a building,
comprising at least one flooring and one ceiling each

equipped with walling elements according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, in which the walling elements of the

ceiling comprising air passages (5b) which communicate
together horizontally as a whole and are linked to an

air entry (16) which communicates with the outside of
the building, the walling elements of the flooring

comprising air passages (5c) which communicate together
horizontally and communicate on the one hand with the

air passages (5b) of the elements of the ceiling
walling, and on the other hand with an air exit (13)

towards the interior of the building.
A system of air renewal according to Claim
12, comprising a facade according to Claim 10 whose air

passages (5a) communicate with the air passages (5b) of
the walling elements of the ceiling, an auxiliary air

entry (14) to bring in air at atmospheric ambient
temperature, and also comprising means (34) for

selective connection of the air passages (5c) of the
walling elements of the flooring either to the

auxiliary air entry (14) or to the air passages (5b) of
the walling elements of the ceiling.
A system of air renewal of a building
comprising at least one flooring or ceiling presenting

walling elements according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
and also comprising a heat pump (21) to extract heat

from the air exiting the building, the heat pump (21)
receiving air coming into the building through air

passages (5) of walling elements, the system of air
renewal (21) also comprising selective means for either

heating the air coming into the building by means of

the heat pump or cooling the air coming into the
building by means of the heat pump, or not acting on 

the air coming into the building by means of the heat
pump.
A system of air renewal according to Claim
14, in which the heat pump (21) is also used to heat

the water of a water-heater (22).
A system of air renewal of a building
comprising at least one flooring or one ceiling

presenting walling elements according any one of Claims
1 to 5, and also comprising a blower (35, 35') to

inject air taken from outside the building into the air
passages (5).
