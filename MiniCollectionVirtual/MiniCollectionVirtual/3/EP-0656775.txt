<DESCRIPTION>
Bupropion hydrochloride (WellbutrinR) is a marketed antidepressant. It is chemically 
known as (±)-2-(tert-butylamino)-3'-chloropropiophenone hydrochloride. (See U.S. 
Patents 3,819,706 and 3,885,046). Also see Merck Index, Eleventh Edition, entry No. 
1488. In usage, bupropion hydrochloride is sold in the form of an instant release tablet 
wherein greater than 75% of bupropion hydrochloride is released from the tablet 
dissolution media in 45 minutes (See 1993 Physicians Desk Reference (PDR), pages 
842 to 844). The PDR indicates bupropion hydrochloride as presently sold in an 
instant release tablet as being associated with seizures in approximately 0.4% 
(4/1000) patients treated at doses of up to 450 mg per day. In studies to date, the risk 
of seizures seem to be strongly associated, in part, with use of instant release tablets. In order to reduce the seizure rate, it has been determined after experimentation that a 
controlled sustained release of bupropion hydrochloride should be employed. Prior art with respect to this invention is to be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,687,660 
which discloses controlled sustained release tablets containing bupropion 
hydrochloride. The present invention provides an improved product in that it provides sustained 
release of the active ingredient as well as ease of manufacture over that disclosed in 
U.S. Patent 4,687,660. After almost three years of work and testing, the present invention is now able to 
provide a controlled sustained release, sometimes also referred to as a sustained 
release (SR) tablet with improved properties and which has a shelf life over one year 
(i.e., there is less than 10% loss most preferably less than about 5% loss breakdown), 
of buproprion hydrochloride) in one year of storage at room temperature 15 to 25°C 
(59 to 77°F) at 35 to 60% relative humidity. For example, with a tablet containing 
100 mg of bupropion hydrochloride (label strength) the tablet will preferably contain 
no less than about 95mg of bupropion hydrochloride after one year in storage (shelf  
 
life). As used herein, the term "tablet" includes the term "caplet", which is the word 
used to describe a tablet termed substantially in the shape of a capsule. The oral administration of the controlled release tablets of this invention to treat 
depression in humans will be under the jurisdiction of the physician; however, tablets 
for a 75kg (150 pound) human will ordinarily be given one to three times per day to 
provide a total daily dosage of 100 to 450mg per day for a
