<ABSTRACT>
An image communication apparatus includes a 
reception unit for receiving image data, a first 

controller for storing the image data received by the 
reception unit in a memory, and counting the page 

number the reception image data, a recording unit for 
recording an image on a sheet on the basis of the image 

data stored in the memory, a storage unit having a 
plurality of trays for sorting and storing sheets on 

which images are recorded by the recording unit, the 
plurality of trays having a first tray having a small 

sheet stackable number and a second tray having a large 
sheet stackable number, and a second controller for 

selecting the first tray when the page number counted 
by the first controller is equal to or smaller than a 

predetermined page number, and selecting the second 
tray when the counted page number is larger than the 

predetermined page number, thereby storing the sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
communication apparatus having a plurality of storage
units for storing sheets on which reception images are
recorded.A facsimile or image formation apparatus having a
sorter is known, for example, from JP-A-03 162365.However, sheets on which reception images are
recorded as a large number of pages cannot be
discharged on each bin tray in a conventional sorter
due to a small stackable number, resulting in
inconvenience.More specifically, regardless of the number of
received pages, sheets on which images are recorded are
discharged on a designated bin tray. When the number
of output sheets exceeds or is found to exceed the
stackable number of this bin tray, the output is
interrupted. Non-output information is preferably
output to an adjacent bin tray. However, when this bin
tray is full, sheets are output to any empty bin tray.
If impossible, the transmitted information is stored in
an image memory. In any case, a series of pieces of 
information are divided, resulting in complex handling
of a reception document.A confidential received image is recorded when a
receiver inputs his password. Although the receiver is
present near a facsimile apparatus, a recorded sheet is
discharged to a bin tray which is not easily accessed
by the receiver.An image communication apparatus outputs a
communication management report except for sheets of
reception and copy images. However, a communication
management report periodically output from the
facsimile apparatus is useful for only a specific user.
When one facsimile apparatus is shared by a plurality
of users, this communication management report is left
on the bin tray.In a sorter having only a lead-through sensor
(i.e., a sensor for detecting a specific one of a
plurality of bin trays, which has a sheet therein), an
image communication apparatus cannot detect that sheets
are removed from the remaining bin trays if any sheet
is present in any bin tray.In an image communication apparatus of this type,
although sheets of reception and copy images are
removed from the bin trays, the communication
management report such as a communication end report,
an error message, or a memory transmission end report
discharged on a bin tray tends to be left in this bin 
tray. When such a communication management report is
discharged on a bin tray whose paper sheet is detected
by a through sensor, the through sensor always detects
the presence of a sheet due to the presence of the
communication management report left in the bin tray
although

<CLAIMS>
An image communication apparatus comprising:

reception means for receiving image data;
recording means (
101
) for recording an image on a
recording sheet (

520
) used for stacking
discharged sheets (
P
) on which images are recorded by said
recording means (
101
);
characterized by
memory means for storing said image data received by
said reception means;
said recording means (
101
