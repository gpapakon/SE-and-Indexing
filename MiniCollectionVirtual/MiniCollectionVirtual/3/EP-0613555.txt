<ABSTRACT>
A planar polarographic probe for determining the lambda value of gas mixtures, in particular exhaust gas of internal combustion engines, is disclosed, as well as a process for producing the same. The planar polarographic probe has a pumping cell A with outer and inner pumping electrodes (11 and 16) arranged on a solid electrolyte (14). The gas to be measured can be supplied to the inner pumping electrode (16) through a diffusion barrier. The probe further has one front and two lateral frontal surfaces. The diffusion barrier is designed as a diffusion layer (19) which at least partially covers the inner pumping electrode (16) and which is exposed to the gas to be measured at at least one frontal surface of the probe. To produce the planar polarographic probe one uses a multiple printed panel, on which the diffusion layer (19) is applied in such a way that the diffusion layer (19) overlaps at least the front edge of the multiple printed panel and when the individual printed panels are singled out, the diffusion layer is exposed.

Planar polarographic probe for determining the
lambda value of gas mixtures, in particular of exhaust

gases from combustion engines, having outer and inner
pump electrodes (11, 16) arranged on a ceramic support,

and having a diffusion barrier which is designed in the
form of a diffusion layer (19) and at least partly

covers the inner pump electrode (16), and via which the
gas to be measured can be fed to the inner pump

electrode (16), the ceramic support forming a large
face in the diffusion direction of the gas to be

measured and having at least one front and two lateral
end faces, characterized in that the diffusion layer

(19) extends in the region of the inner pump electrode
(16) over the entire width of the large face of the

ceramic support in such a way that the diffusion layer
(19) is exposed to the gas to be measured on the front

and on the two side end faces of the ceramic support.
Probe according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the region of the large face of the ceramic

support free of the diffusion layer is provided with a
compensating layer (17).
Process for producing a planar polarographic
probe for determining the lambda value of gas mixtures,

in particular of exhaust gases from combustion engines,
having outer and inner pump electrodes (11, 16)

arranged on a ceramic support, and having a diffusion
layer (19) which at least partly covers the inner pump

electrode (16), a multiple groove (M) having a 
multiplicity of grooves (S) arranged parallel next to

one another along a front edge being provided,
characterized in that the diffusion layer (19) is

applied to the multiple groove (M) simultaneously, for
the grooves (S) arranged next to one another, in such a

way that the diffusion layer (19) projects surface-wide
on the front edge of the individual grooves (S) and on

the two side edges of the multiple groove (M).
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the region of the multiple groove (M) free of the

diffusion layer is provided with a compensating layer
(17) which has a thickness approximately equal to that

of the diffusion layer (19).
