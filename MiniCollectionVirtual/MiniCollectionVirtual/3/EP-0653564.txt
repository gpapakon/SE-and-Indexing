<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a centrifugal pump with a single-blade impeller (3), whose central suction mouth remote from the drive shaft (4) is in alignment with the inlet opening (6) of the pump chamber (2), the inlet opening forming an annular collar (9) which projects into the impeller interior in such a way that the inner end (7a) of the impeller blade (7) forms a narrow gap (width S) with the outer circumference of the collar (9).

A centrifugal pump having a single-vane impeller (3) whose
central suction mouth remote from the driving shaft (4) is

aligned with the inlet opening (6) of the pump chamber (2), the
inlet opening (6) forming an annular collar (9) which so projects

into the interior of the impeller that the inner end (7a) of the
impeller vane (7) cooperates with the outer generated surface of

the collar (9) to form a narrow gap (width S) characterized in
that adjoining the outside of the collar (9) is a coaxial toothed

rim (15) whose teeth are directed substantially radially.
A centrifugal pump according to claim 1, characterized in
that mounted in the pump chamber side wall (5) formed with the

inlet (6) is an end plate (11) which forms the collar (9)
directly or via an insert (12).
A centrifugal pump according to claim 2, characterized in
that the insert (12) forming the collar (9) lines after the

fashion of a bush at least that zone of the inlet (6) which is
adjacent the impeller (3).
A centrifugal pump according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the end of the chamber side wall (5)

adjacent the impeller (3) forms, more particularly via an end
plate (11), around the inlet (6) a spiral-shaped groove (13)

through which solids entering between the impeller (3) and the
chamber side wall (5) can be moved outwards. 
A centrifugal pump according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the coaxial toothed rim (15) adjoins the

outside of the collar on the end plate (11).
A centrifugal pump according to claim 5, characterized in
that the end face (16) of the inner end (7a) of the impeller vane

(7) adjacent the end plate (11) lies at a small distance above
the toothed rim (15).
A centrifugal pump according to claims 5 or 6, characterized
in that the spiral groove (13) adjoins the outside of the toothed

rim (15).
A centrifugal pump according to one of claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the width (b) of the teeth and therefore of

the toothed rim (15) is substantially equal to the width (B) of
the end face (16) of the inner end (7a) of the impeller vane (7).
A centrifugal pump according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the end face lower end of the front side of

the impeller vane has a rounding with a radius (R) through which
fibrous substances are drawn in.
