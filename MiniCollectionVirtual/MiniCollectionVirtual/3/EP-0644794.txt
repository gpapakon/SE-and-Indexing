<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter bag assembly which may 
be used in a filtering apparatus e.g. for filtering juice from fruit, 
and has the features of the first part of claim 1 (US-A-4 892 665), 
and also to a filter press which may be used with the filter bag 
assembly of this invention. US-A-4,892,665 shows a plurality of press plates or racks 
which have filter bags disposed between them. In operation 
the bags are suitably filled with the fruit which is to be 
pressed, and the press plates or racks are moved together 
to squeeze the juice from the fruit. At the completion of 
the pressing operation the press racks and the bags are 
turned upside down and the pomace or press cake is then 
removed from the bags. Invariably the press cake sticks to 
one side or the other of the filter bag. While ideally the 
press cake (or pomace) should fall from the bags when they 
are shaken, this frequently doesn't occur. This then 
requires the press operator to free the press cake from the 
bag by inserting a paddle-like instrument between the press 
cake and the side of the filter bag to which the press cake 
is sticking. As this is a time consuming operation, it 
reduces the potential through-put of the machine. In other presses differing designs have been utilized 
for facilitating the removal of the press cake from the 
press. One such design is shown in U. S. Patent 3,289,844 
to Emele which discloses a sinusoidal web have filter 
portions disposed between the press racks. The filter  
 
portions will be caused to be shifted out of the plane of 
the press cake when the press is opened to dislodge the 
press cake. U. S. Patent 5,045,182 to Takashima discloses a plural 
filter press employing vertical filter cloths which may be 
vibrated to dislodge the press cake. Another design is shown in U. S. Patent 4,900,436 to 
Iwatani who discloses jolting means for dislodging the 
press cake from a filter press. While all of the above press devices are well known in 
the art, it is still desirable to provide an improved 
filter bag design which will provide a means for 
facilitating the removal of the press cake from the filter 
bag upon the completion of the filtering operation and 
which, when used in a filter press, will facilitate the 
pressing of juice from the pulp which forms a press cake. It is the problem of the present invention to provide a 
an improved filter bag assembly which will facilitate the 
discharge of a press cake when inverted, as well as a novel 
apparatus for pressing juice from

<CLAIMS>
A filter bag assembly (10, 110) which may be used 
within a press assembly (12); the filter bag assembly (10, 

110) comprising:
 
   a bag (50, 150) when assembled having a closed bottom 

(52, 152) and four sides (54 - 60, 154 - 160), 
each side having an upper edge (62, 162), the 

sides including two opposed narrow sides (54 -56, 
154 - 156) and two opposed wide sides (58 - 60, 

158 - 160) made of a porous material, the upper 
edges of the sides defining an open top when the 

bag is in its normal upright contents receiving 
position;
 
characterized by
 
   providing opposed flaps (64 - 66, 164 - 166) made of a 

suitable filter material, each flap having upper 
and lower edges, the flaps being secured only at 

their upper edges to the insides of the two wide 
sides (58 - 60, 158 - 160), the flaps extending 

towards the bottom of the bags, the flaps 
extending nearly over the whole area of the wide 

sides of the filter bag; and
 
   retaining means (72, 78 -80, 178 - 180) engaging the 

bottom of the bag when the bag is inverted to 
prevent the bottom of the bag from falling down. 
The filter bag assembly (10, 110) as set forth in 
claim 1 wherein there are at least two flaps (64 - 66, 

164 - 166) on each of the wide sides (58 - 60, 158 - 160), 
the flaps on each side being arranged in tiers with the 

lower edge of one flap overlying the top edge of an 
adjacent flap on the same side. 
The filter bag assembly (10, 110) as set forth in 
claim 2 wherein the upper edge of the top flap (64, 164) on 

each side (58 - 60, 158 - 160) is spaced below the top edge 
of the side of the bag to which it is secured so that, when  

 
the bag is inverted and the bottom of the bag is held from 

falling, the lower edge of the top flaps (64, 164) extend 
only a short distance below the top edge of the bag, 

whereby, when the bag is moved back to its normal upright 

position, the flaps will fall back into the bag without 
draping over the upper edges of the sides. 
The filter bag assembly (10, 110) as set forth in 
claim 1 wherein all the sides (54 - 60, 154 - 160) of the 

bag (10, 110) and the bottom of the bag are made from a 
single unitary piece of porous cloth (--, 112). 
The filter bag assembly as set forth in claim 4 
wherein the sides (154 - 160) and bottom (152) of the bag 

(110) are formed by folding the bag and securing the folded 
bag with temporary fastener means, such as loop and hook 

type fasteners (116 - 118, 122). 
The filter bag assembly as set forth in claim 1 or 4 
wherein the wide sides of the bag and the flaps are made of 

differing materials, the sides and bottom of the bag being 
made from a strong material which is capable of 

withstanding relatively high tension forces, and the flaps 
being made of a filter cloth which is capable of filtering 

out relatively fine particles. 
The filter bag assembly (10, 110) as set forth in 
claim 1 in combination with a press assembly (12); the 

press assembly being characterized by
 
   spaced apart vertical press racks (14), each of 

the press racks having top and bottom edges 
(14.1, 14.3), the racks being mounted for 

movement towards and away from each other 
and also being mounted for movement from a 

normal upright position to an inverted 
position so that the top edge may be moved  

 
from the top position to a bottom position, 

and
 
   first mounting means (68) carried by the top edge 

(14.1) of each of the press racks when the 
press racks are in their normal upright 

positions; and
 
   the filter bag assembly further being characterized by
 
   second mounting means (74, 174) secured to the 

top edges of the wide sides (58 - 60, 158 - 
160) of the bags for securing the top edges 

of the bag to the first mounting means 
carried by the top edges of the press racks. 
The filter bag assembly as set forth in claim 7 wherein the 
first mounting means are pins (68) carried by the top edges 

of the press racks, and wherein the second mounting means 
are grommets (74, 174) carried by the top edges of the wide 

sides of the bag. 
The filter bag assembly as set forth in claim 7 further 
characterized by the retaining means being first retaining 

means (72) carried by the bottom edges (14.3) of the press 
racks (14), and second retaining means (78 - 80, 178 - 180) 

connected to the bottom (52, 152) of the bag (50, 150), the 
first and second retaining means engaging each other to 

prevent the bottom of the bag from falling down when the 
press racks are moved from their normal upright position to 

their inverted position. 
The filter bag assembly as set forth in claim 9 wherein the 
first retaining means at the bottom of the racks are pins 

(72), and wherein the second retaining means are straps
