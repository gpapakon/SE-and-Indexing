<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyurethane elastomer 
exhibiting superior flex fatigue properties prepared from a 
mixture of isocyanate-terminated polyether prepolymers and 
alkylthioaromatic amine curative and to a non-pneumatic tire 
fabricated from the elastomer. Urethanes have been used in the manufacture of 
solid tires useful for such applications as industrial 
tires, off-the-road tires, bicycle tires and the like. They 
have not been entirely satisfactory in such applications 
because such urethane solid tires do not have the proper 
cushioning and handling characteristics for a soft vehicle 
ride on such applications as passenger vehicles. Also such 
solid tires suffer from internal heat build-up and 
subsequent degradation of the elastomer material in 
prolonged high speed service conditions or under rough 
terrain situations where the tire is being deformed. As described in U.S. Patent No. 4,934,425 and EP-A-0 334 522, a non-pneumatic 
tire exhibiting improved hysteresis and flex 
fatigue properties is fabricated from a resilient polyether 
urethane elastomeric material formed of a first isocyanate 
end capped low molecular weight polyether polyol having a 
molecular weight of between 200 and 1,500 and a second high 
molecular weight isocyanate end capped polyether polyol 
having a molecular weight between 1,500 and 4,000 cured with 
an aromatic diamine curative, e.g., 4,4'-methylene bis(2-chloroaniline), 
also referred to as MBOCA, which is 
preferred. While the performance of this tire is excellent, 
some concern has been expressed with regard to the use of  
 
MBOCA as the chain extender, or curative, for the 
polyurethane elastomer from which the tire body is 
manufactured. MBOCA is a suspected carcinogen and therefore 
it would be desirable to provide a polyurethane elastomer, 
suitable for manufacturing a non-pneumatic tire, which 
exhibits performance characteristics at least as good as 
those of the polyurethane elastomer of U.S. Patent No. 
4,934,425 but is obtained with a non-carcinogenic curative. EP-A 0 193 872 describes polyurethanes and a process for the 
preparation wherein di(alkylthio)diamine chain extenders are 
used having at least one aromatic ring, one of said at least one 
aromatic ring having thereon at least two alkylthio substituents 
and at least one amino substituent. Using these chain extenders 
for curing an isocyanate prepolymer yields elastomers having 
good physical properties. However, compared to the physical 
properties of a polyurethane obtained with the
