<ABSTRACT>
1. 
A joint structure including an extrudate member and a 

rod-like mating member, in which the extrudate member has 
a closed sectional structure portion and has an end 

thereof joined to the rod-like mating member such that 
the extrudate member intersects a longitudinal direction 

of the rod-like mating member. The extrudate member 
includes a joint portion integrally provided at an end 

thereof and adapted to be matched to the shape of an 
outer surface of the mating member to wrap the mating 

member. The joint portion is bonded to the outer surface 
of the mating member at its longitudinally intermediate 

portion by a brazing, a spot-welding or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure for
joining an extrudate member and a mating member
together, and particularly, to an improvement in a
structure and a method for joining an extrudate member
having a closed sectional structure portion and a
mating rod member while placing an end of the extrudate
member so as to intersect the mating member.In the prior art joining structure of this type, a
butt welding joint or a joint member has been utilized
at a junction between the extrudate member and the
mating member.However, if the butt welding joint is employed, a
preselected joining jig is required and hence, the
handling of the jig is troublesome, resulting in a
degraded joining operability. Further, if the joint
member is employed, the number of parts is
correspondingly increased, and the construction is
complicated.EP-A-0547346 discloses an extruded suspension
component joined to an elongate mating member. This
document discloses a joint structure comprising:
an extrudate member (the suspension component)
having a closed sectional structure portion and an
integral joining region; andan elongated mating member having a longitudinal
axis;the joining region including a joint portion
having a shape conformed to a shape of an outer surface
of said elongated mating member so as to encircle at
least a portion of said mating member, said joint
portion being joined to the outer peripheral surface of
said mating member.In the structure of EP-A-0547346, the longitudinal
axes of the extrudate member and the elongate mating 
member are parallel, the joint portion being created by
the extrusion process by which the extrudate member is
formed. It is not possible to use such a structure if
the longitudinal axes of the extrudate member and the
elongate mating member are to intersect.The joint structure of the preamble of claim 1
is shown in EP-A-0078551.According to one aspect of the present invention,
the closed sectional structure portion of said
extrudate member has a polygonal cross-section and the
joint portion
is formed by an extension of at
least one side of said polygonal-shaped closed
sectional structure portion.In this joint structure, no separate joint member
is used, leading to a simplified construction. In
addition, since the joint portion is joined to the
mating member in a state where the joint portion is
matched to the outer surface of the mating member so as
to encircle the latter, the structure has a high
joining strength.According to another aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a
