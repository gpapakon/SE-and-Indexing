<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to castings, the wearing (wear) surface of which is provided with a network of inserts (6) made from alloy with a high resistance to wear which are each surrounded by a more ductile alloy. The process for manufacturing these castings consists in casting (pouring) the more ductile alloy around the inserts (6) in a mould. In order to hold the inserts in place during casting, they are fastened on a destructible temporary support (4). These castings can be used, in particular, in cylinder crushers and in vertical crushers.
