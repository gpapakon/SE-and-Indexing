<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a method for straightening wire of circular cross-section, which is characterised by the progress of wire through successive circular holes, created either on solid bodies (e.g. plates) (Figures 1a and 1b) or by pairs of cylinders tangential by a straight line parallel to their axes which able to be driven independently, wherein the holes are formed by opening grooves of semicircular cross-section on the surface of the cylinders, in a plane vertical to the cylinders' axes, whilst on the contact line between the two bodies, the circular hole (Figure 2) is formed by the two grooves, wherein the bodies bearing the holes (plates) or the cylinder pairs that form holes at their contact points, execute a circular translational motion (Fig. 1a), on a plane vertical to the direction of the wire advancement, resulting to a cyclic-type bending of the wire at its instantaneous contact point with the circumference of the hole, while the wire advancement is achieved either by an external mechanism in the case of the holes on the plates, or by the coordinated rotation of the cylinder pairs (by an independent mechanism) and the advancement of wire by friction forces on the grooves in the process of the circular translational motion and in the direction of the cylinders' rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 WIRE STRAIGHTENING METHODThe invention refers to a method for straightening wire of circular cross-section, which is characterised by the progress of wire through successive circular holes, created either on solid bodies (e.g. plates) (Figure la, lb) or by pairs of cylinders tangential by a straight line parallel to their axes which are able to be driven independently, wherein the holes are formed by opening grooves of se i- circular cross-section on the surface of the cylinders, in a plane vertical to the cyliners' axes, whilst on the contact line between the two bodies, the circular hole (Figure 2) is formed by the two grooves, wherein the bodies bearing the holes (plates) or the cylinder pairs that form holes at their contact points, execute a circular translational motion (Figure la), on a plane vertical to the direction of the wire advancement, resulting to a cyclic-type bending of the wire at its instantaneous contact point with the circumference of the hole, while the wire advancement is achieved either by an external mechanism in the case of the holes on the plates, or by the coordinated rotation of the cylinder pairs (by an independent mechanism) and the advancement of wire by friction forces on the grooves in the process of the circular translational motion and in the direction of the cylinders' rotation.STATE OF THE ARTThe state of the art contains methods of straightening wire of circular cross-section by passing the wire through straightening rotors. Three methods for the formation of straightening rotors, are stated herebelow:1. The rotor of Figure (3) includes rods (300), one edge of which (301) touches and presses radially the wire to be straightened (303), during the rotation of the rotor, whilst their other edge (302) is secured on the rotor interior. In the course of the rotor's rotation, the wire is successively 

bent by the rod edges (301) and it is finally straightened according to the theory stipulated in paragraph 2 herebelow. 2. In the second method of formation of straightening rotor (Figure 4), the rotor carries interior bushes (406) which rotate along with the rotor body (410) and the wire (405) is forced to pass through those bushes.The geometrical axes of the bushes (407) are parallel to the rotor rotation axis (409), without coinciding with it, and they are located in a distance from the rotor rotation axis, so that during the rotor's rotation the bushes rotate eccentrically in relation to the rotor axis.The wire is forced to pass through said bushes in such a way that

 CLAI MS
1. Method for straightening wire of circular cross-section, which is characterised by the progress of wire through successive circular holes, created either on solid bodies (e.g. plates) (Figure la, lb) or by pairs of cylinders tangential by a straight line parallel to their axes which are able to be driven independently, wherein the holes are formed by opening grooves of semi-circular cross-section on the surface of the cylinders, in a plane vertical to the cyliners' axes, whilst on the contact line between the two bodies, the circular hole (Figure 2) is formed by the two grooves, wherein the bodies bearing the holes (plates) or the cylinder pairs that form holes at their contact points, execute a circular translational motion (Figure la), on a plane vertical to the direction of the wire advancement, resulting to a cyclic-type bending of the wire at its instantaneous contact point with the circumference of the hole, while the wire advancement is achieved either by an external mechanism in the case of the holes on the plates, or by the coordinated rotation of the cylinder pairs (by an independent mechanism) and the advancement of wire by friction forces on the grooves in the process of the circular translational motion and in the direction of the cylinders' rotation.
2. Method, as in Claim 1, wherein more than one bending rings of various internal diameters are secured on each plate moving on a circle and remaining parallel.to itself, for the straightening of more than one wires of different diameters simultaneously.
3. Wire straightening method, as in Claim 1, wherein the translational and at the same time circular motion of the plate, where the bending rings are secured on, is achieved by joining it to two camshafts, which have parallel planes of maximum eccentricity and rotate in phase (Figure 15). 


4. Wire straightening method, as in Claτlm 1, wherein the bending plates are joined on the camshafts, as in Claτlm 3, wherein for the adjustment of the eccentricity, the use of cams of rectangular cross-section and two adjustment screws are preferred where the eccentricity is in relation to the rotation axis, which is of rectangual cross-section, having one side equal to the smaller side of the rectangular cross- section of the cam (Figure 18).
5. Wire straightening method, as in Claim 1, wherein the successive cylinder pairs bearing semi-circular cross- section grooves for the formation of holes on the meeting points of the grooves, participate in the main translational circular motion, and they are simultaneously rotated through an independent mechanism, thus advancing the wire by means of friction forces on the points of contact with the grooves.
