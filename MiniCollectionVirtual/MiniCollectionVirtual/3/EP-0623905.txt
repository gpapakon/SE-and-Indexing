<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an infrared motion detector having an arcuate lens screen (13) which is assembled in front of an infrared sensor (10) and whose lenses (14) in each case cover a monitoring area and focus the radiation of an infrared radiation source, located within the monitoring area, on the infrared sensor (10), the lenses (14) which are located in the central area "X" of the lens screen (13) casting the incident radiation in the direct beam path to the infrared sensor (10), while at least one reflector is provided for detecting laterally incident marginal beams. To avoid gaps in the detection range which are caused by beams which impinge on the rear of the reflector, and furthermore in order to increase the number of monitoring areas so as, for example, also to detect radiation sources which are already located behind the sensor (10), there is arranged in the beam path in front of the sensor (10) a beam splitter which has at least one obliquely placed plane-parallel beam-splitter element (16) whose degree of transmission (transmittance) "T" is greater than or equal to the degree of reflection (reflectance) "R" and to the transmission radiation from the central area "X" of the lens screen impinges in the direct beam path on the sensor (10) and the reflection radiation from the area "Y" of the laterally incident marginal radiation is deflected onto the sensor (10).
