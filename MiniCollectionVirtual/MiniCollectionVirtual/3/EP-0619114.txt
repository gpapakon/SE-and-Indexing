<ABSTRACT>
Granular bleaching composition, which may be used in particular for bleaching the hair, in which the granules have been obtained by granulation of a mixture of the various pulverulent constituents thereof using two binders: a first binder chosen from the group formed by the homo- and the copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof, and a second binder chosen from the group formed by polyalkylene glycols, the alkylene group of which is a C2-C4 group, and which have a molecular weight of between 200 and 30,000, and the mixtures thereof, the granules having a particle size of between 65  mu m and 800  mu m.

Granulated bleaching composition which may 
especially be used for bleaching hair, in which the 

granules have been obtained by granulation of a mixture 
of its various pulverulent constituents by means of a 

granulation agent, characterized in that the granulation 
agent comprises two binders: a first binder chosen from 

the group formed by polyvinyl alcohol, homo- and 
copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and their mixtures and a 

second binder chosen from the group formed by polyalkylene 
glycols in which the alkylene group is C
2
 to C
4
 
and which have a molecular weight between 200 and 30,000 

and their mixtures, the granules having a particle size 
between 65 µm and 800 µm. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the first binder is a polyvinyl alcohol. 
Composition according to either of Claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the second binder is a 

polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight between 
200 and 8000. 
Composition according to either of Claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the second binder is a 

polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight between 200 
and 4000 and preferably between 200 and 600. 
Composition according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the concentration of each of the binders 

is between 2 and 20%. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the first binder is present in a 

concentration between 2 and 8%. 
Composition according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it contains at least one lubricating 

agent taken from the group formed by cellulose 
derivatives and stearates. 
Composition according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the lubricating agent contains at least one 

cellulose derivative chosen from the group formed by 
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethyl 

cellulose.  
 
Composition according to either of Claims 7 and 
8, characterized in that the quantity of cellulose 

derivative(s) present as lubricating agent represents 
from 1 to 10% by weight of the total weight of the 

composition. 
Composition according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the lubricating agent is chosen from the group 

formed by alkali metal stearates, alkaline-earth metal 
stearates and polyol stearates. 
Composition according to either of Claims 7 and 
10, characterized in that the quantity of stearate(s) 

present as lubricating agent is between 0.1 and 5% by 
weight relative to the total weight of the composition. 
Process for the preparation of the composition 
according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterized in that 

the first binder is added to the various pulverulent 
constituents of the mixture to be granulated, the mixture 

is homogenized, the second binder dissolved in a solvent 
is sprayed onto a moving bed of the previously obtained 

mixture and the solvent is removed. 
Process according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the solvent for the second binder is chosen from the 

group formed by C
1
-C
4

ethylene chloride and their mixtures. 
Process according to either of Claims 12 and 13, 
intended for the preparation of a composition according 

to Claim 7, characterized in that the lubricating 
agent(s) is (are) added to the pulverulent constituents 

of the mixture to be granulated. 
Process according to one of Claims 12 to 14, 
characterized in that the moving bed for the mixture to 

be granulated is obtained in a tank with the aid of (a) 
stirrer(s) or in a rotating drum. 
Process according to one of Claims 12 to 14, 
characterized in that the moving bed for the mixture to 

be granulated is obtained by fluidization in a stream of 

ascending gas. 
Process according to one of Claims 12 to 16, 
characterized in that the solvent is removed thermally  

 
and/or under reduced pressure.
