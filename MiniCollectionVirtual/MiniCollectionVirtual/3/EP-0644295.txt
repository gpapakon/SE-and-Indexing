<ABSTRACT>
Drill for drilling rails and track rigs, in railroad 
applications, including a body (3) which supports a motor 

(6) driving a drilling tool (11) through a reduction unit 
(12). Elements (20-25) are provided for the translatory 

motion of the drilling tool with respect to the body. There 
are also elements (50,52,53) for removably fixing the body 

with respect to the element (51) to be drilled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drill for drilling 
rails and track rigs for railroad applications. It is known that drilling devices adapted specifically 
for use on track rails are currently commercially available. Such devices, which have particular constructive 
characteristics, have rather considerable dimensions and 
weights which often cause great difficulties in use. Such devices generally have an electric motor or an 
internal-combustion engine which is mounted coaxially with 
the drill or milling cutter and which advances rigidly with 
the drill. This type of structure, with the motor mounted so that 
it is axially aligned with the drilling tool and lies along 
its extension, entails a considerable longitudinal dimension 
which often is not compatible with the space available in 
some points of the track, such as rail switches and the 
like. To the aforesaid it should be added the fact that in 
versions with an internal-combustion engine the exhaust of 
the combustion gases of the engine is often directed towards 
the operator, who consequently finds himself working in a 
toxic environment. Such devices, as previously mentioned, are generally 
very heavy, and therefore movement is difficult; 
furthermore, in most cases they cannot be used by a single 
operator. Conventional devices are generally predisposed only to 
execute holes horizontally, i.e. a hole whose axis is  
 
perpendicular to the stem of the rail, whereas in railroad 
applications it is often necessary to execute holes 
vertically, for example in the slabs supporting the boxes 
for the electrical actuation of rail switches; in this case 
it is necessary to use different devices, as it is not 
possible to modify the conventional drill adapted only to 
make horizontal holes. A drill having the features set forth in the preamble 
of claim 1 is known from the prior document US-A-1 671 575. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
eliminate the above mentioned drawbacks by providing a drill 
for drilling rails and track rigs for railroad applications 
which is structured so as to allow to work both horizontally 
and vertically and in all the positions occurring in the 
field of railroads. Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, a 
particular object of the invention is to provide a drill 
which is very compact and handy and can consequently be used 
even in narrow spaces, such as are typically available at 
rail switches. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
drill which has a considerably reduced

Drill (1;2) for drilling rails and track rigs, in 
railroad applications, comprising: a body (3) which supports 

a motor (6;8) that drives a drilling tool (11) through a 
reduction unit (12), the output shaft (10) of said motor 

being substantially parallel to and spaced from the axis of 
said tool (11); means (20-26) for the translatory motion of 

said drilling tool with respect to said body; and means 
(50;60;70) for removably fixing said body with respect to 

an element (51;72) to be drilled, 
characterized in that
 
said body (3) is substantially L-shaped, with a first wing 

(4) that forms a flange (5;7) for coupling to said motor, 
and a second wing (9) for accommodating said tool, the 

second wing (9) being substantially perpendicular to said 
first wing, and said motor being coupled at said flange (5; 

7) in a position located above said second wing (9) with 
said output shaft (10) being superimposed on the axis of 

said tool (11) so that the drill assembly assumes a 
substantially U-shaped configuration. 
Claim according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said body (3) is made of aluminium alloys. 
Drill according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that in a version driven by an 

internal-combustion engine (8) said output shaft (10) is 
connected to said reduction unit (12) by means of an elastic 

coupling (15) and said engine is connected to said body by 
means of the interposition of vibration-damping bushes (16). 
Drill according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said means for removably 

fixing said body with respect to the element to be drilled  
 

are constituted by interchangeable jigs (50;60;70) which can 
be removably coupled to the free end of said second wing of 

said body. 
Drill according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said jigs comprise a jig (50) for engaging a rail web (51), 

a jig (60) for locking to a rail flange and a jig (70) for 
fixing to profiles (72) located at slabs supporting boxes 

for electric actuation of rail switches. 
Drill according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said translatory motion means 

comprise a sleeve (20) which is internally grooved, 
kinematically connected to said reduction unit (12), and 

slidingly coupleable to a hollow grooved shaft (21) which 
forms the supporting spindle for said tool (11). 
Drill according to claim 6, characterized in that 
it comprises a slider (22) which is slidingly coupled to 

said body and rotatably supports said grooved shaft (21), 
said slider having, on its surface, a rack-like segment (24) 

with which a gear meshes (25), said gear being connected to 
an actuation lever (26). 
Drill according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises a fixed abutment 

rod (40) which is supported by said body and extends inside 
said grooved shaft, the free end of said fixed abutment rod 

acting as a device for expelling the drilling scrap 
following the return of said slider to its initial position. 
Drill according to claim 8, characterized in that 
said rod (40) has said free end thereof in proximity of a 

ball (30) which controls a refrigeration system connected to 
a cooling channel of the drilling tool (11).  

 
Drill according to claim 7, 
characterized in that it comprises means (80) for 

the initial positioning of said actuation lever. 
Drill according to claim 10, characterized in that 
said initial positioning means comprise a cap (81) which is 

fixed to the end of said actuation lever (26) and is 
rotatably coupleable around a tang (82) which is axially 

aligned with, and rigidly coupled to, the driving shaft (83) 
of said gear (25) which meshes with said slider (22), a 

polygonal bar segment (85) being furthermore provided which 
is accommodated in a polygonal seat (86) formed by said tang 

and is removably engageable in a polygonal cavity (87)

said cap to said tang, a stem (89) being connected to said 
bar, said stem ending with a button (90) that protrudes from 

said cap, said polygonal bar segment being removably 
disengageable from said polygonal cavity for the initial 

positioning of said actuation lever.
