<ABSTRACT>
In a rolling and cutting method for an endless 
hot-rolled steel strip comprising continuous hot 

rolling and joining rough-rolled slabs to each other 
with a joint having a boundary between slabs, 

subjecting the joined rough-rolled strip continuously 
to hot finish rolling to obtain an endless hot-rolled 

steel strip with a joint having a boundary between 
strips, cutting the endless hot-rolled steel strip 

immediately before coiling, and coiling each cut strip 

into a coil, the endless hot-rolled steel strip being 
cut such that the boundary between two successive 

slabs or sheets is positioned on the radially 
outermost face of the coil; the target cut point is 

set relative to the boundary by applying the tracking 
error of the boundary and the cutting control error 

for ensuring that the target cut point is accurately 
positioned on the radially outermost surface of the 

coil; the strip is kept from breaking at the boundary 
when coiled, and the coil as a final product can be 

produced with minimum scrap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
rolling and cutting an "endless" hot-rolled steel
strip. The term "endless" is intended to mean
especially a composite strip having successive lengths
laid end-to-end with a boundary connecting them
together.Continuous or "endless" hot rolling has been
proposed in which steels such as slabs, same or
different in size and/or kind, are joined to each
other on a hot strip mill line during or after rough
rolling, wherein the resulting strip is subjected to
continuous finish rolling, and wherein the finished
strip is cut into desired or required lengths in
accordance with customer orders, followed by coiling
into separate coils, one coil for each different size
or kind.A typical layout of an endless hot rolling mill
is shown at the top portion of Fig. 1. Successive
slabs roughly rolled by a rough rolling mill 1, after
passing a shear 3, are moved along in line and joined 
to each other by a rough-rolled slab joining apparatus
2. The joined strip of successive slabs which differ
from each other is rolled continuously to a
predetermined thickness by a finish rolling mill 4,
cooled by a hot-rolled steel strip cooling apparatus
6, and then cut by a strip shear 7 into individual
product coils. Each length of cut strip is passed
through coiler pinch rolls 8 and wound up by a coiler
9 having a mandrel 9'.Steps of such "endless" hot rolling are
diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2. Slabs produced
according to kind and size of steel are joined to each
other through the steps of heating and rough rolling,
followed by continuous hot rolling in an "endless"
manner with each predecessor slab or strip joined to
and followed by its successor. During the steps from
joining to cutting as shown in Fig. 2, the joined
strip is endlessly rolled under conditions where
intermediate products of same or
different kinds of steel in different sizes are
interconnected. After cutting, the strip is divided
into products according to kind and size of steel, and
then the divided strips are wound into separate coils.In the steps of cutting the endless hot-rolled
steel strip after finish rolling and coiling, it is
required to cut sheets that are different as to kind 
and size of steel, including thickness and width, at
their boundaries, but with minimum waste or yield
reduction, and to finish the products as different
coils each comprising a single kind of steel in a
single size.To meet these requirements the mill is usually
designed to cut the strip by use of a strip shear,
attempting to take

<CLAIMS>
A method for rolling and cutting a continuous
hot-rolled steel strip, comprising:


joining rough-rolled slabs (12,13) to each other
to form a joined rough-rolled strip having a boundary

(15) between said joined slabs (12,13),
subjecting said joined rough-rolled strip
continuously to hot finish rolling to produce an

endless hot-rolled steel strip having a boundary (15)
between said joined slabs (12,13), and
cutting said endless hot-rolled steel strip and
coiling said cut strip, characterised in that
said endless hot-rolled steel strip is cut at a
predetermined location located adjacent to and upstream

of said boundary whereby said boundary (15) between
successive strips is positioned on the radially

outermost coil face when said cut strip is rolled into
a coil.
A method according to claim 1, including the
step of determining a target cut point on said strip

dependent upon tracking error of said boundary (15),
and upon known error caused in cutting control.
A method according to claim 1 further
comprising:


generating a positional notation in a tracking
apparatus (A) of said boundary (15) corresponding to

the location between said slabs,
moving said boundary (15) to a first finish stand
in a finish rolling mill (4) via a slab speed detector

(2a), and
causing said tracking apparatus (A) to generate a
target cut point, being said predetermined position,

downstream of said finish rolls, based on detected
strip thicknesses in said finish rolling mill (4) and

speeds of said rolls, all at the time said boundary
(15) passes said finish rolls.
A method according to claim 3, wherein said
boundary position is generated in said tracking

apparatus by causing a position sensor to detect said
position of said boundary upstream of said finish

rolls.
A method according to claim 3, in which said
boundary position is generated in said tracking

apparatus when said rough-rolled slabs are joined
together.
A method according to any of claims 3 to 5
wherein said target cut point is compensated by an

allowance that is about three times the value of a
standard deviation of cut position error due to cut

position error arising in said tracking apparatus and
cut position error caused by strip shear.
A method according to any preceding claim, in
which said rough rolled slabs are of different kinds or

sizes whereby said joined rough rolled strip is a
composite hot strip.
