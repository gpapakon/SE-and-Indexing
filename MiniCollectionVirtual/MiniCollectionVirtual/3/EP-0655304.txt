<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a skin-integrated laminate and mold device comprising a male mold (2) and a female 
mold (1) provided above and opposite to said male mold in such a manner that they freely move toward and away 

from each other, and used for forming a skin-integrated laminate, said method being characterized in that an end 
opening (10) is formed at a circumferential edge of a cavity when said female and male mold (1, 2) are clamped, that 

a plate mold (4) is provided which has a wood end face forming tip portion (5) that can enter said end opening (10), 
and that the ends of a skin material interposed between said male and female molds (2, 1) are clamped by means of a 

clamping mechanism (3) that can be freely opened and/or closed, whereby said skin material is integrally laminated 
over an area from one side of a core material of synthetic resin to the wood end face thereof at the same time that 

said core material is formed, and the skin material is prevented from shrinking thereafter so as to provide a good 
appearance, thus making it possible to efficiently produce a skin-integrated laminate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for 
producing a skin-integrated laminate in which a skin is 
accurately integratedly adhered in layer to a molded 
synthetic resin substrate from its one side to the 
other end surface and to a mold assembly for use therein. A skin-integrated laminate in which a skin 
material is adhered integratedly in layer to one side 
of a molded synthetic resin substrate is widely used 
for interior automotive trims, for example, automotive 
door trim and the like. Recently, however, there is a 
tendency that the diversification of designs and the 
like is accompanied by needs of molded synthetic resin 
substrate having such a complicated shape that turnup 
is present around the molded substrates. In such articles, 
a skin material is required to be accurately adhered 
integrately in layer to the molded synthetic 
resin substrate from its one side to its edge, namely 
end surface. However, a method has heretofore been 
adopted by which a divided mold which slides horizontally  
 
to the end surface is used to force a skin material 
to the end surface to thereby wrap the end surface 
in the skin material as disclosed in, for example, EP-A-186016 
which corresponds to Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 61-137,714, 
which shows the features of the preambles of claims 1 and 2. However, in a method as mentioned above, the 
skin material in the state that its end is clamped by a 
cramping mechanism is forcibly extended and integrated 
with the end surface of the molded synthetic resin 
substrate, and therefore, there has been such a problem 
that the residual stress of the skin material after the 
molding and the thermal shrinkage accompanying the heat 
resistance test cause the skin material to shrink, 
whereby such a phenomenon that the molded synthetic 
resin substrate layer inside the skin material exposes 
is caused to make the appearance bad. Also, there has 
been such a problem that since the special divided mold 
must be used, the molding process is complicated and 
the apparatus per se is also complicated. This invention has been completed for the 
purpose of solving the prior art problems mentioned 
above and providing a process for producing a skin-integrated 
laminate exhibiting a high quality by which 
simultaneously with the forming of a molded synthetic 
resin substrate, the molded substrate is firmly wrapped 
in a skin material to its end surface and the skin 
material is adhered integratedly in layer to the molded  
 
substrate, whereby a high quality

A process for producing a skin-integrated laminate comprising setting a skin 
material (21) whose peripheral end is clamped with a clamping mechanism (3) 

between a female and a male mold (1,2), simultaneously therewith feeding a 
molten resin material for molding a substrate (22) with which the skin material (21) 

is to be integrated between the skin material (21) and the male mold (2), clamping 
the molds (1,2) to form a skin-integrated laminate in which the skin material (21) is 

integrated with the surface of a molded synthetic resin substrate (22),
 
characterized in that 


the male and female molds (1,2) are clamped whereby the peripheral end of the 
cavity formed between the male and female molds is open as an end opening 

(10), 
an end forming pointed end part (5) of a plate mold (4) is moved between the 
clamped male and female molds (1,2), thereby closing the end opening (10), 
the clamping of the skin material (21) with the clamping mechanism (3) is 
loosened when the molten resin material is fed, thereby allowing a part of the skin 

material (21) to reach the part of the end-forming pointed end part (5) facing the 
end opening (10) of the cavity by the extension of the molten resin material, 
whereby the skin material (21) adheres integratedly to the surface of the substrate 
(22) facing the female mold (1) and the end part of the substrate. 
A mold assembly comprising a male mold (2) having an outer peripheral surface, a 
female mold (1) comprising a cavity (11) having an internal peripheral end which is 

spaced from the outer peripheral surface of the male mould when the moulds are 
clamped thereby forming an end opening, the female mold being freely movable 

close to and away from said male mold,
 
characterized by
 
a plate mold (4) having an end surface-forming pointed end part (5) which can 

enter the end opening (10), said plate mold being mounted on the peripheral 
portion of the lower end of the above-mentioned female mold (1) being freely  

 
turnable towards and away from said end opening, and a clamping mechanism (3) 

which is provided on the periphery of the lower portion of the above-mentioned 
male mold (2) so as to be freely opened and closed and which can clamp the end 

of a skin material which can be located between said male mold (2) and said 
female mold (1).
