A method for the automatic quality control and/or classification 
of plants, in which an electronic color camera (20) 

is employed to produce an image of a plant (12) illuminated 
by a first associated source (22) of illumination in a first 

image taking direction, the electrical image signals of the 
taken color image supplied by the color camera (20) are digitized 

pixelwise and the digitized image signals are evaluated 
by a color image computer (26), characterized in that 

an image of the plant, which is illuminated by a second associated 
source (32) of illumination, is taken by an electronic 

half-tone camera (30) in a second image taking direction, 
which is different from the first image taking direction, 

the electrical image signals supplied by the half-tone 
camera (30) are digitized and the digitized image signals of 

the half-tone image taken are evaluated by a half-tone image 
computer (36) in order to determine features of the plant 

(12) which are not available from the color image taken in 
the first image taking direction, and in that the source 

(22, 32) of illumination necessary for each image taking 
direction does not interfere with image taking in the other 

direction because either each camera (20, 30) is insensitive 
to the light from the source (32 or 22, respectively) of 

illumination associated with the other camera (30 or 20, 
respectively) or because the two sources (22, 32) of illumination 

are switched on alternatingly, each camera (20, 30) 
triggering the taking of an image when the source (22, 32) 

of illumination associated with the camera is switched on.  
 
The method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the color camera (20) takes an image of the plant (12) from 

above and the half-tone camera (30) one of the plant (12) 
from the side. 
The method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
the digitized image signals from the half-tone camera (30) 

are evaluated in order to determine the height of the plant 
(12). 
The method as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the he
ight of the plant (12), starting at the upper margin 
of the image, is determined on the basis of the first significant 

contrast discontinuity between the image of the 
plant (12) and the image of the background. 
The method as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, characterized 
in that in the case of a pot plant (12) the height of 

the plant pot (14) is determined on the basis of the contrast 
discontinuity between the image of the upper margin of 

the pot and the image of the background. 
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that criteria for assessment of quality of 

the plant (12) are determined by linking features which are 
obtained from the color image taken by the color camera (20), 

with features which are obtained from the half-tone image 
produced by the half-tone camera (30). 
The method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the projection area of the crown of the plant from above is 

determined from the color image taken by means of the color 
camera (20) and the projection area of the plant crown from 

the side is determined from the half-tone image taken by 
means of the half-tone camera (30), and that an approximation 

is formed for the volume of the plant crown on the basis 
of the weighted product of the two projection areas.  

 
The method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that an arrangement of color references is so 

located in the field of view of the color camera (20) that 
it is photographed each time a color image is taken, in that 

the correct color vectors corresponding to the color references 
are stored in the color computer, in that the color 

vectors of the image parts, corresponding to the color references, 
of a color image taken are compared with the stored 

color vectors in order to determine departures from the 
stored color vectors, and in that the color vectors of the 

color image taken are corrected in the sense of removing the 
departures. 
The method as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that an arrangement of half-tone references 

is so located in the field of view of the half-tone camera 
(30) that it is photographed each time a half-tone image is 

taken, in that the correct gray scale values corresponding 
to the half-tone references are stored in the half-tone computer, 

in that the gray scale values of the image parts corresponding 
to the half-tone references are compared with the 

stored gray scale values in order to determine departures 
from the stored gray scale values, and in that the gray 

scale values of the half-tone image taken are corrected in 
the sense of removing the departures. 
An arrangement for the automatic optical quality control 
and/or classification of plants, comprising an electronic 

color camera (20) which is so arranged that it can take a 
color image of a plant (12) in a first image taken direction, 

a first source (22) of illumination associated with 
the color camera (20) and a color image computer (26) for 

the evaluation of the electrical image signals supplied by 
the color camera (20), characterized by an electronic half-tone 

camera (30) which is so arranged that it can take a 
half-tone image of the same plant (12) in a second image 

taking direction different from the first image taking direction, 
a second source (32) of illumination associated

for the evaluation of the electrical image signals supplied 
by the half-tone camera (30) for the determination of features 

of the plant which are not available from the color 
image taken in the first image taking direction, wherein the 

source (22, 32) of illumination necessary for each image 
taking direction does not interfere with image taking in the 

other direction due to the fact that either each camera is 
insensitive to the light of the source (32 or 22, respectively) 

of illumination associated with the other camera or 
a control device (40) alternatingly switches on the two 

sources (22, 32) of illumination and causes each camera (20, 
30) to take an image of the plant in a time interval in 

which only the source (22, 32) of illumination associated 
with the camera (20, 30) is switched on. 
The arrangement as claimed in claim 10, characterized in 
that the first source (22) of illumination is a white light 

source, in that the second source (32) of illumination is a 
narrow-band light source whose spectrum is outside the range 

of sensitivity of the color camera (20), and in that the 
half-tone camera (30) is so designed that it is solely sensitive 

in the narrow spectral range of the second source 
(32) of illumination.

that the narrow-band spectrum of the second source (32) of 

illumination is in the near infrared range.

lines during a relative movement between the plant (12) and 
the camera (20, 30). 
The arrangement as claimed in claim 15, characterized in 
that the camera (20,30) is stationary and the plant (12) is 

continuously moved past the camera (20, 30) while the image 
is taken. 
The arrangement as claimed in claim 15, characterized in 
that the plant (12) is stationary while the image is taken 

and the camera (20, 30) is continuously moved past the plant 
(12) while the image is taken. 
The arrangement as claimed in any one of the claims 10 
to 17, characterized in that the second source (32) of illumination 

associated with the half-tone camera (30) illuminates 
the plant from the side opposite to the half-tone camera 

(30) so that the half-tone camera (30) takes a transmitted 
light image of the plant (12).

associated with the half-tone camera (30) illuminates
