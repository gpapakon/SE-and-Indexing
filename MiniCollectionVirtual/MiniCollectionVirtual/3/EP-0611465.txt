<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to selective call receivers.
A prior art pager of this kind is known from US-A-5 025 252.Normally, a selective call receiver (e.g., a pager), upon receiving a
message, stores the message in memory for review at a later time.
Received messages are typically stored into message storage slots in
memory organized sequentially in chronological order. For example,
messages may be stored by their relative arrival sequence, such as in a first-in-first-out
sequence where the oldest message is presented first to a user.
Alternatively, the messages may be presented in a last-in-first-out
sequence (i.e., in reverse chronological order), where the newest message
is presented first to the user. A selective call receiver would present a
sequence of received messages to the user in one of these ways, which the
user must understand and logically follow.Clearly, the number of message storage slots are limited by the
available memory. For example, a selective call receiver may be capable of
storing up to five messages before running out of memory. Thus, when
the message storage slots are full (i.e., five messages are stored), new
messages may be stored at the expense of deleting older messages. One
such method currently used is to delete the oldest message to
accommodate a newly received message. Unfortunately, if a user wishes
to review an older message, it may have been automatically deleted.Current integrated circuit technologies have increased memory
capacity. As a result, selective call receivers can store more messages. This
significantly reduces the need for automatically deleting messages.
However, users tend to find it more difficult to retrieve or locate a desired 
message for the following reasons. First, the sheer number of stored
messages increases beyond a manageable level. This makes it more
difficult for users to keep track of stored messages. Second, users tend to
randomly read and delete messages, and a newly received message is
usually placed in the first available message storage slot. Hence, selective
call receiver users may not be able to easily determine the time priority of
the received messages or where the latest received message was stored.For example, FIGs. 1A, 1B, and 1C show a display 100 for presenting
messages to a user of a selective call receiver. This display 100 is
representative of a display used in the Motorola PMR 2000 alphanumeric
display message pager manufactured by Motorola, Inc. of Schaumburg,
Illinois. In that pager, up to sixteen messages can

<CLAIMS>
A selective call receiver, comprising:

a receiver (203) for selectively receiving messages;
a memory (206) coupled to the receiver for storing the messages;
means (230) coupled to the memory and to the receiver for assigning a
chronological order to each of the messages stored in the memory based

on an order in which the messages are received, and also for assigning a
status designation, other than the chronological order, to the messages;
means (230) coupled to the memory for prioritizing the messages in a
sequential order being prioritized first by a priority of the status

designation assigned to the messages and then further prioritized
therewithin according to the chronological order assigned to the messages;

and
means (208) coupled to the memory for displaying message indicators to
a user to represent the messages stored in the memory, the displayed

message indicators capable of being organized by said means
for prioritizing the messages to represent a sequential

order for the messages, the sequential order being prioritized first by a
priority of the status designation assigned to the messages and then

further prioritized therewithin according to the chronological order
assigned to the messages.
The selective call receiver of claim 1, wherein the status designation
assigned to each of the messages is at least one of a set of status categories

including "read message", "unread message", "protected message", "page
type", "timed activation event", "duplicated message", "sequential-lockout

message", and "message contains errors".
The selective call receiver of claim 1, further comprising:

   user input control means for accepting user input, and wherein
the displaying means is responsive to the user input for displaying the

messages to a user of the selective call receiver according to the sequential
order for the messages represented by the message indicators.
The selective call receiver of claim 1, wherein the assigning means is
responsive to the receiver for assigning status designation and

chronological order to the messages in response to receiving the messages. 
The selective call receiver of claim 1, further comprising a message re-sequencer
coupled to the assigning means and the memory for re-sequencing

the status designation and the chronological order assigned to
the messages stored in the memory according to the sequential order for

prioritizing the messages first by the status designation and then further
prioritizing therewithin according to the chronological order assigned to

the messages, the displaying means displaying the message indicators to
the user to represent the messages according to the sequential order

assigned thereto by the message re-sequencer.
The selective call receiver of claim 5, further comprising user input
control means coupled to the message re-sequencer for invoking the

message re-sequencer in response to a user input, the displaying means
displaying the message indicators to the user to represent the messages

according to the sequential order assigned thereto by the message re-sequencer.
The selective call receiver of claim 5, wherein the message re-sequencer
is responsive to the receiver for re-sequencing the status designation and

the chronological order of the stored messages in response to a message
being received, the displaying means displaying the message indicators to

the user to represent the messages according to the sequential order
assigned thereto by the message re-sequencer.
The selective call receiver of claim 5, wherein the message re-sequencer
is invoked in response to the selective call receiver being turned off.
