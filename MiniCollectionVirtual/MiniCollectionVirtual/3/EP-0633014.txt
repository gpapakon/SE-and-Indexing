<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 
10
 for holding a solid compact 
medicament has relatively displaceable, substantially 

planar first and second members 
12
,
14
 having opposed 
edge portions 
16
,
18
. Each edge portion 
16
,
18
 has at 
least one notch 
20
 having an interior wall 
22
. Housing 

21
 is provided for holding members 
12
,
14
 in a 
substantially co-planar relationship. When members 


12
,
14
 are displaced, preferably along a fixed axis, to 
a first position, the interior walls 
22
 of the opposed, 
aligned notches 
20
 define an open gripping jaw 
24
 for 
receiving and subsequently releasing the caplet 
(A)
. 
Further, when members 
12
,
14
 are displaced to a second 
position, the open gripping jaw 
24
 then partially 
closes, thereby capturing the caplet 
(A)
 securely 
within the notches 
20
 in the gripping jaw 
24
 for 
processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for
holding a solid compact medicament during processing.
More particularly, the invention concerns a solid
compact medicament holding apparatus in which
overlapping portions of the medicament, such as a
caplet, are exposed to a coating process to produce a
coated solid compact medicament which resembles a
conventional capsule.In the marketing of solid compact
medicaments, there is a clear consumer preference for a
shiny, capsule-like, single or multiple color solid
dosage form that is easy to swallow. Generally,
gelatinous coatings have been used to achieve a shiny
surface on a solid dosage form, also referred to herein
as a caplet, pill, tablet, and the like. Caplets are
solid, substantially cylindrical shaped medicaments;
pills are solid, substantially round shaped
medicaments; and, tablets are solid, substantially
spherical shaped medicaments (see for reference Seitz
et al., "Tablet Coating," Chapter 12, Page 346, The
Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy). One
method of making caplets which has been used to meet
the needs of the pharmaceutical consumer is described
and illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,965,089 to Sauter
et al, and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,990,358 and 4,921,108,
both to Berta et al. In particular, Sauter '089 and
Berta '358 each teaches a method and apparatus for
holding and dipping one end portion of a caplet into a 
gelatin pool and then positioning the caplet so as to
dip the uncoated end portion of the caplet into a
second gelatin pool of a different color. However, a
major drawback of the apparatus and methods taught in
these patents is that a constant force spring is relied
upon to hold the caplet during the dip coating process
and also during caplet transfer to other processing
steps, such as drying and packaging. As can be readily
appreciated, such a constant spring force could impart
a shear force which would be unacceptably large on some
abrasion sensitive material included in solid compact
medicaments. Acetyl salicylic acid, also known as
aspirin, and gelatinous coatings which have not been
completely cured, are two examples of abrasion
sensitive materials which could be damaged by such
shear force.Furthermore, since existing caplet holders
generally rely upon a constant force spring for holding
the caplet, they require some sort of mechanical force
to load the caplet into and discharge the caplet from
the holder, thereby potentially compromising the
integrity of the caplet material. For instance, Sauter
'089 and Berta '108, each

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for holding a solid compact medicament (A) during processing,
characterised by:


first (12) and second (14) substantially parallel, planar members, said
members having opposed edge portions (16, 18) each edge portion having at least

one notch (20) extending the whole thickness thereof and opposed to and aligned with a
corresponding notch (20) in the other edge, said

notches (20) each having an interior wall (22); said members (12, 14) being relatively
displaceable between a first position wherein said interior walls (22) of said opposed

notches (20) define an open gripping jaw (24) for receiving and subsequently
releasing said solid compact medicament (A), and a second position wherein said

open gripping jaw (24) at least partially closes, to capture a circumferential portion of
said solid compact medicament (a) to be coated; and, means for holding said

members (12, 14) with said gripping jaw (24) open or at least partially closed.
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 wherein said first (12) and second (14)
members are displaceable along a fixed axis.
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 wherein a housing (21) is provided for
holding said 
first (12) and second (14) members in a substantially parallel and planar
relationship.
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 further including means, cooperating with
said gripping jaw (24), for precisely positioning a predetermined portion of the caplet

(A) for processing. 
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 4 wherein said positioning means is a stop
plate (26) spaced a predetermined distance from said gripping jaw (24).
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 4 wherein said stop plate (26)
is adjustable relative to said gripping jaw (24).
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 4 wherein said stop plate (26) is provided
with a depression (17) aligned with the longitudinal axis of the gripping jaw (24), said

depression (17) being sized to accommodate an end portion of the solid compact
medicament (A).
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 further comprising means cooperating
with said first (12) and second (14) members for initiating disengagement of the solid

compact medicament (A) from said gripping jaw (24), said initiating means comprising
a bar-like member (32) or air pressure.
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 wherein said interior wall (22) of at least
one of said notches (20) is provided with means for compliantly engaging the compact

medicament (A), said compliant means (27) being a rubber-like material.
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 further including means, cooperating with
said members (12, 14) for movably displacing said members (12, 14) from said first to

said second position.
