<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
polymerization of olefins and more particularly to a
polymerization process whereby elastomeric ethylene-alpha-olefin
and elastomeric ethylene-alpha olefin-nonconjugated
diolefin polymers are produced with a
reduction in fouling of the reaction vessel.Various processes and catalysts exist for the
copolymerization of ethylene and alpha-olefins. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 3,113,115 discloses that a
plastomeric copolymer of ethylene and propylene may be
prepared using a catalyst system comprising diethyl
aluminum chloride and titanium tetrachloride while U.S.
Patent No. 3,300,459 discloses that an elastomeric
copolymer of ethylene and propylene containing from 20
to about 70 weight percent ethylene can be prepared
using a catalyst system comprising trihexyl aluminum and
vanadium oxychloride. From this technological base,
processes for the production of the commercially
important elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymers,
commonly referred to as EP elastomers, and the
elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and a
nonconjugated diolefin, generally referred to as EPDM
elastomers have been developed.
Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene including:
(a) 60 - 90 % in moles of ethylene;(b) 1 - 30 % in moles of an α-olefn CH2=CHR, where R is an alkyl radical having
from 2 to 6 carbon atoms;(c) 0 - 20 % in moles of propylene;
the sum of percentages (a), (b) and (c) being equal to 100, and the crude product
having an ultimate tensile stress of between 10 and 200 kg/cm2 are known from
EP-A-0 546 629.U.S. Patent No. 3,166,517 discloses that a catalyst
system prepared by reacting, in the presence of carbon
tetrachloride or trichloromonofluoromethane, (a)
aluminum triisobutyl, diisobutylaluminum chloride or
isobutyl aluminum dichloride and the reaction product of
0.5 to 2 moles of aluminum chloride with 1 mol of
aluminum triisobutyl, with (b) vanadium
tris(acetylacetonate); the proportions of (a) and (b) 
being selected so that the value of the molar ratio of
isobutyl radicals to vanadium atoms is at least 6:1, can
be used for the production of EP and EPDM elastomers by
polymerization of the appropriate monomers.U.S. Patent No. 3,767,630 discloses that high
molecular weight copolymers of ethylene, propylene and
1,3-butadiene which are linear, unsaturated and
amorphous can be prepared by a process wherein the
aforementioned monomers are polymerized in the presence
of an aromatic hydrocarbon using a catalytic system that
comprises (a) at least one hydrocarbon
