<ABSTRACT>
A low density bioabsorbable non-woven fabric is 
disclosed. The fabric preferably includes fibers of glycolide and 

lactide and has a density of between about 0.05 g/cu.cm and about 
0.10 g/cu.cm. In one embodiment, the glycolide content of the 

fibers is at least about 80 mole percent, and preferably about 90 
mole percent. In an alternate embodiment, the glycolide content of 

the fibers is less than 30 mole percent, and preferably about 20 
mole percent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to non-woven fabrics, and
more particularly, to bioabsorbable non-woven fabrics for use in
medicine and surgery.Non-woven fabrics are porous, textile-like materials,
usually in flat sheet form, composed primarily or entirely of
fibers assembled in webs. Non-woven fabrics are also known as
bonded fabrics, formed fabrics, or engineered fabrics and are
manufactured by processes other than spinning, weaving or knitting.The basic structure of non-woven fabrics is based on
arrangements of fibers. Individual fibers are typically arranged
more or less randomly. The tensile, stress-strain, and tactile
properties of the non-woven fabric ordinarily stem from fiber to
fiber friction created by entanglement and reinforcement of yarns,
scrims, nettings and/or adhesive or other chemical and physical
bonding.Various methods are known for production of non-woven
fabrics and include such procedures as crimping of multifilament
yarn, cutting of yarn into staple fibers, carding of staple fibers,
air laying, wet forming, spunbonding, spunlacing, needlepunching
and stitchbonding. Such procedures are discussed generally in the
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 10, pp. 204-253
(1987) incorporated herein by reference. These methods and
others are used to produce non-woven fabrics from a variety of
polymeric materials. Certain non-woven fabrics have been used in medicine and
surgery as all-purpose pads, pledgets, wound dressings, sponges,
hemostats and the like. Bioabsorbable polymers such as lactide,
glycolide and dioxanone have been incorporated in non-woven fabrics
when contact with a wound or implantation into a patient's body is
a possibility. In U.S. Patent No. 3,875,937 polyglycolic acid is
described as being fashioned into sterile gauze, felt or velour
dressing and used to protect a wound surface or as a bolster to
prevent a suture from cutting into tissue. However, no guidance is
given relative to any procedures or specifications for forming such
a non-woven fabric. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,937,223 and 4,128,612
describe compacted surgical hemostatic felt and making absorbable
felt from polyglycolic acid or a polymer having an ordered
configuration of glycolic units and lactic acid units, or poly(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine).
The hemostatic felt is described as
produced by random formation by air scattering of a felt followed
by heat embossing. Heat embossing appears to be a crucial aspect
of the hemostatic felt, i.e., heat embossing and compacting fibers
on the tissue contacting
