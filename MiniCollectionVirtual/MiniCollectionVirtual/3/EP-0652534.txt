<ABSTRACT>
An exposing device is composed of a photosensitive 
drum (30) having a surface partitioned into a plurality 

of exposure areas in a scanning direction, for carrying 
an image formed by exposing the surface, a laser light 

source (18, 19) for emitting a laser beam, a polygon 
mirror (PM) for rotating at a constant speed to scan 

the surface of the photosensitive drum in the scanning 
direction with the laser beam from the laser light 

source (18, 19), and an exposure control circuit (11, 
12, 13) for producing items of emission data for one 

line while the number of emission data items for one dot 
is varied for each exposure area, and for supplying the 

emission data items for one line to the laser light 
source (18, 19) in response to a print clock pulse. 

Particularly, the exposure control circuit includes a 
CPU (11) for multiplying a reference value for the 

number of data items which should be selected from 
emission data items for a dot and changed in value to 

obtain a predetermined function, by a coefficient for an 
exposure area to which the emission data items for the 

dot are assigned, and for changing the value of each 
data item selected from the emission data items for 

the dot in number corresponding to a result of 
multiplication.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to laser printers having 
a function of correcting an fϑ error, and particularly, 
to an exposing device for the laser printer in which the 
fϑ error is corrected without using an fϑ lens. FIG. 1 shows an exposing section of conventional 
laser printers. In the laser printer, a laser diode 1 
is driven on the basis of image information to emit a 
laser beam toward a polygon mirror 3 rotating at a constant 
speed. The polygon mirror 3 reflects the laser 
beam according to its mirror angle fϑ so as to scan 
and selectively expose the surface of a photosensitive 
drum 2 in a direction shown in FIG. 1. In this exposing 
operation, an image for one line is formed on the 
surface of the photosensitive drum 2 as an electrostatic 
latent image. A dot is formed by driving the laser 
diode 1 continuously for a period of the dot exposing 
cycle. A space is formed by inhibiting the driving of 
the laser diode 1 continuously for a period of the dot 
exposing cycle. The photosensitive drum 2 is rotated by 
a preset amount each time the scanning is effected for 
one line. An image for lines thus obtained is developed 
as a toner image in which toner is adhered to dot 
portions, and transferred onto a sheet of paper. The scanning speed in the main scanning direction 
varies with the mirror angle fϑ of the polygon mirror 3. 
This is a factor which makes the sizes of dots forming  
 
an image on the surface of the photosensitive drum 2 to 
be non-uniform. For example, when the surface of the 
photosensitive drum 2 is partitioned into four exposure 
areas A, B, C and D sequentially scanned for 1/4 
scanning periods, the width of each dot is relatively 
large in the exposure areas A and D positioning at end 
portions of the photosensitive drum 2 and is relatively 
small in the exposure areas B and C positioning at 
center portions thereof. Conventionally, an fϑ error which thus occurs 
depending on a mirror angle fϑ is corrected by means of 
an fϑ lens (not shown) which is arranged between the 
polygon mirror 3 and the photosensitive drum 2 and 
refracts the laser beam from the polygon mirror 3 
according to the mirror angle fϑ such that the scanning 
speed is adjusted to be constant. In this correction 
technique, however, the total number of components is 
increased and a space for mounting the fϑ lens is 
required. Therefore, there is a problem that it is 
difficult to attain a laser printer of a small size and 
a low cost. As another correction technique, a technique which 
does not use an fϑ
