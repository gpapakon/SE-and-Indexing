<ABSTRACT>
A container closure (10) is disclosed which includes a shell (12) attachable to a container around a container opening thereof. The shell has a shell opening (20) in fluid communication with the container opening when the shell is attached to the container. A tip (14) is received on the shell movable between a closed position sealing the shell opening and an open position. A cover (16) is releasably attached to the shell in a manner indicative of the tip being positioned in the closed position when the cover is attached to the shell. Both the shell and the cover may be provided with tamper-evident bands (40, 62). The present invention is particularly well adapted to be formed as a push-pull container closure for sports bottles and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container closure
comprising the features of claim 1. It comprises
a shell adapted to be attached to a container
around a container opening thereof, said shell having a shell
opening adapted to be in fluid communication with the
container opening when said shell is attached to the
container; wherein said shell includes a central stem, said
shell opening is an annular opening surrounding said stem,
and said shell further includes an annular wall surrounding
said annular opening; a tip received on said shell movable
between a closed position sealing said shell opening and an
open position; and a cover releasably attached to said shell,
said cover indicative of said tip being positioned in said
closed position when said cover is attached to said shell.
Such a container closure is described in US Pat. No.
5,975,369. More specifically the present invention relates to
push-pull type container closures for sports water bottles
and the like.Further, preferred embodiments are disclosed in the
dependent claims 2-18.U.S. Patent No. 5,022,562 discloses a groove on the cover
engaging a ledge on the tip to allow the user to remove the
cover and open the tip in one motion. Many of the push-pull
type container closures of the prior art are difficult to
manufacture and do not effectively guarantee complete
resealing of the closure during operation.The object of the present invention is to overcome the
drawbacks of the prior art and to provide an easily 
manufactured container closure which provides a reliable
sealing condition.The objects of the present invention are achieved by
providing a container closure of the type mentioned above
wherein the shell further includes a cover-attaching member
positioned on said stem, and said cover-attaching member is
adapted to engage said cover to releasably attach said cover
to said shell.The cover may include a tamper-evident band on a lower
portion thereof. The cover may include a top, a cylindrical
side extending down from the top, wherein the tamper-evident
band is formed by a lower portion of the side below a score
line. The side above the score line may be flexed inwardly to
break off the tamper-evident band at the score line.
Alternatively, the cover of the present invention may provide
a device to prevent relative rotation of the tamper-evident
band in one or both directions. With the rotation prevention
device, continued rotation of the cover will break off the
tamper-evident band along the score line. The shell may also
be provided with
