<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical scanning system and to a method
of
optically scanning moving objects
to obtain optically encoded information from the surface of the
objects.Merchandise, various component parts, letters, moving
objects, containers and a whole gamut of related items being
shipped or transported, frequently must be identified with information
regarding origin, flight number, destination, name,
price, part number and numerous other kinds of information. In
other applications, the reading of encoded information printed on 
labels affixed to such items permits automation of sales figures
and inventory as well as the operation of electronic cash
registers. Other applications for such encoded labels include
the automated routing and sorting of mail, parcels, baggage, and
the like, and the placing of labels bearing manufacturing
instructions on raw materials or component parts in a
manufacturing process. Labels for these types of articles are
conventionally marked with bar codes, one of which is the
Universal Product Code. Numerous other bar code systems are also
known in the art.However, certain applications require the encoding of
larger amounts of information on labels of increasingly smaller
size. Commercially-available bar code systems sometimes lack
sufficient data density to accommodate these needs. Attempts to
reduce the overall size and spacing of bars in various bar code
systems in order to increase data density have not solved the
problem. Optical scanners having sufficient resolution to detect
bar codes comprising contrasting bars spaced five mils (1 mil = 1/1000 inch ; 1 inch â‰ƒ 2.54 cm) or less
apart are generally not economically feasible to manufacture
because of the close tolerances inherent in the label printing
process and the sophisticated optical apparatus required to
resolve bit-encoded bars of these dimensions. Alternatively, to
accommodate increased amounts of data, very large bar code labels
have been fabricated, with the result that such labels are not 
compact enough to fit on small articles. Another important
factor is the cost of the label medium, such as paper. A small
label has smaller paper costs than a large label. This cost is
an important factor in large volume operations.Therefore, other types of codes have been investigated
to overcome the problems associated with bar codes. Some
alternatives to bar codes are: circular formats using radially
disposed wedged-shaped coded elements, such as those disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 3,553,438, issued to Blitz, and
