<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are antibodies to peptides active in the structuredness of the cytoplasmic matrix test (SCM-factor peptides) and to fragments of the peptides by immunization of antibody-producing animals with the peptides or fragments. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be prepared. Particularly useful are antibodies specifically binding the peptides M-I-P-P-E-V-K-F-N-K-P-F-V-F-L-M-I-D-Q-N-T-K-V-P-L-F-M-G-K (SEQ ID NO: 2) and F-L-M-I-D-Q-N-T-K (SEQ ID NO: 3). The antibodies can be labeled and are suitable for performing immunoassays to detect the presence of SCM cancer-recognition factors in cell cultures or body fluids. One particularly useful immunoassay can distinguish SCM factor from partially homologous peptide sequences, and comprises: (a) incubating a first aliquot of the sample with a first antibody specific for the cancer-recognition factor to bind the first antiboby to the cancer-recognition factor in the first aliquot; (b) reacting a second aliquot of the sample with a second antiboby specific for the amino-terminal portion of the partially homologous peptide sequence to bind the second antibody to the partially homologous peptide sequence in the second aliquot; and (c) comparing the quantity of the first antibody bound to the first aliquot with the quantity of the second antibody bound to the second aliquot to detect the cancer recognition factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOCHEMICAL ASSAYS FOR CANCER-ASSOCIATED SCM RECOGNITION FACTORBACKGROUNDMany diseases occurring in humans and animals can be detected by the presence of foreign substances, particularly in the blood, the substances being specifically associated with a disease or condition. Tests for antigens or other such substances produced as a result of such diseases show great promise as a diagnostic tool for the early detection of the particular disease which produced the antigen or other substance. Procedures for the detection of such substances must be reliable, reproducible, and sensitive in order to constitute a practical diagnostic procedure for health care providers. In addition, any such procedure should be able to be carried out quickly and inexpensively by persons of ordinary skill and training in laboratory procedures.For example, in the treatment of the various malignancies that afflict humans and animals, referred to generally as cancer, it is recognized that early detection is the key to effective treatment, especially as most therapeutic procedures are more effective and safer in relatively early stages of cancer than in later stages. For example, many chemotherapeutic drugs that are toxic to malignant cells are also toxic to normal cells, and the higher doses required to cure or arrest more advanced cases of cancer can cause uncomfortable and serious side effects. Also, surgery is most often effective only before the di.^ease has spread or metastasized. Far too many cases of cancer are only discovered too late for effective treatment. 

 Accordingly, there has been and continues to be a great need for reliable tests that can diagnose cancer at early stages, and a great deal of research effort has gone to this end. In this connection new tests and procedures are being developed to effect early diagnosis of cancer.One extremely desirable aspect of such a test is its ability either to detect all types of cancer generally, and once the cancer is detected, identify the specific type of cancer, depending on the materials used. The former application of such a test is very important in mass screenings of large patient populations, as would be done in routine checkups. In such mass screenings a test dependent on a particular type of cancer would not be desirable, as there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of types of cancer and a test that could spot only one or a few types of the disease is far too likely to miss many cases of cancer. In general, these patients would present either no symptoms
