<ABSTRACT>
The diffusing elements are intended to facilitate the transfer of matter in solid-gas (endo- or exothermic) reactions between a reactive gas and a reactive composite material, and are embedded in the reactive composite material to facilitate the diffusion of the reactive gas, and are characterised in that,   a) these diffusion elements are sections made of carbonaceous porous material, b) these elements exhibit a low pressure drop in the so-called "direction of travel" of the reactive gas, c) in the so-called "direction of diffusion", perpendicular to the said direction of travel, these elements exhibit a measured crushing strength of at least 1 MPa and a permeability of at least 10

Diffuser elements intended to facilitate the mass 
transfer in solid/gas reactions (endothermic or exothermic) 

between a reactive gas and a reactive composite material 
comprising a reactive solid phase and a heat-conducting substrate 

phase based on expanded graphite which allow the exchange of heat 
between the core of said composite material and its external 

surface and are implanted in said reactive composite material to 
facilitate the diffusion of said reactive gas in the entirety of 

said reactive composite material are characterised in that 

a) these diffusion elements are profiles made of carbonaceous 
porous material (open porosity), 
b) these elements have a small head loss in the so-called 
"circulation" direction corresponding to the flow of said 

reactive gas from one end to the other of said element of less 
than 0.1 MPa per metre 
c) in the so-called "diffusion" direction 
perpendicular to said circulation direction, these elements have 

a measured resistance to crushing of at least 1 MPa and 
permeability of at least 10

Diffuser elements according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said elements form profiled elements in the form of plates, 

bars and tubes having, in the said diffusion direction, 
porosity of at least 20% and preferably higher than 30%. 
Diffuser elements according to claim 2, characterised in 
that said profiles form bars of porous carbonaceous material 

which is homogeneous in the said circulation direction and 
in the said diffusion direction. 
Diffuser elements according to claim 2, characterised in 
that said profiles form tubes. 
Diffuser elements according to claim 4, characterised in  
 

that said tubes have a thickness of less than 2 mm and a diameter 
which is preferably between 3 and 20 mm. 
Diffuser elements according to claim 5, characterised in 
that said tubes are of a composite carbon/carbon material.
