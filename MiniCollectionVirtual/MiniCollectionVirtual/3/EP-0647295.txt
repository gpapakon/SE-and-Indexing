<ABSTRACT>
A transmission device including a planetary gear train (7) with a ring gear (8) connected to the input (2a), and a sun wheel (9) counter-rotationally locked by a free-wheel (16). A planet pinion carrier (13) is connected to the output shaft (2ab). The ring gear(8) and the planet pinion carrier (13) may be coupled via a clutch (18a) which is compression-actuated by fly-weights (29) to ensure direct drive. When the clutch is released by an axial thrust (Pac) caused by the helical gearing and countering that of the fly-weights, the sun-wheel (9) is immobilized by the free-wheel (16) and the device operates as a reducing mechanism. The planetary gear train is arranged as an oil pump delivering through a duct (58) and through the stack of clutch discs (19, 22). When the clutch is actuated by the fly-weights, the delivery path is closed off, and the meshing motion between the gears forming the oil pump tends to be eliminated as a result. Therefore, the frictional process of the discs need only immobilize the gears to achieve direct drive. Ratio changes may be made more flexible, and clutch wear and heating may be reduced.

A ratio change control method in a transmission 
device comprising a combination of meshing sets of teeth (8, 

9, 11) capable of operating in a state of relative mobility 
in which the combination transmits power in a first speed 

ratio between a transmission output and input, or in a state 
of relative fixity to achieve a second speed ratio between 

the transmission output and input, the combination of meshing 
teeth taking the form of an hydraulic gear pump (9, 11, 51, 

57), in which method the second transmission ratio is 
controlled by substantially closing off the flow at the gear 

pump outlet, the first transmission ratio is controlled by 
releasing the flow at the gear pump outlet, and in order to 

pass from the first to the second ratio, after having at 
least partly closed off the flow at the gear pump outlet, a 

clutch (18a) is made to pass into the coupled state, said 
clutch tending in the coupled state to make the combination 

of teeth operate in the state of relative fixity and allowing 
in the uncoupled state the combination of teeth to assume the 

state of relative mobility corresponding to the first 
transmission ratio. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that, in order to control the state of relative mobility, the 

pump is made to deliver through a gap (64) between the 
friction elements (19, 22) of the clutch, so that in the 

clutch-engaged condition this gap (64) disappears and thus 
causes at least a reduction in the rate of flow at the pump 

outlet. 
A transmission device, which has at least two 
ratios and comprises a combination of teeth (8, 9, 11) 

capable of operating in a state of relative mobility in which 
the combination transmits power  

 
in a first speed ratio between the transmission input and 

output or in a state of relative fixity to achieve a second 
speed ratio between the transmission input and output, means 

for guiding oil (51, 54, 56) through regions of two sets of 
teeth (9, 11) in the combination which move towards each 

other during operation in the first transmission ratio, means 
(42, 43, 44, 46) for oil intake into the gaps between the 

teeth (52, 53) in at least one of these regions, an oil 
delivery path (57, 58, 62, 64) starting from a region (54) 

where the two sets of teeth (9, 11) start to mesh, ratio 
change control means (27, 29, 39) for selectively opening or 

substantially closing off the oil delivery path to control 
the operation in the first transmission ratio or operation in 

the second transmission ratio respectively, and a clutch 
(18a) which selectively connects two rotating elements (8, 

13) connected at least indirectly to the sets of teeth (8, 9, 
11) of the combination so that the combination of teeth works 

in the second transmission ratio when the clutch is in a 
coupled state, the ratio change control means also 

comprising means that, on passing from the first to the 
second transmission ratio, control the passage of the clutch 

(18a) to the coupled state after the said oil delivery path 
has been at least partially closed off. 
A transmission device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the means (27, 29, 39) for selectively 

opening or substantially closing off the oil delivery path 
are controlled automatically depending on a speed of rotation 

and/or a torque transmitted in the transmission device.  
 
A transmission device according to Claims 3 or 
4, characterised in that the clutch (18a) is of a friction 

type in which the friction elements are squeezed together 
when the clutch is in the coupled state and released to keep 

the clutch in the uncoupled state. 
A transmission device according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that a variable space (64) between the 

friction elements (19, 22) of the clutch substantially 
disappears when the friction elements are squeezed together, 

and in that the oil delivery path passes through this 
variable space (64) which forms part of the means for 

selectively opening or substantially closing off the oil 
delivery path. 
A transmission device according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that at least one of the two opposing 

friction faces between which the space is formed has grooves 
(62) which define oilways between the friction elements (19, 

22) at least when the friction elements are released and the 
clutch is consequently in the disengaged condition. 
A transmission device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the grooves (62) are closed off so as 

to close off the passage of oil in the grooves (62) when the 
clutch (18a) is in the engaged condition. 
A transmission device according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that the grooves (62) are closed off at one 

downstream end relative to the direction of flow of the oil 
along the grooves. 
A transmission device according to any one of 
Claims 5 to 9, characterised in that the clutch comprises a 

stack of axially-sliding discs (19, 22) alternately connected 
in rotation

is integral with a toothed crown wheel (8) of an epicyclic 
train (7) forming the combination of teeth, and the other

epicyclic train (7). 
A transmission device according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that the crown wheel (8) has helical teeth 

and is mounted so as to slide axially in order to operate the 
clutch (18a) in the direction of release due to the action of 

an axial thrust (Pac) generated by the helical teeth, a 
tachometric means (29) being also provided to push the crown 

wheel (8) in the direction of clutch engagement with a force 
that increases with the speed of rotation.
