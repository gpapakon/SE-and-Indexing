<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
liquid crystal polymer fiber reinforced thermoplastic 
composite material and a method for molding the same. Hitherto, FRP (fiber reinforced plastics) has 
been well-known. In general, as the reinforcing fiber of 
FRP, there has been used glass-fibers or carbon-fibers 
which are not thermoplastic polymer, so that it is difficult 
to remanufacture used FRP products, resulting in a big 
recycle problem at the present time. On the other hand, there is proposed a liquid 
crystal polymer composite material made from a thermoplastic 
polymer and a liquid crystal polymer as shown in 
Japanese Patent Kokai No.320128/1989. The composite material 
comprises liquid crystal polymer fibers dispersed in the 
thermoplastic matrix polymer, which are formed by means of 
in-situ composite molding. It has been found by us as shown 
in EP 0 524 655 A2 that the liquid crystal composite 
material can be remanufactured without degrading physical 
properties substantially below that of the original composite 
product. Now, hereinafter in the specification, the 
step of in-situ composite molding means that it is comprised 
of a step of mixing the thermoplastic polymer and 
the liquid crystal polymer to adjust a content of the  
 
liquid crystal polymer within a determined fiber formable 
range, a step of heating the mixture up to a temperature 
more than a liquid transition temperature and a step of 
melt-extruding it at a determined shearing rate sufficient 
to make the liquid crystal polymer into fibers in the 
matrix polymer as shown in EP 0 535 650 A2 and EP 0 566 149 
A2. However, after our sharp researches, it is found 
that in the case of the composite material manufactured by 
the in-situ composite molding, the reinforcing effect produced 
by the liquid crystal polymer fibers is limited to a 
lower value less than that desired and also the physical 
properties of the remanufactured product tends to decline 
gradually with the number of remanufacture. The present invention has been developed to 
overcome the above-described disadvantages. It is accordingly a first objective of the 
present invention to provide a remanufacturable liquid 
crystal polymer fiber reinforced thermoplastic (hereinafter 
referred to as LCPFRTP) composite material provided with 
physical properties superior to the conventional LCPFRTP 
composite material manufactured by in-situ composite 
molding. A second objective of the present invention is to 
provide a remanufacturable LCPFRTP composite blank
