<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves water soluble hydroxy-substituted texaphyrins retaining lipophilicity, of formula (I) wherein: M is H, a divalent or a trivalent metal cation; R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are independently H, OH, CnH(2n+1)Oy or OCnH(2n+1)Oy where at least one of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 has at least one hydroxy substituent; the molecular weight of any one of R1, R2, R3, R4 or R5 is less than or equal to about 1000 daltons; n is a positive integer or zero; y is zero or a positive integer less than or equal to (2n+1); and N is an integer between -20 and +2. These expanded porphyrin-like macrocycles are efficient chelators of divalent and trivalent metal ions. Various metal (e.g., transition, main group, and lanthanide) complexes of the hydroxy-substituted texaphyrin derivatives of the present invention have unusual water solubility and stability. They absorb light strongly in a physiologically important region (i.e. 690-880 nm). They have enhanced relaxivity and therefore are useful in magnetic resonance imaging. They form long-lived triplet states in high yield and act as photosensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen. Thus, they are useful for inactivation or destruction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), mononuclear or other cells infected with such virus as well as tumor cells. They are water soluble, yet they retain sufficient lipophilicity so as to have greater affinity for lipid rich areas such as atheroma and tumors. They may be used for magnetic resonance imaging followed by photodynamic tumor therapy in the treatment of atheroma and tumors. These properties, coupled with their high chemical stability and appreciable solubility in water, add to their usefulness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The porphyrins and related tetrapyrrole macrocycles are among the most
versatile of tetradentate ligands. Attempts to stabilize higher coordination geometries
with larger porphyrin-like aromatic macrocycles have met with little success. Only the
uranyl complex of "superphthalocyanine" has been isolated and characterized
structurally, although several other large porphyrin-like aromatic macrocycles,
including the "sapphyrins", "oxosapphyrins", "platyrins", "pentaphyrin", and
"[26]porphyrin", have been prepared in their metal free forms. Large, or "expanded"
porphyrin-like systems are of interest for several reasons: They could serve as aromatic
analogues of the better studied porphyrins or serve as biomimetic models for these or
other naturally occurring pyrrole-containing systems. In addition, large pyrrole
containing systems offer possibilities as novel metal binding macrocycles. For
instance, suitably designed systems could act as versatile ligands capable of binding
larger metal cations and/or stabilizing higher coordination geometries than those
routinely accommodated within the normally tetradentate ca. 2.0 Å radius porphyrin
core. The resulting complexes could have important application in the area of heavy
metal chelation therapy, serve as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
applications, act as vehicles for radioimmunological labeling work, or serve as new
systems for extending the range and scope of coordination chemistry. In addition, the
free-base 
(metal-free) and/or diamagnetic metal-containing materials could serve as useful
photosensitizers for photodynamic therapeutic applications. In recent years a number
of pentadentate polypyrrolic aromatic systems, including the "sapphyrins",
"oxosapphyrins", "smaragdyrins", "platyrins", and "pentaphyrin" have been prepared
and studied as their metal-free forms. For the most part, however, little or no
information is available for the corresponding metallated forms. Prior to this invention
the uranyl complex of "superphthalocyanine" was the only metal-containing
pentapyrrolic system which has been prepared and characterized structurally. The
"superphthalocyanine" system is not capable of existence in either its free-base or other
metal-containing forms. Thus, prior to the present invention, no versatile, structurally
characterized, pentadentate aromatic ligands were available, although a number of
nonaromatic pyridine-derived pentadentate systems had previously been reported.Gadolinium(III) complexes derived from strongly binding
