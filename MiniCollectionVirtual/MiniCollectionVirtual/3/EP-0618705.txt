<ABSTRACT>
The addresses of an irregular group of outputs of the node (ND) cannot be linked by a mathematical relationship. In order as regularly as possible to distribute cells applied to the input of the node, the latter includes translation circuits (T1, ... TN) determining, at the input of the network, an internal routing label identifying a regular subgroup of outputs, possibly consisting of a single output, according to an algorithm which is a function of the rank (j) of the input (Ij) receiving the said cell, and of the instant at which this cell was received. This algorithm thus achieves a spatial decorrelation and a time-based decorrelation of the cells. Application to ATM telecommunications networks.

Asynchronous switching node distributing cells dynamically to outputs
constituting an irregular group, the addresses of the outputs of an irregular

group not being mathematically related, said node including:

an input stage (T1, ..., TN) receiving cells on a plurality of inputs (I1, ...,
IN) and receiving for each cell external routing information (VPI-VCI), said first

stage adding to each cell an internal routing label (OPA; OPCA; OPSGA)
conditioned by the external routing data (VPI-VCI); and
a plurality of switching stages (SN) each including at least one switching
element each including means for transferring a cell received at one of its

inputs to at least one of its outputs according to the internal routing label (OPA;
OPCA; OPSGA) associated with said cell;

characterized in that the input stage (T1, ..., TN) includes means (M2j, M3j) for
selecting, for each cell addressed to an irregular group of outputs, a routing

label (OPA; OPCA; OPSGA) from predetermined internal routing labels
respectively identifying regular subgroups of outputs, the combination of which

constitutes said irregular group, each regular subgroup including a single output
or a plurality of outputs whose addresses are mathematically related;

and in that the label selecting means (M2j, M3j) select the label using an
algorithm which is dependent on the rank (j) of the input (Ij) receiving said cell.
Node according to claim 1, characterized in that the algorithm is also time-dependent.
Node according to claim 2, characterized in that the algorithm is dependent on
a variable consisting of the sum of said rank (j) and a time (t) incremented by

time units equal to the duration of a cell.
Node according to claim 1, characterized in that the algorithm is further
dependent on the bandwidth of each regular group constituting the group in

question.
Node according to any of claims 1 to 4 including switching stages having a
single-path routing capability characterized in that each predetermined routing

label (OPA) identifies only one output.
Node according to any of claims 1 to 4 including switching stages having a
single-path routing capability and further including, on the downstream side

thereof, an additional stage (S4) having the capability to distribute cells at
random in a regular group of outputs called a cluster, each cluster being made

up of outputs whose addresses have consecutive values, characterized in that
at least one of the predetermined internal routing labels (OPCA) identifies a

cluster of outputs.
Node according to any of claims 1 to 4 including at least one switching element
(S21, ...) with a multipath routing capability, that is including:


means for identifying a group of outputs called a routing group among the
outputs of said element providing access to one output of a regular subgroup

identified by an internal routing label (OPSGA); and
means for selecting an output from the group of outputs so identified;

characterized in that at least one of the predetermined routing labels (OPSGA)

identifies a regular subgroup including a plurality of outputs.
Node according to any of claims 1 to 4 for broadcasting a plurality of copies of a
cell to a respective plurality of destinations each of which can be an irregular

group, including at least one switching element with the capability to broadcast
a cell according to a predetermined broadcast tree, said element including:


means for identifying a plurality of groups of outputs of said element,
called routing groups, according to a broadcast tree number included in the

internal routing label of said cell;
means for selecting at least one output at random from the outputs of
each routing group so identified; and
means for sending a copy of said cell to each of the outputs so identified;

characterized in that at least one of the predetermined routing labels identifies a
broadcast tree enabling a copy of a cell to be routed to a regular subgroup

(SG1a; SG2c; SG3b) of each of the irregular groups (LG1, LG2, LG3)
constituting the destinations of said cell.
