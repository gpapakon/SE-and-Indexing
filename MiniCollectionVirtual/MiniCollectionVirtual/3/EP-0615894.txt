Passenger compartment structure for a motor vehicle 
comprising longitudinal members (1) and cross members (2) 

on which a sheet (3) forming the floor is arranged, 
fitting seats in the passenger compartment, characterized 

in that the anchoring elements (6) are riveted directly 
to cross members (2). 
Passenger compartment structure according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the anchoring elements are 

transverse rings (6) in the shape of an inverted U, the 
ends of the arms of the U being riveted to a cross member 

(2). 
Passenger compartment structure according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that each ring (6) passes through the 

sheet forming the floor (3) through a buttonhole-shaped 
aperture (8) made in the sheet. 
Passenger compartment structure according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that at least one cross 

member (2) comprises in its upper part two wings (7) 
extending in one and the same plane, and in that 

anchoring elements (6) are riveted to this cross member 
in pairs, the anchoring elements of one and the same pair 

being respectively riveted to the two wings (7) of the 
cross member in such a way as to be staggered in the 

longitudinal direction. 
Passenger compartment structure according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it comprises two 

cross members (12, 22) along which are spaced eight 
respective anchoring elements (6a to 6h) enabling a seat 

to be installed in five different positions along the 
said cross members.  

 
Passenger compartment structure according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that it also comprises two other cross 

members (32, 42) located at right angles to the vehicle's 
rear wheels, along which are spaced four respective 

anchoring elements (16b, 16d, 16e, 16g) enabling a seat 
to be installed in three different positions along the 

said other cross members. 
Passenger compartment structure according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the anchoring elements (16b, 16d, 

16e, 16g) riveted to the said other cross members 
(32, 42) are aligned in the transverse direction with the 

respective anchoring elements (6b, 6d, 6e, 6g) riveted to 
the first two cross members (12, 22).
