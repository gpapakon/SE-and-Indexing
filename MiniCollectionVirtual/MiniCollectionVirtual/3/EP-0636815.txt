<ABSTRACT>
A device for tensioning transmission belts or drive chains has a tensioning spring for pressing a tensioning lever, mounted in a fixed housing so as to be rotatable about an axis of rotation, against the transmission belt. The device also has a damping arrangement which comes into effect during pivoting movements of the tensioning lever, the tensioning lever rotating a first friction element which is arranged on the same axis of rotation and is pressed against a second friction element, which is secured against rotation. In order to achieve a tensioning device with sufficiently high and constant damping for the suppression of oscillations of the tensioning lever in all operating ranges, the first friction element (28) is arranged in such a way as to be axially displaceable relative to the tensioning lever (15). The first friction element (28) is pressed axially against the housing (10) forming the second friction element by the tensioning spring (13), which is inserted under preload. The tensioning lever (15) has a hub-shaped bearing part (23) which is arranged in a manner such that it is supported rotatably on the axis of rotation (19). The bearing part (23) has at least one driver (26), which is connected firmly in terms of rotation and which projects with positive engagement into a recess (27) in the first friction element (28). Arranged between the end of the tensioning spring (13) and the first friction element (28) is an axially displaceable mating friction ring (31) which is secured against rotation relative to the housing (10).

Apparatus for tensioning transmission belts or 
drive chains, having a helical spring (13), which is 

initially tensioned to prevent torsion, for pressing a 
tensioning lever (15) against the belt or the chain, which 

lever is rotatably mounted in a housing (10) on an axis of 
rotation (19), and said apparatus having a vibration 

damping arrangement which becomes operative if the 
tensioning lever (15) effects pivotal movements, a friction 

body (28) being non-rotatably, but axially displaceably, 
disposed on a hub-shaped bearing member (23) of the 

tensioning lever (15), which friction body is pivoted about 
the axis of rotation (19) and is axially pressed against 

the fixed housing (10) by the helical spring (13), 
characterised in that an axially displaceable 

counterfriction ring (31) is disposed between the end of 
the helical spring (13) and the friction body (28), which 

ring is prevented from pivoting relative to the housing 
(10) and is axially pressed against the friction body (28) 

by the helical spring (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a recess (27) of the friction body (28) is provided in 

a concentric guide extension member (51) of the friction 
body (28). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the counterfriction ring (31) has a U-shaped circular 

cross-section, the radially outer wall of the circle being 
provided with a slot (32), through which the leg (12) of 

the helical spring (13) protrudes into an axis-parallel 
elongate hole (11) in the housing (10). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the slot (43) has a radially outward
ly protruding lug  
 

(42), which projects into an elongate hole (11) in the 
housing (10). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised by 
the following features: 


the guide extension member (51) extends axially over the 
end of the bearing member (23) of the tensioning lever 

(15); and 
the counterfriction ring (31) is disposed in this region 
so as to surround the guide extension member (51) with 

sufficient clearance and is disposed in the housing (10) so 
as to fit with its outer radial wall. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the counterfriction ring (31) is disposed in the 

housing (10) with some clearance from the guide extension 
member (51). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that a helical ring (53) is disposed 

between the base of the helical spring (13) and the 
counterfriction ring (31), which helical ring compensates 

for the coil pitch of the helical spring (13) by its 
increasing height. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the recess or recesses (27) of the 

friction body (28) are greater, when viewed with respect to 
the circumferential direction, than the engaging 

entrainment means (26) of the bearing member (23), so that 
there is a specific clear passageway (61) between the 

friction body (28) and the bearing member (23). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in 
that an elastomeric body (63) is disposed in the clear 

passageway (61).
