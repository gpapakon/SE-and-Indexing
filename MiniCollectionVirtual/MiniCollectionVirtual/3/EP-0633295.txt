<ABSTRACT>
The invention aims at providing a resin composition for electronic parts which is in great demand as a circuit 
board material for electric and electronic equipments, and which has a low dielectric constant, low dielectric dissipation 

factor and a thermal resistance. This resin consists of a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin, and wollastonite 
or zonotolite, fibrous material containing CaO.SiO₂ as a main component, mixed as reinforcing fiber with the resin at 

a mixing ratio of 5-60 % based on the total weight of the resin and fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for reducing the
dielectric loss tangent of thermoplastic or thermosetting
resins which is highly demanded in electric and
electronic circuit board substrates.As the circuit board substrate material, the
so-called glass-epoxy board manufactured by impregnating
a glass mat with an epoxy resin, i.e. a thermosetting
resin, and causing the resin to cure is generally
employed. However, this substrate finds application only
in planar printed circuit boards and, moreover, having a
large dielectric constant of 4.5-5.5 and a large
dielectric loss tangent of 0.020-0.035, is not fully
satisfactory for the transmission of information because
of the following circumstances.Thus, the propagation delay time Td (ns/m) of
an electric signal can be expressed by the equation
Td=3.33√∈eff (∈eff: effective dielectric constant). It
is seen from this equation that the smaller the dielectric
constant, the shorter is the propagation delay
time and the higher is the propagation speed, thus 
enabling a high-speed operation. On the other hand, the
dielectric loss αD (dB/m) in a strip line is subject to
the relation αD=27.3 x (f/c) x √∈ x tanδ (f= frequency,
c=velocity of light, ∈= dielectric constant,
tanδ=dielectric loss tangent). Thus, in order to
decrease the dielectric loss, a substrate board with
small dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent
values must be employed.Recently, an injection-molded one-piece three-dimensional
circuit board comprising a substrate board, a
chassis and other structural components as a package has
been manufactured by employing a thermoplastic resin as
the resin matrix and either glass fiber, milled glass
fiber or potassium titanate whiskers as the fiber
reinforcement (JP-A-3035585)
or a granular inorganic filler (talc, calcium
pyrophosphate, etc.) without addition of reinforcing
fibers. However, for a further sophistication of data
communication or an enhancement of high-speed operability
of data processing equipment, still further decreases in
dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent are
needed.Reinforcing fibers are added for enhancing the
mechanical strength, improving the resistance to heat
deformation during a soldering operation and reducing the 
coefficient of linear expansion (improving dimensional
accuracy) of the matrix resin. However, with glass fiber
or milled glass fiber, the dielectric constant of the
substrate can be held comparatively low but the
disadvantage occurs that because the dielectric loss is
increased, the signal
