<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a manufacturing process and a related product constituted of a tile in plastic material. The process comprises the following operative stages: crushing a thermoplastic material of recovery; injecting quality plastic material (Fig. 1) into a mould (3) with a primary punch (1A) and a matrix (2) associated to enable the formation of the first layer (4) of the tile (5) between them; rotating (Fig. 2) the mould (3) to reverse the reciprocal position of the matrix (2) and of the primary punch (1A); replacing the primary punch (1A) with a secondary punch (1B) to mark out, in its association with the matrix (2), between the first layer (4), supported by the matrix (2) and the secondary punch (1B), a cavity (6) to contain the thermoplastic material of recovery; injecting thermoplastic material of recovery into the cavity (6) with the formation of a second layer (7) of plastic material arranged inside the tile (5) (Fig. 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention concerns a manufacturing 
process and a composite tile of plastic material of 
recovery obtained by said process. The plastic materials composed of the waste of some 
industrial processes ( for example in the shoe-making 
sector) , and/or coming from plastic objects of 
current use being put out of use, are frequently 
crushed to be used again in subsequent transformations. The latter recovery operation, however, is not always 
cost-effective and possible as the crushed material 
in some cases assumes such poor properties that it is 
not possible to use it again not even in the 
manufacture of low quality products. WO-A 89 07 219 teaches a process for injection molding a thin-walled, 
hollow plastic product. According to this process a 
first common mold part is combined with a first complementary 
mold part to assemble a first mold cavity; portions of the first 
complementary mold part contact portions of the first common 
mold part to rigidly secure mold parts in a position which impedes 
movement of the mold parts in relation to each other  
 
during injection of a first plastic material into the first mold 
cavity whereby the first plastic material is shaped such that 
when it is contained in a second mold cavity, which is formed by 
combining the first common mold part with a second complementary 
mold part, it provides stabilizing regions that rigidly secure 
the mold parts in a position which impedes movement during injection 
of a second plastic material. This process is preferably 
used to combine a transparent second plastic material with a 
non-transparent first plastic material thereby providing transparent 
windows in a side wall of a container. As a consequence of this it is known that much 
plastic waste is accumulated in landfills, causing 
considerable storage problems as it cannot be burned 
due to the environmental pollution that would ensue  
 
from its combustion process. The purpose of this present invention, as 
characterised by its claims, is therefore to 
eliminate the above mentioned drawbacks. The invention solves the problem of making , by means 
of a suitable manufacturing process, a composite tile 
in which plastic material of a suitable quality for 
the environment the tile will be used in is injected 
into a mould so as to form an outer shell of the tile 
, inside which, at a later stage, plastic material of 
recovery is injected with the function of filling the 
tile. The fundamental advantage abtained by this present 
invention lies in the fact

Manufacturing process of a composite material including the 
following operative stages: 


crushing a first plastic material; 
injecting a second plastic material into a mould (3) with 
a primary punch (1A) and a matrix (2) associated to enable 

the formation of a first layer (4) between them; 
rotating said mould (3) to reverse the reciprocal position 
of said matrix (2) and of said primary punch (1A); 
replacing said primary punch (1A) with a secondary punch 
(1B) to mark out between said first layer (4) supported by 

said matrix (2) and said secondary punch (1B), a cavity (6) 
to contain said first plastic material; 
injecting said first plastic material into said cavity (6) 
with the formation of a second layer (7) of plastic 

material,
characterised in that
as first plastic material a plastic material of recovery is 
used, 
as second plastic material a quality plastic material is 
used, and 
a composite tile is formed wherein said first layer (4) 
surrounds the second layer (7) on one face (8) and on at 

least one outer edge (9) so as to hide said second layer 
(7) of plastic material of recovery. 
Composite tile obtained with the process in accordance with 
claim 1, wherein the tile comprises a first layer (4) of a 

quality plastic material surrounding a second layer (7) of 
a thermoplastic material of recovery on one face (8) and on 

at least one outer edge (9) wherein the second layer (7) is 
hidden by the first layer (4).  

 
Tile in accordance with claim 2, characterised by the 
fact that said outer edge (9) has at least one shaped 

cavity (10) and at least one protruding element (11) 
shaped as a complement to said cavity (10) so they 

will combine geometrically to enable the joint of 
said tile (5) with at least one coplanar adjacent 

tile (5). 
Tile in accordance with claim 2, characterised by the 
fact that said first layer (4) has one face (12) 

provided with protuberances (13). 
Tile in accordance with claim 2, characterised by the 
fact that said first layer (4) is made of fluorescent 

plastic. 
Tile in accordance with claim 3, characterised by the 
fact that said protruding element (11) and said 

cavity (10) have an elliptical shape. 
Tile in accordance with claim 3, characterised by the 
fact that said protruding element (11) and said 

cavity (10) have a dovetail shape.
