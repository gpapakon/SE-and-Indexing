<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixer having a vibratory drive for a movably mounted object holder. A mixer which can perform multidimensional vibratory movements at frequencies of up to 20 kHz is characterised in that the object holder is mounted on a Y frame (7, 5) which is horizontally movable in the Y direction, which Y frame is supported on an X frame (4, 5) which is horizontally movable in the X direction by at least one Y spring (6) which can be deflected in the Y direction, in that the X frame is suspended on at least one X spring (3) which can be deflected in the X direction, which X spring is supported on a base plate and in that vibratory drives engage on the Y frame and on the X frame, which vibratory drives comprise permanent magnets (21) and drive coils (25) arranged opposite them.

Mixer, having an oscillatory drive for a
displaceably mounted object support (18), which is mounted

on a "Y" frame (7, 5), which is horizontally displaceable
in the Y direction, which Y frame (7, 5) is supported on an

"X" frame (4, 5), which is horizontally displaceable in
the X direction, by at least one Y spring (6), which is

deflectable in the Y direction, which X frame (4, 5) is
suspended from at least one X spring (3), which is

deflectable in the X direction and is supported on a base
plate (1), characterised in that the object support (18)

communicates with a resilient plate (19), which is
deflectable in the "Z" direction and is connected to the Y

frame (7), via hinges (17) with hinge axes extending in the
X direction, in that the hinges (17) are additionally

connected to at least one Z spring (15), which is
deflectable in the Z direction, via resilient sheets (16)

which are deflectable in the Y direction, in that the Z
spring (15) is connected to the X frame (4) and

additionally communicates with a Z frame (23), which is
displaceable in the Z direction, and in that oscillatory

drives co-operate with the Y frame (7), with the X frame
(4) and with the Z frame (23), which drives comprise

permanent magnets (21) and drive windings (25), which are
disposed opposite said magnets.
Mixer according to claim (1) [1?], characterised in

that the Y springs (6) and the X springs (3) are configured
as leaf springs.
Mixer according to claim 2, characterised in that
the Y frame (7, 5) and the X frame (4, 5) have a

rectangular to square configuration, and in that their
associated leaf springs each communicate with sides of the

frames lying opposite one another. 
Mixer according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised by at least one means for two-dimensionally

changing the resilience constant formed from a unilaterally
clamped-in resilient rod (8) and a mass (12), which is

displaceable longitudinally of the resilient rod (8).
Mixer according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised by at least one means for one-dimensionally

changing the resilience constant formed from a unilaterally
clamped-in resilient rod (8) or from a unilaterally

clamped-in leaf spring, which rod or spring is guided in a
fork (34), which is displaceable parallel to the resilient

rod (8), or respectively relative to the leaf spring, the
fork (34) being guided in a housing (28), which is disposed

adjacent the resilient rod (8), or respectively adjacent
the leaf spring, and being displaceable with a setting

drive, more especially spindle drive (30, 32).
Mixer according to claim 5, characterised in that
the means for one-dimensionally changing the resilience

constant co-operates with at least one X spring (3)
of the X frame (4, 5).
Mixer according to one of claims 4 or 5,
characterised in that a means for changing the resilience

constant is disposed between the X frame (4, 5), or
respectively between the Y frame (7, 5), and the base plate

(1), the resilient rod (8) being guided in a pivotal
bearing (10) of the Y frame (7, 5).
Mixer according to one of claims 4 or 5,
characterised in that a means for changing the resilience

constant is disposed between the Z frame (23) and the base
plate (1), the horizontally extending resilient rod (8)

being clamped in position on the base plate (1) or on a
component part connected thereto and being guided in a

pivotal bearing (10) of the Z frame (23). 
Mixer according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the oscillatory drives can be

controlled and/or regulated independently on one another in
respect of frequency, amplitude and phase.
Mixer according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that a means is provided for detecting the

operational parameters of the individual oscillatory drives
in dependence on the time.
