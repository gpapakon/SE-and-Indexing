<ABSTRACT>
A first transistor is connected to a second transistor so 
that the first and second transistors may be initially biased 

in a non-conducting state when a first node is at a first 
voltage potential and a second node is at a second voltage 

potential. A potential altering circuit selectively alters 
the voltage potential at the first and second nodes, causes 

the first and second transistors to be in a conducting state 
for accelerating a voltage transistion at the first and second 

nodes toward final values, and maintains the first and second 
nodes at their final voltage potentials for implementing a 

desired Boolean function. 
The biasing circuit is connected to facilitate turning 
off the first and second transistors when the circuit is being 

reset for subsequent Boolean evaluations. More specifically, 
the biasing circuit inhibits current flow through the first 

and second transistors during a precharge operation to prevent 
excessive power consumption. 
The circuit according to the present invention may be 
employed in a number of logic applications such as simple 

OR/NOR or AND/NAND circuits, generalized parallel/serial logic 
networks, comparators, etc.. When employed in a chain, such 

as in a generalized parallel/serial logic network, NMOS 
circuit elements may be employed together with gate coupling 

circuitry to ensure high speed operation with minimum size.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic circuit according to the preamble of claim 1,
i.e. to circuits which implement Boolean functions.Many software and hardware applications require the
implementation of Boolean functions such as AND, OR, NAND,
NOR, EXCLUSIVE-OR, etc. Most Boolean functions may be
implemented by interconnecting a plurality of transistors in
such a way that binary signals representing input values are
applied to control terminals of the transistors and the result
of the logical expression is output from a node somewhere
within the circuit. The circuits are often classified as
static or dynamic. For example, Fig. 1 is a schematic
diagram of a static circuit 10 known from EP-A-0 647 029 for implementing a NOR
function (A+B). Circuit 10 comprises PMOS transistors 14, 18
and NMOS transistors 22, 26. The binary signal representing
the A value is applied to a gate terminal 30 of PMOS
transistor 14 and to a gate terminal 34 of NMOS transistor 26
The binary signal representing the B value is applied to a
gate terminal 34 of PMOS transistor 18 and to a gate terminal
38 of NMOS transistor 22. A source terminal 42 of PMOS
transistor 14 is coupled to a VDD potential, and a drain
terminal 46 of PMOS transistor 14 is coupled to a source
terminal 50 of PMOS transistor 18 at a node 54. A drain
terminal 58 of PMOS transistor 18 is coupled to an (A+B)
output line 62 at a node 64. Drain terminals 68, 72 of NMOS
transistors 22, 26 respectively are coupled to (A+B) output
line 62 at respective nodes 76 and 78. Source terminals 82,
84 of NMOS transistors 22 and 26 are coupled to a ground
potential. From inspection of circuit 10, it should be
readily apparent that when both A and B are low, then 
transistors 14 and 18 conduct current into node 64. At this
time transistors 22 and 26 are nonconducting. Thus, output
line 62 is pulled high. On the other hand, if either A or B
are high, then the respective PMOS transistor 14 or 18 is
rendered nonconducting. Simultaneously, one or both of NMOS
transistors 22 or 26 conducts current away from node 64, and
output line 62 is pulled low.One problem with circuit 10 is that, since PMOS
transistors are not as conductive as NMOS transistors for a
given size, PMOS transistors 14 and 18 typically must have a
considerably larger size than transistors 22 and 26. Not only
does this consume valuable chip area, but the logic elements
which generate the A and B signals must therefore drive more
input capacitance. Another problem, shared by all static
circuits of this type (and
