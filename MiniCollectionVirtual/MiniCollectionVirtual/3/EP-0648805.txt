<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to curing systems based on 
polysulfide derivatives of 1,3,4-thiadiazole and their use in curing 
chlorine-containing polymers. In the past, chlorine-containing polymers have been compounded 
with curatives and other ingredients for vulcanization into 
vulcanizates for use in various industrial and consumer 
applications. Many known curing accelerators, however, are highly 
active at relatively low temperatures and consequently may cause 
premature vulcanization or scorching. This phenomenon may lead to 
unsatisfactory physical properties of the vulcanizate. One type of accelerators based on 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole 
is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,510. A disadvantage of known 1,3,4-thiadiazole curing agents is poor 
bin storage stability. That is, the viscosity tends to increase 
during storage of the chlorinated polymer compounded with the 
thiadiazole based curative. The increased viscosity requires tedious 
process control, as for example frequent adjustment of machine 
settings.  Surprisingly, it has been discovered that certain 
organopolysulfide derivatives of 1,3,4-thiadiazole are effective 
curing agents for chlorinated polymers and futhermore, display 
excellent bin storage stability when compounded with the polymer. In accordance with the invention, there is provided an improved 
curing system for chlorinated polymer compositions. The curable compositions comprise a mixture of saturated and 
unsaturated chlorine containing polymers and a polysulfide derivative 
of 1,3,4-thiadiazole or mixtures of such derivatives having the 
formula 
wherein R and R' are the same or different organic radicals 
containing from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, m and n are numbers from 1 to 
about 8, the sum of m and n being at least 2. Another aspect of the invention relates to a process of 
crosslinking saturated and unsaturated chlorine containing polymers 
with a polysulfide derivative of 1,3,4-thiadiazole or mixtures of 
such derivatives having the formula (I) and in the presence of an 
organic amine. The organopolysulfide derivatives of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole 
useful as curing agents or curing accelerators in 
accordance with the present invention may be liquid or waxy solid 
materials depending on the nature of the substituent R and R' 
groups. The more preferred derivatives are those having the formula 
wherein R and R' are the same or different aliphatic, cycloalphatic 
or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, including alkyl, aralkyl, aryl and 
alkaryl radicals, as
