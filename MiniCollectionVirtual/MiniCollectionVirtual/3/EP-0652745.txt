<ABSTRACT>
A pulse release implant comprising: an axial biodegradable core; a first concentric layer comprising dehydrated hydrogel containing an active ingredient; and an outer coating, said outer coating being removable by the environment in which the implant will reside after administration. A process of preparing a pulse release implant including the steps of: coating an axially disposed biodegradable core material with a hydrogel containing an active ingredient to form a concentric coating; separating the coating into discrete segments disposed along the core material; dehydrating the hydrogel; coating the discrete segments with an outer coating, said outer coating being removable by the environment in which the implant will reside after administration; and removing the exposed core material to obtain the pulse release implants.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTROLLED RELEASE IMPLANTSFTELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to implants containing active ingredients, especially drugs or veterinary products suitable for administration to humans and animals in which the active ingredient is required to be administered in a pulsatile release profile.Prior art implants are typically of the reservoir type and usually contain a single active ingredient and provide the continuous release of the active in a zero or first order mode of release kinetics.Present methods of making these prior art implants use basically two approaches, viz, (i) tabletting; and (ϋ) melt processing. Representatives of these approaches are described as follows:(i) Tabletting (International Patent Application No. PCT/AU87/00139)A water insoluble excipient (eg, calcium phosphate) is thoroughly mixed with a bioactive agent such as a protein or peptide in an amount sufficient to give the required dosage unit of active ingredient in the final product. The bioactive agent is usually in the form of a solution or dispersion or powder to facilitate mixing. A water soluble excipient (eg, lactose), if used, is then added, together with the other desired additives, eg, a lubricating agent such as magnesium stearate, and mixed to form a homogeneous dry powder. The powder is then compressed into a tablet of the desired size and shape. The compressed tablet is then coated in a pan coater by spraying with a solution or dispersion of the coating material in an amount sufficient to give implants with the required coating thickness.In an alternative coating method known as Wurster coating, the tablet is coated in a fluidized bed system. 

(ϋ) Melt Processing ("A sustained release Ivermectin implant for livestock pest control" hy T Allan Miller. R O Drummond, D D Oehler in "Controlled Release Delivery Systems" ed. Theodore J Roseman and S Z Mansdorfr 983.Marcel-Dekker; Chapter 15, pp 223-236) An implant containing 20% Ivermectin was formulated by dissolving technicalIvermectin in a melt of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (MW 15,000 - 20,000). The solution was then drawn by vacuum into a 3 mm internal diameter Teflon tube and allowed to cool. Upon cooling the resultant solid rod (3mm diameter) was removed and trimmed to the desired weight of 400 mg.Implant products of this type are solid cylindrical rods of varying length and diameter and can have shapes ranging from flat discs to fine needles. This type of implant is useful where a prolonged continuous supply of the drug is required.The pan coating and Wurster

CLAIMS:-
1. A pulse release implant comprising: an axial biodegradable core; a first concentric layer comprising dehydrated hydrogel containing an active ingredient; and an outer coating, said outer coating being removable by the environment in which the implant wiU reside after administration.
2. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the hydrogel is selected from gelatine, agar, alginates, carrageenan, gum gragacanth, acacia, and corn starch.
3. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the first concentric layer further includes one or more components selected from disintegrating agents, lubricants or osmotic modifiers.
4. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the active ingredient is a pharmaceutical substance.
5. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the pharmaceutical substance is an antibody, cytokine, growth promotant, hormones, cancer ceU inhibitory molecule or agent, immune stimulant, and/or immune suppressant.
6. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the active ingredient is an antigen or an anti-microbial, anti-fungal or anti-viral agent.
7. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the active ingredient is a nutrient, vitamin or mineral.
8. A pulse release implant according to claim 6 wherein said antigen is an antigen from the clostridial famUy. 


9. A pulse release implant according to claim 1 wherein the outer coating is formed from a material selected from modified starches, sugars, polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, bioerodible polyesters and polylactic/polyglycolic acids.
10. A pulse release implant according to claim 9 wherein the outer coating is formed from polylactic/polyglycolic acids.
11. A process of preparing a pulse release implant including the steps of: coating an axially disposed biodegradable core material with a hydrogel containing an active ingredient to form a concentric coating; separating the coating into discrete segments disposed along the core material; dehydrating the hydrogel; coating the discrete segments with an outer coating, said outer coating being removable by the environment in which the implant wiU reside after administration; and removing the exposed core material to obtain the pulse release implants.
12. A process according to claim 11 wherein the separation step takes place before the dehydration step prior to coating with the outer coating.
13. A process according to claim 11 wherein the separation step takes place after the dehydration step prior to coating with the outer coating.
14. A process according to claim 11 wherein the outer coating is apphed by forming said coating in a mould and subsequently removing said mould.
15. A process according to claim 11 wherein said outer coating is formed by dipping the hydrogel coated biodegradable core into a coating solution.
16. A process according to claim 11 wherein said outer coating is formed by spraying said hydrogel coated biodegradable core. 


17. A process according to claim 11 wherein said outer coating is formed by apphcation of the coating material to the hydrogel coated biodegradable core via a rod or wick.
