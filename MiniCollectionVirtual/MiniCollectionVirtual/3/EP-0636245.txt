<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists in a gas sensing device employing a piezo-electric element coated with a sensor material which interacts with a range of gases selectively, the oscillation frequency of the piezo-electric element varying with the degree of interaction with an analyte gas and thus with the particular gas. It has been found that polymers previously known in liquid crystal applications, and in particular polysiloxanes, are highly suited for use as sensor materials, giving advantages which have no relevance to liquid crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS SENSING DEVICESThis invention relates to gas sensing devices, "gas" in this specification being takento include vapour.Gas sensing devices are known, of a kind in which a piezo-electric component iscoated with a sensor material having characteristics of mass, stiffness and viscosity. Thesensor material interacts with gaseous materials, in this context analytes, selectively, toproduce a change in one or other of the characteristics such as to affect the oscillation frequency of the piezo-electric component when incorporated in an oscillator circuit.Some sensor materials are relatively non-discriminating, causing a similar reaction toa wide range of gases, while others are fairly selective. Other problems with known sensormaterials include inadequate repeatability of response, insufficiently rapid response tostimulation, and limited 'designability' of response to suit specific gases.An object of the present invention is to provide a sensor material for a gas sensingdevice which at least partly overcomes one or more of these disadvantages.According to one aspect of the present invention a gas sensing device comprises apiezo-electric component connected in an oscillator circuit to oscillate at the componentresonant frequency, the piezo-electric component being loaded with a polysiloxane sensormaterial which interacts with a range of gaseous analyte materials so as to alter the oscillation frequency response resulting from such interaction being indicative of the analyte material, and the sensor material being a polysiloxane having the general formula: 

 wherein M is a mesogenic group having a general structure:and wherein:Me is methyl;D and E are either alkyl, typically methyl or ethyl, or alkyl cyanides, (CH~)_ CN, the rings P & Q are selected from phenyl, trans-cyclo hexyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, dioxanyl, and bicyclo (2.2.2) octyle;m is 0 or 1 ;Y is R„ OR,, Hal (F,Cl,Br,I), CF3, CO2R, or CN when = 1and R„ OR,, Hal (F,Cl,Br,I), CO2R, or CN when m = 0;where R,is alkyl, open chain or branched, containing 1-12 carbon atoms;A is COO, OOC or CH2.CH2;X and Z are selected independently from H, methyl and Hal such that one at least ofX, Y and Z contains fluorine;the ratio b:a is less than 3:1 and > 0.Preferably the piezo-electric oscillating component is coated with a polymer selected
