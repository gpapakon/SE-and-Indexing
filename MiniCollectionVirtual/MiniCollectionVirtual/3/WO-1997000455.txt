<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for determining the distance (h) between a base (1) and a reflecting surface (2) of an object (3). The direct reflection of the radiation from a first light source (4) is measured by a first detector (5) and the radiation from a second light source (6) located at least approximately at the same place as the first detector (5) is measured by a second detector (7) located at least approximately at the same place as the first light source (4). The position of the reflecting surface (2) relative to the base (1) is then determined based on the known geometry of the structure and the measurement values for the apparent angles ( gamma ,  alpha ) formed by the virtual images of the light sources (4, 6).
