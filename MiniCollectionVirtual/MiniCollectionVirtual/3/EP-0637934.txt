<DESCRIPTION>
Part of the work performed during development of this invention
utilized U.S. Government funds. The U.S. Government has certain rights
in this invention.The present invention relates to an apparatus for
locating a nerve, and more particularly the invention relates to a method
and apparatus for precisely locating and identifying a specific peripheral
nerve; and an apparatus for testing tissue during surgery to
determine if it contains or is near an important nerve. The practice of regional anesthesia (the administration of
anesthesia to a specific body region) is not new. Today, increasing
numbers of patients are receiving nerve blocks for anesthetic purposes
during surgery and for extended relief of trauma or chronic pain.Successful administration of regional anesthesia depends primarily
on the accurate placement of anesthesia in relation to the target nerve.
For sensory nerves, accuracy of placement is determined by paresthesia
(a buzzing or tingling sensation) reported by the patient to the physician.
Obviously, the success rate of a nerve block will be low when the patient
gives an inaccurate report of paresthesia or when the patient is
disoriented, sedated or otherwise not fully functional. Equally critical to
the success of a nerve block is the skill or experience of the
anesthesiologist attempting to localize a nerve.In an effort to increase the success rate of a nerve block, some
anesthesiologists x-ray patients before administering anesthetic solution to
determine the exact location of the anesthesia needle vis-a-vis the target
nerve. Although somewhat helpful, this technique proves to be
impractical, expensive, and not always readily available.More recently, peripheral nerve stimulators have been put into
practice as a means of effectively locating peripheral nerves. Nerve
localization via electrical stimulation is based on the fact that an electrical
pulse can stimulate a nerve fiber to contract an innervated muscle or
cause paresthesia in the case of sensory nerve stimulation.Over the years, nerve stimulators have taken the form of insulated
(or uninsulated) anesthesia needles connected to a source of electricity.
To localize a nerve, the electrified anesthesia needle is placed within the
tissue of the body in the vicinity of the nerve to be blocked. The needle
is then used as a stimulating probe until stimulation of the target nerve
is achieved as determined by visually detecting muscle contractions or by 
eliciting a report that the patient feels the stimulus. The current supplied
by the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for locating a nerve comprising:

a surgical instrument (22, 122) for delivering a stimulus to a nerve;
a detector (15) for detecting a response of the nerve to the stimulus delivered to the nerve by
said surgical instrument;
a recorder for recording the detected intensity of the response of the nerve;
means for evaluating the recorded response of the nerve, wherein a predetermined parameter of the recorded response
is evaluated

by said evaluating means to provide a response evaluation result;
a modulator (16, 24; 116) for automatically modulating the magnitude of a subsequent stimulus delivered
to the nerve, wherein said modulator modifies the subsequent stimulus delivered to the nerve

based on the response evaluation result provided by said evaluation means
so as to hold the level of the nerve's response substantially

constant at a predetermined value; and
an indicator (18, 18'; 118, 118') for conveying to the user the proximity of the surgical instrument relative to the
nerve.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said surgical instrument comprises
a needle (22).
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2, wherein said surgical instrument comprises
a probe (122).
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said surgical instrument comprises
a pair of scissors.
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said detector comprises a pair of
electrodes (15). 
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said detector comprises mercury-filled

distensible tubing.
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said detector comprises a Doppler
flow head.
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said detector comprises an
accelerometer transducing muscle movement.
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said modulator is a computer (24).
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims, wherein said indicator conveys the proximity
of said surgical instrument relative to the nerve as a unit of distance.
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 9, wherein said indicator conveys the proximity
of said surgical instrument relative to the nerve in volts.
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 9, wherein said indicator conveys the proximity
of said surgical instrument relative to the nerve as a variable audible tone. 
The apparatus of any of claims 2 to 12 as far as they refer to claims 2 or 12
wherein said needle (22) is adapted for injecting a drug.
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims wherein said modulator modifies the
duration of said stimulus.
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims wherein said modulator modifies the
frequency of said stimulus. 
The apparatus of any of the preceding claims wherein said response detecting means is a
tumescence monitor.
