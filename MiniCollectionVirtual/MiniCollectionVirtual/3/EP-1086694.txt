<ABSTRACT>
The pharmaceutical formulation consists of a number of pellets that comprise an
inert nucleus, a layer with the active ingredient, one or more intermediate layers that

comprise at least a system of modified release, and an external layer of enteric coating.
These pellets can be obtained applying the different layers by means of fluid bed

coaling techniques using aqueous solutions or suspensions of the components of such
layers. The pharmaceutical formulations can be hard gelatin capsules or tablets and are

suitable for use in the prevention and treatment of disorders related to abnormal gastric

acid secretion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new pharmaceutical formulations that contain an acid labile benzimidazole compound, suitable for oral administration, constituted of a number of pellets that comprise the active ingredient, one or more intermediate layers that comprise, at least, a system of modified release, and an external enteric coating. The invention also refers to the procedure for the production of said pellets and pharmaceutical formulations and to the use thereof in Medicine.The compound, 5-methoxy-2[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulphinyl]-1H-benzimidazole, is a benzimidazole compound suitable for inhibiting the gastric secretion in mammals. In particular, it is suitable for the prevention and treatment of disorders related with the secretion of gastric acid, for example, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, reflux esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, etc. Other benzimidazole compounds with anti-ulcer activity are pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole.Omeprazole, just as is the case with other benzimidazole compounds that have therapeutic interest, is an acid labile compound. This causes numerous problems when it comes to developing a pharmaceutical formulation for oral administration due to the fact that when said compound comes into contact with the stomach content, which is a strongly acidic environment, degradation occurs. This lability may be responsible for the variability of the intra- and inter-individual therapeutic response of omeprazole.To avoid contact between acid labile compounds and gastric juice after oral administration of said compounds, solid pharmaceutical formulations have been developed that comprise a nucleus that contains the acid labile compound and an external layer that constitutes a gastro-resistant coating that may be separated by one or more intermediate layers. In some cases, conventional enteric coatings of acidic nature cannot be used because the active compound would decompose on contact, either direct or indirect, with this coating. This would be evidenced by a colour change and by a reduction in the amount of active compound after a time.There are several ways of solving the problem related to the stability of the active compound. One of these consists of creating an alkaline environment around the acid labile benzimidazole compound, which is achieved using alkaline salts of the benzimidazole compound and/or incorporating a compound of alkaline reaction in the pharmaceutical gastro-resistant preparation [see, for example, European patent application
