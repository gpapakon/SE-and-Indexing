<ABSTRACT>
A thin film transistor structure having a first and a second 
polycrystalline silicon 

layer (36,40) of different conductivity types (P and N) has a high 
resistance contact at the 

resultant P-N junction (42). This contact resistance is reduced by 
forming TiSiâ‚‚ (titanium 

disilicide) or other refractory metal silicides (56) such as cobalt or 
molybdenum in specific 

regions, namely the P-N junction contact. Titanium disilicide consumes 
the portion of the 

second polycrystalline silicon layer (40) in the P-N contact junction 
(42) and at the same time 

consumes a small portion of the underlying first polycrystalline 
silicon layer (36), such that the 

high resistance P-N junction (42) now no longer exists.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor integrated circuit
processing, and more specifically to a transistor structure having low contact resistance
at the P-N junction or diode where contact or interconnect between at least two regions
having different conductivity type occurs, such as in thin film technology.PN diode interconnection technology, such as thin-film transistor (TFT) or
polycrystalline silicon technology, is used in SRAM and video display technology because
of the high density advantage it provides. In thin-film transistor technology, P-channel
polycrystalline silicon transistors are generally used as the PMOS load with the NMOS
drivers and passgates built in the single crystal substrate. The use of P-channel
transistors as the load for the SRAM cell usually results in better electrical characteristics
than n-channel transistors, and they are typically faster than resistive loads. Additionally,
P-channel transistors provide greater immunity to noise.In spite of the benefits associated with the use of polycrystalline silicon P-channel
transistors as load transistors, a disadvantage arises when interconnection between
polycrystalline silicon lines having different conductivity types occurs, causing high
resistance contacts to be formed. TFT technology of three polycrystalline silicon layers
of different conductivity types will result in polycrystalline silicon interconnect lines of
different conductivity making contact. For instance, interconnection between a P+
polycrystalline silicon layer and an adjacent N+ polycrystalline silicon layer results in a
high resistance contact being formed at the resultant P-N junction. In a three layer
polycrystalline silicon transistor, with the second and third layers composed of N+ and P+
materials, respectively, a high resistance contact is formed at the P-N junction between
the second and third polycrystalline silicon layers. In one prior art document, US-A-4333099, an active region
of a semiconductor device is contacted by an opposite
conductivity polysilicon line and the resulting PN junction is
resolved by selective deposition of metal - hereby sputtering,
following by annealing.A second prior art document, EP-A-0503904 discloses a method
of making a static RAM and a static RAM structure in which a
silicide is deposited on top of a first conductivity region
before further regions of second conductivity type are formed
over the first region.It is an object of the present invention to at least
mitigate the difficulties of the prior
