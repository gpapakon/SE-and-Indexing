<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronically 
controlled fluid pressure braking system for heavy duty 
vehicles. Existing heavy duty vehicles are equipped with 
pneumatic braking systems in which the brakes are actuated 
by pneumatic control signals generated by the vehicle 
operator by operating a treadle actuated brake valve. In 
order to simplify the system and to speed up brake 
application and release, it has been proposed to equip such 
vehicles with electronic controls. Instead of transmitting 
brake control signals pneumatically through conduits, such 
electropneumatic braking systems generate electrical signals 
actuating the brakes of the vehicle by operating modulating 
valves which control communication between a fluid pressure 
source and the brakes of the vehicle. Such a prior art 
electropneumatic system is disclosed in U.S. patent 
4,749,238. This system discloses an electropneumatic system 
in which brake control signals are generated electrically 
and the brake application effected is controlled by a 
modulator controlled by the magnitude of the electrical 
signal.  
 EP-A-0 467 112 discloses a 
controller which responds to a step increment between the 
actual and control signals to effect braking.  
 In order to speed up control and force the 
modulator to more closely follow the braking pressure being 
demanded by the vehicle operator, the present invention 
provides a master controller which scales the braking 
request signal generated by the vehicle operator and 
transmits a braking request signal to wheel controllers at 
each wheel of the vehicle. The wheel controllers receive 
the braking request signal from the master or central 
controller, and also receive feedback signals generated by 
pressure sensors which respond to actual braking pressure 
generated by the modulator. The wheel controllers generate 
electrical signals which control the modulator. 
Accordingly, closed loop pressure control is achieved. The  
 
wheel controllers include an open loop controller which 
converts the signal received from the master controller to a 
signal operating the modulator. Using this relationship, 
the pressure in the modulator eventually will become near 
the desired pressure, but the transient pressure response is 
too long. Accordingly, in order to improve the response, 
particularly when the braking pressure being demanded by the 
vehicle operator is rapidly increased or decreased, the 
modulator is driven more aggressively by providing a step 
increment in the actuating signal changes

Method of controlling braking pressure in a fluid pressure braking system comprising 
the steps of generating a demanded braking pressure signal representing demanded braking 

pressure, measuring actual braking pressure and generating an actual braking pressure signal 
representing actual braking pressure, calculating a control signal for controlling an electrically 

actuated proportional brake pressure modulator for controlling braking pressure as a function 
of the magnitude of said control signal applied to the modulator, said control signal being 

calculated by a proportional-integral-differential controller from the demanded braking 
pressure signal and the actual braking pressure signal when changes in the pressure demand 

signal, and the difference between the actual braking pressure signal and the demanded braking 
pressure signal do not satisfy predetermined criteria, and modifying the magnitude of said

becomes substantially zero.
