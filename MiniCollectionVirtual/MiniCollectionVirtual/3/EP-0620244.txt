<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxially stretched
film for food packaging having a layer composed of a
polyamide-based mixed resin and a process for its production. More particularly it relates
to a biaxially stretched food packaging film having at
least one layer composed of an aliphatic polyamide, an
amorphous polyamide, a xylilene-based polyamide and a
nylon 6-modified ionomer or a mixture of a nylon 6-modified
ionomer and a polyolefin, and having excellent
transparency, oxygen-gas barrier properties, moisture
permeation resistance, toughness and flexibility.Thermoplastic films containing polyamides are
popularly used in the field of food packaging. Films of
aliphatic polyamides which are a popular resin in
polyamides, have many excellent properties such as high
toughness, oil resistance and transparency, but they also
involve some serious problems: they are deteriorated in
oxygen-gas barrier properties under a high-humidity
condition because of hygroscopicity, and may show
unsatisfactory in mechanical strength when subjected to a
severe treatment such as boiling treatment or retort
sterilization.Also, resistance to moisture vapor permeability of the
film is low due to the moisture-absorption, and there would 
take place loss of weight and/or deterioration of flavor
and taste of the packaged food due to dissipation of
moisture in food through the films during long-time storage
of packaged food. Thus, the aliphatic polyamide films were
unsatisfactory for practical use.In an effort to overcome these defects of aliphatic
polyamide films, there have been proposed a biaxially
stretched film composed of a mixture of an aliphatic
polyamide and a xylilene-based polyamide, and improved in
pinhole resistance, elasticity and gas barrier properties
(Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) Nos. 51-29193 and 63-43217)
and a heat-shrinkable multi-layered film composed of
an aliphatic polyamide and an amorphous polyamide and
improved in stretchability and heat shrinking properties
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 3-63133).There has also been proposed a polyamide film composed
of a mixture of a crystalline polyamide mainly composed of
a xylilenediamine and a dicarboxylic acid, and an amorphous
polyamide mainly composed of isophthalic acid, terephthalic
acid and a diamine, and having excellent oxygen barrier
properties and transparency (Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 64-6056).However, any of the conventional films mentioned above
was still unsatisfactory for use as a practical
