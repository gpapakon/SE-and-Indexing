<ABSTRACT>
A collecting container for centrally collected materials, having at least one insertion aperture (5) for the material and an emptying aperture for emptying the filled container with the aid of a lifting apparatus which has the necessary strength and durability for the intended purpose, is characterised by a supporting construction consisting of a base frame (1), profiled columns (2) at the corners of the container and a stable upper connection (17) between the profiled columns (2), and wall parts (6) which extend between the profiled columns (2) and adjoin the base frame (1). The collecting container according to the invention can be transported as a "construction kit" and erected at the recipient's premises.

A collection receptacle for centrally collected 
materials with at least one loading aperture (5) for the 

material and a discharging aperture formed by base flaps and 
with an actuating mechanism for the base flaps, which 

mechanism is guided through the receptacle and can be 
operated from the top by means of a lifting device, 

characterised in that a base frame (1), column profiles (2) 
in the corners of the receptacle and an upper, stable 

connection (17) of the column profiles (2) form a stable 
supporting structure, to which wall sections (6) are 

secured, which extend between the column profiles (2) and 
adjoin the base frame (1), the base flaps are articulated to 

the base frame (1) and the actuating mechanism is secured 
and guided on the upper, stable connection (17) of the 

column profiles (2). 
A collection receptacle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the column profiles (2) are tubes 

having a closed, preferably round cross section.

characterised in that the base frame (1) comprises an 

inwardly pointing horizontal web (10) and the wall sections 
(6) engage under the web with a folded edge (12). 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the wall sections (6) comprise 

lateral extensions (8), by means of which the wall sections 
can be connected to the column profiles (2). 
A collection receptacle according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the extensions (8) of adjacent wall 

sections (6) overlap on an inner side of the column profiles 
(2) and can be secured together in the overlap region to the 

respective column profile (2).  
 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the column profiles (2) are 

connected by at least one mechanical connecting element to 
the base frame (1). 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the connection between wall 

sections (6) and column profiles (2) is effected by means of 
mechanical connecting elements. 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
7, characterised by a roof section (3) connected to the 

upper ends of the column profiles (2). 
A collection receptacle according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the loading aperture is constructed in 

an intermediate space (5) between the wall sections (6) and 
the roof section (3). 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
9, characterised by strutting (17) connecting the upper ends 

of the column profiles (2). 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
10, characterised in that all mechanical connecting elements 

are arranged so as to be invisible from the outside. 
A collection receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 
11, characterised in that all connections between the base 

frame (1), wall sections (6), column profiles (2) and 
optionally roof section (3) are effected by means of 

mechanical connecting elements.
