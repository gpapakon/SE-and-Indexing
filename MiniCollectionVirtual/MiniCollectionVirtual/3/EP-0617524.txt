<ABSTRACT>
The method serves for transmitting digital signals over a radio channel on a predefined frequency band between a transmission base station (13; 23) and mobile stations (6). At least one repeater station (14; 24) is used to receive radio signals sent by the transmission base station and to resend radio signals intended for mobile stations on the same frequency band. The spectrum of the radio signals sent by the transmission base station (13; 23) intended for the repeater station (14; 24) is inverted with respect to the spectrum of the radio signals resent by the repeater station (14; 24) intended for the mobile stations (6). Used especially in radio telephonic communications networks.

A method of transmitting digital signals by radio
over a predefined frequency band between a base station (13;23)

and mobile stations (6), wherein at least one repeater station
(14;24) is used to receive radio signals transmitted by the base

station and to retransmit radio signals to the mobile stations in
the same frequency band, characterized in that the spectrum of

the radio signals transmitted by the base station (13;23) to the
repeater station (14;24) is reversed relative to the spectrum of

the radio signals retransmitted by the repeater station (14;24)
to the mobile stations (6).
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
spectrum reversal in the repeater station (14;24) is performed by

radio transposition means without regenerating the digital
signal.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that prior to modulating the digital signal for transmission by

the base station (13), said signal is subjected to a logical
transformation which, after modulation about an offset frequency,

produces a radio signal whose spectrum is reversed with respect
to the spectrum that it would have in the absence of said logical

transformation.
A repeater station (14;24) for implementing a method
according to any one of claims 1 to 3, comprising first

transmission and reception means (8) for communicating with a
base station (13;23), second transmission and reception means

(9,10) for communicating with mobile stations (6), a first line
(11;21) for processing the radio signals received by the first

transmission and reception means prior to retransmission by the
second transmission and reception means, and a second line (12)

for processing the radio signals received by the second
transmission and reception means prior to retransmission by the

first transmission and reception means, said first line (11;21)
including at least one supradyne transposition circuit 

(28,29;28a,29a) for performing spectrum reversal of the radio
signal.
A radiotelephone communications network comprising at
least one telephone exchange station (1), base stations (3,13,23)

connected to the telephone ex change station for providing a
digital radiotelephone interface, and repeater stations (14,24)

for receiving radio signals transmitted by at least one of the
base stations (13,23) and for retransmitting radio signals in the

same frequency band to mobile stations (6), characterized in that
the base station (13,23) and the repeater station (14,24) are

arranged so that the spectrum of the radio signal emitted by the
base station and received by the repeater station is reversed

relative to the spectrum of the radio signals retransmitted by
the repeater station to the mobile stations (6).
