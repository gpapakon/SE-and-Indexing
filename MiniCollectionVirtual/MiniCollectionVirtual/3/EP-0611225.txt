<ABSTRACT>
The assembly comprises a metaphysial element (1) and a diaphysial element (2) in two separate and independent parts, each element (1) and (2) having a specific anteroposterior sagittal curvature, in order to correspond with the anatomical double curvature of the femur and have coupling arrangements which are suited, on the one hand, to solidly attaching them with a capacity for free rotation at the moment of introduction into the medullary canal for their auto-adaptation and, on the other hand, to solidly attach them while creating an effect of compressing the metaphysial element (1) with respect to the diaphysial element (2) after introduction into the medullary canal.

Repair femoral shaft for hip prosthesis, 
consisting of a metaphyseal element (1) and a 

diaphyseal element (2) in two distinct and 
independent parts, with coupling features, 

characterised in that each element (1) and (2) has a 
specific antero-posterior sagittal curvature (1a) 

(2a) to correspond with the double anatomic curvature 
of the femur, the coupling features of said elements 

being capable, on the one hand, of more firmly 
joining them with the capacity for free rotation at 

the moment of introduction into the medullary canal 
for their auto-adaptation, and, on the other hand, of 

more firmly joining them by creating a compression 
effect of the metaphyseal element (1) relative to the 

diaphyseal element (2), after introduction into the 
medullary canal. 
Shaft according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the features consist of a through-hole (1c) 

formed through the entire height of the metaphyseal 
element (1), to receive, with the capacity of 

rotation, a cylindrical surface (2c) formed at the 
extremity of the diaphyseal element (2) and the 

extremity of which (2c1) is shaped to cooperate with 
at least an attached means of assembly (3) of the 

metaphyseal element (1). 
Shaft according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the means consists of a nut (3), lodged in a 

recess (1c1) in the through-hole (1c) of the 
metaphyseal element (1), and co-operating with a 

threaded surface (2c1), formed at the end of the 
cylindrical surface (2c).  

 
Shaft according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the cylindrical surface (2c), at the level of 

its joining to the diaphyseal element, bears a 
tapered surface (2c2) co-operating with a 

complementary surface (1c2) in the hole (1c) of the 
metaphyseal element (1). 
Shaft according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the distal extremity of the diaphyseal 

element (2) bears a slot (2d). 
Shaft according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the diaphyseal element (2) is covered, either 

directly or by the intermediary of an attached 
element of a dense ceramic non- osteoconductive 

material, the resorption of which is programmable by 
modifying the composition of said material. 
Shaft according to claim 1, characterised 
in that it consists of several diaphyseal elements 

(2) composed of a circular shaft of different 
diameters and different lengths.
