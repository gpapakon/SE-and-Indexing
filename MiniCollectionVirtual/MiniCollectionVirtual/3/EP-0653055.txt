<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of determining the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths of the drum (1) of a drum filter rotatably suspended on a shaft (4). Recorded are the changes in the total mass (weight) of the drum (1) of the drum filter which correspond to the changes in the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths and to the changes in the height of the level of soiled liquid inside the drum (1) of the drum filter. The device for carrying out the method comprises a drum (1) rotatably suspended on at least two suspension-type supporting members (2) embracing the shaft (4) mounted on the stationary frame (6) of the drum filter. At least one force recorder (7) is provided for between the shaft (4) and the stationary frame (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
A Method of Determining the Amount of Waste Deposited on Filter Cloths of a Drum Filter and a Device for Carrying Out the MethodTechnical FieldThe invention relates to a method of determining the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths of a drum filter rotatably suspended on a shaft and to a device for carrying out said method in which the drum is rotatably mounted on at least two suspen¬ sion-type supporting members embracing a shaft seated on the stationary frame of the drum filter.Background of the InventionDrum filters contain a rotatably mounted drum fitted on its circumference with filter cloths and with two face holes out of which through one, an inlet hole, soiled liquid, as a rule water, is led inside, while through the other, the outlet hole, impurities are let out, for instance by means of an off-take trough. The lower part of the drum filter is immersed in the filtered liquid, and the level of the soiled liquid inside the drum of the drum filter is higher than the level of the filtered liquid outside the drum filter.In the heretofore known devices, the determining of the waste amount deposited on the filter cloth of a drum filter is carried out by devices recording the level heights inside and outside the drum filter, for instance by means of float-operated switching on and off systems, or by means of electronic, pres¬ sure or optical feelers disadvantageous in that they 

are apt easily to take up the waste contained in the soiled liquid with the ensuing deterioration of the functional accuracy..The rotation of the drum of the drum filter results in undulation of the liquid levels which is another cause of incorrect working of the level height feelers. In addition to the limited reliability of the function, other drawbacks of the known devices consist in their complicated design, high production costs, and poor response to the changes in the level height .Disclosure of the InventionThe above specified drawbacks are removed by a method of determining the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths of the drum of a drum filter rotatab¬ ly suspended on a shaft whose principle consists in that there are recorded the changes in the total mass (weight) of the drum of the drum filter which correspond to the changes in the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths and to the changes in the height of the level of soiled liquid^ inside the drum of the drum filter.The device for carrying out the method according to the invention comprises a drum rotatably suspended on at least two suspension-type

PATENT CLAIMS
l.A method of determining the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths of a drum filter rotatably suspended on a shaft characterized by that there are recorded the changes in the total mass (weight) of the drum (1) of the drum filter which correspond to the changes in the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths and to the changes of the level of soiled liquid inside the drum (1) of the drum filter.
2. A device for carrying out the method of determining the amount of waste deposited on filter cloths of the drum of a drum filter as claimed in Claim 1, in which the drum of the drum filter is rotatably mounted on at least two suspension-type supporting members embracing a shaft seated on the stationary frame of the drum filter, characterized by that at least one force recorder (7) is provided for between the shaft (4) and the stationary frame (6).
3. A device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized by that the force recorder (7) is seated under the shaft (4) at the place where the shaft is embraced by the supporting member (2).
4. A device as claimed in Claim 3, characterized by that the shaft (4) is mounted on a lever (5) swing- ingly seated on the stationary frame (6) of a drum filter, and that the force recorder (7) is seated between the arm of the lever (5) and the stationary frame (6) .
