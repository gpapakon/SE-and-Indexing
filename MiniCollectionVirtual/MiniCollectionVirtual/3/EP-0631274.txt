<ABSTRACT>
An improved long-term predictor (LTP) for use in analysis-by-synthesis 
coding systems, such as CELP is disclosed. The invention provides control of the 

periodicity of speech signals generated by the LTP. This control facilitates a 
reduction in perceptible noise/buzziness in reconstructed speech. An embodiment of 

the invention includes a conventional LTP in combination with a two-tap finite 
impulse response filter. The filter augments operation of the LTP by generating 

precursor signals of LTP output signals. These precursor signals are combined with 
the LTP output signals to form the output of the improved LTP.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related generally to speech coding systems and
more specifically to speech coding systems with pitch prediction.Speech coding systems function to provide codeword representations of
speech signals for communication over a channel or network to one or more system
receivers. Each system receiver reconstructs speech signals from received
codewords. The amount of codeword information communicated by a system in a
given time period defines the system bandwidth and affects the quality of the speech
received by system receivers.The objective for speech coding systems is to provide the best trade-off
between speech quality and bandwidth, given conditions such as the input signal
quality, channel quality, bandwidth limitations, and cost. To reduce speech coding
system bandwidth, redundancy is removed from the speech signal prior to
transmission. Among the redundancies that can be exploited is the periodic nature of
voiced speech. In many speech coders, this long-term redundancy is removed with a
pitch or long-term predictor. At the system receiver a second long-term predictor is
used to regenerate the periodicity in the reconstructed speech signal. Note that the
term long-term predictor often refers to related but different structures in the system
receiver and the system transmitter.Long-term predictors are commonly applied to a class of coders called
analysis-by-synthesis coders. A well-known representative of this class is code-excited
linear prediction (CELP). In analysis-by-synthesis coders, speech signals are
coded using a waveform-matching procedure. The speech is divided into segments
which are called subframes. For each subframe, a candidate reconstructed speech
signal is constructed for each of a large set of parameter configurations. Each of the
parameter configurations is fully defined by a number of indices. Each candidate is
compared to the original speech signal to determine which candidate most closely
matches the original speech. The matching procedure is tailored to the properties of
the human auditory system through the use of perceptual weighting. The indices
corresponding to the best matching candidate reconstructed speech signal are
transmitted over the channel. From the indices, the system receiver determines the
correct parameter configuration and creates the reconstructed speech signal. In analysis-by-synthesis coders, the long-term predictor generally is an
integral part of the waveform matching process. In a common configuration, the
long-term predictor uses a
