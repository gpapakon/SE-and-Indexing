<ABSTRACT>
A mattress or a like body-supporting element comprising a 
foam core assembly (1) having at least two foam core halves 

(2, 3) disposed on top of each other, each of the main 
surfaces of the foam core halves (2, 3), which main surfaces 

face each other, being provided with a contour surface (4) to 
form cavities (11, 15), the contour surfaces (4) of the two 

foam core halves being complementary. 
In accordance with a further elaboration of the 
invention, the complementary contour surfaces (4) 

substantially completely adjoin each other in a manufacturing 
state, the two foam core halves (2, 3) in the manufacturing 

state forming a rectangular block, the two foam core halves 
(2, 3) in a service state being displaced relative to each 

other such that at least a plurality of the tops (12) formed 
by the contour surfaces (4) abut against each other and the 

two foam core halves (2, 3) in the service state forming a 
rectangular block having a greater thickness than the 

rectangular block of the manufacturing state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a body-supporting element
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a body-supporting element is known from
DE-A-28 20 282.For the sake of readability, the application will hereinafter
only refer to a mattress. However, it is understood
that the invention also relates to, for instance, seat
cushions for couches and other body-supporting elements.Conventional mattresses provided with cavities are
rather expensive in manufacturing. Generally, the known
mattresses with cavities functioning as ventilating ducts
are manufactured from two layers of full-foam material, with
parts being cut away from the full-foam layers to form the
cavities, after which, subsequently, the full-foam layers
are placed on top of each other and interconnected by means
of, for instance, glueing. The parts cut away from the full-foam
layers form waste, causing a considerable loss item in
manufacturing.DE-A-28 20 282 overcomes the disadvantages of the
conventional mattresses for a large part. After displacing
the foam core halves from the manufacturing position to the
service position, the obtained body-supporting element needs
to be cut at the longitudinal ends to obtain a rectangular
block form. The object of the invention is to provide a mattress of
a like body-supporting element having a foam core assembly
provided with at least one cavity, the intended mattress
being producible at a price equal to that of a mattress
having a full-foam core which is approximately 2-4 cm
thinner and for which an equal quantity of foam material has
been used.To this end, in accordance with the invention, the
mattress or the body-supporting element is characterized by
the features of claim 1.A thus composed foam core assembly can be manufactured
from a layer of full-foam material which is divided into two
foam core halves by means of a separating operation, such
as, for instance, cutting or sawing. The contour surfaces
are formed through the separating operation. Because the
contour surfaces are completely complementary to each other, both foam
core halves can be manufactured without any waste of foam
material.Further, the foam core assembly can be manufactured
from a relatively thin layer of full-foam material, the
displacement of the foam core halves, which are obtained
through the separating operation, resulting in a foam core
assembly of a greater thickness than the original layer of
full-foam material and having ventilating ducts or like
cavities. As the foam core halves form a rectangular block
both in the service

first longitudinal directon end and a second longitudinal end
and having at least one cavity, the foam core assembly (1)

comprising at least two foam core halves (2, 3) disposed on top
of each other, each of the main surfaces of the foam core

halves (2, 3), which main surfaces face each other, being
provided with a contour surface (4) to form the cavities (11,

15), the contour surfaces (4) of the two foam core halves (2,
3) comprising a number of top parts (12) and being complementary

to each other;
