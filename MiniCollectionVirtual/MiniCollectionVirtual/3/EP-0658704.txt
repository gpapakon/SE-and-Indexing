<ABSTRACT>
A transmission is described having orbital (planetary) gears (1) including at least one planet gear (5) meshing with a central sun gear (2) and an external gear (8), the said planet gears (5) being mounted so that each can pivot at the free end (19) of a flexible shaft (6), while the other end (18) of this flexible shaft (6) is firmly attached to the planet gear carrier (4). This transmission (1) is noteworthy in that the gearings are helical gears, in that the planet gears (5) are mounted so that they can swivel and in that they are associated with a device for compensating for the tilting torque (34, 80) making it possible to hold them in position.

<CLAIMS>
Transmission with orbital gears and spread load,
the said transmission (1) comprising a central planetary

gear (2) with a geometric axis of rotation (3), an
external planetary gear (8) and at least one planet

pinion (5) that meshes simultaneously with the central
planetary gear (2) and the external planetary gear (8),

the planet pinions (5) each being mounted so that they
can rotate freely on a bearing (9) on the free end (19)

of a flexible shaft (6) of geometric axis (7), the other
end (18) of which is secured to the planet carrier (4),

characterized in that the gears are helical gears, in
that the planet pinions (5) rotate on bearings (9) of the

self-aligning type and in that each planet pinion (5) is
secured to the inner race (37) of a bearing (35) the

outer race (38) of which slides in a direction perpendicular
to the plane defined by the geometric axes (3)

and (7) while the inner race (37) slides in the direction
of the geometric axis (7).
Transmission according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the bearing (35) is offset towards the planet

carrier (4).
Transmission according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the outer race (38) of the bearing (35)

at its periphery comprises two planar and mutually
parallel surfaces (39A) and (39B).
Transmission according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the outer race (38) slides on its faces (39A) and

(39B) between the faces (40A) and (40B) of a guide (40),
the said faces (40A, 40B) themselves being planar, 

mutually parallel, parallel to the axis (7) and perpendicular
to the plane defined by the axes (3) and (7).
Transmission with orbital gears and spread load,
the said transmission (1) comprising a central planetary

gear (2) with a geometric axis of rotation (3), an
external planetary gear (8) and at least one planet

pinion (5) that meshes simultaneously with the central
planetary gear (2) and the external planetary gear (8),

the planet pinions (5) each being mounted so that they
can rotate freely on a bearing (9) on the free end (19)

of a flexible shaft (6) of geometric axis (7), the other
end (18) of which is secured to the planet carrier (4),

characterized in that the gears are helical gears, in
that the planet pinions (5) rotate on bearings (9) of

which the inner race (13) pivots on a swivel joint (62)
mounted on the shaft (6), and in that the said inner race

(13) is secured to at least one pin (81) the end (83) of
which fits between the walls (84A) and (84B) of a slot

(84), the said slot (84) being stationary with respective
to the planet carrier (4), the said walls (84A) and (84B)

being planar, parallel to each other and to the geometric
axis (7) and perpendicular to the plane defined by the

geometric axes (3) and (7).
Transmission according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the inner race (13) is secured to two pins (81)

which are diametrically opposed with respect to the
geometric axis (7).
Transmission according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that the slots (84) are made in a shoulder

(23) of the shaft (6).
