<ABSTRACT>
In order to connect, in an electrically conductive manner, a component which is arranged in the interior of an insulating glass pane to a component located outside the insulating glass pane, a pin (6) which engages through openings (4, 5) in the spacer frame (1) and consists of an electrically conductive material is embedded in a plastic (7) which is rigid at ambient temperature. The pin (6) inserted into the spacer frame (1) projects, by means of its two ends, beyond the walls (2, 3), which exhibit the openings (4, 5), of the spacer frame (1) and is set up (10, 11) there for connection to electric lines (8, 9). The pin (6) is insulated with respect to the spacer frame (1) by the portions (12, 13) of the plastic (7) which are located in the region of the openings (4, 5).
