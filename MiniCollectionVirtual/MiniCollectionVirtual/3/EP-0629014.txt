<CLAIMS>
A process to humidify process gas for the operation of fuel cells in 
which a pre-determined volume of finely atomised water is injected 

from a supply line (6) into a gas supply line (2) in the fuel cell (1) by 
means of an injection nozzle (5), whereby a reference value for the 

volume of water to be supplied is calculated on the basis of operating 
parameters and set by the actuation of a metering valve (7) located in 

the supply line (6). 
A process in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the process air of an air-breathing 
fuel cell (1) is humidified. 
A device to carry out the process in accordance with Claim 1 with a 
fuel cell (1), a gas supply line (2) to supply process gas to the fuel cell 

(1), an injection nozzle (5) to inject water from a supply line (6) 
connected to the injection nozzle (5) into the gas supply line (2), a 

device (5, 8) to atomise the water, a metering valve (7) positioned in 
the supply line (6) and a control device (9) to actuate the metering 

valve (7) in accordance with operating conditions parameters. 
A device in accordance with Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the device (5, 8) to atomise the 
water works on the basis of air-assisted injection nozzles or ultra 

sound atomisers.
