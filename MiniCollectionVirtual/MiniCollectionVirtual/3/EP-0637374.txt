<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vibration testing
equipment for simulating vibration and shock loads on
an article under test, and more particularly, to a
vibration table driven by a hydraulic servo
valve-controlled piston actuator for vibrating the
table at high frequencies and/or high force levels.
Embodiments of the invention include a double-acting
piston actuator with an integrated servo valve
controller for a hydraulic vibration test table, and
multiple-axis, multiple degree-of-freedom vibration
test fixtures.The vibration test industry, including all major
aerospace firms, automotive manufacturers, electronics
companies, and the like, has adopted use of various
methods and systems to simulate vibration and shock
environments for determining their products'
effectiveness and longevity when subjected to these
environmental extremes. Vibration testing is often
used to develop vibration-tolerant designs; some use it
to verify that a product will survive in its intended
vibrating environment; others use it to screen out
defective parts at an early stage in the manufacturing 
process. For instance, vibration and shock testing
often involves the testing of electronic circuit boards
adapted for use in spacecraft, airplanes, automobiles,
etc. The boards are subjected to vibration testing,
often at high frequencies, or high force levels, to
determine whether or not they will survive the shaking
required when the hardware is placed in use.In the past, test fixtures in the form of
"vibration tables" have been used for producing
vibration and shock loads on an article under test.
These vibration tables (which are also referred to as
oil film tables, slip tables, or bearing tables)
include a horizontal or vertical table on which the
test article is mounted. The table is vibrated at a
desired frequency, force level, and/or amplitude during
testing. One such vibration test fixture is
manufactured and sold under the name T-Film Table by
Team Corporation, South El Monte, CA, the assignee of
this application. This vibration test fixture is
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,996,881, incorporated herein
by this reference.Vibration testing has traditionally been done with
the test article restrained to move in a single axis.
Recent studies show, however, that vibration testing in
three mutually exclusive axes simultaneously can
simulate real world conditions better than single axis
testing. The present invention, in one embodiment,
comprises a vibration test fixture adapted for single
axis vibration; other embodiments of the
