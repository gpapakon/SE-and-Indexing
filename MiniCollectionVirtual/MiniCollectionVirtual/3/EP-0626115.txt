<ABSTRACT>
A system for communication by means of microwaves between transponders (3) and a central unit (5) is described. It is primarily characterized by a communication unit (4) for directed communication at a relatively short distance with the transponders (3) and at a relatively long distance with the central unit (5). The communication unit (4) also comprises a memory (23) for the intermediate storing of information.

<DESCRIPTION>
A SYSTEM FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION BY MICROWAVES AND A CαyiMUNICATION DEVICE TO BE USED IN SUCH A SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a system for c tmunication, that is transmission of information, by means of microwaves in at least one direction between at least one data carrier, a so-called transponder and a terminal, a so-called central unit. The invention also relates to a communication unit to be used in such a system.BACKGROUNDWhen moving objects short or long distances, that is commonly "object transportation" in its modern form there are demands for identification of the objects in question. These may be individual objects, pallets with objects, boxes or containers or other. The identification is important when considering efficiency or safety.There is therefore a need for a system for reading data frcm the objects present in object transportation. Usually, these data are required to be forwarded to some superior system or centre. In certain cases it is desired to refer information to the objects from this centre, for example with the purpose to limit the demands on the geographical covering of the centre.There are other areas, where there is a need to forward information from data carrying objects to a more or less distant centre, for example in connection with rental cars. Also human objects, that is persons, such as sportsmen on check-ups or persons for which safety check-ups are needed can be provided with data carriers, frcm which information can be transmitted to such a centre.Hitherto it has proven difficult to achieve efficient systems of this kind. One suggestion has implied that the objects in question were provided with an optic code, for example a bar code, which was read with a manually carried reading pistol that was connected to a radio transmitter for ccraπunication with the superior system, that is the centre. Quite extensive apparatus is required for the purpose, as separate media are used for communication with the object, or rather the data carrying device on it, and communication with the centre. In practice, different physical 

units must be used for the optic reading and radio transmission, respect¬ ively. It is difficult to get general frequency permission for radio transmission, since different radio bands are allowed in different count¬ ries. Furthermore, communication at radio frequency does not admit compact directed antennae, which leads to high demands on transmitted effect and problems with interferences between different equipment.Another proposed
