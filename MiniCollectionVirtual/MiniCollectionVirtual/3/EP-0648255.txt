<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating inorganic solid waste in a bath of molten metal contained in a vessel (3) which has a space above the bath and a waste gas outlet (11) is disclosed. The method comprises injecting waste into the bath to form a primary reaction zone (13) in which there are reactions between the waste and the bath or in which the waste undergoes a change of phase to convert the waste into more readily recoverable or disposable products. The method further comprises injecting oxygen-containing gas towards the surface of the bath to form a secondary reaction zone (17) in a section of the space above the bath through which oxidisable products released from the primary reaction zone (13) flow to reach the waste gas outlet (11) in the vessel (3) and in which the oxidisable products are oxidised and the heat released by such oxidation is transferred into the bath.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of
inorganic solid waste.In particular, the present invention relates to the
treatment of inorganic solid waste which is commonly
referred to as "dusts".The term "dusts" as used herein is understood to mean
any relatively finely divided particulate material and
includes but is not limited to:
(a) metallic or metallic oxide containing material
substantially collected by gas cleaning systems
operated, for example, as a component of pyrometallurgical
production and processing; and/or(b) inorganic residues arising from the combination
or incineration of toxic, hazardous and non-hazardous
wastes, including fly ash, bottom ash
and particulate material collected by gas
cleaning systems.In many instances, for a range of environmental and
materials handling reasons it is difficult and expensive to
dispose of dusts. For example, dusts often contain
hazardous compounds and require particular processing
before disposal. In addition, dusts often contain
components which, whilst valuable, cannot be recovered
economically. In the field of gas production a method is known from GB 2082624 wherein
gas is produced in a ferrous bath reactor containing an iron melt. The
method is carried out by feeding solid or liquid carbonaceous fuel (e.g. coal)
into the reactor and blowing an oxygen-containing gas from nozzles onto
the surface of the melt to gasify the fuels. The gas is collected in a space
through which the gas from the nozzles is blown. In traversing the gas space
the gas from the nozzles causes partial combustion of the generated gas so
that the combustion gases are transported to the melt surface whereby the
combustion heat is transmitted to the melt. In this document, however, no
means for avoiding volatilised species and particulate material to leave the
vessel are described.From DE 3608005 A1 a method for disposal of waste is known. In this
method the waste is pyrolyzed at a temperature of 500° - 900°C and the thus
produced pyrolysis gas is subsequently led through a hot liquid together
with an oxidation agent. With this method the pyrolysis gas is transformed
into a product gas mainly consisting of hydrogen and carbonmonoxide. In
order to work this method it is hence necessary to pyrolyze solid waste
before a separate treatment step of conducting the pyrolysis gas to a hot
liquid is carried out. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method of treating dusts which alleviates the disadvantages
described in the preceding paragraphs.According to the

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating inorganic solid waste in a
bath of molten metal in a vessel which has a space above

the bath and a waste gas outlet, the method comprising:

(a) injecting waste into the bath to form a primary
reaction zone in which there are reactions

between the waste and the bath or in which the
waste undergoes a change of phase to convert the

waste into more readily recoverable or disposable
products;
(b) injecting oxygen-containing gas towards the
surface of the bath to form a secondary reaction

zone in a section of the space above the bath
through which oxidisable products released from

the primary reaction zone flow to reach the waste
gas outlet and in which the oxidisable products

are oxidised and the heat released by such

oxidation is transferred into the bath; and
(c) injecting a gas into the bath to cause splashes and/or
droplets of molten metal to be ejected upwardly from the

bath into the secondary reaction zone or into a section of
the space above the bath which is between the secondary

reaction zone and the waste gas outlet to facilitate.
efficient heat transfer to the bath and scrubbing of

volatilised species and any particulate material in the
products released from the primary reaction zone and/or

formed in the secondary reaction zone.
The method defined in claim 1, further
comprising injecting carbonaceous material into the bath to

form a carburising zone in which the carbon in the
carbonaceous material dissolves into the bath and is

available for reaction with waste in the primary reaction
zone.

carbonaceous material is selected from one or more of the

group comprising coal, spent pot linings from aluminium
smelting furnaces, and sewage sludge.
The method defined in claim 3, wherein the
carbonaceous material comprises coal.
The method defined in any one of claims 2 to 4,
further comprising locating the carburising zone directly

below the secondary reaction zone.

comprises at least 70% metal.
The method defined in claim 7, wherein the bath
comprises at least 80% metal.

the group comprising iron, ferroalloys, nickel, tin,
chromium, silicon, and copper, and mixtures thereof.
The method defined in claim 1, wherein the gas 
injected into the bath to cause molten metal and slag

splashes and/or droplets to be ejected upwardly into the
secondary reaction zone is-selected from one or more of an

inert gas, recycled process gas, natural gas, CO

or butane, or mixtures of the gases.
The method defined in claim 10, wherein the inert
