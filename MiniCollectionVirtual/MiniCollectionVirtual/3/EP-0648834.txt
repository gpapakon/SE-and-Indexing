<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous cleaning composition for carpets, rugs, 
and textiles has been discovered with the composition 

comprising sodium lauryl sulfate, an ethylene glycol 
monohexyl ether, a fluorosurfactant, a carboxylated 

polymer salt, and a tetrasodium ethlyenediamine 
tetraacetate. The composition is effective in removing 

a variety of stains from carpeting and is particularly 
effective against oily stains without imparting 

undesirable properties on the cleaned surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cleaning compositions
particularly useful in removing stains from rugs,
carpets, and textiles.A wide variety of carpet cleaning and
anti-soiling compositions are available for
do-it-yourself carpet cleaning. Fluorochemical
compounds have been described in the prior art as
useful in treating textiles, such as carpets, to
impart oil and water repellency and soil resistance.
AU-B-0 042 875 describes aqueous carpet cleaning
compositions comprising a particular combination of
perfluoro polymers and a non-ionic, anionic or
amphoteric surfactant, at a pH of 4.0 to 9.5.
Although these compositions have found commercial
success, there is a continuing need for alternative
formulations offering an increased cleaning potential
for a variety of stains, particularly oily stains. In
formulating a new carpet cleaning composition, it is
particularly challenging to impart a new property into
an existing composition without destroying other
worthwhile properties of the composition.One problem encountered when carpet has been
treated with a cleaning composition is that frequently
the treated portion of the carpet becomes more
sensitive to resoiling than the untreated portions of
the carpet. Consequently, the resoiling of the
treated portion of the carpet occurs more quickly for
"cleaned" carpet as opposed to untreated carpet.
Another problem commonly associated with carpet
cleaning compositions is that the carpet is left with
a "sticky" residue such that the "softness" of the
carpet deteriorates after cleaning. Additionally, 
other undesirable properties include damage to the
carpet by spotting, colour loss or leaving an
undesirable residue.There remains a need for alternative cleaning
compositions useful in removing a variety of spots,
particularly oily type stains from carpet, and other
textiles, without imparting undesirable properties.The need discussed above has been alleviated with
the discovery of an aqueous cleaning composition having
a pH level falling with a range of from 4 to 9.5
comprising:
(a) from 0.75% to about 1.15% by weight of sodium
lauryl sulfate;(b) from 0.65% to about 0.85% by weight ethylene
glycol monohexyl ether;(c) from 0.025% to 0.1% by weight of a fluorinated
surfactant selected from a mixture of (i) a
perfluoropropionate of formula I
F(CF2)n-CH2CH2-S-CH2CH9-COOLi
wherein n is an integer having a value of 6 to 12;and
(ii) a perfluoroalkyl phosphate of formula II,
 
wherein n is an integer having a value of 6 to 12, and the
weight ratio of (i) to (ii) being from 1:1 to
