<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to extruders of the type which
employ single screws that use chaotic mixing to generate
substantially better distributive mixing. Such structures of this
type, generally, stretch and fold material lines repeatedly such
that interfacial areas between material elements increase
exponentially and heat/mass transfers are greatly enhanced.Single screw extruders are widely used in the
plastics industry as mixers and pumps. The simplest design
consists of a screw which rotates inside a close fitting cylindrical
barrel. The screw, typically, includes a feed section, a transition
section, and a metering section. Virtually all studies of single
screw extruders are based on the unwound representation of the
screw channel. The relative motion of the screw and the barrel
appears as a plate which moves diagonally on top of the channel
(see Figure 1) in the direction of arrow V.The fluid flow in the channel can be decomposed into
two components, namely, a cross flow in the x1-x2 plane and an
axial flow in the x3-direction. The axial flow pumps the materials
forward and the cross flow mixes them. However, the mixing in
such a conventional screw is poor.With respect to Figure 2, typically, a mixing section
such as a Maddock mixing section, a pin mixing section (see also
Figure 3d), a pineapple mixing section, a blister ring, and so on,
is added to the screw to increase its dispersive and/or distributive 
mixing capability. However, these mixing sections are relatively
short compared to the length of the screw. It is to be understood
that the arrows in Figure 3 indicate the location of the channel in
unit diameter from the shank.The screw section responsible for mixing is typically
characterized by its closeness to the outer barrel to generate the
high shear stress required for a dispersive mixing (e.g., Maddock
section and blister ring), or by a large number of small units
affixed on the root of the screw for a distributive mixing (e.g. pin
and pineapple mixing sections).A different kind of mixing screw, such as barrier
screws (see Figures 3a and 3b) is designed based on the solid-melt
distribution as it is conveyed down the metering section. The
barrier screw has two channels, used to separate melt from solid,
of varying width separated by an undercut barrier flight. The
width of the channel is proportional to the amount of solid or melt.
Initially, as pellets start to melt, the melt pool is pushed into the
narrow melt channel. The melt channel grows larger as more
melt is collected. The Barr ET

<CLAIMS>
A single screw extruder for generating chaotic mixing,
comprising:


a screw having a continuous flight and comprising a feed
section, a transition section and a metering section;
a plurality of baffles (6) attached to said screw such that baffles
are positioned on said screw in a predetermined periodic orientation in said

transition section and in said metering section; and
a cylindrical enclosure means which substantially surrounds said
screw and said baffles,

characterised in that said flight defines a channel having a
width (w) to depth (H) ration between 4 and 6.
The extruder of Claim 1, wherein the length (L
B
) of said baffles
is at least one-half of a revolution of said screw.
The extruder of Claim 1, wherein said predetermined periodic
orientation comprises said baffles being located in a centre-right-centre-left

baffle sequence with respect to an axial distance along said screw.
The extruder of Claim 1, wherein the height (H
B
) said baffles is
at least one-half of the depth (H) of said cavity.
The extruder of any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein said screw
further comprises a continuous secondary flight which is 180Â° off phase from

said continuous flight.
