<ABSTRACT>
An illumination unit according to the invention comprises an electrodeless 
low-pressure discharge lamp (20) and a supply device (50). The lamp has a discharge 

vessel (30) which encloses in a gastight manner a discharge space (31) which is 
provided with an ionizable filling. The lamp (20) further has a coil (40) provided with a 

winding (42) around a sintered core (41) of polycrystalline ferrite material, which 
winding (42) is connected to the supply device (50). The coil (40) is capable of inducing 

a high-frequency magnetic field which maintains a discharge in the discharge space 
(31). The losses in the core (41), when measured at room temperature in a magnetic 

field with a frequency of 3 MHz and a magnetic flux density of 10 mT, amount to at 
most 150 mW/cm³. This has the advantage that the lamp (20) ignites comparatively 

quickly and loads the supply device (50) comparatively weakly during ignition. The 
supply device (50) as a result can have a comparatively long useful life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an illumination unit comprising an electrodeless
low-pressure discharge lamp and a supply device, which lamp has a discharge vessel
enclosing in a gastight manner a discharge space provided with an ionizable filling, and
which lamp in addition has a coil provided with a winding around a sintered core of
polycrystalline ferrite material, which winding is connected to the supply device, the
coil being capable of inducing a high-frequency magnetic field which maintains a
discharge in the discharge space.The invention also relates to an electrodeless low-pressure discharge lamp
and to a coil adapted for the use in such an illumination unit.An illumination unit of the kind described in the opening paragraph is
known from US 4,710,678. In a nominal operating condition, the high-frequency
magnetic field caused by the coil generates an electric current in the discharge space
which keeps the discharge going. The known illumination unit is ignited in that a
resonant circuit, which includes the coil, is brought into resonance. A comparatively
high voltage arises across the coil during this. This voltage is used to generate an
electric field by means of one or several conductors adjacent the discharge vessel, for
example the winding of the coil, thus initiating the discharge. The losses occurring in
the illumination unit during nominal operation are mainly due to the thermal losses
occurring in the discharge space, as are the losses in a conventional low-pressure
discharge lamp in which the discharge is maintained by electrodes. These losses amount
to approximately 60% of the power consumed by the illumination unit. Losses specific
to the electrodeless lamp, i.e. the losses in the electric circuit and the losses in the coil,
are found to be small compared therewith, approximately 11 % and approximately 5%,
respectively, of the power consumed. The efficacy of the electrodeless lamp,
accordingly, is of the same order of magnitude as that of a conventional low-pressure
discharge lamp. Such an illumination unit has the advantage that the lamp can have a 
comparatively long operational life, because electrodes in the discharge space are
unnecessary.It was found, however, that the life of the illumination unit can be limited
by that of the supply device.The invention has for its object to provide a measure in an illumination
unit of the kind described in the opening paragraph which renders possible a longer life
of the supply device.According to the invention, the illumination unit is for this
