<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for 
improved speech comprehension in artificial translation 

of one language to a second language. The arrangement 
comprises an analysis unit which carries out an analysis 

of duration and fundamental tone of the speech in the 
first language. A prosody-interpreting unit determines, 

on the basis of the analysis and language-characteristic 
information, prosody-dependent information in the first 

speech which is used by a prosody-generating unit for the 
second language for controlling the speech synthesis. A 

speech synthesis element thus produces stresses in the 
speech translated in the second language which, from a 

language point of view, correspond to stresses in the 
first language.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for
increasing the comprehension of speech when translating
speech from a first language to a second language. The
invention is intended to be used in equipment which
artificially translates speech in one language into verbal
information in a second language. The aim of the invention
is to achieve an improvement in the possibilities of
creating a translation corresponding to the original
speech by means of artificial translation.Devices for speech synthesis and translation are
already known. EP 327 408 and US 4 852 170 relate to
systems for language translation. The systems comprise
speech recognition and speech synthesis. However, the
systems do not utilize prosody interpretation and prosody
generation.EP 0 095 139 and EP 0 139 419 describe speech
synthesis arrangements which utilize prosody information.
These documents, however, do not describe the utilization
of prosody information in language translation.One problem with the earlier technique is that it
does not take stresses into account in translating from
one language to another. The present invention solves the
problem by using prosody-interpreting and prosody-generating
units. The present invention thus provides an arrangement
for increasing the comprehension of speech when
translating speech from a first language to a second
language. The arrangement comprises elements for receiving
speech in a first language, a translation unit for
translating the speech in the first language to a second
language, and speech synthesis elements for generating
speech in the second language.According to the invention, the arrangement also
comprises an analysis unit which analyzes variations in
the fundamental tone and duration of the speech in the
first language, and a prosody-interpreting unit which
determines first prosody-dependent information in dependence
on the said analysis and on language-characteristic
information which relates to the first language. A
prosody-generating unit generates second prosody-dependent
information with starting point from the first
prosody-dependent information and from the language-characteristic
information which relates to the second
language. The second prosody-dependent information is
used by the speech synthesis element for producing
stresses in the second language corresponding to stresses
in the speech in the first language.Embodiments of the invention are specified in the
subsequent Patent Claims.The invention will now be described in detail
with reference to the attached drawing,

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for increasing the comprehension of
speech when translating speech from a first language to

a second language, comprising

elements for receiving speech in a first language,
a translation unit for translating speech in the

first language to a second language, and speech synthesis
elements for generating speech in the second language,

characterized in that the arrangement also comprises
an analysis unit which analyzes variations in the
fundamental tone and duration of the speech in the first

language,
a prosody-interpreting unit which determines
first prosody-dependent information in dependence on the

said analysis and on language-characteristic information
which relates to the first language,
a prosody-generating unit which generates second
prosody-dependent information with a starting point from

the first prosody-dependent information and from
language-characteristic information which relates to the

second language, which second prosody-dependent information
is used by the speech synthesis element for producing

stresses in the second language corresponding to
stresses in the speech in the first language.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the receiving element comprises a speech recognition

element which converts the first speech into text,
the translation unit translating text in the first

language into text in the second language, and in that
the speech synthesis element comprises a text-to-speech

converting element.
