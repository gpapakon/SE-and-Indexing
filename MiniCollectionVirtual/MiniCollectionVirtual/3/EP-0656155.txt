<ABSTRACT>
A multi-stage fibre amplifier includes attenuators located between co-pumped and counter-pumped stages. The attenuators prevent transmission of pump energy between the stages and the transmission of signal energy from later to earlier stages. The attenuators substantially separate the various stages whereby unwanted interaction is substantially reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-stage fibre amplifiers which are used
to amplify optical signals by means of laser action which occurs in the
core of the fibre.It has long been recognised that fibre amplifiers are an attractive
altemative for amplifying optical signals. For example fibre amplifiers
have been proposed for use as booster amplifiers to increase the output
power from a telecommunications optical transmitter or at a
telecommunications repeater to amplify optical signals which have been
attenuated by transmission through a first telecommunications link in
order that said signal has sufficient power for onward transmission
through a second telecommunications link. A fibre amplifier comprises a
lasing species, e.g. a rare earth such as praseodymium (Pr), neodymium
(Nd) or erbium (Er), which is located in the core of a fibre waveguide.
The fibre is connected, usually by means of a wavelength division
multiplexer (WDM), to a pump which is adapted to provide pump
radiation which interacts with the lasing species to produce the inversion
which is needed to support lasing activity. In some embodiments the
WDM is connected at the input end of the fibre whereas other
embodiments connect the WDM at the output end; i.e. both
configurations are known.The gain available from a single stage amplifier, i.e. as described
above, is limited. This limitation is due to a variety of technical features
and two important contributors will be identified. In the first place, the
power available from a single pump is limited and this limits the lasing
activity so that only limited gain can be achieved. In addition, it is
difficult to stimulate a sufficient quantity of the lasing species if all the
pump radiation is derived from a single source. It has been recognised, at
least theoretically, that these limitations could be overcome by the use of
a plurality of pumps each of which stimulates a different region of the
lasing species. This configuration can be regarded as a plurality of fibre
amplifier stages connected in series whereby the output of one amplifier
stage forms the input to the next amplifier stage. It will be appreciated
that a multi-stage amplifier makes the limitations mentioned above less 
restrictive on the composite structure. Because there is a plurality of pumps the
total power is not limited by the performance of any one of the pumps.
Furthermore each pump is only required to stimulate a portion of the lasing species
so the problems of distributions are made less onerous.Many embodiments employ

<CLAIMS>
A multi-stage optical amplifier comprising a plurality of fibre amplifier
stages including at least one co-pumped stage (10) and one counter-pumped

stage, (11) each of which includes means (13,16) for providing
pump radiation into each of said stages (10,11) so as to support laser

amplification therein, the stages (10,11) being connected in series for the
sequential amplification of optical signals provided to the first stage (10),

characterised in that the multi-stage amplifier includes an inter-stage
optical attenuator (21) located only between the or each pair of adjacent co-pumped and counter-pumped amplifier

stages (10,11) wherein the or each inter-stage attenuator (21) is adapted
to highly attenuate signals at pump wavelength propagated in either

direction and also to attenuate signals at signal wavelength propagated in
the direction from the output to the input but causing only low attenuation

to optical signals at signal wavelength transmitted from the input to the
output.
An optical amplifier according to claim 1, which amplifier comprises a

inter-stage attenuator (21) located between the first (10) and second (11)
stages.
An optical amplifier according the claim 2, wherein one of the said two
pumps (13), is connected by a wavelength division multiplexer (18) to the

input of said first stage (10) and the other (16) of said two pumps is 
connected via a wavelength division multiplexer (18) to the output of said

second stage.
An optical amplifier according to claim 2, wherein said two pumps
(13,16) are connected to the two inputs of a coupler (30) having two

outputs one of which is connected to the input of said first stage (10) and
the other of which is connected to the output of said second stage (11)

from the other(16).
