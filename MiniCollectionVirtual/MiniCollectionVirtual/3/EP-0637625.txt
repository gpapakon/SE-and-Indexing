<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to fabric softening 
compositions of insoluble, degradable cationic fabric 

softeners at high concentrations. In particular, the present 
invention addresses the problem of dispersability which is 

usually associated with concentrations of bio-degradable 
cationic fabric softeners above 30%. 
Including a mixture of aromatic acids, especially 
benzoic acid and salicylic acid, at an amount of at least 

10% in total has proven to eliminate the dispersability 
drawbacks and stabilize the high concentration of the fabric 

softener active.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fabric softening 
compositions of insoluble, degradable cationic fabric 
softeners at high concentrations. In particular, the present 
invention addresses the problem of dispersability which is 
usually associated with concentrations of bio-degradable 
cationic fabric softeners above 30%. Including a mixture of aromatic acids, especially benzoic 
acid and salicylic acid, at an amount of at least 10% 
in total has proven to eliminate the dispersability drawbacks 
and stabilize the high concentration of the fabric 
softener active.  Traditionally, high concentrations of fabric softener 
actives which have been described in the prior art and are 
available for consumers are not readily dilutable such that 
they cannot be used directly. In order to use them effectively 
in the dispenser of automatic washing machines they 
have to be pre-diluted with water under strong agitation. 
This step is seen more often than not to be unacceptable, 
leading to an upper limit of fabric softener active 
concentrations in order to simplify or eliminate this step. Typically, the commercially available fabric softener 
active concentrations comprise less than 25% active. At 
concentrations above this the cationic fabric softener active 
would not easily dilute such that its direct use in the 
dispenser of automatic washing machines is not possible. A possible, and, for those skilled in the art obvious 
solution to this problem of desired higher concentration and 
acceptable dispensing performance, would be to include high 
amounts of organic solvents allowing the fabric softener active 
at concentrations even up to 50% to be easily dispersable. 
However, high amounts (i.e. more than 10% to 20%) 
of organic solvents in household chemicals have safety 
(flash point)environmental and severe regulatory drawbacks 
(in some countries) and are therefore questionable in a 
household chemical. The problem of dispersing and stability of the composition 
is further aggravated when fabric softeners containing 
at least one ester link to improve their bio-degradability 
are introduced. Therefore, the problem underlying the present invention 
is to provide bio-degradable cationic fabric softeners at 
concentrations of at least 30% without the use of high 
amounts (more than 10 to 20%) of organic solvents and having 
a desirable i.e. sufficiantly complete dispersing from the  
 
dispersing compartment of typical automatic washing 
machines. EP-A-40562 discloses concentrated quaternary ammonium 
compounds
