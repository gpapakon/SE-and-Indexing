<ABSTRACT>
A conductive connector for a switchgear with a 
plurality of cubicles. The conductive connector includes a 

lower bushing and an upper bushing. The lower bushing 
includes a T-shaped insulating layer having a head provided 

with a first semi-tubular groove in a direction orthogonal 
to a central axis thereof, a central conductor buried in the 

T-shaped insulating layer along the central axis, and a 
lower electrode in the form of a semi-tube, positioned in 

the first semi-tubular groove of the head of the T-shaped 
insulating layer in a direction orthogonal to the central 

conductor and electrically connected to the central 
conductor. The upper bushing is provided facing the head of 

the lower bushing, has a bottom provided with a second semi-tubular 
groove in the direction orthogonal to the central 

axis to form a through hole together with the T-shaped 
insulating layer. The conductive connector further includes 

a presser electrode in the form of the semi-tube, positioned 
in the second semi-tubular groove of the bottom of the upper 

bushing and provided facing the lower electrode to form a 
tubular electrode together with the lower electrode, and 

tightening members for pressing the upper bushing and the 
presser electrode on to a facing surface of the lower 

bushing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conductive connectors
for electrical switchgear which, for instance, make cable
connections between the cubicles of a metal closed type
switchgear in which insulating gas is sealed.Figure 16 of the accompanying drawings is a
perspective view showing prior art switchgear conductive
connectors 21 penetrating the top ceiling plates of cubicles
1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H and 1J, which comprise power
distribution facility 100, and are connected by cables 2.
Figure 17 is an enlarged vertical cross-section which shows
the conductive connectors 21 on the top plates of cubicles
1B, 1D and 1E. Figure 18 shows a partial detailed
enlargement of Figure 17.In Figures 16, 17 and 18, T-shaped bushings 23A,
23B and 23C, disclosed in EP-0148394(B1), penetrate the top
plates of cubicles 1B, 1D and 1E respectively. They are
hermetically secured via O-rings (not illustrated) which are
fitted to the top plates. T-shaped bushings identical T-shaped
bushings 23A, 23B and 23C also vertically penetrate
the top plates of other cubicles 1A, 1C, 1F, 1G, 1H and 1J 
as shown in Figure 16.In these T-shaped bushings 23A, 23B and 23C,
roughly T-shaped insulating layers 24, which are injection-moulded
in epoxy resin, are formed on the outer peripheries
of roughly T-shaped central conductors 25. Through-holes
23b which penetrate from left to right in Figure 17 are
formed in the portions (hereafter, "heads") 23a which
project above the top of cubicles 1B, 1D and 1E. Earthing
layers 23c are formed on the outer peripheries of heads 23a.In Figures 17 and 18, cylindrical contact pieces
28 are fitted round the ends of core wires 2a of cables 2.
These are secured by wedges 28b inserted into the ends of
core wires 2a. Grooves are formed in the outer peripheries
of contact pieces 28 and ring-shaped contact plates 28a,
made of conductive spring material are fitted in these
grooves.At the two ends of cables 2, roughly cylindrical
stress-cones 6 are inserted on inner sheaths 2b from which
outer sheaths 2c have been removed. These cones 6 are
inserted in 
through-holes 23b of heads 23a on cubicles 1D and 1E shown
in Figure 17, and are pressed inward by presser pieces (not
illustrated).In conductive connectors with this type of
construction, when, for instance, making connection with
cable 2 between T-shaped bushings 23B and 23C which
penetrate the ceiling plates of cubicles 1D and 1E shown in
Figure 17, first, cable 2 to which contact pieces 28 and
stress cones 6 are not yet fitted is inserted from the left
side of
