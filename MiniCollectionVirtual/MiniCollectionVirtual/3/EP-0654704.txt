<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating 
compositions for applying antistatic layers to a 
support and to photographic imaging elements comprising 
an imaging layer and a support material containing an 
antistatic layer comprising vanadium pentoxide in a 
binder. The invention is applicable to conventional 
photographic imaging elements as well as thermally 
processable imaging elements including thermographic 
and photothermographic imaging elements. The problem of controlling static charge is 
well known. Static charging may occur due to various 
factors in the manufacture, finishing, and use of 
imaging elements, especially, photographic elements. 
The accumulation of static charges can result in fog 
patterns in photographic emulsions, various coating 
imperfections such as mottle patterns and repellency 
spots, dirt and dust attraction which may result in the 
formation of "pinholes" in processed films, and a 
variety of handling and conveyance problems. To overcome the problem of accumulation of 
static charges, it is conventional practice to provide 
an antistatic layer in photographic elements. Many 
antistatic agents have been utilized for this purpose. It is known to prepare an antistatic layer 
from a composition comprising a vanadium pentoxide 
colloidal gel as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,203,769 issued May 20, 1980, U.S. Patent No. 
5,006,451 issued April 9, 1991, and U.S. Patent No. 
5,221,598 issued June 22, 1993. Antistatic layers  
 
containing vanadium pentoxide provide excellent 
protection against static and are highly advantageous 
in that they have excellent transparency and their 
performance is not significantly dependent on humidity. 
The excellent performance of these antistatic layers 
results from the particular morphology of this 
material. The colloidal vanadium pentoxide gel 
consists of entangled, high aspect ratio, flat ribbons 
about 50-100 angstroms wide, about 10 angstroms thick 
and about 1000-10000 angstroms long. Low surface 
resistivities can be obtained with very low vanadium 
pentoxide coverages as a result of this high aspect 
ratio morphology. Typically, the vanadium pentoxide is coated 
in a polymeric binder to improve adhesion to adjacent 
layers and to improve the durability of the antistatic 
layer. Several polymer binders have been disclosed in 
the above-mentioned U.S. Patents, for example, 
interpolymers of vinylidene chloride for aqueous-based 
antistat coating formulations. As a result of the very 
low coverages required, the antistat
