<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid the assembly of a brake caliper (1) of a fixed caliper disc brake for motor vehicles with a brake disc (14) unsuitable for the brake caliper (1) when mounting it on the vehicle wheel, the rim of a brake disk (2) suitable for the brake caliper (1) is provided with an encircling annular groove (11) which is open radially towards the outside and into which a projection (13, 18) formed on the brake caliper (1) projects radially from the outside inwards without touching the brake disc (2).

Fixed-type caliper disc brake for automotive vehicles 
including a brake caliper (1) which is rigidly fixed to the 

steering knuckle of the vehicle and straddles the external 
edge of a brake disc (2), and the bridge portion (3, 4) of 

the brake caliper (1) projecting beyond the edge of the 
brake disc has at least one projection (13, 18) which 

extends radially inwardly into an annular groove (11) 
provided at the edge of the brake disc (2) without touching 

the brake disc (2), the said annular groove being open in a 
radially outward direction,
characterized
 in that a key-type engagement is 
constituted between the projection (13, 18) on the bridge 

portion (3, 4) and the annular groove (11) in the brake disc 
(2), and the types of the annular groove (11) and the 

projection (13, 18) are specifically conformed to each other 
such that exclusively mating brake calipers (1) and brake 

discs (2) can be combined with each other. 
Disc brake as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the axial position of the 
annular groove (11 and 15, respectively) in the edge of the 

brake disc (2 and 14, respectively) and the axial position 
of the projection (13, 18) conformed thereto is determined 

in dependence on the axial dimension of the brake disc (2 
and 14, respectively). 
Disc brake as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the radial projection  
 

(13) is integrally designed with, and preferably cast with, 
the bridge portion (3) of the brake caliper (1). 
Disc brake as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the radial projection 
(18) is configured as a pin (17) which is attached in a bore 

(16) in the bridge portion (3') of the brake caliper (1).
