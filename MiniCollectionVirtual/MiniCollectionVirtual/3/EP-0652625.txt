<ABSTRACT>
An electrical drive having a brake, in particular for hoists, lifting devices or positioning conveyor systems, has a brake disc (16) which moves axially on the motor shaft (1), rotates with the motor shaft (1) by means of a tooth system (1b) and has braking surfaces (16a, 16b) on both sides which can be pressed by spring force against a stationary opposing brake disc (17), and has an electromagnetic device which releases the brake, against the spring force, when current passes through it. In order to achieve shorter time constants for the braking process it is proposed that the electromagnetic device consist of AC magnets (24), that E-shaped magnet coil yokes (27) be provided and that the opposing pole surfaces (28) be arranged on magnet yokes (29) whose angle can move in all directions and which can be aligned on the end surfaces (30) of the E-shaped magnet coil yokes (27), which are arranged opposite, when current passes through the AC magnets (24).

Electric drive with brake, in particular for hoists, lifting devices or positioning
conveyors, having a brake disc axially movable on the motor shaft and rotatable

with the motor shaft by splining with bilateral braking surfaces, which splining is
pressable by spring pressure against stationary counter-braking discs and

comprising an electromagnetic device consisting of AC magnets, which when
supplied with power effects lifting of the brake against spring pressure and in

which opposite-pole faces are disposed on magnet yokes, which are capable of
angular displacement on all sides
 and which, when power is supplied to the AC
magnets, are capable of being aligned with the end faces of the opposite

magnetic coil yokes, characterised in that power is supplied as single-phase
alternating current and two separate E-shaped magnetic coil yokes (27) are

provided with a common coil (23) disposed on either side of the motor shaft (1)
and with short-circuiting rings on the pole faces of the magnetic coil yokes (27).
Electric drive according to claim 1, characterised in that the E-shaped magnet
yokes (29) are fixed resiliently all round on an anchoring plate (17a), which forms

a stationary counter-braking disc (17).
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the magnet
yokes (29) on the housing are underlaid by a resilient element (31).
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the two E-shaped
magnet yokes (29) are held by tiltable bolts (33) which are fixed with stay

bolts (32) and which are each inserted in recesses (29a) in the magnet yokes (29)
corresponding to the bolt cross-section, the magnet yokes (29) bearing via

resilient elements (31) on the side (17c) of the anchoring plate (17a) remote from
the braking surface (17b). 
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the winding
(23) extending around the two magnetic coil yokes (27) is surrounded by a

plastics housing (34), which in its interior (34a) forms guide shafts (35) for the E-shaped
magnetic coil yokes (27).
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that between the
anchoring plate (17a) and an annular shoulder (8b) of the brake housing (8) an

annular sleeve (36) is provided, which resiliently absorbs the axial motion of the
anchoring plate (17a).
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the braking
disc carrying bilateral brake linings (16a, 16b) has a moulded-on plastics hub

(15), which is provided in the guide bore (15a) With splining (1b) permitting axial
displacement.
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the magnet
yokes (29) are underlaid by a prestressed spring element (31).
Electric drive according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the guide
pins (18) are extended outwards through the hollow rivets (21).
