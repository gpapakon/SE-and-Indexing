granular detergent composition containing a percarbonate 

bleaching agent with a packaging system containing said 
composition, characterized in that said composition has a 

Equilibrium Relative Humidity below 30% at 35째C, and that the 

packaging system contains at least one unit having a Moisture 
Vapour Transfer Rate of from 1g/m2/day to less than 20g/m2/day.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions
containing percarbonate bleach; it provides a combination
between such compositions and a packaging system containing
them, such combination yielding optimum bleach stability.The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely used in laundry
detergent compositions is sodium perborate in the form of either
the monohydrate or tetrahydrate. However, an increasing
interest in other perhydrate salts is being observed, of which
sodium percarbonate is the most readily available.Detergent compositions containing sodium percarbonate are
known in the art. Sodium percarbonate is an attractive
perhydrate for use in detergent compositions because it
dissolves readily in water, is weight efficient and, after 
giving up its available oxygen, provides a useful source of
carbonate ions for detergency purposes.The inclusion of percarbonate salts in laundry detergent
compositions has been restricted hitherto by the relative
instability of the bleach. In particular, percarbonate
salts decompose rapidly when stored in a moist and/or warm
atmosphere. It is known that acceptable storage
characteristics may however be obtained through the
protection of the carbonate by coating the crystalline
product, or by the inclusion of stabilizing agents during
its manufacture, or both. A variety of suitable coating
agents have been proposed including silicates and mixtures
of inorganic sulphate and carbonate salts. WO-92/06163
provides a detergent composition comprising a percarbonate
bleach, whereby the bleach displays an acceptable storage
stability. The acceptable storage stability of the bleach
is achieved by '163 by a specific formulation and
processing of certain products of higher ingredient
activity.There is still, however, the need to improve storage
stability of the percarbonate bleach, to achieve this in
all types of detergent compositions, including compositions
made by the various making processes now available.The problem of the influence of free moisture level on
percarbonate stability has been addressed in EPA503 221 by
specifying to keep the level of Equilibrium Relative
Humidity under 30% at 32째C; it was found however that,
while the moisture level can relatively be well controlled
upon making of the detergent composition, it is quite
difficult to control its evolution during storage, where
moisture is almost inevitably picked up.It has also been found that packaging such percarbonate-containing
compositions in water-proof materials does not
provide an acceptable solution
