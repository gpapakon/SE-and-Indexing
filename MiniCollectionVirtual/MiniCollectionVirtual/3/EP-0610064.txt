<ABSTRACT>
A switching circuit for an FET transistor includes a 
controlled current circuit coupled to the gate of the FET. 

The input (36) to the controlled current circuit represents a 
desired rate of change of gate voltage of the FET and is 

generated by a circuit responsive to the average specific 
transconductance of two FETs (41,42) of similar specific 

transconductance operating at different drain current 
densities. Circuitry (51,52) is responsive to different gate 

voltages of the transistors (41,42) at the respective drain 
current densities to operate the signal (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to transistor switching and is 
particularly applicable to FET transistors used in output 
drivers for an integrated circuit device and to methods of 
operating FET transistors which may be used in such circuit 
devices. The invention is also applicable to detection of 
transconductance of such transistors and to controlling 
switching rates of such transistors in dependence on 
transconductance detection methods and circuits. Integrated circuit devices are commonly used to generate 
output signals which are supplied from an output terminal or 
pad to a load circuit on a connected printed circuit board. 
The high speed transmission of signals from an output pad of 
an IC chip to a load on a printed circuit board provides 
problems. Each time a signal is driven off the chip, the 
external load capacitance must be discharged or charged via 
the output driver circuitry and the inductance of the voltage 
supply lines. The inductance may be due to conventional 
features such as bond wires and lead frame. The capacitance 
which has to be driven by the driver circuitry may be formed 
from a mixture of printed circuit board track capacitance, 
load capacitance of the device on the printed circuit board 
and other integrated circuit input or output capacitance. 
When an integrated circuit device is connected to a load on a 
printed circuit board the ground and power supply lines on the 
integrated circuit chip as well as the output pad connected to 
the load circuit on the printed circuit board will each be 
connected to circuits including inductance and capacitance 
such that resonance occurs when transmitting output signals 
from the output pad. Oscillations in voltage caused in this 
way may cause temporary rise and fall in the voltage on the on 
chip ground and supply lines herein referred to as supply 
bounce. Such supply bounce has undesirable effects such as 
the injection of noise into sensitive analog circuits. The  
 
speed of switching of transistors in the output driver circuit 
will vary from chip to chip because of variations in the 
integrated circuit processing during manufacture and also due 
to variations in operating temperature. The supply bounce 
will be greatest if the particular chip has fast transistors 
whereas the signal propagation delay will be greatest if the 
chip has slow transistors. The design of output driver 
circuits is therefore a compromise between the speed of the 
output driver circuits and the acceptable level of on chip 
supply bounce. The supply
