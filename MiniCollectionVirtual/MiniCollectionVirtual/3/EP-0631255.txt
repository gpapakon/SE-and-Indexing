<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement
of a printed letter inspecting apparatus which is to be
used for inspecting printed letters of solid objects such
as medicine tablets and medicine capsules.FIG.16 is an explanatory drawing of an
inspection process of a conventional printed letter
inspecting apparatus for solid objects.In this inspection process, the solid objects,
for instance medicine tablets, are aligned and carried in
a horizontal direction on a belt conveyer (not shown) and
pass under a two-dimensional camera 60 such as a CCD
camera. Generally plural, for example, four solid objects
are disposed in widthwise rows, namely in a direction
perpendicular to the carrying direction of the carrier, in
each other parallel rows.As shown in FIG.16, firstly, a surface of the
solid object is scanned by the two-dimensional camera 60
which issues an analog signal showing reflectance on the
surface of the solid object. The above-mentioned analog
signal is inputted in an analog/digital conversion circuit 
3 (hereinafter referred to as the A/D conversion circuit
3). The A/D conversion circuit 3 converts the analog
signal given from the two-dimensional camera 60 into an 8-bit
digital signal (hereinafter referred to as the digital
signal), in which the reflectance is divided into 256
levels. The digital signal successively issues from the
A/D conversion circuit 3 to a memory circuit 50. The
memory circuit 50 stores the digital signals given from
the A/D conversion circuit 3 at every predetermined range
data of the digital signals, for example, data of the
digital signals corresponding to one solid object.Then, every the predetermined range data of the
digital signals are issued from the memory circuit 50 to a
computer 120. The computer 120 performs a count process
51 at every predetermined range data of the digital
signals.The following three processes (a), (b) and (c)
are conducted in the count process 51 of the computer 120
in order to improve the accuracy of inspection:
(a) The digital signal is compared with a
predetermined value in turn, and the number of the digital
signal exceeding the predetermined value is counted.(b) Two digital signals, which are successively
issued in a scanning direction of the two-dimensional
camera 60, are compared with each other in turn. When an
absolute value of a difference between the two digital 
signals is greater than another predetermined value,
a signal is issued, and the number of the signal is
counted.(c) Two digital signals, which are generated in
successive
