<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hot-melt adhesive preparation, containing 25 to 99.5 wt. % of a thermoplastic polymer with a melting range between 40
<
o
>
C and 250
<
o
>
C, 0 to 40 wt. % of a resin for reinforcing the adhesive force of the preparation, 0 to 40 wt. % of a wax for regulating the viscosity of the preparation and 0 to 5 wt. % of additives usually used in hot-melt adhesives. According to the invention, 0.1 to 5 wt. % of a tenside is added to prevent the preparation from decomposing in dispensing and applying equipment.

A hotmelt adhesive preparation containing

25 to 99.5% by weight of a thermoplastic polymer with a melting range
of 40 to 250Â°C,
0 to 40% by weight of a resin for increasing bond strength,
0 to 40% of a wax for adjusting viscosity,
0 to 5% by weight of additives typical of hotmelt adhesives,
0.1 to 5% by weight of cationic surfactants,
characterized in that
 fatty acid esters of quaternary ammonium salts
("esterquats") are present as the cationic surfactants.
A hotmelt adhesive preparation as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) is present as the
polymer.
A hotmelt adhesive preparation as claimed in claim 1 or 2 consisting
of


25 to 35% by weight of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer,
20 to 40% by weight of a resin for increasing bond strength,
20 to 40% by weight of a wax for adjusting viscosity,
0.1 to 5% by weight of a surfactant and
up to 5% by weight of additives typical of hotmelt adhesives.
Hotmelt adhesive preparations as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 an ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymer, a polyester, a
polyvinyl but
yral and/or a polyisobutylene is/are used as the polymer.
A process for the production of the hotmelt adhesives claimed in
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the molten adhesive is combined with a
melt or a solution of the surfactant and, if desired, any solvent present is

then distilled off.
The use of surfactants for avoiding caking of hotmelt adhesives on
heated surfaces of equipment for applying or storing such adhesives.
