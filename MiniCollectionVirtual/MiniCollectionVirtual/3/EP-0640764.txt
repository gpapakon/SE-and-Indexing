<ABSTRACT>
The piston compressor comprises at least one cylinder (11) and a piston (10) which is guided therein in a non-contact manner and which is linked to a crosshead (6) via a piston rod (8). The piston rod consists of a tube (8) which extends between the crosshead (6) and the piston (10). In the tube there extends a tension rod (9) which can be extended by means of a hydraulic tensioning appliance (30) and which pulls, under pretension, the crosshead and the piston against the tube.

<CLAIMS>
A piston compressor having at least one cylinder and a 
piston guided therein in contact-free manner, which is 

connected via a piston rod to a crosshead,
characterised in that
 the piston rod consists of a pipe 
extending between the crosshead and the piston, 


and in that
 in this pipe an extensible tension rod is 
disposed, which under mechanical bias pulls the crosshead 

and the piston in a tensioned manner towards the pipe. 
A compressor according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 at one end the tension rod 
comprises a threaded portion screwed into the crosshead 

and at its other end comprises a threaded portion onto 
which a nut supported on the piston is screwed and which 

is can also be connected to a hydraulic clamping device. 
A compressor according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the piston is disposed in a 
cylinder having a horizontal axis.
