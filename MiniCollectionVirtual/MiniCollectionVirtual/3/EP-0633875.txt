<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an efficient method for the production of N-acyl amino alcohols via the selective acylation of the free amines of amino alcohols by reacting an organic acid or a salt thereof with an alkyl sulfonyl chloride or an alkyl phenyl sulfonyl chloride, in an organic solvent and in the presence of an organic base, to form the corresponding mixed anhydride, followed by reacting the mixed anhydride with an amino alcohol or a salt thereof to form the corresponding N-acyl amino alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the production of 
N-acyl amino alcohols via the selective acylation of the 
amino group of amino alcohols. The efficient, selective synthesis of reaction 
products wherein only one of multiple functional groups in a 
starting material is reacted remains a continuing challenge 
in organic chemistry. One such example is the selective 
acylation of the amino group of amino alcohols. N-acylated amino alcohols are especially important 
since among these compounds sphingolipids, particularly 
ceramides and derivatives thereof such as cerebrosides, 
gangliosides and sphingomyelins are of commercial and 
therapeutic importance. Ceramides, for example, are of great 
commercial potential in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals such 
as hair and skin care products (Zysman, A. et al. (1991) 
European Patent Application Publication No. 0 420 722 A2). Ceramides are a class of polar lipids endogenous to 
the epidermis. Ceramides play a major role in the water-retaining 
properties of the epidermis. It has been found 
that topical applications of ceramide- and pseudoceramide-containing 
compositions are effective in restoring the water 
content of dry skin and may be effective in relieving atopic 
eczema (Kerscher, M. et al. (1991) Eur. J. Dermatol., 1, 39-43; 
Imokawa, G. et al. (1989) J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 40, 
273-285). Sphingolipids have been found to exhibit therapeutic 
properties such as wound and ulcer healing through the 
promotion of cell restoration and growth (Tschannen, R. et 
al. (1985) European Patent Application Publication No. 0 146 
810 A2). In current practice, sphingolipids, especially 
ceramides, are primarily obtained via extraction and  
 
isolation from animal tissues, usually from bovine brain or 
porcine epidermal tissue. These extracts are primarily 
comprised of glycoceramides and generally contain only a few 
percent ceramides. Obviously, using this method, the 
production of ceramides is rather costly on an industrial 
scale. It would thus be desirable to find an alternative 
cost-efficient, high yield method for obtaining these 
valuable products. Chemical synthesis methods may provide a suitable 
alternative. Sphingolipids, as mentioned above, are 
characterized by a fatty N-acyl moiety. The acylation of 
amines may be achieved via a number of methods known in the 
art. Among these methods, Heymes, R. et al. ((1983) European 
Patent No. 0 023 453 B1) described a method for the 
acylation of the 7-amino group of cephalosporins via the 
formation of a mixed
