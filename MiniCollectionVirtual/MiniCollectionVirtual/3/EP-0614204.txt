<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switch dome (3) made of a synthetic extruded compound or the like, which is used as an operating device and resetting element for a push-button switch (1). The switch dome has a base cap (4), a cover (7) which is narrower than the base cap, and a flexible, thin-walled diaphragm (10) which connects the cover to the base cap. A contact surface (9) for bridging stationary contacts (11', 11'') is fitted to the cover on its surface facing the base cap or to the base cap on its surface facing the cover. The linear movement for operating the switch dome is effected by the cover in the direction (24) of the base cap, or by the base cap in the direction of the cover. On the surface facing away from the base cap, the cover has an attachment (14', 14'') which is designed to be sprung in the direction of the linear movement, or the base cap has such an attachment (14', 14'') on the surface facing away from the cover.

Switch cap (3) consisting of an injected synthetic
material or the like as the actuating member and restoring

element for a push button switch (1), which comprises a base
socket (4), a cover (7) which is narrower in comparison with the

base socket (4) and a flexible, thin-walled membrane (10)
connecting the base socket (4) and the cover (7), the cover (7)

being located by its end face on a support part, such as a
printed circuit board (6), on its surface facing the cover (7)

the base socket (4) comprising a contact surface (9) for bridging

fixed contacts (11', 11'') located on the support part and the
stroke movement for actuating the switch cap (3) taking place due

to the base socket (4) able to be acted upon by an actuating
force and which is wider in comparison with the cover (7), in the

direction of the cover (7),

in which case on the surface remote from the cover (7), the
base socket (4) comprises a projection (12),
which is designed to be resilient in the direction (24) of
the stroke movement,
the projection (12) having a lower spring force than that
which is caused by the elasticity of the membrane (10),
and in which case in the unactuated state of the push
button switch (1), only a deformation of the projection

(12) takes place.
Switch cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
recess (13) is located in the projection (12).
Switch cap according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
cross-section of the recess (13) is triangular.
Switch cap according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
cross-section of the recess (13) is trapezoidal.
Switch cap according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the projection (12) is injected in one 

piece on the base socket (4).
Switch cap according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the projection (12) is constructed in the

form of a circular ring.
Switch cap according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
recess (13) is constructed continuously in the form of a circular

ring.
Switch cap according to Claims 6 and 7, characterised in
that the projection (12) has approximately the shape of a cup

spring.
Switch cap according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the projection consists of individual, noncontinuous

segments (14, 14', 14").
Switch cap according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the switch cap (3) consists of a

thermoplastic elastomer.
Switch cap according to Claim 10, characterised in that
the thermoplastic elastomer is a block copolymer of a hard

crystalline segment of polybutylene terephthalate and a soft
amorphous segment based on long-chain polyether glycols.
Switch cap according to one of Claims 1 to 11 for
location on a support part, such as a printed circuit board (6),

characterised in that located on the cover (7) on the surface
remote from the base socket (4) is a fastening part (30), which

is constructed so that it can be inserted in a locking manner in
a recess (31) in the support part, preferably constructed as a

continuous bore in the support part, the fastening part (30)
preferably fitting in a form-locking manner in the recess (31)

and being located centrally on the cover (7). 
Switch cap according to Claim 12, characterised in that
the fastening part (30) is constructed as a pin, which has a

shaft (32) with a preferably round cross-section and a head (33)
located on the side opposite the cover (7), in which case the

shaft (32) is adapted as regards its cross-section to the recess
(31), whereas the head (33) has a larger cross-section than the

recess (31) and that the pin in particular is constructed as a
separate part with a fastening stud (35), in that the pin is

inserted in an opening (36) in the cover (7) from the side facing
the base socket (4) so that the pin is held fast on the cover (7)

by the fastening stud (35).
Switch cap according to Claim 12 or 13, characterised in
that the fastening part (30) has a resilient construction, in

that the shaft (32) is provided with a slot (37).
Switch cap according to Claims 12, 13 or 14,
characterised in that the fastening part (30) consists of hard

synthetic material, such as polycarbonate, polyamide, polyacetal,
polyester, polybutylene terephthalate or the like or of metal.
Method for the manufacture of a switch cap according to
Claims 12, 13, 14 or 15, characterised in that the fastening part

(30) is produced by the injection moulding method with a conveyor
belt (38) preferably comprising conveying holes (41) at regular

intervals, the same spacing (d) existing between respectively two
fastening parts (30) located on the conveyor belt (38), and at

a further processing station the switch caps (3) being mounted
on the fastening parts (30) or the fastening parts (30) being

injection moulded with a switch cap (3).
Method according to Claim 16, characterised in that at
the time of manufacture of the fastening part (30), a retaining

part (39) is injected between the fastening stud (35) and the
conveyor belt (38), a predetermined breaking point (40) being

located at the transition point between the fastening stud (35)
and the retaining part (39).
