<ABSTRACT>
A method for examining object structures in an electron beam apparatus 
utilizes two mutually coherent electron beams to produce standing-wave illumination of 

an object. The two beams form an interference pattern in or near the surface of an 
object to be examined. The direction and line pattern pitch of this interference pattern 

can be adapted to the crystal structure of the object and the phase and amplitude 
information of said structure can be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for examining object structures in a 
electron beam apparatus by means of two mutually coherent electron beams. The 
invention also relates to a electron beam apparatus for carrying out such a method. Document EP 472 235 discloses a method which utilizes focus variation 
reconstruction to observe the phase and amplitude distribution in the wave function of 
a electron beam emanating from a specimen in a transmission electron microscope. 
Although this method also aims to gather information about object structures, it does not 
utilize mutually coherent electron beams and is appropriate only for transmission 
electron microscopy. Prior art document Appl. Phys. Left. 59(19), November 4, 1991, pages 
2372-2374, discloses a method which utilizes two mutually coherent electron beams in 
order to generate a hologram, notably to examine both phase ad amplitude of a 
electron beam having passed through a object. Both methods cited exhibit substantial advantages over direct imaging, 
but both suffer from some intrinsic limitations. The principal limitations of said 
holography method are the fact that an area of interest should be situated near a region 
where a electron beam can pass without interaction, and the fact that a substantial 
amount of information is lost due to chromatic aberration of the electron optical system 
used. Furthermore, an apparatus for carrying out the method requires some fundamental 
adaptations, point information of a specimen becomes delocalized due to spherical 
aberration, and the method requires the use of a image detector with a number of 
detector elements which substantially exceeds the number of pixels to be recorded. The 
principal limitations of the in-focus variation method consist in that no phase contrast 
can be obtained in the range of low spatial frequencies and that a substantial amount of 
information in the rage of high spatial frequencies is lost due to chromatic aberrations. 
Further problems occur in that point information becomes delocalized due to the fact  
 
that information of a large number of images (as may as ten or even more) must be 
combined. Non-linear effects tend to impose time-consuming iterative calculation 
methods for image reconstruction. It is inter alia an object of the present invention to overcome the 
described restrictions and difficulties; to this end, a method of the kind set forth 
according to the invention is characterized in that the two mutually coherent beams are 
applied to a common part of the

A method for examining object structures in a electron beam apparatus

mutually coherent electron beams are applied to a common part of the object in order to 
generate a interference pattern, and that resultant signals carrying information 

correlated with the object structure are detected. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that a first electron 
beam is applied to a object and a reference electron beam is applied to the object in a 

direction collinear with the direction of a electron beam diffracted from the first 
electron beam so as to form a combined beam in conjunction herewith, the electron 

current in the combined beam being measured as a function of the relative phase 
differences between the diffracted beam and the reference beam in order to determine 

both amplitude ad phase of the diffracted electron beam. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that a reference beam 
is applied through the object in order to generate a interference pattern with the 

diffracted beam in an image plane of the object, the amplitude of said interference 
pattern, derived from a Fourier transform of the image, being expressed as a function of 

the relative phase difference between the diffracted beam and the reference beam. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, in which a zero- order diffracted 
beam derived from the first electron beam is stopped by a aperture. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, 3 or 4, characterized in that a 
diffracted beam, derived from the reference beam, which would give, by interference 

with the zero-order beam of the primary beam, a similar interference pattern in an 
image plane of the object, is stopped by an aperture. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that a interference 
pattern is produced on the object and signals which are characteristic of the atomic

one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that it comprises a rotatable electron 
biprism which is imaged slightly out of focus on the object in order to achieve standing

in order to rotate the image of the crystal without influencing the imaging, the 

magnification or the focusing. 
An electron beam apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, 8 or 9, characterized

beam pass symmetrically through a objective lens, avoiding energy-dependent relative 
phase shifts in said lens due to chromatic aberration.

An electron beam apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11, 
wherein chromatic aberration of the objective lens is compensated for by chromatic 

effects in the crystal and/or further optical elements.
