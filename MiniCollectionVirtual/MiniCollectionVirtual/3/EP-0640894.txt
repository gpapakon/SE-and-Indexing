<ABSTRACT>
A pair of band connecting lugs are formed on 
opposite sides of the watch case. Each lug has a groove 

formed on the underside of the lug in the lateral 
direction with respect to the band, an opening of the 

groove having a smaller width than a width of the 
groove. A band has a pair of cylindrical portions 

forming a recess there-between. A connecting pin 
comprising a solid pin and a hollow pin slidably mounted 

on the solid pin is engaged with the cylindrical potions 
of the band. The solid pin has a small diameter portion 

which is able to pass the opening of the groove. Each 
of the solid pin and the hollow pin has a large diameter 

portion which is engageable with the groove and is 
unable to pass the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connection of a 
band to a watch case. Figs. 6 and 7 show a conventional connection of a 
band to a watch case. A watch case 31 has a pair of 
band connecting lugs 32 formed to be projected at band 
connecting sides, and a guide groove 34 formed on the 
surface thereof, having a semicircular shape. Each of 
the band connecting lugs 32 has a lateral groove 33 
formed thereon, extending in the lateral direction of 
the band. A connecting pin 41 connected to a band 40 is 
engaged with the lateral groove 33. A bezel 35 is 
pivotally mounted on the watch case 31. The bezel 35 
has a lug 39 corresponding to the connecting lug 32 of 
the watch case, a pipe 36 secured to the underside 
thereof to be slidably engaged with the guide groove 34 
of the watch case, and a ball 37 mounted in the pipe 36 
and urged by a spring 38. In order to connect the band 40 to the watch case 
31, the bezel 35 is rotated along the guide groove 34 so 
as to expose the lateral groove 33 of the connecting lug 
32. During the rotation, the ball 37 in the pipe 36 is 
rotated in the guide groove 34 so that the bezel 35 can 
be rotated, keeping the engagement with the watch case 
31. The pin 41 connected to the band 40 is engaged with  
 
the lateral groove 33 of the connecting lug 32. 
Thereafter, the bezel 35 is returned to the original 
position to hide the connecting lug 32. In such a connection, since it is not necessary to 
disengage the connecting pin 41 from the band 40, the 
band is easily changeable without using a special tool. However, in manufacturing the watch, it is 
necessary to form a guide groove 34 on the watch case 31 
by cutting process and to secure the pipe 36 to the 
bezel 35. Therefore, the watch is complicated in 
structure, which causes manufacturing cost to increase. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
connection of a band to a watch case which is simple in 
structure and may be made at a low cost. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a connection in which the band is easily 
changeable without removing a connecting pin from the 
band and without special technique and a tool. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a connection of a band to a watch case 
comprising a pair of band connecting lugs formed on 
opposite sides of the watch case, each of the lugs 
having a groove formed on the underside of the lug in 
the lateral direction with respect to the band, an 
opening of the groove having a smaller width than a 
width of the

A connection of a band to a watch case 
comprising: 


a pair of band connecting lugs formed on opposite 
sides of the watch case, each of the lugs having a 

groove formed on the underside of the lug in the lateral 
direction with respect to the band, an opening of the 

groove having a smaller width than a width of the 
groove; 
the band having a bifurcated connecting end 
comprising a pair of cylindrical portions forming a 

recess there-between so as to be engaged with the lug of 
the watch case; 
a connecting pin engaged in the cylindrical 
portions of the band; 
the connecting pin comprising a solid pin and a 
hollow pin slidably mounted on the solid pin, the solid 

pin having a small diameter portion which is able to 
pass the opening of the groove, and each of the solid 

pin and the hollow pin having a large diameter portion 
which is engageable with the groove and is unable to 

pass the opening. 
The connection of the band to the watch case 
according to claim 1 wherein the solid pin and the 

hollow pin have joining portions which are engaged with 
each other in a contract state. 
The connection of the band to the watch case 
according to claim 1 wherein the solid pin and the  

 
hollow pin have stopper portions for preventing both 

pins from disengaging from each other.
