<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connecting construction
between a coil wire and a lead wire, which is effectively
employed, for example, in a magneto generator which is
mounted on a internal-combustion engine.In general, a stator of a magneto generator which is
mounted on a internal-combustion engine of a vehicle such as
motorcycle, comprises:
a stator core in which a plurality of salient poles are
arranged on a ring-shaped core;coil bobbins are attached on a stator core so as to cover
a part of the core and each salient pole; anda group of coil wires, in which each coil wire is
respectively wound on each coil bobbin. In this kind of the
stator of the magneto generator, it is necessary to connect
the coil wire end to a battery or headlight and the like of
the vehicle for supplying the generated electricity.In the past, as a construction for connecting a coil wire
end and a lead wire to each other in a stator of a magneto 
generator, a connecting construction between a coil wire and
a lead wire has been used, which comprises:
a concave area, which holds the coil wire;a connection terminal which is installed to a coil wire
concave area, which is hereby electrically connected to the
coil wire;the connecting construction between a coil wire and a
lead wire in which the lead wire is electrically connected to
the coil wire through the connection terminal. Proposed is a
method for connecting the lead wire to the connection
terminal, in which the electric conductor of the coil wire
end is electrically connected to the so-called a poke-in tab
terminal, a crimp wire barrel terminal, a posted terminal and
the like, so that the terminal is electrically connected to
the connection terminal.This kind of the connecting construction between the coil
wire and the lead wire was described in laying open of Japanese
application No. 62-165764, No. 61-22744, 63-92239 and 5-146127.However, in the case in which the above terminal is used
in the stator of the magneto generator which is mounted on a
vehicle such as motorcycle; when the in-use environmental
temperature is approximately 150°C, which is a high
temperature for the above terminal, furthermore, the
vibration is intense, the contact resistance becomes large 
and heat-resistant insufficiency occurs, so that reliability
deteriorates.Furthermore, in the above stator of the magneto
generator, the connecting construction between a coil wire
and a lead wire are arranged on the same face, so that the
connecting portions need a large area. It is consequently
impossible to
