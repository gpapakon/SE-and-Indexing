<ABSTRACT>
A pipe liner bag (1) is provided for reliably lining 
a pipe (10) into which water may penetrate. The pipe 

liner bag has a double layer structure including an 
inner layer of a tubular nonwoven fabric (2) made of 

fine yarn of three deniers or less and an outer layer of 
a tubular nonwoven fabric (3) made of thicker yarn of 3 

- 15 deniers. The tubular nonwoven fabric (2) 
constituting the inner layer is impregnated with highly 

viscous and thixotropic hardenable resin mixed with 
granule fillers of a small diameter, while the tubular 

nonwoven fabric (3) constituting the outer layer is 
impregnated with hardenable resin mixed with granule 

filler of a larger diameter. After the pipe liner bag 
(1) is everted and inserted into a pipe (10) to be 

repaired by fluid pressure, the hardenable resin 
impregnated in the pipe liner bag is cured while 

maintaining the internal pressure thereof constant. 

When this pipe liner bag (1) is used to repair a pipe 
(10) from which a branch pipe (11) is branched off, it 

can be integrated with a branch pipe liner bag (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pipe lining techniques, and
more particularly to a pipe liner bag, a manufacturing method
therefor, and a pipe repair method which is conducted by using the
pipe liner bag.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and rehabilitated without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed 
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then the pressurized fluid is applied to the said
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the said pressurized fluid, and the tubular
flexible liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated
in the liner is heated, which is effected by heating the fluid
filling the tubular liner bag by means of hot steam,

<CLAIMS>
A pipe liner bag (1) formed in a double tube
structure, comprising:


an inner layer made of a first tubular nonwoven
fabric (2) weaved with first yarn, said first tubular

nonwoven fabric constituting the inner layer being
impregnated with a first thixotropic and highly viscous

hardenable resin such that it does not pour by water,
mixed with granule fillers of a first diameter; and
an outer layer made of a second tubular nonwoven
fabric (3) weaved with second yarn thicker than said

first yarn, said second tubular nonwoven fabric
constituting the outer layer being impregnated with

hardenable resin mixed with granule fillers of a second
diameter which is larger than said first diameter.
A pipe liner bag as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said first and second nonwoven

fabrics (2, 3) are made of polyester, polypropylene or
acrylic resin.
A pipe liner bag as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein said second tubular nonwoven

fabric (3) constituting the outer layer is coated with a
highly air-tight plastic film (4). 
A pipe liner bag as claimed in claim 3,
wherein said air-tight plastic film (4)

comprises polyethylene or polyurethane.
A pipe liner bag as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said hardenable resin impregnated

in said tubular nonwoven fabrics (2, 3) is selected from
unsaturated polyester resin, epoxy resin, and vinyl
