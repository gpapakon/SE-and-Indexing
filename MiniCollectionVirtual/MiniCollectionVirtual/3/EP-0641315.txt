<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low-pressure process for 
the manufacture of aminonitriles. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a convenient low-pressure 
process for the selective partial hydrogenation of 
dinitriles. The process gives a high yield with high 
selectivity and high conversion of the starting material 
through use of a Raney catalyst at moderate temperatures 
and with either an excess of liquid ammonia or an 
alcohol solvent containing an inorganic base. With few exceptions, the hydrogenation of 
aliphatic dinitriles, NCRCN (I), is usually carried out 
to completion, i.e., with addition of 4 mol of hydrogen 
per mol of dinitrile, in order to prepare the 
corresponding diamines, H2NCH2RCH2NH2 (II) . These are 
used, among other applications, in production of various 
polyamides. Thus, for example, adiponitrile is 
hydrogenated to hexamethylenediamine, one of the two 
monomers required in the production of Nylon 6,6; 
methylglutaronitrile is hydrogenated to 
methylpentamethylenediamine and/or 3-methylpiperidine; 
and dodecanedinitrile is hydrogenated to 
dodecamethylenediamine. The preparation of linear aminonitriles by 
hydrogenation of the corresponding dinitriles is known. 
U.S. Pats. 2,208,598 (1940) and 2,257,814 (1941) to 
Rigby of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. disclose 
nickel-on alumina and cobalt-containing catalysts in 
liquid ammonia and teach away from the use of nickel as 
a catalyst.  
 A development by Swerdloff (U.S. Pat. 2,762,835 
(1956)) carries out the essential reaction in a mixed 
organic solvent, such as methyal (i.e., 
dimethoxymethane), dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, or methyl 
cyclohexane, which is inert to hydrogen; the reaction is 
terminated after at least 40% and before more than 65% 
of the dinitrile originally present is reacted. A 
specified method of practicing the invention involves 
using a hydrogenation catalyst of the ferrous metal 
group. An organic solvent is used and the reaction is 
conducted in the presence of anhydrous ammonia. 
Unreacted dinitrile must be distilled or extracted from 
the aminonitrile. The use of Raney nickel and Group VIII metal 
catalysts in solvents such as benzene and toluene are 
disclosed in German Pats. 836,938 (1952) and 848,654 
(1952), both issued to BASF. Selectivity to aminonitriles can be achieved using 
Rh/MgO catalyst, as disclosed in U.S. Pats. 4,389,348 
(1983) and 4,601,859 (1986), both to Allied Corporation, 
and in a paper "Preparation and Characterization of a 
Novel Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of
