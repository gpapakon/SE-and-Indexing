<ABSTRACT>
A controllable conduction device, such as a FET transistor, 
has channel (12) for conventional mass charge carrier flow 

between a source (14) and a drain (15) region under the 
control of an overlying gate (16). Interdigitated fingers 

(17) are formed in the gate, which induce a multiple tunnel 
junction configuration in the channel, so that charge 

carrier transport in the channel is inhibited by Coulomb 
blockade when the device is turned off, thereby reducing 

the leakage current.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a controllable conduction device
that includes a multiple tunnel junction and has particular
application to switching devices such as FET transistors.In a conventional FET transistor or similar controlled
conduction devices, current flows from a source to a drain
through an electron channel under the control of a gate.
In the on state, a mass of electrons flows through the FET
channel. In the off state the current reduces to a level
approaching zero but many electrons still flow, resulting
in a so-called leakage current. This leakage current is an
impediment to miniaturization of large scale integrated
circuits (LSIs) since there is a considerable unwanted
power consumption in devices that include many thousands of
transistor elements.Much research has been directed recently to so-called
quantum electronics in which nanoscale islands are used to
store small numbers and in theory a single electron and a
number of devices have been proposed making use of this 
principle. Reference is directed to K.K. Likharev,
"Correlated discrete transfers of single electrons in
ultrasmall tunnel junctions" IBM J. Res. Develop. 32(1)
144-158 [1988], and J.R. Tucker "Complementary digital
logic based on the 'Coulomb blockade' J. Appl. Phys. 72(9),
4399-4413 [1992]. The devices operate on the principle of
Coulomb blockade, which inhibits charge tunnelling onto the
island. As will be explained in more detail hereinafter,
for a nanoscale island, the charging energy can exceed the
thermal energy of surrounding electrons so that the
charging energy provides a barrier to electrons attempting
to tunnel into the island and as a result, the charge on
the island remains fixed so that no single electron can
flow onto the island. This so-called Coulomb blockade of
charge tunnelling has hitherto only been used in devices
operating with small numbers of electrons and so far, has
the disadvantage that the devices need to be cooled to
temperatures approaching absolute zero because the islands
cannot be made sufficiently small to exhibit energies which
exceed the thermal energy at room temperature.European Patent Application Publication No. 0 389 761 (corresponding to the preamble of claim 1)
discloses a device which provides superlattice effects and
which includes a gate finger structure the dimensions of
which fall in the range 10nm - 250nm.In accordance with the present invention, it has been
appreciated that Coulomb blockade can be used with
advantage in conventional devices such as field effect
transistors,
