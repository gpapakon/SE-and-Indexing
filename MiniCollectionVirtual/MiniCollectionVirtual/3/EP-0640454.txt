<ABSTRACT>
A machine for the production of seating components having 
a plurality of movable press centers which are moved about by 

a track to a plurality of workstations where different 
manufacturing operations are performed. The track is equipped 

with transfer capability to selectively bypass one or more of 
the workstations to enable different components to be made 

simultaneously using different methods. The track can further 
move a press center off line for repair without interrupting 

the operation of the machine. 
Each centers comprising:
 

   a stationary press platen carrying a trim tool (24) for sharping said 
cover member;

 
   a movable press platen (28) having two sides with different tools 

(48,50) on each side for performing different manufacturing 
operations;

 
   means (46) for rotating said movable press platen (28) so one side or 

the other of said movable press platen faces said stationary press 
platen; and

 
   press means (34) for moving said movable press platen (28) toward 

said stationary press platen to move one of said tools to said trim tool 
for performing one of said manufacturing operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
manufacturing seating components and in particular to an 
apparatus with improved productivity by allowing certain time 
consuming operations to be performed "off-line" and/or to 
provide multiple stations for simultaneously performing time 
consuming operations. Assignee of the present invention has developed and 
patented two methods for manufacturing seat components such as 
a seat cushion or a seat back. These methods are described in 
U.S. Patents: 4,740,260 and 4,860,415. These patents are 
hereby incorporated by reference. Patent No. 4,740,260 describes a process in which a seat 
component is manufactured by first shaping a cover member 
between the fixed and movable dies of a press. After the cover 
member has been shaped, a preshaped foam pad is adhesively 
bonded to the inner surface of the cover member. Patent No. 
4,860,415, describes a process in which, after the cover member 
is shaped, a foam pad is molded in place directly on the shaped 
cover member through a pour-in-place process. Heretofore, seating components have been manufactured 
using one of the two above methods in which the seat components 
are manufactured on a carousel style machine. After all of the 
operations have been performed at each workstation of the 
machine, the machine advances each workpiece to the next  
 
workstation. The productivity of such a machine is limited by 
the operation that takes the longest time to complete. A 
further disadvantage of a carousel machine is that when a break 
down occurs at one workstation, the entire machine has to be 
stopped until the repair is completed. Another disadvantage 
is that all workpieces must travel to each workstation even if 
a process is being used which does not require a stop at each 
workstation. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
machine for manufacturing seating components which overcomes 
the above disadvantages. The machine of the present invention includes a plurality 
of movable press centers each containing the tooling necessary 
to manufacture a seating component. A track is provided for 
guiding movement of the press centers along a predetermined 
path. The path moves the press centers passed a plurality of 
workstations at which different operations are performed in the 
manufacturing of the seating components. To provide flexibility to the machine and to overcome the 
above disadvantages, the track is capable of selectively 
bypassing one or more of the workstations. This enables

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for use in manufacturing seating components having a 
foam pad with at least one shaped surface and a cover member shaped to 

correspond to said at least one shaped surface, said apparatus including press 
centers each comprising: 

   a stationary press platen carrying a trim tool for shaping said cover 
member; 

   a movable press platen having two sides with different tools on each 
side for performing different manufacturing operations; 

   means for rotating said movable press platen so one side or the other of 
said movable press platen faces said stationary press platen; and 

   press means for moving said movable press platen toward said 
stationary press platen to move one of said tools to said trim tool for performing one 

of said manufacturing operations. 
The apparatus for use in manufacturing seating components of Claim 1 
wherein one of the tools on said movable press platen is a form tool shaped 

complementary to said trim tool for shaping said cover member therebetween. 
The apparatus for use in manufacturing seating components of Claim 1 
wherein one of the tools on said movable press platen is a mounting fixture for 

releasably mounting a pre-shaped foam pad. 
The apparatus for use in manufacturing seating components of Claim 1 
 

wherein one of the tools on said movable press platen is a pour-in-place foaming 
mold for molding a foam pad directly onto said cover member. 
The apparatus for use in manufacturing seating components of Claim 1 
further comprising: 

   moving means for moving said press center along an endless path, said 
moving means including track means for guiding movement of said movable press
