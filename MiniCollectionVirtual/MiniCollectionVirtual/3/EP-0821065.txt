synthesizing prenyl diphosphates, shorter than those

synthesized by the original enzyme, by modifying the
amino acid sequence in and upstream of the aspartic

acid-rich domain DDXX(XX)D (X denotes any amino acid, and
XX in the parentheses may not be present) present in

region II of the prenyl diphosphate synthase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel mutant enzyme which synthesizes linear prenyl diphosphates that are precursors of compounds, important for organisms, such as steroids, ubiquinones, dolichols, carotenoids, prenylated proteins, animal hormones, plant hormones, and the like; a genetic system encoding said enzyme; and a method for producing and using said enzyme.Of the substances having important functions in organisms, many are biosynthesized using isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) as a constituent units. These compounds are also called isoprenoids, terpenoids, or terpenes, and are classified depending on the number of carbon atoms into hemiterpenes (C5), monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sesterterpenes (C25), triterpenes (C30), tetraterpenes (C40), and the like. The actual biosynthesis starts with the mevalonate pathway through which mevalonic acid-5-diphosphate is synthesized, followed by the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) which is an active isoprene unit.The identity of the isoprene unit that was proposed as a precursor was found to be isopentenyl diphosphate, the so-called active isoprene unit. Dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), an isomer of isopentenyl diphosphate, being used as a substrate in the synthesis of isopentenyl adenine which is known as a cytokinin, one of the plant hormones, it is also known to undergo a condensation reaction with isopentenyl diphosphate to synthesize chain-form active isoprenoids such as geranyl diphosphate (GPP), neryl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP), hexaprenyl diphosphate (HexPP), heptaprenyl diphosphate (HepPP), and the like.There are Z type and E type condensation reactions. Geranyl diphosphate is a product of E type condensation and neryl diphosphate is of Z type condensation. Although, the all-E type is considered to be the active form in farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, the Z type condensation reaction leads to the synthesis of natural rubber, dolichols, bactoprenols (undecaprenols), and plants various polyprenols found in. They are believed to undergo the condensation reaction using the phosphate ester bond energy of the pyrophosphate and the carbon backbone present in the molecule and to produce pyrophosphate as the byproduct of the reaction.Farnesyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate serve as a reaction substrate leading to the synthesis of prenylated proteins (from farnesyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl
