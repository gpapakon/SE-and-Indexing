<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a device with "SOFT TOUCH" 
mechanics for reproducing recorded tapes whereby one motor 

performs all the main functions and having an electronic 
control unit that determines the motor speed according to 

the function selected on the pushbutton control panel of 
the appliance: the device in question is also equipped with 

a secondary motor which is activated only when the tape 
cassette is inserted and ejected and which temporarily 

moves the reading head and the tape rollers away from the 
tape during fast forward and rewind of the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device with soft touch mechanics
as defined in the preamble of claim 1.Soft touch mechanics is intended as a conventional system
involving movements controlled by means of motors and an
electronic control unit, connected to the push-button
control panel of the appliance.In current appliances, commonly known as "tape recorders"
or "cassette recorders", two separate electric motors are
used for operating the various mechanisms; one motor
unwinds the tape during play-back while a secondary motor
operates all the other functions, either directly or using
the principle of kinematic motion: insertion and ejection
of the tape, rewinding of the tape during play-back, fast
forward and rewind. Generally, in current models, once the secondary motor has
completed the insertion of the tape, a specially designed
double electromagnet releases the pinion of this motor from
the mechanism which engages the tape holder box with the
mechanism for rewinding of the tape during play-back.The main motor is generally a D.C. motor which is sold with
a self-regulating electronic control unit that adjusts
voltage variations from 9 - 15 Volts thereby guaranteeing
the forward movement of the tape at a steady rate, equal to
a preset play-back value.It is worth mentioning that said main motor rotates only in
one direction.As mentioned, the secondary motor is equipped with an
electronic control unit designed specifically for the
mechanics in question.This means that while manufacturers of "tape recorder"
mechanics on one hand simply need to purchase standard
self-regulating motors normally available on the market, on
the other hand they are forced to order electronic control
units specifically designed for the management and control
of the mechanics in question.The innovative idea according to this invention involves
the use of a standard first motor, namely a motor without an
electronic self-regulating device, which performs all the
main functions of the appliance thanks to the use of a
single electronic control unit programmed to activate and
control all the different operating modes that can be
provided by "tape recorder" mechanics. In other words, the idea according to the invention
involves the use of a standard electric motor which rotates
at different speeds in both directions (such as a
conventional D.C. or A.C. motor or a brushless motor)
combined with a microprocessor which determines and
controls motor operation according to the function selected
on the push-button control board of the appliance,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device with soft touch mechanics for reproducing
recorded tapes including a first electric motor (1), a second electric motor (2), whereby one motor performs all the main

functions of the type consisting of a first kinematic
motion for unwinding the tape during play-back, a second

kinematic motion (C1) for rewinding of the tape during
play-back and fast forward and rewind of the tape 
and a
third kinematic motion for the insertion and automatic

ejection of the tape (C); said device with soft touch
mechanics being characterized in that the first two

kinematic motions are operated by a first electric motor (1) which
rotates at different speeds in both directions and which

has an electronic control unit which determines the
rotation speed of said first motor (1) according to the function

selected on the push-button control panel of the appliance;
further characterized in that the third kinematic motion is

operated by the second electric motor (2) which is
activated only during the insertion and automatic ejection

phases of the tape and to determine the temporary moving
away of the reading head (20) and of the stop rollers (4b 

and 5b) from the tape during the fast forward and rewind of
the tape.
A a device with soft touch mechanics for reproducing
recorded tapes

according to claim 1, characterized in that the
third kinematic motion includes:


a worm screw (11) having a horizontal axis which engages
with a geared wheel (12) keyed on a shaft (13) having a

vertical axis on which a centre cam (14) and two end gears
(15 and 16) are fixed.

Said cam (14) consists of a cylindrical body whose lateral
surface has a groove characterized by an initial circular

section (14a) at the base which continues with a helicoidal
section (14b) to terminate at the top with a final circular

section (14c);
a normally open micro-switch (21), which stops the second motor
(2) whenever it is closed or by the interference of a tooth

(18c) on the ejection lever (18) or by the interference of
an element (19b) on the sliding block (19) on which both

the tape rollers (4b and 5b) and the reading head (20) are
mounted;
an angular toothed section (18a) engaging with said end
gear (15) being a part of the ejection lever (18) which

oscillates on a horizontal plane around a vertical
pivoting pin (18b) coupled to the brake (F);
a rack (19a) engaging with the other end gear (16) being
part of the above sliding block (19); 
a tape holder box (17) characterized by a lateral pin
(17a) engaged in the groove of the cam (14) and by a bottom

tooth (17b) opposing, at the end of the downward stroke, a
counter-tooth (19c) projecting from said sliding block

(19).

rotates, by means of a drive belt (3), the flywheels (4 and
5) on which pins (4a and 5a) for unwinding the tape during

play-back, are keyed.
A device with soft touch mechanics for reproducing
recorded tapes

according to claim 1, characterized in that
the first motor (1)

are keyed for winding the tape by means of a kinematic

motion (C1) consisting of a number of toothed engaging
wheels, the last of which is mounted on a rocking lever

(10) which oscillates to commute the transmission from one
clutch wheel to another.
