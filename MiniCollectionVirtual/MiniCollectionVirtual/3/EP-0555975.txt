<ABSTRACT>
An insole (18,34,38,46,42,52) 
for articles of footwear comprises an apertured 

top layer (20) formed from a non-absorbent, thermally non-conductive 
thermoplastic material which is affixed to a 

stabilizing layer (22) formed of a non-woven material. The 
stabilizing layer, in turn, is affixed to a barrier layer (40) 

and/or a cushioning layer (36,50,44) to form insoles for articles of 
footwear intended for different activities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to insoles for articles of 
footwear. New designs of footwear, and particularly footwear 
intended for sports or other active wear, have provided 
improvements in the support, cushioning  
 
and stability in an effort to reduce injuries to the 
feet, ankles and knees. One aspect of active wear 
footwear design which has been overlooked, however, is 
the configuration and surface characteristics of the 
insole or sockliner of the article of footwear as they 
relate to the ability of the insole to maintain the 
foot and sock insulated from the sole of the footwear, 
and the extent which the foot and sock are permitted 
to move within the article of footwear. One problem with many insoles for active 
wear footwear involves a failure to control the motion 
of the sock of the wearer relative to the insole 
and/or the motion of the foot of the wearer with 
respect to the sock. This affects both the comfort 
and performance of the shoe. For example, certain 
activities such as the play of tennis on clay courts 
and soccer on grass result in substantial movement of 
the shoe with respect to the playing surface. In 
these types of activities, it is desirable to limit 
the movement of the foot and sock with respect to the 
insole of the article of footwear for added comfort 
and to optimize the performance of the footwear. On 
the other hand, comfort and performance of the article 
of footwear dictate that the foot and sock be permitted 
more movement within footwear intended for use in 
activities such as basketball, racquetball and aerobics 
which are typically played on a lacquered  
 
hardwood floor wherein limited movement of the article 
of footwear relative to the playing surface is permitted 
and therefore relatively high shear forces are 
transmitted from the footwear to the foot. Prior art insoles can generally be divided 
into two categories, both of which fail to take into 
account the movement of the foot and/or sock within 
the article of footwear and the type of surface on 
which the footwear is utilized. In some designs, the 
top surface of the insole is formed of a tacky or 
sticky material, or a material which becomes relatively 
tacky when exposed to moisture from the foot. 
Insoles of this type exhibit a higher coefficient of 
friction than the coefficient of friction of the skin 
of the foot. As a result, the magnitude of the 
frictional engagement between the sock and insole is 
greater than the magnitude of the frictional engagement 
between the foot and sock.

<CLAIMS>
An insole (18, 34, 38, 42, 46, 52) for an article 
of footwear (10), comprising a slip-resistant, non-absorbent 

and thermally non-conductive top layer (20) 
having a first surface adapted to contact the sock (14) of 

a wearer of the article of footwear (10) and a second 
surface, the top layer (20) being formed with intersecting 

wall sections (30, 32) defining a plurality of apertures 
(24), said insole (18, 34, 38, 42, 46, 52) further 

comprising a second layer (22, 48) affixed to the second 
surface of the top layer (20) characterised in that the 

second layer (22, 48) is formed of a non-woven fibrous 
material which is permanently affixed to the second 

surface of the top layer (20), the second layer (22, 48) 
acting as stabilizing layer which substantially reduces 

movement of the wall sections (30, 32) of the top layer 
(20) relative to one another in response to the 

application of a shear force to the top layer (20). 
An insole as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the top 
layer (20) is formed of an ethylene-vinyl acetate 

copolymer. 
An insole as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the 
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer has a vinyl acetate 

content in the range of about 3% to 40% by weight. 
An insole as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the top layer (20) includes a thermoplastic 

elastomer. 
An insole as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the top layer (20) has between about 7 and 107 

apertures per square centimeter.  
 
An insole as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the apertures (24) are square in shape, the 

apertures (24) forming spaced columns (26) of first wall 
sections (30) and spaced rows (28) of second wall sections 

(30) which intersect the first wall sections (30), the top 
layer (20) having between about 8 and 9 columns of first 

wall sections (30) per lineal centimeter and between about 
8 and 9 rows of second wall sections (32) per lineal 

centimeter. 
An insole as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the wall sections (30, 32) have a height dimension 

and a width dimension each between about .38 and 3.8 
millimeters.

wherein the non-woven material is formed of polyester, a 

blend of polyester and rayon, or a blend of cellulosic 
fibers and polyester. 
An insole as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the top layer (20) has frictional characteristics 

such that the magnitude of the frictional engagement 
between the first surface of the top layer (2) and the 

sock (14) is maintained less than the magnitude of the frictional 
engagement between the sock (14) and the foot of the wearer whether the 

top layer (20) is wet or dry, whereby the foot and sock (14) are 
movable as a unit with respect to the first surface of the 

top layer (20) while the foot is maintained substantially 
fixed within the sock. 
An insole as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein a barrier layer (40) affixed to the second

(10). 
An insole as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 10 
further comprising a first cushioning layer (36) having a

footwear. 
An insole as claimed in any one of Claims 10 to 12 
wherein the barrier layer (40) is formed of a
