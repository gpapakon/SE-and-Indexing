<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an agricultural machine with covering devices (1) which are held next to one another on a supporting beam (6) and which have covering elements (5) set rearwards obliquely to the direction of travel and extending essentially horizontally above the ground, each covering device (1) being provided with two covering elements (5) and the effective ranges of adjacent covering devices (1) overlapping one another. In order to counteract a risk of clogging of the covering elements (5) and, at the same time, to achieve as many overlaps of the effective surfaces of the covering elements (5) as possible, the two covering elements (5) are arranged parallel to one another.
