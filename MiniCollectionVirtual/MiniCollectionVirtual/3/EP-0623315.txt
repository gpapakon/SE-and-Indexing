<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of operation are disclosed for 
using an expandable balloon catheter (10) to perform a 

combination angioplasty and atherectomy procedure on a 
stenotic blood vessel. The expandable balloon (12) has a 

plurality of atherotomes (19) attached to its outer surface, and 
longitudinal, transverse, or rotational oscillatory motion 

is imparted to the atherotomes to assist in incising the 
stenotic tissue, prior to or during dilatation of the 

stenotic segment of the blood vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to devices
which dilate a blood vessel across a stenotic segment of
the vessel. In particular, the present invention relates
to apparatus for the dilatation of a stenotic
segment of a blood vessel using a combination device for
compression and incision of the stenosis. More
particularly, this invention relates to
apparatus employing a folding balloon catheter having
oscillatable atherotomes mounted along the outer surface of
the balloon or the catheter.Blockage of human arteries is a widespread malady and,
as such, represents a significant health concern.
Blockages reducing blood flow through the coronary arteries
to the heart can cause heart attacks, while blockages
reducing blood flow through the arteries to the brain can
cause strokes. Similarly, arterial blockages reducing
blood flow through arteries to other parts of the body can
produce grave consequences in an affected organ or limb.The build-up of atherosclerotic plaque is a chief
cause of blockages, termed stenoses, which reduce blood 
flow through the arteries. Consequently, several methods
have been introduced to alleviate the effects of plaque
build-up in restricting the artery. One such method is a
procedure termed angioplasty, which uses an inflatable
device positioned at the stenosis to dilate the artery. A
typical angioplasty device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,896,669 to Bhate et al. The angioplasty device of Bhate
et al. includes an inflatable balloon which is attached to
the distal end of a hollow catheter tube. The proximal end
of the catheter tube is attached to a fluid source.To treat an arterial stenosis, the balloon of Bhate et
al. is introduced into the artery in a deflated state and
guided through the artery over a guide wire to a position
adjacent the stenosis. Fluid from the fluid source is then
infused into the balloon via the catheter tube to inflate
the balloon. As the balloon expands, it presses against
the arterial wall in the region of the stenosis, dilating
the artery at the stenosis and restoring it to a sufficient
size for adequate blood flow therethrough The balloon is
then deflated and removed from the artery, thereby
completing the treatment. Sometimes, the effectiveness of
this treatment is limited, because the stenotic tissue is
left essentially intact.Another method is disclosed in U. S. Patent No.
4,273,128 to Lary. In the Lary method, a combination
balloon and surgical knife assembly is inserted into the
blood vessel and advanced to the stenosis. The knife blade 
is
