<ABSTRACT>
This secondary cell uses carbonous material whose true density and crystal structure parameters satisfy specific 
conditions as the material of the negative electrode, a transition metal compound oxide which has a specific ion 

supplying ability as the material of the positive electrode, and ethylene carbonate as the nonaqueous solvant. For the 
carbon material, the true density is 2.1 g/cm³ or more; the interval between the 002 faces is less than 0.34 nm; the 

thickness of crystallite in the direction of the C axis of the 002 face is more than 16.0 nm; and the G value of the 
Raman spectrum is 2.5 or more. The transition metal compound oxide is an oxide which contains lithium equivalent 

to the charge and discharge capacity of 250 mAh or more for unit weight of the carbonous material. The particle 
size of the carbonous material is preferably one µm or more. The nonaqueous solvent may be a solvent of a mixture 

of ethylene carbonate and chain carbonic ester. As the chain carbonic ester, diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, 
methyl ethyl carbonate, and others can be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte
secondary battery using a carbon material for its anode.As technologies in electronics have been remarkably evolved,
a variety of electronic equipment has become smaller and lighter.
Accordingly, it has been required that batteries as portable
power sources be increasingly smaller, lighter, and higher in
energy density.Conventionally, aqueous solution type secondary batteries,
such as lead batteries and nickel-cadmium batteries, are
primarily used as secondary batteries for general use. However,
though these aqueous solution type secondary batteries exhibit
excellent cyclic properties, they are not satisfactory in weight
and energy density.Meanwhile, recently, a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte
secondary battery using lithium or a lithium alloy for its anode
has been researched and developed prevalently. This non-aqueous
liquid electrolyte secondary battery has a high energy density,
exhibits only a small amount of self-discharge, and is
lightweight. However, in the non-aqueous liquid electrolyte
secondary battery, lithium is crystallized in dendritic form in
proceedings of charge/discharge cycles, and the crystallized 
lithium finally reaches the cathode to generate an internal short
circuit. Therefore, it is difficult to employ this non-aqueous
liquid electrolyte secondary battery for practical use.On the contrary, a lithium ion based non-aqueous liquid
electrolyte secondary battery which uses a carbon material for
its anode has attracted attention for the following reasons. The
non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery utilizes dope
and undope of lithium into and from between carbon layers. By
doing so, the battery does not exhibit the dendritic
precipitation of lithium in the charge even though
charge/discharge cycles proceed. The battery exhibits
satisfactory charge/discharge cyclic properties.Meanwhile, the carbon materials are roughly categorized into
low-crystalline carbon materials, such as cokes and glass like
carbon, having a pseudo-graphite structure or a turbostratic
structure, and high-crystalline carbon materials, such as
graphite, having a grown crystalline structure.Among these carbon materials, the low-crystalline carbon
material has conventionally been used as the anode material of
the non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary battery, because of
its high compatibility with propylene carbonate (PC) normally
used for the non-aqueous solvent of the non-aqueous liquid
electrolyte secondary battery.That is, both the
