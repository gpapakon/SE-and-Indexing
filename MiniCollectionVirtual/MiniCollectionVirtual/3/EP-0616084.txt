<ABSTRACT>
A quick coupling comprising: a support (10) to be 
fixed to the power arm of an earth-mover; elements (12) 

with a hook-like end (13), suitable to fit between the 
upper part of a bucket (24) or the like and a transverse 

pivot (26) thereof, extending on one side from the arm, and 
means for fixing to the bucket or the like extending on the 

opposite side from the arm. The fixing means comprise a 
locking element (20) slidingly coupled to the support (18) 

and coupled to means (22) suitable to push it so that it 
fits with one end (29) in a corresponding seat (28) of a 

cross-member (27) protruding from the upper part of the 
bucket or the like. This end has, on the same side as the 

support, an inclined surface suitable to rest against a 
corresponding inclined surface of the seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-locking quick 
coupling for fitting buckets or the like to earth-movers. Couplings are already known which are suitable to 
obtain, in a simple and rapid manner, an interchangeable 
association between buckets of different kinds and an 
earth-mover, for example during excavation and earth-moving 
work. A particular type of quick coupling is composed of a 
supporting plate which can be fixed to the power arm of the 
earth-mover; elements with a curved end, suitable to fit 
between the upper part of the bucket and a transverse pivot 
thereof, extend from one side of said supporting plate. A hook-like element is articulated from the opposite 
side of the plate and keeps a downward-facing position by 
virtue of elastic elements cooperating with fixing 
elements. The hook-like element is suitable to anchor and 
release, by rotation, a transverse element protruding from 
the upper part of the bucket. Although it optimally performs its specific tasks, 
this type of quick coupling is not free from drawbacks, 
including a certain constructive complication of the part 
comprising the hook-like element and the onset of excessive 
plays between the various elements as the coupling is 
subjected to intense work loads. An aim of the present invention is to provide a quick 
coupling for fitting buckets or the like to earth-movers  
 
which allows to eliminate the drawbacks described above in 
known types and which is particularly self-locking. A further aim is to provide a quick coupling which 
provides for the recovery of plays as they form. Another important aim is to provide a quick coupling 
characterized by easy use and by low maintenance 
requirements. Another important aim is to provide a quick coupling 
which is easy to install and adapt on current earth-movers 
and on current types of buckets or the like. Another object is to provide a quick coupling which 
can be manufactured at low cost with conventional 
production equipment. With these and other objects in view, there is 
provided, according to the present invention, a quick 
coupling of the type comprising: a support which can be 
fixed to the power arm of an earth-mover; elements with a 
hook-like end, suitable to fit between the upper part of a 
bucket or the like and a transverse pivot thereof, 
extending on one side from said arm; and means for fixing 
to the bucket or the like extending on the opposite side 
from said arm; said coupling being characterized in that 
said fixing means comprise a locking element

<CLAIMS>
Quick coupling comprising: a support (10; 110) 
which can be fixed to the power arm of an earth-mover; 

elements (12; 112) with a hook-like end (13; 113), suitable 
to fit between the upper part of a bucket (24) or the like 

and a transverse pivot (26; 126) thereof, extending on one 
side from said arm; and means (20, 22, 28; 120, 122, 128) 

for fixing to the bucket or the like extending on the 
opposite side from said arm; said coupling being 

characterized in that said fixing means comprise a locking 
element (20; 120) slidingly coupled to said support and 

coupled to means (22; 122) suitable to push it so that it 
fits with one end (29; 129) in a corresponding seat (28
; 
128) of a cross-member (27; 127) protruding from the upper 

part of said bucket or the like, said end having, on the 
same side as said support, an inclined surface (30; 130) 

suitable to rest against a corresponding inclined surface 
of said seat (28; 128). 
Coupling according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said locking element (20; 120) is slideably coupled to 

said support in a direction substantially parallel thereto 
and to said upper part of said bucket or the like. 
Coupling according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said locking element can slide in a block (18; 118) 

welded to said support. 
Coupling according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said means suitable to push 

said locking element are constituted by a fluid-actuated 
and/or pneumatic piston (22) and/or equivalent means. 
Coupling according to claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that said means suitable to push said locking element 

are constituted by elastic means (122), such as a rubber-type 
bushing or equivalent means. 
Coupling according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said cross-member (27; 127) 

protruding from the upper part of said bucket or the like 
is arranged at an angle with respect to the ideal line 

perpendicular to said sliding direction of said locking 
element, said seat (28; 128) being formed by a through hole 

of said cross-member which is at right angles to its larger 
surfaces. 
Coupling according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said inclined surface (30; 

130) of said end of said locking element is constituted by 
a chamfer. 
Coupling according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said corresponding inclined 

surface of said seat is constituted by the upper wall of 
said through hole. 
Coupling according to claim 5, characterized in 
that it comprises a pin (134) welded to said support and a 

pin (132) fixed to said locking element, a lever element 
(135) acting on said pins and being suitable to use one of 

them as fulcrum and apply a manual thrust on the other in 
contrast with said elastic means.
