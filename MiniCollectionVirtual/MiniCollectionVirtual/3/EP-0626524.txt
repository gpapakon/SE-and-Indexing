<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a pneumatically actuated floating caliper disc brake for commercial vehicles, in the case of which disc brake a floating caliper (20) enclosing a brake disc (1) is mounted, by means of two guide bearings (21,22), on corresponding guide members (11,12) of a brake carrier (10) fixed to the vehicle, it being possible for said floating caliper to be displaced in the radial direction of the brake disc (1). The invention proposes to provide, in the first guide bearing (21), an elastomeric guide bushing (33,34) which has a relatively long running surface and is thus dimensioned such that there is a transition fit with respect to the first guide member (11), while, in the second guide bearing (21), there is arranged an elastomeric guide bushing (32) which has a relatively short running surface and is dimensioned such that the second guide member (12) slides with a defined degree of play.

Pneumatically actuated floating-caliper disc brake for commercial vehicles, 
wherein a floating caliper (20), comprising a brake disc (1), is 

supported for displacement in the radial direction of said brake disc 
(1), by means of two guide bearings (21, 22), at appropriate guiding 

longerons (11, 12) of a brake bracket (10) integral with the vehicle, 

characterized in
 that an elastomer guide sleeve (33, 34) is fitted in the 
first one (21) of said guide bearings, which presents a comparatively 

long bearing surface and is dimensioned so as to achieve a transition 
fit towards the first guiding longeron (11), and in that an elastomer 

guide sleeve (32) is fitted in the second one (22) of said guide bearings, 
which has a comparatively short bearing surface and is so dimensioned 

that the second guiding longeron (12) will slide at a defined 
clearance, with the defined clearance of said second guiding 

longeron (12) being in the range from 0.2 to 0.5 mm. 
Disc brake according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said elastomer 
guide sleeve of said first guide bearing (21) is formed by a plurality of 

elastomer guide sleeves (33, 34). 
Disc brake according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 two elastomer 
guide sleeves (33, 34) are fitted in said first guide bearing (21), preferably 

in the respective marginal areas thereof, and in that a single 
elastomer guide sleeve (32) is fitted in said second guide bearing, 

with the dimensions of these three elastomer guide sleeves (32 Ã  35) 
being substantially equal. 
Disc brake according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that 
said elastomer guide sleeves (32 to 34) are provided with a friction-reducing 

material at their bearing surfaces.  
 
Disc brake according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 a dry lubricant 
or a layer applied on the bearing surface, or a film embedded or fixed 

by vulcanization, or a textile web embedded or fixed by vulcanization, 
is provided as friction-reducing material which consists of a friction-reducing 

synthetic in each case. 
Disc brake according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 Teflon is applied 
as friction-reducing synthetic. 
Disc brake according to any of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in
 that 
said elastomer guide sleeves (32 to 34) present a peripheral shoulder 

(43) at their outside periphery, which is adapted for introduction into 
a recess of mating shape on the the respective guide bearing. 
Disc brake according to any of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
 that 
said elastomer guide sleeves (32 to 34) present, at least at one of the 

two ends of their bearing surface, an annular packing washer (41). 
Disc brake according to any of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in
 that 
said elastomer guide sleeves (32 to 34) present, at least at one of the 

two ends of their outside circumferential area, a profiled peripheral 
sealing (42). 
Disc brake according to any of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in
 that a 
plurality of peripheral recesses (40) are formed in the bearing surfaces 

of said elastomer guide sleeves (32 to 34). 
Disc brake according to any of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in
 that 
said elastomer guide sleeves (32 to 34) consist of a rubber material.
