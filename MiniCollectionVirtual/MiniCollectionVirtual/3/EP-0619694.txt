<ABSTRACT>
The generation of glow plasma due to discharge at an atmospheric 
pressure and its stabilization are monitored by counting 

the number of current pulses. Alternatively, they are monitored 
by the change of a retention voltage and/or the change of 

the full current value besides the number of the current pulses, or 
by Lissajous figures, to detect the plasma state and to stabilize 

and control the plasma. These procedures make it possible to 
stabilize and monitor the atmospheric pressure glow discharge 

plasma accurately, rapidly and readily, and to control the plasma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method to 
monitor atmospheric pressure glow discharge plasma. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
novel method to monitor atmospheric pressure glow 
discharge plasma that allows accurate monitoring and 
control of the generation and stabilization of 
atmospheric pressure glow discharge plasma which is used 
in surface treatment of solids, formation of thin films, 
decomposition of vapor-phase waste gases and reaction of 
vapor-phase synthesis, and the like. It has been actively studied to utilize plasma, 
which are generated by discharge, in various areas such 
as the surface treatment of semiconductors, electronics 
devices and other electronic materials, bio-materials, 
new functional polymers and other materials, the 
formation of thin film for developing new materials, the 
decomposition of waste gas, and the reaction of vaporphase 
synthesis. As a result, the technology has been 
established as a practical basic technology in several 
areas. Of these plasma techniques, the method to utilize 
glow discharge plasma generated under a so-called high 
vacuum condition, is an important part of the plasma 
CVD, ion plating, plasma etching, plasma surface 
treatment and other techniques. These low pressure glow discharge plasma 
techniques are recognized as effective in producing 
surfaces and thin films of relatively good quality. 
However, because it is necessary to maintain a low 
pressure condition, these techniques have the drawbacks 
that a vacuum system must be provided and maintained: it  
 
is difficult to sustain discharge; and a huge amount of 
cost is necessary to keep the system air-tight. This is because, according to the conventional 
technological knowledge, generation of glow discharge 
plasma generally requires a low pressure condition of 
several Torr or below. This is because, with rising 
pressure, the discharge concentrates on one point with 
the pressure at about 100 Torr, until the discharge 
shifts to sparks and arc discharge at about atmospheric 
pressure, making it impossible to uniformly process the 
subject to be processed. Now therefore the inventor of the present 
invention has established a glow discharge plasma 
technique which can be used under atmospheric pressure 
to replace conventional low pressure glow discharge 
plasma techniques, and has actively studied its 
applications as well. As a result, the inventor of the 
present invention has found that the present atmospheric 
pressure glow discharge plasma is

<CLAIMS>
A method of monitoring atmospheric pressure 
glow discharge plasma contained within a discharge 

device to which an a.c. voltage is applied,
 
characterised by the steps of detecting the number of 

electric current pulses in the current flow of the 
discharge device per one half-cycle of the a.c. voltage 

applied to the device, and determining that the plasma 
is in a glow discharge state when the number of pulses 

in the current flow per one half-cycle is less than or 
equal to a predetermined maximum number, and determining 

that the plasma is in a filament discharge state when 
the number of pulses in the current flow per one half-cycle 

is greater than the predetermined maximum number. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said monitoring 
is also based on a change in the retained voltage and/or 

the total electric current across the plasma. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
monitoring is also based on Lissajous figures indicating 

the correlation between the voltage and the current flow 
of the device. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the plasma is 
determined to be in a glow discharge state when the 

Lissajous figure consists of a jump between two voltage 
lines, and wherein the plasma is determined to be in a 

filament discharge state when the Lissajous figure is in 
the form of a closed parallelogram. 
The method of claim 3, wherein the plasma is 
determined to be in a glow discharge state when the 

Lissajous figure consists of a pair of substantially 
parallel lines, and wherein the plasma is determined to 

be in a filament dischage state when the Lissajous 
figure is in the form of a closed parallelogram.

predetermined maximum number is between one and three 

inclusive.
