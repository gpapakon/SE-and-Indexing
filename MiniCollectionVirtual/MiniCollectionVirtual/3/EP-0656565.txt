<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to EDM (Exposure, Defocus and Mask fabrication 
latitude) methodology and involves a 

photomask, a method of producing the same, a method 
of exposing using the same, and a method of manufacturing a 

semiconductor device using the same. 
Correlations are found involving a large 

number of mask parameters, thus permitting optimisation of a 
lithographic process parameter taking account of mask parameters 

as well as other lithographic process parameters 
One of defocus latitude (III), mask pattern dimension 
(e.g. linewidth) latitude (II) 

and exposure latitude (I) is combined with 
data in predetermined ranges for the other two latitudes 

to determine the values of the first 
latitude for optimisation of a lithographic process parameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing a photomask. The invention can be utilized for photomasks used for forming various pattern images, a method of producing such photomasks, a method of exposing using such photomasks and a method of manufacturing semiconductor devices using such photomasks. For example, it can be utilized for photomasks used for the techniques of forming various patterns in semiconductor device manufacture processes, a method of producing such photomasks and a method of exposing using such photomasks. Further, it can be applied to an exposing apparatus and also to a method of semiconductor device manufacture, for instance a method of manufacturing such semiconductor devices as memory devices, logic operational devices, CCD devices, LCD devices, etc.The related art will now be described by taking the field of semiconductor devices as an example. When manufacturing a semiconductor device, various patterns are formed. In such semiconductor device manufacture, a pattern transfer process or commonly termed lithographic process is used mainly for transferring a photomask pattern on a resist material on a semiconductor wafer.With a recent trend for finer semiconductor device structures, it is becoming more and more difficult to obtain a fine pattern with a desired resolution. As an example, the prior art photomask has a problem that the resist pattern size obtained by transfer is not in accord with a fine mask pattern size and is smaller than a desired value. Accordingly, in the prior art the mask pattern size is set to be greater than the resist pattern size that is obtainable by the transfer. Further, to solve the above problem and for the purpose of resolution improvement, investigations have been conducted about making shorter the wavelength of light of exposing in exposure apparatus used in the lithographic process, phase shifting masks for shifting the light phase, a shape change illumination process, in which the shape of a light source is changed, a pupil filter process, in which a filter is provided in an emission pupil in condenser lens system, and a FLEX process, in which exposing is done a plurality of times at different focus positions.A general example of the prior art method will now be given. Fig. 1 is a graph illustrating the concept underlying the prior art method example. In this method, the transfer resist pattern size is determined by experiments or simulation with a plurality of different defocus values, thus obtaining a mask pattern size versus defocus curve

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a photomask having a transmitting area and a shielding area:

- said transmitting area and said shielding area forming a mask pattern,
- said mask pattern having a mask pattern size specified by a linewidth or a contact hole size,
- said mask pattern size fluctuating as a consequence of fluctuations in the mask production process;
- from said mask pattern being obtained transfer patterns on a resist material on a semiconductor device by use of a lithographic process,
- in said lithographic process exposing steps being done at a focus position and an exposure dose,

wherein designing said photomask comprises the steps of

setting a plurality of combinations of defocus and mask pattern size values in predetermined ranges of a defocus latitude (III) and a mask pattern size latitude (II), obtaining transfer patterns by varying the exposure dose, and checking whether the transfer patterns meet a transfer pattern tolerance condition, thereby obtaining the exposure dose latitude (I) as the range of exposure dose meeting the transfer pattern tolerance condition in all the predetermined ranges of the defocus latitude and the mask pattern size latitude, wherein:

a mask parameter which is chosen from the following mask parameters:

the shape of the mask pattern, the mask pattern size, the transmissivity and shape of the transmitting area, and the phase difference between light shielding and transmitting areas,
is set for maximizing the obtained exposure dose latitude.
