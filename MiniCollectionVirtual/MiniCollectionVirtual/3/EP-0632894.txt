<ABSTRACT>
A method for modifying a liquid assay reagent to provide prolonged homogeneity thereof, particularly where the liquid assay reagent comprises microparticles for performing a heterogeneous immunoassay, is provided wherein the addition of an inert material to a liquid assay reagent achieves neutral density to thereby prolong the homogeneity thereof for extended periods of time. A method for the automated agitation of assay reagents to maintain the homogeneity thereof with an automated, continuous and random access analytical instrument is also provided. The automated mixing is accomplished by a back and forth motion of a carousel onto which assay reagent containers or packs are mounted with asymmetric pauses which can be completed within a short period of time. The carousel acceleration, velocity, distance moved, and pause-asymmetry are optimized to provide rapid assay reagent resuspension without foaming or bubble formation. Accordingly, periodic removal of assay reagent packs by an operator in order to mix the reagents is not necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The
present invention relates to methods for maintaining the
homogeniety of assay reagents and use thereof for the
analysis of a test sample.In order to meet the growing demands of the modern
clinical laboratory to provide cost effective services, the use
of automated clinical analyzers has increased. Reliance on
automated clinical analyzers improves the efficiency of the
laboratory procedures inasmuch as the technician has fewer
tasks to performed. Automated clinical analyzers provide
results much more rapidly while frequently avoiding operator
or technician error, thus placing emphasis an accuracy and
repeatability of a variety of tests.Generally, analysis of a test sample involves the
reaction of test samples with one or more reagents with
respect to one or more analytes wherein it is frequently
desired that the analysis be performed on a selective basis
with respect to each test sample. Typically, such analysis
involves forming a reaction mixture comprising the test
sample and one or more assay reagents, and the reaction
mixture is then analyzed by an apparatus as described above
for one or more characteristics of the test sample.Automated clinical analyzers are presently available for
automatically performing such analyses of a test sample.
Such analyzers typically include transport systems such as 
conveyor systems and carousels designed to transport
containers of sample liquids between various operating
stations. For example, a reaction tube or cuvette containing a
test sample may pass through a reagent filling station, mixing
station, reaction forming station, detection stations, analysis
stations, and the like. In particular, various automated
immunoassay analyzers have been provided such as the Abbott
IMx® analyzer and the Abbott TDx® analyzer (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA), often referred to as
batch analyzers, which utilize procedures involving a variety
of different assay steps which typically rely on detection and
measurement of optical changes in a reaction mixture during
the assay process. Random access analyzers have also been
described which not only can analyze multiple test samples,
but multiple analytes may be analyzed from each test sample.
In addition, presently available sequential and random access
analyzers include various reagents within the apparatus itself
or placed near the apparatus for pipetting purposes. Liquid
reagents, in bulk form, are selected for the various types of
tests which are to be performed on the test sample, and are
stored in or near the
