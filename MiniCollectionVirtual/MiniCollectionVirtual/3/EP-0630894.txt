<ABSTRACT>
A novel propenoic acid derivative which exhibits 
adenosine A1 antagonism is defined by the general 

formula (I): 

(wherein A represents an aromatic ring; R¹ represents 
aryl or the like; R², R³ and R⁴ each represent 

hydrogen, lower alkyl or the like; and R⁷ and R⁸ each 
represent lower alkyl or the like)

 
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a propenoic acid 
derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable salt 
thereof which is useful as a drug. More particularly, 
it relates to a propenoic acid derivative or a 
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof which 
exhibits adenosine antagonism. A syndrome having oliguria, anuria, uremia and so 
forth as the main sign is called acute renal failure, 
which began to attract attention during the Second 
World War because it attacked people which had 
recovered from traumatic shock due to the air raid on 
London, and has come to the present state. Although there are many causes of acure renal 
failure, it is believed that such failure is mainly 
caused by hemorrhage due to injury, surgical 
operation, aortic rupture or the like; diarrhea due to 
serious enteritis, infection with Salmonella or 
cholera, or the like; loss of water and/or electrolyte 
due to burn, continued vomiting, heat stroke or the 
like; hemolysis due to incompatible blood transfusion, 
hemoglobinuria or the like; angiopathy such as renal  
 
arterial thrombosis; infectious disease such as 
pneumonia, sepsis, acute hepatitis, pyelonephritis or 
candidiasis; allergy; anaphylaxis; influence of a 
carcinostatic agent such as cisplatin; urethral or 
ureteral obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy or 
malignant tumor; urinary obstruction such as ureteral 
stone; or the like. Further, a symptom of irreversible decrease in 
the number of nephrons is called chronic renal 
failure, and a patient with this failure cannot avoid 
dialysis with an advance in the symptom, suffering 
from physical and mental great agony. Additionally, 
the dialysis of a patient with chronic renal failure 
generally extends over a long period, so that his 
expense is also great. Further, it is apparent from 
the ratio of the number of dialyzers held in Japan to 
that of the patients necessitating dialysis that the 
dialyzers must now be worked without intermisission. 
Therefore, the fact that there are patients with 
serious acute renal failure who necessitate dialysis 
temporarily in addition to those with chronic renal 
failure is significantly problematic. Under these circumstances, the prevention of the 
symptom of renal failure from reaching a stage 
necessitating dialysis has become a great issue.  
 
However, there has not been found as yet any means 
which is effective in the prevention of the symptom of 
chronic renal failure from reaching such a stage, 
while the regulation of the body fluid which has lost 
its balance
