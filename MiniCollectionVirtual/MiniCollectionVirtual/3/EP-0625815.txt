<ABSTRACT>
A motor driven power door control system for 
a vehicle door includes a door position sensor that 

generates a door position signal for each 
predetermined distance of door movement so that the 

period of the door position signal is a measure of 
door speed. The motor control voltage is variably 

controlled to a controlled value to establish the door 
speed at a desired speed value. A door position 

signal period stall time is determined that is a 
predetermined function of the controlled value of the 

motor control voltage so that the stall time is 
adapted to the motor torque. An obstructive load is 

indicated when the period of the door position signal 
exceeds the stall time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of an 
electrically driven door on a motor vehicle and 
specifically to the control of the door when an 
obstructive resistance is encountered. Electrically driven doors on a vehicle are 
generally known. For example, it is known to provide 
an electrically powered sliding door for a van in 
which the door is opened and closed by operation of an 
electric motor. In these systems it is typical to 
provide for stopping or reversing the door when the 
door encounters an obstructive resistance as the door 
is being powered open or closed. It is desirable to 
provide a control in response to an obstructive 
resistance that responds to low obstruction load 
values while at the same time not responding to 
excessively low obstruction load resistances at low 
motor torque conditions. It is the general object of this invention 
to provide for an improved control of an electric 
motor powered vehicle door when the door encounters an 
obstructive resistance in which the obstructive load 
required to initiate door reversal or to terminate 
powered movement of the door is maintained within 
predetermined limits and in which the control does not 
respond to excessively low obstructive load 
conditions. A vehicle door controller in accordance with 
the present invention is characterised by the features 
specified in Claim 1. In accordance with the general principles of 
this invention, a door position sensor generates a 
door position signal for each predetermined distance 
of door movement so that the period of the door 
position signal is a measure of door speed. The motor  
 
control voltage is variably controlled to a controlled 
value to establish the door speed at a desired speed 
value. A door position signal period stall time is 
determined that is a predetermined function of the 
controlled value of the motor control voltage so that 
the stall time is adapted to the motor torque. An 
obstructive load is indicated when the period of the 
door position signal exceeds the stall time. In one aspect of the present invention, the 
predetermined function is an inverse function so that 
the stall time varies in an inverse relation to the 
value of the motor control voltage and therefore the 
motor torque. In yet another aspect of the present 
invention the motor control voltage is a pulse width 
modulated signal whose duty cycle is adjusted to 
establish the door speed. The stall time is 
determined as an inverse function of the duty cycle so 
that the stall times associated with

door (12) moveable between an open position and a 

closed position, the vehicle door controller 
comprising an electric motor (108) for driving the 

vehicle door in opening and closing directions in 
response to a motor drive voltage; means (122,124) for 

generating a door position signal for each 
predetermined distance of door movement; means 

for determining a time PTIM between each position 
signal, the time PTIM being a measure of door speed; 

means for variably controlling the motor

value; and means (608,650) for signalling a stall 

condition when the time PTIM exceeds the determined 
stall time. 
A vehicle door controller as claimed in 
Claim 1, wherein the predetermined function is an 

inverse function so that the determined stall time 
varies in an inverse relation to the drive voltage 

value. 
A vehicle door controller as claimed in 
Claim 1 or Claim 2, further including means for 

controlling the motor drive voltage to drive the 
vehicle door (12) in the other one of the opening and 

closing directions in response to the signalled stall 
condition. 
A vehicle door controller as claimed in 
any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the motor drive 

voltage is a pulse width modulated voltage; and  
 

wherein the variably controlling means comprises means 
for controlling a duty cycle of the pulse width 

modulated voltage to a duty cycle value to establish 
the door speed at the desired speed value. 
A vehicle door controller as claimed in 
Claim 4, wherein the stall time determining means 

comprises means for determining a stall time offset 
having a value that varies in a predetermined inverse 

relationship to the controlled duty cycle value; and 
means for summing the stall time offset value and a 

last determined time PTIM, the sum comprising the 
stall time.
