<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a molding resin composition
which comprises polyimide resin as a principal component. More
particularly, the invention relates to a polyimide-based moulding resin
composition which comprises polyimide resin and polyether ketone
resin and/or polyester resin and is excellent in thermal resistance,
chemical resistance, mechanical strength and processability.Conventionally, polyimide has extremely outstanding thermal
resistance, is excellent in mechanical strength and dimensional
stability, and additionally has flame retardance and electrical
insulation property. Polyimide has hence been used in areas such as
electrical and electronic parts, space and aeronautic members, and
transportation equipment. In the future, it is expected that the use
of polyimide will be extended to areas where thermal resistance is
required. Various kinds of polyimide which exhibit excellent
properties have been developed.Although polyimide is excellent in thermal resistance, means
such as sinter moulding is generally required in the case of using
polyimide as a moulding material. Even though polyimide is
thermoplastic and melt-moldable, processing under high temperature
and high pressure is required in many cases. When polyimide is 
processed under such high temperature and pressure, polyimide is,
though excellent in thermal resistance, thermally deteriorated or
oxidized which decreases mechanical strength and which makes moulding
of thin-walled articles difficult.Some kinds of polyimide have slow rates of crystallization in
the processing stage and moulded articles can be obtained in an
amorphous state. Even though heat treatment is carried out in order
to enhance the crystallinity of such polyimides, dimensional changes
resulting from crystallization have led severe restrictions on the
application of such polyimides to areas such as precision parts.On the other hand, when processability is improved, the
polyimide has a lowered glass transition temperature and is soluble
in halogenated hydrocarbons. That is, the polyimide has decreased
performance in view of thermal and solvent resistances. Consequently,
conventionally proposed polyimides have both merits and drawbacks,
and, it has been desired to accomplish further improvement.The present inventors have also found a novel polyimide resin
having recurring units represented by the formula (I):

wherein X is a direct bond, divalent hydrocarbon having from 1 to 10
carbon atoms, hexafluorinated isopropylidene, carbonyl, thio or
sulfonyl; Y1, Y2, Y3
