<ABSTRACT>
In the control method, the desired beat-up distance is varied with the effect of a lengthening or shortening, in order to avoid start-up points, for example thick and/or thin places, so that fabric, for example terry or plain fabric, with a programmed weft density is produced.

Method for the avoidance of stop marks in the fabric in a loom having
a reed, which is set to a target beat-up distance, characterized in

that the reed stop is so controlled that the target beat-up distance is
altered in the sense of a shortening or lengthening, in order to avoid

stop marks, for example thick and/or thin places.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that, in the
case of a stop event of the loom, a first beat-up distance VD
max
 is
set, as a function of a signal, in order to prevent contact of the reed

or of a partial weft with the previously correctly inserted weft thread,
in that, during restarting of the loom, a second beat-up distance

VD
1
, AD
1
 is set, and in that at least one correction process is carried
out in order to return the second beat-up distance to the target

beat-up distance.
Method in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that the setting
of the first beat-up distance is initiated directly by a mispick signal.
Method in accordance with claim 2,characterized in that the setting
of the first beat-up distance is initiated by an error signal or a signal

which occurs before the reed reaches the full beat-up position a
further time.
Method in accordance with claim 2, wherein the weft threads are
beaten up in groups, characterized in that the second beat-up distance

is set for each weft thread. 
Method in accordance with claim 5, wherein the group is beaten up
by at least two partial beats and one full beat, characterized in that

a correction process is associated to each of the two beat types, the
correction processes being independent of one another.
Method in accordance with one of the claims 5 or 6, characterized in
that the correction process includes at least one correction step.
Method in accordance with claim 7, characterized in that the correction
process includes several equal or unequal correction steps.
Method in accordance with claim 2, wherein at least one empty pick
is inserted, characterized in that the first beat-up distance is retained.
Method in accordance with claim 2, wherein at least one empty pick
and, following this, individual wefts are inserted in the sense of the

continuation of the weaving process, characterized in that the first
beat-up distance is retained during the insertion of the empty pick,

and the second beat-up distance is set during the insertion of the
individual wefts.
