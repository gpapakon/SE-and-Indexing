<ABSTRACT>
A row decoder that includes circuitry to provide a self-timed 
bootstrap signal. The self-timed bootstrap signal 

(BEBAR) is generated in response to the selection of the 
row decoder. At the same time, a capacitive device (89) is 

charged in order to bootstrap a word line. The self-timed 
bootstrap signal (BEBAR) causes a clock generator circuit 

to output a clock signal (1) that will be used to 
bootstrap the word line. The self-timed bootstrap signal 

(BEBAR) may be generated by other row decoders. The 
generation of the self-timed bootstrap signal (BEBAR) by a 

row decoder is responsive to any variations in that 
decoder, thus always providing an accurate and precise 

timing of the clock signal (1) to be used for the 
bootstrapping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an address decoder and
more particularly to a DRAM row decoder with self-timed
bootstrapping capabilities.Typical DRAMs (dynamic random access memories) have active
cycles which include access cycles for accessing the memory
cells and restore cycles for restoring data read from the
memory cells. Following the active cycles, typically
precharge cycles occur to precharge the bit and word lines
of the memory array for the next active cycle. Row
decoders generally provide the circuitry to precharge the
word lines and to drive the word line voltages to access
and restore addressed memory cells.A typical memory cell configuration is shown in Fig. 1. A
bit line 10 is coupled to a drain electrode of a transistor
12, illustratively an n-channel, enhancement mode field
effect transistor. A gate electrode of transistor 12 is
coupled to or formed by part of a word line 14. A source
electrode of transistor 12 is coupled to one terminal of a
capacitor 16. Another terminal of capacitor 16 is coupled
to a constant voltage, VCP. Bit line 10 is typically
coupled to a sense amplifier circuit (not shown). Word
line 14 is typically coupled to a row decoder (not shown).
Generally, an array of such cells is provided.Capacitor 16 typically is charged to VCC to store a logical
"one" and 0V for a logical "zero." To read from capacitor
16, bit line 10 is typically precharged to ½VCC and word
line 14 must be driven to a voltage greater than a
threshold voltage above either the voltage stored in
capacitor 16 or the precharge voltage of bit line 10,
whichever is lower. VCP is typically ½ VCC.Considering a DRAM having a 5V power supply VCC, for
example, if a "zero" (0V) is stored in capacitor 16, word 
line 14 must be driven to at least one threshold voltage (≈
1V) to turn transistor 12 on. If a "one" is stored in
capacitor 16 (5V), then the word line 14 must be driven to
at least one threshold voltage greater than the precharge
voltage of bit line 10. If bit line 10 is precharged to
2.5V (½VCC), then the word line should typically be charged
to approximately 3.5V.After the memory cell is accessed and read, the data will
be restored. In this case, word line 14 will be driven to
a voltage that is at least one threshold voltage greater
than VCC (5V) to allow a full VCC (5V) to be stored in
capacitor 16 from bit line 10. Providing a voltage that is
greater than the chip power supply is commonly done by the
"bootstrapping" technique, well-known to the art.Typically, when a 5V DRAM is in an active cycle,
