<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool consisting of a tool
holder and a replaceable cutting insert mounted therein to be used in rotary
machining operations. The present invention is particularly concerned with
tools such as for use in milling and drilling, in particular, end milling and
drilling for profile machining of shaped surfaces, narrow slots, rounded
grooves or corners, curved three-dimensional surfaces, etc. and to inserts for
use in such tools.A cutting tool of the kind to which the present invention refers
comprises a tool holder having an insert receiving slot and a cutting insert,
e.g. of a ball-ended type, replaceably mounted therein. In view of the
substantially circular shape of the cutting edge of such an insert in the tool
the cutting force components acting on the cutting edge are of relatively
great value and the tool has to be designed so as to ensure that position of
the insert in the tool holder is effectively and accurately fixed and that the
cutting insert itself is of sufficient strength. Tools of such a kind are disclosed, for example, in E.P. 216064
and U.S. 4,566,828. Thus, a metal cutting tool disclosed in U.S. 4,566,828
consists of a tool holder having a pair of clamping jaws defining therebetween
an insert receiving slot and a replaceable disk-like cutting insert
mounted in the slot. The insert is secured in the holder by means of a
clamping screw penetrating through screw bores formed respectively in the
jaws and in a body of the insert. In order to replace the cutting insert the
clamping screw has to be completely screwed out of the cutting tool,
rendering such replacement operation time consuming. Furthermore, where
the cutting insert is relatively small, as is the cutting tool, such manner of
clamping has disadvantages connected with the necessity of forming in such
small cutting insert a screw receiving bore, which, on the one hand, limits
manufacturing possibilities for such inserts and, on the other hand weakens
the insert.GB-A-2 082 102, on which is based the preamble of claims 1 and 5, discloses a milling
tool wherein the recess of the cutting insert (Fig 6) is disposed adjacent the insert
trailing edge.It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved
cutting tool, wherein a cutting insert is mounted in a tool holder in a new,
effective manner enabling an easy and quick replacement of the insert in the
tool, and an insert particularly suitable for such a tool especially for profile
machining of shaped surfaces.This object is solved with
