<ABSTRACT>
A fluid delivery system is provided to deliver precise volumes 
of a plurality of fluids in sequence to one or more treatment 

reservoirs. Fluid channels are formed in a plate structure to provide 
a means for delivering fluids from a plurality of fluid reservoirs to 

one or a plurality of treatment reservoirs. Each fluid is delivered by 
a system comprising a pneumatically or electrically activated inlet 

valve in fluid communication with a fluid reservoir, a positive 
displacement pump in fluid communication with the inlet valve and 

a pneumatically or electrically activated outlet valve in fluid 
communication with the positive displacement pump.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid delivery system for delivering
a plurality of fluids, in sequence to one or more treatment reservoirs.Prior to the present invention, fluid delivery systems have
been available which minimize intermixing of fluids while delivering
a precise amount of a fluid for chemical reaction. These systems are
generally utilized for chemical processes involving a large number of
sequentially effected chemical reactions such as in protein synthesis,
DNA synthesis or when sequencing proteins.US-A-4,008,736 discloses a valve block containing a
capillary formed of capillary segments bored at about 30Â° from a
contact surface of the block. The junctions of the capillary segments
are effected at the contact surface and within the block. The
junctions at the contact surfaces form valving sites to which are
engaged apertured sliding blocks which effect fluid communication
with the capillary. While the sliding blocks are effective in providing
the desired fluid flow, they wear too rapidly thereby causing
undesirable leaks.US-A-4,168,724 discloses a similar device but replaces the
slider valves with diaphragm valves. The fluid is delivered through
the valves from a pressurized fluid storage source. This system
requires a vacuum assist to open the valves. This system is
undesirable because the type of diaphragm valve used is undesirably
susceptible to particulate contamination. In addition, the pressure
drop through the valves is difficult to control which causes less
accurate reagent delivery. US-A-4,558, 845 discloses a fluid delivery system utilizing
a valve block assembly comprising a separate block for each valve
site. The common conduit to the reaction site is alternately a channel
in a block and tubing connecting two adjacent blocks. This
arrangement requires a plurality of fittings which are subject to
leaking.US-A-4,773,446 discloses a valve block assembly which
utilizes diaphragm valves. The valves serve to control fluid flow from
a plurality of pressurized fluid reservoirs, in sequence to a common
outlet reservoir. This system requires the use of conduits from the
fluid reservoirs and fittings to valve blocks for each conduit.The fluid delivery system of the prior art depend upon the use
of positive pressure to deliver the fluid and upon the control of back
pressure to the fluid reservoir in order to precisely control the
amount of fluid delivered to a treatment reservoir. These systems
require the frequent adjustment of the fluid delivery means as a
function of back pressure. All
