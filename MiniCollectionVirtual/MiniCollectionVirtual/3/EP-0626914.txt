<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of a 
tandem brake booster utilizing a commonized rear shell, 
control valve and a rear wall made by modifying a 
separation wall of a single brake booster. Single vacuum brake boosters such as disclosed 
in U.S. Patent 4,970,939 have a movable wall with a 
central hub for retaining a control valve. The control 
valve controls the creation of a pressure differential to 
develop an output force corresponding to an input force 
applied by an operator. This type vacuum brake booster 
is adequate for most applications, however, under some 
circumstances a greater output force is necessary to 
effect a brake application within set specifications or 
standards. In order to increase the output of a single 
vacuum brake booster, a method is disclosed in U.S. 
Patents 3,146,682; 3,289,547; 3,517,588 and 5,076,142 for 
dividing the interior of a housing into front and rear 
chambers by a partition to create a tandem brake booster 
which has an output force of approximate double that of a 
single vacuum brake booster. In such tandem vacuum brake 
boosters, a first wall on one side of the partition is 
secured to a second wall on the other side of the 
partition. Various passageways through the walls connect 
the front and rear chambers such that the front and the 
rear chambers are connected together at all times while a 
control valve carried by the second wall selectively 
controls the communication of fluid to the second chamber 
to create the operational pressure differential. The 
operational pressure differential acts on the first and 
second walls to produce an output force which is 
approximately double that of a single vacuum booster. In 
all such tandem brake boosters, the first wall is 
connected to the second wall through a positive 
attachment such as bolts, a threaded connection or a 
series of hooks to assure that the first and second walls 
simultaneously move within the housing. In addition,  
 
while the control valve for a tandem brake booster may be 
identical to that used in a single brake booster, the 
second wall in which the control valve is retained can 
only be used in a tandem brake booster because the unique 
connection required to join the first and second walls. Commonalty of components for use in 
manufacturing a tandem brake booster is illustrated in 
U.S. Patent 3,813,992 wherein a pair of identical single 
brake boosters are joined together to develop an output 
force which is approximately double that of a single 
brake booster. In this
