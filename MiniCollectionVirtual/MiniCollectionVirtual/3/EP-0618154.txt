<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an interchangeable, tiltable, stackable container (1) for differently flowable particulate materials like rubble or refuse. On one end face of the container (1) a closable flap (5) and/or door (16) is provided, fastened to the container base (12) in a manner flush with the latter. The container (1) is to be designed so that different refuse components can be separately received by it and yet jointly transported. For this purpose, according to the invention the interior (2) of the container (1) is subdivided into at least two chambers (3) by at least one separately closable separating device (4) which can be moved out of and into the closed position, in which chambers the different components can be separately received, but jointly transported.

Exchangeable, tiltable, stackable transport container for differently flowable 
and/or dumpable material like rumble, waste and the like with a flap (4) closing a 

first front side (3) of the transport container and/or door, bounding flush against 
the bottom (6) of the transport container and with at least one cover closing the 

interior space of the transport container,
characterized thereby
 
that the interior space (2) of the transport container (1) is divided into at least 

two chambers (3) by at least one separately lockable separating device (4) 
which is movable from the and into the locking position, in which device (4) the 

components of the different flowable and /or dumpable material can be 
separately collected, but jointly transported and that on the outer surface (14) of 

the at least one cover (13) for the stacking of a further transport container (1) 
receiving elements (15) are provided for in form of longitudinal rails running 

parallel to the axis, which form a roller track for the transport container to be 
stacked, which roller track is equipped with a locking at its end. 
Transport container according to claim 1, 
characterized thereby
, that a variety of 
covers (13) covering the chambers (3) is provided for, on the outer surface (14) 

of which the receiving elements (15) in form of the longitudinal rails running 
parallel to the axis are provided for. 
Transport container according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized thereby
, that the 
separately lockable separating device (4) is a slewable flap or door. 
Transport container according to claim 1 to 3, 
characterized thereby
, that the 
flap (4) is displaceable for the variation of the volumes of the chambers (3) in the 

axial direction running towards the end flap (5) on the face of the transport 
container (1). 
Transport container according to claim 4, 
characterized thereby
, that the 
displaceable flap (4) which separates the chambers (3) is movably placed in 

sliding rails (8) provided for parallel to the axis at the inside (6) of the side walls 
(7) of the transport container (1).  

 
Transport container according to claim 5, 
characterized thereby
, that the sliding 
rails (8) are designed as square profiles with a slot (17) running in longitudinal 

direction at the lower surface (9), in which slots one slide (10) each is movably 
held, at which a slewable mechanism (11) each is fixed provided for at the flap 

(4). 
Transport container according to claim 1 and 6, 
characterized thereby
, that at 
the bottom (12) of the transport container (1) flap locking elements are provided 

for in axial direction which are arranged with interspacing.
