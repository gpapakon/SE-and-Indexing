<ABSTRACT>
An oscillation detector circuit detects an 
oscillating condition of a resonant light deflector having a 

reflecting mirror, and applies an oscillating condition 
signal to a reference signal generator, which generates a 

reference signal. An auxiliary scanning feed motor for 
feeding a scanned medium in an auxiliary scanning direction 

is controlled by the reference signal to adjust the speed at 
which the scanned medium is fed in the auxiliary scanning 

direction, depending on the oscillating condition of the 
resonant light deflector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning device
according to the preamble of claim 1 for recording data on and
reading data from a scanned medium.A scanning device according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from US 4926263.Laser beam printers for recording an image or the
like by deflecting a laser beam at high speed on a scanned
medium such as a photographic film are used in various
applications. The laser beam may be deflected at high speed
by a resonant light deflector which comprises a reflecting
mirror supported by a resilient member and is oscillatable at
its natural frequency. A printer of this kind is disclosed in US4992655.Because the natural frequency of the resilient
member varies with temperature, the resonant light deflector
has a resonant frequency as shown in FIG. 2 of the
accompanying drawings. The temperature of the resonant
light deflector varies with an ambient temperature and due
to the heat produced thereby. The resonant frequency of the
resonant light deflector cannot be adjusted since it is
based on the natural frequency of the resilient member. There is known a scanning device in which an image
is recorded on a scanned medium such as a photographic film
using such a resonant light deflector. If a scanned medium
is fed in an auxiliary scanning direction at a constant
speed in such a scanning device, the scanning pitch in the
auxiliary scanning direction is varied by a change in the
frequency of the resonant light deflector, resulting in
irregularities in the recorded image. To alleviate such a
drawback, it has been proposed to oscillate the resonant
light deflector for a certain period of time without
recording any image after the scanning device has been
started, or to preheat the resonant light deflector until it
is kept at a constant temperature for thereby stabilizing
the resonant frequency.However, these proposals make the scanning device
inefficient since no recording process can be carried out
until the resonant frequency is stabilized. In addition,
the attempts fail to avoid irregularities which are produced
in the recorded image due to temperature changes while the
scanning device is in recording operation.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a scanning device
which is capable of stably scanning a scanned medium without
disturbing the scanning pitch of a light beam even when the
scanning speed of the light deflector fluctuates, 
and of starting a desired scanning process immediately after
the scanning device is started, for thereby allowing
