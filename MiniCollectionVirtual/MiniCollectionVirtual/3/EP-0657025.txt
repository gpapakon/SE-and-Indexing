<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a counterflow leak-detector unit (1) with an inlet (2) to which a test specimen, or a chamber housing a test specimen, is connected and with a test-gas detector (3) to which is connected a high-vacuum pump (4) which produces the necessary pressure in the detector, the inlet (2) to the leak-detector unit being connected to an intermediate line (16) in the high-vacuum pump (4). In order to increase detection sensitivity without any danger of the pressure in the detector rising to inadmissible levels, the invention proposes that a constriction (17) is located between the two high-vacuum pump stages (5, 6) separated by the intermediatge line (16) and that the inlet (2) to the leak-detector unit is connected to the outlet side of the high-vacuum pump stage (5) at a point upstream of the constriction (17).
