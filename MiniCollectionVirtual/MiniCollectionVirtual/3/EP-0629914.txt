fresh water, and one or a plurality of processing units 
(2) each comprising a pair of feed rollers (3, 3') 

disposed with their circumferences in close contact with 
each other, a pair of delivery rollers (3, 3') spaced 

apart from the pair of feed rollers (3, 3') and disposed 
with their circumferences in close contact with each 

other, a pair of sealing rollers (4, 4') disposed with 
the circumference of one of them in close contact with 

the circumferences of the top feed roller (3) and the 
top delivery roller (3) and with the circumference of 

the other in close contact with the circumferences of 
the bottom feed roller (3') and the bottom delivery 

roller (3'), and a pair of support plates (5, 5') 
disposed respectively on the opposite sides of the 

rollers (3, 3', 4, 4') so as to support the rollers (3, 
3', 4, 4') for rotation and to define a liquid-tight 

processing chamber by the circumferences of the rollers 
(3, 3', 4 and 4') and the inner surfaces thereof. The 

processing unit or units are immersed completely in 
fresh water contained in the water tank, and a  

 
processing liquid is circulated through each processing

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic 
film processing apparatus for processing medical, 
industrial and general-purpose photographic film, radiographic 
films, or printing paper. Generally, in a dental clinic or research laboratory, 
an exposed photographic film or radiographic film 
(hereinafter referred to simply as "film") is immersed in a 
developing solution contained in a processing container for 
developing, the developed film is transferred from the 
processing container through the air to another processing 
container containing a fixing solution for fixing 
or the film is immersed in a developing-and-fixing 
solution contained in a processing container for 
developing and fixing. When a large number of films are 
processed at a time or the developing process is 
performed frequently, the processing solution are 
contained respectively in processing tanks each having a  
 
comparatively large capacity and provided with conveying 
means, such as conveyor rollers, and films are fed 
successively to the processing containers for continuous 
developing. The deteriorated developing solution and 
the fixing solution (hereinafter referred to inclusively 
"processing liquids") deteriorated due to repeated use 
for developing and fixing are disposed of after being 
diluted and neutralized according to relevant laws and 
regulations. Generally, the processing container or the 
processing tank for containing the processing liquid is 
opened to the atmosphere to feed a film into and to take 
out the same from the container or the tank. 
Accordingly, the characteristics of the processing 
liquid deteriorate as the same is used repeatedly and 
deteriorate naturally with time due to oxidation by air 
that occurs in the surface of the processing liquid. 
Furthermore, there is the possibility that the 
processing liquid wetting the surfaces of the 
components, such as the conveyor rollers, of the 
processing apparatus dries and solidifies in particles 
or crystals, and the particles or crystals damage the 
film.  
 Accordingly, when processing a film by a 
conventional photographic film processing method that 
passes the film through processing containers or 
processing tanks containing processing liquids, the 
characteristics of the processing liquids must be 
controlled continuously to replenish the processing 
containers with the processing liquids or to change the 
processing liquids at appropriate time, and the 
components of the processing apparatus in contact with 
the processing liquids must
