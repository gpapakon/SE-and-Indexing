<CLAIMS>
One-piece holding element (1), made of plastic, 
in particular for at least one pipe, having at least one 

supporting region (2) and at least one holding region (3, 
4) for partially surrounding the pipe circumference, the 

supporting region (2) being arranged between two holding 
regions via resilient webs, and the two holding regions 

(3, 4) being connected to form a basic body (10), characterized 
in that the basic body (10) encloses a gap (8) 

inside which the supporting region (2) is arranged and is 
connected to the basic body (10) via at least one resilient 

web (5, 5', 5"). 
Holding element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the supporting region (2) is of cylindrical 

configuration. 
Holding element according to either of Claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that three resilient webs (5, 5', 

5"), distributed over the circumference, connect the 
basic body (10) to the supporting region (2). 
Holding element according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the webs (5, 5', 5") extend 

diagonally through the gap (8) between the basic body 
(10) and the supporting region (2). 
Holding element according to Claim 4, having a 
supporting region which is open on one side, characterized 

in that the webs (5, 5', 5") extend from one end 
(12) of the supporting region (2) through the gap (8) to 

the diagonally opposite side of the basic body (10). 
Holding element according to one of the preceding 
claims, each holding region comprising two shell-like 

holders with an inner shell partially surrounding the  
 

pipe circumference and an outer shell surrounding the 
inner shell with a clearance, characterized in that each 

holding region (3, 4) has on the inside a cut-out (23, 
23') bounded by a wall (25, 25'), and in that the two 

walls (25, 25') are connected to one another via connecting 
regions (27, 28) and enclose the gap (8) inside 

which the supporting region (2) is arranged. 
Holding element according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the supporting region (2) 

has, on the inside, longitudinal ribs distributed over 
the circumference, consists of a profiled bolt (35) or 

has elastic wings (32, 33).
