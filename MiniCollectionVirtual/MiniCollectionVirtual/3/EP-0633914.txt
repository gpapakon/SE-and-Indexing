<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous inks for ink jet
printers, and, more particularly, to aqueous, colored
inks containing penetrants.Ink jet printing is a non-impact method for
recording information in response to an electronic
signal, such as that generated by a computer. In the
printer the electronic signal produces droplets of ink
that are deposited on a substrate such as paper or
transparent film. Ink jet printers have found broad
commercial acceptance due to their reliability,
relatively quiet operation, graphic capability, print
quality and low cost. Thermal or bubble jet drop-on-demand
printers have been especially successful and have
found broad application as output for personal computers
in the office and the home.Both dyes and pigments have been used as ink
colorants for ink jet printers. However, dyes have
several disadvantages. They are water-soluble and
remain so after drying. They are redissolved by contact
with water and will run when exposed to a water spill.
Also dye images smear on contact with felt pen markers.
In addition they exhibit poor light stability relative
to pigments and are known to fade even under conditions
of office fluorescent lighting. Thus, there are several
disadvantages with the use of dye-based ink jet inks,
many of which prohibit their use in applications
requiring moisture resistance and greater light
stability. Pigments can be used as ink colorants for
ink jet printers. Pigment-based inks contain cosolvents 
which provide improved water and smear resistance and
improved lightfastness compared to dyes. However, the
presence of these cosolvents which include penetrants
also tends to destabilize pigment dispersions. Thus,
pigments are a useful alternative to dyes provided the
pigment dispersions can be made stable to flocculation
and settling.Three major concerns dominate ink jet ink
technology. They are (1) the drying rate, (2) print
quality, and (3) reliability. Drying rate determines
the throughput rate and therefore productivity.One major deficiency of thermal ink jet printers is
their relatively slow printing speed compared to
printers using competing technologies. A major obstacle
is the ink drying rate. In a sheet fed printer, the ink
must be dry before the succeeding sheet contacts it or
the ink will smear.Drying occurs by both evaporation and penetration.
Evaporation is determined by solvent vapor pressure
whereas penetration is determined by interfacial energy
between the ink and the paper and the porosity of the
print media. The use of penetrants is
