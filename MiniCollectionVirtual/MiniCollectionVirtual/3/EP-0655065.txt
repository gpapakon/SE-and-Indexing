<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a compound of formula I, which is named 
27-hydroxyrapamycin, and derivatives thereof and a method for using them for 
inducing immunosuppression, and in the treatment of transplantation rejection, host vs. 
graft disease, autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation, solid tumors, fungal 
infections, and hyperproliferative vascular disorders. Rapamycin is a macrocyclic triene antibiotic produced by Streptomyces 
hygroscopicus, which was found to have antifungal activity, particularly against 
Candida albicans, both invitro and invivo [C. Vezina et al., J. Antibiot. 28, 721 
(1975); S.N. Sehgal et al., J. Antibiot. 28, 727 (1975); H. A. Baker et al., J. Antibiot. 
31, 539 (1978); U.S. Patent 3,929,992; and U.S. Patent 3,993,749]. Rapamycin alone (U.S. Patent 4,885,171) or in combination with picibanil 
(U.S. Patent 4,401,653) has been shown to have antitumor activity. R. Martel et al. 
[Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 55, 48 (1977)] disclosed that rapamycin is effective in 
the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model, a model for multiple sclerosis; in the 
adjuvant arthritis model, a model for rheumatoid arthritis; and effectively inhibited the 
formation of IgE-like antibodies. The immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin have been disclosed in FASEB 3, 
3411 (1989). Cyclosporin A and FK-506, other macrocyclic molecules, also have 
been shown to be effective as immunosuppressive agents, therefore useful in 
preventing transplant rejection [FASEB 3, 3411 (1989); FASEB 3, 5256 (1989); R. 
Y. Calne et al., Lancet 1183 (1978); and U.S. Patent 5,100,899]. Rapamycin has also been shown to be useful in preventing or treating systemic 
lupus erythematosus [U.S. Patent 5,078,999], pulmonary inflammation [U.S. Patent 
5,080,899], insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [Fifth Int. Conf. Inflamm. Res. Assoc. 
121 (Abstract), (1990)], and smooth muscle cell proliferation and intimal thickening 
following vascular injury [Morris, R. J. Heart Lung Transplant 11 (pt. 2): 197 (1992)]. Mono- and diacylated derivatives of rapamycin (esterified at the 28 and 43 
positions) have been shown to be useful as antifungal agents (U.S. Patent 4,316,885) 
and used to make water soluble prodrugs of rapamycin (U.S. Patent 4,650,803). 
Recently, the numbering convention for rapamycin has been changed; therefore 
according to Chemical Abstracts nomenclature, the esters described above would be at  
 
the 31- and 42- positions. Under the older numbering convention, 
27-hydroxyrapamycin would be named as
