<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a foot prosthesis comprising a support part and a foot element cooperating with the support part, characterized in that the said foot element comprises a forefoot part which is arranged in such a way that it can be displaced in the axial direction along the support part, and a heel part which is fixed on the lower end of the support part, and in that a setting arrangement is provided for setting the position of the forefoot part along the support part in relation to the heel part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a foot prosthesis
comprising a support part and a foot element cooperating
with the support part.Foot prostheses of different types are known.
Prostheses are usually designed in such a way that an
ordinary shoe can be used on top of the prosthesis. At a
defined heel height, for which the setting has been made
upon production of the individually adapted prosthesis,
the prosthesis is considered easy to walk on and to load,
but without a shoe, or at another heel height, the
prosthesis is no longer comfortable to use, since the
angle of the foot in relation to the ground surface is no
longer correct.The most common solutions to the above problem
are either to angle the whole foot prosthesis downwards/forwards
or to lower the heel part when, for example, it
is desired to walk without a shoe. Angling the prosthesis
downwards does not produce an anatomically correct
shaping of the foot, i.e. the type of foot setting which
is required when using a higher heel is not obtained, and
if, alternatively, the heel section is lowered, this
results instead in a lengthening of the leg, which will
cause discomfort, particularly in the back.SE-B-8504225-5 describes a foot prosthesis having
a central part, which supports the sole, heel and leg
part. In this prosthesis the heel is movably arranged in
relation to the central part of the prosthesis and to
that part of the sole of the foot which is joined in a
fixed manner to the central part. Movement of the heel is
obtained by virtue of the fact that the latter is coupled
together with the rear area of the central part by means
of a bar which can be locked in a hole in the said area
and is joined to the heel, which bar, in the unlocked
position, can be displaced in relation to the central
part for the purpose of setting the heel in relation to
the sole of the foot. In this arrangement the lengthening
of the leg results from the fact that the heel is lowered 
in relation to a reference point, for example the knee of
the user.WO 91/15171 describes a foot prosthesis having a
foot plate and a hollow cylindrical body, which is angled
in relation to the foot plate and secured thereon in such
a way that mutual relative movement is permitted. The
foot also comprises a support which is displaceably and
adjustably arranged in the upper part of the cylindrical
body and secured on the foot plate at the lower end of
the body in such a way that a relative movement can take
place between the support and the foot plate. In this
case too adjustment of the prosthesis

<CLAIMS>
Foot prosthesis comprising a support part (1)
having a longitudinal axial direction and

a foot element cooperating with the support part
said foot element comprising a fore-foot part (2), and a heel

part (3) which is fixed on the lower end of the support part
(1), characterized

in that the fore-foot
part (2) is arranged in such a way that it can

be displaced in the axial direction along the support
part (1),

and in that a setting
arrangement (10, 100, 300) is provided for setting the

position of the forefoot part along the support part in
relation to the heel part.
Foot prosthesis according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the setting arrangement (10) comprises

operating mechanisms (11, 12, 101, 20) for altering the
displacement of the forefoot part (2) along the support

part (1), stops (17, 17', 104; 15) for limiting the
displacement of the forefoot part (2) along the support

part (1), and retention means (18) for holding the
forefoot part (2) in the set position.
Foot prosthesis according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a guide part (6, 6') is arranged

essentially parallel to the longitudinal extension of the
support part (1), the said guide part (6, 6') being

joined between an attachment element (15) of the heel
part connected in a fixed manner to the support part and

a displaceable attachment element (4) of the forefoot
part, and a torsional movement being possible between the

said attachment elements round the support part (1).
Foot prosthesis according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the said guide part (6'), which joins the

said attachment elements to each other, consists of a
threaded rod.
Foot prosthesis according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the said setting arrangement (100, 300)

is arranged on one of the said attachment elements and is
actively connected to the said rod (6') in order to

effect the displacement of the forefoot part along the
support part. 
Foot prosthesis according to any one of Claims 2
to 5, characterized in that the retention means (18) are

arranged in connection with the support part (1) or the
guide part (6).
Foot prosthesis according to either of Claims 5
or 6, characterized in that the retention means consist

of at least one spring (18).
Foot prosthesis according to any one of Claims
5, 6 or 7, characterized in that the operating mechanism

comprises a wire (11) and a position-fixing part (12).
Foot prosthesis according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the heel part (3)

is arranged in such a way that it constitutes an extension
of the support part (1).
Foot prosthesis according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that elements (19) are

provided for altering the angle of the contact surface of
the heel part in relation to the ground surface and the

support part (1), and also for altering the rigidity of
the heel part (3). 
Foot prosthesis according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the setting
arrangement for setting the position of the forefoot part along the support part

comprises a motor (20), preferably arranged in the support part (1), the movement of
which is translated into movement of the forefoot part (2) along said support part (1).
Foot prosthesis according to Claim 11, 
characterized
 in that retention means
for holding the forefoot part in the set position consist of self-locking characteristics in the

construction and said motor (20).
