<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (1) for feeding a machine which processes printed sheets (2), such as a saddle-stitcher, an insertion machine or a collating machine, comprises a feeder (3), which separates the printed sheets (2) from a stack (4), and a conveying device (17) which is arranged downstream of said feeder and communicates with the processing machine, there being arranged, between the feeder (3) and the conveying device (17), designed as a transporter, a conveying member which is driven in rotation approximately in the same direction and in synchronism with said feeder and conveying device, in the region where it approaches the same, which is provided with actuable drivers, and of which the conveying region has assigned to it, in an optionally switchable manner, a supplement-supplying device (18) and/or a printing device (24).

Apparatus (1) for feeding a printed sheet (2) processing machine, such as a gang-stitcher, 
inserting machine or gathering machine, consisting of a feeder (3) 

separating the printed sheets (2) from a stack and a conveying device (17) 
arranged downstream of the latter and communicating with the processing 

machine, characterised in that a conveying element (8) is arranged between the 
feeder (3) and the conveying device (17) in the form of a conveyor, said conveying 

element being driven continuously substantially in the same direction as and in 
synchronisation with the latter in the immediate vicinity thereof and being provided 

with grippers (10) capable of being actuated, an inserting device (18) and/or a 
printing device (24) being selectively connectable in its effective conveying region. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the printed sheets (2) are fed 
to a conveying drum (8) having an axis of rotation (9) perpendicular to the 

conveying direction, to the effective conveying circumference of which grippers in 
the form of controllable gripping elements (10) associated with the fold of the 

printed sheets (2) and the conveyor serving as the conveying device (17) are 
secured at regular intervals and that the printed sheets (2) are guided flat along the 

circumference of the conveying drum (8) upstream of the transition region to the 
conveyor (17). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that a guiding device (15) is 
arranged upstream of the transition region to the conveyor (17) in the effective 

conveying region of the conveying drum (8) and is directed towards the latter. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the conveying drum (8) has a 
push-off device (25) effective in the transition region to the conveying device (17), 

which can be controlled to lift the printed sheets at one end from the circumference 
of the conveying drum (8), corresponds to the gripping tongs (28) of the conveyor 

(17) and acts on the ends of the printed sheets downstream of the conveying drum 
(8).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that a holding-up device (31) 
acting on the printed sheets (2) upstream of the lifted end towards the 

circumference is associated with the transition region to the conveying device (17). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that the undershot conveying 
region of the conveying drum (8) is designed to receive the printed sheets (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the push-off device (25) has 
a plurality of pusher devices (27) associated with the adjacent printed sheets (2), 

which are each connected to a lever (26) and can be moved into a position 
projecting beyond the circumference in the transition region to the conveying 

device (17). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the guiding device (15) is 
formed by means of at least one guide belt surrounding the conveying drum (8) at 

least approximately over the length of the conveying region and driven in the same 
direction and at the same speed, or is a stationary guide element (16) arranged at a 

distance from the circumference of the drum. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in that the pusher devices (27) are 
arranged between two guide belts so that they project beyond the circumference of 

the conveying drum (8). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the inserting device (18) is a 
feeder (19) for inserts (23) which can be glued on to the printed sheets (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterised in that the inserts (23) are glued on 
to the printed sheets (2) bearing against the circumference of the conveying drum 

(8) by means of a rolling movement of the feeder (19) provided with a drum. 
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterised in that the feeder (19) has a plastic 
applicator (20) along the conveying path of the inserts (23). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that the push-off device (25) is 
secured to a support arranged concentrically with the axis of rotation (9) of the 

conveying drum (8) and rotatable relative to the latter.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that the gripping tongs (28) have 
an upstream rigid gripping tongs part (29) extending into the immediate vicinity of 

the conveying drum (8) and a downstream movable gripping tongs part (30). 
Apparatus according to claim 14, characterised in that the rigid gripping tongs part 
(29) forms a bent-over edge cooperating with the downstream pusher device (27) 

of the push-off device (25).
