<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus for recording an image on a recording medium
on the basis of input data.A laser beam printer is widely known in which a
latent image is formed on a rotary drum by scanning a
laser beam using a rotary polygon mirror or the like and
is transferred onto a paper sheet after it is developed,
thereby recording an image.Fig. 1 shows an arrangement of a conventional laser
beam printer, and a description will be made below with
reference to Fig. 1.In Fig. 1, a paper cassette 702 stores paper sheets
701 as recording media. Uppermost one of the paper
sheets 701 in the cassette 702 is separated by a sheet
feed cam 703, so that its leading edge portion is fed to
sheet feed rollers 704 and 704'. The cam 703 is
intermittently rotated every sheet feed operation. A
reflection type photo-sensor 718 detects light reflected
by the sheet 701 through a hole 719 formed in the bottom
portion of the paper cassette 702 to detect the
presence/absence of paper sheets. When the paper sheet 701 is fed to a gap portion
between the sheet feed rollers 704 and 704' by the sheet
feed cam 703, the rollers 704 and 704' are rotated while
lightly pressing the paper sheet 701 to feed the sheet
701. When the sheet 701 is fed and its leading edge
reaches a position of a registration shutter 705, the
paper sheet 701 is stopped by the registration shutter
705, and the sheet feed rollers 704 and 704' are kept
rotated while slipping on the 
paper sheet 701 to generate a feed torque. In this
case, when a registration solenoid 706 is driven to
release the registration shutter 705 upward, the paper
sheet 701 is fed to convey rollers 707 and 707'. The
registration shutter 705 is driven in synchronism with
a given timing of an image formed by focusing a laser
beam 720 on a photosensitive drum 711. A photo-sensor
721 detects whether or not the paper sheet is present
at the position of the registration shutter 705.A rotary polygon mirror 75 is driven by a polygon
mirror motor 753, and guides the beam 720 from a
semiconductor laser 751 onto the photosensitive drum
711 via a reflection mirror 754, thereby forming a
recording image on the photosensitive drum 711. A beam
detector 755 arranged at a scan start position of the
beam 720 detects the beam 720 to output a known BD
signal which defines an image write timing in a main
scan direction.Thereafter, the paper sheet gains a feed torque by
the convey rollers 707 and 707' in place of the sheet
feed rollers 704 and 704', and is fed to the
photosensitiv

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus (700) having means (752,
753, 756) for scanning a photosensitive body (711) with

light modulated by image data and means (766) for
controlling relative scanning speed between the light and

the body to vary recording solution in accordance with
a resolution setting command sent from an image data

source,

   characterised in that

   said image forming apparatus invalidates the
resolution setting command which is sent from the image

data source during a period when said image forming
apparatus is in an on-print state.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the on-print
state comprises either the state where the light is

exposing the photosensitive body, or the state where a
document sheet is being fed in said image forming

apparatus, or the state where the feeding motor or the
photosensitive body is being driven.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, and
further comprising means (755, 791) for generating a beam

detector signal (BD) for performing synchronisation of
the scanning of the photosensitive body by the modulated

light. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said scanning means comprises deflecting means for

deflecting the light beams when it has been modulated by
the image data and means for rotating said photosensitive

body, and wherein the recording resolution is changed by
adjusting the deflection speed of said deflecting means.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein said scanning means comprises deflecting means

for deflecting the light beam when modulated by the image
data and means for rotating said photosensitive body, and
