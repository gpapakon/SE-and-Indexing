<ABSTRACT>
The invention features novel derivatives of K-252a, as well as novel bis-N-substituted derivatives of staurosporine. Also, a method for treating diseased neuronal cells involving the administration of either the novel staurosporine derivatives or specified functional derivatives of K-252a.

<DESCRIPTION>
Protein kinases are a broad class of enzymes which 
act to modify chemically many cellular proteins, by 
phosphorylation of amino acids. Inhibitors of protein kinases are structurally 
varied, and have variable (and sometimes contradictory) 
effects on the nervous system and other tissues. A given 
protein kinase inhibitor may influence more than one 
protein kinase. For example, K-252a, an alkaloid-like 
material isolated from the culture broth of Nocardiopsis 
sp. and Actinomadula sp. was originally reported to be a 
protein kinase C inhibitor, but was subsequently found 
also to inhibit protein kinases A and G, myosin light-chain 
kinase, and trk (a tyrosine kinase activated by 
nerve growth factor [NGF], the latter a neurotrophic 
protein which promotes the survival of peripheral, 
sensory and sympathetic neurons). Consistent with this 
latter effect, K-252a blocks the neurotrophic actions of 
NGF on PC-12 cells (chromaffin cells from rat adrenal 
medullary tumors, pheochromocytomas), and promotes the 
survival of dorsal root ganglion neurons and hippocampal 
neurons. However, it has been found to be cytotoxic at a 
wide range of concentrations, leading some investigators 
to conclude that it has limited usefulness in vivo. A microbial alkaloid related to K-252a, 
staurosporine, also has a variety of effects on different 
protein kinases and cell types. Staurosporine was found 
to have NGF-like effects on PC-12 cells, and to protect 
the gerbil hippocampus from post-ischemic injury. It is 
able to reverse damage to cholinergic neurons in the rat 
basal forebrain. K-252a and staurosporine have been proposed as 
tumor inhibitors. Staurosporine has been offered as an  
 
insecticide. Derivatives of staurosporine, with a 
hydrocarbyl or acyl substituent at the methylamine 
nitrogen, have been made and proposed for tumour 
inhibition, inflammation inhibition, immunomodulation, and 
treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular and central 
nervous systems. Nabeshima et al, The Journal and Exp. Therapeutics 
257:562-6 (1991), disclose that the use of stauroporine 
partially reverse reduced choline acetyltransferase 
activity. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
functional derivative of K-252a is used for the manufacture 
of a medicament for use in enhancing, in a mammal, the 
function of a cholinergic neuron. The functional 
derivatives used in this invention are the respective 
compounds, of formulae II, III and IV, defined in claim 1. According to a second aspect of the present invention,
