arranged in two-dimensional array in the directions 

of rows and columns. Each of the unit cells 1 has a 
photo detection element 3 and a column selection 

transistor 4. A plurality of signal readout lines 5 
run across the unit cells in the direction of rows. 

A column selection line 6 runs across the unit cells 
in the direction of columns to control a 

conductivity state of the column selection 
transistor 4. A first shift register 7 is connected 

with the column selection line 6. A charge 
integration capacitor 9 and a row selection 

transistor 11 are connected with the signal readout 
line 5 through a direct injection gate transistor 8. 

A second shift register 12 controls a conductivity 
state of the row selection transistor 11. A reset 

transistor 14 charges the charge integration 
capacitor 9. Exchange switches 10 switch by time 

division the plurality of the signal readout lines 5 
to a signal output line 13 for external output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
readout circuit and its drive circuit used for a
charge integration type two-dimensional array
photodetectors.A two-dimensional array infrared detector
comprises a photo detection section and a signal
readout section for reading out signals detected by
the photo detection section. A conventional line
integration type signal readout circuit generally
used as the signal readout section is shown in Fig.
3. GB-A-2 181 010 describes infrared imaging devices and discloses a circuit similar to the circuit shown in Fig. 3. The line integration signal readout circuit shown in Fig. 3
comprises a focal plane array 1 in which unit cells
2 are arranged in row and column directions, that
is, in a two-dimensional array state. Each of the
unit cells 2 has a photo detection element 3 and a
column selection transistor 4. A signal readout
line 5 and a column selection line 6 run across the
unit cell in the row and the column directions,
respectively. The column selection transistor 4 is
placed between the photo detection element 3 and the
signal readout line 5, and the conductivity state at 
each column is determined by the column selection
line 6 connected to the output of an X-shift
register 7.The signal readout line 5 is connected to a
signal output line 13 through a direct injection
gate transistor (hereinafter referred to as "DIG
transistor") 8 and a row selection transistor 11.
The signal readout line 5 is connected with a charge
integration capacitor 9, and the row selection
transistor 11 is connected with a Y-shift register
12.Signal detection operation is performed in a
cycle for each column, the cycle consisting of
integration, readout and reset processes (the time
for these processes being defined as 1H). The
shifting time of output pulses from the X-shift
register 7 corresponds to the above-mentioned 1H.
The signal detection operation, i.e., the
integration, readout and reset processes, of the
unit cell will be described below.When any one of the column selection line 6 is
selected by the X-shift register 7, that is, when
the column selection transistor 4 of any one of the 
columns is in conductivity state, the photo
detection element 3 of the column is electrically
connected with the signal readout line 5. In this
state, the photo detection element 3, column
selection transistor 4, DIG transistor 8, and charge
integration capacitor 9 constitute a series circuit,
and the charge previously stored in the charge
integration capacitor 9 is discharged via the DIG
transistor
