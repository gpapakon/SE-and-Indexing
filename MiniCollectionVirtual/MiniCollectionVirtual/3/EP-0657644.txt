<ABSTRACT>
Fuel injection device for internal combustion engines with a high pressure accumulator (9), fillable by a high pressure fuel pump (1), from which accumulator high pressure lines (13) lead off to the individual injection valves (15). At the same time control valves (17) are inserted in the individual high pressure lines (13) in order to control the high pressure injection to the injection valves (15), together with an additional pressure reservoir (19) between the said control valves (17) and the high pressure accumulator (9). For more rapid pressure relief of the injection valve (15) at the end of injection, the valve element (21) of the control valve (17) has a return flow flange (53) which, for maintaining a residual pressure in the pressure line (61) to the injection valve (15), in addition forms a restrictor (55) which is connected to the inlet side of the flat seat valve (45, 47) opening the connection of the injection valve (15) to a relief chamber (65).

Fuel injection device for internal combustion
engines, with a fuel high-pressure pump (1) which

conveys fuel out of a low-pressure space (5) into a
high-pressure collecting space (9) which is connected,

via high-pressure conduits (13), to injection valves
(15) which project into the combustion space of the

internal combustion engine to be supplied and the
opening and closing movement of which is controlled in

each case by an electrically activated control valve
(17) arranged in the high-pressure conduit (13) on the

injection valve (15), the control valve (17) having a
piston-shaped valve member (21) with two valve sealing

surfaces which face one another and co-operate with two
valve seats and of which a first valve sealing surface

(37) opens the connection of the high-pressure conduit
(13) to the injection valve (15) and a second valve

sealing surface (45) opens the connection of the
injection valve (15) to a relief space (65),

characterized in that the second valve sealing surface
(45) is preceded by a return collar (53) which is

located on the valve member (21) and which, when the
second valve sealing surface (45) lifts off from its

seat (47) at the end of injection, exposes a return
volume, into which part of the fuel quantity located

upstream of the injection valve (15) expands.
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the circumferential surface of

the return collar (53) has only slight clearance in 
relation to the wall of a guide bore (43) guiding the

valve member (21) and thus forms a throttle (55)
preceding the valve seat (47) co-operating with the

second valve sealing surface (45).
Fuel injection device according to Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the first valve sealing

surface on the valve member is designed as a conical
valve sealing surface (37) which seals at the outer

cone diameter and which co-operates with a conical
valve seat (39) formed on the guide bore (43).
Fuel injection device according to Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the second valve sealing

surface on the valve member (21) is designed as a flat
valve sealing surface (45) which is arranged on an

axial annular surface of an annular web (49) delimiting
the valve member (21), the said annular surface facing

the conical valve sealing surface (37), and which
co-operates with a flat valve seat (47) which is formed

on a shoulder of the guide bore (43).
Fuel injection device according to Claims 3 and
4, characterized in that a first annular groove (51) is

provided between the return collar (53) and the annular
web (49) and a second annular groove (59) is provided

between the conical valve sealing surface (37) and the
return collar (53).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 3,
characterized in that a guide-piston part (41), which

slides sealingly in the guide bore (43), adjoins that
side of the conical valve sealing surface (37) which

faces away from the conical valve seat (39).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the conical valve seat (39) is

adjacent, at its larger diameter, to a pressure space
(63) which surrounds the guide-piston part (41) and

into which the high-pressure conduit (13) opens.
Fuel injection device according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the conical valve seat (39) is

adjacent, at its smaller diameter, to an annular space
(57) which is formed between the second annular groove 

(59) and the wall of the guide bore (43) and from which
a pressure conduit (61) leads away to the injection

valve (15) and which is delimited at its other end by
the return collar (53).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the flat valve seat (47) is

adjacent, on its side facing away from the annular
space (57), to a relief space (65), from which a

return-flow conduit (73) leads away to the low-pressure
space (5).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the stroke movement of the valve

member (21) is delimited by the bearing of the valve
sealing surfaces (37, 45) on one of the valve seats

(39, 47).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the individual components of the

valve member (21) are connected, by means of a screw
(29) projecting into an axial blind-hole bore in the

valve member (21), to an armature plate (27) of an
operating magnet (25) which actuates the control valve

(17).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a further pressure accumulator

space (19) is provided, on each injection valve (15),
in the respective high-pressure conduits (13) between

the high-pressure collecting space (9) and the control

Fuel injection device according to Claim 7,
characterized in that an annular shoulder (91) is

return collar (53) results in an annular throttle gap
