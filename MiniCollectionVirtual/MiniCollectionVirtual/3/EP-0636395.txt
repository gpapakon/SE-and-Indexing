<ABSTRACT>
The invention with the title "toy flying body (propeller kite) with propellers rotating in opposite directions" relates to a novel structural principle for kites. The bearing surfaces of the kite substantially consist of at least two axially rotating propellers (1, 2), wherein an oblique position of bearing surfaces or parts of bearing surfaces in the wind is obtained as a result of the flexibility of the rods fixed to the axis of rotation or as a result of the distortion of wing surfaces. According to the invention, a particularly stable flying performance is achieved, with a correspondingly designed kite, in that propellers with opposite directions of rotation are used.
