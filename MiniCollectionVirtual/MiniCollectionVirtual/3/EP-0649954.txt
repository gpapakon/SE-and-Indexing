<ABSTRACT>
A fencing section comprising a rod panel (1) which is attached in 
the edge zone on both sides to an adjacent post (10) in a number 

of attachment points by means of an attachment device (40). Such 
a device has a frontal part and a side part containing a 

horizontal groove wherein a horizontally extending section of 
the mesh panel runs. For a first part number the groove is 

located in the upper surface of the device, and for the other 
part number in the lower surface of the device. The device 

has a stud in its frontal part which fits into an opening in 
a frontal vane of the post. In at least one of the two part 

numbers, the device is elastically deformable. Such a fencing 
section is easy to assemble and extremely difficult to 

dismantle by vandalism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fencing section comprising a rod 
panel having, at each of the vertical sides thereof, an edge 
rod with a vertical course, and further comprising at each of 
both vertical side edges, an adjoining fence post to which the 
corresponding side edge is attached. Such a section can of 
itself be used to close something, but generally constitutes 
part of a fence consisting of a row of posts arranged with a 
rod panel mounted between every two posts. A "fencing section" 
here is regarded as being the rod panel element with the posts 
on both sides, irrespective of whether it constitutes part of 
a larger whole or forms an independent unit: The rod panel is a grille of metal rods arranged in a mesh 
structure, not necessarily in the same plane, but with mesh 
dimensions which are small enough and metal rods which are 
thick enough, taking account of the mesh width, to induce 
sufficient rigidity and strength in the whole structure, so 
that, at any rate, they cannot be deformed with the naked hand, 
for example comprising drawn steel wires with a round section 
and a thickness of between 3 and 8 millimetres. The rods are 
strongly attached to each other at the intersections of the 
mesh, preferably by means of welding, and the whole is preferably 
coated with a corrosion-resistant plastic such as PVC or 
nylon. Fences with rod panels are often used in cases where vandalism 
is possible. It is therefore necessary to pay special attention 
to ensuring that the panels are extremely firmly attached to 
the posts and are difficult to dismantle, at least from one 
side, namely the side from which the vandalism is expected. 
Thus one side of the section will be regarded as the "front 
side" and the means of attachment will be structured thereon in 
such a way that it is difficult to dismantle, at least from 
that front side. The front side thus chosen then defines the  
 
terms "front" and "rear" for the entire structure as described 
hereinafter. In a known embodiment in accordance with FR 2.641.306, each of 
the vertical side edges of the rod panel is attached in a 
number of attachment points at various heights on the post. The 
attachment at each of these points is formed by a frontal (i.e. 
parallel with the panel) plate-shaped vane which constitutes 
part of the post and against the rear side of which the adjacent 
vertical side edge of the rod panel rests, and by an 
attachment device mounted on that vane. In such attachment 
device, a frontal part rests with its rear side against

<CLAIMS>
Fencing section comprising : 
   a rod panel (1) having, at each of the vertical sides 

thereof, an edge rod (16, 17) with a vertical 
course, and further, 

   at each of both vertical side edges, an adjoining 
fencing post (10) to which the corresponding side 

edge is attached in a number of attachment points 
(13, 14, 15) at various heights on this post, 

where the attachement in each (13) of these 
points is formed 

   by a frontal plate-shaped vane (12) which 
constitutes part of the post (10) and 

against the rear side of which the adjacent 
vertical side edge of the rod panel (1) 

rests, 
   and by an attachment device (40), mounted on 

the said vane (12), the frontal part of 
said attachment device resting with its 

rear side (43) against the front side of 
the vane (12), and a side part (42) 

extending backwards past the side edge (38) 
of the vane (12) and containing a 

horizontal groove (44) in which a rod 
section (18) runs that extends horizontally 

towards the said edge rod (16), 
   and where for a first part number (13, 14) of the 

aforementioned number of attachment points 
(13, 14, 15) said groove (44) is located in 

the upper surface of the side part (42), and 
for the remaining second part number (15) is 

located on the lower surface,
 

   characterized in 
   that the attachment device (40), in each of the said 

number of attachment points (13, 14, 15), 
   has a shape that can be slipped frontally onto 

the vane (12) without panel, 
   and has a protruding stud (45) on the said rear 

side (43) of its frontal part (41) which fits 
without play in an opening (46) in the vane 

(12), 
   and that, for at least one of the two part numbers, 

the attachment device (40) is elastically 
deformable, whereby the insertion thereof onto the 

vane (12), with panel, includes an elastic 
deformation of the attachment device (40). 
Fencing section according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least in the remaining second part number (15), 

the attachment device (40) is elastically deformable, and 
whereby this part is equal to one. 
Fencing section according to one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that the attachment devices (40) in all 

attachment points (13, 14, 15, respectively 23, 24, 25) 
have the same shape and are elastically deformable. 
Fencing section according to one of the foregoing claims,

of all attachments of a vertical side to the same post 
(10) are formed by one single common vertical strip-formed 

vane (12), behind which the adjacent vertical side 
edge of the rod panel (1) runs. 
Fencing section according to claim 4, adjoining a second 
similar section, whereby the rod panels (1, respectively 

2) lie in the prolongation of each other, and the adjacent 
vertical side edges of both panels are attached to

two adjoining vanes (21, 22) lie in the prolongation of 

each other, and the attachment points of both adjoining 
vertical side edges are located in pairs (23 and 33 ; 24 

and 34 ; 25 and 35) two by two at different heights on 
the post (20), where the attachment device (55) for each

Fencing section according to one or the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that one (44) or more of the said 

grooves are provided with an U-shaped closing piece (50)

hook system (51, 52) in a direction perpendicular to the 
groove (44) and towards the groove for the closure 

thereof, and which, in both senses in the direction of
