<ABSTRACT>
When the use permission information detecting unit
detects the restrictive use permission information, the time

shift start information, and the time shift end information
from a reproduced video signal S6 supplied thereto, the use

permission information detecting unit forms a use prohibition
control signal S7 and supplies it to the use prohibition

processing unit. The use prohibition processing unit erases
the video signal recorded on a recording medium, on which the

restrictive use permission information is add, in accordance
with the use prohibition control signal S7 and the like, and

makes it impossible to use the video signal repeatedly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for restricting
repeated reproduction of an information signal recorded on a
recording medium, and the device of the same.Accompanied with widespread of video tape recorders
(hereunder, referred to as VTR), plenty of software that VTRs
can reproduce has been provided. Recently, a digital VTR and a
reproducing or recording/reproducing device of a DVD (digital
video disc) have been available, and it becomes easy to enjoy
to reproduce videos and sounds of a high picture and sound
quality.On the other hand, however, there is a risk that the
affluently supplied software is duplicated without restriction.
Accordingly, a measure has been taken to prevent a duplication,
in which a duplication prevention control is carried out by
adding a duplication prevention control signal to control 
prohibition, permission, or generation restriction of
a duplication on an information signal.Fig. 1 illustrates a basic construction of a
recording/reproducing device that deals with a video
signal from a VTR, etc., on which a duplication
prevention control signal is added, as the information
signal. The recording/reproducing device shown in Fig.
1 is supplied with a video signal S11 on which a
duplication prevention control signal reproduced, for
example, by a reproducing VTR is added.The video signal S11 having the duplication
prevention control signal added thereon is supplied to
a writing unit 11 and a duplication prevention control
signal detecting unit 12. The writing unit 11 converts
the video signal S11 into a video signal S12 for recording
so as to record it on a recording medium. The writing
unit 11 is controlled by a writing control signal S14
from a writing control unit 13.The duplication prevention control signal
detecting unit 12 detects a duplication prevention
control signal added on the video signal S11. Here, the
duplication prevention control signal detected is
supplied to the writing control unit 13 as a duplication
prevention control signal S13. The writing control unit 13 generates the writing
control signal S14 on the basis of the duplication
prevention control signal S13 supplied thereto, and
controls the writing of the video signal S11 by supplying
the writing control signal S14 to the writing unit 11.The writing unit 11 is designed to write the video
signal S11 supplied in a recording medium 100 if the
writing control signal S14 from the writing control unit
13 indicates permission of a duplication, and not to
write the video signal S11 in the recording medium 100

A method of restricting reproduction of an information signal, comprising the
steps of:


storing an information signal (S2) on which reproduction restricting information
is added,
reproducing the stored information signal (S5),
detecting the reproduction restricting information of said information signal, and
restricting repeated reproduction of the stored information signal (S2), in

accordance with the detection of the reproduction restricting information, 
characterised
in that
 repeated reproduction of the information signal (S5) is restricted by modifying
the stored information signal (S2) to disable normal reproduction thereof.
A method according to claim 1, wherein identification information (TC) for
indicating reproduction of specified information is added to the stored information

signal, and is detected on reproduction.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the identification information (TC) is
added at a specified position of the information signal.
A method according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the identification information (TC)
comprises first position information and second position information indicating that a

specified length of interval is read out, which are added at separate positions in time of
the information signal (S2).
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein normal
reproduction of the information signal is disabled by erasing at least a part of the stored

information signal (S2). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the information signal
(S2) is a video signal, and normal reproduction of the information signal (S2) is disabled

by modifying the stored information signal (S2) to make it difficult to view on
reproduction.
An information signal reproducing device comprising:

information signal storing means (1, 100) to store an information signal (S2) on
which reproduction restricting information is added,
reproduction means (4) to reproduce the stored information signal (S2),
detection means (5) to detect the reproduction restricting information of said

information signal (S2), and
reproduction restricting means (6) to restrict repeated reproduction of the stored
information signal (S2), in accordance with the detection of the reproduction restricting

information in said detection means (5), 
characterised in that
 repeated reproduction of
the stored information signal (S2) is restricted by modifying the stored information

signal (S2) to disable normal reproduction of at least a part of the stored information
signal (S2) in the information signal storing means (1, 100).
An information signal reproducing device according to claim 7, wherein the
information signal storing means (1, 100) stores said information signal (S2) in which

identification information (TC) for indicating reproduction of specified information is
added, and said detection means (5) detects the identification information (TC) of said

information signal (S2).
An information signal reproducing device as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
identification information (TC) is added at one specified position of the information

signal (S2). 
An information signal reproducing device according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the
identification information (TC) comprises first position information and second position

information for indicating that a specified length of interval is read out, which are added
at separate positions in time of the information signal (S2).
An information signal reproducing device as claimed in any one of claims 7 to
10, wherein repeated reproduction of the information signal (S2) is restricted by erasing

at least a part of the stored information signal.
An information signal reproducing device as claimed in any one of claims 7 to
10, wherein the information signal (S2) is a video signal, and normal reproduction of the

information signal (S2) is disabled by making it difficult to view said video signal.
An information signal recording medium (100) on which a main information
signal and reproduction restricting information to restrict reproduction of said main

information signal are recorded, 
characterised in that
 said reproduction restricting
information comprises reproduction control signals to control reproduction of the main

restricted by modifying the stored information signal (S2) to disable normal

reproduction of at least a part of said stored main information signal.
An information signal recording medium according to claim 13, wherein
identification information (TC) is recorded therein to indicate that specified information

of the main information signal has been reproduced.
An information signal recording medium as claimed in claim 14, wherein the
identification information (TC) is recorded at one specified position of the information

signal (S2).
