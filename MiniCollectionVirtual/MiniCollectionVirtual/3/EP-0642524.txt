<ABSTRACT>
Systemin, an 18 amino acid peptide hormone and first polypeptide hormone found in plants, induces expression of defense genes in plants wounded mechanically or by predators including herbivores, insects, bacteria and viruses. The precursor for systemin is encoded as a 200 amino acid prosystemin molecule that has the systemin peptide sequence located near the carboxyl-terminus. Both a 951 bp cDNA for prosystemin and 4526 bp genomic DNA were cloned and the organization of the gene was determined. Transgenic plants constructed with antisense prosystemin DNA fail to mount a defensive response to wounding. Transgenic plants constructed with increased copy number of prosystemin genes exhibit increased resistance to wounding. Insect larval that feed on transgenic plants constructed with increased copy number of prosystemin genes exhibit decreased growth weight compared to larval that feed on wild type plants. A tomato systemin polypeptide has an amino acid sequence NH3-AVQSKPPSKRDPPKMQTD-COO-.

 SYSTEMIN GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIPThis invention was made with government support under grant number DCB9104542 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/855,412, filed March 19, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/528,956, filed May 25, 1990, and a continuation-in-part of US/91 /03685, filed May 24, 1991.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to methods and materials for inducing plant defense mechanisms. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for inducing the production of plant defense proteins, such as proteinase inhibitors, and to methods of regulating resistance to predators, herbivores, insect, pathogen or virus in plants by inducing or suppressing the expression of genes encoding systemin or prosystemin.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONDamage to crops by predators (i.e., insects, herbivores, and pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, and viruses), results in substantial annual losses in agricultural production. Man has created and employed a wide range of chemicals in attempting to reduce damage to plant crops. Many environmental problems have been created by the widespread use of chemicals that may only provide a transient level of protection for crops. Chemicals also suffer from the disadvantage that all organisms in an area may be indiscriminately treated, causing needless damage to many beneficial organisms. Many chemicals are also potentially toxic to man and animals.Attempts to reduce crop damage have included selective breeding for resistance, but resistance traits can frequently be controlled by many genes making it difficult (or impossible) to genetically select a desired attribute. Decreased crop yields are also commonly encountered in resistance strains. Accordingly, there exists a strong need for compositions and processes to improve the resistance of plants under attack by herbivores.Plants have evolved inducible defensive mechanisms that respond to attacks by predators (CA. Ryan, 1990, Ann. Rev. Phytopathol. 28:425; D.J. Bowles, 1990, Ann. 

Rev. Biochem, 59:873; M. Chessin and A.E. Zipf, 1990, Tbe -SofaÏ€/ca/ fle 'ew-' 56:193; D.L Dreyer and B.C. Campbell, 1987, Plant, Cell and Environ. 10:353). One mechanism involves systemic synthesis of serine proteinase inhibitors that are accumulated at distal tissue sites in plants. The proteinases can inhibit the digestive enzymes
