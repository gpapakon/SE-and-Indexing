<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended for adjusting the vacuum in an evacuated bottle (2) for suction drainage of wounds with a connecting piece (4) for a drainage line. For rapid adjustment of the desired vacuum in the bottle for suction drainage there is a valve body (3) with a valve (15, 16) which can be connected to a bottle for suction drainage, on the one hand, and to an adjustment device (5), on the other hand. The adjustment device comprises a pressure gauge (27) and is equipped with means which connect the valve (15, 16) to the pressure gauge (27) and selectively open the valve (15, 16).
