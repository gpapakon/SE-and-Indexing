<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for 
supplying steam into a silo via holes 

provided in the bottom (3) of the silo 
and via channels (8) provided below the 

silo. According to the invention, the 
steam supply channel (8) is provided with 

a feed connection through which the steam 
to be fed into the silo is passed into 

the steam supply channel (8). Furthermore, 
the channel (8) is provided with 

steam feed nozzles (17) placed under the 
holes in the bottom (3) of the silo. The 

nozzle (17) is preferably provided with a 
mounting flange (21) which is fastened to 

the lower part of the channel (8), making 
it easy to remove the nozzle (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for supplying 
steam into a silo, according to the preamble of claim 1. In pulp industry, the wood used as raw material is cut into 
chips as required for the production process. Besides external 
dimensions, the chips must be of the right quality with 
respect to other properties as well. The chips are conveyed 
into a steaming silo and from there further to the pulping 
process. In the silo, the moisture of the chips is adjusted 
to a suitable level by supplying steam into the silo. At the 
same time, the air among the chips, which is detrimental to 
the pulping process, is removed. In previously known technology, e.g. in EP-A-0 326 012, the steam is supplied to 
different parts of the silo through steam supply pipes. To 
ensure that all parts of the silo receive enough steam, the 
steam supply points must be distributed in different parts 
of the silo walls and bottom. Therefore, the piping contains 
several branching points and is a complex structure. The 
steam is fed into the silo through perforated plates mounted 
on the pipe ends at the supply points. These perforated 
plates are blocked at times by chips accumulating on them or 
by impurities entering with the steam. This applies especially 
to the steam supply points in the bottom of the silo. 
The cleaning and possible replacement of the piping and perforated 
plates is a time-consuming operation which generally 
makes it necessary to empty the silo. The object of the present invention is to achieve a new and 
simple steam supplying apparatus which ensures a reliable 
supply of steam into the silo and is easy to maintain. To 
implement this, the invention is characterized by the 
features defined in the characterization part of claim 1. 
Other embodiments of the invention are characterized by the 
features presented in the subclaims.  
 The solution of the invention obviates the need to build a 
complex pipework under the silo as the steam supply pipes 
proper are terminated at the edge of the silo, where one or 
two feed connections are provided. The steam is passed to 
different parts of the silo bottom via hollow beams fixed to 
the bottom and preferably forming its supporting structure. 
The nozzles can be easily installed and replaced afterwards. 
The nozzles may be standard components which are reliably 
positioned in correct locations. Removing impurities from 
the nozzles and perforated plates communicating with the 
silo space is simple and possible even when the silo 
contains chips. In

bottom, and which silo is provided with at least one steam 

supply channel (7,8) placed below the bottom (3), said 
channel having a top side facing the bottom (3) of the silo 

and a bottom side (15,26) below the top side, 
characterized
 
in that the steam supply channel (8) is provided with a feed 

connection (10) through which the steam to be supplied into 
the silo is passed into the steam supply channel (8), and 

that the steam supply channel (8) is provided with steam 
nozzles (17) placed under the holes (12) formed in the 

bottom (3) of the silo. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
steam nozzle (17) is a tubular body whose one end extends to 

the bottom (3) of the silo while the other end extends substantially 
to the bottom side (15,26) of the steam supply 

channel and that between the ends of the steam nozzle (17) 
there is a steam inlet hole (18) which opens into the steam 

supply channel (8). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the 
end of the steam nozzle (17) facing the bottom (3) of the 

silo is provided with a grating (16). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
