<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pillbox 
containing a card on which identification and health 
information of the owner are written. Pillboxes, small containers made of metal or other 
rigid materials provided with lids, are widely used 
especially by those who, over the course of the day or an 
equivalent period, must take more than one type of 
pharmaceutical in the form of capsules, pills and the like 
and, therefore, find it convenient to carry with them, 
instead of whole bottles or packages, only the necessary 
doses collected in a single container which provides 
adequate hygiene. This type of pillbox has been realized 
in a great number of forms and aesthetic variations. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
pillbox which, in addition to its natural function, also 
fulfills that of containing information on the identity 
and relative health information of its carrier. According to the invention, a pillbox is provided 
comprising an accessible compartment wherein a support 
element for identification and health information is 
housed. Preferably said compartment is formed in the lid 
of the pillbox. Alternatively it can be formed on the 
bottom of the pillbox and can, in particular, be 
accessible from the inside or outside of the same. In particular, said support element is a paper card. The invention will be made apparent in the following 
detailed description of one of its possible embodiments 
and some of its variations in execution, with reference to 
the attached drawings in which: 
figure 1 is a side view of the pillbox according 
to the invention in an open position; figure 2 is a plan view of the internal part of 
the lid of the pillbox of figure 1;  figure 3 is a diametrical sectional view of the 
lid of figure 2; figure 4 shows in a plan view the internal part of 
the lid of figure 2 with its movable septum removed. figure 5 shows schematically a first variation of 
the pillbox according to the invention; figure 6 is a top plan view of the internal part 
of the pillbox of figure 5; figure 7 is a second variation of the pillbox 
according to the invention; figure 8 shows the plane development of the two 
faces of the card containing the identification and health 
information suitable to be housed in the pillbox according 
to the invention. With reference to figures 1, 2, 3 and 4, 1 indicates 
a small cup, made of metal or another suitable rigid 
material, provided with a lid 2 which can be snapped shut 
on the cup and can be opened by means of a button 3 
provided on
