<ABSTRACT>
A torch (118) having a lamp (12), a pair of thermistors (134, 136) secured to the outer centre of the lamp (12) and connected to an electric circuit (10), the electric circuit (10) being arranged to switch off the power supply to lamp (12) of the torch (118) when the temperature at the thermistors (134, 136) reaches a pre-determined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
Improvements in or relating to Search Lamps and TorchesThis invention relates to search lamps and torches, hereinafter referred to as torches.In particular the invention relates to an improvement or modification in the torch described and claimed in our UK patent GB 2 222 449B the contents of which are hereby incorporated by way of reference. The torch in GB 2 222 449B is intended for use in situations where there are likely to be explosions due to for example leakages of gas or chemicals.If such a torch has its light output obscured, this obscuration can cause an undesirable temperature rise in the torch. Such a temperature rise may in certain circumstances cause hazard, fire, explosion or melting of torch components.In order to obtain BASEEFA approval for use in hazardous conditions or areas one requirement for approval is that if a torch has been covered so that its beam is obscured then the surface temperature of the torch must not rise above a pre¬ determined level, the level being determined by the specific application of the torch for which approval is sought. An obvious application is for use in mines or sewers where 

explosive gases or explosive mixtures of air and dust are present.The present invention seeks to overcome this problem by detecting when the light output from the torch is restricted, thus causing a rise in temperature.Accordingly the present invention provides a torch having means for detecting any obscuring of the light output from the torch which could cause a temperature rise in the torch and having means for switching off the power supply to the lamp of the torch.The detecting means can take a number of forms eg an appropriate sensor detecting the rise of temperature caused by the heating effect of the obscured beam and when the temperature reaches a pre-deter ined value, switching off the bulb power supply until the torch is cooled sufficiently so that it can be used safely again.The heat detector or sensor can be mounted in a suitable position in a torch and can cause the lamp to be switched off at a pre-set temperature eg by using a thermistor, a thermocouple, a thermopile, passive infra-red sensors, a heat expansion switch eg. aluminium bar and micro switch, a switching thermometer or any other temperature monitor can be 

used to switch off the torch at a pre-set temperature so that it will only be allowed to come on again at a pre-set lower temperature.The presence of any obscuring material that would be sufficient to cause an undue temperature rise can be detected by

Claims
1. A torch having means for detecting any obscuring of the light output from the torch to which could cause a temperature rise in the torch and means for switching off the supply to a bulb of the torch.
2. A torch as claimed in claim 1 having temperature sensing means and means to switch off the power supply to the bulb when the temperature reaches a pre-determined value.
3. A torch as claimed as claimed in claim 2 in which the heat detector or sensor is mounted in a appropriate position in the torch and causes the lamp to be switched off at a pre-set temperature for example by using a thermistor, a thermocouple, a thermopile, a passive infrared sensor, a heat expansion switch or a switching thermometer.
4. A torch as claimed in claim 1 in which the presence of any light obscuring matter is determined by detecting the change in electrical capacity at the lens of the torch caused by the presence of the obscuring material. 


A torch as claimed in claim 1 in which the presence of any obscuring material is detected by a change in the reflective value of the lens of the torch, for example by opto-electrical means or by measurement of the electro¬ static change caused by the obscuring material or by monitoring the actual light output of the torch and detecting any reduction caused by the obscuring material.
