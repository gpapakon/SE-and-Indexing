<ABSTRACT>
A digital readout dual pressure gage is disclosed which, for example, 
may be used in the medical field as a pressure gage for entdotracheal 

tube cuff gases and a pressure gauge for inspiratory pressure. However, 
the dual pressure gage of the present invention may be used in any 

application where positive and negative pressure with respect to 
atmospheric, is desired to be measured. The digital readout dual pressure 

gage of the present invention is a hand held device which comprises an 
automatic zero setting with respect to ambient atmospheric, a digital 

liquid crystal display, a low battery indicator, an over and under range 
indicator and an automatic pre-determined, pre-specified turn-off time.. 

The entire gage is controlled by an electronic circuit comprising a micro-machined 
silicon pressure sensor and an analog to digital signal 

processor, all powered by lithium batteries. The foregoing abstract is 
merely a resume of a general application and description of the principles 

of operation and application of the digital dual pressure gage of the 
present invention, and is not to be construed as a limitation on the scope 

of the claimed subject matter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a gas pressure gage. In the past, portable pressure gages have not been the most accurate 
instruments and very few portable gages have the ability to register both 
positive and negative gas pressures. Such gages that are digital have been 
used in the prior art, an example of such hand held digital gages is digital 
readout vehicle tire gage and others. A number of the gages use a load 
cell to develop a voltage proportional to the weight of an object. However, 
many of these digital readout gages are large, cumbersome and are 
often costly. Other digital readout gages pressure transducers or a variable 
electrode capacitor but all are relatively large and cumbersome and 
require excessive electrical energy to operate. It is, therefore highly desirable to develop a small compact, light weight, 
hand held, digital readout dual pressure gage that is highly accurate, 
presents a dual gas pressure (positive and negative) and still requires a 
minimum of electrical energy and saves energy when in use.  The following art has been found to be related to the field of the present 
invention but in no way do any of the herein cited references anticipates or 
even suggest the novel advance in the art that the present invention makes. U.S. Patent No. 3,886,473, issued to Heyck on May 27, 1975 entitled 
Capacitive Pressure and Displacement Transducers, which discloses a 
capacitive transducer for converting a small displacement of a mechanical 
input member into an electrical signal directly proportional to quantity 
being measured. The only similarity that Heyck has to the digital readout 
dual pressure gage of the present invention is that they both have a digital 
readout. U.S. Patent No. 3,762,223, issued to Feuer, et al.. on Oct. 2, 1973 entitled 
Digital Pressure Transducer, which discloses a device to measure fluid 
pressure which is applied differentially to a diaphragm, causing the 
diaphragm to vibrate at a natural frequency, and sensing the stressing of 
the diaphragm terms of the resulting change in the natural frequency. 
Again the only similarity that Feuer, etal. has to the digital readout dual 
pressure gage of the present invention is that they also both have a digital 
readout.  U.S. Patent No. 3,657,926, issued to Munson et al. on April 25, 1972, 
entitled Method and Apparatus for Measuring Physical Phenomena, 
which discloses a closed loop measuring system which includes a digital 
computer, which computer controls and monitors the establishment 
of
