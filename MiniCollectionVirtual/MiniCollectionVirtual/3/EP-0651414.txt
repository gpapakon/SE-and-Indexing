<ABSTRACT>
A base for a relay comprises a main body (1) which has a central boss (5) bearing 
a socket for receiving the pins of a relay. A module (6) has a central aperture (7) 

and is received within a recess surrounding the boss (5). The module (6) contains 
electronic circuits which are coupled to the main body (1) through complementary 

electrical coupling means (4). The aperture (7) is dimensioned to receive the boss 
(5) whilst allowing a relay to be plugged therein. 
In another embodiment, the module (6) is provided with raised portions for 
containing additional circuitry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base for a relay. There is a large variety of relays designed to perform different functions in 
existence on the market. From the point of view of their connection they are 
subdivided into two major groups: non-plug-in relays and plug-in relays. All relays have external terminals, connected internally to components of the relay, 
such as coils and contacts. It is generally accepted that the terminals connected 
to the coil are called "input terminals" while those connected to the contacts are 
called "output terminals" Non-plug-in relays are connected to the operating circuit by directly soldering their 
terminals to a printed circuit or circuit wiring. Plug-in relays are connected directly to bases equipped with terminals and terminal 
sockets, connected together within the base so that a connection is provided 
between the terminals of the relay and the terminals. There is a large variety of plug-in base, which correspond to different types of 
relays. Here we refer by way of example to a standard model general-purpose 
baseplate which can accept relays with eight or eleven pins, in a circular 
arrangement. Nevertheless its applications as explained below are also appropriate  
 
for models other than the one mentioned. Initially relays were used as simple electromechanical components, but since the 
appearance and development of control circuits containing semiconductors, relays 
have fulfilled a complementary purpose in these circuits and have to be capable of 
acting without causing damage to the associated semiconductors. For this purpose it is necessary that means of protection be provided in the coil and 
contact circuits in order to avoid transient overvoltage peaks or radiofrequency 
emissions which can effect behaviour or even destroy delicate electronic logic 
circuits. The trend in current technology with regard to the use of relays is to incorporate 
various electronic circuits within the relay itself or within its base to carry out the 
protective task described above, and also to incorporate more complex electronic 
circuits which control the operation of the relay in a specific way, such as delay 
circuits, sensor amplifiers, phase fault detectors and, in general, all types of logic 
circuits, so that the relay acts as a resulting output from this logic. All this diversity of electronic circuits offering this possibility is referred to below as 
"auxiliary circuits". There are three main ways of providing protection: 
1) Installing these components
