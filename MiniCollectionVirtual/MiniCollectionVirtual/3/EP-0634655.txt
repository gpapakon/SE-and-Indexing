<ABSTRACT>
Method making it possible to establish a diagnosis of the condition of a tree, of wood and of wooden structures, and more particularly poles or similar structures, in order to determine thereof the mechanical characteristics (strength), which consists in performing a measurement of the hardness of the wooden structure by deep penetration into its thickness of a measuring element. It is characterised in that:   - the hardness-measuring element consists of an assembly comprising two spikes (3, 4) actuated simultaneously and penetrating under pressure into the structure on either side of a rigid measuring spacer, to a predetermined and constant depth, the actual penetration force being measured by a force sensor; - simultaneously with this hardness measurement, a measurement is performed of the hygrometry of the wood at constant depth, making it possible to evaluate the risks of internal biological degradation; the information obtained being processed in order to give an instantaneous result relating to the strength of the structure.

Device making it possible to establish a diagnosis of the physical state
of trees, of wood and of wooden structures, and more particularly of poles or

similar structures, so as to determine the mechanical characteristics of them with a
view to making a selection of living trees or to identifying weakened or dangerous

poles that must be climbed in order to provide upkeep and maintenance on them,
comprising means carrying out a measurement of the hardness of the wooden

structure by depthwise penetration into its thickness of a measurement element,
characterized in that :


the hardness measurement element is constituted by an assembly
comprising two spikes (3,4) which are simultaneously actuated and penetrate by

means of pressure into the structure on either side of a rigid measurement spacing,
and to a predetermined and constant depth, the actual penetration force being

measured by a force sensor ;
said spikes are associated with means allowing, simultaneously with this
hardness measurement, to realize a measurement of the moisture content of the

wood at a constant depth in order to evaluate the risk of internal biological
degradation ;
the whole assembly being managed by a software processing the
informations obtained in order to give an instantaneous result relating to the

strength of the structure.
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the measurement of
the hardness of the wood and of the moisture content are carried out as close as

possible to ground level, the spikes which enable the local hardness to be measured
being insulated over their length and constituting electrodes making it possible to

check the moisture content using the resistive method, the resistively of the wood
being inversely proportional to the water content.
Device as claimed in one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that it
comprises :


an all-welded longitudinal body (5) incorporating two pairs of
positioning stops (6,7) enabling the apparatus to be fitted along the longitudinal

generatrix of the wooden structure, fixing being achieved by means of straps (8,9) ; 
a case (10) fixed to the base of the longitudinal body (5) and comprising
measurement and application members constituted by an assembly comprising said

two spikes (3,4) associated with a force sensor and driven translationally by means

of an operating arm (2), said spikes (3,4) constituting electrodes enabling the
depthwise measurement of the water content of the wooden structure to be

measured.
