The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine (7) 
including at least one cylinder with a cylinder (10-12) bore defined 

therein for reciprocatably receiving a piston (97) provided with a 
piston ring (215). Moreover it is provided with a coolant passage 

arrangement including a coolant jacket formed in the cylinder (10-12) 
around the cylinder bore. The internal combustion engine (7) is 

improved in that each piston ring is prevented from rotating 
around the longitudinal axis of the piston relative to the 

piston and the fuel injection valve means (36) is disposed aligned 
such that the fuel injection is directed towards the side of the 

cylinder (10-12) where the ring opening of each piston ring (215) is 
positioned. According to another aspect of the invention, the 

engine is improved in that a heat insulating means for 
preventing the cylinder (10-12) from overcooling is provided on an inner 

surface wall of the coolant jacket opposite to the coolant inlet 
opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine comprising at least one
cylinder with a piston reciprocatably received therein, said piston being provided at its outer
circumferential surface with at least one piston ring having a ring opening for allowing radial
expansion and compression, respectively of said piston ring, and a fuel injection valve
means for injecting fuel directly into said cylinder.Such an internal combustion engine is known from WO-A-87/00575.
Internal combustion engines normally use pistons having the
following
structure, namely a piston unit and piston rings which are fitted
around its circumference near the top of the piston. A part of
the piston ring is cut away, and the cut away area forms a mating
opening. The piston ring itself evinces some resiliency, and is
structured to expand outward in the radial direction; the piston
ring thereby slides against the inside circumferential surface
of the cylinder bore.Also, in the prior art, a fuel injection valve could be
mounted on one side in the radial direction of the combustion
chamber, a part of which was bounded by the piston ring, so that
fuel could be injected toward the opposite side of the combustion
chamber.In this case, the fuel injected into the combustion chamber
by the fuel injection valve is burned, causing the piston to
slide inside the cylinder bore, with the piston ring forming a
seal between the inside of the crankcase and the combustion
chamber, enabling the engine to deliver the required drive.As was described above, however, the mating opening of the
above piston ring, which forms the seal between the crankcase and
combustion chamber, comprises a gap, albeit small, and this
mating opening is susceptible to being heated to higher
temperatures than the other parts. The heating of this mating opening to such high temperatures
causes more carbon to be deposited in the mating opening than in
other areas, and this can cause the phenomenon of the piston ring
to become stuck to the piston unit (so-called "ring sticking").When ring-sticking occurs, the above piston ring is impeded
in its ability to expand outward in the radial direction as
described above, its sealing properties are lessened thereby, and
engine performance is degraded. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to
provide an internal combustion engine having an improved
cooling arrangement for cooling the cylinder piston assembly so
as to assure smooth reciprocal movement of the piston in the
cylinder including high quality
