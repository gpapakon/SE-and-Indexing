<ABSTRACT>
Tractor (1) with driver's cab (2) at the rear, featuring a 
recess (3) in the front part of which the front steering 

wheels (4) of the aircraft are entering and are blocked by 
idle front rollers (28) which may be moved inwards or 

outwards and an idle rear roller (36) driven by hydraulic 
fluid powered pistons (31, 34 ). According to one solution, 

an apron (32) is mounted on the tractor framework (1) on 
which apron (32) the wheels (4) of the aircraft will rest. 

This apron is lifted and lowered by hydraulic fluid powered 
pistons (7) connected to the articulated upper arm (9) of 

each tractor wheel (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention covers a tractor without drawbars for towing 
aircraft through its front steering wheels, which may be 
lifted or not. Several types of vehicles are known to tow 
airplanes, but they all have some drawbacks and defects. For instance, US-A-2987133 illustrates a towing vehicle 
provided with a long rotating framework, the free end of 
which is fitted with two wheels driven by the framework 
and a system connecting the wheels of the aircraft to the 
shaft. The wheels rotating in touch with the aircraft cause 
the latter to move. This solution is rather complicated, its 
functioning is uncertain and requires complex coupling and 
hooking up operations. Other solutions, such as US-A-3025922 and DE-A-2826161 
are known, consisting in a device like a motor-driven hoe, 
provided with a motorized roller in contact with one wheel  
 
of the airplane. Obviously, these solutions can only be used 
for moving small and light aircraft. US-A-3005510 is also known, which features a motor-driven 
belt to be inserted between the wheel sets of the aircraft. However, this solution can usually not be adopted on normal 
airliners. Besides, EP-A-0156842 is known, grouping two original 
Finnish Patents FI-A-75310 and FI-A-78426. This document 
describes a trolley with a recessed central zone in which the 
lateral non steering wheel or wheels of the airplane may 
penetrate. This trolley is provided with mobile rollers, 
moving in transverse vertical as well as in horizontal 
lengthwise direction, so that they may be placed adjacent, in 
front of or behind the wheels of the aircraft. At least one of 
these rollers is motor-driven and will drive the non-steering 
wheels or set of lateral wheels of the plane. But even this latter solution has some drawbacks. Since the 
trolley has no driving wheels, it has to be driven by an 
automotive vehicle. The rollers in touch with the lateral 
wheels of the aircraft are rather small, with little towing 
friction and there are no means to ensure a stable lateral 
support for the wheels of the airplane. These rollers are 
supported on one side only by the bearing frame so that they 
may get warped and deviated from their direction of motion. The above described towing device is applied to the lateral 
non-steering wheels of the airplane, so that the pilot has to  
 
steer the plane during towing or other persons shall 
move the front steering wheels of the aircraft with the 
aid of proper equipment. Furthermore, the front and rear rolllers are controlled 
by one single mechanism

the operator moves the tractor in direction of the front 
wheels of the aircraft and moves the tractor forewards until 

the wheels of the aircraft enter the recess (3) resting against 
the roller (36) placed into its position (36'), 
he then lowers the tractor by acting on the pushbutton (45) 
actuating the suspension cylinder during lowering 

and only after the tractor is lowered he presses the 
pushbutton (39) acting on the cylinders (31) which will bring 

the driving rollers (28) in touch with the wheels (4) of the 
plane, pushing these wheels (4) on the apron (32), 
the proportional valve (41) will stop the wheels in the correct 
position, 
the pressure release valve (42) permits to adjust the pressure 
of the two cylinders (34) until the wheels (4) of the aircraft 

are in touch with the roller (36) and the rollers (28) at the 
required pressure value, 
after having loaded the aircraft on the tractor, the operator 
presses the pushbutton (43) acting on the cylinders (7) of the 

suspensions that are jacking up the tractor,

their rest position (28'), 
the aircraft is then automatically discharged from the 
apron (32) by said two cylinders (34), 
after unloading, the operator presses the pushbutton 
(45) to jack up the tractor and then uses the gearshift 

and gas pedal to drive the tractor at the desired speed.
