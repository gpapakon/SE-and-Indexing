<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to arbitration mechanisms
in computer systems, and more particularly to arbitration logic for
computer systems comprising a plurality of buses interconnected by bus
bridges.Computer systems typically include more than one bus, each bus in
the system having devices attached thereto which communicate locally with
each other over the bus. System-wide communication over different buses
is required, however, if a device attached to one bus needs to read or
write information to or from a device on another bus. To permit system-wide
communication between devices on different buses, bus-to-bus bridges
(interfaces) are provided to match the communications protocol of one bus
with that of another.Known bus-to-bus bridges include those disclosed in the following
co-pending patent applications assigned to the IBM Corporation: European
Patent Application Nos. 550224, 553563, 550241 and 550223.
These applications describe mechanisms which permit system-wide
communication of devices attached to different buses in the system.Each bus-to-bus bridge in a multiple-bus computer system is used to
connect two buses in the system. Various types of buses are available to
construct a given computer system. Standard I/O buses include, for
example, ISA or MICRO CHANNEL ("MC-A") buses, are often used to connect
existing peripheral I/O devices to a system built around a more
centralized, high performance bus.One such high performance bus which is becoming widely accepted is
the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus, which is capable of
performing significant data transfer in a relatively short period of
time. The PCI bus permits up to 120 megabytes of usable data per second
throughput, 132 megabytes/second peak at 33 MHz with a 32-bit data path.
The PCI bus achieves this high level of performance, in part, because it 
may be directly linked to other high speed buses, such as system buses to
which a CPU may be connected, and thus may provide for rapid transfer of
data between devices attached to the PCI bus and devices attached to the
system bus. In fact, the operation of several high integration devices,
such as certain graphics package controllers, require a direct link to a
system bus through a high performance bus such as the PCI bus. In
addition, the PCI bus architecture does not require any "glue logic" to
operate peripheral devices connected to it. Glue logic for other buses
typically consists of miscellaneous hardware components such as decoders,
buffers or latches that are
