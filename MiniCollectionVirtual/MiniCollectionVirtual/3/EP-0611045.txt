<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a panel extension assembly for 
supporting an extension wall panel (11) on top of a base wall 

panel (13). The panel extension (11) has 
a channel member (10) adapted to receive a substantially 

horizontally extending top surface (28) of 
a base wall panel frame (12). The channel member (10) has a pair 

of spaced side walls joined by a 
middle wall and is adapted to slide over the sides and rest on the top surface of the base 

wall panel frame (20). An extension member (80) is attached to 
the channel member (10) and extends 

upward therefrom. An extension wall panel (11) is attached to 
the extension member (80) thereby 

securing the extension wall panel on top of the base wall panel (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to wall panel systems. More
particularly, the invention relates to a panel extension assembly that allows for a
previously constructed wall panel to have an additional wall panel stacked on top thereby
increasing the height of the wall.In many businesses, work areas must be constructed in different sizes and
shapes within a building with integral interior and outer walls. When permanent rigid
walls are used it is a relatively expensive and difficult task to change or relocate walls.
Accordingly, modular vertical wall panel systems are often used to divide an enclosed
space into separate work areas. These work areas are often constructed using panels of a
standard size. For example, an office may use a standard panel system that has a height
of 0.914m (36 inches). Wall panel systems constructed with 0.914m (36 inch) wall panels are
particularly useful in creating secreterial stations, and the like. While, taller wall panel
systems create a more private work area such as that required in telephone sales. However, if a
business desired to switch between an original shorter panel system and a larger wall
panel system, it would have to completely remove the original wall panel system and
replace it with taller vertical panels.While vertically adjustable wall panel systems are known, these systems
only provide a very limited range of motion in order to facilitate installation and
movement of the panels. In addition, a base cover is necessary to provide privacy in the
work area when the panel is adjusted vertically upward. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,407,101 (Propst) discloses a vertically adjustable wall panel. An adjustment bolt
connects one end of the wall panel to a foot assembly. The adjustment bolt is externally
threaded in opposite directions so that when the bolt is turned, the wall panel moves
vertically relative to the foot assembly. In order to conceal the adjustment bolt, elongated
covers are pivotally attached to the wall panel. However, this device fails to provide an
office wall panel system that is easily extended to a new height. Therefore, a simple and
more versatile panel extension mechanism is needed.Another modular panel system is described in
CA-A-955,718 in which one panel (or frame) may be
arranged to overlie another. However, the mechanism
by which the panels interengage relies upon the
receipt of a circular stud on one of the panels in a
hollow side member of square cross-section provided on
the other of the panels.According to the present

<CLAIMS>
A panel extension assembly (11) for supporting an
extension wall panel (15) on top of a base wall panel

(13), the base wall panel (13) being encased in a
frame (20) including a top member (28) having a

substantially horizontally extending top surface (46)
and a pair of spaced side surfaces, said panel

extension assembly (11) comprising: a channel member
(82) adapted to receive said top member (28) of said

base wall panel frame (20), said channel member (82)
having a pair of spaced side walls (84,86) joined by a

middle wall (88) adapted to slide over said side
surfaces of said top member (28) and rest on said top

surface (46); an extension member (100) attached to
said channel member (82) and extending upward

therefrom; and an extension wall panel (15) attached
to said extension member (100) whereby said extension

wall panel (15) is securely positioned on top of said
base wall panel (13).
The panel extension assembly (11) of claim 1
further comprising a first fastening means that

secures said extension wall panel (15) to said
extension member (100).
The panel extension assembly (11) of claim 2
further comprising a second fastening means (94) that

secures said channel member (82) to said top member
(28) of said base wall
 panel frame (20).
The panel extension assembly (11) of claim 3
wherein said middle wall (88) of said channel member

(82) has an aperture (92) through which said second
fastening means (94) extends thereby securing said 

channel member (82) to said top member (28) of said
base wall panel frame (20).
The panel extension assembly (11) of any
preceding claim wherein said channel member (82) has

an upwardly extending triangular shaped flange (96)

extension member (100).
The panel extension assembly (11) of claim 5
wherein the extension member (100) has two spaced

apart walls forming a vertically extending channel
(108) that receives an adjoining extension wall panel

(15).
The panel extension assembly (11) of any
preceding claim, further comprising a cap member (120)
