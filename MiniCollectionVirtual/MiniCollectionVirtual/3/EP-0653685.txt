<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining 
lithographic printing plates from imaging elements comprising a 
photopolymerisable composition. The use of photosensitive imaging elements comprising 
photopolymerizable compositions for the production of images by 
information-wise exposure thereof to actinic radiation is well 
known. Several methods for forming images using photopolymerizable 
compositions are known. All these methods are based on the 
principle of introducing a differentiation in properties between the 
exposed and non-exposed parts of the photopolymerizable composition 
e.g. a difference in solubility, adhesion, conductivity, refractive 
index, tackiness, permeability, diffusibility of incorporated 
substances e.g. dyes etc.. The thus produced differences may be 
subsequently employed in a developing step to produce a visible 
image and/or master for printing e.g. a lithographic or 
electrostatic printing master. A difference in solubility between the exposed and non-exposed 
parts of the photopolymerizable composition is often used for the 
production of lithographic printing plates where a hydrophilic base 
is coated with the photopolymerizable composition, subsequently 
exposed and developed using a solvent to remove the non-exposed or 
insufficiently exposed parts. Such a process is for example 
described in "Unconventional imaging processes" by E. Brinckman, G. 
Delzenne, A. Poot and J. Willems, Focal Press London-New York, first 
edition 1978, pages 33 to 39 and in GB-P 1,419,512. The use of the difference in tackiness to obtain an image is 
described in e.g. US-P 3,060,024, 3,085,488 and 3,649,268. 
According to the method disclosed in these US patents the image-wise 
exposed photopolymerizable composition looses its tackiness in the 
exposed parts while the non-exposed parts keep their tackiness. The 
non-exposed parts can therefore be colored with dry dye pigments to 
make the image visible. According to a method disclosed in US-P 3,060,023 the adhesion  
 
of the photopolymerizable composition is modified upon image-wise 
exposure. After image-wise exposure the non-exposed parts will 
stick or adhere, during a step of overall heating, to an image 
receiving means thus allowing the transfer of the non-exposed parts 
to the image receiving means. UD-P 3,307,943 discloses a process for image production which 
comprises (i) exposing imagewise a photopolymerizable element to 
provide a difference of at least 10° C in the stick temperature of 
said exposed and
