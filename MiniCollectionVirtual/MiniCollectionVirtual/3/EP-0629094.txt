<ABSTRACT>
A radio system which is arranged to operate in accordance 
with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at 

least one time slot in each frame is designated for the 
transmission of access contention data, which includes a field 

reserved for data specifying the number of information slots 
required by a sub-unit, and which system includes a base station 

adapted for operation such that consequent upon receipt of data 
in the said reserved field, the base station is arranged to respond 

by allocating available slots to satisfy the requirement of the sub-unit, 
characterised in that the sub-unit includes a memory storage 

device used to store data appertaining to the information slots 
used in a previously activity period transmitted frame and a slot 

transmission timer responsive to the store for resetting the 
transmitter so that the same time slots are re-selected for use in 

the present activity period, consequent upon confirmation from 
the base station that the slots used in the previous period of 

activity should be re-used in the present period of activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellular mobile radio systems and
more especially, although not exclusively, it relates to an
improvement in or modification of a cellular mobile radio system
arranged to operate in accordance with the packet reservation
multiple access protocol which forms the subject of our co-pending
GB Patent Application No 9219824.1. Although the
invention is primarily intended for incorporation in digital cellular
mobile radio communication systems, it may also find application
in wireless local area networks.According to our co-pending patent application, a cellular
mobile radio system is provided which is arranged to operate in
accordance with a packet reservation multiple access protocol,
where at least one time slot in each frame is designated for the
transmission of access contention data which includes a field
reserved for data specifying a number of information slots
required by a mobile unit, and which system includes a base
station adapted for operation such that consequent upon receipt of
data in the said reserved field, the base station is arranged to
respond by allocating available slots to satisfy the requirement of
the mobile unit. One important advantage of this system as will
be appreciated by those skilled in the art, is that since only one
access contention request is required, irrespective of the number
of information slots required, the access contention time required
to reserve capacity will be minimised or at least substantially 
reduced as compared with a system in which each individual slot must be
contended for. Although the system is an improvement over hitherto known
arrangements, in that the access contention time is reduced, in order to
provide for transmission from the mobile in the slots allocated by the base
station, a fair amount of signal processing power is required so that
transmission bursts can be appropriately scheduled whereby the correct
reserved slots allocated are used. Provided the scheduling operation is not
required too frequently, the additional time taken by a low powered processor,
which is correspondingly less expensive to fabricate, is acceptable. However,
in the case of successive transmission bursts which require the scheduling of
transmission burst to be re-configured repeatedly at short notice, higher power
processing is required if unacceptable delays are to be avoided. As will be
appreciated an increase in the access delay experienced by a mobile may for
example result in audibly degraded speech quality.The document entitled "A
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A radio system which is arranged to operate in accordance
with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at

least one time slot in each frame is designated for the
transmission of access contention data, which includes a field

reserved for data specifying the number of information slots
required by a sub-unit (1-17, 30), and which system includes a

base station (18-29) adapted for operation such that consequent
upon receipt of data in the said reserved field, the base station

(18-29) is arranged to respond by allocating available slots to
satisfy the requirement of the sub-unit, characterised in that the

sub-unit (1-17, 30) includes a memory storage device (17) used to
store data appertaining to the information slots used in a previous

transmission and a slot transmission timer (17) responsive to the
store for resetting the transmitter so that the same time slots are

re-selected for use in the present period of activity, consequent
upon confirmation from the base station that the slots used in the

previous transmission should be reused in the next successive
frame.
A system as claimed in claim 1, and wherein the radio
system is a cellular mobile radio system wherein the sub-unit

(1-17, 30) is a mobile unit. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein the system
additionally comprises activity detector means (30) responsive to

the commencement of activity requiring transmission from the
mobile for activating the slot transmission timer (17) so that slot

re-selection is commenced.
A system as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, wherein
preparation for the same slots to be re-used is performed also in

the base station (18-29) wherein the receiver chain (23) is
prepared in advance and so expects to receive transmission bursts

in slots used previously.
