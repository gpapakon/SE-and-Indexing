<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an endless track running gear which is preferably fitted with a rubber running belt and is intended for vehicles and self-propelling machines, in particular for agricultural harvesting machines. The endless track running gear, which can be used in a relatively simple and cost-effective manner instead of the previously used wheeled running gear of a machine or a vehicle, has an endless-track carrier 1 which has a closed hollow profile and in its front region is coupled in a rotationally fixed manner to a front axle 31 and to a rear axle 32 via a final gear 3 flange-mounted at the opposite end, the axles each being connected fixedly to the machine frame 33. Inserted into the hollow profile of the endless-track carrier 1 is an input gear 21 which is rotationally connected via a propeller shaft 22 to the machine drive and, for the purpose of transmitting the driving motion from the input gear 21 to the driving-gear pair 12 there is inserted a hollow shaft 7, the bearing journals 35; 24 of which, which are flange-mounted on the ends, are mounted in bearings 25; 36 which are situated in the gear casing of the input and final gears 21; 6.

A caterpillar track running gear for vehicles and self-propelled 
machines, preferably for agricultural harvesters, comprising a 

respective track tensioning device (17) which is arranged at the front 
end of a caterpillar track carrier (1) and which carries the idler guide 

roller (16) of the endless caterpillar track (4), wherein one or more 
swing supports (2) which are mounted pivotably about horizontal axes and 

which carry the rotatably mounted tread rollers (20) of the caterpillar 
track (4) are pivotably mounted on the longitudinal axis of the 

caterpillar track carrier (1), characterised in that the caterpillar 
track running gear has a final transmission (3) flange-mounted to the 

rear end of the caterpillar track carrier (1) for the drive of the drive 
wheel (12) of the caterpillar track (4), that each caterpillar track 

carrier (1) has a closed hollow profile which has assembly and service 
openings (41) and which in the region of its front end portion is non-rotatably 

mounted to a front axle (31) and by way of a final 
transmission (3) flange-mounted to the oppositely disposed end, to a 

rear axle (32), which axles are each fixedly connected to the vehicle or 
machine frame (33), and that arranged in the hollow profile of each 

caterpillar track carrier (1) are an input transmission (21) which is 
connected at the drive side to a machine drive and a hollow shaft (7) 

which transmits the drive movement to the final transmission (3), 
wherein the hollow shaft (7) is mounted at its ends in bearings (25; 36) 

which are provided in the input and final transmissions (3; 21). 
A caterpillar track running gear according to claim 1 
characterised in that the input transmission (21) is rotationally 

connected to the machine drive by way of a universally jointed shaft 
(22). 
A caterpillar track running gear according to claim 1 and claim 
2 characterised in that the input transmission (21) comprises a bevel 

gear assembly (26; 27) and the machine drive has a combined transmission  
 

(23) comprising a shift transmission (29) and two steering differential 
transmissions (28) arranged in separate transmission casings with 

service and parking brakes (37) which are arranged on the drive shaft 
(38) and to which the universally jointed shaft (22) is flange-connected. 
A caterpillar track running gear according to one of claims 1 
to 3 characterised in that the final transmission (3) comprises a bevel 

gear assembly (8; 9) and a spur gear pair (10; 11), wherein the bevel 
gear (9) and the spur gear (10) are arranged on an intermediate shaft 

(39), the spacing of the axis of which relative to the bearing (25) of 
the hollow shaft (7) is precisely fixed, and the spur gear (11) is 

mounted on an axle (6) which carries the drive gear pair (12) and whose 
position relative to the intermediate shaft (39) is variable. 
A caterpillar track running gear according to one of claims 1 
to 4 characterised in that the hollow shaft (7) has connecting flanges 

(40) which are arranged at the ends and to which mounting shaft portions 
(24; 35) are non-rotatably mounted by co-operating flange means, which 

mounting shaft portions are supported by the bearings (25; 36) in the 
input and final transmissions (21; 3). 
A caterpillar track running gear according to one of claims 1 
to 5 characterised in that the idler guide wheel and the drive wheel for 

the endless caterpillar track (4) are in the form of pairs of wheels 
(12; 16) and are respectively arranged on a common axle (15; 6). 
A caterpillar track running gear according to one of claims 1 
to 6 characterised in that the endless caterpillar track (4) is 

preferably a rubber tread and the width of the tread rollers (20) which 
are rotatably mounted on swing supports (2) on the longitudinal axis 

(18) of the caterpillar track carrier (1) is so selected that the tread 
rollers (20) extend into the edge region of the rubber tread.  

 
A caterpillar track running gear according to one of claims 1 
to 7 characterised in that stabilisers (34) are arranged in a V-shape 

between the front and rear axles (31; 32) and are releasably fixed to 
the axles (31; 32).
