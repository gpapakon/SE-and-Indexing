<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to highly soluble, physiologically acceptable
inclusion complexes of nimesulide- salts with cyclodextrins,
to the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions
containing the same as well as methods for their use.More particularly the invention relates to inclusion complexes
of nimesulide alkali and alkaline earth salts of general formula
(I) with cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives.In this specification in the general formula
-A always stands for an alkali and alkaline earth ion.Nimesulide [4-nitro-2-phenoxy-methane-sulfonanilide] is known to
be a potent non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug successfully
used for the treatment of different painful inflammatory conditions,
rheumatoid arthritis and it possesses antipyretic activities
too (Belgian Patent N° 801812). Solutions of nimesulide
sodium salts were prepared from nimesulide with sodium carbonate
in acetone and they were used without isolation as intermediates
to prepare N-substituted nimesulide derivatives (Belgian Patent
N° 801812). Probably due to the high pH value of their solutions
the nimesulide alkali and alkaline earth salts were not
used practically as pharmaceuticals. Recently it has been confirmed
that based on its mechanism of action in pain relief, nimesulide
can be also considered to represent a new type of useful
analgesic agents. In case of such drugs a quick onset of action
of the orally administered formulation is a very important
factor.Compared to other non-steroidal antiinflammatories, nimesulide
has a favorable therapeutic index, minimal acute gastrointestinal
toxicity and shows good general tolerability. It is chemically
different from other drugs of its class, because its
functional acidic group is a sulfonanilide moiety.Nimesulide is a very hydrophobic drug substance practically insoluble
in water, its aqueous solublity is about 0.01 mg/ml at
room temperature. The very poor aqueous solubility and wettability
of the drug present problems for the preparation of pharmaceutical
formulations with good release and non-variable bioavailability. To overcome the disadvantages connected with the very poor
aqueous solubility and wettability the increase of aqueous solubility
is an essential aim.Nimesulide is a weak acid type compound therefore its aqueous
solubility in acidic medium, e.g. at the pH of the gastric juice
is particularly poor. Orally administered nimesulide is likely
to be absorbed only in the lower part of the gastrointestinal
tract, probably this explains the rather protracted onset of
