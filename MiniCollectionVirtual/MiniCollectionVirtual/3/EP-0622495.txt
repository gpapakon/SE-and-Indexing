<ABSTRACT>
A rubbery buckling-type marine fender (10) such as a 
cell-type hollow cylindrical marine fender, a 

frustoconical-type hollow cylindrical marine fender, or 
a V-shaped marine fender, comprises a main rubber 

portion (12), a securing flange portion (13), and a 
shock receiving portion (14), in which a rubber 

thickened region (19) is formed in the inner peripheral 
surface of the main rubber body portion (12) at a given 

position adjacent or close to a buckling point (P) to 
prevent falling of reaction force during the buckling 

deformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a marine fender and
more particularly to an improvement of a rubbery
buckling-type marine fender such as a hollow cylindrical
marine fender, a V-shaped marine fender, a frustoconical
marine fender or the like which is likely to undergo buckling
during compression deformation.As an example of a conventional buckling-type
marine fender, there is known a rubbery hollow cylindrical
marine fender of a conical trapezoidal form as shown in
Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings. This marine fender comprises a main cylindrical
rubber portion 2, a securing flange portion 3 for attachment to a quay
wall, a shock receiving portion 4 and reinforcing steel
plates 5, 6 embedded in the portions 3, 4. When such a
marine fender is compressed in its axial direction upon
berthing a vessel, there is obtained
a deflection - reaction force curve absorbing the berthing
energy as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, after the
reaction force increases with the increase of the
deflection to arrive at an upper peak (point A), it 
decreases to arrive at a point C though the deflection
increases, and again rapidly increases with further
increase of the deflection.The marine fender exhibiting such a characteristic
curve is actually used up to a point B showing the
reaction force equal to the point A, in which the
absorption energy of the marine fender is represented by
an area surrounded by the deflection - reaction force
curve and an abscissa up to the point B. However, the
reaction force is actually decreased to the point C, so
that the absorption energy is lost only by a portion S
corresponding to an area surrounded by a broken line A-B
and a curved line A-C-B. Therefore, it is required to
increase the falling of reaction force represented by the
point C to the dotted line A-B to increase the energy
absorption by the area S.Similarly, the above phenomenon is observed in a
V-shaped marine fender subjected to a berthing load in a
direction perpendicular to the axial direction thereof.In order to overcome the above problem of the
conventional marine fender, there has been proposed a hollow
cylindrical marine fender in JP-Y-2-30505. This marine
fender comprises a main cylindrical portion of a
frustoconical form and a shock receiving portion of a
cylindrical form, in which it is attempted to reduce the loss of the absorption
energy by specifying 
relationships between the height of the main cylindrical
portion and the height of the shock receiving portion and
between the outer diameter of the shock receiving portion
