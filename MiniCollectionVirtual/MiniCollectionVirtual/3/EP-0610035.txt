<ABSTRACT>
A system for printing security documents which have copy detection or tamper 
resistance in plural colors with a single pass electronic printer printing an integrated image 

controlled by an image generation system which electronically generates a safety background 
image pattern (42) with first and second interposed color patterns which is electronically 

merged with alphanumeric information (45,47) and a protected signature (43) into an 
integrated electronic image (40) for the printer (15). The single pass printer preferably has an 

imaging surface upon which two latent images thereof are interposed, developed with two 
differently colored developer materials, and simultaneously transferred to the subst
rate in a 
single pass. The color patterns are preferably oppositely varying density patterns of 

electronically generated pixel dot images with varying spaces therebetween. Preferably a 
portion (46) of the alphanumeric information is formed by a special secure font, such as a low 

density shadow copy. The validating signature also preferably has two intermixed color 
halftone patterns with halftone density gradients varying across the signature in opposite 

directions, but differently from the background. Also electronically superimposed in the safety 
background pattern may be substantially invisible latent image pixel patterns (53) which 

become visible when copied, and/or are machine readable even in copies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plural color printing system for printing plural color
security documents according to the preamble of claim 1.From document US-A-4 579 370 a plural color printing system for printing plural color
security documents having features similar to the preamble of claim 1 is known.Security documents having cancellation terms and background patterns in two tones are
known from EP-A-0 522 827. Another type of security document having phase-shifted characters is
known from US-A-5 178 418.Although no security printing system can fully protect against determined forgers, or
careless users, a variety of methods are known in the art for attempting to hinder and/or help detect
forgery, alteration or duplication of sensitive documents such as negotiable instruments, especially
checks and bank drafts. Other examples of documents for which resistance to forgery, copying, or
other tampering is desired include stock or bond certificates, driver's licenses, identification cards
or papers, passports, betting slips, prize or game awards, tickets, or documents that simply require
validating signatures to be affixed thereto, such as electronically negotiated and/or transmitted
contracts, etc..Negotiable instruments and other such security documents are now typically over-printed
on expensive, pre-printed "safety paper" that has a pre-printed background pattern which is not
readily reproducible by a copy machine or the like. The pertinent negotiable information of the
instrument must be subsequently printed in a separate printing operation onto this pre-printed
safety paper. Other tamper-resistance schemes include printing pertinent information such as
names and numbers, especially amounts of money, in a form that is not amenable to alterations,
such as with paper perforations, overprints, further background patterns, or other additional
treatments. However, that can add even further printing or processing steps and expense,
especially if adding another color is utilized.The advent of high resolution color copying machines have provided forgers with an
increased facility with which to reproduce even plural color secure documents (even bank notes or
currency). Consequently, safety paper desirably has an effective halftone pattern density
(fineness) above a color copier's resolution threshold, thus advantageously exploiting the
limitations of color copy machines. It is also reportedly known in the art to use multi-colored safety
paper stock with pastel colors that shade into one another that

<CLAIMS>
A plural-color printing system for printing plural color security
documents (40) with a printed image (42) resistant to reproduction

or alteration,
characterized by
an electronic single pass color printer (15) for printing an integrated
image of the security document (40),
control means for controlling said single-pass electronic printer (15)
for said forming of said integrated security document image, and
an image generation system (11) for electronically generating a
safety background image pattern (42) with at least a first color

pattern and a second color pattern, said first color pattern being
interposed with said second color pattern to form an interposed

plural color pattern, and said image generation system (11) being
fur
ther capable of providing and electronically merging
alphanumeric information (46) interposed with said safety

background image pattern,
wherein said printer (15) is adapted to print said integrated image
security document comprising all elements generated by said image

generation system and all colors in a single pass.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in claim 1, in which said
single pass electronic printer (15) comprises an imaging surface

upon which latent images of said first and second color patterns are
interposed and then separately developed with two differently

colored developer materials to form a print image which is
simultaneously transferred to a substrate to produce said integrated

image security document.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein said image generation system is capable of generating first

and second color patterns with differently varying density patterns
of electronically generated pixel dot images with varying spaces

therebetween for tamper resistance and copying detection
assistance.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein image generation system is capable of

generating said safety background image (42) so as to include
interdigitated halftone patterns of said first color and said second

color, and said alphanumeric information so as to comprise at least
one of said first or second colors.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein image generation system is capable of

generating at least a portion of said alphanumeric information (46)
so as to be formed by a special secure font that is resistant to

alteration.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein image generation system is capable of

generating said alphanumeric information so as to include an
electronically varied halftone patterned signature reproduction (43). 
A plural-color printing system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein image generation system is capable of

generating said integrated image so as to include at least two
intermixed color halftone patterns of variable density, with each

color halftone pattern having a density gradient in a different
direction from the other.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said electronic single pass color printer is

capable of printing a low halftone density copy of selected said
alphanumeric information on said security document adjacent to a

high density print of said same alphanumeric information.
A plural-color printing system as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said electronic single pass color printer is

capable of printing, superimposed in said safety background image
pattern, a latent image pixel pattern which is substantially invisible

on said printed security document but which pixel pattern is
emphasized by and becomes visible by reproduction on a normal

copier.
