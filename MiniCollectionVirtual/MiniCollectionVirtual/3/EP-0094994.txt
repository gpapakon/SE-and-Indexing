<ABSTRACT>
An improved rotary drum filter is described. The filter 
includes a liquid collection means (80) communicating with 

at least a plurality of fluid conduits (31). The collection means 
(80) collect and discharge residual liquid remaining in the 

fluid conduits (31) during each rotation of the filter drum to 
decrease the erosive effects of the residual liquid on the filter 

cloth.
