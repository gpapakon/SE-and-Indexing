<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing fluorochemical 
compounds, e.g., perfluoroalkanes, perfluoroethers, and 

perfluoroalkyl tertiary amines, comprises 

(a) forming a mixture comprising at least one 
fluorinatable, non-functional organic starting 

compound, e.g., propane, and at least one other 
compound which is present in an amount sufficient to 

enable the formation of a fluorochemical phase and 
which is selected from the group consisting of 


(i) perfluorochemical compounds, e.g., 
perfluorohexane, which boil at a higher temperature 

than either the fluorinatable, non-functional organic 
starting compound or the fluorochemical compound 

resulting from the subsequent fluorination of the 
fluorinatable, non-functional organic starting 

compound; and 
(ii) precursor compounds, e.g., hexane, 
which can be fluorinated in situ to produce such 

perfluorochemical compounds; and 
(b) subjecting the mixture to electrochemical 
fluorination in the presence of anhydrous hydrogen 

fluoride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
preparing fluorochemicals by the electrochemical
fluorination of fluorinatable organic starting
compounds.Fluorochemical compounds and their
derivatives (sometimes called organofluorine compounds
or fluorochemicals) are a class of substances which
contain portions that are fluoroaliphatic or
fluorocarbon in nature, e.g., nonpolar, hydrophobic,
oleophobic, and chemically inert, and which may further
contain portions which are functional in nature, e.g.,
polar and chemically reactive. The class includes some
commercial substances which are familiar to the general
public, such as those which give oil and water
repellency and stain and soil resistance to textiles,
e.g., Scotchgard™ brand carpet protector. The class
also includes perfluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons,
which are useful as replacements for the
chlorofluorocarbon compounds (CFCs) that have been
linked to the destruction of the earth's protective
ozone layer.An industrial process for producing many
fluorochemical compounds, such as perfluorinated and
partially-fluorinated organofluorine compounds, is the
electrochemical fluorination process commercialized
initially in the 1950s by 3M Company, which comprises
passing an electric current through an electrolyte,
viz., a mixture of fluorinatable organic starting
compound and liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, to
produce the desired fluorinated compound or
fluorochemical. This fluorination process, commonly 
referred to as the "Simons electrochemical fluorination
process" or, more simply, either the Simons process or
Simons ECF, is a highly energetic process which is
somewhat hazardous due to the use of anhydrous hydrogen
fluoride.Some early patents describing the Simons
process and its use to prepare such subclasses of
fluorochemicals as fluorocarbon carbonyl fluorides,
fluorocarbon sulfonyl fluorides, and derivatives
thereof include U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,519,983 (Simons),
2,567,011 (Diesslin et al.), 2,666,797 (Husted et al.),
2,691,043 (Husted et al.), and 2,732,398 (Brice et al.)
The Simons process is also disclosed in some detail by
