<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle occupant restraint assembly (12) comprises 
an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint (20), a housing 

(14), a gas generating material (16) within the housing, an 
igniter (18) for igniting the gas generating material, and 

gas flow means (22) for directing the gas which is 
generated into the vehicle occupant restraint. The vehicle 

occupant restraint is preferably an air bag. The gas 
generating material (16) comprises (a) an alkali metal 

azide, alkaline earth metal azide or aluminum azide and (b) 
a metal oxidant which is the gamma form of ferric oxide 

(Fe₂O₃). The metal oxidant is present in the gas generating 
composition in an approximately stoichiometric amount with 

regard to the metal azide, or in an amount slightly in 
excess of stoichiometric.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas generator for a 
vehicle occupant restraint, such as an air bag, and to a 
gas generating composition which is used in the gas 
generator. A large number of gas generating compositions have 
been proposed for generating gas to operate vehicle 
occupant restraints, such as air bags and pretensioners for 
seat belts. For air bags, in particular, compositions 
which produce an inert gas, such as nitrogen, have been 
preferred. Excellent results have been achieved with solid 
nitrogen generating compositions which comprise an alkali 
metal azide fuel and one or more oxidizing agents for the 
fuel. Compositions comprising these materials produce, on 
combustion, a nitrogen gas along with other products of 
reaction.  
 One preferred oxidizing agent for an azide containing 
gas generating material is a metal oxide. A particularly 
preferred metal oxide is ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Ferric oxide 
is preferred because it is commercially readily available, 
less expensive than other metal oxides, and easier to work 
with when manufacturing gas generating material. The form of ferric oxide which has been traditionally 
used, in combination with sodium azide, in the preparation 
of a gas generating composition for a vehicle occupant 
restraint, is alpha iron oxide. U.S. Patent No. 4,902,036 
discloses that this ferric oxide, though capable of a 
relatively high effective gas output, often requires the 
addition of a burn rate enhancer for a gas generating 
composition containing the oxidizer to reach its full 
potential. U.S. Patent No. 4,604,151 discloses data comparing the 
burning rate and heat of reaction of a sodium azide 
containing gas generating composition, in which the 
oxidizer is ferric oxide, with the same or a similar 
composition in which the oxidizer is nickel oxide (NiO2) or 
copper oxide (CuO). Specifically, a composition having 
65.5% sodium azide, 30% ferric oxide, and 4.5% ammonium 
perchlorate had a heat of reaction of 1714 Joules/gram (410 calories/gram) and 
a burning rate, at 6,895 x 106 N/m2 (1,000 psi), of 3,30 cm/sec (1.30 in./sec). In 
contrast, a similar composition containing 30% nickel oxide 
had a heat of reaction of 1906 Joules/gram (456 calories/gram) and a burning 
rate, at 6,895 x 106 N/m2 (1,000 psi), of 3,71 cm/sec (1.46 in./sec). A composition  
 
containing 61% sodium azide, 34.5% copper oxide, and 4.5% 
ammonium perchlorate, had a heat of reaction of 2039 Joules/gram (487.8 
calories/gram) and a burning rate, at 6,895 x 106 N/m2 (1,000
