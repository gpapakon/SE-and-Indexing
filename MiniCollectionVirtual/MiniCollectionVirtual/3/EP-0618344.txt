<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fine particle 
size cementing composition for use in cementing wells. In general cementing operations wherein hard 
substantially impermeable cementitious masses are formed in 
desired locations, hydraulic cement compositions have 
heretofore been utilized which contain relatively large 
particle size hydraulic cements, e.g. Portland cements, 
along with water and other additives. In specialized cementing operations such as those 
carried out in constructing and repairing oil, gas and water 
wells, large particle size cement compositions have also 
been utilized. In primary well cementing, i.e. the forming 
of a cement sheath in the annular space between pipe 
disposed in a well bore and the walls of the well bore, a 
pumpable hydraulic cement composition is introduced into the 
annular space and the cement composition is permitted to set 
therein. The resulting cement sheath provides physical 
support and positioning to the pipe in the well bore and 
prevents unwanted fluid migration between subterranean zones 
and formations penetrated by the well bore. After a well has been utilized in the recovery of 
fluids from or the introduction of fluids into subterranean 
formations, problems relating to the undesirable passage of  
 
fluids into and from subterranean formations or the well bore 
penetrating such formations sometimes occur. This undesirable 
passage of fluids ordinarily involves the flow of oil, gas or 
water through small openings such as holes or cracks in well 
casings; holes, cracks, voids or channels in the cement sheath 
in the annular space between the walls of the well bore and 
the pipe therein; very small spaces between the cement sheath 
and the exterior surface of the casing or the walls of the 
well bore; and permeable spaces in gravel packs and 
formations. Heretofore, such openings have been plugged or 
attempted to be plugged using cement compositions of 
relatively large particle size. As a result, when the 
openings are very small, it is difficult to cause the cement 
composition of relatively large particle size to enter the 
openings and set therein whereby the openings are plugged. If 
the cement composition utilized cannot enter the openings, at 
best a bridge or patch may be formed over the openings to 
produce only a temporary termination of the undesirable fluid 
flow. Recently, fine particle size cement compositions have 
been used successfully in the construction and repair of 
wells. Such fine particle size cement compositions and

<CLAIMS>
A fine particle size cementing composition for 
cementing in a subterranean zone penetrated by a well bore, 

which composition comprises a fine particle size ASTM Class 
C or the equivalent fly ash wherein the particles are of a 

size no greater than 36 microns and have a specific surface 
area no less than 1.1 square meters per cubic centimeter; a 

dispersing agent comprised of the condensation polymer 
product of acetone, formaldehyde and sodium sulfite, present 

in said composition in an amount of from 0.25% to 1% by 
weight of said fly ash in said composition; and sufficient 

water to form a pumpable slurry. 
A composition according to claim 1, which further 
comprises a set delaying additive for increasing the time in 

which said composition sets. 
A composition according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the set delaying additive is an ammonium lignosulfonate salt 

present in said composition in an amount of from 0.1% to 4% 
by weight of the composition. 
A composition according to claim 1,2 or 3, which 
further comprises a fine particle size Portland cement 

wherein the particles are of a size no greater than about 30 
microns, and have a specific surface area no less than 1.5 

square meters per cubic centimeter, present in said 
composition in an amount of from 30% to 100% by weight of 

said composition. 
A method of cementing in a subterranean zone 
penetrated by a well bore, which method comprises the steps 

of pumping a cementing composition into said zone, the 
composition being as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, and 

lao Iallowing the composition to set into a hard substantially 
impermeable mass in said zone.
