<ABSTRACT>
In an optical switch of the DOS ("Digital Optical Switch") type, an entry guide (HE) and two divergent exit guides (HD,HG) constitute a guiding structure. A central separation located between these two exit guides constitutes a guide gap (6). Electrodes (MC,MD,MG) make it possible to selectively control effective refractive indices of these two exit guides in order to couple this input guide to one or other or to both of these exit guides depending on the value of a control signal (J). According to the invention, the width (LH) of the guide gap (6) is increased in two entry (Z2,Z3) and exit (Z7) transition zones in order to vary this width more progressively therein, this being achieved by means of a central recess at the end of the entry guide and by means of a progressive variation in the inclination of the facing edges of the exit guides.

Digital optical switch in which an input guide (HE) and two divergent output
guides (HD, HG) constitute a guide structure having a median gap between said

two output guides constituting a guide gap (6), electrodes (MC, MD, MG)
controlling the effective refractive indices of said two output guides to couple said

input guide to one or both output guides according to the value of a control
signal (J), this switch being characterized in that said input guide is divided in the

vicinity of said output guides into two partial guides (SED, SEG) separated by a
median aperture extending said guide gap.
Switch according to claim 1, characterized in that said median aperture of the
input guide (HE) has, in an area constituting a gap forming area (Z2), a width

increasing progressively from a null width to a width equal to that of said guide
gap (6) between said output guides (HD, HG) in the vicinity of said input guide.
Switch according to claim 2, characterized in that edges (SEDG, SEGD) of said
median aperture have an inclination from 1 mrd to 10 mrd in said gap forming

area (Z2) relative to an axis (OX) of said input guide (HE).
Switch according to claim 2, characterized in that, in a gap maintaining area
(Z3) extending from said gap forming area (Z2) towards said output guides

(HD, HG), said median aperture of said input guide has a constant width equal
to the width of said guide gap 6 between said output guides in the vicinity of said

input guide.
Switch according to claim 4, characterized in that said gap maintenance area
(Z3) has a length between 10% and 150% of the length of said gap formation

area (Z2).
Digital optical switch in which an input guide (HE) and two divergent output
guides (HD, HG) constitute a guide structure having between said two output

guides a median gap constituting a guide gap (6), electrodes (MC, MD, MG) for
selectively controlling effective refractive indexes of these two output guides to

couple said input guide to one and/or the other of said output guides according
to the value of a control signal (J), said two output guides defining areas forming

a succession (Z5 ... Z8) along the length of said guides from one end of said
guides facing said input guide (HE), said two output guides having two respective

inside edges facing each other, each of said two inside edges having in each of
said areas an inclination relative to an axis (OX) passing between the two edges,

this inclination having the same absolute value and two mutually opposite 
directions for the respective two edges, said absolute value constituting an

inclination value, said succession of areas beginning with an area (Z5) in which
said inclination has a null value, said succession finishing in an area (Z8) in

which each of said output guides has a constant width and in which said
inclination value is constant and constitutes a nominal inclination value (A)

representative of a divergence of said guides,

said switch being characterized in that said succession of areas includes at least
one intermediate area (Z6, Z7) and in that said inclination value increases along

this succession of areas, passing through at least one intermediate value (A/2)
between said null value and said nominal inclination value.
Switch according to any of claims 1 to 6, said switch including a semiconductor
wafer (2), said input guide (HE) and output guides (HD, HG) being formed on

one face (4) of said wafer.
