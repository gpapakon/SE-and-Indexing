<ABSTRACT>
Described is a semiconductor optical sensor comprising 
an amorphous carbon layer (2) and 
a transparent electrode (3) 
on one side of a semiconductor substrate (1) and an ohmic 

electrode (5) on the other side of the semiconductor substrate 
(1) wherein a rectifying junction is formed between 

said carbon layer and said semiconductor substrate. The carbon 
layer having a relatively high resistivity substantially 

suppresses a leakage current otherwise occurring under 
reverse bias, and at the same time serves as a protective 

layer. A preferred method of forming the amorphous carbon 
layer (2) on the semiconductor substrate (1) is by decomposition 

of ethyl alcohol in a DC plasma CVD process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor optical 
sensor or photodetector for sensing light by utilizing a 
photo-electric effect. The invention also relates to a 
manufacturing method. Currently, Si photodiodes having PN junctions or PIN junctions 
are mainly used as semiconductor optical sensors in a 
wide variety of industrial applications. In these cases the 
junction is formed by diffusing impurities into a single crystalline 
or polycrystalline substrate or by successively 
depositing amorphous silicon thin layers of different conductivity 
types on a substrate. On the other hand, a semiconductor 
optical sensor which uses a Schottky junction has the 
advantage that it can be more easily produced. The Schottky 
junction is formed, for example, by sputtering a metallic 
layer to a thickness of several nm on an N-type substrate. If 
light enters the depletion layer created by applying a 
reverse bias to a Schottky junction, electrons and holes are 
generated. The semiconductor optical sensor using a Schottky 
junction detects the light by accumulating the charge on the 
electrodes used for applying the electric field to the depletion 
layer. It is known to use an amorphous carbon layer deposited by a 
CVD method as a semiconducting layer or an insulating layer. 
The document JP-A-62-188 383, for example, describes an optically 
excited semiconductor device which is comprised of a PN 
junction semiconductor layer, a transparent electrode and an 
amorphous carbon layer disposed between them and acting as a 
barrier which has an insulating property and which is used as 
the photosensitive element. The document JP-A-63-16675  
 
describes a radiation sensor which uses an amorphous carbon 
layer as a semiconductor which generates electric charge in 
response to incident radiation. The characteristics of a semiconductor optical sensor having 
a Schottky junction between an Au thin film electrode and an 
Si substrate, strongly depend on the thickness of the Au 
electrode and, therefore, it is necessary to accurately control 
the thickness of the Au electrode. When the Au thin film 
electrode is thicker than an optimum value, the light transmissivity 
is reduced and a reduction of sensitivity incurred. 
Conversely, when the electrode layer is too thin, the junction 
is incomplete, the number of generated carriers is reduced 
by recombination and, as a result, the leakage current 
increases. In any case, since the layer thickness is small, 
the electrode must be covered with a protective layer
