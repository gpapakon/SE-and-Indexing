<ABSTRACT>
A simulator which is chemically equivalent to an explosive, but is not detonable or explodable. The simulator is a combination of an explosive material with an inert material, either in a matrix or as a coating, where the explosive has a high surface ratio but small volume ratio. The simulator has particular use in the training of explosives detecting dogs, calibrating analytical instruments which are sensitive to either vapor or elemental composition, or other applications where the hazards associated with explosives is undesirable but where chemical and/or elemental equivalence is required. The explosive simulants may be fabricated by different techniques. A first method involves the use of standard slurry coatings to produce a material with a very high binder to explosive ratio without masking the explosive vapor, and a second method involves coating inert substrates with thin layers of explosive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the detection of explosives, particularly to 
methods for the detection of explosives by instruments or dogs, and more 
particularly to explosive simulants which are chemically equivalent but not 
detonable or explodable for use in training dogs, calibrating instruments, and other 
applications where a non-explosive simulant of an explosive is needed, and to 
methods for making the simulants. These materials are referred to as Non-hazardous 
Explosives for Security, Training and Testing (NESTT). Various methods and apparatus have been developed for detecting 
explosives. As the concern of terrorist actions increases, the need to develop 
effective explosive detection increases. Most recently explosives detecting dogs and 
sensitive analytical technologies have been utilized. To enable the training of such 
dogs and/or the calibrating of sensitive instruments, it has been necessary to use 
large quantities of explosives which pose a hazard as well as preventing dog training 
or instrument utilization is some critical or restricted areas. For example, during 
the training and utilization of the dogs, quantities of explosives are carried in 
vehicles and placed in buildings which resulted in the possibility of explosive 
detonation. Whenever dogs are used to detect for illicit explosives, real explosives 
are in close proximity to verify that the dog is working and to reward the animal. 
The need for explosives thus restricts detection in populated areas such as airports.  
 
Where explosives were banned due to the location or equipment within an area, 
training could not be undertaken. Similarly, calibrating of sensitive analytical 
instruments used for the detection of explosives could only be accomplished by the 
presence of similar explosives, though in small quantities, but creating a hazard in 
and of themselves. There are many other applications that require chemical 
equivalence to explosives without the explosive hazard such as research and 
development activities in explosive destruction.and processing technologies. Thus, there has been a need to develop safe methods of training 
explosives detecting dogs and/or calibrating sensitive analytical instruments, and 
other applications, without the use of actual explosives. The present invention 
satisfies that need by providing explosive simulants which are chemically 
equivalent to explosives in nearly all respects, but cannot chemically react violently 
(no detonation or explosion). In addition to the chemical
