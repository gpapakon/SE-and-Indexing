<ABSTRACT>
A copper foil for printed circuits includes a thermal 
oxidation-resistant treated layer (e.g. Zn-Ni or Zn-Co alloy 

plating) formed on the shiny side of the foil and a Cr-base 
anticorrosive treated layer (e.g. chromate film, mixed film of 

chromium oxide and zinc and/or zinc oxide, or both) formed 
further thereon. A copper plated layer or an etched surface is 

provided on the shiny side before forming the thermal oxidation 
resistant treated layer. The copper plating or etching permits 

the shiny side to be completely covered with fresh copper or 
purified to overcome non-uniformity of chemical activity and/or 

any lack of smoothness of the entire surface of the shiny side. 
The evenness of the freshly formed copper surface enhances the 

homogeneity and completeness of the thermal oxidation-resistant 
plated layer to be formed subsequently by thermal oxidation 

resistance treatment, to maximise the advantages of this 
treatment. The treatment technique imparts to the shiny side 

of copper foil a thermal oxidation resistance to heating at 
300Â°C for 30 minutes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a copper foil for printed
circuits and a process for producing the foil, and more
specifically to a copper foil for printed circuits
characterized in that the shiny side of the foil is formed
with a copper plating layer or is etched before being treated
for thermal oxidation resistance, so as to improve its
thermal oxidation resistance (resistance to tarnishing with
oxidation due to the heat history during the fabrication of
printed circuit boards or the like), and a process for
producing the foil.Copper foils and copper alloy foils (hereinafter
collectively called "copper foils") are significantly
contributing to the progress of the electric, electronic and
related industries. Notably, they are indispensable for the
fabrication of printed circuits. Copper foil for printed
circuits generally is laminated and bonded to a base of
thermoplastic resin board, film or the like at high
temperature and high pressure, with or without the aid of an
adhesive, printed with necessary circuit patterns to form
objective circuits, and then is etched to remove unnecessary 
portions. Finally, desired elements are soldered in place,
and in this way various printed circuit boards for electronic
devices are fabricated. Qualitative requirements for the
copper foil for printed circuit boards differ with the sides,
namely, the surface of the side to be bonded to the resin
base (matt side) and the surface of the opposite side not to
be bonded to the base (shiny side).Requirements for the matt side chiefly include:
(1) No possibility of oxidative tarnishing during storage;(2) Adequate resistance to peeling from the base even after
high-temperature heating, wet treatment, soldering,
chemical treatment or the like; and(3) Freedom from so-called lamination spots that can result
from lamination to the base and etching.Requirements for the shiny side include:
(1) Good appearance and no oxidative tarnishing during
storage;(2) Good solder wettability;(3) No oxidative tarnishing upon high-temperature heating;
and(4) Good adhesion to resist.As for the thermal oxidation resistance of the shiny side,
the requirement has become more and more stringent in recent 
years. For one thing, copper foils have come to be exposed
to higher temperatures than heretofore because of the advent
of novel, highly heat-resistant resins as well as a new
manufacturing method which is known as "double-layer
flexible base process". This method comprises directly
applying a polyimide varnish to a copper foil, thereby
forming a
