<ABSTRACT>
In a radiotelephone communication system of the type having a plurality of cascaded connected base stations or microbases, a PCM link transmits a TDM signal having a plurality of frames that are divided into time slots that correspond to control time slots and voice channels. At a source base station, the frame synchronization position of the TDM signal is preferably moved to a time slot that is in the intended control time slot for a destination base station. The TDM signal is then transmitted to the destination base station, and the received TDM signal at the destination base station includes a new frame structure having consecutively renumbered time slots. The method of the present invention allows standardized equipment to be used at both the source and destination base stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR CASCADING OF MICROBASESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method for connecting base stations in a radiotelephone communication system, and more particularly, to a method for cascade connecting a plurality of base stations or icrobases in a cellular telephone system.Background of the InventionIn order to increase the capacity of cellular telephone systems, it is necessary to reduce the size of cells. Recent proposals have included the introduction of so-called microcells which include a base station and which cover an area of 100-500 meters from the base station. The typical vertical height of an antenna for a microcell base station is approximately the same as street lighting. Microcells are particularly well suited for urban areas which have a large amount of traffic and considerable amounts of interference.In order to further increase capacity, even smaller cells, often referred to as picocells, have been proposed. Picocells are primarily intended for indoor use. The base station of a picocell can cover an area of approximately 20-30 meters.Localized microcells and picocells may be established within overlying macrocells to handle areas with relatively dense concentrations of mobile users, sometimes referred to as "hot spots". Typically, microcells may be established for thoroughfares such as crossroads or streets, and a series of microcells may provide coverage of major traffic arteries such as highways. Microcells may also be assigned to large buildings, airports, and 

shopping malls. Picocells are similar to microcells, but normally cover an office corridor or a floor of a high- rise building. Microcells allow additional communication channels to be located in the vicinity of actual need, thereby increasing cell capacity while maintaining low levels of interference.The design of future cellular systems will likely incorporate acrocells, indoor microcells, outdoor microcells, public microcells, and restricted microcells. Macrocell umbrella sites typically cover radii in excess of 1 kilometer and serve rapidly moving users, for example people in automobiles. Microcell sites are usually low power, small radio base stations or microcells, which primarily handle slow moving users such as pedestrians. Each microbaÎµe of a microcell may be connected to a macrocell base station through digital radio transmissions, cables or optical fibers. Alternatively, the microbases of the microcells may be connected directly to a MSC (mobile switching
