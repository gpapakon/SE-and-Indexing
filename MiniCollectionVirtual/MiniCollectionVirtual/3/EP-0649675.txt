<ABSTRACT>
A process for improving the permselectivity of polymeric 
gas separation membranes is disclosed. The process involves contacting 

the membrane with a fluorocarbon, such as fluorinated ethers, perferably 
perfluorinated compounds, or a solution of a fluorocarbon and a caulking 

agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric gas separation
membranes and a treatment for such membranes to improve their
permselectivity with respect to at least one pair of gases in a
multicomponent gas mixture. The treatment involves applying a
fluorinated solvent, wherein fluorinated is defined as all hydrogen atoms
on each carbon atom replaced by fluorine or
all but one hydrogen atom on each atom replaced by fluorine, to the gas
separation membrane. The fluorinated solvent is capable of improving
the permeation performance of the polymeric gas separation membrane
without significantly changing or damaging the membrane morphology.
In addition, the fluorinated solvent is a vehicle for delivering a caulking
or sealing agent to the surface of the membrane.U.S. Patent 4,472,175 and U.S. Patent 4,654,055 disclose asymmetric gas
separation membranes which have been treated on one or both surfaces
with a Bronsted-Lowry acid or base, respectively, to improve the
permeation selectivity of the membrane for at least one gas of a gaseous
mixture. U.S. Patent 4,554,076 discloses a method for improving the
separatory properties of membranes by depositing on the surface of such
membrane a fluorinated amphiphilic compound in an oriented Langmuir -
Blodgett layer to increase membrane selectivity. The patent is primarily
directed to liquid-liquid separations, but gases are mentioned.
Robb, in U.S. Patent No. 3,325,330, teaches that a multicomponent gas
membrane prepared from two dense separating layers laminated together
is unlikely to have defects because defects in one dense layer are probably
not going to align with defects in the other. Browall et al., in U.S. Patents
3,874,986 and 3,980,456, extend these teachings to include multicomponent
gas membranes comprising a laminate between an asymmetric membrane
and a dense film. These teachings have been further extended to
include multicomponent gas membranes prepared by coating as asymetric
membrane with a solution which upon drying and curing forms a dense
polymeric layer (U.S. Patent 4,230,463). EP 0 422 884 A1 discloses
improving of a polymide gas separation membrane using a surfactant in a 
solvent to swell the membrane. EP 0 286090 A1 discloses a process for
repairing a composite membrane suitable for gas separation incuding a
step of contacting said membranewith a solution comprising a volatile
solvent having non solvent or mild swelling characteristics with respect of
the composite membrane material. U.S. Patent 5,032,149 teaches a
process for improving a
