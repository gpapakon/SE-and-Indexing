<ABSTRACT>
A recording/reproducing method which is capable of 
responding to the recording of various applications by 

flexibly changing the format of recording regions on a track 
of a recording medium. A track 20 is divided into a 

plurality of recording regions 22-32, and the data format 
(Figs. 2(A) and 2(B)) of each recording region is selected in 

accordance with applications to be recorded. The preamble (or 
IBG) E
PI
 is provided at the head portion of a track and the 
recording region to be independently rewritten or reloaded as 

occasion demands. A format information D
PI
 indicating the 
presence of preamble or IBG is recorded in the data region E
D
. 
By designating required number of recording regions using the 

preamble (or IBG) E

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording/reproducing
method of digital data and a recording medium, and more
particularly to an improvement of a recording/reproducing
method of digital data and a recording medium, for example,
preferably used for assigning or allocating signals of a
plurality of applications, such as audio signals and video
signals, to the recording regions on a recording medium such
as a magnetic tape.In recording audio signals and video signals onto a
magnetic tape, a normally well-known method is a helical
scanning method by which recording tracks are formed in
parallel with each other and obliquely with respect to the
tape travelling direction on the magnetic tape. Fig. 6 shows
one example of recording mode of a magnetic tape having
recording tracks formed based on such a conventional helical
scanning method. Each recording track 10 is basically divided
into two data recording regions, one being an audio recording
region 12 and the other being a video recording region 14. An
interblock gap (IBG) EI is disposed between these audio 
recording region 12 and video recording region 14.
Furthermore, a preamble EP is provided at the head of each of
these audio and video recording regions 12 and 14.The preamble EP is a portion containing information for
assisting clock signal reproduction and data extraction. The
interblock gap EI is a space for separating two blocks (audio
and video recording regions 12 and 14) of data on a magnetic
tape and for securing positional margin. In general, the size
of these audio recording region 12, video recording region 14
and interblock gap EI is fixed. In some cases, each region
designated by the preamble or the interblock gap may not be
clearly discriminated, or either one of them may be provided
for functioning for both purposes.However, according to such a conventional technology, the
position of the preamble EP or the interblock gap EI is pre-designated;
it is therefore impossible to perform a data
rewriting or data reloading operation at a position other than
the preamble EP or interblock gap EI. Meanwhile, when various
data amounts of applications are transacted, it is necessary
to change the assignment or allocation of the recording
regions in a section in accordance with data amount of each of
applications combined and recorded. To realize this, it will
be required to prepare numerous preambles and IBGs in advance,
which however results in waste of some preambles or interblock
gaps assigned or allocated at the positions where data need
not be
