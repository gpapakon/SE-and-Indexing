<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new type of process for manufacturing a ceramic-metal substrate, preferably a ceramic-copper substrate, having at least one ceramic layer which is provided on both surfaces with in each case at least one metal layer, of which at least one metal layer is formed by a metal foil or metal board which is applied flat on the one surface of the ceramic layer, the ceramic layer forming at least one edge beyond which a subregion of the one metal layer projects.

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing a ceramic-metal substrate, preferably a ceramic-copper
substrate, with at least one ceramic layer (2), which is provided with at

least one metal layer (3, 4) on each surface side, of which at least one metal

layer (3) takes the form of a metal foil or plate fastened flat to one surface side
of the ceramic layer (2), with the ceramic layer (2) forming at least one edge

(5
, 14), above which part of the metal layer (3) projects, distinguished by the
fact that when at least two metal layers (3, 4) have been deposited, one metal

layer (3) of this initial substrate (1, 1a, 1b) is permanently mechanically
deformed, using a tool (9, 17, 17
), in such a way that, following deformation,
there is an interval between this one metal layer (3), at the edge (5
, 14), and
one surface side of the ceramic layer (2) and is raised from the one surface side

along the edge (5
) over a marginal area (7) with a pre-set width.
Process as Claim 1, distinguished by the fact that the initial substrate (1, 1a, 1b)
is clamped flat, before deformation, between a first pair of tool parts (10, 11;

18, 19) of the tool (9, 17, 17
), at least in the area of the edge, with one tool
part (10, 18) fitting closely against the side of one metal layer (3) facing away

from the ceramic layer (2), and this at a distance from the edge (5
, 14) of the
ceramic layer (2), the which (distance) corresponds to the width of the

marginal area (7) referred to.
Process as Claim 1 or 2, distinguished by the fact that the tool (9) is a stamping
tool, that one tool part of the pair is provided with an aperture or recess (12) as

in a matrix, and that the deformation of the part (3
) following the clamping of
the initial substrate (1) is carried out by a stamp (13), with which the part (3
)
is pressed into the aperture or recess (12) of one tool part (10).
Process as Claim 3, distinguished by the fact that the matrix-like tool part is
simultaneously the tool part (10) clamping or supporting the initial substrate on

at least one metal layer (3). 
Process as Claim 3 or 4, distinguished by the manufacture of an initial substrate
(1), in which the ceramic layer (2) has at least one interruption, for example, in

the form of a recess or an aperture (5), which bridges the one metal layer (3)
with at least one part (3
), and in which the other metal layer (4) is likewise
interrupted in the area of the interruption (5), and in which margins of the

interruption of the ceramic layer (2) form the edges (5
), with at least one part
(3
) of one metal layer (3) being deformed in such a way that a concave bridge
(3
) is formed from the part (3') on its side facing the ceramic layer (2) and
one metal layer (3) is detached from the surface of the ceramic layer (2) at the

edges (5
) in the marginal area with a pre-set width, with the deformation of
the part (3
) into the bridge (3
) being preferably carried out using the
stamping tool.
Process as one of Claims 1-5, distinguished by the use of a bending tool with at
least one pair of tool parts (18, 19; 20, 21), of which the tool parts of a first

pair form the holding-down device (18) and the pressure pad (19), and are
clamped with the tool parts (20, 21) of a second pair forming the part (15)

projecting above the edge of the initial substrate (1a, 1b), and subsequent to
this the deformation of one metal layer (3) takes place through the movement

of at least one pair (20, 21) relative to the other pair (18, 19), with preferably
at least one pair (20, 21) being moved and / or pivoted, relative to the other

pair (18, 19) in an axial direction (A) at right angles to the plane of the ceramic
layer (2).
Process as one of Claims 1-6, distinguished by the fact that the other metal
layer (4) is fastened by its side facing away from the ceramic layer (2) to a

carrier layer, preferably to a metal plate (6), and that an aperture or bore (8) is
created in the carrier layer (6) before the part (3
) of the one metal layer (3) is
deformed, through which this deformation takes place.
Process as one of Claims 1-7, distinguished by the manufacture of an initial
substrate (1b), in which, on part of the one metal layer (3) at least, the other 

layer (4) has an interruption (23), with the ceramic layer (2) likewise being
provided with an interruption, with a slot (22) or with a predetermined

breaking point, and by the fact that subsequently the initial substrate is
deformed and / or bent, using the bending tool, in such a way that after the

bending the substrate (1b
) has a turned-down form in the area of the
interruption, the slot (22) or the predetermined breaking point, with at least

two sides, each having a metal layer (3), the ceramic layer (2) and the other
metal layer (4) and enclosing an angle between them.
Process as one of Claims 1-8, distinguished by the fact that copper residues on
the ceramic layer (2) are removed in the marginal area, using a suitable

corroding agent.
Ceramic-metal substrate obtained through the process as one of Claims 1-9.
