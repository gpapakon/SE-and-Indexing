<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at manufacturing a metal support capable of activating a catalyst in a short period of 
time, and, especially, a method of combining an insulating film-carrying heat resisting alloy having an insulating 

film consisting mainly of alumina with a heat resisting alloy by arranging a forcibly reducing metal capable of 
thermodynamically reducing alumina and a solder-laminated bond so that the forcibly reducing metal is in contact 

with the insulating film-carrying heat resisting alloy, and soldering these metals to each other by heating the same in 
a non-oxidizing atmosphere. Consequently, only the portions that are to form conductive passages in a honeycomb 

structure can be combined, and heat resisting metals having insulating oxide films on the surfaces thereof firmly so that 
they have conductivity. A preheated type metal support capable of being heated at a limited surface layer portion on 

its exhaust gas inlet side and having excellent cleaning performance can be provided by using this soldering method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
brazing a heat resisting alloy, more specifically a heat
resisting alloy having on its surface an insulating oxide
film, to a preheat type metallic carrier for the purification of an
exhaust gas, which metallic carrier has an excellent
conversion efficiency and is produced using said brazing
method, and to a process for producing such carrier.A three way catalyst of Pt, Rh, Pd, or the like has
been generally used as a catalyst for the purification of
an automobile exhaust gas. In order for the catalyst to
function, the catalyst should be heated to a temperature
of about 350 to 400Â°C. For catalytic converters in
current extensive use, a catalyst is supported on a
ceramic carrier or a metallic carrier, and the catalyst
is heated and activated by taking advantage of heat
energy of the exhaust gas per se. This is
disadvantageous in that much time is taken for the
catalyst to function after the start of an engine,
resulting in poor conversion efficiency immediately after
the start of the engine.Accordingly, in the background of tightening of
exhaust gas regulations in recent years, catalytic
converters having an excellent conversion efficiency
immediately after the start of an engine, i.e., at the
time of start of a cold engine, have been desired in that
art. One method for meeting this demand comprises
forming an insulating film on at least one of a flat
sheet (a thin flat sheet) and a corrugated sheet (a thin
corrugated sheet) in a honeycomb structure constituting a 
metallic carrier, winding the flat sheet and the
corrugated sheet in a mutually electrically insulated
state, and conducting energization in a spiral direction
to generate Joule heat which forcibly heats the catalyst,
thereby shortening the time taken for the temperature of
the catalyst to reach a value at which the catalyst
functions.PCT Publication No. 3-500911 published in Japan
(corresponding to WO-A-89/10471)
discloses a metallic carrier, having a resistance value
suitable for electric heating, wherein an insulating
layer is provided in a honeycomb structure comprising a
flat sheet and a corrugated sheet. One example of the
structure disclosed in the above publication is shown in
Fig. 1. In such a structure, insulating layers 180 are
disposed at proper intervals in a honeycomb structure 151
to form a current path as indicated by an arrow. The
electric power consumed in the current path is regulated
to 50 to 500 W which is an electric power that can be
supplied from a battery for automobiles
