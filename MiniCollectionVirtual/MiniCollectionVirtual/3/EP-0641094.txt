<ABSTRACT>
A station-to-station communication system with a built-in testing 
arrangement in at least one of the stations. The testing arrangement includes a 

transmitter/receiver pair (31, 33) with associated light/electricity and 
electricity/light transducers (29, 28) connectable at will by controlled switching 

means (32). When the transmitter/receiver paid is inter-connected, electro-optical 
light signals emitted by the transmitter are returned to the receiver and produce 

perceptible signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a station-to-station communication 
system of the kind in which each station comprises an electro-optical 
terminal unit having a transmitter with associated electricity/light transducer 
serving as light signal emitter, and/or a receiver with associated 
light/electricity transducer serving as light signal sensor, and the two stations 
are linked to each other by one or more light waveguides such as optical 
fiber. More specifically, the invention concerns built-in test means enabling 
the operator to establish whether a station of the system is functioning. There are many instances of station-to-station communication 
systems employing optical signals transmitted between the stations via one 
or more waveguides, a typical case being a remotely controlled vehicle 
which is guided from a stationary control station. In such a system, control 
signals are transmitted from the control station to the vehicle and signals 
produced by sensors in the remote vehicle, e.g. by a television camera or 
other sensor means, are transmitted from the vehicle to the control station.  
 
Another example is a point-to-point intercommunication system in which 
two users communicate directly with each other. In communication systems of this kind, it is important that the 
operator should have built-in means for testing at least one of the communicating 
stations, e.g. the control station in case of a system for the remote 
control of a moving vehicle, in order to determine whether or not that 
station is functioning properly. Known communication systems of the kind specified do not 
have a built-in testing means and it is therefore the object of the present 
invention to provide for the first time communication systems of the kind 
specified with built-in testing means in at least one of the stations. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a 
station-to-station optical communication system comprising first and second 
stations linked to each other by at least one main light waveguide and 
having each an electro-optical terminal unit holding at least one member 
selected from the group of transmitters with associated electricity/light 
transducer means serving as light signal emitters and receivers with 
associated light/electricity transducer means serving as light signal sensors, 
each of said first and second stations having light waveguide connector 
means for connection thereto of said at least one light waveguide, characterized 
by built-in electro-optical testing
