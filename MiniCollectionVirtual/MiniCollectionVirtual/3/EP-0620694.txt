<ABSTRACT>
In an optical cross-connect system, incoming and outgoing fiber 
optic trunks carrying WTDM signals are terminated to first inlet ports and 

first outlet ports of an optical space switch. A wavelength division 
demultiplexer is connected to a second outlet port of the optical space 

switch and a wavelength division multiplexer is connected to a second 
inlet port of the optical space switch. A wavelength-divided space switch 

has first inlet ports connected to the outputs of the wavelength division 
demultiplexer and first outlet ports connected to the inputs of the 

wavelength division multiplexer. A time division demultiplexer is 

connected to a second outlet port of the wavelength-divided space switch 
and a time division multiplexer is connected to a second inlet port of the 

wavelength-divided space switch. The outputs of the time division 
demultiplexer are connected to first inlet ports of a time switch and the 

inputs of the time division multiplexer are connected to first outlet ports of 
the time switch. The time switch has second inlet ports and second outlet 

ports connected to a switched network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to wavelength
routed communications networks, and more specifically to an
optical cross-connect system for switching wavelength
division multiplexed (WDM) signals.A known optical cross-connect system, as described in a
paper "Reconfigurable Wavelength Routed Optical Networks: a
Field Demonstration", H.J. Westlake et al., ECOC '91
proceedings Vol. 1, pages 753 to 756, includes an optical
space switch, a plurality of wavelength division (WD)
demultiplexers, and a plurality of wavelength division
multiplexers. As shown in the block schematic diagram of
Fig. 1 which illustrates this previous proposal, wavelength
time division multiplexed (WTDM) channels on incoming fiber
optic trunks are demultiplexed into wavelength-divided
channels by demultiplexers 2 and appear at the inlet ports
of the optical space switch 1. Some of the wavelength-divided
channels are switched to the wavelength division
mutliplexers 3 and then routed to outgoing fiber optic
trunks, and others are routed to an electronic cross-connect
system 4 where they are time-division demultiplexed for
add/drop multiplexing. Links are established in the switch
1 so that the wavelength numbers on the inlet side
correspond to those of the outlet side. If a fault occurs
on an outgoing trunk 5 and a spare outgoing trunk 6 is
available, links x1, y1 and z1 leading to the trunk 5 will
be cleared and new links x2, y2 and z2 established to the
spare trunk 6. Since this fault recovery procedure involves
one or more downstream nodes and a close coordination is
necessary to determine the alternate links in the associated
nodes, and a complex, inefficient recovery procedure will
result. If it is desired to restore all of the failed
links, it will be necessary to provide as many spare
wavelength-divided channels as there are working wavelength-divided
channels.In the specification of United States patent number
5,121,381, which was published on June 9 1992, there was
proposed an optical switching apparatus which included means
for converting serial optical or electrical signals into 
parallel signals in a time division mode, first and second
time division switch groups and a space division switch
group for cross connecting the signal of the optical or
electrical signals, and means for generating edited optical
or electrical signals as serial signals again.In a paper by R.W. Couture et al, entitled "Broadband
and Wideband DCS applications in the Asynchronous and
Synchronous Network" which was published in the Conference
Reco
