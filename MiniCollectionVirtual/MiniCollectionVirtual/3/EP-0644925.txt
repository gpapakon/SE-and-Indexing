<ABSTRACT>
Shelf-stable/biodegradable fabric softening compounds and compositions are provided comprising quaternary ammonium salt containing at least one "reverse" ester linkage. The compositions can also contain a linear alkoxylated alcohol, and a liquid carrier. These biodegradable compositions have good product stability and dispersibility, as well as excellent fabric softening characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to textile treatment compounds. 
In particular, it relates to biodegradable quaternary ammonium 
fabric softening compounds for use in textile treatment compositions 
that are used in the rinse cycle of a textile laundering 
operation to provide fabric softening/static control benefits. 
The compounds herein can also be used in hair conditioner 
compositions. Textile treatment compositions suitable for providing fabric 
softening and static control benefits during laundering are well-known 
in the art and have found wide-scale commercial application. 
Historically, rinse-added fabric softening compositions contain, 
as the active softening component, substantially water-insoluble 
cationic materials having two long alkyl chains. Typical of such 
materials are ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride and imidazolinium 
compounds substituted with two stearyl groups. These 
materials are normally prepared in the form of a dispersion in 
water. It would be desirable to have fabric softening compounds 
which are storage-stable, and also which are biodegradable. 
However, materials which may be biodegradable are often difficult 
to formulate as stable liquid compositions. The use of various quaternized ester-amines as cationic 
fabric softening agents is known in the art. See, for example, 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,339,391, Hoffmann, et al., issued July 13, 1982; 
U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,414, Chang, issued Nov. 19, 1991; 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,554, Lange et al., issued Oct. 17, 1989; 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,456,554, Walz et al., issued Jun. 26, 1984;  
 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,547, Straathof/Konig, issued Aug. 30, 1988; 
U.S. Pat. No. 3,915,867, Kang et al., issued Oct. 28, 1975; and 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,844,823, Jacques et al., issued July 4, 1989, EP 0,409,502 and WO 93/17085 (54.3 document), for a 
series of quaternized ester-amines which function as fabric 
softeners. Various quaternized ester-amines are commercially 
available under the trade names SYNPROLAM FS from ICI and REWOQUAT 
from REWO. Quaternized ester-amines are believed to be rapidly biodegradable, 
probably because they are more subject to hydrolysis 
than are conventional cationic softening agents (e.g., ditallow 
dimethyl ammonium chloride and analogs thereof). As a result of 
hydrolysis, they can encounter hydrolytic stability problems upon 
prolonged shelf storage with the product stability and viscosity 
problems becoming increasingly more unmanageable in concentrated 
aqueous dispersions. However, improved biodegradability and
