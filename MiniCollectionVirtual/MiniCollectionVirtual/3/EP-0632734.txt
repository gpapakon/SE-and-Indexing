<DESCRIPTION>
In the pharmaceutical field several lung diseases, like
bronchial asthma, are treated with powdered drugs to be
delivered, by means of dispensing inhalation devices, in
very accurate doses to be frequently repeated.A dispensing device for these drugs should guarantee an
accurate and reproducible dosage, a perfect nebulization,
which means the reduction of the powder to "respirable
particles" having a diameter of less than 7 microns,
avoiding or disintegrating eventual powder lumps, and the
powderized drug isolation from the outside environment, to
ensure its stability and preservation.These three characteristics, dosage accuracy, fineness of
nebulization and drug stability have, up to now, been
obtained all together only with the use of aerosol metered
dispensers provided with a container in which the
powderized drug is dispersed into pressurized FREON registred Trade Mark.
But the aerosol system and its relative FREON
registred Trade Mark or CFC
propellent shall not be further allowed in the near future
and furthermore the use of propellent in general requires
to add to the drug tensioactive or lubricant additives
which have shown negative side effects when inhaled.A way of administering powderized drug able to avoid the
use of CFC propellent and additives is represented by the
powder inhaler devices.The main characteristic of these devices is that the
delivery of the drug is obtained by the air flow generated
at inhalation which, passing, through a dosage chamber
containing the powderized drug, forms the particle cloud
which is then inhaled, thus avoiding the need of any
propellent.In these systems, as the powderized drug, particles often
tend to lump together forming too large particles to be
inhaled, the user has to provide an inhalation flow whose
force is enough high to first move the particles and then
disintegrate them during their run through the inhaler 
conduits.This breathing force cannot be achieved by many asthmatic
patient and therefore only very low dosage devices and drugs
have demonstrated to be enough widely usable in most of the
situations.The document WO-A-9 204 068,
which is used as a basis for the preamble of claims 1 and 2,
discloses an inhalator without
propeller gas comprising a triggerable pump which can be
manually precharged before starting inhalation and can be
triggered in synchronism with the respiration.Disadvantageously, this device is very complicated and may
therefore lead to failures and problems during the operation
and the assembly process. Furthermore, in

claims 2 and 3, wherein:


the control sleeve (45) is associated with said lever
control element (49) provided at one end with two arms (48)

diametrically opposite special slots (46), formed on the

control sleeve (45) and entering two blind holes (51) made

housing the semicylindrical vane (53), such that the

inhalation by the user creates, through the mouthpiece (57)
and the special passages in the main body (37), a

subatmospheric pressure in the control chamber (58) wich
causes the movement of the semicylindrical vane (53) from

its rest position, in which it normally closes the air inlet
slits (55), to a position in which said air can enter, with

the consequent rotation of the control lever (49) on its
fulcrum pins (50) and of the associated cams (47), which by

interacting with the upper faces (52) of the slots (46)
formed on the control sleeve (45) force the latter to shift

previously loaded by the manual compression stroke of the

cylindrical plunger (38), producing a jet of compressed air
at predetermined pressure and speed.
