<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a non-halogen 
flame retardant thermoplastic molding composition 

having in combination a high molecular weight 
linear polyester and a non-halogen flame retardant. 

The flame retardant may be either a copolymer of 
polyetherimide-organopolysiloxane or a blend 

thereof with a polyphenylene sulfide, and/or a 
polyetherimide. The molding composition of the 

invention may also contain a filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates of an improved flame 
retardant thermoplastic molding composition that 
is halogen-free and yet maintains its physical 
properties upon molding thereof. More particularly, 
the improved flame retardant composition of 
this invention is a composition of a high molecular 
weight polyester and a flame retardant amount of a 
polyetherimide-organopolysiloxane copolymer and, 
optionally, may contain in combination therewith 
polyphenylene sulfides and/or polyetherimides, and 
fillers. The molding composition of this invention 
finds use in such applications as molded articles, 
coatings such as wire jacketing, extruded tubing, 
extruded profiles, film and sheet, etc. The particular individual polymer components of 
this invention are known polymers, as well as the 
fillers, and are described in the literature. For 
example U.S. Patent 4,816,527 is a polymer blend 
of a polycarbonate and a siloxane-polyetherimide 
copolymer and is incorporated herein by reference 
with respect to the copolymer of the siloxane-polyetherimide. 
U.S. Patent 4,141,927 discloses 
blends of polyetherimides and high molecular weight 
polyesters particularly polybutylene terephthalate. Japanese patent publication JP 021506 discloses 
a thermoplastic polyester composition of a reinforcing  
 
agent, a polyphenylene sulfide and a 
polyester such as polybutylene terephthalate or 
polyethylene terephthalate. Japanese patent publication JP 63077965-A discloses 
a flame resistant polyethylene terephthalate 
and a polyphenylene sulfide resin containing 
brominated polystyrene and a filler. The brominated 
polystyrene is the flame retardant additive. U.S. Patent 4,689,365 discloses a fiber reinforced 
polybutylene terephthalate molding composition 
blended with a polyphenylene sulfide to 
improve resistance to the vapour phase soldering 
process. U.S. Patent 4,450,266 discloses a composition 
of siloxane compounds as stabilizers for parapolyphenylene 
sulfides and mixtures with thermoplastic 
polycarbonates, polyesters and polyester-carbonates. Brominated flame retardants, which are well 
known in the art, have been particularly successful 
as flame retardant additives. However, because 
the concern of the impact that 
bromine and other halogens might have on the 
environment, there is a definite need for alternative 
non-halogen flame retardant systems. In 
addition, such halogen containing compounds 
generate corrosive by products during processing or 
when exposed to fire which can result in damage to 
sensitive
