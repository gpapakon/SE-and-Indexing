<ABSTRACT>
The improvements comprise the integration of the whole control system within a 
prismatic-rectangular vertically elongate casing (1), wherein the electronic coin selector (2) 

is provided in the top part, and immediately under said selector a sorter (8) whose channels 
are controlled by electromagnets, said sorting device being assisted by a display (9) 

and a group of push-buttons (10) and in the bottom part of the casing, under the sorting 
device (8), there is provided a series of storage tubes (11) corresponding to respective return 

mechanisms, a unit (12) for the temporary storage of coins, as well as at least one 
groove (14) in one of the side walls of the case (1), which groove allows to provide for the 

optional coupling of an external return device (13) and which, through a guide (15), supplies 
the coins to the return passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a series of improvements 
introduced in coin control systems for automatic machines, that 
is, machines capable of supplying a product or service prior the 
introduction therein of a coin or collection of coins, the said 
improvements affecting both the coin validation systems and the 
systems for storing the coins and paying out prizes or returns. In automatic machines of the type mentioned hereinbefore, 
such as for example games machines, tobacco or drinks dispensing 
machines, etc., a series of mechanisms such as a selector for 
detecting the passage of each coin, verifying the validity or 
invalidity thereof, and, as the case may be, valuating same, a 
classifier to separate coins of different values, channelling 
same towards a different receptacle, several storage boxes for 
coins of different values, designed to supply the said coins 
again towards the outside, generally for returns or "change", 
means for returning the coins introduced to the user when the 
machine is unable to supply the desired product, etc., are 
absolutely necessary. At present, all of such elements constitute a separate 
arrangement wherein the said elements, though functionally 
interrelated, are totally independent from a physical point of 
view, each being located in the most appropriate area of the 
machine and being suitably fitted thereat, this implying an 
extremely complex assembly, which furthermore varies from one  
 
type of machine to another, thereby complicating matters even 
further. The improvements proposed by the invention have been 
designed to fully solve these problems, in such a way that the 
coin control system constitutes a compact device wherein the 
different elements comprising same can be assembled separately 
before definitive assembly of the whole system in any machine, 
the said elements adopting a rational distribution in order to 
achieve a smaller volume of ocupation, that is, to form a block 
of small dimensions, easy to install within any machine, and 
with optimum characteristics from a functional point of view. More specifically, and in order to achieve the above, the 
improvements proposed by the invention consist in the 
arrangement of the different operative elements of the control 
system within a rectangular prismatic and vertically elongated 
frame box, on the upper surface whereof there is provided and 
fitted an electronic coin selector, the access slot thereof 
projecting from the upper surface of the said frame box, as does 
the button for

<CLAIMS>
Improvements introduced in coin control systems for 
automatic machines, essentially characterised in that they 

consist in the provision of a prismatic rectangular and 
vertically elongated frame box, on the upper surface of which 

is established a coin selector, preferably of the electronic 
type, the slot for introduction of the coins and the buttons for 

return of rejected coins thereof projecting through openings 
operatively provided on the upper surface of the said frame 

box, there being provided on the middle section thereof, 
immediately below the selector, a classifier, being preferably 

of the type provided with electromagnets for deviating and 
classifying the coins, and which is aided by an alphanumeric 

display which is capable of showing messages and performing 
certain functions, the said classifier opening into a lower duct 

which channels the coins into a definitive collecting tin or box 
and over a series of vertical tubes established in the lower 

section of the frame box and corresponding to respective return 

mechanisms, a module for temporary storage of coins being 
likewise established in this lower section of the frame box to 

allow return of the coins introduced by the user when the 
machine is unable to supply the desired product or service, the 

existence on at least one of the side walls of the frame box of 
means for coupling external return mechanisms having been 

foreseen, which return mechanisms unload the coins through a 
slot operatively provided on the side walls of the said frame 

box onto a guiding ramp which leads them towards the coin return 
duct, with the special particularity that the closing cover of 

the said frame box comprises openings for visual control of the 
display and for acting on the buttons related thereto, as well 

as vertical slots for visual control of the contents of the 
return tubes.
