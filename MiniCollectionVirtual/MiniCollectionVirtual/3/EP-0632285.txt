<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) apparatus used in the field for
analyzing a sample of low concentration with the use of
a superconducting magnet, and more specifically to a
structure of a sensitive sample tube used in a nuclear
magnetic resonance apparatus and a method for
manufacturing the sample tube.In general, a nuclear magnetic resonance
apparatus is required to use a sample tube having a
thinnest possible wall thickness in order to make a
sensitive measurement because a detector using the
sample tube usually sets the outer diameter of the test
tube to be very small such as, for example, 5 mm to 10
mm. Therefore, sample tubes, which are conventionally
used as thin wall tube, are formed of a special hard
glass material or the like with the wall thickness of
the sample tubes as thin as 0.4 mm.However, sample tubes with a further reduced
wall thickness than mentioned above, such as the ultra
thin wall, are fragile which makes it very difficult to
use in comparison to a conventional thin wall tube.
Therefore, even further reductions in the wall 
thickness of the ultra thin wall sample tubes is
naturally limited. Also, the conventional ultra thin
wall sample tube is made such that it has a uniform
wall thickness over the entire body thereof, in order
to obtain a sensitive measurement, in spite of the fact
that a sample measurement by a nuclear magnetic
resonance apparatus is actually carried out with
respect to a very limited part (sample receiving
chamber) in the vicinity of a bottom portion of the
sample tube. This makes it even more difficult to make
the sample tube, which is liable to break during the
process of manufacture. Furthermore, since such sample
tubes are manufactured on a small production basis by
experienced and skilled workers, the production costs
are prohibitively high. Moreover, an opening area of
such sample tubes can easily break. Several times of
use makes it practically impossible to use them even if
handling is made with utmost care. In addition, it is
difficult to cut such a thin tube, particularly at the
opening area. Therefore, a specially-designed cutting
machine is required. The need for the use of such a
special cutting machine again results in increased
production costs.The present invention has been accomplished
in view of the above.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide a sample tube for use in a nuclear
magnetic resonance apparatus, in which a higher
sensitivity measurement can be achieved and which has a
mechanical

<CLAIMS>
A sample tube (1) for the use in a nuclear magnetic
resonance apparatus comprising a sample tube made of a glass

or quartz material, said sample tube having a sample
receiving chamber (3) defined therein, a wall thickness of said

sample receiving chamber being thinner than a wall thickness
of the remaining portion of said sample tube.
A sample tube according to claim 1, in which the
wall thickness of the remaining portion of the sample tube is

at least 0.4 mm.
A sample tube according to claim 1 or 2, in which
the wall thickness of the receiving chamber is no greater

than 0.3 mm.
A method for manufacturing a sample tube for the
use in a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus comprising the

steps of:

inserting a core bar (4) into a tubular body (1H) made of a
glass or quartz material, said core bar having a stepped

portion (4a), that portion of said core bar with the stepped
portion corresponding to a sample receiving chamber (3) being

larger in diameter than the remaining portion;
gradually inserting said tubular body into an
electric furnace (6) for heating while allowing suction from a

vacuum pump to act on the interior of said tubular body,
thereby the whole tubular body being intimately attached for

shaping to and along an outer peripheral surface of said core
bar;
withdrawing said core bar outside from a lower end
opening (1H
g
) of said tubular body;
sealing by heating said lower end opening of said
tubular body to form a bottom (1H
e
) of the tube; and
grinding the peripheral surface so that the whole
tubular body will be equal in outer diameter.
A method according to claim 4, in which the
resulting thickness of the bottom of the tube is no greater

than 0.3 mm. 
A method according to claim 4 or 5, in which the

resulting thickness of the tubular body above the lower end
is at least 0.4 mm.
