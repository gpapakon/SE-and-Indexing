<ABSTRACT>
A device for vehicles having a braking system comprising a pneumatic brake servo (1) and a master-cylinder (2) enables the braked vehicle to be held on a slope. It comprises a slope-sensitive valve (12) preventing the servo (1) from returning to its rest position under certain conditions.

<CLAIMS>
A braking device for motor vehicles, which in 
particular is equipped with a brake pedal (9) and a 

pneumatic brake-booster (1), the latter in turn 
comprising: 


first and second chambers (3a, 3b) sealingly 
separated by a movable wall (4) and connected, 

permanently in the case of the first and selectively by 
operation of the pedal in the case of the second, to 

respective first and second pressure sources (S, A) 
delivering pressures the difference between which is not 

zero, the operation of the pedal enabling brake-boosting 
work to occur as the result of a displacement of the 

movable wall through the action of said pressure 
difference; 
first pedal-controlled valve means (7a, 7b) for 
establishing selective communication between the two 

chambers, this communication being interrupted from the 
commencement of each operation of the pedal and being 

restored only at the end of its release; 
second pedal-controlled valve means (7a, 7c) 
for establishing selective communication between the 

second chamber and the second pressure source, this 
communication being established in the course of each 

operation of the pedal and interrupted on the 
commencement of its release, and 
third valve means (12) connected in series with 
the first valve means and adapted to establish additional 

selective communication between the chambers, 
 
characterized in that the third valve means comprise an 

inclinometric valve reacting to the inclination of the 
vehicle to prevent, at least in a determined direction 

and at a determined amplitude of inclination of the 
vehicle, communication between the two chambers. 
Braking device according to claim 1, intended for 
a motor vehicle equipped with a clutch mechanism (25), 

characterized in that in addition it comprises control 
means (24, 22, 21, 20) reacting to a movement of said  

 
mechanism to bring about the opening of the third valve 

means in response to said movement.
