<ABSTRACT>
An orthodontic buccal tube device (10) adapted to cooperate with an 
arch wire and comprising a base member (11) for attachment 

to a tooth, and a 
body member (14) which is fixed to the base member and which 

comprises a 
bore (16) adapted to accommodate an end portion of the arch wire. 

The device 
comprises an auxiliary member (18) fixed to or integral with 

either the base 
member or the body member and is adapted for cooperation with an end of 

the wire (15) protruding from the bore to either limit the 
rearward movement of 

the wire, or exert a force bringing to the development of a moment in the 
wire, or both. The auxiliary member is also useful in forming an abutment 

in the direction of the buccal-mucosa, for ensuring appropriate distance 
between the buccal-mucosa and the end of the wire so as to avoid injuries 

to said mucosa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of orthodontic buccal tube
appliances and more specifically it is directed to an improvement thereof for
assisting with orthodontic corrections and decreasing of oral injuries by
orthodontic wires.One of the most exercised orthodontic techniques is the so-called
"sliding mechanics" according to which different types of brackets and
appliances are attached in appropriate positions onto teeth and at least on
both end molar teeth of a treated jaw which serve as anchors, with an arch-shaped
wire (hereinafter in the description and claims to be referred to as an
"arch wire"), held in a suitable groove within each of said brackets and 
retained thereto by a ligature member. Accordingly, all tooth movements
such as straightening, leveling, rotating and arch forming of the teeth is
obtained subject to the stresses applied thereon by the arch wire.The last orthodontic appliance attached to a molar tooth on each
side of a jaw is a tubular element which slidingly accommodates an end of
the arch wire.After the arch wire is placed within the brackets and fastened
thereto by a ligature member such as a rubber band or a ligature wire or
other means as known per se, the excessive length of the arch wire
projecting at the rear of the tube is cut by a suitable cutter, leaving a
protruding bit of 0.5 to 1.5 mm long.When the dislocated teeth begin moving towards their correct
position, the length of the arch wire between the tubes changes and may
shorten as a result of which the protruding portion behind the tube
appliances increases. Such an increasement depends on the rate of
movement of the dislocated teeth depending also on the amount of force
applied by external means, e.g. tensioned rubber bands and the patient's
physiological response of bone to such force.A significant character which should be kept throughout an
orthodontic treatment is the arch shape of the arch wire which is a super-elastic
metal or a shape memory metal which should be kept symmetrically
about the axis of symmetry of the treated jaw. Failing to keep the arch wire
in such symmetry will eventually yield to a asymmetric dental arch of the
treated jaw.However, the use of tubed appliances with the sliding mechanics
technique involves some serious drawbacks concerning both the speed and
effectiveness of an orthodontic treatment as well as the comfort and the
possible oral injury of the patient. One problem occurs when the arch wire slides out of its
symmetric position with respect to that of the treated jaw, in
