<ABSTRACT>
A paper sack to be used for flour (or other granular or particulate 
material), having single - or multi-ply walls, has a pasted block bottom. 

The block bottom is designed so that it can be readily torn open to 
allow the sack contents to be poured out avoiding contamination by 

adhesive or torn paper fragments.
 

Two identical tapezium-shaped flaps (J,K) form the block bottom and onto 
these is pasted a rectangular label (R) leaving an un-pasted gap (S) 

where one can insert one's hand and pull open the pouring opening (P).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-wall paper sacks - a 
multi-wall paper sack being defined for the purposes of 
this specification as one having one or more walls. It is known for paper sacks to be used for flour (or 
other granular or particulate material, hereinafter 
comprised within the term "flour") intended to be used 
for human consumption. Such sacks commonly have 
so-called "pasted bottoms", by which is meant that the 
bottoms of the sacks are stuck down with paste or other 
adhesive. It is also known for such sacks to be designed 
so that the bottoms of the sacks can be readily torn open 
to pour out the flour. It is important for the flour not 
to be contaminated by the adhesive or by torn paper 
fragments and for the flour not to come into contact with 
any foreign thing or object or any part of a person, such 
as the hands, when the sack is opened.. It is an object of the invention to provide a paper sack 
having a pasted bottom and suitable for sacking flour 
intended for human consumption. This is not to be interpreted as excluding other possible 
uses for the sack.  According to the invention, there is provided a sack as 
claimed in claim 1, to which reference is directed. The invention will be described by way of example with 
reference to the drawings, wherein: - 
FIG. 1 illustrates a paper tube after a first, 
conventional, opening-out-and-folding step has been 
performed in the conversion of the tube into a sack 
embodying the invention, and showing where the next fold 
is to be made in accordance with the invention; FIG. 2 shows the tube after the next fold has been made 
and showing where the fold after that, the penultimate 
fold, is to be made; FIG. 3 shows the tube after the last-mentioned, 
penultimate, fold has been made and showing a pasted 
label applied; and FIG. 4 is a view corresponding to Fig. 3 from the other 
side of the sack and showing the position of the final 
fold. Referring to the drawings, the sack embodying the 
invention is a two-sided sack, made accordingly from a 
two-sided paper tube A, one side B of which (the "face", 
see Fig. 4) is joined directly to the other side C  
 
thereof (the "reverse side" or "seamed side", see Figs. 1 
- 3) along two side edge folds D and E. Figs. 1 - 3 show 
the seam F of the reverse, or seamed, side C. The paper 
tube A is actually double walled, that is, formed by two 
separate paper tubes, one slightly smaller than, and 
inside, the other, but these two separate tubes are not 
shown as such. The drawings depict the

<CLAIMS>
A paper sack having a first side (B) joined 
directly to a second side (C) along two side edge folds 

(D, E) and having a pasted bottom formed from first and 
second trapezium-shaped flaps (J, K) formed by an 

opening-out and folding step; 
   the two said flaps (J, K) comprising two respective 

trapezium-shaped panels (J1, K1) formed, the first one 
from part of said first side (B) and the second one from 

part of said second side (C); 
   each said flap (J, K) also comprising two 

respective halves (J2, J3; K2, K3) of two triangular 
panels (L1, L2;) which adjoin said trapezium-shaped 

panels (J1, K1) along four 45° folds (i, j, k, l); 
   the bases (a-h-g-d) of the two trapezium-shaped 

flaps being closely adjacent each other; 
   a bottom edge (G, H) of each side (B, C) having an 

intermediate portion (G3, H3) parallel to the bases 
(a-h-g-d) of the two said flaps (J, K) and two side 

portions (G1, G2, H1, H2) perpendicular thereto; 
   the first flap (J) being folded on a first one (O) 

of three further folds (O, Q, O) to bring the 
intermediate bottom edge portion (G3) of said first side 

(B) closer to the intermediate bottom edge portion (H3) 
of said second side (C);

 
   adhesive (M, N) causing to be adhered together 

facing portions of said two triangular panels (L1, L2) 
between said first one (O) and a second one (Q) of said 

three further folds; 
   an outlet aperture (P) being defined by a rectangle 

(b-c-e-f-b) formed by the two intermediate bottom edge 
portions (G3, H3) and by parts of the two side portions 

(H1, H2) of the bottom edge (H) of said second side (C); 
   there being no adhesive in the immediate vicinity 

of said outlet aperture (P); 
   the two said flaps then being folded in an opposite 

direction about the second one (Q) of said three further 
folds, said second one (O) of said three further folds 

being between the intermediate bottom edge portion (G3) 
of said first side (B) and the bases (a-h-g-d) of the two 

trapezium-shaped flaps (J, K), to bring an edge portion 
of the second trapezium-shaped flap (K), but no portion 

of the first trapezium-shaped flap (J), across the first 
one (O) of said three further folds (O, Q, O); 

   an adhesive-coated sheet (R) being applied over 
said second trapezium-shaped flap (K); 

   and edge portions of said second trapezium-shaped 

flap (K) and said sheet (R) being folded in the third one 
(O) of said three further folds about said first one (O) 

of said folds, in the same direction as the second one 
(Q) of said folds, stuck down adhesively by side edge 

portions of said sheet (R). 
A paper sack as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
first side (B) is a face of the sack and the second side 

(C) is a seamed side or reverse side of the sack. 
A paper sack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a 
small amount of adhesive (M1, N1) is provided on the far 

side of said second fold (Q) from said first fold (O). 
A paper sack as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the sack has two or more walls, with flush-cut 

ends.
