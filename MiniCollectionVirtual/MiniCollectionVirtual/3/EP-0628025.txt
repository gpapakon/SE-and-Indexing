<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of purified 6-aminocapronitrile 
from a mixture containing tetrahydroazepine (THA) by 
converting the THA to higher boiling compounds and then recovering 6-aminocapronitrile 
by controlled distillation. The 6-aminocapronitrile is then 
sufficiently pure to be polymerized to a high molecular weight 6-nylon having good 
color and low gel content. The polymerization of 6-aminocapronitrile to form nylon polymer is 
disclosed in Greenewalt U.S. Patent 2,245,129 and Curatolo et al. U.S. Patent 
4,568,736. When 6-aminocapronitrile is produced by partial hydrogenation of 
adiponitrile, hexamethylenediamine and tetrahydroazepine, i.e., the latter 
compound represented by the formula: 
 
also coproduced. The hexamethylenediamine is easily removed from the mixture 
by simple distillation, but the tetrahydroazepine (hereinafter sometimes referred to 
as THA) is not easily separated. The presence of THA in the 6-aminocapronitrile 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 6-ACN) that is to be polymerized limits the 
molecular weight of the polymer and causes color and branching in the polymer. It 
is, therefore important that THA be removed from the 6-ACN before 
polymerization. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple and 
efficient method of obtaining 6-ACN that is free from THA. It has now been found that by heating, 6-ACN to about 235 degrees 
C (approximately the atmospheric pressure boiling point of 6-ACN) the contained 
THA is slowly converted to compounds which can be separated from 6-ACN by 
simple distillation. Certain organic compounds can be added to the 6-ACN to 
reduce the time required to convert the THA.  
 The present invention is a process for the recovery of 6-aminocapronitrile 
from a mixture containing 6-aminocapronitrile and 
tetrahydroazepine which comprises (a) heating said mixture at a temperature of 
about 235 degrees C to convert tetrahydroazepine to higher boiling compounds 
and (b) then distilling the 6-aminocapronitrile from the resulting mixture. The 
presence of certain organic compounds in the mixture increases the speed at which 
the tetrahydroazepine is converted. Suitable organic compounds are compounds 
that will react with 6-ACN to from an imine. These imines are thermally unstable, 
and their by-products react with THA preferentially. Such compounds usually 
contain carbonyl groups: ketones and aldehydes. The amount of organic compound 
is preferably 0.1 to 10 % by weight of the initial mixture. Temperature: Temperatures
