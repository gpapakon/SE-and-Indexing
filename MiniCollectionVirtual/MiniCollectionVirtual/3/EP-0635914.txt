<ABSTRACT>
Flexible strip (1) on which the electrical connectors 
(5) are arranged at uniform intervals and placed 

mechanically without the aid of adhesive substances and/or 
fixing elements. The strip (1) has, at uniform distances, 

openings (3) in which the electrical connectors are placed; 
the contour of the openings (3) is studied so as to ensure 

simple and reliable containment of the connector (5) and an 
equally easy and immediate extraction thereof. The contours 

blanked in the flexible strip are mostly provided, at their 
ends, with oppositely arranged protrusions (10) that face 

the mostly circular openings of the connectors (5) in order 
to retain them. Other mostly circular openings (8) are 

blanked in the flexible strip (1) at a constant pitch, 
mostly alternated with the openings (3) for positioning the 

electrical connectors, and are used for the traction and 
positioning of the strip (1) in the apparatus for 

automatically fixing the connector (5) to the electrical 
conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a strip for electrical 
connectors. As is known, electrical connectors having the most 
disparate shapes and suitable for various types for 
electrical connection are already commercially available and 
are supplied loose, for individual application; one of the 
most popular electrical connectors is the terminal in which 
the stem is electrically insulated by PVC or nylon tubular 
sheets, and the present invention relates mainly to these. The increasingly frequent use of automatic devices for 
applying connectors has led to the need to uniformly join 
said connectors with a strip-like configuration, so as to 
provide coils or ribbons which are easily insertable in the 
loading units of automatic application machines. Some of the known solutions use a strip for insulated 
electrical connectors which is constituted by a plurality of 
insulated connectors arranged side by side and mutually 
joined by means of a ribbon which is formed monolithically 
with the insulating sleeve and consequently provides 
continuity despite offering the possibility of easily 
folding the strip. With this type of arrangement, first of all there are 
considerable problems during pressing, since the joining 
ribbon and the sleeve must be formed monolithically, with 
consequent complications of the die, and secondly the 
automatic machine for applying the terminal must have 
blanking means to blank the ribbon during application. Other solutions already in use entail the fixing for 
electrical connectors to a flexible strip with additional  
 
materials such as staples, adhesive tapes or glues, et 
cetera. The aim of the present invention is to solve the 
problems described above by providing a strip for electrical 
connectors that allows to automatically load application 
machines by mutually joining the various connectors with a 
uniform spacing, without using complicated dies to provide 
the connection. Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of 
the invention is to provide a strip for electrical 
connectors in which it is possible to join, in an orderly 
manner and with uniform spacing, a plurality of 
conventional-type electrical connectors manufactured 
entirely according to conventional techniques. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
strip for electrical connectors which, by virtue of its 
particular constructive characteristics, is capable of 
giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in 
use. Another object of the present invention is to

<CLAIMS>
Strip (1) for electrical connectors, particularly 
pre-insulated terminals, characterized in that it comprises 

a band (2) made of a material which is flexible at least 
along its longitudinal extension and forms a plurality of 

mutually parallel and spaced openings (3) having, in two 
oppositely arranged points, protrusions (10) that can 

detachably engage the axial ends of the sleeve (4) of a 
terminal (5) and the like to detachably retain a plurality 

of mutually spaced terminals (4) arranged side by side. 
Strip according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the axis of said openings (3) is arranged substantially at 

right angles to the longitudinal extension of said band (2). 
Strip according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises uniformly spaced 

perforations (8) arranged between said openings (3). 
Strip according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said protrusions (10) are 

arranged substantially on the axis of said openings (3). 
Strip according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said openings (3) have a shape 

that is substantially complementary to the outer surface of 
said sleeve (4). 
Strip according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said protrusions (10) are 

laterally provided with indentations (11) for engagement 
with the axial edges of said sleeve (4).
