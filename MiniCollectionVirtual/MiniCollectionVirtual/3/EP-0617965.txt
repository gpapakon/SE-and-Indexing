thereof as active constituent, and a pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier or diluent, and to Clara cell protein CC10 

or an active derivative thereof for use as medicine, such as 
for use: 


i) in preventing tissue rejection after transplantation; 
ii) for treatment of infertility, septic shock, allergy, 
biliary cirrhosis, myasthenia gravis; or 
iii) to prevent premature birth, abortion by Gram-negative 
septicaemia, 
and for use as diagnostic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
preparation based on Clara cell protein CC10 and to the use
of Clara cell protein CC10 as a medicament and diagnosticum.Clara cell protein CC10, also called urinary protein 1,
or simply CC10 or CC16, is known from the literature (Singh
G. et al., Biochimica Biophysica Acta 950 [1988] 329-337).
Clara cell protein CC10 is a homodimeric disulphide-linked
polypeptide (Mr 2 x 7900) which occurs in several biological
fluids, such as sputum, urine, semen and in the mucous
membranes of the airways.In sputum the Clara cell protein CC10 concentration
amounts to an average 15 mg/l. The concentration in urine is
greater in males (30 µg/l) than in females (0.5 µg/l), these
differences becoming maximal at puberty. In addition, the
concentration of Clara cell protein CC10 in the urine rises
during pregnancy.Little is known about the biological function of Clara
cell protein CC10 at this moment.
CA 147437h, vol.113, page 293,(1990) reports the exacerbation of
carragenan-induced foot pad swelling.The present invention is based on the discovery that
Clara cell protein CC10 inhibits the production of interferon-gamma
(= IFN-gamma) of activated mononuclear cells.
This inhibition is maximal when interleucine 2 (IL-2) is used
for stimulation. Clara cell protein CC10 inhibits on the one
hand the IL-2 production but in particular blocks the
interaction of IL-2 with target cells or a combination of
both.It has been found from this discovery, that Clara cell
protein CC10 acts as an immuno-suppressive agent as a result
of its anti-cytokine action.A pharmaceutical
preparation contains Clara cell protein CC10 or an
active derivative thereof as active constituent, and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. This
pharmaceutical preparation can be used in the treatment of
organisms, in particular humans and animals, as a medicine or
diagnostic.The pharmaceutical preparation can contain the Clara
cell protein CC10 in combination with any pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier or diluent.The dosage forms can consist of tablets, granules,
inhalable powder, aerosols, parenterally, intramuscularly,
intravenously administrable fluids, and such like. Particular
preference is given to injectable fluids which are isotone
and optionally buffered in usual manner.The pharmaceutical preparation can be administered in
a suitable dosage form in a quantity dependent on the
concentration of the active constituent of Clara cell protein
CC10. This quantity generally amounts to less than 10 mg/kg
