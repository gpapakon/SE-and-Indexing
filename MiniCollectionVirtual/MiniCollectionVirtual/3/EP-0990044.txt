<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for in vitro evolution of protein function. In particular, the method relates to the shuffling of nucleotide segments obtained from exonuclease digestion. The present inventors have shown that polynucleotide fragments derived from a parent polynucleotide sequence digested with an exonuclease can be combined to generate a polynucleotide sequence which encodes for a polypeptide having desired characteristics. This method may be usefully applied to the generation of new antibodies or parts thereof having modified characteristics as compared to the parent antibody.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for in vitro
molecular evolution of protein function, in particular by
shuffling of DNA segments obtained using an exonuclease.Protein function can be modified and improved in vitro
by a variety of methods, including site directed
mutagenesis (Alber et al, Nature, 5; 330(6143):41-46, 1987)
combinatorial cloning (Huse et al, Science, 246:1275-1281,
1989; Marks et al, Biotechnology, 10: 779-783, 1992) and
random mutagenesis combined with appropriate selection
systems (Barbas et al, PNAS. USA, 89: 4457-4461, 1992).The method of random mutagenesis together with
selection has been used in a number of cases to improve
protein function and two different strategies exist.
Firstly, randomisation of the entire gene sequence in
combination with the selection of a variant (mutant)
protein with the desired characteristics, followed by a new
round of random mutagenesis and selection. This method can
then be repeated until a protein variant is found which is
considered optimal (Schier R. et al, J. Mol. Biol. 1996 263
(4): 551-567). Here, the traditional route to introduce
mutations is by error prone PCR (Leung et al, Technique, 1:
11-15, 1989) with a mutation rate of â‰ˆ0.7%. Secondly,
defined regions of the gene can be mutagenized with
degenerate primers, which allows for mutation rates up to
100% (Griffiths et al, EMBO. J, 13: 3245-3260, 1994; Yang
et al, J. Mol. Biol. 254: 392-403, 1995). The higher the
mutation rate used, the more limited the region of the gene
that can be subjected to mutations.Random mutation has been used extensively in the field
of antibody engineering. In vivo formed antibody genes can
be cloned in vitro (Larrick et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res.
Commun. 160: 1250-1256, 1989) and random combinations of
the genes encoding the variable heavy and light genes can 
be subjected to selection (Marks et al, Biotechnology, 10:
779-783, 1992). Functional antibody fragments selected can
be further improved using random mutagenesis and additional
rounds of selections (Schier R. et al, J. Mol. Biol. 1996
263 (4): 551-567).The strategy of random mutagenesis is followed by
selection. Variants with interesting characteristics can
be selected and the mutated DNA regions from different
variants, each with interesting characteristics, are
combined into one coding sequence (Yang et al, J. Mol.
Biol. 254: 392-403, 1995). This is a multi-step sequential
process, and potential synergistic effects of different
mutations in different regions can be lost, since they are
not
