<ABSTRACT>
In a color cathode ray tube apparatus, a main 
electron lens unit for converging three in-line electron 

beams on a phosphor screen is formed of a plurality of 
electrodes (G51, G52, G6), including at least first, 

second, and third electrodes, which are arranged from 
the cathode side toward the phosphor screen. An 

asymmetric electron lens, which horizontally diverges 
and vertically converges the electron beams, is formed 

on the cathode side in a lens effect region of a first 
electron lens composed of the second and third 

electrodes (G52, G6), and an asymmetric second electron 
lens, which has one effect with respect to the 

horizontal direction of the electron beams and another 
with respect to the vertical direction (G51, G52), is 

formed between the first and second electrodes, at the 
least. 
In this arrangement, the effects of the second 
lens to converge and diverge the electron beams in the 

horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, are 
enhanced, and the effects of the first electron lens are 

attenuated, depending on the deflection of the electron 
beams by means of a deflection yoke. Thus, the 

horizontal and vertical diameters of beam spots at the 
peripheral portion of a picture can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode
ray tube apparatus as defined in the preamble portion of claim 1, and
more particularly, to a cathode
ray tube apparatus using a dynamic-focus system for
correcting deflective aberration which is caused by a
magnetic field generated by means of a deflection yoke.In general, a color cathode ray tube apparatus
comprises an envelope which is composed of a panel 1 and
a funnel 2 bonded integrally to the panel, as shown in
FIG. 1. Formed on the inner surface of the panel 1 is a
phosphor screen 3, composed of three stripe- or dot-shaped
phosphor layers of different colors which emit
blue, green, and red light beams. A shadow mask 4,
having a number of electron beam holes therein, is
attached to the inside of the phosphor screen 3 so as to
face it. Located in a neck 5 of the funnel 2 is an
electron gun assembly 7 for emitting three electron
beams 6B, 6G and 6R. The electron beams 6B, 6G and 6R
emitted from the electron gun assembly 7 are deflected
by means of horizontal and vertical deflecting magnetic
fields, which are generated from a deflection yoke 8
attached to the outside of the funnel 2, and are landed
on the phosphor screen 3 through the shadow mask 4. As
the screen 3 is scanned horizontally and vertically, a
color image is displayed thereon.As the currently prevailing apparatus constructed
in this manner, there is a color cathode ray tube 
apparatus of the self-convergence in-line type in which
the electron gun assembly 7, in particular, is formed of
an in-line assembly for emitting three in-line electron
beams including a center beam 6G and a pair of side
beams 6B and 6B which pass along one horizontal plane.
In this apparatus, moreover, the horizontal and vertical
deflecting magnetic fields generated from the deflection
yoke 8 are pincushion-shaped and barrel-shaped,
respectively, so that the three in-line electron beams
6B, 6G and 6R can be concentrated on the whole surface
of the phosphor screen 3 by means of the irregularly
shaped magnetic fields.In this self-convergence, in-line apparatus,
however, beam spots 10b at the peripheral portion of a
picture are distorted under the influence of deflective
aberration, i.e. astigmatism aberration, of the
deflecting magnetic fields, so that the resolution of
the peripheral portion of the picture is lowered,
although each beam spot 10a at the central portion of
the picture has the shape of a perfectly round circle.
Thus, even though the beam spot 10a is shaped like a
circle, as shown in the graph of FIG. 2A
