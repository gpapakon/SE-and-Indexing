<ABSTRACT>
1. Pneumatic vehicle tyre with a carcass (2) of a radial design and a belt which is arranged radially outside the carcass and consists of at least two belt layers which are arranged radially one on top of the other and have in each case individual filaments which are arranged parallel to one another within the belt layers and consist of metal mesh which extend in each case from the one belt side, bounding the belt axially, obliquely to the other belt side which bounds the belt axially, at an angle to the circumferential direction in the circumferential plane, the individual filament of two layers which are arranged radially one on top of the other being aligned diagonally with respect to one another and the individual filaments being constructed in a wave shape or in the shape of a helix with amplitides which are arranged distributed at least in the circumferential plane, being unordered in the circumferential direction.
