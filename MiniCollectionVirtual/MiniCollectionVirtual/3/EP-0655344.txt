<ABSTRACT>
A method of printing at least two dots of ink sequentially at a 
particular location to form a spot on an ink-receptive transparent 

medium by an ink-jet printer comprising printing a first dot of ink at 
said location during a first scan of a line, delaying a time 

sufficiently long to allow the first dot of ink to absorb into said 
ink-receptive medium, and printing a second dot of ink at said location 

over said first dot of ink during a second scan of said line, said dot 
separated from an adjacent dot by a dot-to-dot spacing as measured by 

the number of dots per unit length, wherein an amount of ink which is 
required to generate a printed dot of diameter ø meets the condition 

ø≦1/D, where D is the number of dots per unit length.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to ink-jet devices, such as
ink-jet printers, and, more particularly, to methods of
enhancing and optimizing image density on transparent
media, such as surface-modified polyester films for use in
overhead transparency projection.The use of ink-jet printers to form images such as
alpha-numeric characters and graphics on absorbent media
such as paper is well-known.However, the use of the same inks on transparent
media, such as polyester films, commonly known as Mylar,
has not produced the same high optical density of print,
which results in intense colors, obtained with inherently
absorbent media. As is currently available, such non-absorbing
media, even when an "ink-receptive" coating is
applied, suffer from inherently long drying times, moisture
sensitivity, non-homogeneous area fill, and low optical
densities.Attempts have been made to remedy the situation in
which ink-jet transparencies are slow to dry or lack capacity
to absorb sufficient volumes of ink, with a goal of
approaching performance obtained with highly absorbent
media. One such attempt is described in a technical paper 
by D. R. Titterington et al, "Development of a Transparent
Receiving Sheet for Ink-Jet Printing", JournalofImagingScience,
Vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 4-8 (Jan/Feb 1986). This
paper describes the use of certain transparent hydrophilic
coatings to permit the use of aqueous-based inks for
printing on transparent media. However, this reference
addresses the problem of slow drying transparencies and
does not disclose ways to improve image quality.While such coatings are useful, considerable work
remains to be done to develop suitable inks and methods of
application that permit substantially uniform high color
density images to be produced on transparent, non-absorbing
media approaching that which can be produced on absorbing
media such as paper.US-A-4 540 996 discloses a method of forming a
multicolour droplet by printing droplets of one colour
in a first pass and superimposing on these droplets
formed of a second colour in a second pass.US-A-4 617 580 discloses a method of forming
multicolour droplets by printing droplets of one colour
in a first pass and partially overlapping these with
droplets of a second colour printed in a second pass.In accordance with the invention, a method is provided
for improving the image quality generated on an
optically transparent receiver sheet that has been coated
with an ink-receptive layer, by the strategic application
of individual ink droplets as applied by an ink-jet

A method of printing at least two dots of ink
sequentially at a particular location to form a spot on

an ink-receptive transparent medium by an ink-jet printer
comprising printing a first dot of ink at said location

during a first scan of a line, delaying a time sufficiently
long to allow the first dot of ink to absorb into

said ink-receptive medium, and printing a second dot of
ink at said location over said first dot of ink during a

second scan of said line, said dot separated from an

number of dots per unit length, wherein the printed dot
diameter ⊘ meets the condition ⊘≤1/D, where D is the

number of dots per unit length.
The method of claim 1, wherein only one dot of ink
is printed on said medium at selected locations during

the first scan of said line, and a second dot of ink, is
printed at said locations during the second scan of said

line.
