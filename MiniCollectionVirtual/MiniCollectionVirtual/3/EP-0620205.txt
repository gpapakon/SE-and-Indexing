<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing acetic acid from ethylene and oxygen by one-stage
catalytic reaction.Acetic acid has heretofore been practically
produced by a process comprising oxidizing acetaldehyde, a
process comprising reacting methanol with carbon monoxide
and a process comprising oxidizing lower paraffin and the
like.The process comprising oxidizing acetaldehyde is
a process of two-stage oxidation, namely, oxidation of
ethylene to form acetaldehyde and oxidation thereof to form
acetic acid. Since the Pd ion contributing to oxidation of
ethylene in this process cannot oxidize acetaldehyde thus
produced, the catalysts used in the two stages differ from
each other. Direct synthesis of acetic acid by this
process is therefore difficult. The process comprising
carbonylation of methanol has a disadvantage that the cost
of Rhodium, the catalyst used in this process, is extremely
high. On the other hand, the process comprising oxidizing
lower hydrocarbon synthesizes acetic acid by one stage.
However, the reaction conditions are comparatively strict,
and as a result many by-products are formed. Accordingly,
the process has problems of improving the reaction
selectivity and the yield. Furthermore, the processes
mentioned above are all carried out by liquid phase
homogeneous reactions, and therefore require complicated
operations to recover catalysts, separate products, and
perform other procedures.Many catalysts have been proposed for processes
of producing acetic acid from ethylene by one-stage
oxidation. For example, there is a disclosure of a process 
wherein Pd metal-phosphoric acid or a sulfur-containing
catalyst modifying agent is used (Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 47-13221 and 51-29425).
Moreover, there is a disclosure of a process in which the
use of a catalyst, a Pd salt of a certain type of
heteropoly-acid, is effective (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 54-57488). It is particularly
industrially important in carrying out reactions using
these catalysts to enhance the activity thereof, reduce the
deterioration of age thereof as much as possible, and use
catalysts exhibiting good selectivity of acetic acid.
However, it is difficult to conclude that those catalysts
which have heretofore been proposed exhibit satisfactory
properties when used in the production of acetic acid on a
industrial scale.Further, there is proposed a gas phase one stage
oxidation process in which a catalyst consisting of a
three-component oxygen compound
