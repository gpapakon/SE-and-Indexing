<DESCRIPTION>
 Peptide Medicaments for Treating DiseaseCross-Referenced to Related Application This application is a continuation-in-part of United States PatentApplication Serial No. 07/917,487 filed 21 July 1992.Field of the InventionThis invention is in the field of biochemistry/molecular biology with emphasis on the identification of peptides that are useful for treating or preventing disease arising from unwanted cell-cell adhesion.Background ArtIt is now well established that cellular interactions are at least in part mediated by receptor/ligand interactions. One class of receptors is known to recognize the peptide sequence "RGD"; other receptors recognize carbohydrate ligands.One class of receptors that recognize carbohydrate-based ligands mediates the adhesion of circulating neutrophils to stimulated vascular endothelium. This is a primary event of the inflammatory response and appears to be involved as well in allergic and autoimmune responses. Several receptors have been implicated in this interaction, including a family of putative lectins that includes gp90MEL (Leu8), ELAM-1 , and GMP-140 (PADGEM) and (Gong, J.-G., et al., Nature (1990) 343:757; Johnston, G.I., et al., Cell (1989) 56:1033; Geoffrey, J.S., and Rosen, S.D., J. Cell Biol.(1989) 109:2463; Lasky, LA., et al., CeH (1989) 56:1045). These lectins have been termed L-SELECTIN, E-SE ECTIN, and P-SELECTIN.E-SELECTIN is perhaps the best characterized of the three selectins. It is particularly interesting because of its transient expression on endothelial cells in response to IL-1 or TNF (Bevilacqua, M.P., et al., Science (1989)243:1160). The time course of this induced expression (2-8 hours) suggests a role for this receptor in initial neutrophil extravasation in response to infection and injury. Furthermore, Bevilacqua et al. (see Bevilacqua, M.P., et 

al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 84.9238) have demonstrated that human neutrophils or HL-60 cells will adhere to COS cells transfected with a plasm id containing a cDNA encoding for the E-SELECTIN receptor. Information regarding the DNA sequences encoding for endothelial cell- leukocyte adhesion molecules are disclosed within PCT published application WO90/13300 published November 15, 1990.Recently, several different groups have published papers regarding the ligand for E-SELECTIN. Lowe et al., (1990) CeH, 63:475-484 reported a positive correlation between the E-SELECTIN dependent adhesion of HL-60 cell variants and transfected cell lines, with their expression of the sialylLewis x (sLex)
