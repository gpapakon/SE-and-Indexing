<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to new 17-position ether
and thioether derivatives of 4-aza-androstan-3-ones and related
compounds, and the use of such compounds as 5α-reductase inhibitors.The art reveals that certain undesirable physiological
manifestations, such as acne vulgaris, seborrhea, female hirsutism, male
pattern baldness and benign prostatic hypertrophy, are the result of
hyperandrogenic stimulation caused by an excessive accumulation of
testosterone or similar androgenic hormones in the metabolic system.
Early attempts to provide a chemotherapeutic agent to counter the
undesirable results of hyperandrogenicity resulted in the discovery of
several steroidal antiandrogens having undesirable hormonal activities
of their own. The estrogens, for example, not only counteract the effect
of the androgens but have a feminizing effect as well. Non-steroidal
antiandrogens have also been developed, for example, 4'-nitro-3'-trifluoromethyl-isobutyranilide.
See Neri, et al., Endo., Vol. 91, No. 2
(1972). However, these products, though devoid of hormonal effects,
are peripherally active, competing with the natural androgens for 
receptor sites, and hence have a tendency to feminize a male host or the
male fetus of a female host.It is now known in the art that the principal mediator of
androgenic activity in some target organs is 5α-dihydrotestosterone,
and that it is formed locally in the target organ by the action of
testosterone-5α-reductase. It is also known that inhibitors of
testosterone-5α-reductase will serve to prevent or lessen symptoms of
hyperandrogenic stimulation.A number of 4-aza steroid compounds are known in the art
as 5α-reductase inhibitors. For example, See U.S. Patent Nos.
