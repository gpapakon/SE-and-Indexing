<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to isolated, 
purified DNA sequences which can act as promoters in 
eukaryotic cells. More specifically, the present 
invention is related to isolated purified DNA sequences 
from maize which act as pollen-specific promoters and 
play a role in the expression of genes in pollen. The 
present invention is also directed to a method for 
conferring on a gene, which is not normally expressed 
in pollen, the ability to be expressed in a pollen-specific 
manner.  
 Male gametogenesis in maize has been well 
characterized biochemically and cytologically, but our 
understanding of the molecular events controlling this 
key process in the angiosperm life cycle is at present 
minimal. The complex differentiation of a maize pollen 
mother cell into the highly specialized trinucleate 
pollen grain suggests that male gametogenesis involves 
the sequential production of many gene products. However, 
only a few genes involved in male gametogenesis in 
flowering plants have been isolated. Evidence for the sequential expression of genes 
in the anther comes from the identification of two 
classes of transcripts expressed during male 
gametogenesis (Mascarenhas 1990); the "early" genes 
are expressed post-meiotically with their levels 
increasing before declining as the pollen grains mature. 
The "late" genes are switched on after microspore mitosis 
and increase to a maximum in mature pollen. It has been 
estimated (Willing etal. 1988) that around 20,000 genes 
are expressed in maize pollen and possibly up to 10% 
are pollen-specific (Stinson etal. 1987). The only 
reported pollen-specific genes cloned from maize are 
Zml3 (Hanson etal. 1989) and Zm58 (Mascarenhas 1990). 
The expression of these genes can first be detected 
following microspore mitosis and they increase to a 
maximum in mature pollen. Zmcl3 shows homology in its 
predicted amino acid sequence to Kunitz trypsin inhibitor  
 
proteins and also to a tomato anther-expressed gene 
LAT52 (Hanson etal. 1989). Zm58 shows homology in 
its predicted amino acid sequence to pectate lyases 
(Mascarenhas 1990). It is suspected that the products 
of genes in this class have a role in pollen germination 
and/or pollen tube growth, whereas products of the 
"early" genes are more likely to be involved in 
microspore development. Sequence comparisons and mutagenesis experiments 
have implicated certain DNA sequence motifs in the 
control of pollen expression of the LAT genes in tomato 
(Twell etal. 1991). Sequence comparisons alone have 
be
