<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus which can output a plurality 
of copies of received information includes a 

reception unit, a printer, and a controller. When a 
plurality of copies of received information are to be 

output, the controller adds information, indicating 
that the plurality of copi
es of received information 
are output, to each copy of recorded information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile
apparatus with a function of outputting a plurality of
copies of received information.Conventionally, a facsimile apparatus which
outputs a plurality of copies of received information
at a receiver station has been proposed. In such a
facsimile apparatus, when a mode for outputting a
plurality of copies of received information is selected
in advance, an apparatus which outputs a plurality of
copies of received information, and outputs respective
addresses on the plurality of copies of output
information as addressees has also been proposed. See
in this context, Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol.16,
No.224 & JP-A-4 040 066 (US-A-5 224 180). See
also DE-A-3 415 839 and WO-A-92/07440.However, in the conventional facsimile apparatus,
since only one addressee is recorded on each of a
plurality of copies of output received documents, a
person who received a copy of a received document can
only recognize the addressee recorded on the document,
and cannot recognize whether this document is sent to
only him or her, or is also sent to other persons. For
this reason, the person may consider, depending on the
contents of information, that the document would better
be distributed to other departments. In this case, the 
person must confirm whether or not the document is
distributed to other addressees by some method,
resulting in an extreme inconvenience in practice.Also, conventionally, a facsimile apparatus which
can output a plurality of copies of received
information by setting the number of copies to be
output in advance has been proposed.In such a facsimile apparatus, when a mode of
outputting a plurality of copies of received
information is selected, the plurality of copies of
received information are output even in a communication
on which a communication error occurred.Even when information is re-sent from an error
page, the apparatus also outputs a plurality of copies
of received information.However, received information whose communication
has a communication error does not include a complete
set of information, i.e., includes incomplete
information. When a plurality of copies of incomplete
received information are output, this often results in
waste of recording sheets.See FR-A-2 641 429 and Patent Abstracts of
Japan, Vol. 13, No. 518 & JP-A-1 209 872 for
other error handling procedures in fascimile
apparatus.Since a plurality of copies of information which
is re-sent from an error page in the communication on
which a communication error occurred are also

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus which can output a plurality of
copies of image data received in one communication, said

facsimile apparatus comprising:

reception means (102) for receiving image data;
image data memory means (114) for storing received image
data;
recording means (134) for recording the received image
data;
instruction means (148) for outputting an instruction
regarding a plurality-of-copies mode for the image data

received in one communication; and
control means (150) for controlling said recording means
(134) in accordance with the output of said instruction means

(148);
characterized in that
when said instruction means (148) does not instruct the
plurality-of-copies mode, said control means (150) causes

said recording means (134) to record the received image data,
and
when said instruction means (148) instructs the
plurality-of-copies mode, said control means (150) causes the

received image data to be stored into said image data memory
means (114), and causes said recording means (134) to record

the stored image data so as to output a plurality of copies
only if the received image data of a communication comprises

no pages containing a transmission error.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein a plural-copies
output operation is performed in the plurality-of-copies

mode, and wherein in response to an occurrence of an error,
said control means (150) cancels the plural-copies output

operation and executes a predetermined operation before 
information stored in said image data memory means (114) is

erased.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said control
means (150) cancels the plural-copies output operation in a

case wherein re-transmission from a sender station is not
performed within a predetermined period of time after

termination due to a communication error.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the
predetermined operation comprises an operation for outputting

none of facsimile information received in an error
communication, and outputting only a communication result

report.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the
predetermined operation comprises an operation for outputting

only a first page of facsimile information received in an
error communication, and a communication result report.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the
predetermined operation comprises an operation for outputting

only a copy of facsimile information received in an error
communication.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 6,
wherein, when no signal is received indicating that the

sender station has a function of re-sending information from
an error page, and when the plurality-of-copies mode is

selected and an error occurs during a communication, said
control means (150) executes the predetermined operation, and

thereafter, the received information stored in said image
data memory means (114) is erased.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 6,
wherein, when the plurality-of-copies mode is selected, in

response to on occurrence of an error during a communication,
said control means (150) cancels the plural-copies output

operation, and executes recording of a message indicating 
that the plural-copies output operation has been tried but

cannot be achieved.
An apparatus according to claim 8, wherein said control
means (150) causes said recording means (134) to record the

message indicating that the plural-copies output operation
has been tried but cannot be achieved recorded on one of a

communication result report and a first page of error
information.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 4 to 6,
further comprising manual selection means (142, 144) for

selecting an operation to be executed when the plural-copies
output operation is cancelled according to a selection of a

user of said apparatus.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control
means (150) combine information received in an error

communication and information re-sent from an error-page.
