<ABSTRACT>
A line driver stage, especially for ECL output levels, contains two bipolar transistors (6, 7) which are connected in series with their collector-emitter paths and are connected between reference potential (VCC) and a supply potential (V2). The arms of a differential amplifier are connected to the reference potential (VCC) and the junction between the bipolar transistors (6, 7) used as output (8). In this arrangement, one load resistor (4, 5) is in each case connected between the collector-base paths of the bipolar transistors (6 and, respectively, 7). Due to the balanced position of the output (8) with respect to the reference potential (VCC) and the supply potential (V2), little current flows through the bipolar transistor (6, 7), especially with an H output level. This results in low power dissipation.
