<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for widing up the 
line around the circumference of life-buoys. It is well known that the life-buoys provided along the 
broadsides of ships or other floating means must have, 
according to international rules, a line of a predetemined 
length, one end thereof being fixed to the life-buoy and the 
other one to be linked to the ship, so as to allow to 
recuperate the life-buoy and the eventual shipwrecked person 
to whom said life-buoy has been thrown. Usually, said line is collected in a hank which sometimes is 
difficult to unravel, as it might also be hardened by an 
eventual coat of paint, whereby the original intention of 
the law is no longer observed. Another possibility is known from US-A-4 416 640, where the line is collected 
on a groove of a toroidal life-buoy. It is the aim of the present invention to completely solve 
above mentioned inconveniences in an easy and functional 
manner. The aim set forth is reached, according to the present 
invention, by means of the features of claim 1.  
 The main advantage of the device according to the present 
invention consists in the reduction of the encumbrance of 
the wound line, as well as the convenience of its 
functioning. The device according to the present invention will be 
described more in detail hereinbelow, relating to the 
enclosed drawings in which some preferred embodiments are 
shown. 
Figure 1,shows a front and partially transparency view of a 
device for winding the line around the 
circumference of a life-buoy. Figure 2,shows a vertical section of a variant according to 
figure 1. Figure 3,shows a vertical section of a variant of the 
device according to the present invention, 
comprising a means for winding up the line applied 
externally to the structure of the life-buoy SV. The enclosed figures show a device for winding up a line S 
around the circumference of a life-buoy SV, mainly 
consisting of an anular groove 1 provided in the thickness 
of said life-buoy SV and in a decentralized position, so as 
to avoid any interference with the supports 3 of the 
perimetral line sections 4 that receive said line S in a 
plurality of overlaying windings. It is obvious that the hollow volume of said anular groove 1 
determines a loss of hydrostatic push which, even if very 
small, will be balanced - according to the present invention 
- by a small increase of the dimensions of the whole tore. The variant of above described device requests therefore a 
new kind of realization of life-buoys; but the

<CLAIMS>
A toroidal life-buoy with a device for winding a rope around its circumference, 
in which said rope is wound avoiding 

any interference with supports on the perimetral 
sections, and in which the different windings hold 

without the need of any additional support of any kind, 
characterized in: 


an annular groove (1) defined in the body of said 
toroidal life-buoy (SV) on an arc extending between 

the external and the central circumference of said 
body of the life-buoy, half-way, for receiving the rope 

(S) in a plurality of overlaying windings; 
a plurality of supports (3) provided around the body 
of the life-buoy so as to avoid interferences with the 

annular groove (1) of said body; 
a perimetral rope (4) for the connection of said 
supports. 
A toroidal life-buoy according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
body of the life-buoy has an increased volume for 

balancing a loss of hydrostatic push due to the volume 
of the annular groove (1). 
A toroidal life-buoy according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
annular groove is continuous.
