<ABSTRACT>
In biological assays in which hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent, or wherein hydrogen peroxide is used to oxidize a dye or other intermediate to generate a detectable species, the stability of the hydrogen peroxide in the presence of catalase and other enzyme which decomposes hydrogen peroxide is enhanced by the addition of a suitable inhibitor for the enzyme. When catalase is the enzyme to be inhibited, catalase inhibitors that can be used in such biological assay systems include hydroxylamine salts such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride and hydroxylamine sulfate, and sodium azide. The enzyme inhibitor can be incorporated in an integral analytic device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an improvement in the 
assay art. It relates to methods and compositions for inhibiting 
catalase activity in biological fluids, and more specifically to 
inhibiting catalase activity in biological fluids during 
qualitative or quantitative analysis of biological fluids, when 
hydrogen peroxide participates in a signal-generating reaction. Human serum contains many enzymes such as catalase, 
glutathione reductase and peroxidase, which readily decompose 
hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, the most important of 
these enzymes being serum catalase [EC 1.11.1.6]. The amount of 
catalase that is present in the plasma of normal human subjects 
can degrade hydrogen peroxide at a rate of 0.01 to 0.05 
moles/liter/minute (Yamagata et al., TohokuJ. Exp. Med. 57:85-92, 
1952; Yamagata et al., TohokuJ. Exp. Med. 57: 101- 107, 
1953; Goth et al., Clin. Chem. 29: 741-743, 1983). Catalase is 
also present in erythrocytes in levels 3600 fold higher than in 
plasma, giving erythrocytes the capacity to degrade gram 
quantities of hydrogen peroxide over several minutes, Gaetani et 
al., Blood73: 334-339 (1989). In fact, catalase has been used 
to verify the specificity of assays of hydrogen peroxide in 
plasma or blood, and the degradation of hydrogen peroxide or 
inhibition of the assay system by the sample should be checked, 
as catalase present in blood or plasma can reduce the value of 
measured hydrogen peroxide to zero, Nahum et al., FreeRadical 
Biology&Medicine6: 470-484, 1989. The ability to measure a wide variety of physiologically 
active compounds, both naturally occurring and synthetic, has 
become of increasing importance, both as an adjunct to diagnosis 
and as therapy. While for the most part assays of physiological 
fluids and drugs have required clinical laboratory 
determinations, there is an increasing awareness of the 
importance of being able to conduct assays in a physician's 
office and/or in the home. To be able to perform an assay  
 
outside of a clinical laboratory setting requires that an assay 
have a simple protocol and be relatively free of sensitivity to 
small changes in the conditions under which the assay is 
conducted. Although a number of systems have been developed to 
try to address the problems associated with analysis outside of 
a clinical laboratory, there is nevertheless a continuing 
interest in providing improved and alternative methods to those 
which are presently generally available. If a clinical detection reaction requires the
