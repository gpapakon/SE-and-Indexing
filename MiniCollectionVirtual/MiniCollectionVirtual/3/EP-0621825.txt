<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS FILLED PANEL INSULATIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to thermal insulating panels useful for placement in building walls, refrigerators and the like, and particularly to a panel utilizing a core/ envelope structure for minimizing radiative, convective and conductive heat transfer across the panel. This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DE-AC03-76SF00098 between the U.S. Department of Energy and the University of California for the operation of Lawrence Berkeley laboratory. The Government has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Means by which walls and the like may be insulated are much discussed in the literature, and various ways of minimizing conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer are described. Fundamentally, all approaches use certain basic understandings of heat transfer. These understandings are applied to select and combine materials in a way which provides the highest possible insulating value under a given set of conditions. There is always a trade-off, however, with respect to the cost of the materials used, and the effort necessary to manufacture such materials into a truly effective insulator from both an insulating and cost of manufacture standpoint.As the cost of energy increases, even relatively small quantitative improvements in the total performance of a particular insulating scheme can provide significant 

 savings for the energy consumer. Given the same insulating value, the relative value of an improved insulating scheme must take into account the thickness of the material, the cost of the materials used, the cost to assemble those materials in the proper form, the cost of transporting such insulation to the place of installation, and the cost to install. Generally, insulations with good thermal performance per unit thickness are more desirable. Bulky and or heavy insulation schemes are disadvantageous, even if good insulating value is provided. Also disadvantageous are materials which have negative environmental impacts, such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) blown foams, and potential health hazards, such as airborne fiberglass. Other characteristics are desirable for certain applications. Daylighting schemes employ natural light transmitted through a building envelope. For these applications it is useful to have an insulator that is partially transparent to the visible spectrum but at the same time providing good resistance to heat flow.Retrofit applications typically have limited space available
