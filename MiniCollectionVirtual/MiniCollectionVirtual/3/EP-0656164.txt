<ABSTRACT>
In TV receiving apparatus, a first IF amplifier chain comprises a first gain-controlled amplifier followed in cascade connection by a second gain-controlled amplifier, and a second IF amplifier chain comprises a third gain-controlled amplifier followed in cascade connection by a fourth gain-controlled amplifier. The second and fourth gain-controlled amplifiers are controlled similarly by an AGC signal, and the first and third gain-controlled amplifiers are controlled similarly by that AGC signal delayed in similar amounts. An RF amplifier is gain-controlled responsive to that AGC signal delayed even more, and a downconverter supplies first detector response to amplified RF, which first detector response is applied to the first and second IF amplifier chains by respective frequency-selective filters. The first IF amplifier response is downconverted to generate sound IF. The second IF amplifier response is detected to recover video signal. An AGC detector detects the peaks of the synchronizing pulses included in the video signal to develope the AGC signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television signal
receiver according to the preamble of independent claim
1 and to the subject matter of independent claim 9.The recent practice in regard to implementing the IF
filtering and gain functions in television signal receiving
apparatus is to use a lumped or "block" filter preceding a
gain-block amplifier comprising plural stages arranged in
direct-coupled cascade within the confines of a monolithic
integrated circuit (IC). No interstage tuning is used.
The amplified IF signal from the gain-block IC amplifier is
further detected substantially within the confines of the
monolithic integrated circuit, to emerge from the IC as
baseband composite video signal and as sound IF at 4.5 MHz.
The amplified IF signal is filtered from these signals to
reduce the likelihood of regeneration causing the gain-block
amplifier to oscillate. The "block" filter is commonly a surface-acoustic-wave
(SAW) filter used to provide the entire passband shape and
adjacent channel attenuation required by a television
receiver. Additional information on SAW filters and on
block filtering and amplification may be found, for
example, in Chapter 13 of the book TELEVISION ENGINEERING
HANDBOOK; K. Blair Benson, Editor in Chief; McGraw-Hill
Book Company, New York; 1986.There are conflicting requirements on video IF
amplification inasfar as best picture reception and best
sound reception are concerned, which conflicting
requirements are more difficult to resolve when a block
filter preceding a gain-block amplifier is used to provide
IF amplification. Good picture reception, with full
resolution capability in the direction of horizontal sweep,
requires that the IF signal as supplied to the video
detector does not include response to in-channel sound
carrier, Accordingly, in television signal receiving
apparatus using discrete amplifying devices with interstage
tuning, an in-channel sound trap commonly precedes the
video detector. Good picture reception further requires
that the IF signal as supplied to the video detector does
not include response to adjacent-channel sound carrier,
which response intrudes "sound beats" into the picture. In
television signal receiving apparatus using discrete
amplifying devices with interstage tuning, an adjacent-channel
sound trap precedes the video detector and provided
high (40 dB or so) rejection over the band in which the
adjacent-channel sound signal as translated to IF appeared.
To obtain such rejection and still maintain acceptably
linear phase response for
