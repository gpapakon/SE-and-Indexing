<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a powder coating 
composition having powder particles wherein at least 

50% of the particles are of a size between 3 and 5 
microns and 100% of the particles are of a size ≦ 10 

microns. The process includes the steps of preparing a 
powder coating extrudate, reducing the extrudate to 

flake, jet milling the powder coating to a powder 
wherein at least 50% of the particles are a particle 

size of between 3 and 5 microns and 100% of the 
particles are of a size less than or equal to 10 

microns, and adding the powder to a mixture of water 
and surfactant. Dispersant and rheology control agents 

are then added to the mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder slurry coating
compositions, and particularly to such compositions
used for automotive coating compositions.Powder slurry coatings provide the most desirable
appearance with respect to smoothness of surface and
gloss when prepared with powder coatings having the
smallest average particle size attainable. Generally,
in coatings known in the art, the average particle
sizes range from 4 to 30 µm. While the art
teaches that resin particles used for powder slurry
coatings range in average particle size between 0.5 µm
and 80 µm, it would be expected in the art
that only 2 to 6 % of the particles have a particle
size of between 3 and 5 µm and 3 to 8 % of the
particles have a particle size of 10 µm. It is
desirable that 100% of the particles are of a size less
than or equal to 10 µm and at least 50 % of the
particles have a particle size of between 3 and 5 µm.It is well known in the art (e.g. from WO-A-8 000 447) to prepare a powder
slurry by dispersing the pulverized powder coating into
a mixture of water and surfactant. In some instances
water soluble binder resins are used to disperse the
powder. The mixture is then run through a mill to
reduce the particles size of the coating. To this
mixture water and dispersants are added. Generally, in
the prior art, powder coatings produced according to
this method have a particle size ranging between 5 and
105 microns at the start of the process. The larger
particles are reduced by using a ball mill, sand mill, 
or Attritor (trademark of Attritor Company for a piece
of grinding equipment providing fast, fine grinding),
to reduce the particle size of the coating to achieve
the best smoothness. It is difficult to achieve
average particle sizes smaller than 18 microns with
conventional grinding equipment including hammer and
ACM mills, as these build up significant amounts of
heat and require liquid nitrogen or other means to
control heat build up.Jet milling is known in the art for the production
of toners and other very fine particle ink products.
Generally jet milling is not utilized in the powder
coating industry, as particles smaller than 20 microns
tend to agglomerate in powder coatings. Fine powders
are difficult to spray as they agglomerate into larger
particles. Further, the resulting finish is very rough
due to this agglomeration. When combining fine powders
with water to make a powder slurry the powder is
difficult to wet out in water and the resulting mixture
tends to have powder floating on the surface with very
little of the
