<ABSTRACT>
A combination machine (3) for developing and printing 
photographic material continously and automatically, 

composed of modules (4, 5, 6, 7) allowing easy mutual 
assembly and separation. The basic structure of such a 

machine comprises a module (4) for printing from film 
onto paper, surmounting a print developing module (5), 

this in turn positioned alongside a module (6) housing 
devices by which prints emerging from the developing 

module (5) are dried, as well as containers holding the 
liquids used to regenerate and replenish the various 

chemical treatment baths. An additional module (7) for 
developing film can be positioned on top of the drier 

module (6), whilst the print module (4) is also hinged 
at the bottom along one side to the outer edge of the 

module (5) beneath in such a way as to tilt clear and 
allow easy access to the inside of the machine (3) for 

the purposes of cleaning and servicing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination machine
for developing and printing photographic material.The prior art embraces automatic machines capable of
developing exposed photographic films and printing the
images from developed films onto light-sensitive paper,
all of which continuously.Machines of the type in question find use principally
in photographic laboratories where large quantities of
photographic material are developed and printed; such
machines require skilled and properly trained staff,
and their typically substantial dimensions dictate a
need for considerable amounts of space.There has been a trend over recent years for general
photographic developing and printing services to be
offered even by commercial enterprises with no claim to
specialization in this particular field, for example
stationers, department stores, etc., which endeavour to
offer a comprehensive service though often with limited
space at their disposal and without especially skilled
staff. To combat such a situation, multifunctional automatic
machines have been designed in which the developing and
printing stages are incorporated into a single unit.EP-A-136 979 discloses a multifunctional machine in which
the film processing section, the paper printing section and the
paper processing section are placed within separate units.However, these machines tend still either to be bulky
and therefore unsuitable for installation in the spaces
typically available, or lacking in flexibility of use,
able to produce only the more familiar commercial sizes
of print and prevented by limited space from handling
larger items such as 30x45 cm, so that for this type of
business, which if retained would be a great advantage
to the user given the notable added value attached,
films must be sent to the specialized laboratories.Further negative aspects of these machines are to be
found in their monolithic structure. In effect, the
typical casing almost invariably presents an obstacle
to the replacement of those units or devices such as
the film developing unit, the printing unit, and the
print developing unit, when found to fall short of the
performance required or in the event of changes to the
processing method. More exactly, units designed and
built to perform single specific functions will be of
characteristic shapes and dimensions that turn out in
practice to be incompatible with those of other units,
and must be separated one from another, with the result
that space is taken up irrationally; if designed and 
built to be incorporated

<CLAIMS>
A machine (3) for developing and printing photographic
material continuously and automatically, comprising

a unit (7) by which photographic film is developed
and dried, a unit (4) by which the image on a film

is printed onto a sheet of light-sensitive paper, this latter unit
including a device by which the image is

analyzed to ensure its accurate reproduction, a unit (5)
for developing the light-sensitive paper, and a unit (6)

for drying the light-sensitive paper,

characterized in that the units (4,5,6,7) are accomodated
within respective modular casings assembled in

removable association one with another by way of
mechanical and electrical connections;

in that the modular casing of the unit (4) by which images
are printed on light-sensitive paper is mounted above

and in association with the modular
casing of the unit (5) by which the light-sensitive paper

is developed; in that the modular casing of the unit
(6) for drying the light-sensitive paper is adjacent to

the modular casing of the unit (5) for developing the
light-sensitive paper; and in that the modular casing of

the unit (7) for developing and drying photographic film
is mounted above the modular casing of

the unit (6) for drying the light-sensitive paper and 
also accomodates reserve supplies of regenerating

and replenishing liquids.
A machine as in claim 1, characterized in
that the modular casing of the unit (4),by which images

are printed on light-sensitive paper,is tiltable by rotation
about a horizontal axis (x-x) extending along

the adjacent side wall of the machine (3) in such a way
as to rotate clockwise, as viewed by the operator, for

affording access to internal parts of the machine (3)
and for facilitating the periodical servicing and inspecting

operations.
