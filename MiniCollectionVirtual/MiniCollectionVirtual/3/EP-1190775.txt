<DESCRIPTION>
The present proposals have to do with hand-operated
dispenser pumps, and particularly in certain aspects to such
pumps adapted for the dispensing of foam from a supply of
foamable liquid in a container to which the dispenser is
fitted.Over the last 15 years or so the use of foam dispensers
based on aerosols using pressurized gas has declined steeply
for environmental reasons, leading to the development of
foaming dispensers which exploit a manual pumping action to
blend air and liquid and create foam.A particular category of such known dispensers to which
certain of the present proposals relate (referred to in what
follows as foaming dispensers "of the kind described")
provides both a liquid pump and an air pump mounted at the
top of a container for the foamable liquid. The liquid pump
has a liquid pump chamber defined between a liquid cylinder
and a liquid piston, and the air pump has an air pump
chamber defined between an air cylinder and an air piston.
Preferably these components are arranged concentrically
around a plunger axis of the pump. The liquid piston and
air piston are reciprocable together in their respective
cylinders by the action of a pump plunger: typically the two
pistons are integrated with the plunger. An air inlet valve
and a liquid inlet valve are provided for the air chamber
and liquid chamber. An air discharge passage and a liquid
discharge passage lead from the respective chambers to an
outlet passage by way of a permeable foam-generating
element, preferably one or more mesh layers, through which 
the air and liquid pass as a mixture. Preferably the air
discharge passage and liquid discharge passage meet in a
mixing chamber or mixing region immediately upstream of the
permeable foam-generating element.It is not easy to achieve a good quality foam consistently
from dispensers of the kind described. There are also
difficulties in providing for adequate venting and valving
of the different fluid spaces and paths while assuring a
positive operation without leaks.EP-A-565713 describes admitting air to the air cylinder
through a ball valve in the top wall of the air piston.
This does not work when wet, nor when the plunger is pressed
slowly, and there is a problem of liquid entering the air
chamber via the mixing chamber and air discharge passage.EP-A-613728 refines the air valving using a single
elastomeric annulus in the air piston roof whose outer rim
acts as an air inlet flap valve and whose inner rim acts as
an air discharge flap valve against the plunger stem. This
arrangement
