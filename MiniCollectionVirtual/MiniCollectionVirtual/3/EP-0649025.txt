<ABSTRACT>
The housing of the electricity meter contains a data memory and an externally accessible interface with the latter and is closed off by a housing cover (3) secured by a lead seal (11). The data memory is subdivided into memory regions with different degrees of security. For the memory regions with a higher degree of security, access is possible only after breaking a calibration lead seal and carrying out an additional manipulation. The additional manipulation consists in closing a calibration contact arranged in the interior of the meter, and the calibration lead seal is formed by the lead seal (11) for securing the housing cover (3).
