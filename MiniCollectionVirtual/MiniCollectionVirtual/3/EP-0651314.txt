<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for managing operations of a processing 
device are provided, the apparatus comprising: calculation means for 

computing a cumulative thermal load caused by instructions to be executed 
by said processing device; comparison means for determining whether said 

cumulative thermal load exceeds a thermal range of said processing 
device; and control means, coupled to said comparison means, for reducing 

the cumulative thermal load of said processing device if the comparison 
means determines that said cumulative thermal load exceeds the thermal 

range of the processing device, such reduction occurring prior to 
execution of the instructions which would have caused the thermal range 

to be exceeded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to processing devices such as 
electronic circuits and more particularly to a thermal protection unit 
for such processing devices. The problem of circuits overheating is well known in the art. 
Typically, the circuits are tested to determine the maximum thermal 
conditions that the circuits can withstand and then appropriate cooling 
is provided, such as a fan, to prevent such a condition from occurring. Computer circuitry is particularly susceptible to overheating and 
the computer may be occasionally used in conditions outside specified 
normal ranges. For example, ambient temperatures may exceed the 
specifications for the computer such as when air conditioning is 
temporarily out of order or collected dust and other contaminants may 
prevent the cooling fans from working properly. As a result, some form 
of heat detection such as a thermistor may be coupled to a fan to prevent 
the computer circuits from overheating by increasing the fan speed when 
the thermistor detects that the computer may be overheating. However, 
thermistors and many other types of analog sensors are subject to 
inaccuracies from unit variation and from degradation over time. As a 
result, some overheating conditions may not be detected by a thermistor. It is hence an object of the present invention to provide such 
processing devices with improved protection against overheating. Accordingly the present invention provides an apparatus for 
managing operations of a processing device, comprising: calculation means 
for computing a cumulative thermal load caused by instructions to be 
executed by said processing device; comparison means for determining 
whether said cumulative thermal load exceeds a thermal range of said 
processing device; and control means, coupled to said comparison means, 
for reducing the cumulative thermal load of said processing device if the 
comparison means determines that said cumulative thermal load exceeds the 
thermal range of the processing device, such reduction occurring prior to 
execution of the instructions which would have caused the thermal range 
to be exceeded.  Viewed from a second aspect the present invention provides a method 
for managing operations of a processing device, comprising the steps of: 
(a) computing a cumulative thermal load caused by instructions to be 
executed by said processing device; (b) determining whether said cumulative thermal load exceeds a thermal 
range of said processing device; and (c) reducing, subsequent to step (b), the
