<ABSTRACT>
A chain organopolysiloxane is obtained by polymerizing a 
fluorine-containing cyclotrisiloxane of the general formula: 


   (wherein R¹ is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, and Rf 
is a perfluoroalkyl group or perfluoroalkyl ether 

group)
 

in the presence of a lithium silanolate catalyst, silylating 
the resulting polymerization product, and treating the 

silylated product at a temperature of not lower than 100°C 
under a reduced pressure of not higher than 10⁻¹ mmHg to 

remove volatile components therefrom. The organopolysiloxane 
is essentially free of volatile low-molecular 

siloxanes. Therefore, the chain organopolysiloxane can be 
used without the problems which might arise from the 

volatile low-molecular siloxanes, such as evaporation of 
low-molecular siloxanes from a cured rubber product with 

the result of electrical-contact troubles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new fluorine-containing
linear organopolysiloxane which does
not contain volatile low-molecular siloxanes and has excellent
heat resistance, and to a process for producing
the same.Organopolysiloxanes are used in a wide range of
industrial fields, because of their low surface tension
and low refractive index as well as good heat resistance,
cold resistance, electrical insulation properties, water
repellency, mold release properties, defoaming properties,
chemical resistance and so forth. In order to meet the
increasingly higher requirements accompanying the recent
technological advances, however, there is a request for
development of an organopolysiloxane excellent in various
properties.As a material for fulfilling some of the requirements,
for example, organopolysiloxanes having a fluorine-containing
organic group in their molecule are known.
(Fluoro-organopolysiloxanes are described, for example, in
US-A-4 988 758, US-A-5 087 683, EP-A-0 384 730, DE-A-2 834 172
and DE-A-3 841 589.)
However, the fluorine-containing organic groups in these
organopolysiloxanes are mostly 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, and,
as organopolysiloxanes having a longer-chain fluorine-containing 
organic group, there are only known those
organopolysiloxanes which have in their molecule a
fluorine-containing organic group of the following formula:
F(CaF2aO)b CcF2c-CH2O-R-
wherein a is an integer of 1 to 3, b is an integer of 1 to
5, c is an integer of 1 or 2, and R is a divalent
fluorine-free organic group of 3 to 10 carbon atoms (Refer
to Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication (KOKAI)
Nos. 2-219829 (1990) and 2-219830 (1990)). The long-chain
fluorine-containing organic groups of the above formula
have the disadvantage that the -CH2-O-R- linkage portion
is unstable at high temperatures, thereby limiting the
thermal resistance of the organopolysiloxane.An organopolysiloxane having a long-chain
fluorine-containing organic group such as fluoroalkyl
group or fluoropolyether group may be produced by a method
in which a cyclotrisiloxane having the relevant fluorine-containing
organic group is prepared and the
cyclotrisiloxane, either alone or together with a
fluorine-free cyclotrisiloxane such as hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane,
is subjected to polymerization
in the presence of a catalyst such as concentrated
sulfuric acid, activated clay, acid-treated activated
clay, alkali metal hydroxides or silanolates, quaternary
ammonium hydroxides or quaternary phosphonium hydroxides.
According to this method, however,
