<ABSTRACT>
An infrared radiation detector has a cooled detector element (3) arranged inside an inner cold insulator (1i), as well as an outer cold insulator (1a) mounted upstream of the inner cold insulator (1i) and thermally separated therefrom. The outer cold insulator (1a) forms the aperture diaphragm and the output aperture plate of the infrared optic (IR optic) which reproduces an infrared image on the surface of the detector element (3). The conditions of the disclosed detector are selected so that in identical optical conditions the distance between the inner cold insulator and the detector element may be substantially reduced in comparison with the state-of-the-art (for example down to 2/3 or less of the distance required in the state-of-the-art).
