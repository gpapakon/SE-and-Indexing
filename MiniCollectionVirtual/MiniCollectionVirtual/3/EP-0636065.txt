<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSOFT STRETCHABLE COMPOSITE FABRICFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention is related to stretchable layered composite fabrics, more particularly, to layered composite fabrics which provide barrier properties with water vapor permeability.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONKnitted fabrics are generally softer, more drapeable, offer less resistance to stretching and can be stretched without damage further than woven fabrics. These comfort related properties are very important considerations in the design and manufacture of many types of lightweight or close-fitting garments.Lightweight knitted fabrics have a relatively open construction, exhibit high air permeability and, consequently, have virtually no barrier properties such as windproofness or thermal insulation qualities. This severely limits the outdoor applications in colder weather without additional outer layers.It is very desirable to enhance the barrier properties of the lightweight knitted fabrics while continuing to provide comfort related properties such as softness, drapeability, stretchability, stretch-recovery and water-vapor-permeability.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention provides soft drapeable stretchable water- vapor-permeable layered composite materials having low tensile modulus in the transverse direction and having functional properties such as windproofness, water-vapor-permeability, weather resistance or waterproofness.By "tensile modulus" it is meant the resistance of a material to be stretched or elongated. It is expressed herein in terms of 

the force (F) required to stretch or elongate the material a specified distance (D) .By "windproofness" it is meant a low rate of permeability of air through the material. It is expressed herein in terms of the volume of air (cm^) passing through a given area (cm2) in a given time (min) under a given pressure drop (mm water pressure).The force to displacement (F/D) ratio as used herein is the ratio obtained by dividing the tensile force (expressed in Newtons) to stretch a 2.54 cm wide specimen to 1.25 times its original length (25% extension) by the displacement (expressed in centimeters) to reach 25% extension.Transverse direction is used herein to indicate the direction in the plane of manufacture perpendicular to the machine direction (direction of manufacture). The materials of the layers described herein are considered to be planar, defined by their length (machine direction) and width (transverse direction).The composite material of the invention can comprise a layer
