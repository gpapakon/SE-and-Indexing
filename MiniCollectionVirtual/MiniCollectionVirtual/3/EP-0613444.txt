<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine engine (10) is suspended via a casing (15) from a pylon (12) by a fron mount (20) and a rear mount (40). The front mount (20) comprises a bracket (22), having a plurality of pins (26, 28 and 30) integral therewith, which is bolted to the underside (11) of the pylon (12). The first pin (26) engages an annular flange (16) around the casing (15) to support the engine (10) in a vertical plane. The second pin (28) engages with the casing (15) directly to prevent axial and lateral movement of the engine (10) relative to the pylon (12). The third pin (30) is provided as a failsafe. In normal operation the third pin (30) carries no load, however if the first pin (26) should break the third pin (30) then supports the engine (10) in a vertical plane. The front mount (20) is split in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the engine (10) to render the mount (20) damage tolerant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mounting arrangement 
by which a gas turbine engine is attached to an aircraft. In 
particular it relates to a mounting arrangement suitable for 
connecting a gas turbine engine to a pylon of an aircraft 
wing. According to the present invention a combination of a 
gas turbine engine having a casing provided with a first and 
second annular flange and a mounting arrangement comprises a 
support member for attachment to an aircraft structure from 
which the engine is to be mounted, the support member having 
a first connection means which engages the first annular 
flange on the engine casing to support the engine in a 
vertical plane, the vertical loads acting peripherally of 
the engine casing through the first annular flange, second 
connection means which engages the engine casing directly to 
prevent axial movement of the engine relative to the 
aircraft structure and a third connection means which in 
normal operation carries no load unless the first connection 
means fails whereby the third connection means engages with 
a second annular flange on the engine casing to support the 
engine in a vertical plane, the vertical loads acting 
peripherally of the engine casing through the second annular 
flange, characterised in that the support member along with 
its first, second and third connection means are split 
vertically in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the engine to render them damage tolerant and the halves 
of the connection menas are an integral part of the 
respective half of the support member. Preferably the connection means are pins. The first pin 
may be located in a number of links attached to the first 
annular flange which disperse the load to a number of points 
on the first annular flange. The connection means are preferably coated with a wear 
resistance coating, such as tungsten carbide cobalt, which 
reduces the amount of wear. The mounting arrangement is for use on a gas turbine  
 
engine which is also provided with a connection means which 
prevents rotation of the engine relative to the aircraft 
structure from which the engine is mounted. The aircraft 
structure from which the engine is mounted is preferably a 
pylon attached to the main beam of an aircraft wing. The present invention will now be described with 
reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of a gas turbine engine 
having a mounting arrangement in accordance with the present 
invention. Figure 2 is an enlarged pictorial

A combination of a gas turbine engine (10) having a 
casing (15) provided with first and second annular flanges 

(16,18) and a mounting arrangement comprising a support 
member (22) for attachment to an aircraft structure (12) 

from which the engine (10) is to be mounted, the support 
member (22) having a first connection means (26) which 

engages the first annular flange (16) on the engine casing 
(15) to support the engine (10) in a vertical plane, the 

vertical loads acting peripherally of the engine casing (15) 
through the first annular flange (16), a second connection 

means (28) which engages the engine casing (15) directly to 
prevent axial movement of the engine (10) relative to the 

aircraft structure (12) and a third connection means (30) 
which in normal operation carries no load unless the first 

connection means (26) breaks whereby the third connection 
means (30) engages with the second annular flange (18) on 

the engine casing (15) to support the engine (10) in a 
vertical plane, the vertical loads acting peripherally of 

the engine (15) casing through a second annular flange (18) 
characterised in that the support member (22) along with its 

first (26), second (28) and third (30) connection means are 
split vertically in a direction parallel to the longitudinal 

axis of the engine (10) to render them damage tolerant and 
the halves of the connection means (26,28,30) are an 

integral part of the respective half of the support member 
(22).

arrangement as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the 

connection means (26, 28 and 38) are pins. 
A combination of a gas turbine engine and a mounting 
arrangement as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the 

first connection means (26) engages a number of links (25 
and 27) which are attached to the first annular flange (16) 

on the engine casing (15) and which distribute the vertical 
loads acting thereon to a number of points on the first  

 
annular flange (16).
