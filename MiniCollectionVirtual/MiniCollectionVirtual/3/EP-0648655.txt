<CLAIMS>
Device for expelling small creatures out of motor vehicle engine 
compartments, which comprises at least one movement sensor (3), having 

a means (9) provided in the engine compartment (1) for producing an airflow 
which can be controlled by means of the movement sensor, characterised in 

that the means (9) is an electric fan for a cooling system (8) of the drive 
machine (2) of the motor vehicle which, in the event of the drive machine (2) 

being switched off, can be controlled by means of the movement sensor (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the movement sensor (3) 
is disposed in the region (5) where the small creatures enter the engine 

compartment (1). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 or 2 characterised in that a holding 
arrangement is provided for the purpose of ensuring that the means (9) is 

switched on for a predetermined minimum time to produce an airflow.
