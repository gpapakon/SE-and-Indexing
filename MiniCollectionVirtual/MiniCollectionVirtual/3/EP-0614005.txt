<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling the injectors of a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine having controlled ignition and multipoint injection, according to which the injectors are grouped in pairs, the injectors of each pair are caused to open once per engine cycle, and so that the control sequencing of the two pairs is insensitive to the phasing of the engine, and, using for the injectors the indexing of the cylinders of the engine, injectors 1 and 4, on the one hand, and injectors 2 and 3, on the other hand, are paired, the injection of each of the two pairs of injectors 1-4 and 2-3 is initiated during one, respectively, two successive engine half-revolutions, and these two commands are followed by two successive engine half-revolutions without injector control, and the sequence is then repeated so long as the engine is controlled with synchronous operation.

Injection control process for an internal combustion 
engine with controlled ignition and multipoint injection, 

having four cylinders and functioning according to a four-stroke 
cycle, and which comprises one injector per cylinder, 

the process comprising the stages consisting in grouping the 
injectors in pairs, controlling the opening of the injectors 

of each pair a single time per engine cycle, and in such a 
way that the control sequence of the two pairs is not 

susceptible to the phasing of the engine, characterised in 
that it comprises in addition the stages consisting of 

indexing each injector with the same index as the cylinder 
of the engine which it feeds, pairing up the injectors 1 and 

4 on one side and the injectors 2 and 3 on the other, 
initiating the injection of each of the two pairs of 

injectors 1-4 and 2-3 during the course of one of the two 
successive half turns of the engine, and causing these two 

controls to be followed by two successive half turns of the 
engine without control of the injectors, then starting the 

sequence again whilst the engine is controlled in 
synchronized functioning. 
Injection control process according to claim 1 
characterised in that it comprises in addition the stage 

consisting of determining the sequence of the control of the 
two pairs of injectors (1-4 then 2-3, or 2-3 then 1-4) as a 

function of the state of the engine in relation to its cycle 
at the moment of the start of the synchronizing function of 

the engine, for example following a starting up of the 
engine or on the occasion of a renewed injection after a 

break of the latter. 
Injection control process according to claim 2 
characterised in that it consists in choosing the control  

 
sequence of the pair of injectors 1 - 4 then of the pair 2-3 

or the control sequence of the pair of injectors 2 - 3 then 
the pair 1 - 4 depending on whether the first signal of the 

high dead centre or low dead centre given by a rotation 
sensor of the engine after the entrance of the engine in the 

synchronized functioning phase is a signal of the high dead 
centre or low dead centre for the pair 1 - 4. 
Injection control process according to either of claims 
2 and 3 characterised in that it consists in addition of 

introducing a calculated timing delay between the 
determining of the control sequence of the pairs of 

injectors 1 - 4 and 2 -3, and the effective progression of 
the injection as a function of previous events, such as the 

starting up of the engine or a break in injection, for 
example during deceleration. 
Injection control process according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that it consists in 

initiating the injection during the intake phase of one of 
the two cylinders corresponding to each pair of injectors 1 

- 4 and 2 - 3 and during the power stroke phase of the other 
cylinder. 
Injection control process according to any of claims 1 
to 4 characterised in that it consists in initiating the 

injection during the exhaust stroke phase of one of the two 
cylinders corresponding to each pair of injectors 1-4 and 2-3, 

and during the compression phase of the other cylinder. 
Injection control process according to claims 5 and 6 
characterised in that it consists in addition of passing 

from the implementation of the process according to one of 
claims 5 and 6 to the implementation of the process 

according to the other of these claims, as a function of at  
 

least one functioning parameter and/or thermal state of the 
engine or associated equipment.
