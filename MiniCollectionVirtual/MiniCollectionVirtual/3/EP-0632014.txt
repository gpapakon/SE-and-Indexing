<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic photosensitive member 
is constituted by disposing a photosensitive layer on 

a support. The photosensitive layer is characterized 
by containing a specific triphenylamine compound 

having at least two phenyl groups each substituted 
with two alkyl groups including one alkyl group 

located in meta-position in conjunction with nitrogen 
atom or each substituted with three alkyl groups. The 

photosensitive member is suitable for providing an 
electrophotographic apparatus showing excellent 

electrophotographic characteristics such as a high 
photosensitivity, a good potent
ial stability in 
repetitive use, a decreased transfer memory, no crack 

in the photosensitive layer and no crystallization of 
a charge-transporting material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic photosensitive member
(hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "photosensitive
member"), particularly to an electrophotographic
photosensitive member having a photosensitive layer
containing a specific triphenylamine compound.The present invention also relates to an
electrophotographic apparatus using the
electrophotographic photosensitive member.Heretofore, there have been proposed
inorganic photosensitive members containing a
photosensitive layer comprising an inorganic
photoconductive material such as selenium, zinc oxide
or cadmium as a main component. The inorganic
photosensitive members, however, have encountered some
problems such as poor film-forming properties, a low
plasticity and an expensive production cost. The
inorganic photoconductive material generally has a
high toxicity. Accordingly, there have been large
constraints on production of the photosensitive member
and handling of the inorganic photoconductive
material.On the other hand, many organic 
photosensitive members containing organic
photoconductive materials as a main component have
remedied the above drawbacks of the inorganic
photosensitive members and has attracted considerable
attention, thus having been proposed and also having
been put into practical use in some cases. As the
organic photoconductive material for use in the
organic photosensitive member, there have been
proposed a charge transfer complex containing an
organic photoconductive material such as poly-N-vinyl
carbazole and Lewis acid such as 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone.
These organic photoconductive material
have been excellent in light weight properties and
film-forming properties but having been inferior to
the inorganic photoconductive material in respect of a
sensitivity, a durability, a stability against
environmental change, etc.Thereafter, there has been proposed a
photosensitive member having a laminate-type
structure, wherein a photosensitive layer comprises a
charge generation layer (CGL) containing a charge-generating
substance (CGS) such as organic
photoconductive dyes or pigments and a charge
transport layer (CTL) containing a charge-transporting
substance (CTS) (i.e., so-called "function-separation
type photosensitive member"). Such a function-separation
type photosensitive member has brought 
about a considerable improvement on a conventional
photosensitive member having defects such as low
sensitivity and poor durability.The function-separation type photosensitive
member allows a wide latitude in
