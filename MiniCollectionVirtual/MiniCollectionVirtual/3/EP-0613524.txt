<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder block for an internal combustion engine has at least two adjacent cylinders enclosed in a water cooling jacket and supported on the upper part of the crankcase. In order to achieve a high fatigue strength while reducing weight, the outer side of the water cooling jacket (3) has a reinforcement rib (7) with a U-shaped cross section in the parting plane between two cylinders (2). The reinforcement rib (7) extends up to the area of the bearing webs (4) of the crankshaft bearing.

<CLAIMS>
Cylinder block of grey cast iron for an intemal combustion engine having at least two 
cylinders (2) adjacent to one another which are enclosed by a water jacket (3) and which 

are supported on the upper part of the crankcase and where each time in the parting 
plane between the two cylinders (2) the outer side of the water jacket (3) has a re-inforcing 

rib (7) which continues each time to the region of the crankshaft bearing and 
which has a U-shaped cross-section, whereby the inner side of the U-profile at its upper 

end extends each time as an extension of the drilling (8) for the cylinder head bolts and 
at its lower end extends down to the drilling (9) for the fixing bolts of the crankshaft 

bearing at the bearing web (4). 
Cylinder head in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, the re-inforcing ribs 
extend each time on the upper side of the bearing web (4) down to the bottom region (5) 

of the cylinder block. 
Cylinder block in accordance with Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that, in the parting 
plane at the inner side of the casing (6) each time a continuation casing rib (11) is 

provided at the re-inforcing rib (7) of the bottom region (5). 
Cylinder head in accordance with one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that, the 
casing rib (11) has a profile which is U-shaped in cross-section. 
Cylinder head in accordance with one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that, at least 
one of the re-inforcing ribs (7) which are U-shaped in cross-section is designed as a 

closed channel by means of a cover (13) at least in the region of the neighbouring 
cylinders (2) whereby the closed channel is provided with an inlet opening (16) at the 

upper end in the region of the joining plane (15) for the cylinder head and is provided with 
an outlet opening (19) at the lower end, and which forms a retum channel. 
Cylinder head in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that, the oil retum channel 
in the region of the lower half of the cylinder (2) continues as a precast channel in the 

casing (6).
