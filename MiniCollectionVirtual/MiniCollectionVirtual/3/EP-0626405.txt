<ABSTRACT>
Poly- epsilon -caprolactones are manufactured by continuous polymerisation of  epsilon -caprolactone as a melt in an extruder (reactive extrusion) with the use of a polymerisation initiator chosen from aluminium alkoxides. The appropriate adjustment of the feed rates of  epsilon -caprolactone and of aluminium alkoxide to the extruder allows the tailored manufacture of poly- epsilon -caprolactones which have high and preestablished weight-average molecular masses. Poly- epsilon -caprolactones which can be obtained by the process are characterised by weight-average molecular masses (Mw) of at least approximately 95,000 g/mole and Mw/Mn ratios of at least approximately 2.
