<ABSTRACT>
A medical inspection system comprising a medical inspection part (1), a patient 
table (2,16) movable relative to the medical inspection part (1) and a position detector 

(24) for locating the position of the patient table (2,16). According to the present 
invention, the system is controlled by various kinds of control computers (6,11,12,14) so 

that the position of the patient table (2,16) with respect to the medical inspection part (1) 
can be securely located. This system is applied to an X-ray CT system. The present 

invention also provides a method for locating the patient table (2,16) with respect to the 
medical inspection part (1) of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical inspection system such as an X-ray
CT system and to a method for locating the position of a patient table of the
system.In the case of the conventional X-ray CT system, the patient is placed on the roof
panel of a patient table. Where the roof panel of the patient table is positioned, the
relative position between the scanner gantry of the X-ray CT system and the roof panel
of the patient table is made use of. This is because where an X-ray CT diagnosis is
made, it is necessary for the diagnostician to know the distance from the position at
which he desires to start photographing to the affected part of the patient's body. That is,
for photographing an X-ray CT image, a fluoroscopic image (scanogram) is used for
positioning. In this case, when the target is the patient's head, the photographing position
is determined at the same pitch, i.e., 5 mm or 10 mm from the eyeball toward the neck.In this case, the value for each photographing position itself is not significant.
Such a position is a piece of information by which the X-ray CT system manages (i.e., it
is used to decide ranking when the CT system displays images). The above-described
procedures have been taken for the conventional roentgenography and the diagnostic
method based thereon. In the conventional X-ray photography, no positional
information has been incorporated in the photographing procedures and it is the present
state of the art that the distance from a reference portion of the patient's body (i.e., an
internal organ, a bone and etc.) is measured. This fact shows that no coordinate system is
required for X-ray photographing.Further, from the fact that an X-ray photographing system photographs X-ray
CT images a plurality of times at certain intervals of time, the introduction of the concept
of "absolute position" follows as a logical consequence so that it becomes necessary to
set the patient's body at a certain position at all times.This is impractical when we consider that the patient is a human being and his
health condition is always changing with time. Even a healthy person can not reproduce
the same posture and position at an interval of time.For the above reasons, it has conventionally been practiced without exception
that a fluoroscopic image is photographed and after positioning, a CT image is
photographed.Accordingly, in the conventional X-ray CT system, the position of the roof panel
of the patient table is not measured on the basis of the absolute position. Fig. 5 shows the routine
