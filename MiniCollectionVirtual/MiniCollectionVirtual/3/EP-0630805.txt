A floating stretcher designed, in particular, for the 
recovery of injured persons at sea, of the type comprising a 

metallic framework (1) capable of being winched by a 
helicopter, supporting a panel (2) of composite material, 

that ensures the buoyancy of the assembly, characterized in 
that said panel (2) and framework (1) are hingedly connected 

(27, 6) at their median portion so that the assembly can be 
folded back on itself lengthwise. 
The floating stretcher according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the metallic framework (1) comprises 

essentially a rigid main tube (3) bent in the area of the 
injured person's head and two limbs (5) which extend 

substantially parallel to the area of the feet of the person, 
each of the limbs (5) of said tube (3) being provided in its 

median portion with a hinge (6) and a means (9-10) for 
locking said hinge (6) to render the framework (1) rigid in 

an unfolded position. 
The floating stretcher according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the hinge (6) comprises a link (7) 

pivotally mounted to each limb portion (5) by a pin (8), and 
the loacking means comprises a female ring (9) slidably 

mounted of one of the limb portions and threadably engagable 
with a male ring (10) provided on the other limb portion, by 

clasping link (7). 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the panel (2) of composite 

material is made of two rigid portions (25, 26) hinged to one 
another by two hinges (27) disposed laterally, a means (30) 

for locking said hinges (27) being provided to render said 
panel (2) rigid in an unfolded position. 
The floating stretcher according to claim 4, 
characterized in that the hinge (27) comprises a link (28) 

pivotally mounted to each of the panel portions (25, 26) by 
a pin (29), and the locking means comprises a U-channel (30) 

slidably mounted and engagable with contiguous edges of the 
two panel portions (25, 26) on either side of the hinge (27). 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 2 
to 5, characterized in that the panel (2) of composite  

 
material mates with the shape of the main tube (3) of the 

framework (1) and has a perfectly plane upper face, while its 
lower face has a bulging portion (31) in the area of the head 

of the person that extends towards the area of the feet by 
two parallel, longitudinal chevrons (32). 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 2 
to 6, characterized in that the panel (2) of composite 

material is removably fixed to the metallic framework (1) by 
a recess provided on a front portion that engages the bent 

portion (4) of the main tube (3), and by two pins (34) on the 
limb portions that engage in lateral holes (33) provided in 

the panel (2) in the area of the feet. 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 2 
to 7, characterized in that the metallic framework (1) has on 

a lower portion thereof a secondary tube (11) of smaller 
diameter connected to the main tube by junction tubes (12) 

and extending parallel to the main tube along the two limbs 
(5) thereof so as to form two sled runners, the secondary 

tube being interrupted (13) at each of the hinges (6) of the 
main tube (3). 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 2 
to 8, characterized in that it comprises a hoop (15) fixed to 

the framework (1) in the area of the bent portion (4) of the 
main tube (3) and connected to it by junction tubes (16) to 

protect the head of the injured person. 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 2 
to 9, characterized in that it further includes an extendable 

foot-rest (17) mounted slidably in sheaths (18) fixed to the 
framework (1) at the ends of the two limbs (5) of the main 

tube (3), a locking means being provided to lock said foot-rest 
(17) either in its extended position or in its retracted 

position. 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 2 
to 10, characterized in that it further includes extendable 

handles (22, 23) in the area of the feet and of the head of 
the person enabling the stretcher to be transported manually, 

the handles (22) at the head area being slidably mounted in  
 

sheaths (24) fixed to the main tube (3) of the framework (1), 
on either side of the bent portion (4), while the handles at 

the feet area are slidably mounted in the ends of the two 
parallel limbs (5) of said main tube (3). 
The floating stretcher according to any of claims 1 
to 11, characterized in that the panel (2) of composite 

material has straps (35) for securing the injured person, and 
carrying handles (36).
