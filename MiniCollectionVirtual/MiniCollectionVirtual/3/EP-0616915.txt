Device for covering and uncovering a vehicle, 
more especially a haulage or semi-trailer type of 

vehicle, of the type comprising an assembly of arches 
mounted on a platform (8) and supporting a foldable 

cover (3), the device comprising displacement means 
for displacing the arches carrying the cover, said 

means being suitable for displacing said arches from a 
position in which the cover is opened-out and 

installed above the platform (8) to a position in 
which the cover is folded, characterised in that it 

comprises a combination of means so that the folded 
cover occupies a minimum amount of space, namely a 

combination of: 

at least one entrainment arch (4), each of 
its ends terminating in a rolling carriage 

provided with four rollers, two upper rollers 
(14) and two lower rollers (13), which are 

suitable for rolling on both sides of a 
horizontal rail (15); 
a plurality of intermediate arches (5) 
having at least three rollers, of which the 

two lower rollers are suitable for rolling, 
with at least one upper roller, on both sides 

of a horizontal rail (15); and  
 
a cover, comprising three parts, a roof and 
two lateral faces, which cover is carried by 

the sliding arches (4, 5), tensioned by arms 
(10) when the vehicle is covered, and forming 

regular folds as a result of separators (11) 
which move outwardly when the cover is folded. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that each horizontal rail (15) is secured laterally on 

the edge of the platform (8). 
Device according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the lower ends 

of an entrainment arch (4) are joined to two endless 
entrainment chains connected by pulleys to two central 

chains actuated by a motor (6). 
Device according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that each rail (15) 

comprises a foldable extension suitable for carrying 
the assembly of arches and cover beyond the length of 

the vehicle body.  
 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the front face is 

raisable.
