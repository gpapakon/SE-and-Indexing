<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixing battery for cold and hot water with valve discs (3, 4) that are arranged upstream, rest against one another, can be moved relative to one another and have separate openings for the synchronous metering and shut-off of the inflowing cold and hot water and respective central through openings for the return of mixed water and with a downstream temperature-regulated mixing valve (5) arranged in a driver housing (42) connected to the movable valve disc. For the purpose of improvement and, in particular, adaptation to the main dimensions of mixer valves with single-handle control, the proposal is that a valve disc (3) held fixed have, at least on the face (2) that faces the movable valve disc (4), annular slots (31) situated diametrically opposite one another on a pitch circle and that the movable valve disc (4) be rotatable and have corresponding annular slots (41a, 41b) in the form of through openings, the slots extending over an arc of less than 90@.
