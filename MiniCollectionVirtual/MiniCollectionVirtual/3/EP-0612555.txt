<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the degradation of highly toxic halogenated compounds contained in SO2-free gases, in particular polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF) by oxidation with the use of hydrogen peroxide. The degradation of PCDDs and PCDFs by treating the gases with hydrogen peroxide under UV irradiation is known. According to the invention, the gas, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, is passed over an essentially inorganic solid catalyst, in particular pyrogenic or precipitated silica or aluminium silicate. A residual PCDD/PCDF content of below 0.1 ng of dry matter/m
<
3
>
 (STP) can be achieved in the treated gas; the highly toxic compounds are oxidatively decomposed on the solid catalyst.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the degradation of highly toxic 
halogenated organic compounds, in particular 

polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and 
dibenzofurans (PCDF), contained in SO₂-free gases by 

treating the gas with a peroxy compound,
 
characterised in that
 
the gas is passed at a temperature in the range from 

above its dew point to 180°C in the presence of 
hydrogen peroxide or of a compound which liberates 

hydrogen peroxide, with the exception of Caro's acid 
(H₂SO₅) or salts thereof, over a substantially 

inorganic solid heterogeneous catalyst from the range 
comprising precipitated silicas, pyrogenic and 

surface-modified silicas, silica gel, diatomaceous 
earth, natural and synthetic silicates, zeolites, 

metal oxides, mixed oxides and sintered glasses, 
supports with oxides of iron, chromium, manganese, 

vanadium, molybdenum or tungsten on their surface, 
molybdophosphates and tungstophosphates. 
Process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
treatment is performed at a temperature in the range 

between at least 5°C above the dew point and 120°C. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
an effective quantity of hydrogen peroxide is added to 

the gas to be treated and the resultant gas mixture is 
passed over the solid heterogeneous catalyst. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the solid heterogeneous catalyst is arranged in the 

form of a fixed bed or fluidised bed, preferably as a 
fixed bed.  

 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the solid heterogeneous catalyst used is one from the 

range comprising precipitated silicas and pyrogenic 
silicas together with aluminium silicate. 
Process according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the solid heterogeneous catalyst is used in pellet or 

tablet form.
