<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for individual identification using electronic interrogation by transmission and reception of signals of a certain frequency from a transmitter/receiver unit. The device comprises an identification chip (1), comprising an inactive code carrier (2), such as a SAW-component, and an antenna (4), where the antenna (4) receives the transmitted signal which then is applied to the code carrier (2), and a signal, superimposed with the individual code of the code carrier, is reflected from the code carrier (2). Two signals (f0, f1) of different frequencies are mixed after reception by the antenna (4), and are applied to the code carrier (2), which reflects a coded signal (f2'). This coded signal (f2') is mixed with the first transmitted signal (f0) to provide a second coded signal (f1'), having a frequency corresponding to the frequency of the second transmitted signal (f1).

<DESCRIPTION>
 IDENTIFICATION DEVICE.1The present invention concerns a method for individual identification using electronic interrogation, and an identification chip for this purpose, according to the introductory part of patent claim 1, resp. 2. The invention is based upon an identification chip having an inactive code carrier, which typically comprises a so-called SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) - component. Such SAW-components are well known for individual identification. The SAW- component is coded, so that each chip has its own code, which gives a unique identification of the chip, and the object to which it is fastened. In addition, each chip contains an antenna, and optionally components for impedance matching and physical encapsulation.The use of such indentification chips is based upon a central unit comprising a transmitter and a receiver, generating a microwave signal, which is transmitted and received by the antenna on the identification chip. The signal is then converted to an acoustic surface wave, which propagates along the SAW-component, and gives reflections, mirroring the code of this component. These reflected signals are then converted to an electronic signal. This signal is transmitted from the chip and is received by the receiver in the central unit, where it is further processed for dermining the individual identification. There are many different embodiments of these components in respect of code methods, code length, physical geometry, choice of material, etc. Furthermore, it is also known to use so-called BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) - components for similar purposes.A disadvantage with SAW-chips is that they are relatively narrow-banded, so that each kind of chip must be manufactured with a special geometry. This makes it more difficult to provide efficient utilization of frequencies above 1 GHz.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and a device for individual identification using electronic interrogation of the above mentioned kind which permits a more flexible use of frequencies. The object of the invention is achieved with a method having features as stated in the characterizing part of patent claim 1 and an identification chip for use in connection with the invention is stated in the characterizing part of patent claim 2. Further features in the device are stated in the dependent claims. 

 In the following, a preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a device for
