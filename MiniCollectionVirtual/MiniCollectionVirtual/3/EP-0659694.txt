<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is described for treating polluted 
water. The apparatus comprises a supply system (5) for 

polluted water; an activated-sludge reactor (1); one or 
more filter membrane modules (2); an air supply system (3) 

and a discharge system (4) for the treated water. The 
filter membrane modules (2) comprise hollow membranes (6) 

with a casing (7). Said filter membrane modules (2) on one 

side adjoin the activated-sludge reactor (1) and on the 
other side adjoin air distribution means (8). The activated-sludge 

reactor (1) communicates, via a bypass line 
(9), with a sludge receiving container (10) which adjoins 

the air distribution means (8). The apparatus functions in 
such a way that the water to be treated and air supplied 

are flowing in the same direction through the hollow 
membranes (6), the permeate flowing through the membranes 

towards the space between the casing (7) and the membranes 
(6), where it is discharged via permeate discharge 

system (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
treating polluted water, as described in the preamble of claim 1.An apparatus of this type is known from the
European Application EP-A-0 510 328. The apparatus
described herein comprises a treatment tank, the activated-sludge
reactor, in which a number of filter membrane
modules are suspended parallel to one another with a
certain spacing. The filter membrane modules are preferably
constructed in the form of porous flat filter plates, the
outermost walls being formed by the membrane. The filter
membrane modules are suspended in a housing which is open
both at the top and the bottom. The water to be treated is
filtered through the membranes by making use of a vacuum
pump on the filtrate side in order for the water, which
passes the membranes from the reactor and arrives in the
porous space of the filter plates, to be drawn off as clean
water. In order to prevent undesirable deposition and
accretion of layers on the outside of the membranes,
provision is made of an air supply system which blows air
in the upward direction. Since said air supply is a very
critical factor and both too low and too high an air supply
rate result in deposition and accretion of layers on the
outside of the membrane, provision is additionally made in
the said application for air distribution means. The aim is
to achieve, with the aid of said means, a uniform
distribution of the air stream across the membranes, as a
result of which deposition of solid particles is largely
prevented.The abovementioned apparatus does have the
drawback, however, that even if the said air distribution
means are used, the flow coefficient of the water to be
treated and the air supplied is not readily controllable.
It is generally found that tie mass transfer coefficient
between membrane plate and liquid is relatively low, which 
means rapid deposition and accretion of fouling layers on
the membrane. Besides, the apparatus according to
EP-A-0 510 328 has the drawback that the water to be
treated has to be drawn through and from the filter
membrane modules by means of a pump. A further important
drawback is that the periodical cleaning required of the
membrane plates requires these to be removed from the
reactor.The object of the present invention is to avoid the
abovementioned drawbacks, to which end the invention is
characterized as given in the characterizing part of claim 1.The activated-sludge reactor, the filter membrane
modules, the air distribution means and the sludge
receiving container
