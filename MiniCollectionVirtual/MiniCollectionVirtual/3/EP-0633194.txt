<ABSTRACT>
The mailing envelope has a front sheet section (1) and a rear sheet section (2). Adjoining the front sheet section is a folded-back flap (9) which protrudes into the gap between the front (1) and the rear sheet section (2). The mailing envelope is closed by an adhesive strip (10) which connects the rear sheet section (2) to the flap (9). Furthermore, the mailing envelope has lateral, folded-over flaps (6,7), by means of which the front sheet section (1) of the envelope is bonded to the rear sheet section (2). Mounted at the free edge (8) of each flap (6,7) is an adhesive section (4) which extends visibly beyond the free edge (8) and has a colouring which contrasts with the colour of the sheet section (1,2). A further correspondingly coloured adhesive section (5) is located on the base of the folding point (3) between the front sheet section (1) and the folded-over flaps (6,7). If the mailing envelope is separated at the adhesive sections (4,5) in an unauthorised manner in order to remove the contents and is then closed again, this unauthorised manipulation is indicated visually by incorrect positioning at the adhesive sections (4,5). Printed on the flap (9) is an identification marking (19) which (19a) is repeated on an attachment strip (14) which is releasably connected to the envelope via a perforation (18).

<CLAIMS>
A mailing envelope with provisions for a 
visual indication of unauthorized manipulations on same, 

with a front (1) and a rear sheet section (2) integrally 
connected thereto, which sheet sections (1, 2) are interconnected 

at two opposite edges by respective flaps (6, 
7) integrally connected to a respective sheet section (1, 

2) at a fold site (3) and glued onto the respective other 
sheet section (2, 1) by means of an adhesive material (4, 

5), which flaps (6, 7) comprise, therefore, each a fold 
edge and a free edge (8) located oppositely thereto,
 
characterized in that the adhesive material (4, 5) incorporates 

a colour which is in contrast to the colour of 
the sheet sections (1, 2) and comprises a section (4) 

which projects visible in a line-like manner under the 
free edge (8) of a respective flap and a section (5) located 

at the bottom of the fold of the fold site (3), as 
well. 
Mailing envelope according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the rear sheet section (2), seen in 

the direction of the height of the mailing envelope, is 
shorter than the front sheet section (1), and in that a 

folded back flap (9) adjoins the front sheet section (1) 
and projects into the interstice between the front (1) 

and the rear sheet section (2). 
Mailing envelope according to claim 2, 
characterized in that an adhesive agent strip (10) with a 

pull-off protection strip (11) is connected to the rear 
sheet section (2) at the area of the upper free edge (12) 

of the rear sheet section (2) at a distance from the free 
edge (12), such that the rear sheet section (2) includes 

a free strip (13) extending along the upper free edge 
(12), which adhesive agent strip (10), when the protection 

strip (11) is pulled off, can be adhered to the free 
strip (13) and the folded back flap (9).  

 
Mailing envelope according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by at least one sheet-like, 

inscribable attachment strip (14) which is releasably 
connected to one of the sheet sections (1 or 2, respectively), 

which is adapted to receive a confirmation 
of receipt. 
Mailing envelope according to one of the 
preceding claims, with an address-viewing window (15) 

with a transparent foil (20) in the front sheet section 
(1), characterized in that the foil (20) is connected to 

the front sheet section (1) by an adhesive which renders 
a manipulation visible and possibly discolours upon a 

contacting with a solvent, and in that an opaque covering 
sheet (16) is present, which can be selectively adhered 

to the inner side of the front sheet section (1) for a 
covering of the address-viewing window. 
Mailing envelope according to the claims 2 
and 4 or 3 and 4, characterized in that an identification 

marking (19) is arranged on the folded back flap (9), 
which is repeated on the at least one attachment strip.
