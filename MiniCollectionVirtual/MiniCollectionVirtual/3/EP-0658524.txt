<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a glass polarizer having a 
copper and/or cadmium halide crystal phase. Glass polarizers, produced from silver halide-containing 
glasses such as described by U.S. Patent 
3,540,793 and made polarizing according to U.S. Patent 
4,304,584; 4,4479,819, display parallel and perpendicular 
absorption curves which reverse in magnitude and cross over 
in the visible wavelength region at about 480 nm. This has 
prevented the silver halide glasses from being considered 
for use as a visible polarizer, that is, for applications 
that require polarization in the same direction across the 
entire visible wavelength region of the spectrum. As used 
in this application, the term "visible polarizer" means a 
polarizer that provides effective polarization of radiation 
across the entire visible wavelength region of the 
spectrum, essentially 400-700 nm. Photochromic glasses containing copper and/or cadmium 
halide are known from U.S. Patent 3,325,299. They can be 
made polarizing in the darkened state as described by U.S. 
Patent 3,954,485. For non-photochromic-glasses see U.S. 
Patent 5,281,562. Glasses made polarizing in the infra-red 
are also shown by Japanese Published Application 4-279,337. Polarizers useful in the visible wavelength region of 
the spectrum, that is, 400-700 nm, have heretofore been 
produced from plastic materials. The disadvantages of such 
materials are well known. They cannot withstand elevated  
 
temperatures, scratch easily, bleach under intense light, 
and may undergo distortion under pressure. The present invention provides a glass polarizer that 
is effective throughout the entire visible wavelength 
portion of the spectrum. The glass polarizer has a sharp 
cutoff in transmission at about 400 nm, which removes 
harmful ultra-violet rays. This is of particular value in 
LCD displays to protect the color filter. The invention 
further provides a method of producing such a glass 
polarizer from glasses containing copper halide crystals. The product of the invention is a glass polarizer that 
provides effective polarization of radiation across the entire 
visible wavelength region of the spectrum, the glass having 
an R₂O-Al₂O₃-B₂O₃-SiO₂ base composition, a precipitated crystal 
phase consisting of a halide selected from the group 
consisting of cuprous, cadmium and mixed cuprous-cadmium 
halides, the volume fraction of the crystals being greater 
than 0.003, the crystals in the crystal phase being elongated 
and oriented, and at least a portion of the crystals
