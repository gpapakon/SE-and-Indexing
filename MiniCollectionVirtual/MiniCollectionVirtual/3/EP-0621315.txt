<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic composition with a granular surface 
appearance like marble is produced by mixing and 

dispersing 0.001-10 parts by weight of thermosetting 
resin with 100 parts by weight of thermoplastic resin. 

The impact strength and other properties of the base 
resin are maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a thermoplastic
composition with a granular surface appearance like marble that
can be used for an interior or exterior decorating material.Polycarbonate resins, which are typical thermoplastic
resins, are widely used as high performance resins with high
impact resistance, high heat resistance, and excellent
environmental resistance (engineering plastics). Also,
crystalline resins such as polyethylene terephthalate and
polybutylene terephthalate are engineering plastics with superior
heat resistance and electrical properties and are widely used.In the past, a technology capable of producing a casting
with a granular surface appearance like marble by adding glass
powder, rayon resin, and other inorganic materials to plastics
commonly referred to as general-purpose resins, and dispersing in
the base resin has been disclosed.In the resins with a granular surface appearance like marble
produced by conventional technology, for example, when a
polycarbonate resin is used as the base resin, the excellent 
properties of the polycarbonate resin such as impact strength,
environmental resistance and other physical and mechanical
properties cannot be expected, and because of its lack of heat
resistance, it is not possible to produce a casting with a good
surface appearance.WPI AN-92-214205 discloses the manufacture of stone-like
artificial marble by molding a mixture containing a base epoxy
resin with a hardener, a hardening accelerator, a filler selected
from silica, aluminium hydroxide, glass powder and calcium
carbonate, a patterning material e.g. an epoxy resin, an
unsaturated polyester resin and vinyl acetate resin and hardening
the molding.The objective of the present invention is to eliminate the
conventional problems described above and to produce a
thermoplastic composition with a granular surface appearance like
marble by a simple method.The objective described above can be achieved with a
thermoplastic composition when a granular surface appearance like
marble is produced by mixing and dispersing 0.001-10 parts by
weight of a thermosetting resin with 100 parts by weight of a
thermoplastic resin.For the thermoplastic resins used as the base resin in the
structure described above, for polycarbonate resins, those
produced by the polymerization method are widely used, as well as
aromatic polycarbonate resins produced by the hot-melt method 
(for example, see Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. Sho
63[1988]-215763, and Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. Hei
2[1990]-124934
