<ABSTRACT>
A method of flattening diamond, including: forming a 
flat coating comprising a material different from 

diamond, on a surface of diamond having unevenness; and 
removing the coating and the unevenness of the surface of 

diamond by dry etching under a condition such that both of 
the coating and the diamond can be etched, thereby to 

smooth the surface of the diamond.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
polishing and/or flattening single crystal (monocrystal) 
or polycrystal diamond, and particularly to a method of 
polishing and/or flattening diamond so as to provide a 
diamond substrate having a surface such that it is 
applicable to various elements, devices and instruments 
such as cutting instruments, wear resisting instruments, 
surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, semiconductor 
devices, large-area heat sink and diamond lenses. Diamond not only has an excellent light transmitting 
property over a wide wavelength range extending from an 
infrared region to an ultraviolet region except for a 
part of the infrared region, but also has an excellent 
pressure resistance, and further diamond is the hardest 
material among all materials which are present on the 
earth. Therefore, diamond is the best material for 
optical use because it is substantially free from 
scratches. Further, diamond has the highest Young's modulus 
among all the materials, so that when a surface acoustic 
wave is induced, the wave is propagated through diamond  
 
at a very high speed. Therefore, diamond has attracted 
much attention as a material applicable to a highfrequency 
band-pass filter to be used for a vehicular 
communication system, etc., and the application thereof 
is under investigation. Further, diamond has the largest thermal 
conductivity among all the materials, and therefore the 
application thereof to a heat sink for a device such as 
semiconductor laser and IC has also been investigated. Moreover, it has been attracted much attention to 
apply diamond to a material for a device which is stably 
operable under severe environmental conditions, e.g., at 
high temperature, under radiation, etc., or is durably 
operative even at a high output. A reason for the operativeness of diamond at a high 
temperature is its band gap as large as 5.5 eV. In other 
words, intrinsic range, i.e., a temperature range where 
carriers of semiconductor diamond cannot be controlled is 
absent at 1400Â°C or below. As a process for artificially synthesizing diamond, 
an ultra-high pressure synthesizing method has heretofore 
been employed, but recently diamond crystal has also been 
synthesized by use of a vapor-phase synthesizing method. 
Under these circumstances, the application of diamond to 
optical materials, semiconductor materials, etc., has 
increasingly been expected.  
 Recently, in a case where diamond is applied to a 
surface acoustic wave device, a semiconductor device, a 
hea
