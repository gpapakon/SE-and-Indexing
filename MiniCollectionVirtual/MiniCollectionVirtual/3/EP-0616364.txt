<ABSTRACT>
When an ingot is sliced into wafers, they are given serial numbers for identification. This makes possible 
to identify which any wafer being processed is of those sliced from the ingot no matter where the wafer is 

in a manufacturing process. Each wafer is traced so as to determine the path along which the wafer was 
transferred during the manufacturing process, and results are stored as wafer information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
and method of manufacturing semiconductor wafers and more 
particularly, to tracing of manufacturing history. For semiconductor wafers of silicon, germanium, 
gallium arsenide (GaAs), etc. for use as the material of 
IC, LSI or the like, a higher quality of the wafers has 
been demanded year after year as highly integrated 
devices are required. Even when semiconductor wafers are processed by the 
same processing machine, the quality of each of the 
wafers may differ to such an extent that badly affects a 
non-defective rate. Accordingly, for the purpose of 
improving the quality, it is necessary to accumulate such 
data that show a correlation between quality and working 
conditions on the wafer basis. Conventionally, semiconductor wafers are 
manufactured on a lot basis (a group of about 20-300 
wafers having same characteristics required), and quality 
information including operation results are managed 
usually in the form of a daily report in which the  
 
quality information is listed by an operator on a lot 
basis. However, this method has a problem that important 
wafer-based quality information such as, from which 
position of a material ingot, a wafer was cut out, by 
which thermal treatment machine, the wafer was processed, 
at which position of a bath of a cleaning equipment, the 
wafer was cleaned, etc. cannot be managed, thus resulting 
in lack of the necessary information for quality 
improvement. Further, since the management of the 
quality information is manually carried out in this 
method, this results in reduction of the reliability of 
the information and in the increased number of necessary 
management steps. Furthermore, since the management is carried out on 
a lot basis, in the case where the next step is such a 
batch processing step as a cleaning or chemical treatment 
step, the processing cannot proceed to the next step 
until one-lot processing is finished, which results in 
the fact that a wait time is increased and thus a 
processing time includes a useless waste time, which 
impedes, in particular, cost reduction in a recent 
tendency of small number/multiple sorts of items 
production. In general, for the purpose of managing objects to 
be processed on an individual basis, there is employed 
such a method that a bar code or marker is applied to 
each of the objects and object management is effected on  
 
the basis of the bar code or mark as an identification 
symbol. When the objects are semiconductor wafers, 
however,
