<ABSTRACT>
A masking device for use by hairdressers during hair treatment 
comprises an elongate single sheet of substantially transparent 

flexible material (1), having apertures (3) therethrough spaced 
along a line transverse to the longitudinal axis of the sheet and 

disposed at a median portion thereof. On said sheet there is 
provided at least one adhesive zone extending transversely to 

said longitudinal axis and disposed over or substantially 
adjacent to said plurality of apertures to hold the treated hair 

in position between the two portions of the sheet which are held 
together by the adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device to facilitate treatment 
of hair when it is being dyed, bleached or coloured, and to a 
method of treating hair using such a device. More particularly, 
it relates to a masking device through which selected strands of 
hair may be pulled for treatment, as described above, without the 
remainder of the hair in the area being so treated, and to 
methods of using the device for treatment of hair. It is fashionable to highlight and streak hair but it is not 
always easy to colour only selected strands, without colouring 
the remainder of the hair, and it is even more difficult to 
colour the selected strands right down to their roots where they 
meet the scalp. One method which has been suggested for dealing with this problem 
is to apply a cap to the head, which cap is provided with holes 
through which the strands of hair may be drawn. This method is 
satisfactory in as much as only selected strands are coloured, 
but it is difficult to colour such strands close to the roots 
since usually, the whole head of hair has been brushed in one 
direction beneath the cap and it is not possible to pull out the 
strands to the required depth. Other attempts to solve this problem have been made, such as are 
known from EP 0 122 145. The masking device as disclosed in this 
application provides a pair of pivotable portions adapted to 
enclose selected strands of hair and the portions may be provided 
with a layer of adhesive material, on at least one side, adapted 
to hold the hair which is passed between the portions. This 
adhesive zone is disposed around an edge of the portion remote 
from the pivoting point. This enables the two portions to be 
adhered together once hair is passed between them, having been 
treated. However, neither of the above solutions are entirely 
satisfactory.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a 
masking device for use by hairdressers which enables selected 
strands of hair to be treated without treating the remainder of 
the hair and which enables the treatment to extend as far as 
possible toward the root of the hair. According to the present invention, there is provided a masking 
device for use by hairdressers comprising an elongate single 
sheet of substantially transparent flexible material, said sheet 
having a plurality of apertures therethrough spaced along a line 
transverse to the longitudinal axis of the sheet and disposed at 
a median portion thereof, and on said sheet, at least one 
adhesive zone extending

<CLAIMS>
A masking device for use during treatment of hair, 
characterised in that it comprises an elongate single sheet of 

substantially transparent flexible material (1), said sheet 
having a plurality of apertures (3) therethrough spaced along a 

line transverse to the longitudinal axis of the sheet and 
disposed at a median portion thereof, and on said sheet, at least 

one adhesive zone (4) extending transversely to said longitudinal 
axis and disposed over or substantially adjacent to said 

plurality of apertures (3). 
A masking device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that one or more additional adhesive zones (5 and 6) are provided 

on said sheet (1), optionally spaced closely from said first 
mentioned adhesive zone (4). 
A masking device as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the or each adhesive zone (4, 5 and 6) 

comprises a layer of contact adhesive. 
A masking device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a layer of release material is 

normally disposed on the or each adhesive zone, said layer being 
removable when adhesive functions are required. 
A masking device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that clip means are adhered to one or more of 

said adhesive zones to hold together opposed halves or portions 
of the single sheet. 
A masking device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the clip means are of plastics or metal material. 
A masking device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises additional apertures 

spaced along one or more lines, each line being substantially 
 

parallel to the first mentioned line and spaced therefrom. 
A masking device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in 
that the apertures of each line are aligned from one line to the 

next or alternatively, the location of apertures in each line are 
staggered in relationship to the location of the apertures in an 

adjacent line. 
A masking device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the transparent flexible material 

is a plastics or paper foil. 
A method of treating hair to colour, bleach or dye selected 
strands of hair, characterised in that the method comprises 

providing a masking device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, applying the device to a head of hair, drawing selected 

strands of hair through the apertures of the device, arranging 
said strands along sai
d sheet, treating the strands as desired, 
and folding the device to adhere to itself and to enclose the 

treated strands of hair.
