<ABSTRACT>
An elastic fixing roll (10) having an elastic, compliant body material 
(1) and 

release surface material (5) is disclosed. The body material (1) 
comprises porous 

silicone rubber, fluorosilicone rubber, or fluorocarbon rubber foam, or 
a porous 

synthetic polymer foam reinforced with silicone rubber, fluorosilicone 
rubber, or 

fluorocarbon rubber. The release surface material (5) is formed of porous 
polytetrafluoroethylene film containing silicone rubber, fluorosilicone 

rubber, or 
fluorocarbon rubber and is bonded to the body material by a 

non-continuous 
layer of adhesive (6). The elastic fixing roll has good strength, 

resilience, and 
heat resistance and is suitable for use in hot toner fixing assemblies of 

copying machines and printing machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elastic fixing roll, more particularly to
an elastic roll suitable for use as a heating roll or pressure roll in a heated
toner fixing assembly of a photocopy machine or printing machine.In a plain-paper copying (PPC) machine toner images applied to the
surface of paper or other recording medium are fixed by application of heat
and pressure. In certain PPC machines toner fixing is accomplished by
passing the image-bearing recording medium between a hot thermal-fixing
roll and a pressure roll to fuse the toner in place so that it is not easily
removed from or is difficult to smear on the surface of the paper or other
recording medium. When this type of thermal-fixing device is used the toner
material is directly contacted by a roll surface and a portion of the toner
adheres to the roll surface. Unless this is controlled, with subsequent rotation
of the roll the adhered toner material may be redeposited on the recording
medium resulting in undesirable offset images, stains, or smears; or, in severe
cases, the recording medium may stick to the adhered toner material on the
roll and become wrapped around the roll.To perform satisfactorily in a thermal fixing assembly the material
forming the pressing surfaces should be sufficiently temperature resistant to
operate at the temperatures required to fuse the toners, capable of complying
to and applying uniform pressure to the toner images, and have, or have
imparted to their surface, release properties that minimize toner pickup.
Additionally, these materials should be sufficiently durable in performing these
fucnctions to be cost-effective.In the past, solid rolls consisting of elastic materials such as urethane
rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, silicone rubber, or fluorocarbon rubber
have been used. Such elastic materials, when used alone, suffer the
drawback of having relatively poor release properties and toner particles,
paper particles, and the like, would cling to the rolls and lead to reduced image 
quality and a shorter use-life. When used in conjunction with release agents,
for example, silicone oils applied to their surfaces, or release agents present in
oil-less toners, improved release properties were obtained, however, often at
the expense of durability as many of the elastic materials were degraded by
the release agents and failed prematurely.To overcome these problems solid rolls of elastic materials with a
covering layer of fluoropolymer film or shrink-fit tubing have come into use.
