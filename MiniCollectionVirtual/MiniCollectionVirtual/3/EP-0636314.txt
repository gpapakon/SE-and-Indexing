<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a tape including a base layer containing substantially no 
active agent and a coating film layer containing a heat-vaporizable active agent and being 

formed on one side of the base layer by application of a coating containing the active 
agent. Also disclosed is a method of heat vaporizing an active agent which comprises 

moving the tape on a heater element while allowing the non-coated side of the base layer 
of the tape to come into contact with the heater element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape used for the heat vaporization of active
agents such as insecticides, bactericides, fungicides and aromatizing agents. It also
relates to a method for vaporizing these agents by heating the tape.The vaporization of insecticides has hitherto been effected by electrically
heating the so-called mosquito-killing mat. In usual cases, the mat is effective only for
about 8 hours, and it is, therefore, necessary to change the mat many times to maintain
insecticidal effect for a long period of time.There can be found several methods for the prolonged heat vaporization of a
active agent by allowing a tape impregnated with the agent to pass through a heater
element (see, e.g., JP-Y 51-51884/1976, JP-B 55-43727/1980, JP-A 57-155935/1982,
JP-Y 4-4538/1992, JP-Y 4-4539/1992, JP-Y 4-4540/1992, JP-B 4-34362/1992).However, these methods for the prolonged heat vaporization of an active
agent have not yet been widely used up to the present. EP-A-239 802 discloses a tape
comprising a base layer and a coating layer containing a heat vaporizable active agent on
one side of the base layer. The tape can contact a heating element to vaporize the active
agent, which active agent can be insecticidal, bactericidal or fungicidal. GB-A-2166957
discloses a tape for use in vaporizers comprising a film possessing heat resistance and
impermeability to liquids laminated to one side of a soft porous tape which is
impregnated with at least one vaporisable substance.Under these circumstances, the object of the present invention was to provide a method
for the prolonged heat vaporization of an active agent. As a result, it has been found that
relatively high temperatures are usually required to completely vaporize an active agent
by heating a tape impregnated with the active agent, which may cause partial vaporization
or decomposition of the active agent, resulting in a decreased efficiency for vaporization.
As a solution, an improved tape from which the active agent can be effectively and stably
heat-vaporized for a long time is provided. Thus, the present invention provides a tape comprising a base layer containing
substantially no active agent and a coating film layer containing a heat-vaporizable
active agent and being formed on one side of the base layer by applying a coating
containing the active agent onto the base layer,
wherein the coating is a member selected from oil paint, fibrous coating, synthetic resin
enamels and varnishes, and fluoropolymer resin enamels and varnishes, and the
thickness
