<ABSTRACT>
Mounting of a bearing with rolling bodies (13) located between an outer race (14) and an inner race (15) on a shaft (16) in which the inner race (15) is carried by an intermediate bush (17) integral with the said shaft (16), characterised in that the bush (17) has a domed outer surface the top of which is in contact with the inner surface (15i) of the inner race (15) of the bearing and inner bearing surfaces (20, 21) which are locally immobilised in contact with the shaft (16).

<CLAIMS>
A bearing assembly with rolling bodies (13) disposed between an
outer ring (14) and an inner ring (15) on a shaft (16) in which the inner ring (15) is

borne by an intermediate bushing (17) rigid with the shaft (16), characterised in that
the bushing (17) comprises a convex outer surface whose apex is in contact with the

inner surface (15i) of the inner ring (15) of the bearing and inner journal bearings
(20, 21) locally locked in contact with the shaft (16).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the assembly
journal bearings (20, 21) of the bushing (17) are bound on the shaft (16) and are

axially located on either side of the diamctrical plane containing the apex of the
convex outer surface of the bushing.
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that one end of the bushing (17) extends radially in contact with an abutment

shoulder (22) borne by the shaft (16) and in that the other end of the bushing (17)
extends axially in contact with a threaded journal bearing (23) of the shaft (16).
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the coefficient of expansion of the bushing is lower than the coefficient of

expansion of the shaft.
An assembly as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the
coefficient of expansion of the bushing is higher than the coefficient of expansion of

the ring.
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the convex surface of the bushing (17) is formed by machining.
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the bushing
(17) is mounted in axial compression between the abutment shoulder (22) borne by

the shaft (16) and the force of a clamping nut (24) and is subject to a radial expansion
force under the action of the clamping effort exerted by this nut (24).
