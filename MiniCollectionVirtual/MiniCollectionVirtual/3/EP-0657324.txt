<ABSTRACT>
Roof rail in which the beam (1) is gripped from below in the region of each curved section (2) by a support foot (5). The support foot has on the upper side a groove (12) which fits round a part-section of the beam circumference. Each support foot is attachable to the vehicle roof and has a lower support surface (11) in contact with the roof contour, and an upper concave surface in contact with the beam. The assembly is secured by bolts (6 8).

A roof handrail for vehicles, with a tubular 
banister (1) positioned in parallel at a distance from 

the roof surface (4) extending along a lateral roof 
frame and with two supporting elements (5, 50) 

positioned at the banister's ends for the fixing of the 
roof handrail on the vehicle roof, wherein the banister 

is formed at the ends with a respective bending (2), 
characterised in that the banister (1) is supported 

near each bending (2) by a supporting element (5, 50) 
which is fixed on the banister (1), and which is 

provided on its upper side with a groove (12, 52), 
which surrounds a part of the banister's circumference, 

and in that each supporting element (5, 50) is in turn 
fixable on the vehicle's roof. 
A roof handrail according to claim 1, characterised 
in that each supporting element (5, 50) is provided 

with a lower supporting surface (11, 51) supported by 
the. vehicle roof and an upper concave supporting 

surface (12, 52) adapted to the respective bending (2) 
of the banister (1) for the banister (1) and which is 

screwable on one side with the vehicle roof and on the 
other side with the banister (1). 
A roof handrail according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that each supporting element (5) is 

screwable from the lower side with the banister (1) and 
from the lower side with the vehicle roof. 
A roof handrail according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that each supporting element (50) is 

screwable from the lower side with the banister (1) and 
from the upper side with the vehicle roof. 
A roof handrail according to at least one of the 
claims 1 2, or 4, characterised in that each supporting 

element (50) carries a cover cap (57), which optically 
forms a supporting foot and which is in contact with 

the respective bending (2) of the banister (1), wherein 
the cap is provided with a U-formed section, with limbs 

(58), which are parallel to the banister (1) and which 
are directed with their free ends towards the 

respective end of the banister. 
A roof handrail according to claim 5, characterised 
in that each supporting element (50) carries a cover 

cap (57) which extends over the axial portion of a 
bending (2) on the banister (1).
