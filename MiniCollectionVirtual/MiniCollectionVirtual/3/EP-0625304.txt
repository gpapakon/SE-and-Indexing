<ABSTRACT>
A frame (10) carries horizontal, parallel, journaled, cylindrical 
bearings (26, 28), upon which rotatably rests the cylindrical 

external surface a wheel (30) having, on its outside periphery, 
ports (44) communicating with respective moulds (45) which are 

radially arranged side by side in the wheel. Plungers (46) are 
slidably received in the moulds. Feeder means (52) stationary 

with respect to the wheel (30) deliver pasta filata into at 
least one of the ports. Ejector means (48, 50) stationary with 

respect to the wheel (30) eject pasta filata from at least one of 
said moulds (45) through its associate port. Driving means (38, 

40, 41, 42, 43) move said wheel (30) in steps corresponding to 
the interval between two successive ports along the periphery of 

the wheel. Jets (66) sprinkle the moulds with chilled water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a cheese moulding and hardening 
machine. The invention is particularly applicable in the production 
of provolone, block-shaped mozzarella, and other pasta filata 
cheese, such as the one known in the art as "pizza cheese", but 
it could be applied in the production of other kinds of cheese, 
such as those known as "pecorino", "caciotta", Gouda, Edam, etc. In the production of provolone or other similar cheese such as 
block-shaped mozzarella, "pizza cheese", etc., the pasta filata in 
a plastic condition is introduced into cylindrical or prismatic 
moulds; the moulds are then chilled to harden their pasta filata 
contents; finally, the hardened cheese is removed from the moulds. In the past, the above operations were carried out by means of 
free moulds, which, after being filled with pasta filata, were 
immersed in chilled water in bulk, and had then to be taken out 
and manually emptied. In order to eliminate such manual work and 
automatize processing, IT-A-1 183 842 of 20 May 1985 provides a 
moulding and hardening machine where a large-diameter turning 
table or carousel, resting on a horizontal bedplate, carries a 
number of vertical moulds, arranged in several rows. The 
carousel moves in steps, and at each step a group of moulds is 
filled with pasta filata by feeder means. During the subsequent 
rotation of the carousel, the moulds are chilled by cold-water 
jets, and, after a full revolution, the blocks contained in the 
moulds are discharged.  
 The carousel of IT-A-1 183 842 has a typical diameter of 2 to 3 
meters, which are compounded by accessory equipment surrounding 
the carousel. Therefore, that prior machine is quite large. 
Moreover, in order to rotatably support a table of such size and 
weight, expensive machining is necessary, as well as an extremely 
stiff, and therefore heavy and expensive, bedplate. Such high 
costs are reflected also in transport and installation. Accordingly, the main object of the invention is to provide a 
cheese moulding machine, particularly for pasta filata cheese, 
having a similar performance to the above known machine, but a 
smaller size and cost. The above object, as well as other objects and advantages such 
as will appear from the following disclosure, is achieved by the 
invention by means of a cheese moulding machine, particularly for 
pasta filata cheese, comprising: 
a) a frame in which at least two horizontal, parallel, cylindrical 
bearings are journaled; b) a wheel having at least one circular cylindrical

A cheese moulding machine, particularly for pasta filata 
cheese, comprising: 


a) a frame (10) having at least two horizontal, parallel, 
journaled, cylindrical bearings (26, 28); 
b) a wheel (30) having at least one circular cylindrical external 
surface resting on said bearings (26, 28) and having on its 

outside periphery ports (44) communicating with respective moulds 
(45) which are radially arranged in the wheel side by side, and 

wherein respective plungers (46) are slidably received; 
c) feeder means (52) stationary with respect to the wheel (30) for 
delivering cheese in a plastic state into at least one of said ports; 
d) ejector means (48, 50) stationary with respect to the wheel 
(30) for ejecting the cheese from at least one of said moulds (45) 

through its associate port; and 
e) driving means (38, 40, 41, 42, 43) for moving said wheel (30) 
in steps corresponding to the spacing between two successive 

ports along the periphery of the wheel. 
The machine of claim 1, characterized in that said wheel 
driving means comprise a toothed sprocket (40) driven by motor 

means (41, 42, 43) for driving a chain (38) surrounding the 
wheel (30) in driving engagement therewith.  

 
The machine of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said ejector 
means comprise linear actuators (48) arranged in a central 

position, stationary with respect to the wheel (30), and adapted 
to project radially respective rods (50) against the plungers (46) 

of respective moulds (45) when located in a predetermined 
unloading position. 
The machine of claim 3, characterized in that said 
predetermined unloading position is located in the lower area of 

the wheel (30).
