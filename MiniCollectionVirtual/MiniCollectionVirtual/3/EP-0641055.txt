<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a residual current detector, and more particularly, to a 
modular, distributed equipment leakage circuit interrupter. Various techniques have been used to minimize operator exposure to safety hazards 
such as moving parts, electrical charge or chemicals during machine operation. For example, 
safety interlock switches that inhibit machine operation when covers or doors are open with 
exposure to safety hazards are well known in the prior art. Also, well known are ground fault 
protection systems for electrical equipment to reduce risk of electric shock and injury to 
personnel and reduce the risk of fire caused by internal current flow. A difficulty with the prior art ground fault protection systems is that often such 
systems must be mounted in a service entrance panel, in a wall mounted outlet box, or in an 
electrical drop box. These prior art systems are often designed for electrical facilities and not 
for integration into products. Another difficulty is that prior art systems often operate over 
only a limited current or voltage range. In these prior art systems, many different parts and 
components are often required to cover various anticipated applications. For example, some 
prior art systems require a separate power source and therefore cannot provide complete and 
reliable protection for a product. It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide a new and improved 
ground fault protection system that is self powered to provide maximum reliability and safety 
and that is modular and distributed to allow the system to be used with a wide range of 
products. Another object of the present invention is to provide a ground fault protection 
system that allows various components to be mounted remotely from one another. Still 
another object of the present invention is to provide a ground fault protection system that is 
capable of direct integration into products or for use in an enclosure mounted in or near the 
product. The present invention provides a modular leakage current detector and interrupter 
to arrest the flow of line current to an electrical load comprising:
 
   a sense module for detecting ground fault currents in the load in excess of a given 
value, the sense module including a power supply electrically connected to the line current,
 
   interrupt circuitry responsive to the sense module to provide an interrupt signal,
 
   a circuit interrupter module responsive to the interrupt signal to disconnect line 
current to the load, and
 
   a
