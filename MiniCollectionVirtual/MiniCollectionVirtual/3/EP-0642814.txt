<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel, particularly
for skateboards or rollerskates.Conventional rollerskates in fact are now usually
constituted by a shoe having a sole associated with a frame
to which a plurality of wheels are pivoted. The wheels are
arranged either in pairs or in line.In these conventional skates the wheels may have no
central hub or may have an open hub with which a tire is
associated. The tire interacts directly with the ground.A problem that arises in the use of these conventional
wheels is that the tire has a preset rigidity which may be
excessive depending on the track or on the user's technical
skill level, thus transmitting considerable vibrations to
the frame and therefore to the user's leg.In contrast, an excessively low rigidity of the tire
leads to a rapid wear of the tire, forcing frequent
replacement of the entire wheel.This operation, besides being onerous for the user, is
not easy, because it requires particular tools such as for
example screwdrivers or adjustable wrenches.US patent no. 4,208,073 discloses a wheel for
skateboards and rollerskates which is constituted by a first
annular wheel portion, which has a low friction coefficient,
and by a second annular wheel portion, which has a high
friction coefficient. The annular portions are coaxially
associated.The outer perimetric edges have such a radius so as to
facilitate travel of the wheel over rough surfaces. However, even this solution has drawbacks, because the
annular portion which has a low friction coefficient is
necessarily relatively rigid and thus transmits directly to
the skate frame all the vibrations due to the unevenness of
the ground.In a similar way, the annular portion having a high
degree of friction is necessarily relatively soft and thus
subject to localized wear.Furthermore, the high rigidity of the wheel, i.e. of
the part which interacts with the ground, does not allow the
user to perform maneuvers that entail the separation of the
wheel from the ground (a jump), since landing is very
violent because the stresses of the impact are fully
transmitted to the foot.US-A-4 699 432 discloses a dual material roller skate
wheel having in combination features as including in the
precharacterizing portion of the appended claim 1, and
comprising in particular a central portion made of
relatively hard first material in which interstitial spaces
are defined around the surface of the central portion.
These interstitial spaces are filled with a second material
which is less hard than the first

<CLAIMS>
Wheel, particularly for skateboards or rollerskates,
comprising a tire (5,105,205,305,405) and a hub (2,102,202,

302,402), said hub having spokes (3,103,203,303,403)
extending radially from said hub and defining a plurality of

interspaces between said spokes, said tire having an outer
portion for contact with the ground and a plurality of wings

(6,106,206) adapted to at least partially affect said
interspaces and each having a free end interacting with a

facing base of said hub, characterised in that in order to
provide a varying rigidity of the tire said plurality of

wings extend at least in the interspaces between said spokes
to only partially fill the interspaces between said spokes

such that empty spaces without material are arranged between
the hub and the inner portion of the wings.
Wheel according to claim 1, characterized in that
said hub supports a bearing (4,104).
Wheel according to any one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said wings (6,106,206) are

made of materials which have different densities and
geometries according to the desired elastic response.
Wheel according to any one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said wings comprise at least

one leaf spring.
Wheel according to any one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said wings comprise at least

one elastic bearing.
Wheel according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said spokes (3,103) have a 

substantially radial extension.
Wheel according to any one or more of the preceding
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that said spokes

(203,303,403) have a substantially helical extension.
Wheel according to any one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said tire (405) comprises an

intermediate member (408) at least partially embedded in
said spokes (403) of said hub (402).
Wheel according to any one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said plurality of wings has a

degree of rigidity which is different than the rigidity of
the outer portion of said tire.
