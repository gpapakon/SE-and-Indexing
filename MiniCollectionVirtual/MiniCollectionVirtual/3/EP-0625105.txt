<ABSTRACT>
Described is a vehicle brake system in which the brake pressure at the rear axle is controlled so that it is lower than that at the front wheels. In order to achieve this, the difference (VD) between the highest front-wheel speed and the slowest rear-wheel speed is calculated and compared with a threshold value which is dependent on the vehicle deceleration. The pressure is increased until the threshold value is reached. The threshold value is greater when the vehicle is travelling straight than when it is negociating bends.

Method for operating a brake system for a motor 
vehicle, in which, during braking, a different brake 

pressure is fed in at the brakes of the rear wheels to 
that fed in at the brakes of the front wheels and the 

difference (V
D
) between the fastest front wheel and the 
slowest rear wheel is compared with a comparison value 

(VDS) dependent on the vehicle deceleration, and a change 
in pressure can be brought about at the rear wheel brakes 

as a function of this comparison, characterized in that 
an increase in pressure at the rear wheel brakes is 

prevented if the comparison value (VDS) is exceeded and 
in that weighting of the comparison value (VDS) is 

performed depending on whether straight-ahead travel is 
present or not. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the comparison value (VDS) is higher in the case of 

straight-ahead travel than in the case of cornering. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that straight-ahead travel is identified if the following 

wheel speed difference 

VXU = (V
V1
 - V
H2
) - (V
V2
 - V
H1
) 
 
does not exceed a threshold value, V
V
 denoting the speed 
of the front wheels and V
H
 denoting that of the rear 
wheels, and the numbers 1 and 2 designating vehic
le 
sides. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the difference VXU is filtered, the time constant 

of the filter depending on the vehicle deceleration.  
 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according 
to Claim 1 with first means (6), by means of which, 

during braking, a different brake pressure is fed in at 
the brakes of the rear wheels to that fed in at the 

brakes of the front wheels, and second means (4), by 
means of which the difference (V
D
) between the fastest 
front wheel and the slowest rear wheel is compared with 

a comparison values (VDS) dependent on the vehicle 
deceleration, and a change in pressure can be brought 

about at the rear wheel brakes as a function of this 
comparison, characterized in that the second means (4) 

are designed in such a way that an increase in pressure 
at the rear wheel brakes is prevented if the comparison 

value (VDS) is exceeded and in that weighting of the 
comparison value (VDS) is performed depending on whether 

straight-ahead travel is present or not. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the second means (4) are designed in such a way that 

the comparison value (VDS) is higher in the case of 
straight-ahead travel than in the case of cornering.
