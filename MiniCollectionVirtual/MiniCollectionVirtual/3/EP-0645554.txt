<ABSTRACT>
An airspring piston (10) which combines the features of being easily 
assembled, providing full air volume utilization which contributes to a low 

spring rate of an airspring assembly, a rounded outer peripheral edge (14) 
to facilitate its assembly with a beaded flexible airsleeve (32) and a bead 

retention lip (30) to retain a beaded airsleeve (34) on the piston (10) in 
low or no pressure situations. An airspring assembly comprised of the 

aforementioned piston (10), a beaded flexible airsleeve (32) and an upper 
retainer (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an airspring piston. 
More particularly, it relates to an airspring piston 
used in an airspring assembly. Stamped steel airspring pistons have been in use 
for many years, but those which have provided for 
maximum air volume to attain the desirable low spring 
rate have not provided for flexible airsleeve bead 
retention. Aluminum and plastic pistons with 
retention barbs are usually costly to produce because 
they usually require machining and, furthermore, the 
large amount of material required to reinforce those 
types of piston reduces the amount of air volume 
available for operation of an airspring assembly. The closest prior art with respect to claim 1 is known 
from DE-B-1 956 811, see figure 3, showinq an airsprinq 
piston comprising a top plate and a bottom plate axially 
spaced from the top plate, an inner tubular support connected 
between the top and bottom plates, and an intermediate 
outer wall connected between the top and bottom 
plates, the upper portion of which intermediate outer 
wall includes a rounded shoulder extending to a horizontal 
flange which forms a bead seat area, a bead retention 
lip being formed by a radially extending end portion 
of the inner tubular support. The invention is defined by an airspring piston according 
to claim 1 and an airspring according to claim 6. One aspect of the present invention is 
that the airspring piston can be easily assembled. It 
is preferably comprised of three metal stampings and one metal 
tube. The design of the top plate stamping allows it 
to function as a bumper reaction plate in an airspring 
assembly during severe jounce movements while in 
operation. It also serves as a flexible airsleeve 
bead guide to provide for easy installation of the 
airsleeve onto the piston. Moreover, its relative 
sizing in comparison to the bead seat area allows it 
to serve as a bead retention lip. The cylindrical 
piston provides support for a rolling lobe flexible 
airsleeve during operation. It can be contoured to 
modify the spring rate, however, the illustrations 
show it as being cylindrical.  
 There is also disclosed an airspring assembly 
comprised of the piston, a flexible beaded airsleeve, 
and an upper retainer. Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an airspring 
assembly utilizing the airspring piston of the instant 
invention. Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of the encircled 
portion of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a bottom plan view taken along line 3-3 
of Fig. 2. Fig. 4 is a top plan view of the piston of the 
instant

<CLAIMS>
An airspring piston comprising: 

(a) a top plate having an outer peripheral 
edge which is rounded perpendicular to the 

general plane of the plate and a plurality of 
vents; 
(b) a bottom plate axially spaced from the 
top plate; 
(c) an inner tubular support connected 
between the top and bottom plates; and 
(d) an intermediate outer wall connected 
between the top and bottom plates, the upper 

portion of which intermediate outer wall includes a rounded 
shoulder inwardly and downwardly sloping to a horizonal 

flange and a bead seat area generally 
perpendicular to the flange and connected to the 

peripheral edge of the top plate such that the 
outer surface of the bead seat is radially 

inwardly offset from the outer peripheral edge of 
the top plate to form a bead retention lip. 
The piston according to claim 1 wherein the 
bead seat area is tapered from about 2° to about 6° 

inwardly from the flange. 
The piston according to claim 1 wherein the 
lip has a radial dimension from about 1 mm to about 

2.5 mm. 
The piston according to claim 1 wherein the 
lip has a radial dimension from 1.2 mm to 2.0 mm. 
The piston according to claim 1 wherein the 
lip has a radial dimension from 1.3 mm to 1.8 mm.  

 
An airspring assembly comprising an 
airspring, an upper retainer and a beaded flexible 

airsleeve wherein the airspring piston is as described 
in claim 1.
