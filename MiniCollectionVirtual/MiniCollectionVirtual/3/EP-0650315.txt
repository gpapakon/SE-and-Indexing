<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical controller 1, in particular for installation in motor vehicles. Said controller 1 contains a printed circuit board 4 having electronic components. The printed circuit board is covered, at least on its component side 5, by a total of at least three layers made of the same plastic material, the material of the individual layers having different mechanical properties. The first layer forms base insulation 8. A supporting layer 11 is adjacent to this base insulation. Finally, a further layer is provided as the outer layer 12, which has higher strength than the two aforementioned layers.
