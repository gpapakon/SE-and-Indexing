<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor double-channel-planar-buried-heterostructure 
laser diode has a pair of double channel 

structures (26/27) provided on both sides of a multiple 
quantum well structure (23) for blocking leakage current, 

and the leakage current is decreased by a carrier density 
of a current blocking layer (26) of each double channel 

structure ranging between 3 x 10¹⁷ cm⁻³ and 1 x 10¹⁸ cm⁻³ 
and equal to or less than a carrier density of a cladding 

layer (24) on the multiple quantum well structure, a width 
of each double channel structure ranging between 3.0 

microns and 5.0 microns or a width of the multiple quantum 
well structure ranging between 1.6 microns and 2.2 microns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor double-channel-planar-buried-heterostructure 
laser diode and, more 
particularly, to a semiconductor double-channel-planar-buried-heterostructure 
laser diode available for an optical 
time domain reflectmeter or a fiber optics communication 
system. A typical example of the semiconductor 
double-channel-planar-buried-heterostructure laser diode is 
disclosed by Mito et al. in "InGaAsP Double-Channel-Planar-Buried-Heterostructure 
Laser Diode (DC-PBH LD) with 
Effective Current Confinement", Journal of Lightwave 
Technology, Vol. LT-1, No. 1, March 1983, pages 195 to 202, 
and Fig. 1 illustrates the prior art semiconductor 
double-channel-planar-buried-heterostructure laser diode. The 
prior art semiconductor double-channel-planar-buried-heterostructure 
laser diode is fabricated on a substrate 1 
of n-type indium phosphide, and the substrate 1 is oriented 
to (001) direction. According to the paper, on the substrate 1 are  
 
epitaxially grown n-type indium phosphide, indium gallium 
arsenic phosphide and p-type indium phosphide which form an 
n-type buffer layer 2, an active layer 3a, a quaternary 
layer 3 and a p-type cladding layer 4. The p-type cladding 
layer 4 is 5 x 1017 cm-3 in carrier concentration. The 
epitaxial growth is carried out in liquid phase, and an 
intermediate laminated structure is obtained. Using a photo-mask and Br-methanol solution, double 
channel forming regions 5 are formed in the intermediate 
laminated structure, and are spaced apart from each other. 
As a result, mesa stripes 6 are formed between the double 
channel forming regions 5. The double channel forming 
regions 5 are 7 microns in width and 3 microns in depth, 
and the mesa stripes 6 and the active region 3a thereof 
range from 1 micron to 3 microns in width. On the intermediate laminated structure except for 
the mesa stripes 6 are epitaxially grown p-type indium 
phosphide and n-type indium phosphide which form a p-type 
current blocking layer 7 and an n-type current confining 
layer 8. The p-type current blocking layer 7 and the n-type 
current confining layer 8 extend over the double 
channel forming regions 5, and reach side surfaces of the 
mesa stripes 6. The epitaxial growth is also carried out  
 
in liquid-phase, and the current blocking layer 7 has a 
carrier concentration of 1 x 1018 cm-3. After the 
formation of the p-type current blocking layer 7 and the n-type 
current confining layer 8, p-type indium phosphide and 
p-type indium gallium arsenic phosphide
