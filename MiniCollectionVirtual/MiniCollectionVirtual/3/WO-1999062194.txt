<ABSTRACT>
A radio is disclosed in which different waveforms may be utilized. The radio includes a memory (801) in which software (802, 805, 806) for specific waveforms is stored. The radio further includes one or more processors (807, 809, 811) which extract waveform specific software to process information for transmission or reception. All processing of the information between reception or reproduction of speech and transmission and reception of radio frequency signals, respectively, is performed in software.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTIPLE WAVEFORM SOFTWARE RADIOFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention pertains to radio transmitters and receivers.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCommercial and military radios often need to communicate or could benefit by having the capability of communicating with two or more radio networks, each of which is of a different type. One example of this need is found in the cellular telephone market where different modes of operation are presently available leading to the present need for so-called "dual mode" cellular phones. The dual modes refer to different waveforms. As used herein, "waveform" refers to functional transformation of information such as speech to a modulated rf carrier and encompasses the entire process of going from speech to antenna and/or vice versa. To operate over multiple waveforms has in the past required that various pieces of equipment be utilized. As new waveform technologies develop, existing equipment becomes unusable with such waveforms. It is desirable to provide a radio which is useable as a generic radio platform with existing waveforms and yet to be developed waveforms.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe invention will be better understood from a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawing in which like reference designators indicate like elements in the various drawing figures, and in which:Fig. 1 is a functional diagram of a radio transmit path in accordance with the invention; Fig. 2 is a partial block diagram of the transmit path of Fig. 1 ;
