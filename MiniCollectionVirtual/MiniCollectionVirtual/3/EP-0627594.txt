<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing street furniture 
improved in problems with maintenance work therefor, 

manufacturing time and effort, the precision of a product, 
and transferring and replacing of the furniture. 

The structural characteristics of this invention reside in 
street furniture (B) having a support (S) to which a 

street furniture body (B) is fixed, the support (S) being 
used to fix street furniture (B) to the ground surface, a 

floor surface or a wall surface, the support (S) consisting 
of a plurality of main plates (1) formed to a predetermined 

shape, and mounting plates (2, 3) fixed to the 
main plates (1) with bolts (4) and joined and fixed to 

the street furniture body, a wall or the ground surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the improvement of outdoor 
equipment (benches, trash baskets, ashtrays, road-crossing prevention 
fences, bumping posts, handrails, tree protectors, bus shelters, 
illumination and signboards), more in detail to the improvement of 
outdoor equipment by employing at least one supporting body made of a 
combination of plates which support the outdoor equipment and moreover 
are made of selected materials. Parks, public plazas, bus terminals, rotaries and other public 
facilities such as playgrounds are usually provided with benches, trash 
baskets, ashtrays, road-crossing prevention fences, bumping posts, 
handrails, tree protectors, bus shelters, illumination, signboards etc. 
(hereinafter referred to as outdoor equipment). Such outdoor equipment 
is provided not only in public facilities, but also, for example, in plazas on 
the rooftops of department stores or supermarkets or on the ground. Conventional outdoor equipment is usually made by artisans 
following the steps of assembling steel materials which have been 
beforehand machined in a given shape and connecting the same to one 
another by way of welding. The well-known conventional outdoor equipment, however, has the 
following drawbacks.  Firstly, artisans assemble the steel materials and connect the same 
to one another by way of welding so that the finish of products depends on 
the artisan's skill or dexterity and consequently products vary widely in 
quality. Secondly, the ratio of the artisan's wage to the product cost is very 
large, particularly in case of products of elaborate design. From a viewpoint of maintenance, coating applied to the steel 
materials of the conventional products is liable to be injured and moreover 
the coating is not stable for a long time of period, so that much 
maintenance cost against scratch or rust is required. In addition to such usual maintenance, the outdoor equipment is 
liable to be broken when a traveling vehicle runs against or scrapes it so 
that it has to be exchanged with a new one in such a case. Such an 
exchange is required also in case of breakage due to deviltry. Moreover, 
there is a case in which the outdoor equipment has to be moved to the 
other place due to the reform of the site. Conventional fixed type outdoor equipment requires much time and 
trouble for exchange or movement since the outdoor equipment is 
attached to bolts projecting from the foundation by way of mounting plates 
fixed to the outdoor equipment and thereafter is fixed thereto by way of
