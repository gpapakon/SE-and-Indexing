<ABSTRACT>
Two-way communication method between portable parts (PP) 
and radio fixed part (RFP) through repeater devices in a 

cordless DECT system wherein the transmission and the 
reception take place in FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple 

Access), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) and TDD (Time 
Division Duplex) modality by means of the base frame 

transfer divided in two half frames, each one being divided 
into 12 time slots. It foresees the duplication and 

eventually the marking, and the retransmission in 
subsequent time slots belonging to the same half frame of 

the data packets received by the repeater device (RIP).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the two-way
communication of digital signals among mobile
subscriber stations and radio fixed parts by means of
repeater devices in a cordless DECT system.The systems of private telephony comprise a plurality
of radio base transceiver stations distributed in a way to
cover the interested area, and linked to a switching
network which may be the public one or a switching network
of the Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX), and
private subscriber sets connecting via radio with the radio
fixed parts, and they are therefore able to communicate
among themselves and other fixed subscribers linked to the
public telephone network. The links may be of the vocal
type or they may allow the exchange of data by occupying
the equivalent of one or more vocal "channels".The area covered by a radio fixed part or cell is
generally quite reduced covering sometimes just a radius of
some tens or hundreds of meters. Typical applications of
the private telephone systems are found in industrial
plants where they may replace the installation of a cabled
network, and in commercial or urban centers, where they may
advantageously replace the public telephone boxes and
others.The telecommunication network for private telephony is
of the digital type. The radio access is in particular of
the type FDMA -TDMA - TDD.The system is of the TDD type as transmission and
reception do not take place simultaneously. More precisely,
as illustrated in figure 1, the base frame of 10
milliseconds is divided in two halves: in the first 5 ms 
the radio fixed part transmits and the portable sets
receive a half frame (the TX DECT half frame for the radio
fixed part, and the RX DECT half frame for the portable
set), and in the following 5 ms the contrary occurs. Each
half frame is set up by 12 time slots 1, 2, ..., 12 (from
this it results that it is a TDMA system), each one of
which is set up by 420 (or according to the some 424) bits.
The time slots are transmitted or received by using 10
different frequencies (from this it turns out to be an FDMA
system) for a total of 120 channels available to the
system, which are naturally reassigned to cells
sufficiently distant one from the other in order not to
create interference problems.Each time slot is subdivided in a synchronism field S
of 32 bits, in a field A of 8 + 40 bits with relative 16
control bits, and in a field B of 320 bits where bits are
allocated which are obtained by coding the vocal samples of
a corresponding subscriber.Figure 2 shows

which the transmission and the reception occur in TDD that is Time

Division Duplex, modality by the transfer of base frames

in N time slots, during the first of said half frames the
portable part (PP) being in transmission condition and the

radio fixed part (RFP) being in reception condition, and
during the following one of said two half frames the

portable part (PP) being in reception condition and the
radio fixed part (RFP) being in transmission condition,


characterized in that
 it includes the following steps:

transmitting by means of said portable part (PP) a
first information packet in a first time slot of the

first half frame TX-DECT for the portable part (PP);
receiving said first information packet through said
repeater device (RIP) connected between said portable

part (PP) and said radio fixed part (RFP);
storing said first information packet in said repeater
device (RIP) and duplicating it in second time slot of

said first half frame following said first time slot;
retransmitting in the same half frame to said radio
fixed part (RFP) said first information packet through

said repeater device (RIP) during a second time slot
of said first half frame (SA) following said first

time slot;
transmitting through said radio fixed part (RFP) a
second information packet in response to said first

information packet during a first time slot of said
second half frame (SB);
receiving said second information packet through said
repeater device (RIP); 
storing said second information packet in said
repeater device (RIP) and duplicating it in a second

time slot of said second half frame following said
first time slot;
modifying the information relating to the time slot
number allocated in the messages (Qt) emitted by the

radio fixed part (RFP);
retransmitting in the same half frame to said portable
part (PP) said second information packet, through said

repeater device (RIP), during a second time slot of
said second half frame (SB) corresponding to the first

time slot of said first half frame (SA) during which
