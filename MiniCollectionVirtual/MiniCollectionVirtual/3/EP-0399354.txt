<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (1) for correctly positioning dispensers (3) 
to be applied to containers (2), wherein containers (2) and 

dispensers (3) are fed in succession to an aligning conveyor 
(8) which comprises a plurality of housings (33) adapted to 

receive respective dispensers (3) and to support them 
rotatably about their respective axes. A fixed abutment 

element is arranged adjacent to the aligning conveyor (8) 
and is adapted to interfere with a portion of the peripheral 

surface of the dispensers (3) to cause a rotation of the 
dispensers (3) about their respective axes during their 

movement on the aligning conveyor (8). A photocell is 
provided for sensing the position assumed by a given portion 

of each rotating dispenser (3) , and suckers are also 
provided and controlled by the photocell in order to lock 

each dispenser (3) within the related housing (33) when a 
given position is reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
correctly positioning dispensers to be applied to 
containers. In particular, the present invention relates to an 
apparatus for transferring dispensers, having a lip for 
dispensing a liquid, and for positioning them correctly 
before they are applied to containers preferably provided 
with a handle. As known, containers are available which usually 
contain liquid products, have a handle and are provided 
upward with a dispenser which comprises a lip adapted to 
allow the outflow of the liquid on the side opposite to the 
handle side. The dispensers must be applied to the 
respective containers taking care that said lip is arranged 
in the opposite region with respect to the handle, so that 
the liquid can be dispensed from the containers in a 
comfortable and correct manner. Apparata are known which are adapted to correctly place 
the dispensers before they are applied to the containers and 
in which fixed guiding means are provided, which are adapted 
to engage given portions of the dispensers during the 
transit thereof toward the application station. However, it 
has been observed that the adoption of such fixed guiding 
means does not always allow regular placement of the 
dispensers and causes rejection of containers to which the 
dispenser has not been applied correctly. These rejects are 
obviously the cause of a decrease in the productivity of the 
machines in which the described known apparata are  
 
installed. The aim of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus for correctly positioning dispensers with respect 
to containers to which they are to be applied which is 
capable of providing better performance than known apparata, 
and which is capable of positioning the dispensers correctly 
without causing such container rejections. According to the present invention, an apparatus for 
correctly positioning dispensers to be applied to containers 
is provided which comprises first means for feeding 
containers intended to receive respective dispensers which 
substantially have the shape of a body of revolution, first 
conveyor means adapted to receive said containers from said 
first conveyor means, second conveyor means adapted to 
receive said dispensers in succession, second feeder means 
adapted to feed in succession said dispensers to said second 
conveyor means, and third conveyor means for receiving said 
containers and said dispensers respectively from said first 
conveyor means and from said second conveyor means, 
characterize

Apparatus for correctly positioning dispensers to be 
applied to containers which comprises first feeder means 

(5,6) for containers (2) intended to receive respective 
dispensers (3), first conveyor means (18, 19) adapted to 

receive said containers (2) from said first conveyor means 
(5, 6), second conveyor means (20) adapted to receive said 

dispensers (3) in succession, second feeder means (9) 
adapted to feed said dispensers (3) in succession to said 

second conveyor means (20), and third conveyor means (10) 
for receiving said containers (2) and said dispensers (3) 

respectively from said first conveyor means (18, 19) and 
said second conveyor means (20), characterized in that said 

second conveyor means comprise a conveyor (20) provided with 
a plurality of housings (33) adapted to receive respective 

dispensers (3) and to support them rotatably about their 
respective axes, there being provided a fixed abutment 

element (34) arranged adjacent to said conveyor (20) and 
adapted to interfere with at least part of the peripheral 

surface of said dispensers (3) to cause a rotation of said 
dispensers (3) about their respective axes during their 

movement by virtue of said conveyor (20), means (45) for 
sensing the position assumed by a given portion of each of 

said dispensers (3) during its rotation about its own axis, 
and retention means (43) supported by said conveyor (20) for 

locking each of said dispensers (3) within the related 
housing (33) upon said sensing means (45) detecting the 

attainment of a given position by said given portion of each 
of said dispensers (3).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said first and second conveyor means (18, 19) are 

constituted by part of a same rotary conveyor (8), said

means (18, 19). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said abutment element is constituted by a fixed curved 

housing (34,51) which is arranged adjacent to said second 
conveyor means (20) and is adapted to interfere with at
