<DESCRIPTION>
CRYSTALLOGRAPHICALLY ALIGNED FERROELECTRIC FILMS USABLE MEMORIES AND METHOD OF MAKINGSPECIFICATIONField of the InventionThe invention relates generally to ferroelectric thin films and to perovskite thin films and to their method of fabrication. In particular, the invention relates to non-volatile memories incorporating such ferroelectric thin films and to the method of growing oriented perovskite thin films usable with non-volatile memories. Background ArtFerroelectric memories have received much attention as dense, randomly addressable, non-volatile memories. A ferroelectric memory element is essentially a capacitor consisting of two electrodes and ferroelectric material filling the gap between the electrodes. At a minimum, the ferroelectric material has a very high dielectric constant, thus providing an improved dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) capacitor. Furthermore, the electrodes can induce two stable polarization states in the ferroelectric dependent on the polarity of the applied voltage, and the ferroelectric remains in the selected state after the voltage has been removed from the electrode. Thus, a ferroelectric memory can be non-volatile.Early ferroelectric memories relied on relatively thick ferroelectric bodies on opposing side of which electrodes were formed, for example, by deposition. Such a configuration is incompatible with large-scale integration and requires operational voltages considerably higher than those used with semiconductor integrated circuits. In later ferroelectric memories, a ferroelectric thin film was deposited on a metallic bottom electrode, and a top electrode was deposited on the ferroelectric thin film. This configuration and fabrication process, similar to those in semiconductor memories, offer much promise, but the polycrystalline structure of the ferroelectric film resulting from the metal substrate introduces many problems.Recently, Ramesh et al. have disclosed singly crystalline, epitaxially grown ferroelectric memories in U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 07/616,166, filed November 10, 1990, in "Epitaxial Cuprate Superconductor Ferroelectric Heterostructures," Science, volume 252, 17 May 1991, pp. 944-946, and in 

"Ferroelectric Pb&Q 2Ti0 -O thin films on epitaxial Y-Ba-Cu-O," Applied Physics Letters, volume 59, 30 December 1991, pp. 3542-3544. The patent application is incorporated herein by reference. The bottom electrode of these memories is a singly crystalline thin film of a high-temperature perovskite superconductor, for example,
