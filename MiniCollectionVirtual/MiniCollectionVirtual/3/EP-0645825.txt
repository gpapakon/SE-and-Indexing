<ABSTRACT>
An integrated electro-optical device comprises a pixellated liquid crystal 
modulation layer (6) superposed over an electronic detection layer (3). 

Modulator pads (12) for the liquid crystal layer (6) may be formed as 
electrically conductive combs to achieve optical polarisation. Where the 

liquid crystal layer provides selective absorption of unpolarised light, and 
separate polarisers between the liquid crystal and detection layers are 

therefore unnecessary, the device comprises such a liquid crystal layer 
(6) superimposed over the electronic detector layer (3). 
 
Further, an integrated electro-optical device, optionally of the above type, 
has a
 plurality of pixels (A', B') of the liquid crystal layer for each pixel 
(AB) of the detector array. This allows optical shuttering of the detector 

pixels by electrically modulating the pixellated liquid crystal layer (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated electro-optical device and to
methods of using such a device. Such a device may be used for image
processing such as dynamic optical filtering, optionally with a non-volatile
memory, of an optical image, pattern recognition, and optical
processing.Liquid crystal layers are well known as optical modulators, controlled by
an adjacent electronic backplane. Typically, ferroelectric liquid crystal
cells are used, and silicon or gallium arsenide backplanes. The parallel
input/output capability of such an optical modulator is realised by
providing local electronic processing on the same integrated circuit: an
image can be read into the electronic backplane through the transparent
liquid crystal, thresholded, and then recorded in the liquid crystal by the
application of suitable voltages to pixellated modulator pads. The
thresholded image can then be read in parallel by a read beam which is
transmitted through the liquid crystal and reflected from the backplane.
Such an arrangement is disclosed in "The design of smart SLMs and
applications in optical systems", D. Vass et al, Applied Optics and O-E
Conf, Nottingham [1990].GB-A-2 227 853 and GB-A-2 216 280 disclose a spatial light modulator
having a photoconductor which may be amorphous silicon. The
photoconductor is separated from a nematic liquid crystal by a mirror
which separates the read and write beams and reduces the effect of the 
read beam on the photoconductor. The photoconductor is used only for
optically writing data into the spatial light modulator.US-A-5 227 902 discloses an arrangement in which a liquid crystal spatial
light modulator is disposed between two photoconductive layers. The
photoconductive layers are used only for optically writing data into the
spatial light modulator from opposite sides of the arrangement.Most liquid crystal materials require an element to analyse the
polarisation state of the light in order to achieve optical modulation, and
devices of the type described above are unable to read directly onto the
electronic backplane the image which has been stored in the liquid
crystal.According to the invention, there is provided a device as defined in the
appended Claim 1.Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the other
appended claims.By providing an integrated polarising element between the liquid crystal
layer and the electronic detection layer, it is now possible to process the
image in the plane of the liquid crystal, whilst maintaining the
advantages of stability, size
