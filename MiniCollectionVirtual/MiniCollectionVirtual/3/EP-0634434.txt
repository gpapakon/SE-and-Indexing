<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyglycidyl
polyester resin and to powder coating compositions
comprising said polyglycidyl functional polyester resin.Powder coating compositions which have been known for
the longest time, namely those based on the solid
reaction products of 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and
epichlorohydrin, show only minor ultraviolet resistance
and are therefore not suitable for applications requiring
a high outdoor durability such as automotive topcoats.Triglycidylesters which can be used in outdoor
durable coatings and in moulding compositions are
disclosed in European Patent Application No. 447360
(EP-A-447,360). Due to the secondary nature of the
terminal carboxyl functions present in the tricarboxylic
acid adduct precursors, strongly alkaline conditions
should be avoided during glycidation of these
tricarboxylic acid adducts. As a result thereof the
triglycidylester produced will contain a relatively high
level of hydrolizable chlorine.This is reflected by example 2 of EP-A-447,360 which
relates to the glycidation of the 2:1 adduct of hexahydrophtalic
anhydride and dimethylolpropionic acid. The
product obtained has a chlorine content of 1.5%. Such a
high level of residual chlorine is generally undesirable
in coating compositions. In addition, due to the fact
that the triglycidylesters reported in EP-A-447,360 are
liquid, they can not be applied in powder coating
compositions. 
The most commonly used system for outdoor durable powder
coatings are polyester/triglycidylisocyanurate (TGIC).
For health and safety reasons however the use of TGIC is
viewed with suspicion.TGIC is relatively toxic (Rat Oral LD50 of 0.4 g/kg)
and is mutagenic according to the Ames Mutagenicity Test.From the above prior art discussion it follows that
there is a need for resin systems, which are particularly
suitable for use in powder coating compositions which are
relatively non toxic as compared to the current
polyester/TGIC systems and show excellent outdoor
durability in the cured state.Therefore it is an object of the invention to provide
a polyglycidyl polyester resin obtainable by reacting
linear tertiary aliphatic carboxyl functional polyester
resin with epihalohydrin. Said polyglycidyl ester resin
has been found to be
particularly suitable for use in outdoor durable powder
coating compositions which are relatively environmentally
friendly.Accordingly the invention provides polyglycidyl
polyester resin with epihalohydrin, obtainable by
reacting linear tertiary aliphatic carboxyl functional
polyes
