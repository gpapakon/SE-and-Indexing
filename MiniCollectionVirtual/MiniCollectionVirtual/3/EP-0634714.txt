<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a temperature control system for 
multi-zone temperature control with setback control. The 

system includes a thermostat (10) associated with each 
zone of a building, and a central control unit (12) which 

communicates with each thermostat (10) to send 
temperature setpoint values to each thermostat (10) for 

the purpose of conserving energy and reducing energy 
consumption during certain times of the day. Each 

thermostat (10) is associated with either a heating or 
cooling device (14), where setup temperature values are 

sent from the central control unit (12) to the 
thermostats (10) where cooling devices are used in place 

of heating devices. The thermostats (10) are designed to 
operate as stand-alone units which control the 

temperature within a zone based upon a temperature 
setpoint stored at the unit. The temperature setpoint 

values are replaced by the higher or lower temperature 
setpoint values transmitted to the thermostats by the 

control units during setback or setup time periods. To 
avoid the requirement of installing communication wires 

between the central control unit (12) and thermostat 
(10), each thermostat (10) and the central control unit 

(12) includes communications circuitry (30, 46) which 
allows the thermostats (10) and control unit (12) to 

communicate over the power conductors (36, 38) within the 
building.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
thermostats for controlling electric heating and cooling
devices. The devices are controlled to maintain the
temperature at a particular location (zone) in a building
within a selected temperature range. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a temperature control
system including a plurality of thermostats. The
thermostats communicate with a controller over the
electrical power conductors of a building, where the
controller alternates temperature setpoints at the
thermostats.Presently, a building with multi-zone electrical
heat includes zones with one or more heating units
(resistive electric baseboard or forced air heaters)
which are each controlled by a single thermostat. The
thermostats are typically of the type which have
circuitry for switching the heating units ON and OFF
based upon a comparison between a temperature setpoint 
value and the temperature monitored within the respective
zone. In particular, the thermostats may use mechanical
or electrical components and configurations to compare
the setpoint and actual temperatures, and switch the
heating units ON and OFF based upon the comparison.Setback thermostats have become commonly used in
buildings heated by a single heating unit (central
furnace) for the purpose of conserving energy; however,
the added cost of these thermostats prevents them from
being cost effective for certain buildings having multi-zone
electrical heat, and multiple thermostats.
Additionally, even if setback thermostats where installed
in every zone, it would be a burdensome task to maintain
and revise all of the setback values for every
thermostat. For example, for a building such as a home
with ten rooms each controlled as separate zones by
setback thermostats and each having 4 temperature
settings for each day of the week, the user would be
required to initially set and maintain 28 settings at 10
locations for at total of 280 settings.Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a
central controller for storing and updating temperatures
while also providing local temperature sensing and
selectable temperature control. However, existing
buildings are presently the largest market for installing
such systems with central control, and, as is known,
existing buildings, such as homes, generally are
difficult to wire for communication links such as those
required between a central controller and thermostats for
each zone. Thus, it would also be desirable to provide a
central controller and multiple thermostats which
