<ABSTRACT>
A radiant electric heater is made by providing a base (2) 
of microporous thermal and electrical insulation material 

having formed in a surface thereof at least one groove 
(9). The groove includes transverse webs (10, 10') of 

the microporous insulation material spaced apart along 
the length of the groove. An elongate electrically 

conductive strip (5) is provided to serve as a heating 
element (4) and is located edgewise into the groove and 

is urged into the webs so as to embed and secure the 
conductive strip in the webs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radiant electric heater for a 
cooker and, more particularly but not exclusively, relates 
to a radiant electric heater for use with glass-ceramic 
smooth top cookers. The invention also relates to a method 
of manufacturing such a radiant electric heater. Radiant electric heaters are known in which an element of 
coiled bare electric resistance wire is supported on, and 
secured by staples to, a layer of microporous thermal and 
electrical insulating material compacted in a metal support 
dish. Such heaters are described, for example, in 
GB-A-1 580 909 and are incorporated in glass-ceramic smooth 
top cookers. The term `microporous' is used herein to identify porous or 
cellular materials in which the ultimate size of the cells 
or voids is less than the mean free path of an air molecule 
at NTP, i.e. of the order of 100 nm or smaller. A material 
which is microporous in this sense will exhibit very low 
transfer of heat by air conduction (that is collisions 
between air molecules). Such microporous materials include 
aerogel, which is a gel in which the liquid phase has been 
replaced by a gaseous phase in such a way as to avoid the 
shrinkage which would occur if the gel were dried directly 
from a liquid. A substantially identical structure can be 
obtained by controlled precipitation from solution, the  
 
temperature and pH being controlled during precipitation to 
obtain an open lattice precipitate. Other equivalent open 
lattice structures include pyrogenic (fumed) and electro-thermal 
types in which a substantial proportion of the 
particles have an ultimate particle size less than 100 nm. 
Any of these particulate materials, based for example on 
silica, alumina or other metal oxides, may be used to 
prepare a composition which is microporous as defined 
above. The microporous insulation typically comprises a dry 
particulate microporous material as defined hereinabove 
mixed with ceramic fibre reinforcement, titanium dioxide 
opacifier and, for high-temperature use, a small quantity 
of alumina powder to resist shrinkage. Such insulation 
material is described in GB-A-1 580 909. Radiant electric heaters have also been proposed in which, 
instead of an element of coiled resistance wire, an element 
comprising an elongate electrically conductive strip of a 
metal or metal alloy is provided, the element being 
supported on edge on an insulating base. Arrangements of 
this kind are described, for example, in US-A-600 057, 
US-A-3 612 829, US-A-3 991 298, US-A-4 161
