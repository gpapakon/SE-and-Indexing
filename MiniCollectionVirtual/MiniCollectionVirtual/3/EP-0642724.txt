Vacuum-tube screen device with a stand-by control 
function which contains a power supply unit, a video 

amplifier and a picture tube which exhibits an electron 
beam generating system with a cathode heater, a cathode 

connected to the video amplifier, a control electrode, an 
at least first electron acceleration electrode and an 

anode and to which a vertical and horizontal deflection 
device belongs, of which the horizontal deflection device 

is allocated to the control electrode, the at least first 
electron acceleration electrode and the anode as voltage 

generator, characterized in that in the stand-by position 
of the vacuum-tube screen device, 


a) the vertical and horizontal deflection device (VA, HA) 
is disconnected from the power supply device (SV) and the 

video amplifier (VV) is disconnected from the cathode 
(K), 
b) the cathode heater (Kh) is connected to a heating 
current limiter (Rh) which delivers a heating current 

(Ih) which is at least slightly reduced in percentage 
compared with a predetermined nominal value, and 
c) the first electron acceleration electrode (G2) is 
connected to an output of the power supply device (SV) at 

which a voltage (UGh2) is present, the magnitude of which 
is preselected in such a manner that, in connection with 

a resistor (Rk) which is referred to earth potential and 
is connected to the cathode (K) instead of the video 

amplifier (VV), a current of the magnitude of a picture 
white value flows from the cathode (K) to the first 

electron acceleration electrode (G2), which current  
 

corresponds to an at least slight percentage proportion 
compared with a predetermined nominal value. 
Vacuum-tube screen device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the power supply device is 

implemented as main and auxiliary power supply unit (SVH, 
SVh), of which the main power supply unit (SVH) is 

connected to the vertical and horizontal deflection 
device (VA, HA) and the auxiliary power supply unit (SVh) 

is connected at least to the cathode heater (Kh) of the 
picture tube (BR), and in that, in the stand-by position 

of the vacuum-tube screen device, the main power supply 
unit (SVH) is disconnected from an alternating-current 

power system (NT) and the first electron acceleration 
electrode (G2) is connected to an output of the auxiliary 

power supply unit (SVh) at which a voltage (UGh2) is 
present, the magnitude of which is preselected in such a 

manner that, in connection with a resistor (Rk) connected 
to the cathode (K), a current of the magnitude of a 

picture white value flows from the cathode (K) to the 
first electron acceleration electrode (G2), which current 

corresponds to an at least slight percentage proportion 
co
mpared with a predetermined nominal value. 
Vacuum-tube screen device according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the heating current (Ih) is 

reduced by 25% in the stand-by position of the vacuum-tube 
screen device. 
Vacuum-tube screen device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the slight 

percentage proportion of the picture white value is 5% 
compared with the predetermined nominal value.
