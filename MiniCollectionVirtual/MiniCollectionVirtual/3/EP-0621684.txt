<ABSTRACT>
A low-distortion, high-power, feed-forward amplifier is disclosed which 
is particularly well-suited for cellular radio applications. An illustrative embodiment 

comprises a main amplifier (143) and a pair of correction amplifiers (147,1411), 
which each are used to eliminate different distortion products introduced by the main 

amplifier (143) into the amplified signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to amplifiers.It is often advantageous in electric circuits to amplify a complex signal
having multiple sinusoidal components (i.e., a multi-tone signal) without introducing
distortion products into the amplified signal. The physical characteristics of
contemporary amplifiers are such, however, that amplifiers do, in fact, inject
distortion into the signal, especially when high-power amplification is performed.
Distortion reduction in high power multi-tone amplifiers can be achieved with feedback,
predistortion, and feed-forward mechanisms. At high frequencies feed-forward
produces the most significant reduction in distortion.According to this invention there is provided an
amplifier as claimed in claim 1.Embodiments of the present invention are capable of amplifying a high
frequency, complex signal having multiple sinusoidal components with low
distortion while avoiding many of the costs and restrictions associated with prior
techniques. Embodiments of the present invention are particularly advantageous in
situations where an efficient amplifier is needed. These results are obtained in an
illustrative embodiment of the present invention which comprises a main amplifier
and a pair of correction amplifiers, each of which eliminate different distortion
products introduced by the main amplifier into the amplified signal.FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of an
amplifier:FIG. 2 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the
present invention; andFIG. 3 depicts a schematic diagram of an illustrative phase-shifter as
shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2.FIG. 2 depicts a schematic diagram of an illustrative
embodiment of the present invention which receives and
amplifies an input signal and is particularly advantageous
in situations where high power, low distortion amplification
is desired. An illustrative embodiment of an amplifier
will, however, first be described with reference to
FIG. 1.The illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 1 advantageously comprises:
