<ABSTRACT>
In order to conserve in a sterile manner a liquid or semi-liquid product in an aseptic container or bottle (1) comprising a movable inner plunger (4), non-return means are, on the one hand, provided which act between the plunger (4) and the side wall of the body of the container and hold the plunger, after the force exerted in order to expel the blocked product has ceased, in the position reached, so as permanently to create a residual overpressure in the liquid product which is sufficient to prevent the germs and bacteria present in the ambient air from penetrating inside the product and contaminating it and, on the other hand, a movable plunger flap (13) is provided, which flap is actuated by the means (17) acting on the plunger, in order to cut off the emergent jet after the last drop, thus preventing any contact between the liquid and the air, so as to provide an additional guarantee of sterility with respect to spillage.

Process for conserving, in sterile manner, a liquid or 
semi-liquid product in an aseptic recipient or bottle (1) 

comprising a body with cylindrical or prismatic lateral wall, 
obturated at one end by a bottom (3), comprising an inner 

mobile piston (4) rubbing tightly against the inner surface of 

the lateral wall of the recipient (1) and defining a volume 
containing the product (2), this volume communicating with an 

outlet tube (6) terminating at an outlet orifice (7), an obturator 
device (8) comprising a mobile obturator flap (13) to 

close the outlet orifice (7), a manoeuvring knob (17) for 
exerting on the piston (4), upon each use, a sufficient force 

to push the piston (4) and consequently to exert on the product 
(2) a pressure ensuring that the desired quantity of product is 

delivered, the mobile obturator flap (13) being fast with a 
first arm (14a) of a two-arm lever (14), articulated about a 

horizontal pin (15) borne by an upper lid (31) of the recipient 
(1), the manoeuvring knob (17) being fast with the second arm 

(14b) of the lever (14), opposite the first arm (14a), and the 
two-arm lever (14) and the manoeuvring knob (17) being returned 

into normal position of closure by a spring (18), non-return 
means acting between the piston (4) and the lateral wall of the 

body and, after the force exerted to deliver the product has 
ceased, maintaining the blocked piston (11) in the position 

attained, characterized in that, thanks to the mobile piston 
(4) which is fast with an upwardly extending rod (28), this 

piston rod (28) presenting, on its outer lateral surface, a 
succession of upwardly directed notches or a thread, and thanks 

to the manoeuvring knob (17) which is mounted mobile on the 
upper lid (31) of the recipient, and which comprises at least 

one elastic element (36) which, when the knob (17) is driven 
in, abuts on notches (29) of the rod (28) in order to provoke a 

displacement of this rod of the piston (4) in the direction of 
the lower bottom (3) of the recipient, a residual pressure is  

 
permanently created in the liquid product, which is sufficient 

to prevent the germs and bacteria present in the surrounding 
air from penetrating inside the product and from contaminating 

it and, by means of the mobile obturator flap (13), the outlet 
jet is cut before the last drop, thus avoiding any contact of 

the liquid with the air so as to ensure a supplementary 
guarantee of sterile pouring. 
Aseptic recipient or bottle (1) for conserving a liquid or 
semi-liquid product, comprising a body with cylindrical or 

prismatic lateral wall, obturated at one end by a bottom (3), 
comprising an inner mobile piston (4) rubbing tightly against 

the inner surface of the lateral wall of the recipient (1) and 
defining a volume containing the product (2), this volume 

communicating with an outlet tube (6) terminating at an outlet 
orifice (7), an obturator device (8) comprising a mobile 

obturator flap (13) to close the outlet orifice (7), a 
manoeuvring knob (17) for exerting on the piston (4), upon each 

use, a sufficient force to push the piston (4) and consequently 
to exert on the product (2) a pressure ensuring that the 

desired quantity of product is delivered, the mobile obturator 
flap (13) being fast with a first arm (14a) of a two-arm lever 

(14), articulated about a horizontal pin (15) borne by an upper 
lid (31) of the recipient (1), the manoeuvring knob (17) being 

fast with the second arm (14b) of the lever (14), opposite the 
first arm (14a), and the two-arm lever (14) and the manoeuvring 

knob (17) being returned into normal position of closure by a 
spring (18), non-return means acting between the piston (4) and 

the lateral wall of the body and, after the force exerted to 
deliver the product has ceased, maintaining the blocked piston 

in the position attained, characterized in that the mobile 
piston (4) is fast with an upwardly extending rod (28), this 

piston rod (28) presenting, on its outer lateral surface, a 
succession of upwardly directed notches (29) or a thread, and 

the manoeuvring knob (17) which is mounted mobile on the upper 
lid (31) of the recipient comprises at least one elastic  

 
element (36) which, when the knob (17) is driven in, abuts on 

notches (29) of the rod (28) in order to provoke a displacement 
of this rod of the piston (4) in the direction of the lower 

bottom (3) of the recipient, so as, on the one hand, permanently 
to create a residual pressure in the liquid product 

sufficient to prevent the germs and bacteria present in the 
surrounding air from penetrating inside the product and from 

contaminating it, and, on the other hand, by means of the 
obturator flap (13) sliding across the outlet orifice (7), to 

cut the outlet jet of the liquid before the last drop, thus 
avoiding any contact of the liquid with the air and therefore 

ensuring a supplementary guarantee of sterile pouring. 
Recipient according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
piston (4) is traversed by a vertical immersion tube (27), the 

upper part of this immersion tube (27) serves as member for 
guiding the rod (28) which is pierced axially and traversed by 

the tube (27), this tube (27) is fast with the upper lid (31) 
and it is upwardly extended by a conduit (32) formed in a 

connecting piece (33) borne by the upper lid (31), whose end 
constitutes the outlet orifice (7), which is obturated by the 

flap (13) which presents, opposite the orifice (7), a slight 
boss (34) engaging in this orifice to close it, and the inner 

wall of the flap (13) rubs on the outer wall of the connecting 
piece (33) at the moment of opening, so as to be permanently 

protected from the air, the obturator flap (13) forms one piece 
with the arm (14a) of the two-arm lever (14) articulated about 

the horizontal pin (15) which is borne by the connecting piece 
(33), the other arm (14b) of the lever (14) forms, at its end, 

the manoeuvring knob (17) and it is extended downwardly by a 
tab (36) which traverses the lid (31), this tab (36) presenting, 

at its lower end, one or more teeth (39) intended to 
act on the notches (29) of the rod (28).
