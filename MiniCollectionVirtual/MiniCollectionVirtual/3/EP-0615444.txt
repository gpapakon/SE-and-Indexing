<ABSTRACT>
A peroral administration form for peptidic medicaments contains the peptidic medicament, in particular insulin, distributed in a gelatine or gelatine derivate matrix, besides usual pharmaceutical excipients and additives. By selecting an appropriate gelatine, the medicament is released in the small or large intestine, so that it is no longer enzymatically decomposed by peptidases.

Oral administration form for peptide medicaments, 
containing at least one peptide pharmaceutical substance 

in a matrix of gelatin, fractionated gelatin, collagen 
hydrolysate or a gelatin derivative which dissolves under 

physiological conditions, in addition to pharmaceutically 
customary excipients and auxiliaries, the peptide 

pharmaceutical substance(s) present in colloidal or 
dissolved form possessing a charge and the molecules of 

the matrix-forming agent possessing an opposite charge.

a rapidly dissolving form. 
Administration form according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that from the outside the first layer or 

the coat contains a depot form, while the second layer or 
the core contains an immediate-effect form. 
Process for the production of an oral administration 
form for peptide medicaments according to Claim 

1, characterized in that 

a) a gelatin, fractionated gelatin, collagen 
hydrolysate or a gelatin derivative is selected 

according to its isoelectric point (IEP) such that 
its IEP is matched with the charge state of the 

pharmaceutical substance particles such that the 
gelatin or its derivative leads to charge neutrality 

with the undissolved pharmaceutical substance at a 
specific pH, 
b) the gelatin or its derivative is converted into the 
agueous sol form, 
c) the pH is adjusted as a function of the IEP of the 
gelatin to such a value that the nanoparticles of 

the pharmaceutical substance forming are almost or 
completely stabilized in a neutrally charged manner, 

and 
d) before or after stage c), the pharmaceutical substance 
is dissolved in the aqueous gelatin sol or a 

solution of the pharmaceutical substance is combined 
with the aqueous gelatin sol. 
Process for the production of a slowly dissolving 
oral administration form for peptide medicaments 

according to Claim 1, characterized in that 

a) a gelatin, fractionated gelatin or its derivative 
with a maximum in the molecular weight distribution 

in the range from 9.5 x 10⁴ - 10⁶ D is selected, 
which is free from foreign ions, 
b) the gelatin is converted into the sol form with  
 

water at a temperature above 37°C and below the 
inactivation temperature of the peptide, 
c) the pH of the sol is adjusted to a value between 
that of the IEP of the gelatin and that of the 

peptide, 
d) the peptide is added in dissolved or undissolved 
form to the gelatin sol and optionally dissolved in 

the gelating sol, 
e) the water is removed, 
f) the powder obtained is pressed to give the administration 
form by customary processes and 
g) optionally the shaped article is coated with a film-forming 
agent. 
Process for the production of an oral administration 
form for peptide medicaments according to Claim 

1, characterized in that a powdered 
gelatin/pharmaceutical substance mixture is prepared with 

a gelatin, fractionated gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate 
or a gelatin derivative, which dissolve in physiological 

medium under physiological conditions, and the mixture is 
compressed. 
Process according to Claim 12 for the production 
of a time-controlled slowly and rapidly dissolving 

administration form, characterized in that the stages a) 
to e) are carried out with a second gelatin, a gelatin 

derivative or collagen hydrolysate for the rapidly 
dissolving administration form which contains a maximum 

in the molecular weight distribution below 10⁵, and in 
stage f) the two powders obtained are pressed to give 

two-layer or layered tablets, 
Process according to one of Claims 11-14, 
characterized in that gelatin of type B or A is employed 

independently of charge. 
Process according to one of Claims 11-14, 
characterized in that gelatin having a content of 

microgel of greater than 10% by weight is employed.
