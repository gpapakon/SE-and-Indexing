<ABSTRACT>
An optical source (11) emits a source optical signal (12) having a source optical signal power and a wavelength. A splitter (14) or other similar device splits the source optical signal into a first optical signal (15) having a first optical signal power and into a second optical signal (17) having a second optical signal power such that the source optical signal power is split between the first optical signal power and the second optical signal power. This split is dependent upon the wavelength of the source optical signal (11). A first detector (21) detects the first optical signal power and a second detector (22) detects the second optical signal power. A controller (25) responds to the first (21) and second (22) detectors in order to control the wavelength of the source optical signal (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
stabilization of the wavelength of an optical signal 
emitted by an optical source such as a laser. Optical sources, particularly broadband optical 
sources such as semiconductor light sources, are used in a 
variety of applications in which a stable wavelength of the 
emitted optical signal is important. For example, in ring 
laser and fiber optic gyroscope systems, a light source 
emits a light beam which is split. The resulting two light 
beams are then supplied to respective ends of an optical 
path. The two beams counterpropagate along the optical 
path, are recombined at the beam splitter and are received 
by a detection system for detecting the phase difference 
between the two counterpropagating light beams. If the 
gyroscope is at rest, the path length around the optical 
path is ideally the same for both light beams so that no 
phase difference between the two light beams will be 
detected. However, as the gyroscope rotates, the time that 
is required for one beam to travel the path is different 
than the time that is required for the other beam to 
traverse the path. In effect, one of the beams will travel 
a longer path than the other beam. Since the phases of the 
two beams are a function of the time required to travel 
their respective paths, any difference in that time between 
the two light beams will result in a phase difference.  
 Rotation of the gyroscope does not affect the 
frequency (i.e. wavelength) of the optical signal. 
However, environmental changes, such as temperature 
changes, can influence the wavelength of the signal 
supplied to the gyroscope by the optical source. Since the 
phase difference (i.e. phase shift) between the 
counterpropagating light beams is dependent upon wavelength 
as well as rotation, a constant wavelength is necessary so 
that the relationship between rotation and phase difference 
is repeatable from measurement to measurement. Therefore, 
it is important to minimize the effects of these 
environmental changes on the wavelength of the source 
optical signal so that any changes in phase of the output 
optical signals is due to rotation and not to changes in 
environmental conditions. EP-A 0 415 407 describes the frequency stabilization of a laser beam by using a birefringent 
body. For supplying a frequency control signal to a laser diode for generating a laser beam 
susceptible to a variation in frequency or wavelength, a frequency-stabilizing device 
comprising a birefringent body is used for converting the
