<ABSTRACT>
For producing lightweight cores (1) which comprise a plurality of material layers (2) bonded to one another along parallel, evenly distributed strip regions (3) and forming cavities (4) between the bonding regions, the material layers (2) are piled one on top of the other, bonded and, if appropriate, impregnated, and after curing are cut to size. To achieve core production which is particularly efficient, webs of laminated material (5) of a width adapted to the height of the cores (1) to be produced are prepared and are brought together in sheet-like form in a number corresponding to the material layers (2) of the cores (1) for building up a composite strip (6), whereupon the composite strip (6) produced is continuously aligned, treated under pressure and/or heat, impregnated, cured, stretched out, provided with outer layers (28), cropped or the like and then cut into lengths in treatment stations (14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) arranged one behind the other.
