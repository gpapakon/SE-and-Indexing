Set for the treatment of vascular deformities, comprising a clamp
(21) formed from body-compatible material, which clamp immobilises the

deformity and is attachable to the deformity by means of splayed portions,
and a positioning tool, comprising a tubular probe (12), which is

displaceable in a handle (11) in the axial direction by means of a control
member (111), and a positioning rod (13) extending through the tubular

probe (12) and terminating in a gripping device (131), which is attachable
to the clamp (21), in the form of claws (131'...), which are splayed out of

engagement with the tubular probe (12) and displaced towards one another
enclosed by the tubular probe (12), said claws becoming effective on the

clamp (21), and said positioning rod being mounted in the handle,
characterised in that the clamp (21), which is made from titanium, is

formed from two semicircular profile rods (21', 21''), which are splayed in
the unloaded condition and assembled at the bottom ends (211) in a socket

(22) forming corners (221) on the periphery, in front of which socket is
situated a clamping ring (23), which encloses the rods (21', 21'') and is

displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the clamp (21) via an arched
portion (213) of the semicircular profile rods (21', 21''), said clamping ring

being traversed by a mandrel (231) protruding on both sides beyond the
semicircular profile rods (21', 21'') of the clamp (21), and the bend-resistant

tubular probe (12), which is displaceable in the handle (11) of the
positioning tool in the axial direction relative to the handle (11) and is

mounted in the handle (11) so as to be rotatable about its longitudinal axis,
is provided with the positioning rod (13), which extends therein and is

positionally secured relative to the handle (11) in the axial direction, and
said probe has, at its front end, a receiving means (121) for the mandrel 

(231), which traverses the clamping ring (23) forming a component part of
the clamp (21), in the form of a bayonet-type securing means.
Set according to claim 1, characterised by a handle (11) in the form
of a pistol body with a gripping stock (116) and a control member (111)

for the tubular probe (12) in the form of a trigger guard.
Set according to claim 2, characterised in that the tubular probe (12)
is provided with an annular shoulder (121), which is enclosed by the fork-shaped

end of the trigger guard (111).
Set according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that tubular
probe (12) and positioning rod (13) are mounted together so as to be

securable relative to the handle (11) and rotatable about its longitudinal
axis.
Set according to claim 4, characterised by a resilient locking
arrangement (134, 136) for the tubular probe (12) relative to the handle

(11).
Set according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
handle (11) has a recess (112) exposing the tubular probe (12), and a

control member (123) is associated with the tubular probe (12) in the
region of this recess (112) for rotating the tubular probe (12) relative to the

positioning rod (13). 
Set according to claim 6, characterised by a knurled ring, which is
associated with the tubular probe (12) and serves as the control member.
Set according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by a securable
hand grip (116) displaceable in the longitudinal direction relative to the

bearing shells (113), which enclose the tubular probe (12) and are
assembled by screw connections or the like.
