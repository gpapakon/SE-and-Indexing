<ABSTRACT>
Recording apparatus for recording video signal on 
a tape by helical scan heads has a special frame data detector 

(4) for detecting a special frame data that can be processed 
during a reproducing operation, without any additional data, 

to reproduce an image, a memory (5) for storing the special 
frame data, and inserting arrangement (7, SW2, 101) for 

inserting a selected track after a predetermined number of 
tracks. One selected track is written with a portion of the 

special frame data repeatedly, and another selected track is 
written with another portion of the special frame data 

repeatedly, and so on. During the high speed reproducing 
mode, various portions of the special frame data as obtained 

from a number of selected tracks are gathered to form an 
image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helical scan-type
recording and/or reproducing apparatus for recording and/or
reproducing large volumes of data such as digital video
signals, and relates particularly to a video cassette recorder
or other recording and/or reproducing apparatus capable during
data reproduction of reproducing data at a reproducing speed
different from that used during normal data reproduction.EP-A-0 505 985 representing the closest prior art from which the invention
proceeds discloses a high efficiency coding recording and reproducing apparatus
comprising a coding controlling circuit, a sub-code making circuit, a reproducing
speed designating circuit and an output type changing circuit. The coding
controlling circuit time-divisionally multiplexes the intra-picture coded, forward
predictively coded or bidirectionally predictively coded data. In the intra-picture
coded data among them, a process flag showing the intra-picture coded data is
described by the sub-code making circuit. At the time of the reproduction, when
the process flag is detected, the reproducing speed designating circuit adjusts the
reproducing speed and at least only the intra-picture coded data is positively
reproduced. The intra-picture coded data can be decoded by only the data of one
frame. Also, at the time of the special reproduction, the reproduced data are able
to be decoded. Further, the output type changing circuit outputs the reproduced
decoded data at a fixed period corresponding to the designated speed multiplying
number and a natural special reproduced picture is obtained.EP-A-0 596 527, which is a prior art pursuant to Article 54 (3) and (4) EPC with
respect to the same countries as designated for the present patent, discloses a
data recording apparatus wherein digital data representing a compressed image are
separated into priority data and normal data, and formatted so that the priority data
are repeatedly recorded on a magnetic tape. The transmission rate of the digital
data is compared with the recording rate on the magnetic tape to control the
number of repetitions of the priority data. The recording and reproducing method described in
JP-A-2-094071 is one
known method used for special reproducing modes in conventional
digital recording video cassette recorders (VCRs). In this
method, still image data extracted from the video signal for
use during high speed reproduction is recorded to a specific
tracing pattern across plural tracks. The tracing pattern of
this method is compatible with only one
