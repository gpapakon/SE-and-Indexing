<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the composition, 
preparation and use of multi-layer composite films comprising 

a core layer of low gas permeable material, two intermediate 
layers sandwiching the core layer and two outer layers 

sandwiching the two intermediate layers. The core layer 
provides an excellent oxygen barrier property, whereas the 

intermediate and outer layers protect the core layer so the 
oxygen permeability of the resulting multi-layer composite 

film becomes independent of relative humidity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-layer composite 
films for applications requiring low oxygen permeability. Packages allowing significant penetration of 
oxygen or other gases are undesirable where gas transmission 
contributes to the degradation or decay of the packaged 
product. For example, the development of packages having 
low oxygen transmission rates, i.e., high oxygen barrier 
properties, has long been a desirable objective in the food 
packaging industry, because low gas permeability food 
packages increase the shelf life of the packaged food 
products. The film of the present invention can be used in 
any food package, and may also be used on the interior or 
exterior of a food packaging having a plastic or cardboard 
structural layer. Packages having low oxygen transmission 
rates also have utility for packaging other oxygen sensitive 
materials, such as oxygen activated sealants. Longer shelf 
life of the product increases inventory efficiency for 
distributors and reduces the likelihood that the consumer 
will accidently purchase and use a contaminated or 
unsatisfactory product. For a plastic film to be qualified for food 
packaging applications, the film, has to have low oxygen 
permeability not only at low relative humidity, but also at 
high relative humidity since the packed food may be stored 
in either environment. Unfortunately, most of the 
commercially available plastic film cannot meet these two 
requirements simultaneously. For example, polyvinylalcohol 
has very low oxygen permeability at 0% relative humidity but 
high oxygen permeability when the relative humidity exceeds 
70%. On the other hand, the oxygen permeability of 
polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene are 
independent of relative humidity, but have oxygen 
permeability which is too high for food packaging 
applications. The ideal film will have both low oxygen  
 
permeability and insensitivity to relative humidity. The present invention solves these problems by 
providing the art with a multi-layer composite of silicone 
treated plastic film that exhibits excellent low gas 
transmission characteristics at both 0% and 85% relative 
humidity. The resulting films are transparent, flexible 
and creasable and will not crack when bent and may be 
mounted on to the interior or exterior of a food package 
having a cardboard or plastic structural layer. The present invention discloses a composition and 
a method of preparation of multi-layer composite films 
comprising a core layer of very low gas transmission
