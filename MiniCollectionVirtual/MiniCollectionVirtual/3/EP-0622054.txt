<ABSTRACT>
The dental syringe comprises a tubular body (2) 
housing a selection and supply unit (3) of water 

and air to a spout (4), and a rigid tubular 
element (7) detachably constrainable coaxially and 

externally to the selection and supply unit (3) 
and provided with an aperture (11) to connect the 

controls (5) of the selection and supply unit (3) 
to the selection and supply unit (3). The rigid 

tubular element (7) fits inside a tubular glove 
(8), made in an elastic material and in a single 

body with the controls (5) such as to create an 
easily-sterilizable continuous external surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dental syringe, of the 
type used by dentists to clean or dry a zone of 
the oral cavity he or she intends to operate in, 
where a fluid for cleaning or drying comprises 
water or air or a nebulized mixture of the two. The syringe is usually composed of a handpiece 
with a tubular body housing a unit or group 
constituting the mechanical, hydraulic or 
electrical component for supplying the water or 
air. At a front end of the tubular body is a spout 
delivering the fluid, which is connected to the 
supply unit and which is detachable for 
sterilizing or substitution purposes, while a 
traditional socket connection is situated at a 
posterior end, for connecting up to pressurised 
water and air supply pipes. The tubular body exhibits at least two apertures 
on the handpiece for command controls or levers. The controls, either directly or through connected 
lever mechanisms in the supply unit comprising 
intercept valves, enable a selection of the  
 
delivery fluid or fluid mix to be made and 
regulated. This handpiece arrangement, however, 
has in recent times become unsuitable to ever-stricter 
hygiene norms in the field, especially 
with regard to their sterilization, which is at 
present done in sterilization chambers. The chief drawback lies in the fact that the 
handpiece exhibits numerous interstitial spaces 
and apertures, with the result that the handpiece 
is not completely closed and in order to achieve a 
full sterilization it would strictly also be 
necessary to sterilize the supply unit. The result 
is a build-up of bacteria in the above-mentioned 
spaces and apertures and a gradual increase in 
malfunctions of the unit due to continual 
sterilization procedures, which are not well-suited 
to the delicate structural components 
inside the unit. A solution to the above problem has been to cover 
the internal supply unit with a rigid and sealed 
external tubular body, with the controls being 
activated from outside the external body, said 
external body affording an aperture at a position 
coinciding with said controls. The controls are 
covered by a strip of shaped elastic material  
 
perfectly meeting edges of the rigid body 
aperture, and are activated by user pressure on 
the elastic strips. The above solution, however, still exhibits 
drawbacks with regard to hygiene, since 
interstitial spaces, now between the elastic 
material and the rigid body, are not totally 
eliminated, and can become clogged with infectious 
bacteria liable to pass through to the

<CLAIMS>
A dental syringe comprising a central handgrip (1) 
constituted by: 


a tubular body (2) housing a selection and 
supply unit (3) of water and air; 
a spout (4) detachably connected to the 
selection and supply unit (3) at a front end of 

the tubular body (2), which receives water and air 
from the supply unit (3); 
controls (5) provided on said body (2) for 
activating a supply of water and air to the supply 

unit (3); 
 
a socket (6) connected to the selection and supply 

unit (3), said socket (6) being equipped with 
supply pipes (6, 6b) of the water and air to the 

selection and supply unit (3), 
characterised in that the tubular body (2) 

comprises a rigid tubular element (7) externally 
and detachably constrainable to the selection and 

supply unit (3) and equipped with at least one 
aperture (11) connecting the controls (5) and the 

selection and supply unit (3), said rigid tubular 
element (7) supporting an external tubular glove 

 
(8) made of an elastic material and in a single 

body with the controls (5) such as to define a 
continuous external surface of the handpiece. 
A syringe as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
tubular glove (8) exhibits a series of radial 

projections (9) on an internal surface of the 
glove (8), which projections (9) are couplable to 

holes (10) provided in the rigid tubular element 
(7) on an external surface of said rigid tubular 

element (7), such as to permit of axially and 
rotationally constraining the rigid tubular 

element (7) inside the tubular glove (8). 
A syringe as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
controls (5) are constituted by a pair of raised 

zones (12) exhibited on an external surface of the 
tubular glove (8), and forming a Y-shape.
