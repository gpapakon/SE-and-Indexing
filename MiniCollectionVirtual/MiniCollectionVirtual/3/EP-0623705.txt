<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a fastener assembly for 
fastening railway rails to a railway sleeper, in which co-operating 

means, such as a projecting peg or lug (14) and a 
series of ramps (20), are located on a securing screw (10) 

and a base member (16), such as a baseplate, respectively. 
The co-operating means (14, 20) interact when the screw (10) 

is tightened, to limit the torque applied to the screw (10) 
and so prevent thread damage through overtightening. The 

ramps (20) may be incorporated into existing as well as 
newly manufactured railway baseplates (16), and the co-operating 

means (14,20) come into engagement to prevent 
further tightening of the screw (10) when spring means 

(25,25a,33,37,57,101 or 115) are deformed as a result of 
initial tightening of the screw (10). The spring means may 

be in the form of a resiliently deformable washer 
(25,25a,33,37) of plastic or a bell washer (115), or formed 

of spring steel (57 or 101).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fastener assemblies, in
particular fastener assemblies employing threaded, large
headed screws by means of which railway rails or railway
chairs or baseplates are fastened to railway sleepers.In a large number of countries, many railway sleepers
are made from wood, or concrete with wooden or plastic
inserts. Fixings such as baseplates are then fastened to
the sleepers by means of screws which are inserted into a
narrow bore made in the wood or plastic and tightened
mechanically or manually so that a thread to receive the
screw forms in the wooden or plastic bore. In other
constructions, a fastening clip is used to hold the rail on
a baseplate, using a screw which engages within the sleeper.Because the screw is usually secured in place in a
sleeper with a large wrench, power impact wrench or driver,
applying substantial torque, the screw is liable to be
overtightened. This can lead to thread damage, and in
extreme cases stripping of the thread formed in the sleeper
so that pull-out strength is greatly diminished.The usual solution to this problem is to use
specialised equipment to pre-set and limit the torque to be
applied to the screw. However, the technology is only as
good as the condition of the equipment and the quality of
labour which is not always assured.BE-A-549987 discloses a method of fitting screws into
"artificial" wooden panels e.g. sheets of chipboard made of
compressed wood shavings, such as are used in the
manufacture of furniture, wherein the chamfered head of the
screw and a co-operating countersink hole in a hinge, washer
or the like to be connected to the panel, are provided with
inter engaging teeth to prevent the screw from being screwed
down too far into the panel, which is relatively soft, and
thus, easily damaged. In the method disclosed, where the
co-operating teeth interengage, which happens suddenly, it 
is impossible to turn the screw any further, and thus the
screw cannot damage the chipboard panel.This method suffers from the disadvantage that there
is a predetermined limit governing the amount by which the
screw can be inserted, and such a system would be wholly
unsuited for use in connecting railway rails to railway
sleepers.According to the present invention, there is provided
a fastener assembly for fastening a railway rail to a
railway sleeper, comprising a screw and a base member, each
of which is provided with co-operating means, and spring
means which is deformable by rotation of the screw into the
sleeper to allow the co-operating means

<CLAIMS>
A fastener assembly for fastening a railway rail to
a railway sleeper, comprising a screw (10) and a base member

(16), characterised in that the screw (10) and base member
(16) are provided with co-operating means (14,20) and

including spring means (25,57 or 101) which is deformable by
rotation of the screw (10) into the sleeper to allow the co-operating

means (14,20) to move into interlocking engagement
with each other, either directly or via an intermediate

member (57 or 101), to prevent further rotation of the screw
(10).
An assembly according to claim 1 in which the screw
(10) comprises a head portion (11) and a threaded shank (12)

for engaging a bore in the railway sleeper and the base
member (16) has an aperture (17) through which the threaded

shank (12) of the screw (10) passes, there being at least
one depending lug (14) on the underside of the head portion

(11) forming the co-operating means on said screw (10).
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, in which the
co-operating means (20) provided on the base member

comprises a plurality of ramps (20) separated by steps (22)
which are disposed around the aperture (17) in the base

member (16) through which the screw (10) passes, the steps
(22) between the ramps (20) and co-operating means (14) on

the screw progressively moving into co-operating engagement
to resist the turning motion of the screw (10) as the screw

(10) is tightened and the spring means (25) is deformed.
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3 in which the
spring means comprises a washer (25) made of compressible

resilient plastic.
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, in which
the spring means comprises a distorted helical spring (57)

provided with end faces (61,62) which move apart as the 
spring (57) is compressed, to contact the screw co-operating

means (14) and the baseplate co-operating means (20)
respectively.
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the
spring means comprises a deformable washer (101) formed of

two back-to-back deformed annular discs, each of which has
a shallow U-shape when viewed from one edge, with the convex

faces of the discs (101,103) in abutting relationship just
at the base of the U-shape, there being abutments

(109,111,113,115) on each concave face of the discs
(101,103) which form co-operating means for engaging with

the co-operating means (14) on the screw (10) and the co-operating
means (20) on the base member.
An assembly according to any one of claims 1-6 in
which the co-operating means (20) on the base member are

cast, forged, moulded or stamped into a base plate (16) for
the railway rail.
An assembly according to any one of claims 1-6 in
which the co-operating means on the base member are formed

in a separate steel plate or washer for securing to a

baseplate for the railway rail.
