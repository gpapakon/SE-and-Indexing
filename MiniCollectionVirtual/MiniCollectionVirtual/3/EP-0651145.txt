<ABSTRACT>
System for cooling gas turbine inlet air using turbine combustion 
fuel (e.g. liquid natural gas) comprising a heat exchanger (4) for 

exchanging heat between the relatively cold fuel (2) and a first heat 
exchange medium (7), such as brine, via an intermediate heat exchange 

medium (5,6) such as propane. The system also contains a heat 
accumulator (8) for heat exchange between the relatively cold first heat 

exchange medium (7) and a second heat exchange medium 
(9) such as water in 

order that said second heat exchange medium (9) can accumulate chilling 
properties and, upon demand, trans
fer these properties to a turbine 
inlet air cooler (10), thus cooling said inlet air (13) by heat exchange 

with said second heat exchange medium (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
apparatus for cooling gas turbine
intake air using fuel for driving the gas turbine such as
liquified natural gas (hereunder, referred to as LNG) and
to a method of cooling intake air for a gas turbine.Recently, combined power plants using gas turbines
have increased in use for power supply as compared
with conventional steam power plants because the former
is higher in efficiency than the latter.In gas turbines a large amount of
air is taken in by a rotary compressor and its output is
generated by expanding the air, so that the specific
gravity of the air greatly influences the output. The
higher the atmospheric temperature, the smaller
the specific gravity of the air becomes, and the gas turbine
has a characteristic that its output decreases as
well. On the other hand, since the peak of electric
power demand is in summer, power is required much
more in summer when the atmosphere temperature is high.
This is contrary to the characteristic of the gas
turbine. It is necessary to effectively supply electric
power without decreasing power generation of the gas
turbine even if the atmosphere temperature is high. According to such a demand, a gas turbine intake air
cooling method is proposed, wherein decrease in gas
turbine output in summer is prevented by lowering the gas
turbine intake air temperature below atmosphere
temperature and supplying the cooled intake air.
Japanese Utility-Model Publication No. 61-37794
discloses a method in which LNG cold lowers
temperature of brine as a heat medium, the brine is
brought into direct contact with gas turbine intake air
to lower the temperature thereof. Japanese Patent Laid-open
Application No. 1-142219 discloses a method in which
LNG cold lowers a temperature of a heat medium and the
heat medium lowered in temperature cools directly gas
turbine intake air or indirectly cools the gas turbine
intake air using another heat medium. In the laid-open
application, it is described that water or mixture of
ethylene glycol and water for instance is used the heat
mediums.In the former method above using the brine as a heat
medium directly contacting with LNG cold, the brine is
liable to be easily frozen because of a temperature difference
between a boiling temperature -162°C of LNG and a
solidifying point -22°C of the brine, which is a bar to
recirculation of the brine. The latter method above
also has a similar problem.Further, since the peak of power demand is in
summer, particularly in the daytime of summer, it is
desirable to cool gas
