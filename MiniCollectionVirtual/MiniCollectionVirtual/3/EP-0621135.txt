<ABSTRACT>
A pressure wave pulse having a maximum pressure P1 
and a width T generated from a piezoelectric element (201) moves 

in a longitudinal direction. A pressure wave pulse having 
a maximum pressure Q and a width T generated from another 

piezoelectric element (204) moves in any opposite direction. 
When the two pressure wave pulses overlap each other, a 

synthetic wave having a magnitude P and a width T is 
generated to thereby jet ink from a nozzle (152). At this time, 

a pressure having a magnitude greater than the magnitude P 
is temporarily applied several times to nozzles adjacent 

to the nozzle. However, a duration of the pressure 
applied is not enough to jet the ink from the adjacent 

nozzles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink jet apparatus. As a printer head, there has conventionally been 
proposed a drop-on-demand type of ink jet printer head 
using piezoelectric ceramics. In this type of ink jet 
printer head, the volume of an ink chamber is changed by 
deforming the piezoelectric ceramics. When the volume is 
decreased, ink contained in the ink chamber is expelled in 
the form of droplets from a nozzle, whereas when the 
volume is increased, additional ink is introduced from an 
ink supply passage into the ink chamber. A plurality of 
such nozzles are arranged in neighboring relationship to 
each other, and the ink droplets are expelled from desired 
ones of the nozzles according to desired print data to 
thereby form desired characters or images on a sheet of 
paper or the like opposed to the nozzles. This kind of ink jet apparatus is disclosed in 
U.S. Patents Nos. 4,879,568; 4,887,100; 4,992,808; and 
5,003,679; U.S. Patent No. 5,028,936 (corresponding to 
Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. Sho 63-247051 and 
63-252750); and U.S. Patent No. 5,016,028 (corresponding 
to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 2-150355), for 
example. Figs. 15 to 19 schematically show such a 
conventional ink jet apparatus. The structure of such a conventional ink jet 
apparatus will now be described with reference to Fig. 15 
which shows a cross section thereof. Reference numeral 1 
denotes a piezoelectric ceramics plate having a plurality 
of grooves 15 and side walls 11 partitioning these grooves 
15 and polarized in a direction depicted by an arrow 4. 
Reference numeral 2 denotes a cover plate formed of a one 
of several materials, such as ceramics and resins. The 
piezoelectric ceramics plate 1 and the cover plate 2 are 
bonded together by an adhesive layer 3 formed of an epoxy 
adhesive, for example, whereby the plural grooves 15 are  
 
formed as a plurality of ink chambers 12 spaced from each 
other in a transverse direction of the piezoelectric 
ceramics plate 1. Each ink chamber 12 is rectangular in 
cross section and is elongated over the length of the 
piezoelectric ceramics plate 1. Each side wall 11 extends 
over the length of the ink chamber 12 it defines. The 
adhesive layer 3 is formed on the upper surface of each 
side wall 11. A pair of metal electrodes 13, for applying 
a driving electric field, are formed on the opposed side 
surfaces of each ink chamber 12 at an upper half portion 
thereof. All of the ink chambers 12 are filled with ink. The operation of the ink jet apparatus shown in 
Fig. 15
