<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electron source 
and an image-forming apparatus realized by using the 
same and, more particularly, it relates to an 
electron source comprising a plurality of surface 
conduction electron emitting devices and an image-forming 
apparatus realized by using the same. Thermoelectron sources and cold cathode 
electron sources are known two types of electron 
emitting devices. Electron emitting devices that can 
be used for cold cathode electron sources include 
those of field emission type (hereinafter referred to 
as FE type), metal/insulation layer/metal type 
(hereinafter referred to as MIN type) and surface 
conduction type. Examples of FE type devices are proposed in 
W. P. Dyke & W. W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advance 
in Electron Physics, 8, 89 (1956), A. Spindt, 
"PHYSICAL Properties of thin-film field emission 
cathode with molybdenum cones", J. Appln. Phys., 47, 
5248 (1976). An MIN type device is disclosed in C. 
A. Mead, "The tunnel emission amplifier", J. Appln. 
Phys., 32, 646 (1961). A surface conduction  
 
electron-emitting device is proposed in M. I. 
Elinson, Radio Eng. Electron Phys., 10 (1965). A surface conduction electron-emitting device 
is realized by utilizing the phenomenon that 
electrons are emitted out of a small thin film formed 
on a substrate when an electric current is forced to 
flow in parallel with the film surface. While 
Elinson proposes the use of a SnO2 thin film for a 
device of this type, the use of an Au thin film is 
proposed in G. Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", 9, 317 
(1972), whereas the use of an In2O3/SnO2 Thin film 
and that of a carbon thin film are discussed 
respectively in M. Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad: "IEEE 
Trans. ED Conf.", 519 (1975) and H. Araki et al.: 
"vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22 (1983). An electron source having the features indicated in the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-523 702. Fig. 31 of the accompanying drawings 
schematically illustrates a typical surface 
conduction electron-emitting device proposed by M. 
Hartwell. In Fig. 31, reference numerals 311, 313 
and 314 respectively denote an insulator substrate, 
an electron-emitting region and a thin metal oxide 
film including said electron-emitting region, whereas 
reference numerals 315 and 316 denote device 
electrodes that is made of a material common with 
that of the thin film 314. Referring to Fig. 31, the 
thin metal oxide film has a length L1 of 0.5 to 1 mm 
and a width W of 0.1 mm. Note that the electron-emitting  
 
region 313 is only very
