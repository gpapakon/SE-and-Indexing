<ABSTRACT>
Bulk parts of high-temperature superconductor material comprise the oxides of bismuth, strontium, calcium and copper and the sulphates of strontium and/or barium. These bulk parts have an increased current-carrying capacity which is caused by a preferential orientation of the crystallites, with the crystallographic c axis being perpendicular to the temperature gradient during their solidification from the melt. These bulk parts are produced by casting a homogeneous melt of the oxides of bismuth, strontium, calcium and copper and the sulphates of strontium and/or barium at temperatures of from 900 to 1300 DEG C into moulds, allowing the melt to solidify slowly therein and subsequently igniting the bulk parts taken from the moulds at from 700 to 900 DEG C in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The homogeneous melt is cast into moulds having at least two parallel walls, which results in a preferential crystallographic orientation of the crystallites in the bulk parts both after their solidification and also after their ignition.
