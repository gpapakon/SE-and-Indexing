<ABSTRACT>
In a process for finding the reference moments in a rail vehicle in which each driven wheel is coupled to a motor, the average nM is found from the rotation speeds nR, nL of a left and right-hand running or driving wheel. This average controls the frequency and/or amplitude of a periodic signal which is superimposed on the predetermined reference torque MS directly on the one hand and after inversion on the other. One linked reference torque is then allocated to the right-hand MRS and the other to the left-hand drive motor MLS. This process makes it possible to achieve low and uniform rates of wear of the tread of the driving wheels of rail vehicles with individual-wheel drive. In addition, the noise level is kept to a minimum.

<CLAIMS>
Determination method for the torque attribution for a 
railway vehicle, each driven wheel being linked to a motor, 

characterized in that from the revolution speed (nR, nL) of a 
mobile wheel or a driving wheel, right and left side, the 

average value (nM) is calculated to control the frequency 
and/or the amplitude of a periodic signal that is superposed, 

on the one hand, directly and, on the other hand, after 
inversion, to the preset torque target value (Ms), a combined 

torque target value being associated to driving motors (MRS) 
situated of the right side and an other combined torque 

target value being associated to driving motors (MLS) 
situated of the left side. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the periodic signal waveform is sinuso√Ødal, triangular or 

rectangular. 
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the periodic signal superposed to the 

torque target value is suppressed while runing in curve, 
during an overstirring period and/or slipping or if the speed of 

the railway vehicle comes under a minimum value.
