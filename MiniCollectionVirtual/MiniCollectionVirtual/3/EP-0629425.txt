<ABSTRACT>
A belt filter device is proposed for purifying contaminated liquids. This belt filter device has an upper dirt chamber (13) receiving the contaminated liquid. Beneath this is arranged a clean chamber (22, 23). Between the dirt chamber and clean chamber is provided a filter plate (24, 25) furnished with a liquid throughway, on which filter plate is arranged a circulating filter belt (14) which can be automatically advanced in dependence on the amount of impurities deposited on it. Outside the dirt chamber is situated a cleaning apparatus (29) which removes the impurities situated on the filter belt. The cleaning device has at least one spray head (30) which is arranged on the rear of the filter cloth and above the surface of the contaminated liquid so that the dirty cleaning liquid is fed directly to the contaminated liquid.

Band filter arrangement for cleaning contaminated 
liquids, including an upper contaminated liquid chamber 

(12) for accommodating the contaminated liquid, a filtrate 
chamber (22, 23) disposed therebeneath and for 

accommodating the cleaned liquid, and a filter base (24, 
25) disposed therebetween and provided with 

through-apertures for liquid, on which base a circulatory 
filter band (14) is disposed so as to be automatically 

displaceable in dependence on the quantity of contaminated 
material deposited thereon, a cleaning arrangement (29) 

being provided externally of the contaminated liquid 
chamber (12), which arrangement lies inside the circulatory 

filter band (14) and removes the contaminated material 
situated on the filter band (14), and the cleaning 

arrangement (29) having at least one spray head (30, 31) 
disposed above the level of the contaminated liquid, 

characterised in that the spray head (30, 31) is orientated 
from below onto the rear side of the filter band (14), so 

that the contaminated liquid to be cleaned is supplied 
directly to the contaminated liquid (13), and a collecting 

trough (27) is provided for liquid being deflected from the 
rear side of the filter band (14), which trough conducts 

away the cleaning liquid into the filtrate chamber. 
Band filter arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that at least one nozzle is provided with 

a drive mechanism which executes an X-Y movement over the 
area to be cleaned, the filter band preferably being 

cleaned when the filter band is stationary. 
Band filter arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that an endless chain is 

provided, which conveys the circulatory endless filter 
band, lugs being provided to secure the filter band to the 

endless chain, and the filter band being fastenable in said  
 

lugs, and the lugs being provided so that the filter band 
is disposed in the neutral cross-section of the chain. 
Band filter arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the contaminated liquid chamber is 

sealed from the filtrate chamber by means of a sealing 
profile, which extends longitudinally of the contaminated 

liquid chamber, and pressure elements are provided which 
exert a force upon the sealing profile in the direction of 

the filter band. 
Band filter arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the contaminated 

liquid chamber has a substantially V-shaped configuration, 
and guide means are disposed in the lower region of the 

V-shaped chamber, the conveyor chain being supported on 
said means. 
Band filter arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a tensioning device 

for the conveyor chain and cloth is disposed above the 
level of the contaminated liquid in the region of the 

deflection. 
Band filter arrangement according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the tensioning device is combined 

with the guide means. 
Band filter arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that two nozzles are 

provided for cleaning the filter band, said nozzles being 
disposed adjacent each other and spraying a respective 

strip of the filter band, the two areas slightly 
overlapping each other. 
Band filter arrangement according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the two nozzles are disposed so as to  

 
be displaceable in the X direction and in the Y direction 

and are mounted on a circulatory chain, which is guided at 
the sides of the filter band via chain wheels.
