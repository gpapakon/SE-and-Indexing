<ABSTRACT>
In a computer system including a plurality of interlinked 
computers, the computers have respective video cameras 

associated therewith, whereby video pictures of a person 
associated with each computer can be transmitted to the other 

computers. Each computer maintains a database of records 
containing information concerning the other computers in the 

system. Each such record can contain data representing an 
image of a person associated with the relevant remote computer, 

captured from the video information transmitted from that 
computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a computer system including a plurality 
of interlinked computers. Modern telephones systems allow multiple parties at different 
locations to hold a conference. However, telephone conferences do 
not provide all of the conveniences of a face-to-face conference, 
where participants all meet at a common table in a meeting room. 
For example, in a meeting room, participants can view an object of 
interest, such as a drawings or a product. Such viewing is not 
possible in a telephone conference. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of 
operating a computer whereby a record can be maintained efficiently, 
of other computers with which the computer can communicate. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided 
a method of operating a computer, characterized by the steps of: 
establishing a database containing records of other computers with 
which said computer can communicate; and storing in said records 
data representing visual images of persons associated with the 
respective other computers. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described 
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which;- 
Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by telephone 
lines. Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in 
Figures 3-14. In the example, a calculator program is operated, and 
annotated, by various parties. Figure 3 illustrates how the system responds when a host user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 4 illustrates how the system responds when a host user  
 
attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 5 illustrates how the system responds when a host user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Application mode. Figure 6 illustrates how the system responds when a host user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode. Figure 7 illustrates how the system responds when a host user 
attempts to annotate the calculator, in Local Annotation mode.  Figure 8 illustrates how the system responds to a host user when 
in view mode. Figure 9 illustrates how the system responds when a remote user 
attempts to operate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 10 illustrates how the system responds when a remote 
user attempts to annotate the calculator, in Annotation mode. Figure 11 illustrates how the system responds when a remote 
user attempts to operate the calculator, in Application mode. Figure 12 illustrates how the system

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a computer characterized by the 
steps of: establishing a database containing records of other 

computers with which said computer can communicate; and 
storing in said records data representing visual images of 

persons associated with the respective other computers. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said step of storing includes the steps of: establishing a video 

connection with another computer; capturing a segment of 
incoming video data from said another computer; and storing the 

captured segment of video data in said database in association 
with other data relating to said another computer. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
database is a relational database. 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized by the steps of: translating the captured video data 

into a predetermined format; and scaling the video data to be 
accommodated in a memory space of predetermined size. 
A method according to claim 4, characterized by the 
steps of: storing a frame of received video data in a video 

memory; and copying at least part of the data stored in said 
video memory to a system memory of the computer, prior to 

said steps of translating and scaling. 
A computer system including at least two interlinked 
computers, each adapted to carry out a method according to 

any one of the preceding claims.
