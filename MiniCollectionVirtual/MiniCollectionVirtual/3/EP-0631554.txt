<ABSTRACT>
An aircraft propulsive power unit (19) comprises a nacelle structure (20) housing an engine and having a forward nacelle portion (21) and a rearward nacelle portion (131). The rearward end of the forward nacelle portion (21) in an operational position adjoins the forward end of the rearward nacelle portion (131) and the forward end of the forward nacelle portion (21) includes an intake opening leading to an intake barrel (28) upstream of the engine for the supply of intake air to the engine. The forward nacelle portion (21) has an uninterrupted or substantially uninterrupted low drag exterior surface thereover and the power unit includes support structure to support the forward nacelle portion (21) while permitting it to be moved forwardly on the support structure from the operational position to a forward position in which it is supported by the support structure forwardly of the operational position to provide access to components of the power unit (19) which are inaccessible with the forward nacelle portion (21) in the operational position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to propulsive power units 
for aircraft and is particularly although not exclusively 
concerned with a power unit comprising a ducted fan 
turbine (turbofan) engine and a nacelle which houses the 
engine. The function of the nacelle for a turbofan engine is 
generally twofold. Firstly, the nacelle must provide an 
air intake flow to the fan of minimal disturbance for a 
variety of flight conditions which include high 
incidence, gusts and the like. Secondly, the exterior 
profile of the nacelle should be such as to minimise 
aerodynamic drag, subject to constraints imposed by major 
engine components such as the accessories gearbox. Considering the exterior profile, the skin friction 
component of the overall profile drag is directly 
affected by the discontinuities on the outer surface. 
While the ideal would be for a smooth, uninterrupted 
outer surface, this ideal is compromised in nacelles 
hitherto proposed by the various breaks in the outer skin 
which arise due to the doors and panels required to gain 
access to the equipment housed within. A typical conventional nacelle is shown in Figure 1 of 
the drawings, which is a schematic perspective view of an 
underwing pylon mounted turbofan power unit. The main 
structural components of the nacelle are the inlet cowl 
11, the fan cowl doors 12, the thrust reverser unit 13 
and the nozzle 14. The inlet cowl 11 is a single unit, 
comprising a leading edge lipskin structure 15, an outer 
main skin 16, an air intake acoustic barrel 17 which 
serves to attenuate engine noise, and various internal  
 
stiffening members and bulkheads. The inlet cowl 11 
generally attaches, via a flange at the rear of the 
acoustic barrel 17, to a front flange of the engine fan 
case. The fan cowl doors 12 are generally hinged at the 
pylon 18, and are latched together at the bottom centre 
line. The thrust reverser unit 13 may take a variety of 
forms but is typically mounted on the pylon 18. The 
nozzle 14 may be attached in a variety of ways depending 
upon the exhaust philosophy adopted, i.e., mixed or 
separate fan stream exhaust and core exhaust. The forms 
which the thrust reverser and nozzle take only marginally 
affect the benefits derived from a propulsive power unit 
according to the present invention and as hereinafter to 
be described, as will become apparent. Aerodynamic research has demonstrated that on such 
conventional nacelle structures as illustrated in Fig 1 
the gap between the inlet cowl and the fan cowl doors is 
a source
