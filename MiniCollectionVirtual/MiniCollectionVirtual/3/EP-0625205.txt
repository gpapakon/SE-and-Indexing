<ABSTRACT>
A method for modifying the specificity and/or efficiency of an enzyme, while retaining its catalytic activity, characterised in that it comprises: selecting an enzyme, the tertiary structure of which is substantially known or deduced; identifying at least one specificity and/or efficiency-related region; identifying or constructing unique restriction sites bounding the identified region in the DNA coding therefor; generating a DNA sequence which corresponds to at least a portion of the identified region, except that the nucleotides of at least one codon are randomized, or selecting as a substitute for at least a portion of the identified region an alternative such region, which may itself be similarly randomized; using the generated or substitute DNA sequence to replace the original such sequence; expressing the DNA including the generated or substitute DNA sequence; and selecting for a desired modification so that the DNA coding therefor may be isolated is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHIRAL SYNTHESIS WITH MODIFIED ENZYMES.This invention relates to chiral synthesis; more particularly, it relates to the modification of enzymes to facilitate such synthesis.Enzymes are biological catalysts which are specific both in terms of chemical activity and substrate structure, and it is this specificity which has been exploited in a variety of commercial applications. Although many such activities are known, it may be desirable to change the range of substrates that are suitable for catalysis and/or to change the efficiency of a given catalysis for a particular type of enzyme. Given a type of enzyme with known key elements vis-a-vis substrate preference and hence activity, it may be possible purposefully to change those elements to bring about desired modifications and hence to expand the potential industrial utility of a particular enzyme.Enzyme activity is primarily controlled by the amino acid composition especially in certain important functional areas of the enzyme, altering these amino acids is known to change activity and may be achieved by the use of either specific or non-specific techniques. For example, the introduction of a neutralising amino acid may facilitate the catalysis of a substrate with an altered charge and this could be regarded as a predictable alteration, although no result may ever be predicted with total certainty, especially where the tertiary structures of enzymes are not as precisely known as would be necessary for complete confidence. However, while it is possible to make individual changes by known means, this would prove an almost infinite task and so it is often convenient initially to make a "macro-change" and then to "fine tune" with discrete changes. Of course, in a given case, a macro-change may prove to be sufficient, or, indeed, discrete changes may be all that are required. 

 Although alteration of the enzyme structure has been described, this is not achieved by any direct effect on the amino acid components, but by known techniques on the DNA encoding for the enzyme prior to protein transcription. Taking as an example the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (natural substrate pyruvate) , when acting on the carboxylic acid analogue of pyruvate, oxalo acetic acid, it would have substantially reduced activity due to the negative charge introduced into the active site. In this case, site-directed mutagenesis involving the introduction of a neutralizing charge into the correct region of the active site alters substrate specificity allowing the enzyme to take on the
