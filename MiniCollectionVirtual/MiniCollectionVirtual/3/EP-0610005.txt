<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an easily removable label (10) 
for use in connection with a container (34) to be recycled 

(e.g. bottle or can). The label has first and second faces 
(12, 14). Indicia (19) is provided on the first face (12) 

and a coating of repositionable adhesive (28) is applied to 
the second face. The label is also provided with leading and 

trailing edges (16, 18) which cooperate to form an 
overlapping area (24) with permanent adhesive (20) which 

secures one face of the label to the other while at the same 
time precluding contact of the permanent adhesive with the 

container. The label may be provided with a perforation line 
(26) adjacent the overlapping area so that the label may be 

conveniently separated from the container. The face of the 
label may be coated with permanent pressure sensitive 

adhesive release material (32), and a number of labels 
provided in a pad. The label provides a lasting adhesion 

between the container and the label but yet will not leave 
any significant residue of permanent adhesive (20) once the 

label is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an easily 
removable label that is securely attached to a 
container yet facilitates recycling by leaving no 
permanent adhesive residue on the container once the 
label is separated. It is known to apply labels to various types of 
containers. One such method of applying labels is 
by mechanical means which involve permanently 
adhering the label to the container by a press or a 
similar device to prevent slippage or detachment of 
the label from the product. Another method that is 
used involves heat shrinking a thermoplastic 
material around the container to provide a body 
conforming label. A still further method is to 
provide a label with temporary bonding 
characteristics so that the web may then be wrapped 
about the container while the label is temporarily 
bonded to the bottle or can. With increased interest in recycling, the 
recycler is often faced with the onerous task of 
having to remove the label prior to recycling the 
container. When using one of the aforementioned 
processes remnants of the label or adhesive patterns 
may remain with the container after the initial 
stripping step has been completed, or the adhesion 
of the label to the can, bottle, or other container  
 
may be less than desirable. If remnants of adhesive 
remain, the recycler must then subject the container 
to a second or even third label/adhesive removal 
step. Such additional steps are generally time 
consuming and expensive, thereby decreasing the 
desirability of containers which have labels that 
are difficult to remove. However, manufacturers 
need to provide consumer goods which are 
aesthetically appealing and ones which will retain 
their labels during shipping and handling. In order to remove those labels which have been 
permanently applied by mechanical means, time 
consuming and resource intensive efforts, such as 
water soaking or high pressure water jet, are 
typically used. This problem is then compounded by 
the recycler having to then treat the waste water 
used in the label removal process. Thus, containers 
having such permanently applied labels may be less 
appealing to the recycler due to the increased cost 
associated with the reclamation of the container. Heat shrink labels on the other hand, while not 
permanently adhered to a container due to their body 
conforming fit, typically have to be cut or torn 
from the container, particularly with respect to 
glass and metal containers. However, due to the 
very snug and body conforming fit which accompany 
the

A label (10) for use with a container, comprising: 
   a substrate (11) having first and second faces (12, 

14) and first and second edges (16, 18); 
   indicia (19) printed on said first face (12); 

   a coating of removable adhesive (28) disposed on said 
second face (14) of said substrate; and 

   a pattern of permanent adhesive (20) disposed 
adjacent said first edge (16) on one face of said substrate, 

and an adhesive receiving area (24) disposed adjacent said 
second edge (18) so as to form a cooperating mating surface 

for said pattern of permanent adhesive. 
A container and label combination, comprising: 
   a container (34, 34', 50) having an exterior surface 

having a circumference; 
   a label substrate (11) having first and second faces 

(12, 14) and a generally quadrate configuration, and first 
and second opposite edges (16, 18), said first and second 

edges spaced from each other a distance greater than said 
container circumference, said substrate wrapped around said 

container exterior surface with said first and second edges 
(16, 18) overlapping each other; 

   indicia (19) printed on said first face of said 
substrate indicating the contents of said container; 

   a coating of repositional adhesive (28) disposed on 
said substrate second face (14) and in contact with said 

container exterior surface to removably hold said substrate 
in secure contact with said container exterior surface over 

the majority of the length of said substrate; and
