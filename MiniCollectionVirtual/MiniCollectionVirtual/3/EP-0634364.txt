<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing ultrapure water 
having a very low concentration of organisms, consisting 

of the steps of thermally decomposing raw water under 
acidic conditions having pH of not more than 4.5 and in 

the presence of an oxidizer so as to decompose a TOC 
component of the water, and then deionizing the resultant 

product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing pure
water (deionized water including ultrapure water) and, more
particuraly, to a method of producing ultrapure water which
can greatly reduce TOC (total organic carbon) in the
pure water than a conventional method.I. A conventional water purifying apparatus for
producing ultrapure water from raw water such as city water,
well water and industrial water is composed of a
pretreatment equipment, a primary pure water equipment and
secondary pure water equipment. The pretreatment equipment
is composed of coagulation, floatation and filtration
units. The primary pure water equipment is composed of
two reverse osmosis membrane units and a mixed bed
ion exchange unit, or a demineralization equipment
and a reverse osmosis membrane unit. The secondary pure
water equipment is composed of a low pressure mercury
ultraviolet oxidization unit, a demineralization
equipment and an ultrafilter (ultrafiltration membrane
separation device).Either the following process (i) or (ii) is adopted.
(i) Raw water → coagulation, floatation, filtration units
→ first reverse osmosis membrane unit → second 
reverse osmosis membrane unit → mixed bed
ion exchange unit → primary pure water storage
tank → low pressure mercury ultraviolet oxidization
unit → demineralization equipment → ultrafilter →
ultrapure water(ii) Raw water → coagulation, floatation,
filtration units → ion exchange equipment [ two-bed
three- tower type (cation exchange tower → vacuum
degas tower or decarbonation tower → anion exchange
tower ) or four-bed five tower type (first cation
exchange tower → second anion exchange tower → vacuum
degas tower or decarbonation tower → second cation
exchange tower → second anion exchange tower )] →
reverse osmosis membrane unit → primary pure water
storage tank → low pressure mercury ultraviolet
oxidization unit → mixed bed ion exchange unit →
ultrafilter → ultrapure waterThe above deminerlization equipment comprises an anion
exchange column, a mixed bed ion exchange column or an
anion exchange column and a mixed bed ion exchange column
which are arranged in series.Among these units and equipments, the reverse osmosis membrane
units, the demineralization equipment and the low
pressure mercury ultraviolet oxidization unit reduce
the TOC components in raw water by separation, adsorption,
decomposition or the like.TOC reducing mechanisms of these units or equipmemts
are as follows. Reverse osmosis membrane unit : Raw water is
filtered through a reverse osmosis membrane so as to

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing pure water from raw water
containing hydrofluoric acid and TOC components comprising:


contacting the raw water with a weak basic anion
exchange resin to remove fluoride ions from the raw

water,
making the raw water acidic so that the pH is not more
than 4.5 and heating in the presence of an oxidizing

agent to thermally decompose the TOC components in said
raw water, and
deionizing the raw water.
A method of producing pure water according to
claim 1, wherein the step of making the raw water acidic and

heating in the presence of an oxidizing agent is effected by
adding an oxidizing agent and an acid to the raw water and

heating the resultant mixture.
A method of producing pure water according to
either of claims 1 and 2, wherein said raw water contains

hydrogen peroxide, and a persulfate is added to said raw
water prior to the thermal decomposition.
A method of producing pure water according to any
one of claims 1 to 3, wherein after the thermal

decomposition, the raw water is degassed at a high
temperature, and then deionized.
A method of producing pure water according to any
one of claims 1 and 4, wherein thermal decomposition of said

TOC components in the raw water is conducted at 110 to 170°C
for 2 to 5 minutes. 
A method of producing pure water according to
claim 5, wherein the temperature for said thermal

decomposition is 130 to 150°C.
