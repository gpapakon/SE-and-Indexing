<ABSTRACT>
Brush gear 50 for a miniature electric motor has an elongate brush arm having one end 
11 connected to a brush holder 20, and the other end 12 adapted for contact with a 

commutator. Vibration dampening means in the form of a tube 30 is shrunk onto the 
brush arm intermediate of its ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to brush gear for a miniature electric motor and in particular to 
brush gear incorporating vibration dampening means. It is known to provide brush gear for miniature motors with vibration dampening 
means to reduce brush bounce and thus reduce electrical noise created by the motor. 
Many types of materials have been tried including rubber, paper and grease. However, 
in time, the adhesive used to hold the dampener in place ages and may fail or the 
grease may migrate or fall from the brush arm with possible contamination of the 
commutator or other parts within the motor. The present invention seeks to mitigate these disadvantages by providing the vibration 
dampening means in the form of a tube which is shrunk onto the brush arm. This 
provides good fixing of the tube to the brush arm which may be further enhanced by 
adhesive. The structure of the tube means that adhesive is not essential and thus 
adhesive failure will not result in the dampening means separating from the brush arm 
as in the prior art. Accordingly, the present invention provides brush gear for a miniature electric motor 
comprising: an elongate brush arm having a proximal end and a distal end, the 
proximal end being connected to a brush holder and the distal end being adapted for 
sliding contact with a commutator; and vibration dampening means applied to the 
brush arm intermediate the proximal and distal ends, wherein the vibration dampening 
means comprises a tube shrunk onto the brush arm. The brush arm may be of the finger brush type in which the distal end is divided into a 
number of fingers by slits extending into an intermediate portion and the dampening 
means is a single tube extending over the root of the fingers or a plurality of tubes 
fitted to respective fingers. The fitting of individual tubes to the fingers allows for possible variations on the 
dampening applied to each of the fingers so that the natural resonance frequencies of 
the fingers can be deliberately mismatched to produce a quieter motor. However, the 
single tube is easier and quicker to apply and provides acceptable dampening when  
 
noise levels are not so critical. Suitable shaping of the end of the tube may provide a 
small degree of variation in finger dampening if desired. The invention also extends to a miniature electric motor incorporating such brush gear. Brush gear according to the invention will now be described, by way of example only, 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
