<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for detecting engine 
overheating and controlling engine ignition timing 

utilizes a single temperature sensor. The temperature 
sensor is positioned adjacent a cylinder head of an 

engine. A rate of engine temperature increase is 
calculated based on engine temperature information 

produced by the temperature sensor, and engine speed is 
regulated based on the calculated rate of engine 

temperature increase. Ignition timing is also 
controlled in response to the engine temperature information 

produced by the temperature sensor, and the 
engine speed is regulated to a predetermined speed value 

whenever the engine temperature exceeds a predetermined 
temperature value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine ignition timing control
apparatus, and particularly to an engine ignition timing control
apparatus which uses a temperature sensor and is suitably used
for a marine engine such as an outboard motor.Generally, marine engines, etc., are air-cooled
engines, in which there is adopted a system to draw up
water by pump and discharge the water after the water
has been circulated within the engine. Recent marine engines, especially engines of
outboard motors, employ a starting spark advance method
for automatically advancing the ignition timing from the
maximum spark delaying time in order to enhance the
starting performance. This method employs not only such
a function as to spark advance the ignition timing under
a certain condition but also such a function for
controlling the spark advance time or ignition timing by
engine temperature. On the other hand, such engines
generally include an overheat warning function for
detecting, in case the engine is overheated due to
inferior cooling water pumping or the like, rising
engine temperature and giving a warning to the operator
by generating a buzzer sound, lighting a lamp or the
like. Such an ignition timing control system is disclosed
for example in US-A-4 606 315.A general spark advance mechanism for outboard
motors is constructed such that a stator of a magneto is
cooperatively worked with the opening degree of a
throttle so as to be mechanically slided. However,
there has been employed recently another method in which
a throttle sensor is mounted on a throttle shaft of a
carburetor, and signals of the opening degree of this
sensor are input into an ignition circuit to obtain an
ignition timing in correspondence with the opening
degree of the throttle.Furthermore, since a very low speed and smooth
rotation called "trolling rotation" is required for the
outboard motor, the ignition timing of the totally
closed time of the throttle, in many cases, is
considerably delayed from the top dead center for the 
purpose of lowering the exploding pressure. However,
since the combustion speed is slow at the starting time,
if the ignition timing is left as delayed, the starting
performance is inefficient and it is necessary to spark
advance close to 10° before the upper dead center piston
position.In view of the above, the engines of the throttle
sensor spark advance type employ, in many cases, such a
function as to automatically spark advance at the
starting time. In these engines, the duration of spark
advance time is changed by a
