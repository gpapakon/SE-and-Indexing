<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus 
for producing a thermal stress relieving zone in an 
automotive heat exchanger. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an apparatus for shearing a side 
support of an automotive heat exchanger core to produce a 
thermal stress relieving zone. Typical automotive heat exchangers, such as radiators, 
include a plurality of thin-walled tubes interleaved with 
corrugated fins enclosed in a core frame. The fins are 
rigidly attached to the tubes as well as to a pair of frame 
side supports while the tubes are joined to a pair of 
headers. The frame side supports are attached also to the 
headers. As is well known in the art, coolant passes from 
one header through the tubing to the other header. As the 
temperature of the coolant passing through the heat 
exchanger core increases, the core expands. The frame side 
supports, however, are not in direct heat contact with the 
liquid and, as such, do not heat at a proportional rate to 
the heating of the tubing. As a result of the expansion and 
contraction of the tubing, the side supports induce thermal 
stress in the tube-to-header joints during the thermal 
cycling of the heat exchanger, often leading to durability 
problems such as cracking or leaking of the tubes. To overcome this thermal cycling problem and to 
increase the durability of the heat exchanger core, it is 
known in the art to relieve the thermally-induced stress by 
saw cutting the side supports following brazing of the core 
and prior to placing the heat exchanger core into service. 
However, the saw cutting operation is difficult to automate, 
is excessively loud, and produces a tremendous amount of 
metal fines resulting in increased downtime and increased 
maintenance of the saw. Other methods have been proposed to relieve the 
thermally-induced stress in the heat exchanger core without 
the need for saw cutting the side supports. For example,  
 
U.S. Patent No. 4,719,967 proposes the use of a "T-shaped" 
or "I-shaped" slot or piercing stamped into the core 
reinforcement prior to forming the reinforcement into a 
channel member. After brazing the core assembly, the 
reinforcement is fractured at the perforation to allow for 
expansion of the core during thermal cycling of the heat 
exchanger. The use of such a "T-shaped" or "I-shaped" 
perforation may be difficult to maintain since the 
perforation may fill up with filler metal such as cladding 
or solder during the brazing of the core and may also 
prematurely

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for producing a thermal stress 
relieving zone (26) in a frame (10) of an automotive heat 

exchanger (16), said frame (10) including a pair of channel-shaped 
side supports (24), each of said side supports having 

a generally planar base portion (28) with an elliptical 
aperture (32) formed therein and a pair of flanges (30) 

extending generally perpendicularly to the plane of said 
base, said apparatus comprising zone producing means for 

producing the stress relieving zone (26) in said pair of side 
supports (24), characterised in that said apparatus further 

includes: 

support means (36,72,74) for receiving and supporting 
said heat exchanger (16); and in that said zone producing 

means include, 
side support engaging means (62,64) arranged at a 
location adjacent said elliptical aperture; and shearing 

means (78,80) operatively associated with said side support 
engaging means, said shearing means being disposed generall 

perpendicularly to the plane of said flanges and operative 
to reciprocate between a first position removed from said 

flanges (30) and a second position in engagement with said 
flanges at said elliptical aperture, so that said means 

(78,80) shears each of said flanges (30) with respect to 
said base portion (28) of said side support (24) at said 

elliptical aperture when in said second position. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said 
shearing means comprises a pair of fluid actuated punches, 

each of said punches being disposed generally 
perpendicularly to the plane of said flanges and operative 

to reciprocate between said first position and said second 
position. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said 
side support engaging means comprises a pair of C-shaped  

 
yoke members, each yoke member including a die portion, said 

die portion being operative to reciprocate in a direction 
generally perpendicularly to the plane of said flanges. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, wherein said 
pair of die portions are further operative to reciprocate 

simultaneously with said pair of punches in an opposite 
direction to the movement of said punches so as to shear 

said flanges. 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, wherein said 
yoke member further includes said pair of punches, each of 

said punches being disposed in a cylinder rigidly secured to 
said die portion. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said 
pair of punches are pneumatically actuated. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said 
pair of punches are hydraulically actuated.
