<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a locking plier hand tool 
comprises first and second jaw elements, each said jaw element 

having a free forward end and a rear end, a pair of handles 
operatively connected to said first and second jaw elements for 

movement of the jaw elements toward and away from each other, 
adjusting means for adjusting a spacing between the jaw elements, 

locking means for locking jaw elements in closed position; said 
first jaw element having a central portion positioned between said 

front and rear ends thereof, said central portion having a recess 
formed by first and second contacting portions positioned at an 

angle to each other and a third contacting portion interconnecting 
said first and second contacting portions; each said first and 

second contacting portions having one end connected to said third 
contacting portion and a free end;

 
   said second jaw element having a central area situated 

between said front end and said rear end, an arc shaped protuberant 
extending outwardly from said central area in the direction of said 

recess;
 

   whereby in use, when a workpiece is positioned between 
said first and second jaw elements, said workpiece engages at least 

said first and second contacting portions of said recess and said 
arc shaped protuberant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hand tools according to the preamble part of claim 1.The recent explosion of the bicycle industry substantially
increases the demand for a universal hand tool which fits a variety
of hex-type and other fasteners and which also can be used to
adjust spokes of the bicycle wheels. The fasteners that are used
by the manufacturers of conventional bicycles come in a great many
sizes and configurations. Therefore, when conventional hand tools
such as locking pliers and adjustable wrenches are used to adjust
such fasteners, the teeth of such hand tools continuously strip the
exterior of the fastener. Since it is difficult, if not completely
impossible, to continuously use the stripped fasteners, their
replacement becomes necessary. Such drawback, in addition to a
substantial inconvenience, increases the cost of the maintenance
and in the long run might reduce the life span of the bicycle.
Furthermore, conventional hand tools or locking pliers are
typically bulky and can not be kept in a storage compartment of the 
bicycle. Still further, conventional locking pliers cannot be used
for adjustment of spokes of the bicycle wheels and use of a
separate spoke wrench becomes necessary.In a pipe wrench as known from FR-A-2125796 the pivot point of the
moveable jaw element can be adjusted into different engagement
positions within an obliquely arranged slot in the stationary
handle member. The moveable jaw element is of rounded shape and
defines a protuberance for co-operation with an engaging recess in
the other jaw. Said engaging recess is defined by flat surfaces
arranged with different angular orientations. Due to the
configuration of the flat contacting surfaces and the flat interconnecting
middle section in the stationary jaw element screw
heads or screw nuts or even round work pieces will advantageously
be gripped at several circumferentially distributed contact
regions, irrespective of their size or shape.A locking plier handtool as known from US-A-3635107 (figure 7) is
provided with a central recessed portion in one jaw element and a
flat central area situated between the front and rear ends of the
second jaw element. Figure 5 shows mutually co-operating flat jaw
portions. It is a task of the invention to create a
universal hand tool
having jaws which are especially configurated to provide firm
gripping action on workpieces of various shapes and which tool
could be used for adjustment of different types of fasteners
without deforming and destroying them.
The hand tool should be
adapted

<CLAIMS>
A hand tool comprising:

a first jaw element (16) having a forward end (42) and a
rear end (44); a second jaw element (14) having a

forward end (48) and a rear end (50); a pair of handles
(12, 18) operatively connected to said first jaw element

and said second jaw element for movement of said first
jaw element (16) toward and away from said second jaw

element (14) from a substantially open position to a
substantially closed position and vice versa; said first

jaw element (16) having a central portion (46)
positioned bewtween said forward and rear ends (42, 44)

thereof, said central portion (46) having an engaging recess
(54); said second jaw element (14) having a central area

(52) situated between said forward end and said rear end
(48, 50) thereof;

said engaging recess (54) being formed by
a first contacting portion (41), a second contacting

portion (43) at an angle with respect to said first
contacting portion (41), and a third contacting portion

(45) interconnecting said first contacting portion (41)
and said second contacting portion (43), wherein each of

said first contacting portion and said second contacting
portion (41, 43) having one end connected to said third

contacting portion (43) and a free end (47, 49) of the
first jaw element (16);
said central area (52) comprising an arc shaped
protrusion (56) that extends outwardly from said central

area (52) toward said engaging recess (54);
