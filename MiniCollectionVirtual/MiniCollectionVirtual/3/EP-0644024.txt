<ABSTRACT>
A process for making cellular-concrete elements on a lime base comprises inter alia the steps: producing a milk-of-lime from sand, lime, cement, other additives and water, addition of aluminium powder as gas-forming agent, pouring the mixture thus obtained into a moulding box (1), allowing the mass situated in the moulding box to rise and partially set, which mass is then supplied to further processing steps. In order to achieve the desired properties of the end product with greater reliability, vibrating oscillations are applied, after the mixture has been poured into the moulding box, to the box as a whole from underneath on one side in the region of one of its bottom longitudinal edges (4) and ended at the latest when the mass has essentially finished its rising process.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of lime-based aerated concrete
bodies which includes the following steps:


producing a slurry from sand, lime, cement, further additives
and water,
adding aluminium powder as a propellant,
pouring the resulting mixture into a moulding box, and
allowing the mass in the moulding box to rise and partially
harden, the mass then being passed to further processing steps,

   characterised in that after the mixture is poured into the
moulding box (1) jolting vibrations are applied to the moulding box as a

whole at one end from below in the region of one of its bottom
longitudinal edges (4) and are concluded at the latest when the mass has

substantially concluded its rising phase.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the
jolting operation is concluded a few seconds before conclusion of the

rising phase.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the jolting vibrations are applied to the moulding box (1) by a

respective jolting arrangement (10) which includes an out-of-balance
motor (20) being pressed against each of two spaced-apart locations in

the region of its one bottom longitudinal edge (4).
A process according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the jolting frequencies are in the range of 10 Hz

to 50 Hz.
A process according to claim 4 characterised in that the
jolting frequency used is increased in proportion to an increased

desired density of the finished aerated concrete body. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the jolting operation is begun about five to

fifteen seconds after the mixture is poured into the moulding box (1).
A process according to claim 6 characterised in that the slurry
includes the following constituents in percent by weight:


sand 37% to 43%,
retro material 8% to 12%,
lime 10% to 16%,
cement 3% to 5%, and
water 30% to 37%

and about 0.06% to 0.15% aluminium powder is added to said slurry.
A process according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that reinforcing elements for the finished aerated

concrete body are introduced into the moulding box (1) before the
mixture is poured in.
Apparatus which for carrying out the process according to one
or more of the preceding claims includes the following components:


a mixing device for producing the slurry and for adding the
aluminium powder, and
a pouring device for pouring the resulting mixture into moulding
boxes (1),

   and which is characterised in that it further includes at least
one time-controllable jolting arrangement (10) for applying jolting

vibrations to the moulding box (1) containing the rising mixture,
wherein the jolting arrangement is arranged at one side in the region of

a bottom longitudinal edge (4) of the moulding box.
Apparatus according to claim 9 characterised in that it
includes at least one pressing device, by means of which a plate (18)

mechanically connected to an out-of-balance motor (20) can be pressed
against the underside of the moulding box (1).
