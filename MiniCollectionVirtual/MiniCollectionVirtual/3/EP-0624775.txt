<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (
2
) that performs high resolution thickness metrology on a thin film 
layer of a wafer (
24
), includes a filtered white light source that forms a collimated 
monochromatic light beam (
19
). The filtered white light source includes a halogen lamp 
(
10
), a condensing lens (
12
), a circular aperture (
14
), a collimator lens (
16
), and a 
narrow band filter wheel (
18
). The collimated monochromatic light beam (
19
) is passed 
through a beamsplitter (
60
), a second collimator lens (
20
), a third collimator lens (
22
), 
and a lenslet array (
38
), such that a corresponding array of sample points (
39
) on the 
surface of the wafer (
24
) are irradiated with focused monochromatic light. A reflectance 
pattern is formed at each sample point (
39
) due to coherent interactions in the 
monochromatic light as it is reflected within the wafer structure (
24
). An image of each 
reflectance pattern is reflected off the surface of the wafer (
24
) and is directed onto a 
detector array (
31
) of a charge coupled device (CCD) camera (
30
). Each reflectance 
pattern image is displayed on the CCD camera detector array (
31
) and captured by the 
CCD camera (
30
). Each captured image is digitized by a digitizing circuit (
34
) and 
stored by a computer (
36
). The computer (
36
) then compares this measured reflectance 
data to reference reflectance data already stored so as to determine the thickness of the 

thin film layer at each sample point (
39
) on the wafer (
24
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and method for performing 
thin film layer thickness metrology and, in particular, to an apparatus for performing high 
resolution thin film layer thickness metrology including means for irradiating a surface of 
a layer of material with an array of focused monochromatic radiation. One application wherein the present invention is especially practical, is in 
conjunction with measurements of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor wafers. 
Typically, an SOI wafer consists of an Si/SiO₂/Si sandwich structure, and is fabricated by 
growing a silicon dioxide (SiO₂) film on one surface of each of two silicon (Si) wafers 
and bonding the two silicon dioxide film surfaces together and annealing at high 
temperature. An outer surface of one of the two silicon wafers in the sandwich structure 
is then mechanically ground and polished to an average thickness of several microns. 
Unfortunately, this mechanical grinding and polishing results in large spatial variations in 
the thickness of this outer silicon layer. To reduce such spatial variations, a thickness 
error map indicating thickness non-uniformities in this outer silicon layer over its entire 
surface is required, for example, to initialize a micropolishing process. One particular apparatus and method of obtaining such a thickness error map is 
described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/804,872, filed on December 6, 1991, 
entitled, Apparatus and Method for Measuring the Thickness of Thin Films, and assigned 
to the assignee hereof. The above-identified application is hereby incorporated herein by 
reference. Therein, thickness non-uniformities in the outer silicon layer are obtained by 
measuring reflectance characteristics over a full aperture of the outer silicon layer surface 
and then comparing this measured reflectance data to reference reflectance data by using 
numerical iteration or by using a calibration wafer having known outer silicon layer 
thicknesses. The reflectance characteristics are measured by projecting collimated  
 
monochromatic light onto the entire outer silicon layer surface such that coherent 
interactions occur in the light as it is reflected at the physical boundaries of the sandwich 
structure. As a result of these coherent interactions, an interference fringe pattern is 
formed on the outer silicon layer surface, a reflected image of which is captured by a 
charge coupled device (CCD) camera. From the captured interference fringe pattern 
image a reflectance
