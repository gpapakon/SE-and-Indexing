<ABSTRACT>
A multi-branch digital optical switch (10) having three branch waveguides through which light may exit. The multi-branch digital optical switch includes a main waveguide (12), two side branch waveguides (16, 18), and one center branch waveguide (14). The two side branch waveguides diverge symmetrically from the center branch waveguide at angles which are sufficiently small to allow modal evolution through the switch to be substantially adiabatic. Electric fields are used to raise the index of refraction of one side branch waveguide above the index of the center branch waveguide and to lower the index of refraction of the other side branch below the index of the center branch waveguide. The switch has an extinction ratio of 700:1 (28 dB) between its two side branches.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical switches, and in particular to 
digital optical switches having one main waveguide that branches into at least three 
other waveguides. Optical waveguides are used to route optical power between pre-selected 
paths. Waveguides can be fabricated from a number of different materials 
including both crystalline and amorphous materials. Some of such materials 
exhibit an electro-optic effect wherein changes in the index of refraction occur in 
the presence of an electric field. A waveguide can be fabricated by growing 
successive crystalline layers of, for example, gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) 
and gallium arsenide (GaAs). Other examples of materials that are useful in 
fabricating waveguides are lithium niobate (LiNbO3), lithium tantalate (LiTaO3), 
zinc oxide (ZnO), and glassy polymers doped with non-linear optical moieties. 
The ability to alter the index of refraction with an electric field is useful for 
fabricating integrated optical circuits using optical switches and modulators. 
Optical waveguides may be used to form photonic chips which can be used in 
optical recording, telecommunication, computing, and imaging graphics. Optical waveguides having, one input branch and two output branches are 
known as Y switches. US-A- 3,883,220 discloses a Y switch 
that branches into two spatially separated optical paths. In the absence of an 
electric field, light entering the waveguide is equally split between the two paths. 
When an appropriate electric field is applied across one of the optical paths, the 
index of refraction of that path is lowered and thereby diverts or switches optical 
energy from that path to the other path. US-A- 4,070,092 
discloses a Y switch wherein the index of refraction of one arm of the Y is raised 
a small amount, Δn, by an electric field and the refractive index of the second arm 
is lowered by that same amount.  
 Optical waveguides having two input branches and two output branches are 
known as X switches. US-A- 4,775,207 discloses an X 
switch which includes two convergent input and two divergent output waveguides, 
and electrodes for generating an electric field adjacent to the point of convergence 
of the output waveguides. In an X or Y switch where both output branches have the same refractive 
index, optical energy entering the switch in any given local normal mode will be 
split equally between the output branch waveguides. However, if one of the output 
branches has a higher refractive index than the other branch, the
