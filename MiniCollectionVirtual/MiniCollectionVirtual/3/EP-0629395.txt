<ABSTRACT>
Dual-type keratinous fiber treatment compositions 
composed of two agents, i.e., an agent A containing an 

aromatic compound having a sulfuric group, a sulfonic group, a 
phosphoric group, a phosphonic group, or a carboxyl group and 

an agent B containing a polyvalent metal salt, do not destroy 
the inherent flexible and soft feel to the touch of the 

fibers, can give fibers a new shape while imparting firmness 
and resilience, enhance the shape-giving effect of curling, 

waving or perming, and hold the shape given to the keratinous 
fibers by way of chemical treatment such as perming or the 

like for a prolonged period of time while avoiding damage 
caused by such treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to keratinous fiber 
treatment compositions with which keratinous fibers such as 
hair, wool, and fibers for woolen fabrics are chemically 
treated. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
keratinous fiber treatment compositions which give 
keratinous fibers bounce (firmness and resilience), and 
which enhance the shape-giving effect of curling, waving, 
straight-perming or the like on keratinous fibers, and which 
result in the treated keratinous fibers holding the shape for 
a prolonged period of time. The present invention also 
relates to a method of treating keratinous fibers with such a 
composition and kits containing such keratinous fiber 
treatment compositions. Numbers of keratinous fiber treatment compositions have 
been reported which incorporate polymers and conditioning 
agents for imparting firmness and resilience to keratinous 
fibers including hair, wool, and fibers for woolen fabrics 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) 7449/1977, 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) 216113/1983). 
These compositions exhibit their effects when the compositions 
adsorb onto the surface of keratinous fibers. However, they 
result in a poor feeling to the touch, such as a dry and loose  
 
feeling, and also cause annoyance by requiring frequent 
treatments, because the adsorbed treatment compositions come 
off when the treated fibers are washed. Moreover, in order to give a new shape such as curls and 
waves to keratinous fibers, methods including setting with 
temporary setting agents such as blowing agents for the hair 
and chemically and semi-permanently treating the hair with 
perm lotions or the like are typically employed. Keratinous 
fibers which are set with temporary setting agents lose the 
shape given by the setting agents when they are exposed to 
elevated humidity or get wet. On the other hand, curls and 
waves formed by perming are softened when washed repeatedly, 
and therefore, the effect of holding the desired shape for a 
prolonged period is not always satisfactory. Moreover, 
straight-perming, which reforms frizzy fibers into a straight 
form, is problematic in that the frizzy keratinous fibers are 
not always be straightened to the extent desired. In order to solve these problems, attempts of reforming 
the fibers themselves in a sustained manner by having 
treatment agents penetrated into the keratinous fibers have 
been proposed, which include treatment compositions containing 
astringents (Japanese Patent Application
