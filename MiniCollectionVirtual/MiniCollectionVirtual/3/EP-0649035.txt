<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and techniques for making 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in boreholes, and to 
methods for determining magnetic characteristics of formations traversed by 
a borehole. Repeated attempts have been made to use the principles of 
nuclear magnetic resonance to log wells in oil exploration over the past 
several decades, with limited success. It was recognized that any particles of 
a formation having magnetic spin, for example atomic nuclei, protons, or 
electrons, have tendencies to align with a magnetic field which is imposed on 
the formation. Such a magnetic field may be naturally generated, as is the 
case with the earth's magnetic field BE which has an intensity of 
approximately 0.5 gauss in areas of the globe where boreholes are typically 
drilled. Any given particle in a formation is additionally influenced by 
localized magnetic fields associated with nearby magnetic particles, other 
paramagnetic materials, and the layer of ions which typically line pore walls 
of certain types of formations such as shales. These localized fields tend to be 
inhomogeneous, while the earth's magnetic field is relatively homogeneous. The hydrogen nuclei (protons) of water and hydrocarbons 
occurring in rock pores produce NMR signals distinct from any signals 
induced in other rock constituents. A population of such nuclei, having a net 
magnetization, tends to align with any imposed field such as BE.  
 When a second magnetic field B1 transverse to BE is imposed on 
the protons by a logging tool electromagnet, the protons will align with the 
vector sum of BE and B1 after a sufficient polarization time tpol has passed. 
If the polarizing field B1 is then switched off, the protons will tend to precess 
about the BE vector with a characteristic Larmor frequency ωL which 
depends on the strength of the earth's field BE and the gyromagnetic 
constant of the particle. Hydrogen nuclei precessing about a magnetic field 
BE of 0.5 gauss have a characteristic frequency of approximately 2 kHz. If a 
population of hydrogen nuclei were made to precess in phase, the combined 
magnetic fields of all the protons can generate a detectable oscillating 
voltage in a receiver coil. Since the magnetic moment of each proton 
produces field inhomogeneities, the precessing protons tend to lose their 
phase coherence over time, with a characteristic time constant called the 
transverse or spin-spin relaxation time T2. Furthermore, field 
inhomogeneities are also produced by other
