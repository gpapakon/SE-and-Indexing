<ABSTRACT>
A CDMA signal receiving apparatus for a base station is 
disclosed. The apparatus is characterized by a spread-spectrum 

demodulation section which has a plurality of 
channel-signal processing sections (105-105+k) and a common-signal 

processing section (108). Each of said channel-signal processing 
section receives a digital spread-spectrum modulated base 

band signal and performs a reception processing of a channel 
signal by means of spread-spectrum demodulation using 

common data, wherein the channel signal refers to a digital 
spread-spectrum demodulated base band signal destined to 

the channel of concern. The common-signal processing 
section (108) computes, from the digital spread-spectrum modulated 

base band signal, values required in common to all of the 
channel-signal processing sections for the spread-spectrum 

demodulation to be processed in each of the channel-signal 
processing sections, and outputs the values as the common 

data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a CDMA (Code Division
Multiple Access) receiver for a mobile communication system
such as a mobile telephone and portable telephone system (a
cellular system), and particularly to an art for lessening
the scale of hardware of a transmitter and a receiver for
canceling interference between channels.As a prior art of a digital mobile telephone and
portable telephone system having a cellular layout, the
Japan standard system (PDC: RCR STD 27A), and the North
America Standard System (ETSI GSM) have been known in which
the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is adopted.
The North America Standard System (TIA IS95) has been also
known in which the CDMA scheme is employed.In Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 323926/92 (hereinafter,
referred to as reference 1) and 351130/92 (hereinafter,
referred to as reference 2), CDMA receivers are described.
The receiver of reference 1 is directed to receiving a DSSS
(Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) signal and is
characterized in that the base band signal is recovered from
the DSSS signal not through a matched filter or a correlator 
as is an ordinary case, but through an inverse filter. The
tap coefficients of the filter are ajusted so that the
filter provides an output response of approximately
Kronecker delta-function characteristic to an incoming
spectrum-spreading PN (Pseudo-random Noise) code which
specifies an individual channel allocated to the receiver.
The reason for using the inverse filter is that a POP (Peak
to Off Peak) ratio is high in an inverse filter compared to
a matched filter, the high POP ratio allowing the output
response of the filter to have said delta function
characteristic. In addition, the PN code sequences are
established so that the inverse filter has the maximum
processing gain. In this way, the technical advantage of
the spread spectrum modulation technique can effectively
serve for the cellular mobile communication system.The reference 2 provides a method of multiple access
for simultaneously exchanging a plurality (say N) of data
streams communicated between a plurality of subscribers in a
communication system. In this method, the N data sequences
are spectrum-spread using a single PN code sequence to
produce corresponding N DSSS signals. In transmission, the
N spectrum-spread sequences are superposed in a single
transmission signal, wherein the superposition is effected
by shifting different sequences of the DSSS signals by a
time interval longer than a prescribed minimum value. On
the reception
