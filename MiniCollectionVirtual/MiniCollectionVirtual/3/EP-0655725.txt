<ABSTRACT>
A memory is provided for storing one field of video signals 
supplied to a liquid crystal display panel serving as a display 

portion. Whether the video signals to be displayed have a 
stationary image portion or a moving image portion is determined 

by a comparator by comparing the video signals of the last field 
read out from the memory and the video signals of the present 

field supplied to the liquid crystal display panel. When it is 
determined that the video signals have a stationary image 

portion, the speed of scanning by a driver is reduced. When the 
scanning speed is low, the power required for the scanning is 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display apparatus for
use in an information processing apparatus, a communications
apparatus, a video apparatus, a game apparatus and an apparatus
mounted in a ship or a vehicle.Conventionally, portable personal computers use liquid
crystal displays of TFT (thin film transistor) active matrix
type where a plurality of dots are horizontally and vertically
arranged in a matrix, as disclosed in JP-A- 2 246 481. To display images, the supply voltage is
supplied from a battery to the liquid crystal display panel to
cause a driver to perform scanning.Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1, this liquid crystal
display has a plurality of signal electrodes 1, scanning
electrodes 2, TFTs 3 and dot electrodes 4 formed in a matrix on
the side of one insulating substrate (not shown), has common
electrodes 5 formed on the side of the other insulating substrate
(not shown) opposite thereto, and has a liquid crystal
layer between the common electrodes 5 and the dot electrodes 4.
Display with the dots is performed by line sequential scanning
by the signal electrodes 1 and the scanning electrodes 2.For example, when a scanning voltage is applied from a gate
driver 6 to the scanning electrode 2 in the first line, the TFTs
3 in the first line connected thereto are activated to connect
the signal electrodes 1 to the dot electrodes 4 in the first 
line, so that a signal voltage (i.e. video signal) is applied
from a source driver 7 to the dots in the first line. By
repeating such an application operation (scanning) for every
line from the first line at a horizontal period, one field of
video signals is displayed on the liquid crystal display, and by
repeating this application operation every field, i.e. at a
vertical period, the image is reproduced. The signal voltage is
inverted every line and every field so that no direct current
component is added to the liquid crystal display.A liquid crystal driving voltage used in such a display
apparatus is high because of the necessity of high duty, and the
supply voltage supplied to the liquid crystal display panel is
comparatively. high. This increases the power consumed while the
image is being displayed, which is a problem when the display
apparatus is used, for example, in a portable apparatus having
a power source such as a battery whose capacity is limited.An object of the present invention is to provide a display
apparatus in which the power consumption is reduced without the
quality of the displayed image being greatly damaged.A display apparatus
