<ABSTRACT>
High temperature superconducting layered structures for use in microwave applications are fabricated by depositing a thin film of epitaxial buffer (14) such as strontium titanate or calcium titanate by a deposition process such as laser ablation on a low loss sapphire substrate (12) followed by depositing an in-situ grown film of high temperature superconductor (16) such as Y1Ba2Cu3O7 on the buffer layer. The YBCO film has low surface resistance and a narrow transition temperature.

 DESCRIPTIONHIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTING FILMS ON ALUMINUM OXIDE SUBSTRATESCross Reference To Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of Serial Number 494,730 filed March 16, 1990, Serial Number 495,568 filed March 16, 1990 and Serial Number 565,691 filed August 13, 1990.Technical FieldThis invention relates to high critical temperature superconducting (HTSC) films and, more particularly, this invention relates to the preparation of HTSC films on sap¬ phire (aluminum oxide) substrates by the use of stable, epitaxial buffer layers.Background of the Invention The recent discovery of high critical temperature superconducting materials has created interest in the use of these materials in microwave devices. The HTSC metal cuprate materials cannot readily be produced in bulk with geometries and properties suitable for microwave devices. Presently, devices based on the HTSC materials are fabri¬ cated by formation of thin films on substrates by tech¬ niques similar to those used to fabricate semiconductor devices. To be useful in a microwave device the HTSC film must be grown on a substrate having low dielectric losses at high frequencies.Silicon, a readily used substrate for semiconductor devices, cannot be used with the HTSC cuprate materials since at the temperature prevalent during deposition the cuprate reactants readily react with silicon. Sapphire (Al203) would appear to be an excellent substrate since it has a very low dielectric loss and is a strong, low cost, highly crystalline material available commercially in large sizes. Sapphire would be a good substrate for bolometer(infrared detector) applications since thin films of sap- phire have low heat capacity. Epitaxial films of a HTSC 

material such as YBa2Cu307 can be grown on sapphire substrat¬ es. However, the optimum window of substrate temperatures during film deposition is relatively narrow [4], At high temperatures above about 700 K, the YBa2Cu307 thin film reacts with the sapphire, especially the Ba atoms. At low temperature, below about 650 K, it is very difficult to produce thin YBa2Cu307 films having good epitaxy.There are other substrate materials that provide epi¬ taxial growth of thin HTSC films with high superconducting transition temperatures and low rf surface resistance, such as strontium titanate (SrTi03) , calcium titanate (CaTi03) , lanthanum alu inate (LaAlO-) , magnesium oxide (MgO) and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) . However, thick substrat¬ es of some of these materials, e.g. strontium or calcium
