<ABSTRACT>
A transparent conductive coating composition comprises 
a conductive powder (a) and a binder resin (b) containing 

(meth)acrylate compound as a main component. The composition 
may further comprise a dispersant (c), a 

photopolymerization initiator (d) or a titanium coupling 
agent (e). A transparent antistatic molded article is made 

of a substrate having a transparent conductive film comprising 
the transparent conductive coating composition described 

above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transparent conductive
coating composition which can be easily set by
active irradiation such as ultraviolet or visible radiation,
to form a coating film superior in conductivity,
transparency, marring resistance and hardness.Further, the present invention relates to a transparent
antistatic molded article superior in marring resistance.Heretofore, materials having antistatic properties have
been used for storage vessels for semiconductor wafers,
electronic/electric parts, floor/wall coverings for a
production factory of semiconductors, etc., wherein static
electrification must be avoided.In order to impart antistatic properties to a molded
article of a synthetic resin, for example, there can be
normally used a method of coating a molded article with a
paint containing a carbon powder, metallic powder, etc., or 
a method of molding a molded article using a synthetic
resin kneaded with a carbon powder, carbon fiber, metallic
fiber, etc.However, the above methods have a problem that a transparent
molded article can not be obtained due to the paint
and coloring of the molded article itself, and the content
can not be seen through the molded article in case of
application for the window part.In order to solve the above problems, various trials
have been made. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 58-91777 discloses a transparent paint
comprising a conductive fine powder of tin oxide as a main
component and a binder.This paint can form a coating film which is transparent
and has antistatic properties, however, the resulting
coating film normally has low hardness because the binder
is a thermoplastic resin, thereby, a coating film having
excellent marring resistance and solvent resistance can not
be obtained.Further, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 60-60166
discloses a transparent paint comprising a conductive
fine powder of tin oxide as a main component and a photoset
ting resin binder. This paint contains a component which is set by ultraviolet or visible radiation.
And the resulting coating film formed by using said paint is superior in transparency,
marring resistance and solvent resistance, and has antistatic function.This paint confers enough marring resistance on the substrate such as acrylic resin
having comparative high surface-hardness, even if the coating film is relatively
thin, and maintains original transparency of said substrate.However, there is a problem, in order to confer enough marring resistance on the
substrate such as
