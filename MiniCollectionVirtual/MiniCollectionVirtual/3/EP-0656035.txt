<ABSTRACT>
A modeling paste is produced by baking a mixture of: flour, water and salt; a thickening agent comprising a mixture of a product (containing 80 % gluten and 20 % grain flour), corn starch and cream of tartar in a volume ratio of approximatively 2:1:1; a food grade anti-mould agent; a food grade liquid silicone based anti-sticking agent; a lanolin based moisture control agent. Said ingredients are mixed with each other before baking. The paste obtained is cooled and kneaded. The modelling paste of the invention has the advantage of being non-toxic, does not stick, does not dry quickly, glazes over very little and can be remoistened when dry. A method for preparing the composition is also disclosed.
