<ABSTRACT>
Automatic pipetting device, in which only one pipetting needle having a corresponding metering or transport device for the pipetting needle is provided, the pipetting needle being connected via a first tube and a first T-connector to a metering syringe. In order to allow fast and thorough cleaning of the internal space of the pipetting needle with low expenditure, the pipetting device is characterised in that one branch of the first T-connector (13) is connected to a cleaning device which contains the following components:   a) a piston pump (24) which is connected via a second T-connector (23), a second tube (22) and a first valve (21) to one branch of the first T-connector (13), b) a suction tube (32) which is immersed in a cleaning liquid contained in a first container (33) and which is connected via a second valve (31) to one branch of the second T-connector (23), and c) a control device (41) for controlling the first valve (21), the second valve (31) and the piston pump (24).
