<ABSTRACT>
The tie-down device in the side walls (1) of lorries, in particular in plywood panels, has a plurality of lashing pots (2) arranged one on top of the other at a distance in horizontal rows with a rod (3) lying in each lashing pot and extending centrally, and these lashing pots (2) are inserted and positionally secured in recesses (4) of the side wall (1) from the inside of the inside wall at least almost flush with the wall surface (1a). Each lashing pot (2) has a pot shape which is that of a truncated cone, tapers towards the base (5) of the pot and has on the open side of the pot a flange (6) which runs around on the outside and extends parallel to the base (5) of the pot. Each lashing pot (2) is inserted in a milled-out portion (4), in the shape of a truncated cone, at least with its pot casing (7) and pot base (5) and is attached in the milled-out portion (4) by means of an adhesive agent (K).

Lashing device in superstructure walls (1) of lorries, 
especially in plywood panels, which has a multiplicity of 

lashing pots (2) disposed one above the other at a distance 
apart in horizontal rows and having a centrally running bar 

(3) situated in each lashing pot, and the lashing pots are 
inserted from the inner side of the superstructure and laid in 

positionally fixed arrangement in cavities (4) in the 
superstructure wall such that they lie at least virtually 

flush with the wall surface (1a), characterised in that 

each lashing pot (2) has a frustoconical pot shape which 
tapers towards the pot base (5), and 
has, on the open pot side, an outer-skirting flange (6) 
which runs parallel to the pot base (5), and 
is inserted, at least with its pot casing (7) and pot 
base (5), in a frustoconical milled recess (4) and is 

fastened in the milled recess (4) by an adhesive (K). 
Lashing device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the pot casing (7) of the lashing pot (2) stands at an 

acute angle (α) of preferably ca. 60° to the pot base (5). 
Lashing device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the bar (3) is of straight-line configuration over its 

entire length and butts with its two longitudinal ends against 
the inner side of the pot casing (7). 
Lashing device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the straight bar (3) has two bent-off longitudinal 

ends (3a), which butt against the inner side (7a) of the pot 
casing (7) and form an at least virtual right-angle (β) with 

the pot casing (7). 
Lashing device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the bar (3), which is straight or is 

bent-off at the end side, is configured as a round bar and 
runs with its outer longitudinal edge (3b) flush with the 

outer side (65a) of the flange. 
Lashing device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the lashing pot (2) is deep-drawn from 

metal in one piece and the bar (3) is welded with its end 
faces to the inner side (7a) of the pot casing (7). 
Lashing device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the lashing pot (2) with integral bar 

(3) consists of aluminium or zinc die-casting or of plastic. 
Lashing device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that on the outer side (6a) of the flange (6) 

of each lashing pot (2) there are provided two installation 
markings (9), which stand at right-angles to each other and 

are formed by elevations and/or indentations, such as grooves 
or the like, one of which runs in extension of the bar (3), 

and in the superstructure wall (1) a counter-marking (10) is 
recessed, formed by an indentation, such as a groove, for 

installation of a pot with vertically or horizontally running 
bar (3).
