<ABSTRACT>
A cellular telephone constituted in a foldable 
structure and having a transmitter, a receiver, a foldable 

telephone main body, a control unit for transmitting/receiving 
a connection control signal, and an external 

interface connector connected to an external interface 
plug, includes a detecting and notifying section for 

detecting an open/closed state of said foldable structure 
and notifying it to said control unit, another detecting 

and notifying section for detecting that said external 
interface connector is connected to said external interface 

plug and notifying it to said control unit, and a setting 
section, arranged in said control unit, for setting a 

response holding state when an incoming call is received in 
a state wherein said external interface plug is connected 

and said foldable structure is open.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foldable cellular telephone.Conventionally, a cellular telephone (mobile phone) which is also for use
in a car has a response holding function for informing a caller, if the incoming
call is received when the user is busy driving, that he/she cannot respond to the
call. For example, a message, eg. "I CANNOT RESPOND TO THE CALL
NOW" is sent. In many cases, a ten-key switch (including a function key) of
the cellular telephone also serves as a response holding switch. For example,
an end key is operated upon reception of an incoming call to set the response
holding state, thereby automatically transmitting a message as described
above.In such a cellular telephone, the ten keys are arranged with small
spacings therebetween, so that it is difficult for the user to depress one
particular key of the ten keys whilst driving the car. Especially, in a cellular
telephone having a foldable structure, when an incoming call is received in a
folded state, two operations are required to set the response holding state.
That is, the cellular telephone must be first opened, and one special key of the
ten keys must be subsequently depressed. Performing these operations during
driving certainly diverts the driver's attention and can be dangerous.WIPO Publication No. WO 91/07836 discloses a cellular telephone
having a foldable body and a vehicle adaptor circuit that allows the function of
a built-in microphone and speaker in the telephone to be transferred to an
external microphone and speaker for hands-free operation.German Patent No. DE-A-3 333 587 A1 and Japanese Publication No.
JP-A-63 115 440 disclose that telephone calls to persons in vehicles may be
placed into an automatic holding state. In the German reference, the holding
state is activated beforehand by the driver, while in the Japanese reference the 
holding state is activated by sensing of vehicle motion.The present invention has been made in consideration of the above
situation, and has as its object to provide a cellular telephone with a more
easily-operated response holding state.According to the invention, there is provided a foldable cellular
telephone that has a microphone, a speaker, a foldable telephone main body,
a control unit for transmitting/receiving a control connection signal, and an
external interface connector connected to an external interface plug. The
foldable cellular telephone includes: means for detecting an open/closed state
of said foldable telephone main body and means for notifying said control unit
of
