<ABSTRACT>
A device for fixing the back of a chair or the like to 
the supporting structure. The device comprises, at the end 

(15) of a vertical portion of the support (16) of the back, 
two oppositely arranged elastically retractable pins (17) 

which are suitable to fit in corresponding seats of 
shoulders (24) which extend from the internal structure (11) 

of the back and between which the end (15) is suitable to be 
inserted and guided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for fixing
the back of a chair or the like to the supporting structure.In some types of currently commercially available
office chairs, the seat and the back are mounted on the ends
of an L-shaped support.The back is substantially composed of an internal
supporting structure which is provided, in an upward region,
with a padding and a covering and is closed, in a downward
region, by a covering shell which is made of plastics and
has, at the rear, an opening for the passage of the
corresponding end of the L-shaped support.This technical configuration entails that the various
parts that compose the back are assembled during the final
assembly of the chair, since it is impossible to work inside
the back to fix the support.The manufacturers of the various components of the
chairs must therefore supply loose parts or in any case
parts that are only partially assembled, and this is a
hardly negligible drawback in the field.A device with the features set forth in the preamble of claim 1
is known from the document GB-A-972 460.Therefore, an aim of the present invention is to
provide a fixing device that allows to manufacture backs
that are already assembled and are ready to easily and
quickly compose chairs or the like in the combinations
desired by the dealer.A consequent primary object is to provide a device that
allows sturdy and reliable fixing.Another important object is to provide a fixing device 
which is simple to manufacture and has a low cost.This aim, these objects, and others which will become
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a device for fixing the
back of a chair or the like to the supporting structure,
according to the invention and as claimed in claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention
will become apparent from the following detailed description
of an embodiment thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a partially cutout view from below of a
back and of the support to which it is fixed;figure 2 is an enlarged-scale detail view of the
elements that compose the device during fixing;figure 3 is a partially sectional view of the elements
of the fixing device, coupled to each other;figure 4 is a partially sectional side view of the
fixing device;figure 5 is a view from below of the device during
fixing.With reference to the above figures, the back of a
chair is generally designated by the reference numeral 10
and is composed of an internal shaped supporting plate

<CLAIMS>
Device for fixing the back of a chair or the like to
the supporting structure comprising, at the end (15) of a

vertical portion of the support (16) of the back, two
oppositely arranged elastically retractable pins (17) which

are suitable to fit in corresponding seats (23) of shoulders
(24) which extend from the internal structure (11) of the

back (10), said end (15) being insertable between mutually
facing sides of said shoulders (24), characterized in that

said shoulders (24) comprise on said facing sides thereof
guiding channels for said pins (17), said guiding channels

divergingly extending along said sides from said seats (23)
downwardly to a region where said end (15) is insertable so

as to force said pins (17) to retract gradually while
guiding the end (15) upwards until the pins (17) are

received and locked in said seats (23).
Fixing device according to claim 1, characterized in
that said retractable pins (17) protrude from a transverse

through hole (18) of an element (19) which is fixed to said
end (15), said pins (17) having corresponding wider ends

(20) that are slideable in a wider median region of said
hole (18), a spring (22) being arranged between said wider

ends (20).
Fixing device according to claim 1, characterized in
that said shoulders (24) extend from a base (25) which is

fixed to the supporting structure (11) of the back.
Fixing device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said element (19)

which is fixed to said end (15) is locked at an inclined

face defining a stop element of said support (16). 
Fixing device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that an elastic wing (27)

rises from said base (25) in the region where said end (15)
of said support rests, said wing (27) constituting a

springing element for said back (10).
Fixing device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said end (15) of the

support of the back is made of metal and has a U-shaped
cross-section, said pins (17) protruding between

longitudinal slotted holes (15a) of the wings of said end
(15) of the support.
Fixing device according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said base (25) is

concealed by a covering shell (13) and can be accessed, for
the insertion of said end (15) of the support, through a

corresponding opening (14) of said shell.
