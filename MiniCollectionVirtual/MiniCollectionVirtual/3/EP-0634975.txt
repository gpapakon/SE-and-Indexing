<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the paper feed
mechanism for a multiple color rotary offset printing
press, and in particular, to a gripper bar conveyor
mechanism for paper transfer and registration from one
impression cylinder to another.Rotary offset printing machines have been used for
a number of years. The basic mechanisms, principles, and
steps of operation for modern rotary printers include
chemically forming an image on a thin metal image plate.
The thin image plate therearound is attached around the
circumference of a plate cylinder. Ink and a water
solution are applied by rollers to the respective
chemically treated areas that are to form an image on the
image plate as it rotates with the plate cylinder. The
plate cylinder rolls the image plate against a blanket
cylinder offsetting a reverse image around the
circumference of the blanket cylinder. A sheet of print
paper or other material to be printed is fed into the
press and gripped by an impression cylinder. The
impression cylinder pulls the paper into rolling contact
between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder. 
Under rolling pressure between the two cylinders, the
image is imprinted from the blanket cylinder onto the
paper. The imprinted image is the reverse of that on the
blanket cylinder so that it is appears as originally
formed on the image plate. After the paper is imprinted,
it is removed from the impression cylinder gripper and
transferred either to a collection tray if printing is
finished, or to another impression cylinder, if
additional colors or images are to be applied. The
subsequent impression cylinder grips the print paper from
a transfer gripper and rolls the paper against a
subsequent blanket cylinder for additional printing.In multi-color offset printers, each color is
applied as a series of minute dots or patterns. It is
extremely important to precisely locate or register the
paper as it is gripped by each of the impression
cylinders, so that each subsequent matrix of colored dots
can be properly located and coordinated with respect to
other color dots to form the desired image. Quality
printing requires precise location of the dots within
thousandths of an inch of each other. An error in
alignment of a few thousandths of an inch can produce a
blurred image or an image with improperly mixed and
overlapping color dots.In the past, multiple color offset rotary printers
accomplished this precise registration through careful
attention to the transfer of the paper using precisely
manufactured fixed diameter
