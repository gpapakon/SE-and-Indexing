<ABSTRACT>
A gene promoter sequence has been isolated and characterised from the plant gene encoding the enzyme cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), an enzyme which participates in the biosynthesis of lignins. The promoter may be used to control expression of exogenous genes placed under its control. Genes controlled by the CAD promoter are inducible by wounding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
regulation of gene expression in transgenic plants.
In particular it is concerned with the isolation
and use of DNA sequences which control the
expression of
cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase.The ability to isolate and manipulate plant
genes has opened the way to gain understanding
about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of
plant gene expression. This knowledge is important
for the exploitation of genetic engineering
techniques to practical problems such as the
expression of genes in genetically manipulated crop
plants exhibiting improved quality and production
characteristics.Many examples have been reported in the
literature of plant DNA sequences which have been
used to drive the expression of foreign genes in
plants. In most instances the regions immediately
5' to the coding regions of genes have been used in
gene constructs. These regions are referred to as
promoter sequences. They may be derived from plant
DNA; or from other sources, eg, viruses. It has
been demonstrated that sequences up to 500-1000
bases in most instances are sufficient to allow for
the regulated expression of foreign genes. The 
types of regulation exemplified include tissue-specificity,
regulation by external factors such as
light, heat treatment, chemicals, hormones, and
developmental regulation. However, it has also
been shown that sequences much longer than 1 kb may
have useful features which permit high levels of
gene expression in transgenic plants.These experiments have largely been carried
out using gene fusions between the promoter
sequences and foreign structural genes such as
bacterial genes, etc. This has led to the
identification of useful promoter sequences.In the work leading to the present invention
we have identified a gene which expresses an enzyme
involved in biosynthesis of lignin in vascular
plants. We have shown that this gene encodes
cimmamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) which is one
of the enzymes specific to the lignin branch
pathway of phenylpropanoid metabolism. The gene in
question is encoded by the cDNA clone pTCAD19 among
others which are the subject of our published
copending International Patent Application Number
WO 93/05159.The enzyme encoded by the CAD gene catalyses
the oxidation of cinnamyl aldehydes to cinnamyl
alcohols which are the direct precursors of the
lignin polymer. We have isolated the gene encoding
this enzyme from tobacco.We have shown that CAD mRNA is expressed
throughout plant development with the highest
levels found in lignifying
