<ABSTRACT>
A freezer having a freezing compartment and a porous conveyor belt for 
conveying articles through the freezing compartment. A vaporizer is provided to 

vaporize a stream of liquid cryogen. Vaporized cryogen is directed against the 
belt as a plurality of jets to blow accumulated ice off the belt. The vaporizer is 

located within the freezing compartment so that the cooling potential of the 
cryogen is not wasted and the vaporizer can serve as a preferential 

condensation site for the moisture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a freezer in which articles to be refrigerated 
pass through the freezer on a porous belt. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a cryogenic freezer in which the articles are refrigerated by 
nitrogen vapour being circulated through the belt and within the freezer. Even 
more particularly, the present invention relates to such a cryogenic freezer in 
which a bed of the article to be frozen is fluidized on the belt. Industrial freezers incorporate a porous belt on which articles to be refrigerated 
are conducted through a freezing compartment from an inlet to an outlet of the 
freezing compartment. Various means are provided to produce refrigeration 
within the freezing compartment including the use of liquid and gaseous 
cryogens formed from liquefied carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The refrigeration is 
typically provided for cryogenic freezers by spraying a liquid cryogen into the 
freezing compartment through spray nozzles. Cryogenic vapour produced 
through the introduction of the liquid cryogen into the freezing compartment is 
circulated to refrigerate the articles. In a fluidized bed freezer, the cryogenic 
vapour is circulated with a sufficient velocity to fluidize a bed of articles to be 
frozen, passing through the freezer on the porous belt. In prior art cryogenic freezers, some air enters the freezing compartment along 
with the articles to be frozen. The air contains moisture and such moisture 
freezes and accumulates on the belt as ice. Very often, food is frozen that has 
significant amount of moisture on its surface. Moisture released from the food 
will also enter the freezing compartment to accumulate on the belt as ice. In a 
fluidized bed freezer this is particularly troublesome in that the belt loses its 
porosity and therefore, the freezer loses its effectiveness. Prior art methods for cleaning ice from the belt have included wire brushes to 
scrape off the ice and routing the belt outside of the freezer where a forced flow  
 
of ambient air is used to defrost the belt. These methods suffer from being 
either unreliable, overly complex, and/or thermally inefficient. Another method 
of belt cleaning in cryogenic freezers has been the introduction of externally 
vaporized cryogen into the freezer in the form of gas jets directed toward the 
belt. This method, however, is wasteful of the cryogen because the energy 
added to vaporize the cryogen represents wasted cooling potential. Furthermore, US-A-4075869 discloses a freezer with liquid
