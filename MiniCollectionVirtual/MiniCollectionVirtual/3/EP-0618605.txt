<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing rod-shaped (stick-shaped) or cylindrical structures in the nm range of a silicon substrate (1), wherein a first cylinder (3) of silicon is selectively epitaxially grown in the hole of an oxide masking layer (2), the masking layer (2) is removed, the silicon is oxidised into an oxide layer (4) of such a thickness (d) that, from the first cylinder (3) with height (h), a thinner second cylinder (5) with practically the same height (H) remains, and wherein, in a final step, this oxide layer (4) is removed so that the second cylinder (5) forms a bare silicon rod on the surface of the substrate (1).

Method for producing cylindrical silicon structures 
in the nm range on a silicon substrate (1), in 

which: in a first step, a mask layer (2) having a hole 
with circular outline with a diameter that is suitable in 

regard to the subsequent fourth step, is produced on this 
substrate (1); in a second step, a first silicon 

cylinder (3) is deposited in this hole; in a third step, 
this mask layer (2) is removed at least in a region 

around this first cylinder (3); in a fourth step, the 
surface of the silicon is oxidized to an extent such that 

a second silicon cylinder (5), with the intended 
diameter (D) and the intended height (H) remains of the 

first silicon cylinder (3); and, in a fifth step, this 
oxidized silicon is removed at least in a region around 

this second cylinder (5). 
Method according to Claim 1, in which the hole in 
the mask layer (2) has a diameter of between 0.05 µm and 

0.5 µm. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, for producing 
a triode structure, in which: in the first step, the mask 

layer (2) produced is covered by a thin cover layer (6) 
that is open in the region of the hole, and the materials 

of these layers (2, 6) are selected in such a way that 
this mask layer (2) can be etched selectively relative to 

this cover layer (6) and relative to the silicon; in 
which the third step is carried out in such a way that a 

proportion of this cover layer (6) that is sufficient for 
a further fourth step remains; in which the fourth step 

is carried out in such a way that the oxidized silicon 
with the remaining proportion of the cover layer (6)  

 
forms a surface that is sufficiently planar for a 

subsequent step; in which, in a consecutive further 
fourth step, a heavily doped layer (7) which is provided 

as the gate electrode and is made of a material that can 
be etched selectively relative to silicon, is applied; 

and in which the fifth step is carried out by etching 
through this heavily doped layer (7). 
Method according to Claim 3, in which the mask 
layer (2) is an oxide and the cover layer (6) is a 

nitride. 
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, in which, in 
the further fourth step, the heavily doped polysilicon 

layer (7) is applied and an insulator layer (8) of an 
oxide is applied thereon.
