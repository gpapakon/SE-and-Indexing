<ABSTRACT>
A signal processor with a simplified circuit 
configuration provides an improved processing speed 

and can be realized of small size and at inexpensive 
cost. The signal processor includes signal holding 

means for holding output signals from plural signal 
sources (S1 - S4), and signal mixing means (M31 - M34) 

for mixing at least two signals among the plural signals 
held to output plural mixed signals. Since the mixed 

signals are less than the signal sources in number, 
the small number of signal lines can lead to an 

increased processing speed. Then the mixed signals 
corresponding to discrete signals from plural signal 

sources enables processing without substantially 
destroying information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
processor for processing plural signals and used for
information storage devices, photoelectric converters,
and the like.In image sensors and semiconductor memory
devices, typically, read-only memories (ROMs) a X-Y
address system configuration is employed, where a shift
register performs a vertical scanning operation and a
horizontal scanning operation to output sequentially
chronologically externally output signals from signal
sources such as memory cells and photo cells.An exemplary explanation will be made
of a conventional signal processor. Fig. 1 is a
circuit diagram showing the conventional signal
processor. Fig. 2 is a drive timing chart for the
conventional signal processor.Referring now to Fig. 1, signal sources S1, S2,
S3, and S4 are typical photo cells each for outputting
a voltage. The photo signals are chronologically
outputted to the output line 5 via N-type MOS
transistors M11, M12, ... M14, M21, M22 ... M24 acting
as switching elements, and capacitance elements C11, 
C12 ... C14 acting as signal holding means.First when a pulse applied to the terminal 1
rises up at the time t0, the photo signals for the
cells M11 to M14 are read out and held to the
capacitance elements C11 to C14, respectively. Then
when the pulse applied to the terminal 1 falls down,
the scanning circuit 11 starts to operate. A selection
pulse is outputted to the signal line L1 at the time t2.
At this time, the signal held in the capacitance
element C11 is outputted to the terminal 12 via the
signal line 5 and the output amplifier 10.Then when the pulse on the signal line L1 falls
down and the reset pulse is applied to the terminal 2
at the time t4, the output line 5 is reset to the reset
reference potential of the terminal 3.Similarly, the output operation and the reset
operation are repeated for the remaining signal sources
S2 to S4. Thus signals which are read out in parallel
from the signal sources S1 to S4 and then held in the
capacitance elements C11 to C14 are converted into
time series signals.In an actual signal processor, the signal
sources are over 100 in number, and is recently over
100 thousands in number.Hence even if the reading time per signal
source is short, it is limited to reduce the time
necessary to output signals from all signal sources 
as time series signals.On the other hand, in many cases, when photo
cells are used as the signal sources, the signals
from the signal sources are output as visible images.
In such images the case may occur where a bright
