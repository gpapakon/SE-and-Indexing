<ABSTRACT>
In a flat panel autostereoscopic display full resolution equal to the number of pixels in the two-dimensional light valve array, which serves to generate images, is achieved by incorporating an illumination system (40-47) which makes use of stroboscopic light 5 sources or continuously lit light sources in combination with electro-optical shutter means (56). The lighting system when used in conjuction with a 2-D flat panel display, achieves image resolution exceeding several times the pixel resolution of the light valve array.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to illumination systems designed
to improve image resolution and permit look-around viewing
in liquid crystal and similar flat panel transmissive
three dimensional (3-D) displays and enhanced resolution and
color two dimensional (2-D) displays, for use in computers,
television and the like viewing apparatus.Several display systems are on the market today which
are capable of generating three-dimensional images based on
the use of stereopairs, i.e., complementary images, which
when directed to the appropriate eye of the observer,
produce a perception of three-dimensionality. Two of such 
systems, one made by Stereographics, Inc., the other by
Tektronix Corp., utilize cathode ray tubes in conjunction
with liquid crystal light valves designed to direct the
appropriate half of the stereopair to the left or right eye
of the observer. Both of these systems require the observer
to wear special glasses. In addition, in order to achieve
full resolution, these displays operate at frame rate twice
the standard television (TV) scanning rates.A third system made by Dimension Technologies Inc. is
autostereoscopic, i.e., it permits the observer to perceive
3-D without the need to wear glasses. The system uses a
transmissive image generating liquid crystal panel (LCD) and
is disclosed in US-A- 4,717,949; 4,829,365 and 5,040,878. In
this system a multiplicity of parallel, equidistant, thin,
bright, vertical light lines is generated using an optical
device termed the "reflection plate" which carries on its
one surface opposite the planar surface facing the LCD, a
series of parallel ridges equal in numbers to the number of
said light lines. The ridges, triangular in cross-section,
are designed to intercept light rays tangentially projected
by a cylindrical lens onto said ridge-bearing surface of
said reflection plate from a linearly configured light
source disposed on the vertical side of the LCD. This method
for generating a lattice of lines is specifically described
in US-A-5,040,878. An image-generating LCD is situated
parallel to and in front of a reflection plate, separated by
a small fixed distance of, say, 3 mm, such that the
observer, due to the parallax effect of vision, sees with
his left eye the light lines through the odd-numbered pixel
columns of the LCD, and the even-numbered pixel columns with
his right eye. Thus, an illusion of depth is created,
albeit by sacrificing one half of the pixel resolution in
the 3-D image.Other examples of autostereoscopic display systems are disclosed
in
