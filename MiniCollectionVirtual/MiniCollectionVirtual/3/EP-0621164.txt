<ABSTRACT>
Doubledeck coach with entry and exit doors (2) on both sides at both ends, an upper and a lower passenger compartment, with doors to the passenger compartments and wagon-intercommunicating doors (3) at both ends of the coach. The access to the passenger compartments in the lower deck and upper deck (5,(4)) is provided from the entry or exit vestibule (9) through a single access door (6) which is arranged between the entry or exit vestibule (9) and an intermediate floor (10). From the intermediate floor (10), the upper and lower passenger compartments can be reached via a descending stair (8) or an ascending stair (7). The intermediate floor (10) has the function of providing safety and comfort. The safety feature is that the access door is not positioned directly in front of or behind a staircase and the comfort feature is that the ascent from the lower deck (5) to the upper deck is interrupted with this intermediate floor (10). The short descending stair (8) to the passenger compartment in the lower deck (5) is replaced in one design variant with an arcuate, wheelchair-compatible ramp. In an "economy" design, a multi-functional staircase column is provided between the stairs.
