<ABSTRACT>
Heavy metals are efficiently removed from contaminated soil by a process which comprises leaching or washing the soil with a mild leachant solution comprised of an aqueous solution of an acid and a salt. Heavy metals are also efficiently removed from paint chips by washing with an aqueous acid. The heavy metals are recovered from the leachant by cementation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a process for removing heavy 
metals from soil and paint chips. The removal of heavy metal contaminants from soils 
represents a major contemporary environmental problem. 
Heavy metal pollution can leave the affected ground 
unusable for agricultural or residential purposes, and the 
metals can eventually leach into the groundwater system and 
lead to more widespread problems. While a number of soil 
classification or solidification/stabilization techniques 
which leave the offending metals in the soil have been 
developed, only removal of the metals actually solves the 
problem by removing the cause. Several attempts to remove 
metals from soils have been reported but none have been 
completely successful. One such method is described in 
Draft Report to the EPA, Contract No. 68-03-3255, US EPA, 
Emergency Response Branch, Edison , NJ, 1986 and CSIRO  
 
Aust. Div. Soils Tech. Pap. No. 41, 1979, 1-17 wherein the 
extracted metals which were bound to clay and humic 
materials were removed with a strong complexing agent such 
as EDTA. However, the EDTA remained in the wetted soil 
causing the treated soil to fail the TCLP test of the EPA 
for extractable metals. Sci. Total Environ. 1989, 79, 253-270;

J. Soil Sci. 1969, 49, 327-334; and Plant Soil 1973, 38, 
605-619 teach the use of aqueous acetic acid or ammonium 
acetate solutions as extractants. This method resulted in 
only slight leaching of metals from the soil. EP 278,328 
(1988); Environ. Prog. 1990, 9, 79-86; EP 377,766 (1990); 
and Chemiker-Zeitung 1982, 106, 289-292 teach the use of 
strongly acidic leachant solutions such as HCl. This method 
leads to substantial (ca. 30%) dissolution of soil 
components and requires extensive basification of each HCl 
extract and/or the washed soil. DE 3,703,922 and DE 
3,705,519 teach that isolation of the metal values is 
often impossible due to the metals having been precipitated 
as sulfides. EP 291,746 and SU 1,444,377 teach that 
complete separation of the soil and aqueous phases in an 
extraction process is difficult. J. Indian Chem. Soc.,
