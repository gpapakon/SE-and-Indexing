<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel magnetisable lustre pigments comprising plateletlike, nonferromagnetic, metallic substrates coated with   A) a first, ferromagnetic layer comprising iron, cobalt and/or nickel, and if desired   B1) a further layer, this time comprising a metal oxide, and/or B2) an outer, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- and/or vanadate-containing layer, mixtures thereof with coated silicatic platelets, and the preparation and use of the pigments.

<CLAIMS>
Magnetizable luster pigments comprising platelet-shaped, 
nonferromagnetic, metallic substrates coated with 


A) a first, ferromagnetic layer comprising iron, cobalt 
and/or nickel, and if desired 
B1) a further layer, this time comprising a metal oxide, 
and/or 
B2) an outer, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- and/or 
vanadate-containing layer. 
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
nonferromagnetic, metallic substrate consists essentially 

of aluminum. 
Magnetizable luster pigment mixtures comprising 

I) the luster pigments of claim 1 or 2, and 
II) silicatic platelets coated with a ferromagnetic, 
iron-, cobalt- and/or nickel-containing layer and if 

desired an additional metal oxide layer and/or an 
outer, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- and/or 

vanadate-containing layer, with or without a first 
layer of metal oxide underneath, 
 
as essential components. 
A process for preparing the luster pigments of 
claim 1 or 2, which comprises coating the metallic 

substrate in a fluidized bed with 

a) a first, ferromagnetic, iron-, cobalt- and/or 
nickel-containing layer, by gas phase decomposition 

of iron, cobalt and/or nickel carbonyls in the 
presence of an inert gas, and subsequently, if 

desired, with 
b1) a further layer, this time of a metal oxide, by gas 
phase decomposition of volatile metal compounds in  

 
the presence of oxygen and/or water vapor, and/or 

with 
b2) an additional, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- 
and/or vanadate-containing layer by gas phase decomposition 

of vaporizable phosphorus, chromium 
and/or vanadium compounds in the presence of water 

vapor. 
A process for preparing the luster pigment 
mixtures of claim 3, which comprises coating the metallic 

substrate and the uncoated or already metal oxide-coated 
silicatic platelets conjointly in a fluidized bed with 


a) a first, ferromagnetic, iron-, cobalt- and/or 
nickel-containing layer, by gas phase decomposition 

of iron, cobalt and/or nickel carbonyls in the 
presence of an inert gas, and subsequently, if 

desired, with 
b1) a further layer, this time of a metal oxide, by gas 
phase decomposition of volatile metal compounds in 

the presence of oxygen and/or water vapor, and/or 
with 
b2) an additional, passivating, phosphate-, chromate- 
and/or vanadate-containing layer by gas phase decomposition 

of vaporizable phosphorus, chromium 
and/or vanadium compounds in the presence of water 

vapor. 
A process for coloring paints, printing inks, 
plastics, glasses and ceramic products, which comprises 

using the luster pigments of any of claims 1 to 3. 
A process as claimed in claim 6 additionally 
comprising exposing the luster pigments to a magnetic 

field during or after application in the still liquid 
application medium. 
A process as claimed in claim 6 or 7 for producing 
3D effects in security printing.
