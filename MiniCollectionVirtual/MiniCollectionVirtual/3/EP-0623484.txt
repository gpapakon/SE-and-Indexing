<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a bearing device, in particular for pivotably mounted sun visors of vehicles, having a spindle (6), one end portion of which can be connected to the vehicle and around the other end portion of which, which can be inserted into a bearing body (5) of the sun-visor body (1), the sun-visor body (1) can be pivoted between a first and a second end position, and having a latching device, which has a spring (17), latches the sun-visor body (1) non-positively to the spindle (6) in at least one position in the pivoting region and in its adjustment region produces a torque which is to be overcome in the event of an adjustment. In this connection, it is provided that the bearing body (5) has a bearing hole (10) with at least one radial, axially extending, channel-shaped widened portion (11), that that end portion of the spindle (6) which is inserted into the bearing hole (10) is designed with an axially extending groove (14) with closed ends and outwardly diverging groove walls (15), and that the spring (17), which is matched to the length of the groove, is inserted with pretension into the groove (14), the spring being composed of spring steel plate and having a U-shaped cross-section with limbs which converge towards the free ends and are supported against the groove walls (15).

Bearing device for pivotably mounted sun visors 
of vehicles, having a spindle (6), one end section of 

which can be connected to a vehicle, and it being possible 
for a sun-visor body (1) to be pivoted, between a 

first end position and a second end position, about the 
other end section, which can be inserted into a bearing 

body (5) of the sun-visor body (1), of said spindle, and 
having a latching device which has a spring (17), latches 

the sun-visor body (1) in a frictionally locking manner 
with the spindle (6) in at least one position of the 

pivot region, and produces, in its adjustment region, a 
torque which has to be overcome in the event of an 

adjustment, characterized in that the bearing body (5) 
has a bearing bore (10) with at least one radial, axially 

extending, channel-like widened portion (11), in that the 
end section of the spindle (6) which is inserted into the 

bearing bore (10) is designed with an axially extending 
groove (14) which has closed ends and outwardly diverging 

groove walls (15), and in that the groove (14) has 
inserted into it, with prestressing, the spring (17), 

which is adapted in length to said groove, consists of 
spring steel plates and has a U-shaped cross-section with 

legs which converge towards the free ends and are supported 
on the groove walls (15). 
Bearing device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the spring (17), which is U-shaped in cross-section, 

is provided with an axially extending bend in 
the web, which bend gives the web a gable-roof shape 

which matches the channel-like widened portion (11) of  
 

the bearing bore (10). 
Bearing device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the web of the spring (17) is supported 

by a protuberance (16), extending from the base of the 
groove (14), when the bend of the web is located outside 

the at least one channel-like widened portion (11) of the 
bearing bore (10). 
Bearing device according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the bearing body (5) 

consists of a wear-resistant plastic material and is 
designed as an injection moulding. 
Bearing device according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the bearing body (5) 

is arranged on a reinforcing insert (3) which stiffens 
the sun-visor body (1) and is designed as a plastic 

injection moulding. 
Bearing device according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the bearing body (5) 

is seated between two bearing eyelets (9) formed on the 
reinforcing insert (3), and is arranged on the reinforcing 

insert (3) via a plug-in connection. 
Bearing device according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the bearing body (5) 

has a region (12), designed as a two-armed fork, as a 
plug-in receiving means (13) for the plug-in connection 

which is to be produced with the reinforcing insert (3).
