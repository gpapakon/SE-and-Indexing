<ABSTRACT>

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved combination
expansion device and flow distributor unit for use in a
reverse cycle (heat pump) air conditioning system.A combination expansion device and flow distributor
unit according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,643,222 which issued in
the name of Wise. A free floating piston is mounted
within a housing which is arranged to close against the
entrance of a passageway when refrigerant moves in one
direction between a pair of multiple circuit heat
exchangers. The piston contains a metering orifice
through which refrigerant is throttled when the piston is
in a closed position. The throttled refrigerant, which is
in both the vapor phase and liquid phase, is discharged
into an axially-aligned, drilled hole. A series of
distributor channels are each passed at an acute angle
into the distal end of the drilled hole. The axial length
of the hole is extremely short and, as a consequence, the
refrigerant vapor phase will not mix homogeneously with
the vapor phase before the mixture enters the distributor
channels. By the same token, because of the shallow
entrance angle to the distributor channels, unequal
amounts of refrigerant mixture can be discharged into each
channel unless the flow directing surfaces are precisely
machined. Accordingly, the performance of the individual
downstream heat exchanger circuits will be adversely
effected.High precision distributors are available which are
capable of more evenly distributing refrigerant into a
multiple circuit heat exchanger. These devices, however,
are relatively complex and expensive. Despite the use of
precision parts, the distribution of refrigerant is
oftentimes non-homogeneous and uneven. For the most part,
these precision distributors are not applicable for use in
reverse cycle systems. It is therefor an object of the present
invention to improve heat pump systems by providing an
improved combination expansion device and refrigerant
distributor unit that is capable of uniformly
distributing a homogeneous mixture of vapor phase and
liquid phase refrigerant to the circuits of a multiple
circuit heat exchanger.A further object of the present invention is
to provide an expansion device and flow distributor unit
for use in a heat pump that can deliver high efficiency
performance regardless of the units mounted position.Another object of the present invention is
to provide a combination piston-equipped, expansion
device suitable for use in a heat pump that is equipped
with a high performance flow
