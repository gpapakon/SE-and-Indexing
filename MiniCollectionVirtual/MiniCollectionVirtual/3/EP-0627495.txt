<ABSTRACT>
A protective composite thin film coating structure (21 
or 45) is disclosed which provides ultraviolet (UV)-protection 

to polymer components (22) used in low earth orbit (LEO) 
environments. The structure (23, 24) protects such components 

from physical and optical degradation due to exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation and oxygen, in particular atomic oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ultraviolet (UV)-protected polymer
components useful in low earth orbit (LEO) environments and to coatings for protecting
such components from physical and optical degradation due to exposure to ultraviolet
radiation and oxygen, in particular atomic oxygen.Flexible polymer film components are useful, for example, in photovoltaic
arrays which are used in satellites and other spacecraft. However, in the LEO
environment, these polymer components are subject to physical and optical degradation
by exposure to atomic oxygen and to ultraviolet radiation.The current art for protecting such polymer components (also called
substrates here) is to apply a silicon oxide monolayer barrier coating to the front and back
surfaces of the substrate by wet chemical deposition or physical vapor deposition (PVD)
in a vacuum. However, silicon oxide barrier layers, especially those formed on flexible
substrates, are subject to cracks and brittle fracture damage due to intrinsic coating stress
and/or assembly and handling. Furthermore. the protective barrier coating may be
scratched or otherwise abraded. Unavoidably, there are particle inclusions which can
become fracture points. Also, coated polymers exhibit pinhole defects caused by the
polymer surface topology prior to thin film coating. Defects such as cracks, fractures,
scratches, particle inciusions and pin holes have been demonstrated to be the starting
points of catastrophic mechanical failure due to exposed polymer etching and barrier
undercutting by atomic oxygen of the polymer film substrate during long term LEO space
exposure.The transactions of 21st Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering
Conference,1986, at Vol. 3, pp. 2032-38, US-A-4980206 and US-A-4560577
disclose using metaloxide or organo-silicone for protecting polymer substrates
against UV and oxygen in space orbit. FIGS 1-3 depict schematically the harmful effects
of such defects on a polymer substrate 10 having a
single layer, silicon oxide barrier coating 11. FIG.
1 illustrates a particle inclusion 12, a void 13 and a
through crack 14 in the barrier coating 11. The
particle inclusion results in a so-called particle
break-out indicated at 16, FIG. 2. Referring also to
FIG. 3, the particle break-out, void and crack allow
oxygen in the ambient to penetrate to and etch the
underlying polymer substrate 10, resulting in the void
undercutting shown at 17 (that is, erosion by oxygen
of the polymer substrate 10 beneath the void); crack
undercutting, indicated at 18; and
