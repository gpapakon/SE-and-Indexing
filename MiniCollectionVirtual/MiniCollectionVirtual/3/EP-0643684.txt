<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a method for removing iodine compounds from acetic acid, in which the iodine compound is removed by using a solid adsorbent in the form of an activated carbon fiber having a large strength, a large bulk density, and a large specific surface, so that the treatment of large amounts should be possible, that the acetic acid should not be contaminated during the extraction of foreign materials from the adsorbent, and that the adsorbent can be repeatedly used by regenerating it. The method includes the steps of: preparing a filter in the usual manner by using an activated carbon fiber as the adsorbent; and making acetic acid containing an iodide pass through the activated carbon fiber filter, whereby the iodide in acetic acid is removed by being adsorbed by the activated carbon fiber filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for removing 
iodine compounds, which is applicable to the process for 
preparing acetic acid. Particularly, the present 
invention relates to a method for removing iodine compound 
by using activated carbon fibers as the adsorbent. Generally, in the case where acetic acid is prepared 
based on the methanol carbonylation reaction, the iodine 
compound is used as the reaction promoting agent in the 
form of methyl or hydrogen iodide (CH3I or HI). The iodide which is used as the reaction promoting 
agent is mostly recovered by distillation. However, usually the iodine compound remains in the 
form of iodine ions I- , iodine molecules I2, or alkyl 
iodine (particularly methyl iodine) in small amounts of 
several or several scores ppm. In the case where acetic acid in which such small 
amount of iodine compound remains is used as the raw 
material, if the catalyst is very sensitive to the small 
amount of the iodine compound, the concentration of the 
iodine compound used as the raw material has to be lowered 
to an extremely small amount (several scores ppb) so as for 
the iodine compound to be suitable to the process. Thus it is required that the concentration of the 
iodine compound remaining in the acetic acid be lowered to 
an extremely low level. As the conventional iodine or iodine compound (to be 
called iodides) removing methods, there are a oxidation 
method (U.S. Patent 3,709,705), a method using chemicals 
as a scavenger (U.S. Patents 4,246,195 and 4,664,753), a 
hydrogenation method (U.S. Patent 4,792,420), a 
distillation method (U.S. Patent 4,029,553), and a 
crystallizing method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho-50-126610).  
 In these methods, although there are some differences, 
the cost for the distillation or the cost for the chemical 
salts constitutes the major expenses, thereby making them 
uneconomical. Further, the regeneration of the chemical 
salts used is difficult. Meanwhile, there is known a method in which the iodine 
compound is removed by using a solid adsorbent. This 
method is different from the above cited methods, and has 
an advantage that the expense for the distillation and the 
expense of the chemical substance can be saved. The typical methods are: the method using ion exchange 
resin (U.S. Patent 3,943,229 and DE-A-3248654), the method using zeolite 
with a metal supported therein (U.S. Patent 4,088,737), the 
method using silica with a metal supported therein (U.S. 
Patent 3,838,554), the method using a ceramic with 
trie
