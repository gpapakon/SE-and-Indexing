<ABSTRACT>
A biodegradable and biocompatible polycarbonate comprising (C3-10) alkylene carbonic acid ester units, each alkylene group being a C3-alkylene group having 1 oxy substituent or a (C4-10) alkylene group having 2-8 oxy substituents, each of the oxy substituents occurring individually as a hydroxyl group or as a derivatized hydroxyl group comprising an ester or an ortho ester or an acetal residue. The polycarbonates may be used as matrices for the sustained release of pharmacologically active compounds, e.g. peptides or proteins, in the form of microparticles or implants.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIODEGRADABLE POLYCARBONATES AND THEIR USE AS DRUG CARRIERSThe invention relates to biodegradable and biocαπpatible polyesters and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.The function of the polyesters in the pharmaceutical ccπpositions is to control the rate of the release of pharmacologically active compounds from the compositions and the duration of the activity in the animal body to which the compositions are administered.Although we do not wish to bound by any theory, it is believed that when administered to the body the polyesters can initially screen off the pharmacologically active compounds from the aqueous media, present in the body, whereafter due to biodegradation of the polyesters or to diffusion of the drug compounds through the polyesters, the drug releases and becomes medically active. This may be an interesting mechanism e.g. when the polyesters are water insoluble.In the compositions the drug compound may also be chemically bound to the polyesters, whereafter due to biodegradation of the polyester molecule part, the drug releases from the compositions. This may be an interesting mechanism e.g. when the polyesters are water soluble and the polyester - drug compound combination functions as a water soluble pre-drug.Dependent on the type of release mechanism the drug cαπ-pound can be set free e.g. within one or more hours or days if chemically bound to polyesters or within one or more days, weeks or months if screened off by the polyesters. 

The invention provides biodegradable, bioco patible polyesters comprising (C3--10) alkylene carbonic acid ester units, each alkylene group being a C3-alkylene group having 1 oxy substituent or a (C _ιo) alkylene group having 2-8 oxy substituents, each of the oxy substi¬ tuents occurring independently as a hydroxyl group, or as a moiety independently comprising an ester or an ortho ester or an acetal group.Thus the polymers may contain e.g. mixtures of different oxy substitutents. Preferably the oxy substituents are the same. Representative compounds may contain however a hydroxyl group and an oxy substituent, e.g. up to 30 or 20% hydroxyl groups.The polyesters of carbonic acid are in principle biodegradable since their back bone chains contain carbonic acid esters bonds -0-C(=0)-0- which are hydrolysable in the human body's aqueous media, at suitable pH, e.g. in the presence of hydrolytic enzymes, e.g. esterases. Polyesters containing carbonic acid ester groups are generally known as rather stable polymeric materials. Exceptions reported so
