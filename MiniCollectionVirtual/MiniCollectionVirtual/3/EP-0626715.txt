<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a light source, in particular a glow lamp (12) for insertion in a pin base (plug cap) (14), in particular for use in electrical devices (16) such as electrical switches, push-button switches, dimmers and the like, having a hollow body (20) with electrodes which are arranged therein and whose connecting wires (25, 26) are passed out at the bottom (22) of the hollow body (20) in a fashion insulated with respect to one another and serve as connecting contacts (27, 28) for matching contacts (19) located in the pin base (14), and having a series resistor (30) which is inserted between the light source (12) and an electrical supply network, the series resistor (30) being directly connected to one of the connecting wires (26), which are passed out of the hollow body (20), and forming the connection to the associated matching contact (19) in the pin base (14).

Light source (10), in particular glow lamp,
having a T-shaped plug-in cap (14) for use in

electrical installation devices (16), such as
electrical switches, push-button switches, dimmers and

the like, with a cylindrical hollow element (20),

preferably made of glass, with electrodes which are
arranged therein and whose two connecting wires

(25, 26) are led out, insulated from one another, on a
side (22), facing the plug-in cap (14), of the hollow

element (20) and interact with terminal contacts
(18, 19) located in the plug-in cap (14), said light

source also having a bias resistor (30) which is
interconnected between the hollow element (20) and an

electrical supply network, the bias resistor (30) being
connected directly to one of the connecting wires (26)

which is led out of the hollow element (20) and forming
the connection to an assigned corresponding contact

(19) and the other connecting wire (25) being led
directly to the assigned terminal contact (19),

characterized in that the hollow element (20) is
provided on its side (22) facing the plug-in cap (14)

with a protective cap (24) which receives this side
(22) of the hollow element (20) and the adjoining bias

resistor (30) and thus forms a lamp component (12)
which, together with the plug-in cap (14), forms the

light source (10), in that the connecting wires
(25, 29), which interact with the terminal contacts

(18, 19), are led isolated from one another, from the
hollow element (20) and/or from the bias resistor (30) 

to the outside through the protective cap (24), and in
that the plug-in cap (14) is formed with a flat lower

part (36) which is used to receive contact lugs (18)
and corresponding contacts (19), and with a centrally

adjoining upper part (34) which is arranged
perpendicularly with respect to said lower part (36)

and which has latching projections arranged on it.
The light source as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that the lower part (36) of the plug-in

cap (14) is formed from a cover part (38) adjoining
the upper part (34) and a trough-shaped receptacle part

(39), which receptacle part (39) receives the cover
part (38) together with the conductors (18, 19)

arranged therein and is connected to said cover part
(38).
Light source according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the cover part (38) is connected

to the receptacle part (39) of the plug-in cap (14) by
means of a film hinge.
Light source according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the bias resistor (30) is

of cylindrical design with connecting wires (26, 29)
adjoining the end faces.
Light source according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the bias resistor (30) is a

commercially available carbon film resistor.
Light source according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the bias resistor (30) is a

commercially available metal film resistor.
Light source according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the protective cap (24) is formed

from insulating material.
Light source according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the protective cap (24) is

manufactured from thermoplastic which is capable of
being injection moulded. 
Light source according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the protective cap (24) is

adapted with its end facing away from the hollow
element (20) to the geometry of the plug-in cap (14)

and is designed so as to be insertable therein.
