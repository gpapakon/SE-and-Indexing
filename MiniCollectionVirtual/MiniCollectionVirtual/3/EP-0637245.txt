<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of various
fractions of hyaluronic acid as osteoinductive agents,
i.e., agents capable of stimulating the growth and
differentiation of bone forming cells, and therefore the
formation of new bone material itself. The type of
activity refers to cells of mammalian origin.An intricate network of macromolecules constituting
the extracellular matrix, a substantial part of the
tissue volume, largely fills the extracellular space. In
many tissues, such as connective tissues, it is
generally more abundant and completely surrounds the
cells on all sides, thus determining the physical
properties of the tissue. The extracellular matrix is of
considerable importance in regulating many processes of
tissue behavior. It has been demonstrated that changes
in the state and composition of the extracellular matrix
profoundly influence biosynthetic processes and tissue
development. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are the most plentiful
non-fibrous, extracellular macromolecules, and are
ubiquitous in all connective tissues. This group of high
molecular weight anionic glycoconjugates is present in
both the soft and mineralized connective tissues. They
are substantially composed of large molecules called
"non-collagenous proteins" (NCP) of the extracellular
matrix, or "proteoglycans". The first of these terms
distinguishes these molecules from the group of fibrous
proteins such as collagen, elastin, fibronectin and
laminin; the second indicates that they are usually
found to be covalently bound to protein.The biological properties of proteoglycans have
been the object of intense research, mainly with regard
to the soft tissues. The bone and cement, on the other
hand, have been virtually ignored as far as their
proteoglycan content is concerned. In fact, there is
only one report in existence which describes the
proteoglycans of the alveolar bone (R. J. Waddington et
al., Connective Tissue Res., 1988: 17, 171).GAGs are long, unbranched polysaccharide chains
composed of repetitive disaccharide units. The type of
sugar residues, their bonds, and the number and position
of the sulfate groups have led to the identification of
four main groups of GAGs: 1) hyaluronic acid, 2)
chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, 3) heparan
sulfate and heparin, and 4) keratan sulfate. It is
important to note that GAGs (with the probable exception
of hyaluronic acid) rarely exist in a free state within
tissues. They are usually covalently bound to proteins.With the exception of hyaluronic acid, GAGs contain
sulfat
