<ABSTRACT>
A roller bearing apparatus (10) including inner and outer 
rings (22;30) defining a pair of raceway spaces (38), 

a plurality of rollers (54) 
arranged in oppositely axially inclined rows each occupying one 

of the raceway spaces (38), and a guide member (86). The guide member (86) 
includes a ring (90) between the roller rows and oppositely extending 

shortened prongs or stubs (110;114) 
extending only a short distance between 

the rollers (54) so as not to take up space that otherwise could be 
used for one or more additional rollers. The pocket bottoms are 

angled to skew the rollers to promote roller precession or 
indexing. Alternatively, the guide member can include a reduced 

number of larger prongs to replace one or more of the stubs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to roller bearings, and
more particularly to roller guides such as retainers and guide
rings used in roller bearings to hold and position rolling
elements.Examples of self-aligning angular contact roller
bearings are provided in U.S. Patent No. 2,387,962 issued
September 28, 1942, U.S. Patent No. 2,767,037 issued October 16,
1956, and U.S. Patent No. 4,557,613 issued December 10, 1985. In
each of those patents the illustrated roller bearing includes an
inner ring that provides a substantially spherical inner race
surface, an outer ring having a pair of outer race surfaces with
convex curvatures, and a pair of oppositely axially inclined rows
of symmetrical, hourglass-shaped rollers. Another example of an
angular contact roller bearing is illustrated in U.S. Patent No.
3,912,346 issued October 14, 1975. That roller bearing includes
oppositely axially inclined rows of symmetrical, barrel-shaped
rollers.The foregoing roller bearings also include roller cages
or retainers to separate, guide and position the rollers in each
row. Each of the retainers includes a set of axially extending
webs or prongs that circumferentially separate the rollers in one
of the rows and a set of oppositely axially extending prongs that
circumferentially separate the rollers in the other row. A 
disadvantage associated with known roller retainers such as those
used in the aforementioned patents is that they fully separate
the rollers and occupy space within the bearing unit and between
the rollers that could otherwise be used for additional rollers
and/or additional lubricant.Additionally, loads exerted on a bearing unit such as
one of those described above are typically carried by the rollers
in only one part of the unit at a time, that part being referred
to as the "load zone". Especially where bearings are used in
oscillatory applications, it is desired that the rollers in the
bearing unit precess or index so that they are cycled through the
load zone. Cycling the rollers results in utilization of the
entire race surface of each of the rollers to extend rolling
contact fatigue life. Cycling the rollers also redistributes
lubrication within the bearing unit which in turn reduces
fretting damage and improves the bearing unit's resistance to
raceway corrosion. To cause such precessing or indexing of the
rollers, it is known to use a retainer as described above but
with prongs that define skewed roller pockets. In one known
retainer design the prongs are inclined at an angle of about 4Â°
to provide

rollers (54) arranged in an axially inclined annular row in the raceway space (38),

each of the rollers (54) in the annular row including opposite first and second end
portions (58 and 62), and a guide member (86, 130, 134, 136, 138 or 150) including a

ring (90) and a plurality of prongs (110;114) extending axially from the ring (90) to
circumferentially separate said first end portions (58) of respective pairs of rollers (54)

rollers (54) in the annular row contacts adjacent ones of the rollers (54) in the annular

row.
A roller bearing apparatus as set forth in claim 1. wherein each of the prongs
(110; 114) extends between the first end portions (58) of a respective pair of rollers

(54) to thereby separate said first end portions (58) circumferentially.
A roller bearing apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said inner
and outer ring members (22 and 30) define therebetween a pair of axially spaced apart

and oppositely axially inclined raceway spaces (38), wherein a plurality of rollers (54)
is arranged in oppositely axially inclined annular rows, each of the annular rows of

rollers (54) being positioned in one of the raceway spaces (38), and each of the rollers
(54) in each of the annular rows including a first end portion (58), and a second end

portion (62), the second end portion (62) of each of the rollers (54) in each of the

plurality of second prongs (114) extending from the ring (90) in a second axial
direction opposite the first axial direction, each of the second prongs (114) extending
