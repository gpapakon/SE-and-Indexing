<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a simulator of predominantly electrical fields of the damped sinusoidal type, and the application of this simulator to tests of electrical or electronic equipment. The operating principle of the simulator according to the invention rests on the directly-connected or magnetically coupled injection of a pulsed electrical signal generated by means (1) onto an elongate and resonant structure (3) extending parallel at a distance d from a conducting earth plane (2) and over a total length L. At the free end (30) of this structure, a predominant electric field is generated by resonance, the field being of the damped sinusoidal type, the frequency, maximum level and damping coefficients of which depend mainly on the distance d, on the length L and on the material used for the structure. The equipment to be tested is then directly linked as close as possible to the free end (30) of the structure (3). The simulator which is the subject of the invention is particularly advantageous in use as a test facility for equipment intended to be installed in conducting structures of large dimensions subjected to pulsed electromagnetic attacks.
