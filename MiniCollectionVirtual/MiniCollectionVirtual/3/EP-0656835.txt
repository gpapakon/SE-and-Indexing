<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns mouldings (1) with longitudinal capillary channels (44), the channels (44) being formed by inserts (3) surrounded by a tubular sheath (2), the inserts (3) and the sheath (2) being made of formable and optionally hardenable metal in the form of wires (31), wrapped wires (32), piping (34) or shaped sections (33) inserted in the tubular sheath (2) and joined to each other and to the sheath so that they cannot move longitudinally, in particular by compression, welding or soldering, the reduction in the section of the moulding (1) and/or the diameter of the channels (44) being produced by forming.
