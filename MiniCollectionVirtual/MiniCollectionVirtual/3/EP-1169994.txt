<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a capsule including forming a band
seal between a cap and a body of the filled capsule when

the cap has been fitted onto the body, by one or more
applications of gelatin-based sealant in the form of a

band spanning the cap surface and body surface across the
edge of the cap, to form one or more corresponding band

seal layers securing between the cap and body;
characterised in that


the joint distance, being the distance of axial overlap
between the body and cap, is


for No.0 capsules, less than 21.8 mm
for No.1 capsules, less than 19.4 mm
for No.2 capsules, less than 17.8 mm
for No. 3 capsules, less than 15.8 mm
for No. 4 capsules, less than 14.5 mm
for No. 5 capsules, less than 11.5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for forming a band
seal between a cap and a body of a.capsule filled with drugs
for sealing the capsule. More particularly, it relates to a
method for forming a band seal between a cap and a body of a
capsule in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate seal
defects such as bubbles and voids.Capsules filled with various drugs are generally sealed
in the prior art by fitting the cap on the body filled with
drugs, and forming a circumferentially extending band seal
axially spanning from the cap edge to the body surface to
secure the cap to the body.
EP-A-0 271 627 is an example of a document showing
such a method and capsule. The band sealing of capsules
was originally employed for preventing mischief. Since it
became a common practice to fill capsules with liquid drugs,
the purpose of band sealing was diversified into, for
example, purposes of preventing liquid leakage and
preventing permeation of oxygen and water. It is thus
desired to form a positive and accurate band seal on
capsules.In band sealing of capsules, however, bubbles and voids
often occur in the band seal. Then, after band seals are
formed, all the capsules must be inspected to pick up those
capsules having defects in the band seal. Because the
rejected capsules are discarded, a large number of defective
band seals increases waste and is economically
disadvantageous. There is a need for a method for forming a band seal
on a capsule while preventing bubbles and defects from
occurring in the band seal.Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide
a method for forming a band seal on a capsule to lessen
or eliminate the chance of bubbles and perforations
occurring in the band seal.The invention provides a method of producing a
capsule including forming a band seal between a cap and a
body of the filled capsule when the cap has been fitted
onto the body, by one or more applications of gelatin-based
sealant in the form of a
band spanning the cap surface and body surface across the
edge of the cap to form one or more corresponding band
seal layers securing between the cap and body;
   characterised in that the joint distance, being the
distance of axial overlap between the body and cap, is
reduced compared with the standard joint distance,
namely;
for No. 0 capsules, is less than 21.8 mm;for No. 1 capsules, is less than 19.4 mm;for No. 2 capsules, is less than 17.8 mm;for No. 3 capsules, is less than 15.8 mm;for No. 4 capsules, is less than 14.5 mm;for No. 5 capsules, is less than 11.4 mm,

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a capsule (22) including
forming a band seal between a cap (22b) and a body (22a)

of the filled capsule when the cap (22b) has been fitted
onto the body (22a), by one or more applications of

gelatin-based sealant (3,13)
in the form of a band spanning the cap surface and body

surface across the edge of the cap (22b) to form one or
more corresponding band seal layers securing between the

cap and body;
characterised in that

the joint distance, being the distance of axial overlap
between the body and cap, is reduced compared with the

standard joint distance, namely;

for No. 0 capsules, is less than 21.8 mm;
for No. 1 capsules, is less than 19.4 mm;
for No. 2 capsules, is less than 17.8 mm;
for No. 3 capsules, is less than 15.8 mm;
for No. 4 capsules, is less than 14.5 mm;
for No. 5 capsules, is less than 11.4 mm,

said joint distance being less than the above-stated
standard distance by from 0.1 to 0.5 mm.
A method according to claim 1 in which said joint
distance is less than said standard joint distance by

from 0.2 to 0.5 mm.
A method according to claim 1 or 2 in which air at a
temperature up to 10°C is blown onto the band seal after

the sealant is first applied, to cool the band seal to
below 10°C.
