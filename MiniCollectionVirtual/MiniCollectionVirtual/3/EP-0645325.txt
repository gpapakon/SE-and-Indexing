<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the annular obturator, there is arranged, in a pipe (4), a liner (3) which can be displaced back and forth in the axial direction of the pipe (4) and rests on the inner wall of the pipe (4). An actuating device (5, 6, 7) for the liner (3) is provided, and the pipe (4) is provided at one end with a funnel (2) on which there are arranged connection stubs (10) which bear a pyramid-shaped roof (displacement body) (1) which has a guttering (8) running around it.

<CLAIMS>
An annular dam slide valve having a lining tube (3) 
which is slidingly reciprocatable in a tube (4) in 

the direction of the axis of said tube (4) and which 
lies against the inner wall of said tube (4), an 

actuating device (5, 6, 7) being provided for the 
lining tube (3) and the tube (4) being provided at 

its end on the feed side with a hopper (2) on which 
supports (10) are arranged which carry a pyramidal 

roof (1) provided with peripheral eaves (8), it 
being possible to shut off the feed cross-section 

of the stream of bulk material produced between 
the peripheral eaves (8) and the hopper (2) by 

displacing the lining tube into the cavity of the 
roof. 
The annular dam slide valve as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein a flange (11) is arranged on the free edge 

of the hopper (2). 
The annular dam slide valve as claimed in claim 1 or 
2, wherein the actuating device (5, 6, 7) for the 

lining tube (3) consists of a drive (7) having an 
axial magnetic coupling (5, 6). 
The annular dam slide valve as claimed in either of 
claims 1 and 2, wherein the actuating device (5, 6, 

7) for the lining tube (3) consists of a hydraulic 
cylinder.  

 
The annular dam slide valve as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the lining tube (3) has inwardly bevelled 

edges (13).
