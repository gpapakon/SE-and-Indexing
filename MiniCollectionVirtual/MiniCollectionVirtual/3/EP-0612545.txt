<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fixing device for a ski binding with a front jaw and a heel holder, in which the front jaw is assigned a sole support plate, which fixing device can be fastened on the upper side of a ski by means of screws and which has a fixing body associated with the front jaw and a fixing body associated with the heel holder, on which fixing bodies the front jaw and the heel holder can in each case be fixed by means of their base plate either directly or indirectly with a guide rail being interposed. The aim of the invention is to produce an especially simple and yet stable fixing device which, if appropriate, can also be used as a damping arrangement for the ski. According to the invention, it is envisaged that each fixing body (2, 20) can be fastened on the upper side (1a) of the ski (1) by means of fixing lugs (2a, 20a), that each fixing body (2, 20) has at least two, seen in the transverse direction to the longitudinal axis of the ski (1), mutually spaced raised sections (2b, 20b2) which are upwardly delimited in each case by a cover plate (2c, 20c2), that the vertically running delimitations of the raised sections (2b, 20b1, 20b2) are formed by support walls (2i, 20i2), and that the two mutually associated raised sections (2b, 20b2) are interconnected by a web (2d, 20d2) which preferably rests on the upper side (1a) of the ski (1).
