<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) apparatus used in the field for 
analyzing a sample of small volume and/or low 
concentration with the use of a superconducting magnet, 
and more specifically to a sample tube suitable to be 
used in a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus. In the case where a sample is analyzed with 
the use of a superconducting magnet, that is, one 
having an observation frequency for the NMR apparatus 
of from 100 MHz to 600 MHz, the sample tube itself 
should not disturb the uniformity of the magnetic 
field. Therefore, the sample tube has heretofore been 
made of a hard glass material with excellent anti-corrosion 
and heat resistance properties, such as, for 
example, a borosilicate glass or a special hard glass. 
With such superconducting magnets, the sample tube is 
generally positioned with its longitudinal axis 
positioned parallel to the direction of the magnetic 
field. However, as the observation frequency of the 
nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus has increased with 
the progress of superconducting technique, one cannot 
disregard the effect on special resolution due to a  
 
difference in magnetic susceptibility between a sample 
(sample solvent) and a sample tube. That is, if the 
difference in magnetic susceptibility between the 
sample and the sample tube is significant, homogeneity 
of the magnetic field at that portion contacting the 
sample tube is disturbed. It is also known that as the 
measuring magnetic field is increased, these 
differences in magnetic susceptibility will affect the 
resolution of the spectrum. According to a test, it 
becomes clear that if the magnetic susceptibility 
differs by 10% between the glass and the solution, the 
magnetic field at the boundary portion is so disturbed 
that it cannot be corrected by so-called shim coils. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a nuclear magnetic resonance 
apparatus, in which the difference in magnetic 
susceptibility between a sample and a sample tube is 
decreased so that a high resolution can be obtained 
even in the case where a superconducting magnet is 
used. In the broadest aspect of the invention a 
sample tube used in a nuclear magnetic resonance 
apparatus is constructed by using a glass composition 
which has a magnetic susceptibility proximate to that 
of the sample. To accomplish the invention the 
magnetic susceptibility of the glass composition is 
adjusted by incorporating a calculated amount of a 
paramagnetic substance and/or a
