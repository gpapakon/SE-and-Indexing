<ABSTRACT>
A dispersion-strengthened material is described which comprises aluminium or aluminium alloy containing a substantially uniform dispersion of ceramic particles to confer dispersion strengthening which is inherently stable at high working temperatures, the ceramic particles having a diameter of less than 400 nm, and preferably in the range 10 nm to 100 nm. Suitable ceramic dispersoids include Al2O3, TiO2, Al3C4, ZrO2, Si3N4, SiC, SiO2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacture of a dispersion-strengthened
aluminium alloy exhibiting improved stability of strengthening at elevated
temperature.Aluminium alloys are widely used as structural materials in weight critical
applications, such as for aircraft construction. Strength is commonly achieved by
alloying additions such as copper, magnesium, lithium or zinc to produce a
dispersion of fine precipitates following suitable heat treatment. These conventional
aluminium alloys have limited capability for use at elevated temperatures; for long
term creep application they are generally not used at greater than 150°C, for shorter
term applications 200 to 300°C might be a more realistic limit to the working
temperature range. The alloys are limited in use by the limited strengthening
exhibited at elevated temperature resulting from the tendency for precipitates to
coarsen significantly as the temperature is raised. This reduces their effectiveness as
strengthening phases at elevated temperature, and also their effectiveness as
strengthening phases at room temperature after an elevated temperature treatment.Significant developments have been made using rapid solidification techniques to
introduce alloy elements that do not coarsen significantly at temperatures in excess of
200°C. Examples of alloying elements most commonly used are Fe, V, Si, Ce etc.
These approaches produce aluminium alloys with good strength at temperatures of up
to 400°C. However, they are difficult to fabricate because at temperatures exceeding
400°C, the strengthening precipitates coarsen significantly and hence reduce their
strengthening effectiveness. This means that the temperatures for forming
components manufactured from such materials must be limited to less than 400°C.
Such constraints can impose significant limitations on the range of engineering
components which can be effectively manufactured from these materials.Japanese patent publication number 082670075 and US patent 5632827 both describe
an aluminium material having ceramic dispersoids, which in both cases are formed by
in situ development by precipitation during mechanical alloying and die formation
respectively. EP 0751 228 relates to a titanium aluminium intermetallic having
ceramic dispersoids also formed in situ. However, the size and dispersion of ceramic
particles formed in this manner is difficult to control.The present invention is directed towards the provision of an aluminium alloy based
on principles of dispersion strengthening which
