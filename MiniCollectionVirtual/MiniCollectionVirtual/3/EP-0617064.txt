<ABSTRACT>
Propylene copolymers grafted to  alpha , beta -ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid derivatives, comprising,   a random propylene copolymer (I) containing from 0.1 to 15% by weight of copolymerised C2- to C10-alk-1-enes and a random propylene copolymer (II) containing from 15 to 80% by weight of compolymerised C2- to C10-alk-1-enes obtainable by reacting the monomer to be grafted with the propylene copolymer at pressures of from 1 to 300 bar, where, in the absence of an initiator which decomposes to give free radicals, from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight, based on the propylene copolymer, of the monomer to be grafted is mixed with the molten propylene copolymer, and the grafting reaction is carried out at from 200 to 350@C.
