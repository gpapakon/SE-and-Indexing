<ABSTRACT>
An effective method for sterilizing seeds for sprouted 
vegetables and a sprouted vegetables cultivating method in which 

the growth of sprouted vegetables is promoted, with restraining 
the occurrence of their putrefaction caused by the breeding of 

microorganisms, are provided. 
Seeds for sprouted vegetables are subjected to a 
sterilizing treatment comprising exposing seeds to a high 

temperature of 70 °C or more and then quenching the seeds 
quickly. By making shorter the time of exposure even to a high 

temperature, this is 70 °C or more, it is possible to obtain 
seeds in which their putrefaction due to the breeding of 

microorganisms which has hitherto occurred in the growing 
course of sprouted vegetables can be remarkably reduced, 

without giving any bad influence upon the sprouting and growth 
of sprouted vegetables at all. 
Furthermore, the present invention provides a method 
for cultivating sprouted vegetables by use of seeds which have 

been exposed to a high temperature of 70 °C or more and then 
quenched quickly. By use of such seeds subjected to the high-temperature 

sterilizing treatment, it is possible to rear 
sprouted vegetables with a smaller quantity of their 

putrefaction after soaking, and to harvest sprouted vegetables 
capable of being preserved for a long period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present Invention relates to a method for
sterilizing seeds for sprouted vegetables, for example seeds for
various kinds of sprouts such as black mung bean sprouts, mung
bean sprouts, soybean sprouts or alfalfa sprouts, and KAIWARE
radish or the likes, and a method for cultivating sprouted
vegetables.As a problem of the so-called sprouted vegetables,
i.e. various kinds of sprouts, which will be good to eat after
their seeds are sprouted and somewhat grown up, it is important
how to promote their rearing. Although sprouted vegetables will
be cultivated at a temperature and humidity suitable for their
sprouting and growth, such a rearing environment is also an
environment suitable for the breeding of various kinds of
microorganisms.Seeds are generally contaminated on the outer surface
of their shells and sometime on the inner surface thereof by
microorganisms, and this contamination becomes a factor for
putrefying sprouted vegetables in their cultivation. In
particular, in a case of sprouts, seeds must be sprouted and 
grown up in a high temperature and high humidity environment
while supplying water thereto at all times, and under such a
situation, it is therefore very difficult to restrain the
breeding of microorganisms.In a case where sprouted vegetables are cultivated in
the prior art, seeds are washed with water so as to remove
microorganisms therefrom or subjected to a sterilizing treatment
using chlorine or other chemicals, before their soaking which
comprises dipping seeds in warm water for the purpose of
promoting their sprouting. However, it is difficult to
destroy microorganisms effectively, without damaging the life
activity performing abilities of seeds as a living thing, i.e.
their sprouting and growing abilities, and in addition, it
is not permitted to use strong chemicals because sprouted
vegetables are foods which are often eaten fresh.In the prior art, accordingly, microorganisms are
inevitably permitted to breed in some extent when sprouted
vegetables are reared, and as a result, it is unavoidable that
the putrefaction of sprouted vegetables is caused by microorganisms
in the course of their rearing and the preservation
of sprouted vegetables after their harvest is worsened.
Methods of decontaminating and sterilizing vegetable seeds
through prolonged application of heat are disclosed in
SU-A-422368 and in FR-A-1260436. 
state of things.The present invention is intended to provide an
effective method for sterilizing seeds for sprouted vegetables,
for the purpose of supplying seeds
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of sterilizing seeds for sprouts, which comprises exposing
said seeds to a temperature in the range of about 70°C to about 90°C

for a time of about 10 to about 30 seconds, wherein shorter duration
is used with higher temperature; and then quenching said seeds to

ambient temperature.
The method of claim 1, wherein said temperature in the range of about
70°C to about 90°C is effected by dry heat.
The method of claim 2, wherein said dry heat is effected by heated air
or combustion exhaust gases.
The method of claim 1, wherein said temperature of about 70°C to
about 90°C is effected by wet heat.
The method of claim 4, wherein said wet heat is effected by hot water.
The method of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein said seeds are preheated
up to about 45°C prior to exposing said seeds to a temperature in the

range of about 70°C to about 90°C. 
The method of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein said quenching is effected
by bringing said seeds into contact with air at ambient temperature.
The method of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein said quenching is effected
by dipping said seeds into water.
The method of any of claims 1 to 8, which further comprises, after
exposing said seeds to a temperature of about 70°C to about 90°C,

subjecting said seeds to a chlorine treatment.
A method of cultivating sprouted vegetables, which comprises:

subjecting the seeds to a sterilizing treatment according to any
of claims 1 to 9 and cultivating said sterilized seeds.
The method of claim 10, wherein after said sterilizing treatment a
second sterilization step is effected prior to said cultivating.
The method of claims 10 or 11, wherein after the
sterilizing and prior to cultivating, the seeds

are soaked in water having a temperature of
about 30° to 40°C.
