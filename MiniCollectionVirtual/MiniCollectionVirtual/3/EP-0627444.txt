<ABSTRACT>
The monoacetic derivatives of tripeptides leucine-phenylalanine-alanine and 
alanine-leucine-phenylalanine are effective in activating NK lymphocytes to 

identify and destroy directly, that is without any interference by the immune 
system, aberrant tumour cells, metastatic cells, viruses and virus-carrying 

cells, so as to result in an "active immunotherapy". The invention also 
concerns the use of the said monoacetyl-tripeptides in the treatment and 

prophylaxis of cancer and viral diseases, as well as the pharmaceutical 
compositions containing one or both of the said compounds, together wit a 

suitable carrier and, optionally, with other pharmaceutically active 
substances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concems the monoacetic derivatives of the tripeptides
leucine-phenylalanine-alanine and alanine-leucine-phenylalanine, and their
use in the fight against tumours and viruses.In Italian patent applications Nos. 94691A/78 and 51885A/78, filed by the
same applicant, there are disclosed some methods for obtaining mixtures of
substances or pure substances capable of enhancing the defensive ability of
the body through the physiologic stimulation of cells which take part in
mechanisms of immunologic nature occurring in the body itself.In Italian patent No. 1148005, filed by the same applicant and corresponding
to DE-A-3 200 273, a tripeptide is disclosed whose six possible combinations
are capable of enhancing the T-lymphocytes' immune activity; thus, such a
tripeptide behaves as an immunomodulator.The complex mechanism of the immune system, with its effector cells and
their products (i.e., immunoglobulins, lymphokines, monokines, etc.), appears
to be a big biochemical complex, in which the different components, that
stimulate and repress, activate and inactivate, produce and eliminate, are in a
dynamic balance, showing continuous changes depending upon the relative
amounts of humoral and cellular components making up such a complex. As a
consequence, every time the relative amounts of the components of the
system are either physiologically or artificially modified, the system reacts by
activating humoral and cellular powers, that counteract the altered
components for the purpose of attaining a new balance for the whole system.
This explains why everything tried from an immune stand-point by means of
immunoproteins, interferons, interleukines, adoptive immunotherapies, etc.
failed to bring about those results which "in vitro" tests had allowed to 
postulate.In fact, as far as aberrant neoplastic cells are concerned, it is not possible to
grant any chance of survival to even only one of them; therefore, the impact
of a system (such as the immune system), that involves a final balance with
the consequent presence - inside the system itself - of vital aberrant cells
also, is undoubtedly favourable to the latter cells.It is known that among the various groups of specific lymphocytes (i.e.,
helper, suppresser, killer, etc.), there is also a small group (about 10% of all
circulating lymphocytes) found in all mammals, that seems to come from a
primordial immunosurveillance system. The lymphocytes of this group are
able to eliminate, in a non-specific way, that is without the need for
