<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling air conditioning of fixed or moving premises, the premises being air conditioned by virtue of a conditioning unit controlled by a corrector which receives at its inputs a temperature reference value (Tc) and a representative value of the temperature of the premises, characterised in that the device comprises a member for non-linear and non-stationary simulation of the whole constituted by the conditioning unit and by the premises, and in that the corrector comprises means for management (26-28) of the saturation so as to take account of a limitation of the amplitude of the control signal of the process (12) and of the model (13) of the process.
