<CLAIMS>
In a process for preparing a pre-crosslinked
aqueous dispersion by emulsion polymerisation of a hard

monomer a homopolymer of which has a glass transition
temperature greater than 30°C and has a single ethylenically

unsaturated bond in the molecule and a soft monomer a
homopolymer of which has a glass transition temperature of

less than 10°C and has at most one ethylenically unsaturated
bond in the molecule, the proportions of the two monomers

being such that the glass transition temperature of the
dispersion is between 5 and 25°C, in the presence of a

carboxylic acid monomer, other than methacrylic anhybride, in
a quantity representing from 0,5% to 5% by weight of the

solid substances of the dispersion, and of more than 2% by
weight of the solid substances of methacrylic anhydride as

crosslinking monomer.
The process of claim 1, characterised in that
the hard monomer is methylmethacrylate.
The process of claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the soft monomer is butylacrylate.
The process of anyone of claims 1-3,
characterised in that the dispersion has solid substances and

the hard monomer constitutes 30 to 70%, the soft monomer 30
to 70% and the crosslinking monomer 0.5 to 5% by weight of

the solid substances of the dispersion.
The process of claim 4, characterised in that
the crosslinking monomer constitutes from more than 2 to 3%

by weight of the solid substances of the dispersion.
The process of claim 5, characterised in that
the carboxylic acid monomer is acrylic acid. 
The process of anyone of the preceeding claims,
characterised in that comprises adding to the mixture to be

polymerised a hydrophilic monomer in a quantity representing
from 0.2 to 3% by weight of the solid substances of the

dispersion.
The process of claim 7, characterised in that
the hydrophilic monomer is acrylamide.
The process of anyone of the preceeding claims
characterised in that comprises carrying out polymerisation

at between 55 and 85°C and, preferably, between 65 and 70°C.
Aqueous dispersion comprising from 45 to 55% by
weight of water characterised in that it comprises from 55 to

45% by weight of a polymer prepared by a process according to
one of the preceeding claims.
Coating composition, characterised in that it
comprises as a binder an aqueous dispersion as claimed in

claim 10.
