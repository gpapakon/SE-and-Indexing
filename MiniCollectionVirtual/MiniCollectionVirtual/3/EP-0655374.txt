<ABSTRACT>
An anti-lock brake system for vehicles with a driven axle 2 which, for each side of the vehicle, has a wheel, a brake cylinder 31, 32 and a respective rotational-speed sensor 34, 35 assigned to each of these wheels is fitted with a common control valve 23 for the brake pressure in the brake cylinders and with an electronic system 15 for processing the signals emitted by the rotational-speed sensor and for controlling the control valve 32. From the control valve 23, an outlet line 25 leads to a branch point 28 and from there a respective branch line 29, 30 leads to the brake cylinder 31, 32 at the relevant wheel. An ASR (anti-spin regulation) valve 27 is provided at the branch point 28, the said valve connecting the outlet line 25 to the two branch lines 29, 30 in the unactuated position and shutting off the outlet line 25 from the relevant branch line 29 or 30 in the actuated position and building up brake pressure in the relevant brake cylinder by way of an auxiliary system.

An anti-lock brake system for vehicles, having a drive axle
(2), which comprises a wheel, a brake cylinder (31, 32) and a

wheel speed sensor (34, 36) for each side of the vehicle, having
a common control valve (23) for the braking pressure in the

brake cylinders, and having a electronic control unit (15) to
process the signals generated by the wheel speed sensors and to

actuate the control valve (23), an outward conduit (25) connecting
a branching point (28) with a branching conduit (29, 30)

each to the brake cylinders (31, 32) of the respective wheel,

wherein
 an ASR-valve (27) is provided on the branching point
(28), which in the non-actuated position connects the outward

conduit (25) with the two branching conduits (29, 30) and in the
actuated position cuts the outward conduit (25) from the

branching conduit (29 or 30) and builds up braking pressure in
the brake cylinder (31 or 32) concerned via an additional system

(33, 48, 52, 48', 52', 43, 44, 45).
The anti-lock system of Fig. 1, 
wherein
 the ASR-valve (27) is
designed to generate a modulated braking pressure in the brake

cylinder concerned.
The anti-lock system of claim 2
, wherein
 the ASR-valve (27)
is designed as a solenoid valve (43, 44, 45) and comprises at

least three magnets controlled by the electronic control unit
(15) and an intensification piston (48, 48') each assigned to a

branching conduit (29, 30) each. 
The anti-lock system of claim 3, 
wherein
 two pistons (52,
52') are assigned to the intensification pistons (48, 48'), the

pistons being sealingly and slidingly guided in the housing (47)
of the ASR-valve (27), the pistons as part of the branching

conduit comprising a bore (53, 53'), which may be closed by a
projection (50, 50') of the intensification piston (48, 48').
The anti-lock system of claim 3 or 4, 
wherein
 the intensification
piston (48, 48') is divided into an inner and an outer

piston.
The anti-lock system of one of the claims 1 to 5, 
wherein
 the
control valve (23) is designed as a pneumatic valve, a pressure

modulator (26) or a pressure intensifier pneumatic/hydraulic is
provided, and pneumatical support is given to the ASR-valve

(27).
The anti-lock system of one of the claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 the
ASR-valve (27) comprises two solenoid valves (43, 44; 43', 45)

arranged in series and assigned to each intensification piston
(48, 48'), the upstream located solenoid valves (43, 43') being

designed without and the downstream located solenoid valves (44,
45) being provided with separate exhaust opening.
The anti-lock system on one of the claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 a
switching valve (67) is positioned upstream the ASR-valve (27),

which processes reservoir pressure in the one position and
modulated braking pressure in the other position to the ASR-valve

(27).
The anti-lock system of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 the ASR-valve
(27) is designed as a pneumatic relais valve.
The anti-lock system or claim 9, 
wherein
 the ASR-valve (27)
comprises a hollow double valve body (70, 70') for each intensification

piston (48, 48') connecting the branching conduit (29,
30) concerned.
