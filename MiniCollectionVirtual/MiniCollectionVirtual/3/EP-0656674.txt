<ABSTRACT>
An electrical receptacle terminal (2) comprises an 
inner contact (4) and an outer backup spring (6) disposed 

closely therearound. The outer backup spring has a pair of 
opposed spring members (54) disposed over cantilever 

contact arms (14) of the inner contact (4). The spring 
members (54) comprise a first spring arm (56) and lateral 

second spring-support arms (62) disposed substantially 
orthogonally thereto. The first and second spring arms are 

joined at a front end (64) by an L-shaped joining section 
(66), and separated by a slot (68) extending from the 

joining section (66) to a body section (42) of the backup 
spring. The second arms (62) of the spring member (54), 

substantially increase the spring force of the first 
spring arm (54) against which the inner contact arms (14) 

are biased during insertion of a complementary male tab 
therebetween. The spring force of the inner contact arms 

(14) are further increased by providing a U-shaped tab 
(70) folded over free end tips (22) of the contact arms to 

limit sliding movement thereof. The joining section (66) 
at the front end of the backup spring is aligned with the 

box-shaped body section (42) and reduces rocking of the 
terminal when inserted into a corresponding cavity of a 

connector housing. Furthermore, the inner contact body is 
well protected from external objects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical receptacle
terminal having an inner contact with cantilever contact
arms, and an outer backup spring having spring arms for
increasing the spring force of the cantilever contact arms
whereby the spring arms comprise a first arms and a second
arms perpendicular thereto for increasing the spring force
thereof according to the pre-characterizing features of claim 1.There is an increasing demand in the electrical
industry to produce compact and robust terminals having
small material cross-sections, yet carry high electrical
currents whilst remaining reliable. Some of the important
factors determining the current carrying capability of a
terminal is the conductivity of the metal from which the
contact is formed, and the contact resistance between
mating terminals which is largely determined by the
contact pressure exerted therebetween - which in turn is
determined by the spring forces that engage the contact
surfaces together. Unfortunately, the sheet metal commonly
used for producing electrical terminals usually decreases
in resiliency as the conductivity and ductility increases.
For this reason, terminals have been provided with a
backup spring of resilient temperature resistant material
such as steel, that provides added resilient forces stable
over time and at operating temperature. There is however
a need to further increase the spring force of the backup
spring while making the terminal as compact as possible.As most electrical terminals are mounted within
connector housings, the outer backup spring should also
provide an outer support surface that allows the terminals
to be easily inserted and snugly held within corresponding
terminal receiving cavities of the housing.From document EP 0,517,077 A2 an electrical receptacle
terminal stamped and formed from sheet metal has come
to be known, comprising an inner contact body and an
outer back-up spring. The outer back-up spring
has a pair of outer back-up spring arms cooperating
with the contact spring arms.From document US 5,049,095 A an automotive fuse
socket and terminals therefor have come to be known.
The terminal disclosed therein has a L-shaped joining section.It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide a compact and robust electrical receptacle  
terminal for electrical connection to a complementary male
tab terminal, whereby the terminal provides high contact
pressure therebetween and is reliable.A further object of this invention is to provide a
compact terminal with high contact pressure that
