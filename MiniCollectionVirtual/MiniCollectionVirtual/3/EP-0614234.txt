<ABSTRACT>
There is formed a superconducting tunnel 
junction having a three-layer structure formed by 

depositing an upper electrode (34), a 
tunnel barrier layer (33), and a lower 

electrode in sequence in a 
predetermined direction. The cross-sectional area of 

the three-layer structure in a direction perpendicular 
to the direction of the deposition is substantially 

constant along the deposition direction. Further 
preferably, the thickness of lower wiring (32) 

connected to the lower electrode is made smaller 
than the thickness of the lower electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radiation
detecting device using a superconducting tunnel junction.Radiation detector using a superconducting
tunnel junction Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb is known as disclosed, for
example, in the following documents:
a) "Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Superconductor Detector with
Single Crystal Nb Bottom Layer" by M. Kurakado et al,
The Institute of Electronics, Information and
Communication Engineers in Japan, SCE 90-19, July, 25,
1990.b) "Developments in superconducting tunnel
Junction detectors" by M. Kurakado, Nuclear Instruments
and Methods in Physics Research A314 (1992) pp 252-262.c) "X-ray Detector with Nb/AlOx/Nb Superconductor
Detectors" by M. Kurakado et al, Japanese Journal of
Applied Physics, Vol. 28, No. 3, March 1989, pp L459 -
L461.d) "Study of Nb/AlOx/Nb Superconductor Detectors
with X-ray and Pulse Light" by M. Kurakado et al,
Sensors and Actuators, A21 - A23 (1990) pp 33 - 36.In conventional radiation detectors using a
superconducting tunnel junction such as a Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb
junction or a (Nb/Ta)/Al-AlOx/Nb junction, electrons
excited on the energy gap or holes in a superconducting
electrode by radiation are passed through a tunnel
barrier by the tunnel effect, resulting in signal
charge. Herein, holes and electrons are referred to
collectively as excited electrons for brevity. In
fabricating a conventional radiation detector using a
superconducting tunnel junction, lower wiring is formed
by simultaneously patterning the same layer as that of a
lower electrode and hence the lower wiring has the same
thickness as the lower electrode has. As shown in Fig.
1B, therefore, electrons excited by radiation in the
vicinity of lower wiring 2 of a lower electrode 1 are
readily diffused to the lower wiring 2. The probability
of electrons passing through a tunnel barrier 3 and
becoming signal charge is thus lowered. Furthermore,
after the lower electrode 1 has been patterned, an upper
electrode 4 is patterned. In general, therefore, the
area of the lower electrode 1 or the upper electrode 4
is larger than the area of the tunnel barrier 3 disposed
between them as shown in Figs. 1A, 1B and 2.
Furthermore, the size of the lower electrode does not
completely coincide with the size of the upper
electrode, and slight discrepancy is caused. Depending
upon such relative relations among sizes of the upper
electrode, the lower electrode, and the lower wiring, 
electrons excited by radiation incident upon the
vicinity of the junction diffuse to outside of a
junction area included in the lower or upper
