<ABSTRACT>
An elastic fixing roll having an elastic, compliant body material and release 
surface material is disclosed. The body material comprises porous silicone rubber 

of fluorosilicone rubber foam (1) or a porous synthetic polymer foam (11) 
reinforced with silicone rubber or fluorosilicone rubber (17). The release surface 

material (5, 15) is formed of porous polytetrafluoroethylene film containing silicone 
rubber or fluorosilicone rubber. The elastic fixing roll has the strength, resilience, 

and heat resistance and is suitable for use in hot toner fixing assemblies of copying 
machines and printing machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elastic fixing roll, more particularly to an
elastic roll suitable for use as a heating roll or pressure roll in a heated toner fixing
assembly of a photocopy machine or printing machine.In a plain-paper copying (PPC) machine toner images applied to the surface
of paper or other recording medium are fixated by application of heat and pressure.
In certain PPC machines toner fixation is accomplished by passing the image-bearing
recording medium between a hot thermal-fixation roll and a pressure roll to
fuse the toner in place so that it is not easily removed from or is difficult to smear
on the surface of the paper or other recording medium. When this type of thermal-fixation
device is used the toner material is directly contacted by a roll surface and
a portion of the toner adheres to the roll surface. Unless this is controlled, with
subsequent rotation of the roll the adhered toner material may be redeposited on
the recording medium resulting in undesirable offset images, stains, or smears; or,
in severe cases, the recording medium may stick to the adhered toner material on
the roll and become wrapped around the roll.To perform satisfactorily in a thermal fixation assembly the material forming
the pressing surfaces should be sufficiently temperature resistant to operate at the
temperatures required to fuse the toners, capable of complying to an applying
uniform pressure to the toner images, and have, or have imparted to their surface,
release properties that minimise toner pickup. Additionally, these materials should
be sufficiently durable in performing these functions to be cost-effective.In the past, solid rolls consisting of elastic materials such as urethane
rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, silicone rubber, or fluorocarbon rubber have
been used. Such elastic materials, when used alone, suffer the drawback of
having relatively poor release properties and toner particles, paper particles, and
the like, would cling to the rolls and lead to reduced image 
quality and a shorter use-life. When used in conjunction with release agents,
for example, silicone oils applied to their surfaces, or release agents present in
oil-less toners, improved release properties were obtained, however, often at
the expense of durability as many of the elastic materials were degraded by
the release agents and failed prematurely.To overcome these problems solid rolls of elastic materials with a
covering layer of fluoropolymer film or shrink-fit tubing have come into use.
