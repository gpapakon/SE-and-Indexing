<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the production of carbon black in a 
pure form based on natural gas or methane. Decomposition of hydrocarbons for the production of carbon 
black is a well known process and there are a number of methods 
in existence for this purpose. The production of carbon black 
on the basis of methane is also described by the same applicant in Norwegian patent 
application No. 91 4904 (publication N°. 175 718) and in the corresponding International Application with the publication N° WO 93/12030. In the method 
which is described in this application, it has been shown that 
it is possible to decompose hydrocarbons in such a way that the 
physical properties of the carbon black to a great extent can 
be predetermined on the basis of given process parameters. This has proved to be an extremely valuable possibility which 
can open the way for wider areas of application and for the 
achievement of better quality for products in which carbon 
black is already in use as the basic material. From GB 1 492 346, GB 1 400 266 and DD 292 920 are known 
methods and processes for the production of carbon black by the 
pyrolytic decomposition of a hydrocarbon stock in a plasma 
reactor. The produced carbon black may be used in the rubber, 
electrical, paint and printing industries. However, the use is 
only directed to a general application of carbon black, and the 
application of a specific quality in ordrer to obtain special 
properties for products is not disclosed. There has been a need to find new applications for carbon black 
and especially for pure carbon black produced on the basis of 
natural gas, since the natural gas resources which have been 
established are very substantial. Methane is a hydrocarbon gas 
which exists in large quantities, is reasonably priced and has 
been shown to be well suited as a stock material for the 
production of pure carbon black and hydrogen. It seems that  
 
insufficient attention has been paid to the possibility and the 
significance of the use of pure carbon black as the basic 
material fcr final products. Thus the object of the present invention is to provide new 
application of pure carbon black. A further 
object of the invention is to provide opportunities for the 
application of these materials in the form of basic materials 
which are both financially favourable and also afford improved 
quality. These objects are achieved by the application of pure carbon 
black which is produced by the decomposition of natural gas or 
methane into their basic elements
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The application of pure carbon in the form of carbon particles, 
produced on the basis of decomposition of natural gas and/or 

methane into carbon and hydrogen, wherein preheated feed stock 
is passed through a plasma torch and wherein the plasma gas is 

recycled hydrogen, which causes a pyrolytic decomposition of 
the feed stock and wherein the reaction takes place in a 

reaction area, wherein the feed stock, preferably methane, is 
transported through the plasma torch in a temperature-controlled 

lead-in tube so that it has a temperature lower 
than 1000°C, preferably between 650°C and 700°C when it leaves 

the lead-in tube, wherein the feed stock undergoes a first 
uniform heating in an area in the immediate vicinity of the 

plasma flame, the feed stock being fed in centrally in relation 
to the plasma torch's flame, wherein in an area immediately 

behind the plasma flame, there occurs a mixing of the hydrocarbon 
material and the plasma gas, the temperature being 

increased to over 1600°C which is the decomposition temperature 
for the raw material, and wherein free hydrogen and dehydrogenated 

carbon material in the form of drops of liquid are 

formed in this area, wherein the material formed thereby is 
passed on to one or more subsequent stages where the temperature 

is kept between 1200°C and 1600°C and where the final and 
complete decomposition of the hydrocarbons to carbon black and 

hydrogen is performed, wherein further raw materials are added 
in this area which cause quenching and react with the already 

produced carbon black, thereby causing an increase in the 
particle size, density and amount produced without further 

energy supply, whereafter the products created are discharged 
and separated and that hot gas may be transported in a return 

pipe to the torch in order to further increase the energy 
yield, and wherein the temperatures in the reaction area are 

controlled by adjusting the feed rates for reactant and plasma 
gas and/or by regulating the energy supply to the plasma torch 

and/or by adjusting the pressure in the reaction area, thus  
 

enabling the quality of the carbon black created to be 
controlled to achieve the desired quality, wherein the carbon is 

in the form of a specially defined material with regard to 
particle size, structure, surface, specific weight, degree of 

acidity, electrical conductivity, reactivity, etc. in order to 
obtain special properties for the creation of special products 

within the metallurgical industry such as reduction material, 
anode material, carburization material or lining material, as 

the carbon has a surface area (BET) of 5-30 m²/g, a dibutyl 
phthalate absorption (DBP) of 30-200 ml/100 g, a specific 

electrical resistance of less than 0.1 ohmcm and a reactivity 
less than 1000 ml SiO for use as a reduction material, a BET 

value of less than 5 m²/g, a DBP value of less than 30 ml/100 
g, a specific weight compressed to 1.5-1.7 g/cm³ and a specific 

electrical resistance of less than 0.1 ohmcm for use as an 
anode material for Al production, a BET of between 5 and 

30 m²/g and DBP of between 30 and 200 ml/100g, a specific 
electrical resistance of less than 0,1 ohmcm and a hydrogen 

content less than 200 ppm for use as a carburizing material 
for the steel industry.
