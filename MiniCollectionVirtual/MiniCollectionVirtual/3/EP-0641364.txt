<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polysuccinimide and a salt of polyaspartic acid.The salts of polyaspartic acid have been used for fertilizers, and scale inhibition agents. They
are particularly useful for the prevention of scale deposition in boiler water, reverse osmosis membranes
and in detergents. One of the primary characteristics that makes them valuable in this respect is the
fact that they are readily biodegradable, whereas other materials that are presently used for this purpose
are either slowly biodegradable, e.g. polyacrylic acid, or harmful to the environment, e.g. polyphosphoric
acid.Sodium polyaspartate was used in the prevention of boiler scale by changing the crystal
structure of calcium salts resulting in the formation of a soft scale (Sarig et al, The use of polymers for
retardation of scale formation. Natl Counc Res Dev [Rep] (lsr.), 150, 1977). Polyaspartic acid, molecular
weight (MW) 6,000, was found to be superior to polyglutamate, MW 14,400, polyvinyl sulfonate, MW
5300, and polyacrylic acid, MW 6,000, in that it gave 66% retardation of total scale and 90% retardation
of calcium sulfate scale. In addition, the scale formed in the presence of polyaspartate was softer than
that produced in the presence of polyacrylate, polyglutamate and polyvinyl sulfonate.U.S. Pat. 4,839,461 discloses a method for making polyaspartic acid from maleic acid and
ammonia by reacting these constituents in a 1:1-1.5 molar ratio by raising the temperature to 120°-150° C.
over a period of 4-6 hours and maintaining it for 0-2 hours. It is further disclosed that temperatures
above 140°-160° C. result in elimination of CO2, thus teaching degradation of the material. The molecular
weight range obtained by this method was said to be 1,000-4,000 with a cluster at 1,800-2,000. That
patent states that this material is useful in the prevention of tarnishing glass and porcelain articles.
Although not stated in this patent, it is known that this action would occur as a result of the inhibition
of calcium sulfate deposition. Harada, et al (Thermal polycondensation of free amino acids with
polyphosphoric acid. Origins Prebiol. systems Their Mol Matrices, Proc. Conf., Wakulla Springs, FL, 289,
1963) obtained polyaspartic acid from aspartic acid and phosphoric acid at temperatures over 100°C.
over a time period of 50-250 hrs, but required temperatures over 170° without phosphoric acid being
present.U.S. Pat 5,057,597 discloses a method for the polycondensation of aspartic acid to produce
polyasp
