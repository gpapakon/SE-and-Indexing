<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide color
photographic light-sensitive material, more specifically to a
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material which
excels in a color reproduction and an image fastness and which
has an excellent color developability.In general, in a color image forming-process using a
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material, a
color image is formed from three color dyes derived from
yellow, magenta and cyan couplers.An aptitude of a color developability in each color is
judged by an absorption characteristic, and the absorption
characteristic of a color-developed dye can be shown by a
spectral absorbing wave form, that is, a characteristic value
such as a maximum absorbing wavelength and an absorption
coefficient. In addition to these values, a presence of a subabsorption,
a width of an absorption band and a sharpness of an
absorption end are important in a problem on a color
reproduction of a color photo. For example, a white light is
composed of a blue light (400 to 500 nm), a green light (500 to
600 nm) and a red light (600 to 800 nm). Absorption of the
green light by a magenta dye provides a red purple color which
is the complementary color thereof. In this case, an inferior 
absorption characteristic of the magenta dye allows a part of
the blue light and the red light to be absorbed and causes a
hue to be turbid. A vivid color can not be reproduced with the
dye having such the inferior absorption characteristic.A magenta coupler determines a quality of a color
development of a green color which is the most sensitive to a
human being's eye and therefore, the absorption characteristic
thereof is important. In recent years, a pyrazoloazole series
coupler having an excellent absorption characteristic has been
developed as the magenta coupler in order to improve a color
reproduction. Of them, a 1H-pyrazolo[3, 2-c][1, 2, 4]triazole
series magenta coupler and a 1H-pyrazolo[1, 5-b][1, 2,
4]triazole series magenta coupler are excellent in terms of not
only an absorption characteristic of a dye but also a color
developability as compared with the other couplers. The
pyrazolotriazole type coupler does not show a sub-absorption in
a blue light region as compared with a pyrazolone type coupler
and the absorption end thereof at a longer wavelength side is
sharply cut, and an excessive absorption in a red light region
is very small as well.An optimum absorption wavelength of a magenta dye is
varied according to a cyan coupler and a yellow coupler
