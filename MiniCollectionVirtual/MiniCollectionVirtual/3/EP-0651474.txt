<ABSTRACT>
A complete electrical harness, for example for an 
automotive vehicle, is made up of separate harness modules 

(8,20,30,44). Each of these modules comprises a main 
electrical connector module, (10,22,32,46), and a 

plurality of satellite connectors (14,24,34,48) each 
having at least one contact position. Predetermined 

contact positions of each main connector module (10, 22, 
32, 46) are connected by leads, which may be of different 

gauges, to predetermined contact positions of the 
satellite connectors. Connectors of each harness module 

(10, 22, 32, 46) have terminals with insulation 
displacement portions (110) for connection to the leads, 

and mating portions (108). The mating portions (108) of 
the main connector modules (10,22,30,46) are for 

connection to power or signal current sources, the mating 
portions (108) of the satellite connectors (14,24,34,46) 

are for mating with mating terminals of predetermined 
appliances, for example appliances of automotive vehicle. 

The main connector modules may be received in a common 
housing to provide a single main connector one (44) of the 

main connector modules may be connected to another (32) of 
the main connector modules by way of a lead having plugs 

or sockets (54,55). The harness modules (8,20,30,44) can 
be made by means of automated machinery, according to a 

modular harness making program derived from a rationalized 
diagram of a conventional electrical harness comprising a 

single main connector having rows of electrical terminals 
connected to respective electrical terminals of a 

multiplicity of satellite electrical terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method of making an 
electrical harness, in particular a harness for an 
automotive vehicle, to an electrical harness and to a 
machine for making harness modules for that harness. A typical known electrical harness, for example, an 
engine harness for an automotive vehicle, comprises a main 
electrical connector having at least three rows of 
electrical terminals, for example four rows, each terminal 
having a mating portion and a lead connecting portion, a 
multiplicity of satellite electrical connectors each 
having at least one electrical terminal having a mating 
portion and a lead connecting portion, and leads of 
predetermined lengths each connected to the lead 
connecting portion of a respective terminal of a satellite 
connector and of a respective terminal of the main 
connector. In use of the harness, the mating portions of the 
terminals of the satellite connectors are mated with 
corresponding terminals of appliances of the vehicle and 
the main connector is mated with a further connector which 
is in turn connected to power and signal current sources 
for the appliances. In such a known harness, the lead 
connecting portions of the terminals of the main and 
satellite connectors are crimped to the leads and are then 
loaded into the respective connector housings, the leads 
having been previously cut to different lengths to allow 
for the locations of the appliances in the vehicle. The 
usual procedure for making such a harness, is to lay out 
the satellite connectors and the leads on a harness making 
board, crimp the terminals to their respective leads and 
load them into the respective connector housings. Ground 
connections, for example to the body of the vehicle, are 
made by soldering pairs of leads each to a ring tongue  
 
terminal for connection to ground. The procedure described 
above is accordingly unduly time consuming. According to another aspect of the present invention 
a method of making a modular electrical harness comprises 
the steps of; producing a rationalized circuit diagram of 
a conventional electrical harness comprising a single main 
electrical connector having rows of electrical terminals 
connected to respective electrical terminals of a 
multiplicity of satellite electrical connectors; deriving 
from said diagram a modular harness making program; 
providing according to the program a plurality of main 
electrical connector modules, each having a mating portion 
and a lead receiving portion having a lead receiving slot 
and a
