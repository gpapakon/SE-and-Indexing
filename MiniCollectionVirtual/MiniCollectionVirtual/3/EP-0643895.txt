<ABSTRACT>
An emergency response system that includes a solid state location identification module, preferable in solid state circuit form, associated with each residence (15) or each extension of a PBX (17) is disclosed. Preferably, the location identification modules are powered by telephone line voltage. A location identification module is enabled when its associated telephone goes off-hook and an emergency code, e.g., 911 is dialed. Thereafter, in response to an inquiry from the emergency response center (23) that receives the emergency call, the location identification module sends the location of the associated telephone to the emergency response center operator where the location is displayed on a dispatcher's console (57).

<DESCRIPTION>
 EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMTechnical Area This invention relates to telephone networks and, more particularly, to an emergency response system that forms a portion of a telephone network. Background of the InventionIn recent years, emergency response systems have come into widespread use in the United States. If not already in existence, emergency response systems are likely to become widely used in other countries of the world. As a matter of fact, several Western European countries already have emergency response systems.In an emergency response system, emergency calls are made by dialing a specific emergency code~911 in the United States and 999 in Western Europe. The calls are routed to an emergency response center, denoted a public safety answering point ("PSAP") in the U.S. In the U.S., basic 911 service merely provides routing of 911 service calls to the PSAP serving the subscribing community. Enhanced 911 service drastically improves basic 911 service. Enhanced 911 service provides automatic number identification ("ANI") and automatic location identification ("ALI"), in addition to selectively routing emergency response, i.e., 911, calls to PSAPs. With ANI, a 911 dispatcher receives a visual display of the telephone number associated with the telephone that originated the 911 call. With ALI, the dispatcher also receives a visual display of the name and address associated with the calling telephone number. Obviously, the extra information aids in promptly responding to the emergency.Unfortunately, present enhanced 911 emergency response systems have two major disadvantages. One disadvantage is the cost of operating such a system. 

The cost is prohibitive for many small communities within the United States. The second disadvantage is the difficulty in identifying the exact location of the telephone that placed a 911 call in all circumstances.Enhanced 911 emergency response system costs can be broken down into two categories. The first category is the cost of the equipment necessary to establish the system. Overall, this cost is relatively minimal. The major cost of an enhanced 911 emergency response system is the ongoing cost associated with obtaining and maintaining a database that includes current address information. At the present time, regional organizations provide location identification information to local communities that operate 911 enhanced emergency response systems. Obviously, a massive effort is required to maintain address information current. Address information is maintained in
