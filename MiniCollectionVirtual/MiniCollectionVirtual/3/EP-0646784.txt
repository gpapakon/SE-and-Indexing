<ABSTRACT>
A video test strip reader (10) uses a video imager or camera (12) for 
viewing 

a viewing field (14) containing reagent test strips (16) each having test 
pads (28) reacted with a 

specimen containing constituents of interest. The video imager 
produces an analog 

signal representing an image of the viewing field. An image 
handler (18) coupled to 

the video imager converts or digitizes the analog signal into 
a digital signal 

representing the image and stores the image in the form of an 
array of pixels 

representing the image. Each pixel contains color information 
broken down into 

red, green or blue (RGB). A processor (24) coupled to the image handler 
analyzes the 

array of pixels, determines the location and orientation of a test 
strip, identifies the 

test areas on the test strip, measures the corresponding test 
areas on the strip at the 

proper times and calculates the test results, such as the concentration 
of the 

constituents of interest in the specimen or other measurable 
properties of the 

specimen such as color or specific gravity, etc. Accordingly, 
the video test strip 

reader can simultaneously locate, color analyze and time track 
multiple test strips on the viewing field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field of clinical chemistry.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a visual imaging system that
analyzes the color change associated with one or more test areas on a test strip
following contact thereof with a liquid specimen, such as urine or blood.Reagent test strips are widely used in the field of clinical chemistry. A test
strip usually has one or more test areas, and each test area is capable of
undergoing a color change in response to contact with a liquid specimen. The
liquid specimen usually contains one or more constituents or properties of interest.
The presence and concentrations of these constituents of interest in the specimen
are determinable by an analysis of the color changes undergone by the test strip.
Usually, this analysis involves a color comparison between the test area or test pad
and a color standard or scale. In this way, reagent test strips assist physicians in
diagnosing the existence of diseases and other health problems.Color comparisons made with the naked eye can lead to imprecise
measurement. Today, strip reading instruments exist that employ reflectance
photometry for reading test strip color changes. These instruments accurately
determine the color change of a test strip within a limited wavelength range or
bandwidth but sometimes fail to measure minute color inconsistencies outside the
limited bandwidth. For example, such an instrument can fail to detect traces of
blood within a urine specimen on a MULTISTIX® reagent strip of the type sold by
Miles Inc., Diagnostics Division, of Elkhart, Indiana 46515. After the urine
specimen contacts the test pad of a MULTISTIX® reagent strip, intact blood cells
appear as tiny green blotches on the yellow test area. Existing strip readers detect
the overall color of the test pad but can ignore the small blotches of green. In
addition, existing strip reading instruments using one or more wavelengths can 
lead to a false positive bilirubin result in the presence of interference from
indoxyl sulfate. Visually, the atypical color is easily detected but not by prior
strip readers that only analyze a limited bandwidth of the entire visual spectrum.The first commercially available strip reading instruments of this type were
effective but unable to adequately cope with the large numbers of specimens
handled by clinical laboratories. These instruments require inserting a single test
strip, reading the test strip and removing the test strip from the instrument before
the instrument
