<ABSTRACT>
A swivel hook comprises a hook body (10) including a 
proximal part (10a) having an aperture (28) formed at its 

upper end to define a pair of overhangs (28a, 28a) and a 
substantially J-shaped hook portion (14) extending downward 

from the proximal part (10a), an annular link (12) having an 
connecting axle (20) provided on one side thereof, the 

connecting axle (20) having an enlarged head (22) formed on 
its distal end, the enlarged head (22) being inserted into the 

aperture (28) into engagement with the overhangs (28a, 28a); a 
locking member (16) having a pair of opposing side walls (23, 

23) defining therebetween a chamber (24); and biasing means 
(18) mounted in the chamber (24). The proximal part (10a) of 

the hook body (10) is pivotally mounted on the locking 
member (16) within the chamber (28) with the aperture (28) 

closed by the opposing side walls (23, 23) and with the biasing 
means (18) acting between the proximal part (10a) and the 

locking member (16) for normally urging the locking member 
(16) into engagement with the J-shaped hook portion (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a swivel hook to be used 
on rucksacks, pack sacks, baggages, etc. and particularly relates 
to a swivel hook which is comprised of a hook body, a 
connecting ring pivotally mounted on the hook body, a locking 
member pivotally mounted on the hook body so as to firmly 
engage the tip of the hook body under the bias of a spring. Generally speaking, up to now, in order to assemble a 
swivel hook of the type described above, either of the two 
pieces, that is, the hook body or the connecting ring has a 
connecting axle and the other has a through hole, vice versa. 
After the connecting axle of one piece is fitted into the through 
hole of the other piece, the appropriate part of the other piece 
which surrounds the through hole is squeezed so as to firmly 
hold the two pieces together. Instead of a squeezing operation, another type of 
conventional swivel hooks can be assembled by a snap-fitting 
operation, the typical example of which is disclosed in Japanese 
Utility Model Publication No. 57-45455. This conventional 
swivel hook is comprised of a substantially rectangular ring 
and a substantially J-shaped hook integrally formed with and 
disposed on a lower side of the rectangular ring. The 
rectangular ring is intended for receiving a belt therethrough. 
The proximal part of the J-shaped hook has a chamber formed 
for receiving a proximal part of a locking member therein. A 
shaft is mounted in the chamber of the J-shaped hook. The 
locking member has a dog-legged groove formed in the  
 
proximal part thereof. The dog-legged groove is open at one 
end and terminates in a bearing hole at the other end. The 
proximal part of the locking member also has a cavity formed 
therein. One end of a plate spring is inserted into the cavity of 
the locking member and the other end projects beyond the 
cavity. In order to assemble this snap-fitting type swivel hook, 
to start with, one end of the plate spring is inserted into the 
cavity of the proximal part of the locking member. Then, the 
locking member is mounted on the hook body by fitting the 
shaft of the latter into the bearing hole through the dog-legged 
groove of the former. In this way, the other end projecting 
beyond the cavity comes into abutting engagement with the 
proximal end of the hook body, thus biasing the locking 
member into abutting engagement with the tip of the J-shaped 
body. This complete the assembling of the swivel hook. However, these conventional swivel hooks suffer from 
drawbacks. The assembling

A swivel hook comprising a hook body (10) including a 
proximal part (10a) and a substantially J-shaped hook portion 

(14) extending downward from the proximal part (10a), a 
connecting ring (12), a locking member (16) and biasing means 

(18) for normally urging the locking member (16) into 
engagement with the J-shaped hook portion (14); characterized 

in that the proximal part (10a) has a re-entrant aperture (28) formed in 
its upper end to define a pair of overhangs (28a, 28a) at said end, the 

connecting ring (12) having an connecting axle (20) provided 
on one side thereof, the connecting axle (20) having an 

enlarged head (22) formed on its distal end, the enlarged head
