<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed to make any protein in a form that can be isolated rapidly from a solution using a specific monoclonal antibody designated "HPC-4". It has now been determined that it is possible to form a fusion protein of the epitope with a protein to be isolated, and isolate the protein using HPC-4-based affinity chromatography. In the preferred embodiment, a specific protease cleavage site is inserted between the epitope and the protein so that the epitope can be easily removed from the isolated protein. In an example, a functionally active soluble tissue factor including the twelve amino acid epitope recognized in combination with calcium by HPC-4 and a factor Xa cleavage site was expressed from a vector inserted into a procaryotic expression system. The recombinant tissue factor can be rapidly isolated in a single chromatographic step using the HPC-4 monoclonal antibody immobilized on a suitable substrate. Once isolated, the Protein C epitope is removed by cleavage with factor Xa, leaving the functionally active, soluble tissue factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The United States government has rights in this
invention by virtue of grants from the National
Institutes of Health, grant numbers R01 HL44225 and
R01 HL29807.This invention is generally in the area of
methods for purifying proteins, especially blood
clotting proteins, using recombinant technology and an
unique epitope of a monoclonal antibody directed
against Protein C zymogen.Methods for purifying proteins have been used
for many years and can be generally divided into
chromatographic methods, for example, ion exchange
chromatography, molecular weight sieving, high
pressure liquid chromatography, affinity
chromatography, and electrophoretic methods, for
example, electrophoresis on agarose or acrylamide gels
and isoelectric focusing. The usual disadvantages of
all of these methods are that they require the
starting material be passed through several processes
to remove contaminants to the point where the desired
material is substantially pure.In immunoaffinity chromatography, an antibody to
the desired protein or other molecule is immobilized
on a chromatographic substrate, the protein mixture is
applied to the substrate under conditions allowing the
antibody to bind the protein, the unbound material is
removed by washing, and the bound protein is eluted
using, for example, high or low pH, protein
denaturants or chaotropes. The end result is a
substantially pure protein which often lacks full
biological activity.A variation of this method is described in U.S.
Serial No. 07/730,040 filed July 12, 1991, which is a
continuation of U.S. Serial No. 07/292,447 entitled
"Monoclonal Antibody against Protein c" filed December
30, 1988 by Charles T. Esmon and Naomi L. Esmon, 
disclosing the properties of the monoclonal antibody,
HPC-4. The hybridoma cell line which secretes the
monoclonal antibody designated as HPC-4, was deposited
with the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,
MD, on November 2, 1988, and assigned ATCC No. HB
9892. This deposit is available to the public upon
the grant of a patent.HPC-4 binds protein C, not activated protein C
(APC), and only in the presence of calcium. Thus,
when the antibody is immobilized on an affinity
support, protein C can be isolated from either plasma-derived
sources or from tissue culture expression
systems under extremely mild conditions. This is
important in maintaining the biological activity of
the product and the stability of the solid support
resin. Because activated protein C is not bound under
any conditions, the resulting product is completely
free of
