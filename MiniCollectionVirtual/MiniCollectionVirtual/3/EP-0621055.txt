<ABSTRACT>
A rate adaptive pacemaker and method of operation, where the sensor-indicated 
rate is adjusted as a function of sensed sinus rate. The pacemaker of this 

invention is particularly adapted for VDDR operation. The natural sinus rate is 
compared to the sensor-indicated rate at one or more rates and the sensor 

response function is adjusted or adapted as a function of such 
comparisons, so as to optimize sensing of the atrial rate and maintenance of 

synchronous operation. The rate response function may be adjusted specifically at 
upper pacing limit, and may also be adjusted as a function of comparisons made at 

other rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rate responsive demand
pacemaker according to the pre-characterizing portion of claim
1.Such a generic pacemaker is known from EP 0 324 598 A2.Dual chamber rate responsive pacemakers are now widely available from
pacemaker manufacturers. Such pacemakers may be of many types, including the types
designated as DDDR or VDDR. The DDDR pacemaker paces and senses in both
chambers, i.e., both the atrium and the ventricle, and has rate responsive (R) backup to
provide pacing in the absence of sensed natural beats, or to provide rate responsive
ventricular pacing during atrial tachyarrhythmias in the absence of natural ventricular
beats. The DDDR pacemaker has a lead that is placed within the atrium to deliver
atrial pace pulses, as well as to sense natural atrial (sinus) signals, and a ventricular
lead for pacing and sensing in the ventricle. In contrast, the VDDR pacemaker paces
only in the ventricle, although it senses in both the atrium and the ventricle. The
VDDR pacemaker system may be made simpler by incorporating a single lead, which
has a floating atrial electrode for sensing atrial signals, in a known manner. The
VDDR pacemaker is indicated for patients who are determined to have a good and
reliable sinus rate, so that for a good bit of the anticipated lifetime of the patient, 
natural atrial signals will be present from which ventricular pace pulses can be tracked,
thereby providing synchronized pacing.Particularly with respect to the VDDR pacemaker, it is seen that there is
an inherent desirability of maximizing use of the sinus rate, i.e., avoiding takeover of
the pacing function as long as a good atrial signal is present and sensed. For a rate
responsive pacemaker, this leads to the desirability of correlating the rate response as
closely as possible to the sensed natural sinus, while still enabling the rate response to
take over pacing control when and if the sinus does not accurately reflect cardiac
demand. Thus, for example, if a patient develops chronotropic incompetence after
implant of a VDDR pacemaker, there must be an ability to switch modes or otherwise
enable the sensor response to override the sinus.The prior art indicates many schemes for adjusting rate response as a
function of exercise. Such schemes include algorithms for ramping up rate upon the
onset of exercise, and ramping down rate after exercise, so as to provide a more
physiologically natural response to exercise. Such pacemaker systems thus involve
predetermined programming for optimizing the pacing
