<ABSTRACT>
A process for making high porosity boehmite alumina comprising forming an aqueous dispersion of a boehmite alumina which has been obtained by hydrothermally treating an aqueous mixture of a precursor boehmite alumina at a pH of from about 5 to about 9 for a period of time sufficient to convert the greater portion of the precursor boehmite alumina to a colloidal sol, treating the dispersion of the hydrothermally treated alumina to form a viscous gel and subjecting the gel to sufficient shearing force for a sufficient period of time to increase the pore volume by at least 30 % and the median pore radius by at least 20 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PREPARATION OF ALUMINA HAVING INCREASED POROSITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for preparing alumina having increased porosity. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process in which the porosity of alumina can be controlled.2. Description of the BackgroundAlumina finds wide use in the manufacture of ceramic filters, catalyst supports, etc., where chemical and/or heat resistance is necessary. For example, autocatalyst supports used in catalytic converters are subject to high temperatures which can affect the structural stability of the catalyst support. Additionally, in order for an autocatalyst support to function effectively it is desirable that the catalyst support have a sufficiently great porosity so as to render the support more user friendly to catalyst(s) deposited on the support to provide a larger active catalytic surface for deposition of the catalyst. Further, increased porosity makes the catalyst deposited on the support more accessible to reactants as well, increasing the effectiveness of the catalyst. Aluminas of enhanced porosity can also be used, for example, to produce ceramic filters of greater efficiency and, in colloidally dispersed form, efficient thixotropes. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an alumina having increased porosity.Another object of the present invention is to provide an alumina which can be used to make high porosity catalyst supports and porous ceramic bodies.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a a process in which the porosity of boehmite alumina can be controlled to a desired extent.The above and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description given herein and the appended claims. The present invention is based upon the finding that by subjecting gels of certain aluminas to working, e.g. shearing, porosity, in terms of an increase in both the median pore radius and the total pore volume, can be increased. Specifically, the working of the alumina gel is continued until the median pore radius increases by at least about 20 percent and the total pore volume increases by at least about 30 percent. The porosity of certain hydrothermally treated boehmite aluminas which are generally considered water-dispersible can be greatly increased according to the process of the present invention. It is believed that these aluminas exist as aggregates or agglomerates which in turn are
