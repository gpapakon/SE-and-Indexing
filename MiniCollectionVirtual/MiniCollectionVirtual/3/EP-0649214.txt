<ABSTRACT>
A switching boost regulator (L1,Q1,D1), including auxiliary circuitry 
(L2,Q2,D2) having an auxiliary switch (Q2) and inductor (L2) connected to operate 

the regulator in a zero-voltage transition mode, achieves substantial efficiency 
improvement by limiting losses in the auxiliary circuitry dedicated to achieving 

zero-voltage transition operation. Loss reduction circuitry (D3,T2,D4,R2) included 
with the auxiliary circuitry cooperatively operates to limit turn-on and conduction 

losses and to suppress ringing of the components of the auxiliary circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to switching mode regulators and in particular 
highly efficient switching mode regulators in which the losses of switching 
components are minimized. Switching mode regulators have wide application as low loss power 
supplies. One particular application is at the front end of power rectifiers where they 
are controlled, by pulse width modulation techniques, to provide enhanced power 
factor at the input AC power line feed. Regulators are chosen which are highly 
efficient so that the overall power processing system is highly efficient. Accordingly 
switching regulators are designed using controlled wave forms and careful timing to 
minimize losses at the switching transitions of the various non-linear switching 
components. These regulators are embodied in circuit topologies that emphasize 
near zero or zero-voltage switching. In zero voltage switching the conductivity 
transition to the conducting state of the active power switch occurs when the voltage 
of the power switch is at a substantially zero level. In some arrangements other 
switching components of the circuit may be controlled to switch at a zero or near 
zero voltage. A particular example of such a circuit is a boost regulator designed to 
achieve zero or near zero voltage switching. Such a circuit may indeed achieve the 
low loss or lossless switching criteria for at least the active power switch but the 
very circuitry added for achieving near zero or zero-voltage switching induces other 
transient phenomena that reduces the efficiency gains of zero voltage switching and 
further induces undesirable stress on other circuit components of the power 
regulator. A switching boost regulator, including auxiliary circuitry having an 
auxiliary switch and inductor connected to operate the regulator in a near zero or 
zero-voltage switching mode (herein after designated ZVS), achieves substantial 
efficiency improvement by limiting losses in the auxiliary circuitry dedicated to 
achieving ZVS operation. Loss reduction circuitry included with the auxiliary 
circuitry cooperatively operates to limit turn-on and conduction losses and to 
suppress ringing of the components of the auxiliary circuit.  The loss reduction circuitry includes circuitry for limiting conductive 
and switching losses in passive switching devices of the auxiliary circuit used for 
clamping and rectification. Circuitry for limiting ringing and peak inverse voltages 
of the auxiliary switch include circuitry for absorption of transient energy of a 
clamping
