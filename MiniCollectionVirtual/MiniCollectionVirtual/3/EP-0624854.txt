<ABSTRACT>
This mat (1) for computer "mouse" is intended to be placed on any work surface. It includes a rigid and stippled plane upper part (2) made from an antistatic material so as to provide for the movement of the "mouse" and of an antislip lower part (3) in contact with the work surface. It is noteworthy that the mat (1) consists of a single-component material in the form of a slender plate furnished on its underside with at least one adhesive face (3) enabling it to be retained and applied directly in a desired position. Preferably, the single-component material is transparent so as to reveal, whilst protecting it, a graphic constituted by the adhesive face(s) of colours and of specified shapes.
