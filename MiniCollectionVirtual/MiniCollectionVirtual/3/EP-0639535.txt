<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a biological aerated filter 
comprising an upstanding hollow column (10), the column 

being packed with support media (14) for microbial biomass, 
and a portion of the interior of the column at the lower end 

(12) being free of support media and housing an air diffuser 
(15), whereby in use liquid effluent is contained in the 

column and surrounds microbial biomass on the support 
matrix, and air is diffused through the effluent by the air 

diffuser.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treatment of effluent such as 
sewage, and more particularly to apparatus and a process for 
improving the quality of effluent from a sewage treatment 
works. In a conventional sewage treatment plant, crude sewage 
is first screened to remove grit and other hard solids. It 
is then passed to a primary sedimentation tank where 
suspended solids are allowed to gradually settle and are 
removed in the form of a liquid raw sludge. The raw sludge 
is passed to a sludge digestion plant and the digested 
sludge is subsequently dried. Effluent from the primary 
tank is subjected to secondary treatment. A commonly used 
form of secondary treatment is a so called "biological 
filter". This is not a filter as such, but is a tank 
containing solid media providing a large surface area on 
which colonies of microorganisms (generally aerobic 
microorganisms) form a biomass and are exposed to the liquid 
effluent and to the surrounding air. These microorganisms 
break down noxious substances in the effluent. Filter 
effluent from the biological filter is passed to a humus 
tank where settlement again is allowed to take place. 
Settled sludge from the humus tank is returned to the 
primary sedimentation tank. Effluent from the humus tank is 
discharged to a water course. Such basic processes are 
described in "An Introduction to Sewage Treatment", 
published by the Institute of Water Pollution Control, 1987. A common problem for existing sewage treatment works is 
that they have become overloaded with the increase in 
population being served by the works. They have very little 
land available for expansion, and in any case the  
 
engineering works needed for providing additional tanks is 
very expensive. Another problem faced by sewage treatment plants is the 
variability of the incoming crude sewage. The volume and 
concentration of incoming crude sewage can vary depending on 
weather conditions and seasonal variations. For example, in 
holiday resorts, it is desirable to be able to provide 
increased capacity for sewage works to cope with seasonal 
increases in the load, without the need for expensive civil 
engineering work to increase the hydraulic and biological 
capacity of the works. It is also desirable that the 
additional capacity required to cope with seasonal load 
variations can be brought up to operational efficiency 
quickly. Biological aerated filters have been developed to 
provide improved biological filters. A biological aerated 
filter is a biological filter including means

<CLAIMS>
1 A biological aerated filter comprising an 
upstanding hollow column (10), the column being packed with 

support media (14) for microbial biomass, and a portion of 
the interior of the column at the lower end (12) being free 

of support media and housing an air diffuser (15), whereby 
in use liquid effluent is contained in the column and 

surrounds microbial biomass on the support matrix, and air 
is diffused through the effluent by the air diffuser. 
2 A biological aerated filter according to Claim 1, 
in which the column has an effluent inlet or outlet (17) at 

its lower end and an effluent outlet or inlet (18) at its 
upper end. 
3 A biological aerated filter according to Claim 1 
or 2, in which the column is cylindrical and the air 

diffuser is circular, the diameter of the active area of the 
diffuser being at least half of the diameter of the column. 
4 A biological aerated filter according to any of 
Claims 1 to 3, in which the active area of the air diffuser 

is generally constituted by a multi-perforated flexible 
membrane. 
5 A biological aerated filter according to Claim 1, 
in the form of a packing (31) in an upright tube (30), the 

air diffuser (33) being positioned at the bottom of the 
tube, and the tube being open at the top and the bottom to 

permit flow of effluent through the solid matrix, the flow 
being entrained by the stream of air bubbles from the air 

diffuser. 
6 A liquid-waste treatment installation, comprising 
a plurality of biological aerated filters according to 

Claim 5 fitted inside a tank (40,41) and an air supply pipe 
(42) passing around the internal periphery of the tank with 

the air diffusers (33) and respective biological aeration 

filter tubes (30) being mounted on the air supply pipe.
