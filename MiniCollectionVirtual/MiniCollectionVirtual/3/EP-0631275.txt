<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head assembly, for use in a tape drive wherein a tape is moved past 
the head assembly in a longitudinal direction and the tape exhibits transverse tape 

movement correlated with the position of the tape in the longitudinal direction, and 
wherein a minimum longitudinal distance exists for which the correlation is maintained, 

has a carrier with first and second gap and coil arrangements (15,16) 
disposed on the carrier. 

The respective gaps (10,12) in the first and second gap and coil 
arrangements (15,16) are disposed on 

the carrier separated by a spacing (Drw) which is less than the 
aforementioned minimum 

longitudinal distance. If one gap and coil arrangement is used as a write arrangement, 
and the other gap and coil arrangement is used as a read arrangement for verifying the 

writing of data by the write arrangement, tracking errors are minimized, or substantially 
avoided, because the write and read arrangements are so close to each other as to be 

effectively at the same position in the context of the transverse tape movements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a magnetic head assembly of the type used
in a high-speed tape drive to transfer data to and from a magnetic tape moving past the
magnetic head assembly in the drive.In high-speed tape drives wherein data is transferred to and from a magnetic tape
moving at high speed in the drive, using a magnetic head assembly, the data are written
in a large number of closely adjacent, or overlapping, data tracks. The tracks extend in
a longitudinal direction parallel to the direction of tape transport, and are disposed side-by-side
in a direction perpendicular to the transport direction. In such systems, it is
known to employ the read head of the magnetic head assembly to verify the data which
has been written in a pass by the write head, so that any errors in tracking or data
transfer can be immediately identified, and corrective steps can be taken. A system
wherein the verification takes place in the same pass as the writing of the data is known
as a read-while-write system.It has been observed and experimentally confirmed by the present inventor that if
a track is recorded on a magnetic tape in a belt-driven cartridge using a write head, and
if the tape in the cartridge is then rewound to exactly the same position as where the
recording began and is then driven, the tape will exhibit the same transverse tape
movements (TTM) as the tape exhibited when the first track was recorded. Such
transverse tape movements occur in a direction substantially perpendicular to the
direction of tape transport. By means of a servo track or tape edge monitoring, the write
head can thus be made to precisely follow these transverse movements so that the 
"guard bands" between tracks can be made small to prevent overwriting from track-to-track
(or, if there is intentional track-to-track overtap, this overlap can be precisely
controlled). The details of this phenomenon, and supporting experimental data, are set
forth in the inventor's pending application entitled "Method and Apparatus for Improving
the Accuracy of a Tape Servo Track Seek Algorithm," Serial Number 08/034,573, filed in
the United States Patent and Trademark Office on March 19, 1993. The aforementioned
phenomenon can be summarized as a recognition that the tape transversal movements
are strongly correlated with the longitudinal tape position. A graphical representation of
such TTM as described in the aforementioned pending application is shown in Figure 1.
The correlation is very strong, except for a slow shift or drift in the
