<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing elemental 
sulfur which is present in a gas in the form of vapor and/or 

entrained particles, in which process the gas to be treated is 
cooled. The gas to be treated is introduced into a heat 

exchanger at the lower end thereof and with the aid of the 
temperature and/or the flow velocity of the cooling medium it 

is ensured that the wall of the heat exchanger has a 
temperature below the solidification point of sulfur and above 

the dew point of water, if any, present in the gas. The 

deposited sulfur is removed under the influence of gravity 
countercurrent to the gas to be treated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for removing 
elemental sulfur which is present in a gas in the form of 
vapor and/or entrained particles, in which process the gas to 
be treated is cooled. Various methods are known for removing sulfur-containing 
compounds from gas streams. A well known method is the 
so-called Claus process. According to this method, in a 
thermal stage hydrogen sulfide is partially oxidized with 
oxygen from the air to form sulfur dioxide. Then, in the 
thermal stage and two or three catalytic stages, the reaction 
occurs, whereby from the sulfur dioxide formed and the 
residual hydrogen sulfide, sulfur and water are formed. The 
sulfur recovery degree of the conventional Claus process is 
97-98% at a maximum. This percentage is relatively low in this 
branch of the technique, which gave rise to the need for 
methods by which the degree of recovery could be increased. With the recently developed SUPERCLAUS process, 
theoretically sulfur recovery percentages of up to 99.5% can 
be achieved. This process utilizes a reactor which is arranged 
downstream of two or three Claus reactors, and in which the 
residual hydrogen sulfide is selectively oxidized to sulfur. 
In practice, the SUPERCLAUS process in which the selective 
oxidation stage is implemented with gas which has passed three 
Claus reactors yields sulfur recovery percentages of about 
99.3%. It has been found that about 0.4% of the 0.7% residual 
sulfur in the tail gas of a SUPERCLAUS plant is present in the 
form of elemental sulfur, while the other sulfur compounds are 
mainly present in the form of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur 
dioxide. The efficiency loss in the sulfur recovery with the aid 
of a Claus plant, as a result of elemental sulfur which is 
present in the residual gas, is about 0.7-0.9% at a residual 
gas temperature of 150°C.  
 The official requirements regarding desulfurization 
efficiency are becoming increasingly stringent. The German 
authorities, for instance, require that sulfur recovery plants 
with a sulfur production exceeding 50 tons/day have a 
desulfurization efficiency of at least 99.5%. To further increase the practical efficiency of, for 
instance, a SUPERCLAUS plant, it is possible to resort to a 
different process, for instance the SCOT process. With the aid 
of this process, sulfur compounds which are still present in 
the Claus residual gas are removed with the aid of organic 
compounds. However, such a process is very costly, while the 
equipment for implementing this process is relatively
