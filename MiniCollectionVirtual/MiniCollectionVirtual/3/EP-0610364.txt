<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dewax process and 
especially relates to a non-chlorinated solvent dewax 
process. Electroplating is a common industrial technique. 
Often, the entire substrate is not electroplated and 
the part of a substrate not to be plated is masked. 
Commercially, the preferred choice of maskants is a 
wax material known in the industry as plater's wax. The plater's wax is typically applied by dipping 
the substrate to be masked in melted wax. So long as 
the substrate temperature is below the melting point 
of the wax, the wax will solidify on the substrate. Once the electroplating process is complete, the 
wax is removed from the substrate. One removal 
technique is a solvent dewax process. Conventionally, 
solvent dewax processes use chlorinated solvents, 
because they are non-flammable and effective. The 
chlorinated solvent is boiled in an enclosure (similar 
to a vapor degreaser) to cause a vapor layer to form 
above the solvent. The masked substrate is immersed 
in this vapor layer and the hot vapor condenses on the 
cool substrate, rinsing the surface, and removing the 
wax both by melting and dissolution. Although chlorinated solvent vapors are a 
traditional wax removal method, they present many 
disadvantages. The process produces toxic air 
emissions, environmentally hazardous waste, and the 
chlorinated solvents used are suspected carcinogens.  
 Another removal method is a hot melt process 
which removes the wax from the substrate by dipping 
the coated substrate into a bath of melted wax and 
allowing the substrate to heat up to the temperature 
of the hot wax. The elevated temperature causes the 
solid wax to melt off of the substrate. Any remaining 
wax is typically removed with chlorinated solvent as 
discussed above. An advantage of this process is that 
it recovers a substantial portion of the wax, thereby 
allowing reuse. A disadvantage of this melt removal process is 
that residue, such as metals and metal salts, from 
plating solutions used in the electroplating process, 
are also removed from the substrate, thereby 
contaminating the hot wax. Eventually, the hot wax 
contains sufficient contaminants that it is not suited 
for further use. Again, disposal is costly and 
inconvenient. Accordingly, the present invention teaches an 
environmentally sound, non-chlorinated solvent dewax 
process which allows the wax to be reused. The present invention relates to a dewaxing 
process for the removal of wax from substrates. The 
process comprises immersing the substrate

<CLAIMS>
A method for dewaxing a wax-coated 
substrate, which comprises the steps of: 


a. melting the wax coating; 
b. immersing said substrate in at least one hot 
mineral oil bath to remove any remaining wax; 
c. immersing said substrate in semi-aqueous 
cleaner to remove said mineral oil; 
d. immersing said substrate in alkaline-base 
cleaner to remove said semi-aqueous cleaner; and 
e. rinsing said substrate in at least one 
rinsing tank with a rinsing solution to remove said 

alkaline-base cleaner. 
A method as in claim 1 further including 
the step of immersing said substrate in a second mineral 

bath at the conclusion of step b. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein the 
substrate is immersed in a hot wax bath to melt the wax 

coating.
