<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel triazole 
compounds, their intermediates, and a method for the production 
of the same. Compounds having an isocyanate group, because of 
their excellent reactivity, have been widely used in the area of 
polymer chemistry. In particular, compounds having both a 
polymerizable carbon-carbon unsaturated group and an 
isocyanate group in same molecule can be used in a wide range of 
industrial areas because those functional groups will participate 
in various reactions under different reaction mechanisms. For 
good utilization of such useful features, the present inventors 
previously proposed an acyl isocyanate compound expressed by 
the following formula: 
 
where, R1 represents a lower alkyl group which may have a 
substituent)(Japanese Patent Application Sho 58-225226). The acyl isocyanate compound (5) is generally in the  
 
form of a liquid stable at ordinary temperatures and is easy to 
handle. The compound has a polymerizable carbon-carbon 
unsaturated group and an isocyanate group in its molecules and, 
in addition, it has a carbonyl group present between those two 
functional groups and in proximity thereto, so that not only is 
the activity of the carbon-carbon unsaturated group enhanced, 
but the activity of the isocyanate group is also enhanced and so 
that the compound is ready to perform a variety of addition 
reactions. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel compound derived from an alkyl acryloyl isocyanate 
represented by the following structural formula (5): 
 
(wherein R1 represents a lower alkyl group which may have a 
substituent group), in which the acyl isocyanate group is 
converted into a triazole group, with the carbon-carbon 
unsaturated group being retained as it is. More specifically, the invention relates to a triazole 
compound represented by the formula (1):  
 
 
wherein R1 represents a C1-6 alkyl group; R2 and R3 represent 
respectively hydrogen, an aryl group, a benzoyl group, a tosyl 
group, a C1-8 alkoxy carbonyl group, or an aryl sulfonyl group, 
each of which except for hydrogen may have a substituent 
selected from methyl, ethyl, propylbutyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 
methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, butoxyethyl, hexyloxyethyl, 
methoxy, nitro, chloro and bromo; provided that when R2 is 
hydrogen, the triazole compound is represented by the formula 
(2); 
 
wherein R1 and R3 are the same as defined above. The invention relates to a triazole compound represented 
by the formula (1): 
In the formula (1), R1 represents
