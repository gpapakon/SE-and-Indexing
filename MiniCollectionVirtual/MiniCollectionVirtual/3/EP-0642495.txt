<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF 4,4'-THIOBIS PHENOLSField of the InventionThis invention relates to a process for the production of 4,4'-thiobis(2,6-dialkyl) phenols by the reaction of 2,6- dialkylphenols with sulfur to produce the desired product in high yields and purity.Background Art4,4'-thiobis(2,6-dialkyl)phenols are known compounds useful in various areas. For example, 4,4'-thiobis(2,6- di-t-butyl)phenol is a well known antioxidant and an effective synergist for other antioxidants. It is known from U.S. Patent 3,835,196 to prepare compounds of this type by reacting 2,6-di-t butylphenol with an excess of sulfur in a solvent under basic conditions. This patent indicates that the solvent can be any solvent which would not react with the basic materials of the final product. Alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol as well as solvents such as pyridine, dimethylformamide and dimethyl acetamide are indicated as preferred. Mixtures of these solvents in water in any proportions are indicated for use. In the specific example in this patent, the solvent was a 95% ethanol solution in water.The present invention provides an improved solvent system for production of desired and preferred products of this type in high yields and high purity. 

Summary of the InventionIt is accordingly one object of the present invention to provide a method for the preparation of thiobisphenols in high yield and good purity. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for the preparation of thiobisphenols by the reaction of dialkylphenols and sulfur in a solvent system which maximizes yields and purity.In satisfaction of the foregoing objects and advantages, there is provided by the present invention a process for the production of thiobisphenols of the formula:
 wherein x is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and R. and R2 are a straight or branch-chained alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms, preferably t-butyl which comprises reacting 2,6- dialkylphenol with sulfur in a solvent system comprising a mixture of water and an alcohol of the formula ROH wherein R is alkyl of 1-5 carbon atoms, and wherein said solvent contains at least 10 wt% water, the reaction being carried out by heating the phenol and sulfur at an elevated temperature, optionally in the presence of a basic reactant, cooling, removing unreacted sulfur and recovering the product in high yield and high purity.Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description thereof proceeds .The present invention provides an improved
