<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet head (2) for ejecting ink includes an 
ink passage (210) for supplying ink from an ink container (10) 

for containing ink; a filter chamber (211) in the ink 
passage, the filter chamber containing therein a 

filter (213); wherein the chamber has a cross-sectional 
area larger than that of the ink passage (210), and is 

provided with an inlet opening (216) in fluid communication 
with an inlet part of the ink supply passage (210) for 

supplying the ink from the ink container to the 
filter chamber (211) and an outlet opening (217) in fluid 

communication with an outlet part of the ink passage 
for supplying the ink out of the chamber; wherein 

the inlet opening and outlet opening are faced to a 
filter with a clearance, and the chamber is provided 

with bubble moving portion (219) for moving bubbles (251) away 
from the inlet opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
head
according to the preambles of claims 1 and 2, respectively,
for ejecting ink to effect recording, and an ink
jet recording apparatus provided with the same, more
particularly it relates to an ink supply system in an
ink jet head.An ink jet recording apparatus is provided
with a recording head (ink jet head) having a
plurality of ejection outlets (nozzles) for ejecting
the ink. If the ejection outlet is clogged, normal
recording is not possible.An improper ejection due to the clogging at
the ejection outlets occurs, for example, due to fine
foreign matters introduced from an ink supply system
when an ink container for containing ink having porous
material to retain the ink therein, is exchanged, due
to the foreign matter produced from the recording
material or the like directly attached to the ejection
side surface of the ink jet head, or due to the high
viscosity ink resulting from evaporation of the ink
solvent adjacent the ejection outlet when the
recording apparatus is kept unused for a long period.For this reason, the provision of means for
removing foreign matters from the ink in a path from 
an ink accommodator to an ejection outlet, is
desirable. A general method therefor is the provision
of a filter in the ink supply path to remove the
foreign matter.As a method for preventing the clogging of
the ejection outlets due to the external foreign
matters, a widely used method is a recovery process in
which the ink is sucked through the ink ejection
outlet to suck the foreign matters out.The sucking recovery process is advantageous
because it can remove fine bubbles in a common liquid
chamber or the like with which the plurality of
ejection outlets are in fluid communication, as well
as the foreign matters adjacent the ejection outlet.
If the bubbles exists in the common liquid chamber or
the like, the ejection pressure is undesirably
reduced.When the filter is used, the bubbles in the
ink supply path are moved with the supply of the ink
from the ink accommodator to the recording head with
the ink to the filter, so that they are concentrated
on the filter. When the recording head and an ink
cartridge is detachably mountable together the air
may be introduced upon the coupling of the recording
head and the ink cartridge. The bubbles may be
produced by the solved air in the ink by ambient
condition change or the like. The bubbles 
concentrated on the filter may obstruct ink flows
through the filter or clogs the filter intermittently
to make the ink supply
