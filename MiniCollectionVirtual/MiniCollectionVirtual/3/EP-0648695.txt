<ABSTRACT>
For singulating inhomogeneous materials pieces of material 
(32) are deposited onto a diverter conveyor (10). The 

conveyor path is interrupted by diverters (16) extending at 
obtuse angles across the path. The diverters (16) work the 

pieces of material (32) into a single file order and perform 
some spacing. The diverter conveyor (10) then deposits the 

pieces (32) onto an acceleration conveyor (44) having a 
velocity greater than the velocity of the diverter conveyor 

(10). The acceleration conveyor (44) transports the pieces 
(32) to a sensor unit while expanding the distance between 

the pieces (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system and a method for 
singulating pieces of material having different sizes and 
shapes. In order to facilitate recycling of used materials like 
plastic containers or machining scraps, the pieces of material 
first need to be separated. The same holds true with 
certain virgin materials such as ores and the like. Such pieces 
of material are typically inhomogeneous with respect to 
shape and size. Separation of the different pieces often requires 
that the pieces are presented one after another to an 
identification means such as a sensor in order to identify 
the pieces accurately. Identification of multiple pieces at 
the same time would be more difficult and, in some cases, 
currently impossible. Once identified, it is only feasible to 
separate the different pieces accurately if they are individually 
available to an injection system. The object of the invention is to provide a system and method 
for accurately singulating imhomogeneous pieces of material 
in order to make it easier to identify and separate these 
pieces. In accordance with the invention, this object is accomplished 
in the system of claim 1 and the method of claim 8. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are given in the 
dependent claims. Preferably the pieces of material are first deposited onto a 
cleat conveyor which is set at an incline so that the pieces 
of material not residing on a cleat will fall backwards. The  
 
cleat conveyorr deposits the pieces onto a cross conveyor 
which has a cross conveyor path perpendicular to the cleat 
conveyor path. There is a slight drop and slide between the 
cleat conveyor and cross conveyor. The cross conveyor then 
deposits the pieces onto a diverter system having a diverter 
conveyor moving the pieces along a path, which is interrupted 
by diverters extending at obtuse angles across the path. The 
diverter system works the pieces into a single file order and 
performs some spacing. The diverter conveyor then deposits 
the pieces onto an acceleration conveyor having a velocity 
greater than the diverter conveyor. The acceleration conveyor 
then transports the pieces to a sensor conveyor while expanding 
the distance between the pieces. The sensor conveyor 
then transports the pieces through a sensor for determining 
and then separating them. The combination of changes in direction 
and velocity singulates the pieces and spaces the 
pieces apart for sensing and separation. The invention is described in detail below with reference to 
the
