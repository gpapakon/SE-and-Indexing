<ABSTRACT>
Ski boot of the type including a shell (2) with 
overlapping flaps (3,4) to which at least one quarter (5) is 

articulated and with which a soft innerboot (6) is 
internally associable. The boot also has a semirigid tab (8) 

that can be gripped by the user and is at least partially 
interposed between the innerboot and the overlapping flaps. 

This tab allows the user to rapidly and easily open the 
flaps to allow better and easier insertion of the foot in 

the innerboot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ski boot, comprising 
a shell with overlapping flaps to which at least one quarter 
is articulated and with which a soft innerboot can be 
internally associated. Currently, these conventional ski boots have the 
drawback that they require the user to open out the ends of 
the flaps in order to open the front tongue of the innerboot 
and thus insert the foot inside it. Since the shell is obtained by injection-molding 
thermoplastic material, which has a given degree of 
rigidity, this operation is not easy, also because the user 
is usually wearing gloves in this situation. This problem worsens especially at low temperatures, 
when plastics tends to become more rigid. Furthermore, the quarter is usually secured at the 
upper overlap region of the shell flaps, creating further 
difficulties for inserting the foot due to the presence of 
the flaps of the quarter, which must also be kept open. The principal aim of the present invention is therefore 
to solve the described technical problems, eliminating the 
drawbacks of the mentioned prior art, by providing a ski 
boot, comprising at least one quarter articulated to a shell 
having overlapping flaps and comprising a soft innerboot, 
that allows the skier to rapidly and easily insert his foot 
inside said innerboot. Within the scope of the above aim, an important object 
is to provide a ski boot which allows optimum foot insertion 
even in case of low temperatures and if the user is wearing  
 
gloves. Another important object is to provide a ski boot which 
allows to achieve optimum distribution of efforts at the 
metatarsal region. Another object is to provide a ski boot which 
associates with the preceding characteristics that of 
allowing to vary its technical characteristics without 
specific mechanical devices. Another object is to provide a ski boot which is 
structurally simple and has low manufacturing costs. This aim, these objects and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a ski boot comprising 
at least one quarter articulated to a shell having 
overlapping flaps and a soft innerboot, characterized in 
that it further comprises a semirigid tab that can be 
gripped by the user and is at least partially interposed 
between said innerboot and said flaps. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the following detailed description 
of some particular but not exclusive embodiments, 
illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the 
accompanying

<CLAIMS>
Ski boot comprising at least one quarter (5) 
articulated to a shell (2,102) with overlapping flaps (3,4) 

having a soft innerboot (6,106), characterized in that it 
further comprises a semirigid tab (8,108,208,308) that can 

be gripped by the user and is at least partially interposed 
between said innerboot and said flaps. 
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said shell has a first flap (3) and a second flap (4) which 

can be moved mutually apart and can be mutually overlapped 
and secured during use, said soft innerboot (6,106) being 

provided with a tongue (7,107) at the front, said tab being 
interposed at least partially between said tongue of said 

innerboot and said first and second flaps of said shell. 
Ski boot according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said tab (8,108) has one end that can be rigidly coupled to 

said shell (2,102) at the toe region, partially protruding 
therefrom. 
Ski boot according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said tab (8) has, proximate to its upper perimetric edge 

(9), a grip means for the user, said grip means being 
constituted by at least one opening (10) formed transversely 

to said tab. 
Ski boot according to claim 4, characterized in that 
a movement of said tab (8) towards the tip of said shell (2) 

leads to the mutual spacing of said first (3) and second (4) 
flaps. 
Ski boot according to claim 5, characterized in that 
said at least one quarter (5) is articulated to said shell 

 
(2) by means of suitable studs (11) which slide within 

suitable first slots (12) formed on said shell so as to vary 
the flexibility when the height of said quarter varies. 
Ski boot according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said tab (108) is also 

associated with said tongue (107) of said innerboot (106). 
Ski boot according to claim 7, characterized in that 
said connection between said tab (108) and said tongue (107) 

occurs proximate to a user grip means (110) by providing a 
suitable second slot (113) formed longitudinally to said 

tab, a first lug (114) being slidingly associated at said 
second slot, said lug being rigidly coupled to said 

underlying tongue and protruding therefrom. 
Ski boot according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises means (115) for 

limiting the mutual spacing of said first (103) and second 
(104) flaps. 
Ski boot according to claim 9, characterized in 
that said means are constituted by a wing (115) which 

protrudes from the perimetric edge (116) of said first flap 
(103) towards said second flap (104), a third slot (117) 

being formed on said wing transversely to said shell, a 
second lug (118) being selectively slideable at said third 

slot, said second lug being rigidly coupled to the outer 
surface of said second flap and protruding therefrom. 
Ski boot according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises means (119) for 

temporarily locking the position of said tab (108) with 
respect to said first (103) and second (104) flaps. 
Ski boot according to claim 11, characterized in

(119) formed at the lateral edges (120) of said tab (108). 
Ski boot according to claim 12, characterized in 
that said plurality of notches (119) can be selectively 

arranged at the upper edge (121) of said shell (102) or at 
the lateral edges (122) of said first and second flaps, so 

as to allow to keep said tab in the preset open condition. 
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in
