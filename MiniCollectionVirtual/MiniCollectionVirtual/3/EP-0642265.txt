<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for generating X-ray images, in which a charge pattern corresponding to the intensity of the X-rays is generated on the surface of a photoconductor (1), which pattern is scanned line by line by means of a number of probes (41) which cover the charge of in each case adjoining scanning areas of the photoconductor comprising a number of lines and supply digital image values of the X-ray exposure which are dependent on the charge. The stripes extending in the line direction in this image are illuminated by the following measures   a) formation of correction values (Kn(x, yo)) for the picture elements of the picture lines (yo) at the edges of the scanning areas of the probes (41), the magnitude and the sign of the correction values being dimensioned in such a manner that the corrected picture values (Bkn(x, yo) resulting from the superposition of the correction values and the picture values (Bn(x, yo), of the individual probes correspond to the corrected picture values of the in each case adjacent probes. b) formation of intermediate values (Zn(x, y)) for the picture lines (y) located between the edges of the scanning areas of the probes by interpolation of the correction values (Kn (x, yo); Kn(x, yu)) which are allocated to the same probe, c) superposition of the correction values or, respectively, of the intermediate values and of the picture values for the purpose of generating corrected picture values for the picture lines of the scanning areas.   The invention also relates to an arrangement for carrying out the method.

A method of forming X-ray images, in which a charge pattern which
corresponds to the X-ray intensity is generated on the surface of a photoconductor (1),

which charge pattern is line-wise scanned by means of a number of probes (41) which
detect the charge in respective scanning zones of the photoconductor which adjoin one

another and which comprise several lines, said probes supplying digital image values
(B
n
(x,y)) of the X-ray image which are dependent on the charge,

   characterized in that it comprises the following steps:

a) formation of correction values (K
n
(x,y
o
)) for the pixels of the image lines (y
o
) at
the edges of the scanning zones of the probes (41), the absolute value and the sign of

the correction values being such that the corrected image values (B
kn
(x,y
o
)) of the
individual probes, resulting from the superposition of the correction values and the

image values (B
n
(x,y
o
), correspond to the corrected image values of the respective
neighbouring probes,
b) formation of intermediate values (Z
n
(x,y)) for the image lines (y) situated
between the edges of the scanning zones of the probes by interpolation of the correction

values (K
n
(x,y
o
); K
n
(x,y
u
)) associated with the same probe;
c) superposition of the correction values, or the intermediate values and the image
values in order to produce corrected image values for the image lines of the scanning

zones.
A method as claimed in Claim 1,

   characterized in that the probes (41) are guided across the surface of the
photoconductor (1) in such a manner that the scanning zones of both probes overlap and

that the correction values are derived each time from the image values of an image line
(y
o
 or y
u
) scanned by neighbouring probes.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,

   characterized in that prior to the formation of the correction values the
effect of signal peaks (P) in the image lines (y
u
, y
o
) at the edges of the scanning zone is
suppressed, preferably by way of a median filtering operation (103a) in the line 

direction.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,

   characterized in that a low-pass filtering operation (103b) is performed in
the line direction before the correction values, or the intermediate values derived

therefrom, are used to form corrected image values.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,

   characterized in that the correction values are formed in such a manner
that the correction values of neighbouring probes have the same absolute value but the

opposite sign for the same pixel or for neighbouring pixels.
A device for carrying out the method claimed in Claim 1, comprising a
photoconductor (1) on the surface of which a charge pattern corresponding to the local

X-ray intensity is generated, a number of probes (41) which scan the charge line-wise in
a respective scanning zone on the surface of the photoconductor and supply electric

signals which are dependent on the charge on the surface, and also comprising means
for converting the signals into image values which are dependent on the charge in the

pixels,

   characterized in that it comprises

a) means for forming correction values (K
n
(x,y
o
)) for the pixels of the image lines
(y
o
) at the edges of the scanning zones of the probes (41), the absolute value and the
sign of the correction values being such that the corrected image values (B
kn
(x,y
o
)) of
the individual probes, resulting from the superposition of the correction values and the

image values (B
n
(x,y
o
), correspond to the corrected image values of the respective
neighbouring probes,
b) means for forming intermediate values (Z
n
(x,y)) for the image lines (y) situated
between the edges of the scanning zones of the probes by interpolation of the correction

values (K
n
(x,y
o
), K
n
(x,y
u
)) associated with the same probe,
c) means for superposing the correction values, or the intermediate values, and the
image values in order to produce corrected image values for the image li
nes of the
scanning zones.
