<ABSTRACT>
A continuous, automated method and apparatus for 
transporting and and processing articles (12) such as 

electro-statically coating them includes providing a 
plurality of articles (12) in an unoriented bulk state, 

each article having a first end portion, orienting each 
article (12) in means (14) and transporting them into a 

desired position (40), transferring each article (12) in 
succession to a moving conveyor (22, 24) by means (18), 

suspending each article (12) from the conveyor (22, 24) by 
its end portion and conveying the articles (12) for 

electro-static coating in means (28) and curing in means 
(32, 34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for 
transporting articles from an unoriented bulk to an 
oriented state for processing by, for example, applying 
a powder coating by an electro-static process, and more 
particularly to a method and apparatus for mass producing 
coated fasteners, such as screws, where substantially the 
entire exterior surface of the fastener is provided with 
uniform coverage of the coating. Coating of articles or components frequently is 
desirable to provide a protective layer of material on the 
exterior surfaces of the components for a variety of 
reasons, including protecting against corrosion. In order 
to provide such a coating, however, a portion of the 
component typically remains uncoated. For example, coating of components can be provided in 
a batch process by what is known as a "dip and spin" 
method. With this method a plurality of components are 
dipped or mixed within a vessel containing the desired 
coating. Upon removal, the components tend to stick or 
adhere together, and, when spun and dried, must be 
separated leaving uncoated portions on the components where 
they previously were adhered. Alternatively, a component can be held by a mechanism 
while the coating is applied. Upon release, however, the 
portion of the component held by the mechanism remains 
uncoated. Uncoated portions on components particularly are a 
problem with coating fasteners such as screws, nails, 
rivets or the like. Such fasteners are difficult to hold 
due to their shapes and typically require coating on their 
entire exterior surfaces. Fasteners are either batch processed or held as 
described above and usually have undesirable uncoated 
portions thereon. If such fasteners are to be held while 
the coating is applied, they frequently are held by their  
 
heads which does not receive a layer of coating. Uncoated 
fastener heads are not desirable since in use the heads 
frequently are exposed to the elements. An example of a coating apparatus which holds or 
contacts the heads of fasteners is illustrated in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,025,750. That patent discloses a method and 
apparatus for coating a fastener having a head portion and 
a shank portion where the fasteners are supported on their 
head portions, are heated to a desired temperature and the 
protective coating is applied only to the shank portion of 
the fastener. Fasteners or other components also can be coated using 
an electro-static process where powder particles are 
electro-statically charged as they exit a spray

A continuous automated method of transporting articles 
from unoriented bulk to an oriented state for processing, 

comprising the steps of: 
   providing a plurality of articles in an unoriented 

bulk state, each article having an end portion; 
   orienting and transporting each of said articles into 

a desired position; 
   transferring each of said articles in succession from 

said desired position to a moving conveyor; 
   suspending each of said articles on said conveyor from 

said end portion thereof; and 
   conveying said articles for processing. 
The method as defined in claim 1, wherein said 
articles are composed of a ferro-magnetic material and said 

step of suspending includes magnetically holding each 
article by said end portion. 
The method as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
end portion substantially forms a point on said article and 

each article is magnetically suspended by said point. 
The method as defined in any preceding claim, wherein 
said step of transferring includes transferring and 

magnetically holding each of said articles in succession on 
a respective portion of a continuously rotating feed wheel. 
The method as defined in any preceding claim, 
including electrically grounding each article during 

conveying. 
The method as defined in any preceding claim, 

including shielding each article from direct contact with 
said conveyor. 
An apparatus for electro-statically coating fasteners 
(12), comprising: 

   vibratory bowl means (14) for accepting a plurality of 
unoriented bulk fasteners (12) therein, for aligning said

succession to a first position (40) where they are held one 
behind the other; 

   rotating feed wheel means (18) positioned proximate 
said first position (40) for successively individually 

accepting and holding each fastener (12) at a respective 
portion thereon and for transporting each fastener (12) to

   moving conveyor means (22, 24) for releasably 

retaining each fastener (12) at a respective portion 
thereon and for conveying each fastener (12) to a number of 

different processing positions (28, 32, 34); and 
   transfer means (61) proximate said second position for 

moving each fastener (12) in succession from said second 
position of said feed wheel means (14) to said conveyor 

means (22, 24).

each fastener (12) includes a shank portion having first 

and second ends, said first end being tapered to a point 
and said second end being formed to include a head portion, 

said conveyor means releasably retaining each fastener by 
said first pointed end of said shank. 
The apparatus as defined in claim 9, wherein each 
fastener is made from a ferro-magnetic material and said 

conveyor means (22, 24) magnetically releasably retains
