<ABSTRACT>
Road data is stored in hierarchically organized levels. A lower level has detailed representations of road links and junctions. At a globalized level an abstracted representation is derived: a set of elementary junctions is joined to a complex junction on the basis of predetermined coherencies among the elements of the set. This repeats until all complex junctions have been found. All external road links between a border element of a particular set and any element of a particular neighbouring set are detected, including allowed traffic directions on the external road links. The links are collected to a single complex road link while mapping the allowed traffic directions thereon. This repeats until all complex road links have been found. Remaining elementary and complex junctions are represented by a respective single node. Also, each remaining elementary and complex road link is represented by a single higher level road link.

<DESCRIPTION>
System for joining elements to complex junctions and links in road network representation for vehicles.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a method for storing geographical road data in multiple hierarchically organized levels by from a relatively lower level that features detailed representations of road links and junctions, deriving at a relatively globalized level an abstracted representation from such detailed representations. United States Patent 4,914,605 describes the representing for display of a road map. Various roads in such road map have a level identifier, highways having a higher level identifier, main roads having a middle level identifier, and secondary roads having a lower level identifier. The number of levels is in principle arbitrary. For visual representation, the display scale is variable. At a big magnification factor, only a small geographical area is displayed, showing all roads therein. At an intermediate magnification factor, a relatively larger geographical area is displayed, showing only roads of the two higher levels therein. At a small magnification factor, a relatively still larger geographical area is displayed, showing only the top level roads therein.The present inventors have encountered a need for representing not only roads, but also complex intersection patterns between roads in a simplified manner, in such a way that conformance between various representation levels remains guaranteed. Such representation need not necessarily imply visual representation, but may be limited to representing in a data base. On an abstracted level the system will then represent a complex interchange, intersection, fly-over or similar structure as an apparent level crossing, with an appropriate number of links, at a price of giving up some accuracy as to the correct geometry of various elements. For an application requiring detailed decisions the system still retains the correct references to the detailed level. For example, the abstracting operation may shrink a particular loop to a single point, which influences the apparent distance between two geographical positions when the intermediate path would have passed the loop. In fact, calculating a distance with an exact representation will often yield a larger value, than when the abstracted representation is taken at its face. For certain usages, the discrepancy is irrelevant such as for long-distance route planning. For other applications, such as the giving of detailed instructions to a driver on what to do at the

CLAIMS:
1. A method for storing geographical road data in multiple hierarchically organized levels by from a relatively lower level that features detailed representations of road links and junctions, deriving at a relatively globalized level an abstracted representation from such detailed representations, characterized by the steps of: a. at such lower level, joining a set of elementary junctions to a complex junction on the basis of predetermined coherencies among the elementary junctions of the set; b. repeating step a. until all complex junctions have been found; c. ascertaining all border elements of a particular set and all elementary extemal links between those border elements and any element of one particular other set, inclusive of all allowed traffic directions on such elementary extemal road links, and collectively replacing said elementary extemal road links by a single complex extemal road link while mapping said allowed traffic directions thereon; d. repeating step c. until all complex extemal road links between sets so paired have been found; e. representing each remaining elementary junction and each complex junction by a respective single node, while representing each remaining elementary external road link and each complex external road link by a single higher level road link with associated original or mapped traffic directions, respectively. 2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 , wherein each single higher level road link is represented by a straight line.
3. A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein said representing is effected on a visual display.
4. A method as claimed in Claims 1 , 2 or 3, wherein said ascertaining with respect to a particular complex junction comprises searching in the associated set of elementary junctions for an allowable traffic path that connects an ingoing allowed traffic direction on a first higher level road link to an outgoing allowed traffic direction on a second higher level road link, but if disallowed retaining an inhibiting qualifier for the associated higher level road link pair of the associated complex junction.

5. A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the length of a higher level complex road link is set to an average length of the associated elementary road links plus a size value of one or both sets of elementary junctions interconnected thereby.
6. A method as claimed in any. of Claims 1 to 5, wherein said joining comprises executing successive and looped expanding steps from entrance junctions to follower junctions and exit junctions, and backwards from all exit junctions to preceder junctions and entrance junctions, until detecting an ultimate termination of said expanding, whereby all junctions found in said expanding are comprised in the associated set.
