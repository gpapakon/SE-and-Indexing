<ABSTRACT>
A railroad maintenance machine for correcting the position of the track has a machine frame (7), which is supported on rail running gear and equipped with lining drives (13) for lateral correction of the track position, and measuring carriages (recording cars) (24-26) capable of rolling on a track. These measuring carriages form, together with the machine frame (7) serving as reference basis and also with measurement transducers (32,33,34), a reference system (30) for detection of the actual track position. The measuring carriages (24,26), situated at the front and at the rear end of the reference system (30) in relation to the working direction, are assigned respective banking measurement devices (37,38). In addition, a pressure transducer (39) for detection of the lining forces of the lining drives (13) is provided.

A track maintenance machine for correcting the track geometry,
comprising a machine frame (7) supported on on-track undercarriages and

having lining drives (13) for lateral track geometry correction, and measuring
trolleys (24-26), designed to roll on a track, which together with the machine

frame (7) serving as reference base and measuring sensors (32,33,34)
form a reference system (30) to determine the actual position of the track,

characterized in that respective lateral inclination measuring devices (37,38)
are associated with the measuring trolleys (24,26) located at the front

and the rear end of the reference system (30) with respect to the working
direction, and a pressure sensor (39) is provided to determine the lining

forces of the lining drives (13).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the pressure
sensor (39) is coupled with a measuring sensor (33) of a measuring trolley

(25) situated in the region of the lining drive (13) for automatic zero value
adjustment in dependence on the lining force.
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a vertical
extension (40) of the machine frame (7) is connected in each case to a

measuring sensor (32-34), designed as a rotary potentiometer with a
measuring sensor cable (35), the measuring sensor cable (35) of the said

measuring sensor being connected to the respective measuring trolley
(24-26), forming an attachment point (36).
A machine according to claim 3, characterized in that all the
attachment points (36) of the measuring sensor cables (35) to the measuring

trolley (24,25,26) are positioned at the same height - relative to a horizontal
reference plane formed by the wheel contact points of the on-track

undercarriages (2,3).
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
provided both at the front and at the rear end of the machine frame (7) is

a device (28,29), connected to the said machine frame, for measuring the
lateral inclination. 
A method for determining lateral track geometry errors by means
of measuring sensors associated with a reference system of a track

maintenance machine according to claim 1, characterized in that zero
settings of the measuring sensors are compensated in dependence on

the lateral inclination of the track and the lining force for lateral track
displacement.
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that the zero settings
are additionally compensated in dependence on twisting of the machine

frame (7).
