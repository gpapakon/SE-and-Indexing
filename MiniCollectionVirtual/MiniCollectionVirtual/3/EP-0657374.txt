<ABSTRACT>
Supporting-roll winding machine with at least two winding stations, in which a web is wound onto a core in a way known per se in the first winding station, whilst a second winding station precedes the first in such a way that, at least at the moment when the web is cut, the latter is thus guided over a cutting and guiding roll (1') of the second station, the cutting and guiding roll (1') being designed as a suction roll, that, after the cut has been made, on the one hand the web end is wound over a cutting and guiding roll (1) of the first winding station, likewise designed as a suction roll, and, on the other hand, the web start is guided from the cutting and guiding roll (1') of the second station to its winding region, whereupon the first winding station is moved out of its position and the second winding station is brought into the position of the first winding station, while it is winding, and an empty winding station prepared for winding, which can also again be the first emptied winding station, is brought into the position of the originally second winding station, at the same time the winding stations (1, 1') being caused to pivot in such a way that a supporting roll (2) of the station which has just been winding is arranged horizontally.

<CLAIMS>
Carrier-roller winder having at least two winding 
stations, each winding station having a carrier, cutting 

and guide roller (1, 1'), a carrier roller (2) and a 
pressure roller (3), and in the first winding station, in 

a manner which is known per se, a web is wound onto a 
core, whilst a second winding station is connected 

upstream from the first, characterized in that, at least 
at the moment the web is cut, this is led over a carrier, 

cutting and guide roller (1') of the second station, the 
carrier, cutting and guide roller (1') being configured 

as a suction roller, such that, once the cut is 
completed, on the one hand the web end is wound over a 

carrier, cutting and guide roller (1) of the first 
winding station, which is likewise designed as a suction 

roller, and on the other hand the web beginning is led 
from the carrier, cutting and guide roller (1') of the 

second station to its wind-up zone, whereupon the first 
winding station is removed from its position and the 

second winding station is brought, as it continues 
winding, into the position of the first winding station, 

and an empty winding station, which is prepared for 
winding and which can also once again be the first 

emptied winding station, is brought into the position of 
the originally second winding station, each of the 

winding stations herein being able to be swivelled such 
that the axis of the carrier, cutting and guide roller 

(1) and the axis of the carrier roller (2) of that 
station which is currently winding are located in a 

common horizontal plane. 
Carrier-roller winder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the carrier-roller winder comprises 

two to six winding stations. 
Carrier-roller winder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the winding material is held by at 

least one pressure roller (3). 
Carrier-roller winder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the entire system comprising at 

least two winding stations is disposed rotatably about an  
 

axis (A). 
Carrier-roller winder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, as the cutting takes place, a 

toucher strip (4) or a batch identification can be 
applied to the cutting and guide roller (1'). 
Carrier-roller winder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that winding stations which are not 

directly involved in the winding operation can be disabled, 
emptied, loaded and speeded back up to web speed. 
Process for the winding of webs, characterized in 
that a carrier-roller winder according to one of Claims 

1 - 6 is used, in particular for the continuous winding 
onto cores and, quite especially, for the winding of webs 

which are supplied on one side with a self-adhesive 
coating.
