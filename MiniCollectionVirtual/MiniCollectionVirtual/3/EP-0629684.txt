<ABSTRACT>
The process produces a stream of hot clean gas 
substantially free from particulate matter, alkali metal 

compounds, hydrogen halides, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur-containing 

gases, and with or without ammonia for use as 
synthesis gas, reducing gas, or fuel gas. A pumpable fuel 

selected from liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuel or liquid 
emulsions thereof, an aqueous slurry of petroleum coke, 

and mixtures thereof and containing halides, alkali metal 
compounds, sulfur, nitrogen and inorganic ash, it reacted 

by partial oxidation to produce a hot raw gas stream 
comprising H₂, CO, CO₂, H₂O, CH₄, NH₃, HCN, HC1, HF, H₂S, 

COS, N₂, Ar, particulate matter, vapor phase alkali metal 
compounds, and molten slag. The hot raw gas stream is 

cooled and cleaned. Optionally, ammonia is removed by 
being catalytically disproportionated into N₂ and H₂. The 

process gas stream is cooled and halides and HCN in the 
gas stream are reacted with a supplementary alkali metal 

compound to remove HC1, HF and HCN. Alkali metal halides 
and alkali metal cyanide, vaporized alkali metal compounds 

and residual fine particulate matter are removed by 
further cooling and filtering. The sulfur-containing 

gases in the process gas stream are then reacted at high 
temperature with a mixed metal oxide sulfur sorbent 

material to produce a sulfided sorbent material which is 
then separated from the hot clean purified gas stream 

having a temperature of at least 540°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a partial oxidation process for
producing hot clean synthesis, reducing, or fuel gas substantially
free from entrained particulate matter and gaseous impurities
including halides, vapor phase alkali metal compounds, sulfur,
hydrogen cyanide, and with or without ammonia.The partial oxidation process is a well known process for
converting liquid hydrocarbonaceous and solid carbonaceous fuels
into synthesis gas, reducing gas, and fuel gas. See coassigned
US-A- 3,988,609; 4,251,228, 4,436,530, and 4,468,376 for
example. The removal
of fine particulates and acid-gas impurities from synthesis gas is
described in coassigned US-A- 4,052,175, 4,081,253, and
4,880,439; and in 4,853,003; 4,857,285; and 5,118,480. However, the aforesaid
references, as a whole, do not teach nor suggest the subject
process for the production of hot clean synthesis gas, reducing
gas, and fuel gas which are substantially free from particulate
matter, halides, hydrogen cyanide, alkali metal compounds, sulfur-containing
gases and with or without ammonia. By the subject
process, synthesis gas, reducing gas, and fuel gas having a
temperature in the range of about 540°C to 700°C (1000°F to 1300°F) are produced.
Gas produced by the subject process for burning, e.g., fuel gas in 
the combuster of a gas turbine, will not contaminate the
atmosphere. Gas produced for use as a synthesis gas will not
deactivate the synthesis catalyst.The subject process relates to a partial oxidation
process for the production of a stream of hot clean gas
substantially free from particulate matter, halides, hydrogen
cyanide, alkali metal compounds, sulfur-containing gases, fly-ash
and/or molten slag for use as synthesis gas, reducing gas, or fuel
gas comprising:
(1) reacting a pumpable hydrocarbonaceous fuel feedstock by partial
oxidation with a free-oxygen containing gas wherein said
hydrocarbonaceous fuel feedstock is selected from the group
consisting of liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuel or liquid emulsions
thereof, an aqueous slurry of petroleum coke, and mixtures thereof,
and wherein said fuel contains halide, alkali metal compounds,
sulfur, nitrogen and inorganic ash containing components, and said
fuel is reacted with a free-oxygen containing gas in a free-flow
vertical refractory lined partial oxidation gas generator to
produce a hot raw gas stream having a temperature in the range of
about 980°C to 1650°C (1800°F to 3000°F) and comprising H2, CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, NH3,
HCN, HC1, HF, H2S, COS, N2, Ar and containing particulate matter,
and
