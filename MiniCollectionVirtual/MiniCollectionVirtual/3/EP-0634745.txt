<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus comprises a unit for storing a large number of discs; a unit for recording and/or reproducing in 
which a disc is selectively mounted from among the discs stored in a plurality of storing parts provided in the storing 

unit; and a mechanism for transferring a disc stored in a given storing part to the recording and/or reproducing unit 
from among the discs stored in the storing unit. The transferring mechanism detects whether or not discs are stored in 

the storing unit in the course of disc transfer. In the storing parts, the discs are vertically arranged. A disc in a storing 
part is transferred by the tranferring mechanism to the reproducing unit with its posture vertical, and is mounted on 

the unit. This apparatus has group specifying means for grouping recording medium discs stored in the storing unit 
based on information recorded on desired recording medium discs or tune information recorded on desired recording 

medium discs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing
apparatus for a disc-shaped recording medium, such as an optical
disc or a magneto-optical disc. More particularly, it relates
to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus for a disc-shaped
recording medium having an exchange function of disc-shaped
recording media in which one of the disc-shaped recording media
is selectively taken out from a container unit containing a large
number of the disc-shaped recording media and information signals
recorded on the thus taken out recording medium, such as music
signals, are reproduced from the disc-shaped recording medium,
or the information signals, such as music signals, are recorded
on the disc-shaped recording medium.In general, a disc reproducing apparatus in which one of
disc-shaped recording media, such as replay-only optical discs,
is taken out of a disc housing unit housing a large number of the
optical discs, and the information signals, such as music
signals, recorded on the optical disc, are reproduced, includes,
in addition to the disc housing unit housing a large number of
the optical discs, a disc transporting mechanism for selectively
transporting the sole optical disc housed within the disc housing
unit, and a reproducing unit for reproducing the information
signals recorded on the optical disc transported by the disc
transporting mechanism. The reproducing unit of the disc reproducing apparatus
includes a disc rotating mechanism holding the sole optical disc
selected from the disc housing unit and an optical pickup unit
movable along the radius of the optical disc rotated by the disc
rotating mechanism for reproducing the information signals, such
as music sound signals, recorded on the optical disc.Besides, the reproducing unit includes, in addition to the
disc transporting mechanism for delivering the sole optical disc
as selected from a large number of the optical discs housed
within the disc housing unit, to the disc table for loading and
a clamp mechanism for clamping the optical disc thus transported
by the disc transporting mechanism onto the disc table for
rotation in unison with the disc table.For selecting the optical disc reproduced by the reproducing
unit, the disc housing unit housing a large number of the optical
discs is moved for moving a desired optical disc to a position
registering with the disc transporting mechanism and the optical
disc is then taken out of the disc housing unit by the disc
transporting mechanism. Alternatively, the disc housing unit is
moved to a
