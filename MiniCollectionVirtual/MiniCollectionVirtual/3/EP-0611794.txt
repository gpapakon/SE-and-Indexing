<ABSTRACT>
A method for improving the expandability of styrenic polymer 
particles is disclosed. The method comprises copolymerizing a 

styrenic monomer with an amount of an acrylate monomer effective 
to improve the expandability of the particles without adversely 

affecting their heat sensitivity. Polymer foams of low density 
can be prepared with reduced amounts of blowing agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation of styrenic polymer 
particles useful for making foams. In particular, the invention 
is a process for improving the expandability of styrenic polymer 
particles by incorporating an effective amount of an acrylate 
monomer into the expandable polymer particles. Styrenic polymer foams are produced commercially by extrusion 
and foaming of molten polymers, or by expansion and molding of 
polymer particles. Blowing agents such as pentane are routinely 
used to expand the polymers to produce foams. Increasingly tough 
legislation limits allowable emissions of volatile organic 
compounds (VOC), so foam manufacturers need ways to foam polymer 
particles with reduced levels of blowing agents. Polystyrene particles having improved expandability can be 
prepared by polymerizing styrene in aqueous suspension in the 
presence of chain-transfer agents or styrene oligomers. The 
method of Hahn et al. (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,525,484, 4,520,135, and 
4,513,105) illustrates this approach. A chain-transfer agent, 
such as n-dodecyl mercaptan, is introduced during styrene 
polymerization. The polymer product has a reduced proportion of 
very high molecular weight polystyrene, and has improved  
 
expandability compared with products made in the absence of the 
chain-transfer agent. Additional routes to styrenic polymer particles with improved 
expandability are needed. A desirable approach would eliminate 
the need for introducing a chain-transfer agent at a particular 
stage of the polymerization. Ideally, the method would give 
high-quality styrenic polymer particles having improved 
expandability at little or no added cost. In addition, the heat 
sensitivity of the polymer particles, i.e., the tendency of the 
particles to shrink during pre-expansion, would be minimized. The invention is a method for improving the expandability of 
styrenic polymer particles. The method comprises copolymerizing, 
in an aqueous suspension, a styrenic monomer and an acrylate 
monomer, wherein the acrylate monomer is used in an amount 
effective to improve the expandability of the particles without 
adversely affecting their heat sensitivity. The acrylate monomer 
is preferably used in an amount within the range of about 0.1 to 
about 10 weight percent based on the amount of styrenic monomer. The invention also includes a method for making styrenic 
polymer particles having improved expandability that uses a 
"seeded particle" approach. This method comprises 
copolymerizing, in an aqueous suspension,
