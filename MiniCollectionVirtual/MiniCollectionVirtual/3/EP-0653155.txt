<ABSTRACT>
A fishing lure is provided which functions effectively in 
both horizontal and vertical directions of movement through 

water. The lure is built upon a stiff wire support (11), and has a 
buoyant member (54), spinner unit (12), weight member (40) 

and lower attractor 
member (50) disposed in sequence from top to bottom, respectively, 

upon the wire support (11). The relative effectiveness of the buoyant 
member (54) is selected in association with the weight member (40) and 

other components such that the lure, when falling through water, 
assumes a vertical attitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns fishing lures, and more 
particularly relates to a fishing lure which functions 
effectively in both horizontal and vertical directions of 
movement. Fishing lures which function effectively in all directions 
of motion are disclosed in U. S. Patents 5,076,005 and 5,201,859 
issued to this inventor. Such lures are comprised of an 
elongated stiff wire shaft upon which is mounted a spinner 
device, a weight member, an attractor member, and fish hooks. 
When the lure moves through the water, the spinner device 
rotates. In vertical modes of motion, as when the lure is being 
retrieved vertically upward, or allowed to fall, the dynamics of 
the spinner are intended to stabilize the attitude of the lure so 
that it maintains a vertically aligned orientation. Without the 
spinner, the lure would tip ineffectually on its side upon 
falling. Examples of situations when vertical stabilization of the 
lure would be desirable include, but are not limited to, ice 
fishing, jigging over brush piles and along drop-offs and ledges, 
as well as during the count-down method of fishing; wherein, the 
cast lure is allowed to sink for a predetermined period of time 
to reach a certain depth before the lure is retrieved in the 
normal manner along a generally horizontal plane. Although the lures described in the aforesaid patents are 
generally effective, greater positional stabilization of the lure 
in vertical orientation is needed, especially when falling  
 
through the water. Greater versatility is also sought with 
respect to attractor members that may be associated with the 
lure. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to 
provide a fishing lure which functions effectively in all 
directions of movement through the water. It is another object of this invention to provide a fishing 
lure as in the foregoing objective which will have a controlled 
speed of descent and will minimize line twisting. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a 
lure adapted to accommodate different attractor members. It is a still further object of this invention to 
provide a lure of the aforesaid nature of durable construction 
and amenable to low cost manufacture. These and other beneficial objects and advantages are 
accomplished in accordance with the present invention by a 
fishing lure comprising: 
a) an elongated stiff wire support having an upper extremity 
provided with an eyelet and a lower extremity provided with 
a looped snap member, b) a spinner unit having 1 to

<CLAIMS>
A vertical retrieve fishing lure comprising: 

a) an elongated stiff wire support having an upper 
extremity provided with an eyelet and a lower extremity 

provided with a looped snap member, 
b) a spinner unit having 1 to 8 upwardly directed blades 
radially disposed around a hub element journaled to 

said wire support, 
c) upper and lower bearing members having central bores 
and rotatively mounted by virtue of said bores on said 

wire support above and below said spinner unit, respectively 
d) an offset keel shaped elongated weight member affixed 
securely to said wire support below said lower bearing 

member, 
e) a buoyant head having a centered channel and mounted by 
virtue of said channel on said wire support above said 

upper bearing member, 
f) a removable upper attractor member configured to 
embrace said weight member, and 
g) a removable lower attractor member and fish hook unit 
removably held by said looped snap member. 
The fishing lure of claim 1 wherein said hub element has a 
centered bearing bore of cylindrical contour having a length 

at least four times greater than its diameter. 
The fishing lure of claim 2 wherein the diameter of the bore 
of said hub is between .004 and .020 inch greater than the 

diameter of said wire support. 
The fishing lure of claim 1 wherein said upper attractor 
member is fabricated of soft plastic material. 
The fishing lure of claim 1 wherein the size, shape and 
degree of buoyancy of said buoyant head are chosen so that 

 
the combined effect of the weight member, spinner unit, and 

buoyant head is such as to dispose the lure in a stable 
vertical position when falling through water. 
The fishing lure of claim 5 wherein said bearing members are 
of spherical contour. 
The fishing lure of claim 6 further comprising a stop unit 
engaged by said wire between said lower bearing member and 

weight member. 
The fishing lure of claim 7 wherein said weight member has 
rounded extremities 
The fishing lure of claim 1 wherein said blades are 
concavely curved in the upward direction.
