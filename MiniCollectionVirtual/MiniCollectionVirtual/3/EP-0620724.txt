<CLAIMS>
Use for oral hygiene of a composition 
comprising at least one linear or crosslinked hydrocarbon 

polymer which is principally constituted by units with 
the following formula: 


 
where: 


R represents H or CH
2
OH, 
A represents an alkaline metal or an ammonium, 
amine or alkanolamine salt, the average frequency of the 

units corresponding to a carboxylate/hydroxymethyl ratio 
greater than 0.5 in the polymer, and
 
   a physiologically acceptable vehicle. 
Use according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the average degree of polymerization of said polymer is 

between 3 and 1 000, preferably 50 to 600. 
Use according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterized in that the average frequency of the units 

in the polymer corresponds to a carboxylate/hydroxymethyl 
ratio of between 1.1 and 16. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterized in that A represents Na in formula (Ia). 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that it contains 0.05% to 10% by weight 

of polymer with respect to the total composition weight. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterized in that it contains 0.1% to 5% by weight of 

polymer with respect to the total composition weight. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
characterized in that it is in the form of a gel or 

toothpaste, mouthwash, foam, gargle, powder, dental  
 

tablet or granules, dental spray, dental gel or chewing 
gum. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterized in that it further contains a polishing 

agent which is present in proportions of up to 95% by 
weight with respect to the total composition weight. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 8 
characterized in that it contains up to 20% by weight 

with respect to the total composition weight of anionic, 
non-ionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric or cationic 

surfactants. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 9 
characterized in that it contains at least one cohesive 

agent, thickener, sweetener, moistening agent, cooling 
agent, plasticizer, flavoring agent, aromatizing or 

peptizing agent or sweetener substance, palatabilizing 
agent, preservative, antibacterial agent, antibiotic 

agent, anticaries agent, vitamin, antitartar agent, dye, 
healing agent, vasomotor, clotting agent, active 

ingredient for gums, or active ingredient for inhibiting 
halitosis. 
Use of a linear or crosslinked hydrocarbon 
polymer which is principally constituted by units with 

the following formula: 

 
where: 


R represents H or CH
2
OH, 
A represents an alkaline metal or an ammonium, 
amine or alkanolamine salt, the average frequency of the 

units corresponding to a carboxylate/hydroxymethyl ratio 
greater than 0.5 in the polymer, and a physiologically  

 
acceptable vehicle, this composition being useful for 

treatment of the mouth. 
Use according to claim 11 characterized in 
that the treatment is cosmetic or therapeutic. 
Cosmetic method of protecting natural or 
artificial teeth against stains, adhesion of exogenous 

substances and dental plaque characterized in that an 
effective quantity of a composition is applied to the 

teeth and/or the gums, the composition comprising at 
least one linear or crosslinked hydrocarbon polymer which 

is principally constituted by units with the following 
formula: 


 
   where: 


R represents H or CH
2
OH, 
A represents an alkaline metal or an ammonium, 
amine or alkanolamine salt, the average frequency of the 

units corresponding to a carboxylate/hydroxymethyl ratio 
greater than 0.5 in the polymer, and
 
   a physiologically acceptable vehicle.
