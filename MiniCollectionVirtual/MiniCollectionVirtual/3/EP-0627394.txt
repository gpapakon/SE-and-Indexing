<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of branched olefins from a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock comprising 
linear olefins having at least four carbon atoms. One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to produce 
gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands on product 
quality and having a high octane number. This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now to 
be established without lead-containing additives, less aromatics, in 
particular benzene, less olefins and lower gasoline vapour pressure. Components which are suitable for improving the octane quality 
of gasoline are certain highly branched ethers, e.g. methyl tertiary 
butyl ether (MTBE). It is known that such ethers can be formed by 
contacting branched olefins, e.g. branched butenes, with methanol in 
the presence of a suitable acidic catalyst, such as sulphonic 
resins, phosphoric acid, modified kieselguhr, silica/alumina and 
acidic zeolites. A process for preparing branched butenes has for instance been 
described in US 5,146,035. In said disclosure it has i.a. been 
indicated that in a process for the isomerisation of butenes use can 
be made of a catalyst comprising a metal aluminophosphate as 
described in general terms in US 4,567,029. Surprisingly, it has now been found that an improved yield of 
branched olefins can be obtained if a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock 
comprising linear olefins having at least four carbon atoms is 
contacted with a catalyst comprising a medium-pore molecular sieve 
selected from a specific group of MeAPO and MeAPSO medium-pore 
molecular sieves. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of branched olefins comprising contacting a 
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock comprising linear olefins having at  
 
least four carbon atoms at elevated temperature with a catalyst 
which comprises a MeAPO and/or MeAPSO medium-pore molecular sieve 
having an anhydrous composition expressed in molar oxide ratios as 
follows; (MeO)a(Al2O3)b(P2O5)c(SiO2)d, whereby (a + b)/c is greater 
than 1.0, a ranges from 0.003 to 0.2, b and c range from 0.05 to 
0.3, d is at most 0.4 and a/(c + d) is at least 0.05 when SiO2 is 
present, and Me is at least one of Mg, Mn, Co and Zn. In this way a very attractive high yield of branched olefins can 
be obtained. In the context of the present invention a MeAPO medium-pore 
molecular sieve is defined as a crystalline microporous metal 
aluminophosphate composition having a three-dimensional framework
