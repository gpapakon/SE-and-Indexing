<ABSTRACT>
An improved Western blot method wherein the captured antibody of a test 
sample is detected by a probe specific for the captured antibody. The capture 

reagent can be a lysate, a recombinant protein or a synthetic peptide specific for the 
antibody to be detected. A test kit for performing the method also is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for determining the presence of 
a specific binding pair member, preferably an antibody, in a test sample, and more 
particularly, relates to the detection of a member of a specific binding pair in a test 
sample by an improved Western Blot assay. The human immune system responds to infections by generating antibodies 
to various antigens. The number of antibodies and the amount of each different 
antibody produced depends on the infectious agent and the particular antigen(s) 
which initiate the antibody (immune) response. The detection of an immune 
response to an infectious agent is an important method in in vitro diagnostics. 
This method is especially useful when detecting antibodies against these infectious 
agents in donated blood units, and when testing body fluids for the presence of 
these agents in order to diagnose acute and chronic infections. Such tests typically 
are initially performed by contacting a test sample such as a body fluid suspected 
of containing antibody to the agent of interest with a known antigen(s) obtained 
from the agent of interest. The antigen(s) usually is immobilized on a solid phase 
material to allow ease of separation from the test sample and for further treatment. 
Following incubation of the solid phase with the test sample, unbound materials 
are removed, and any bound antibody usually is detected by a second incubation 
with a specific anti-human immunoglobulin labelled with a detectable measurable 
label (a so-called conjugate). Following incubation, unbound materials are 
removed and the bound labelled complex is detected as a measure of the detectable 
signal. The antigens used in these initial tests (or so-called screening tests) may 
employ purified lysates or recombinant proteins. These screening tests, however, have known non-specific reactivities. 
See, for example, J. E. Menetove et al., Lancet:1213 (November 21, 1987); D. 
Barnes, Science 238:884-885 (1987); A. Puckett et al., Lancet:714 (March 26, 
1988). Some of the non-specificity is attributable to immunoreactivities with 
normal human antigens that are present in these lysates of the infectious agent. 
The normal human antigens (cellular protein impurities) originate from the tissue 
culture cells or other culture media that are used to propagate the infectious agent, 
and they are the major constituents of partially purified lysates. For example, the 
major surface antigen of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), gp120, and the 
HIV transmembrane
