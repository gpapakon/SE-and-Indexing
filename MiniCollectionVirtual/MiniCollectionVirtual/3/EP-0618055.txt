<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device of the above type with an internal mixer, and it is based on the object of improving the device in such a way that there is an improved distribution of the reactive additives without having to fear that excessively high temperatures will occur. To achieve this object, the internal mixer (1) forms a unit together with a weight-less internal mixer (2), the first internal mixer serving for plasticating the basic mixture (master batch) and these two internal mixers being connected to each other in such a way that the weight-less internal mixer can be charged directly from the first internal mixer, and moreover the weight-less internal mixer being the final mixer (for the ready-to-use mixture).

<CLAIMS>
Method of processing rubber mixtures, which contain
non-reactive additional substances, to form final rubber

mixtures by employing a ram-type masticator (1),
characterised in that the rubber mixture, which is to be

supplied to the ram-type masticator (1), is a previously
produced, final master batch, which is supplied to the

ram-type masticator (1) for plasticizing purposes, and
which, after the plasticizing process, is supplied as a

charge directly to a ramless masticator (2) in order to
effect the final mixing of the final mixture by adding

reactive additional substances at a lower temperature
compared with the ram-type masticator.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the mixing of the reactive additional substances with the

master batch is effected at such a low temperature that the
final mixture can be produced for stock.
