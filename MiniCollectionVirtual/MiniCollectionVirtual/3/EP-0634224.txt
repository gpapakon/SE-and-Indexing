<ABSTRACT>
A shaft seal (72) for a portable paint gun (10) with the seal having a radial 
clearance with the shaft except at a shaft sealing surface (100) of limited 

axial length. The shaft seal has a conical surface (102) radially outward 
of the shaft sealing surface to provide a sealing surface and also to provide 

transfer of axial forces at that surface to a radial direction to provide a 
force to urge the shaft sealing surface (100) against the control shaft. A 

second conical surface of the seal provides for retention of the seal on an 
air valve spring when the paint gun is disassembled. An improved air valve 

(60) for portable paint guns is also disclosed having a rigid axial hub (110) 
and radial suppprt (114) carrying a relatively flexible rim portion (116) 

adapted to engage a tapered seating surface (120) in the gun.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of 
portable painting equipment (see document US-A-4 560 109), more particularly to 
portable paint guns referred to as high volume low 
pressure or HVLP type paint guns. In the past, such 
guns have been characterized by relatively complex 
and costly sealing mechanisms to prevent the escape 
of pressurized air from the interior of such guns. 
The present invention provides an improved apparatus 
for preventing the escape of pressurized air in a 
simple and efficient structure. Figure 1 is a right side elevation view of 
a portable paint gun with parts cut away and with 
movable parts shown in an OFF position. Figure 2 is an enlarged side elevation 
detail of the shaft seal of the present invention. Figure 3 is an enlarged side elevation 
detail of an air valve for the gun. Figure 4 is a fragmentary right side 
elevation view as seen in Figure 1 with movable parts  
 
in an intermediate position. Figure 5 is a fragmentary right side 
elevation view with movable parts in an ON position. Referring now to the drawings and more 
particularly to Figure 1, a portable paint gun 10 may 
be seen. Gun 10 has a handle 12 which is preferably 
hollow, and through which compressed air can pass 
when connected to a source of compressed air via 
fitting 14. Gun 10 further has a paint cup 16 having 
a siphon tube 18 to draw paint out of paint cup 16 in 
operation. Gun 10 further has a trigger 20 pivotably 
mounted to a gun body 22 via a trigger pin 24. Gun 10 further has an air cap 26 retained by 
a locking ring 28 on body 22. An air cap spring 30 
is preferably secured to a detent plate 32, as for 
example, by spot welding. Detent plate 32 preferably 
has projections 34, 36 which are retained 
respectively in slots 38, 40 to prevent rotation of 
plate 32. Plate 32 preferably has a cruciform 
opening interdigitated with projections on plate 32 
(not shown) which are received in mating recesses 
(not shown) in air cap 26. The detents in plate 32 
and recesses in cap 26 cooperate to hold cap 26 in 
one of three predetermined positions to provide for 
control of the paint pattern in a manner well known. 
Gun 10 further has a fluid nozzle 42 which cooperates 
with a needle 44 to form a needle or paint valve 46 
to control the flow of paint or other material 
delivered by gun 10. A needle packing nut 48 is 
preferably threaded into body 22 to compress needle 
packing 50 against needle 44. Gun 10 also has an air passageway 52 in 
communication with a plenum 54 surrounding fluid  
 
nozzle

<CLAIMS>
Shaft seal in a portable paint gun of the type having a 
control shaft (58) for controlling a supply of pressurized air 

to atomize a selectively provided stream of paint, the shaft seal (72) comprising: 

a) a mediate portion (80) having a radially outwardly 
projecting flange (82) and a generally 

cylindrical interior recess (84) located radially 
inwardly of the flange (82); 
b) a first conical rim (86) extending axially in a 
first direction away from the flange (82) and 

having a shallow taper from a relatively thikker 
cross section proximal of the flange (82) 

to a relatively thinner cross section (90) distal 
of the flange (82) and having a first extension 

of the generally cylindrical interior recess 
(84) radially inwardly of the first conical rim 

(86); 
c) a cylindrical portion extending axially in a 
second direction opposite the first direction 

away from the flange (82) and having a second 
extension (96) of the generally cylindrical 

interior recess (84) extending axially along 
and radially inwardly of the cylindrical portion; 
d) a second conical rim (94) extending axially in 
the second direction from the cylindrical portion; 

and 
e) a conical inner surface (98) extending from the 
second extension of the generally cylindrical 

interior recess (84) to a cylindrical shaft sealing 
surface (100) located axially distal of the  

 
flange (82) in the second direction wherein the 

second conical rim (94) has a tapered sealing 
surface (102) adapted for interfitting and being in 

contact with a mating correspondingly tapered 
bore (104) in an element (74) of the paint gun 

such that the shaft seal (72) prevents the passage 
of air between the control shaft (58) and 

the shaft sealing surface (100) and between the 
sealing surface (102) and the-tapered bore (104). 
The shaft seal of claim 1 wherein the first conical rim 
(86) is adapted to mate in an interference fit with a 

generally cylindrical compression spring (70) acting axially 
against the flange (82) to urge the seal in the second 

direction with respect to the control shaft (58). 
The shaft seal of claim 2 wherein the first conical rim 
has a conical taper of about ten degrees. 
The shaft seal of claim 2 or 3 wherein the first conical 
rim (86) tapers from about 5.79 mm (0.228 inches) diameter to about 

7.90 mm (0.311 inches) diameter and the spring has an internal diameter 
of about 8.03 mm (0.316 inches). 
The shaft seal of any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the tapered 
sealing surface (102) of the second conical rim (94) 

has a taper substantially equal to a taper of the conical 
inner surface. 
The shaft seal of any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the cylindrical 
interior recess has a diameter substantially 

greater than a diameter of the control shaft around which 
the seal is located such that there is a radial clearance 

between the shaft and the cylindrical interior recess and 
further wherein the shaft sealing surface has an axial  

 
length that is relatively short with respect to an axial 

lenght of the overall shaft seal such that the resistance 
to relative axial movement between the shaft and the seal 

is minimized. 
The shaft seal of any of claims 1 to 6 wherein the shaft 
seal is formed of resilient material. 
The shaft seal of claim 7 wherein the shaft seal is formed 
of polytetrafluorethylene. 
The shaft seal of any of claims 1 to 8 wherein the tapered 
sealing surface has a conical taper of about thirty 

degrees. 
The shaft seal of claim 9 wherein the conical inner surface 
has an internal conical taper which is substantially 

equal to the taper of the conical sealing surface and, 
particularly, is about thirty degrees. 
The shaft seal of claim 10 wherein the internal conical 
taper is about thirty degrees.
