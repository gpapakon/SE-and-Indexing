<ABSTRACT>
A winch comprising a substantially cylindrical housing (1), 
rotatably disposed around a central shaft, which housing (1) 

comprises, at the top thereof, a flange (2) and has a central 
portion (1') of a diameter smaller than the diameter of the flange (2) 

and the diameter of the bottom housing portion, the central 
portion (1') of the housing (1) having a smooth surface and, in cross 

section, not being completely circular. To this end, the 
central portion (1') of the housing (1) is provided with a number of 

concave faces (6'), for instance six, extending in vertical 
direction over the central portion (1'), with the possible 

provision of flat faces (6) between these faces (6'). In the winch 
according to the invention, it is no longer necessary to 

roughen the surface of the central portion (1'), which considerably 
reduces the wear in the sheet to be wound onto the winch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a winch comprising a
substantially cylindrical housing, rotatably disposed around a
central shaft, which housing comprises, at the top thereof, a
flange and has a central portion of a diameter smaller than
the diameter of the flange and the diameter of the bottom
housing portion.Such a winch, constructed as a self-tailing winch, is
disclosed in Dutch patent application 8202193. In a self-tailing
winch, the flange becomes thinner toward the
circumference and a plate is mounted on the top side of the
flange, which plate also becomes thinner toward the
circumference and has a diameter equal to that of the flange.
Thus, between the flange and the plate a V-shaped groove is
present for receiving the line or sheet, directed to a
specific shape of the tooth-shaped raised portions which are
usually provided on the surfaces, facing each other, of the
flange and the plate and which are intended to hold a tight
fit on the line or sheet to be wound onto the winch in the V-shaped
groove. For this type of winch, as well as for winches
of the non-self-tailing type, it is conventional to roughen
the outer surface of the central portion of the housing so as
to prevent the line or sheet from slipping over the housing
surface. The roughness of the surface is in the order of
magnitude of 100-150 grains/cm2 and is obtained through a
jetting operation with a stainless-steel jetting means. Such
slipping of the line has a very adverse effect on the proper
functioning of the winch and consequently, experts regard the
rough surface of the central portion as strictly necessary. A
drawback of the roughened surface, however, is an extra wear
of the line portion which is wound around that surface and in
particular of the portion which, coming from the sail, first
contacts the rough surface. However, this wear has heretofore
been considered unavoidable. The object of the invention is to provide a winch of the
self-tailing type, enabling lines or sheets to be wound up in
an extremely reliable manner, while the wear of the line or
sheet due to its passing over the central portion of the
housing is nevertheless as little as possible.To this end, the invention provides a self-tailing winch
of the above-mentioned type, characterized as specified
in claim 1. Preferably, the faces are
evenly distributed over the circumference of the central
portion of the winch. Alternately flat and concave faces may
also be provided. The number of faces is for instance six,
eight or ten, but more or fewer faces are possible, as

<CLAIMS>
A winch comprising a substantially cylindrical
housing (1), rotatably disposed around a central shaft, said

housing comprising, at the top thereof, a flange (2) and
having a central portion (1') of a diameter smaller than the

diameter of the flange and smaller than the diameter of a
bottom housing portion, the central portion (1') of the

housing having an outer surface comprising a plurality of
hollow faces (6') extending over the central portion in

vertical direction,

   characterized in that these hollow faces (6'), viewed in
horizontal direction along the housing surface, are concave,

and that the transition between each face (6, 6') and an
adjoining housing surface or an adjoining face is flattened

and provides a non-abrupt, even transition.
A winch according to claim 1, characterized in that
between each pair of successive concave faces (6') a flat

face (6) is present.
A winch according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
between the successive faces (6, 6') cylindrical outer

surface portions of the housing (1) are present and that the
faces are evenly distributed over the outer surface of the

housing.
A winch according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the faces (6, 6') directly adjoin each other.
A winch according to any one of claims 1-4,

characterized in that the number of faces (6, 6') is eight.
A winch according to any one of claims 1-4,

characterized in that the number of faces (6, 6') is six.
A winch according to any one of claims 1-6,

characterized in that the faces (6, 6') extend in vertical 
direction at least over the entire central portion (1') of

the housing (1).
A housing evidently intended for a winch according to
any one of claims 1-7.
