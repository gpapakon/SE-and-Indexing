<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural container (10) or fruit bin made of plastic has four vertical walls (11-14), triangular corner columns (16-19) and a bottom (15) element. The exteriors of the vertical walls and bottom element have rectangular rib patterns (24, 35, 36). Openings in the vertical walls and bottom allow for atmospheric circulation. The upper edges of the sides are bowed inward slightly, and the bottom element has a slight inward dome when the bin is empty.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE: AGRICULTURAL CONTAINERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONGrowers and packers in the apple industry in the Pacific Northwest have standardized on wooden agricultural containers or bins since about 1957. In the orchard, apple pickers place freshly picked apples in the bins. The bins are taken to the packing house where they are sometimes emptied and the contents go through the regular packing process. Other times, the apples are sorted for size and grade and then the bins are refilled and placed in controlled atmosphere storage.The standard wooden bin has interior dimensions of 47" wide, 47" long and 28-1/2 inches in height. The wooden bins are fastened together with glue, nails, rivets and metal brackets.Wooden bins suffer from certain disadvantages, such as: a) Wood construction is subject to cracking and warpage. b) A single bin may absorb 12 pounds of water during the first three months of controlled atmosphere storage. This moisture comes from the fruit and its loss promotes fruit shrivel. c) Wood construction does not permit the recommended 8% to 11% free air space on the sides and bottom. This results in slower cooling of the bin contents, and increases difficulty in maintaining low temperatures during controlled atmosphere storage. d) Wood promotes contamination problems by absorbing chemicals used in orchard and packing house operations. e) Wood bins are often difficult and time consuming to repair. f) Most wooden bins lack a bin interlocking feature that would promote stability when the bins are stacked one on another. g) Wooden bins are not recyclable. h) Dry wooden bins create fire hazards in bin storage areas. The advantages of a plastic bin are: a) Plastic does not absorb moisture which assists in the control of humidity 

during storage and enhances fruit quality. b) With at least 10% free air space in the sides and bottom, the plastic bin allows faster cooling in storage, and assists in maintaining uniform low temperatures in the storage building. c) Smooth interior wall and floor surfaces permit easy cleaning and reduce the potential for contamination caused by decay organisms which often are present in wood bins. d) A molded interlocking feature permits safer storage and transport of vertically stacked bins. e) The plastic can be recycled into new bins.All of the above disadvantages of wooden bins and advantages of plastic bins are set forth in 'STUDIES ON APPLE BINS' by Dr. Alan F. Hauff, published by the Washington State Horticultural Association.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis

CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A plastic fruit bin comprising: four vertical walls forming, in plan view, a rectangular shape; a bottom element joined to the four vertical walls; and two support elements, each extending along and attached to the bottom of each of two opposite walls and partly supporting and extending below the bottom element. 2. The bin of claim 1 wherein the vertical walls are joined to each other at their ends by a triangular shaped column, each of said columns forming a comer of the bin, and said columns being stiffened internally with longitudinal ribs.
3. The bin of claim 2 wherein said triangular columns are open at the bottom end, each of said openings being closed with a cap, each cap having a vertical wall structure with an external circumferential rib.
4. The bin of claim 2 wherein the inside of the bin is smooth and the joints between the vertical walls, the triangular columns and the bottom element are rounded. 5. The bin of claim 1 wherein the exterior of the vertical walls and the lower side of the bottom element have a rectangular rib pattern formed thereon. 6. The bin of claim 5 wherein the planar spaces within the rib patterns of the vertical walls and the bottom element are provided with openings for atmospheric circulation. 7. The bin of claim 5 wherein a plurality of rubber plugs is inserted into spaces in the rib pattern on the lower side of the bottom element.
8. The bin of claim 1 wherein the upper portions of the vertical walls are bowed slightly inward, and the center of the bottom element is bowed slightly upward. 9. The bin of claim 2 wherein recesses are formed at the lower end of each comer column, and matching projections are formed at the upper end of 


each corner column.
10. A clear plastic packing ticket holder comprising; a flat plate having indentations for finger gripping; a flange on either side of the flat plate; and the distance between flange edges being such as to provide firm contact with any adjacent vertical ribs of the bin of claim 1.
11. A plastic fruit bin comprising: four vertical walls forming, in plan view, a rectangular shape; a bottom element joined to the four vertical walls; two support elements, each extending along and attached to the bottom of each of two opposite walls and partly supporting and extending below the bottom element; and an array of gas injection tubes disposed on the lower side of the bottom element and extending up the center of each of the four vertical walls. 12. The bin of claim 11 wherein the vertical walls are joined to each other at their ends by a triangular shaped column, each of said columns forming a corner of the bin, and said columns being stiffened internally with longitudinal ribs..
13. The bin of claim 12 wherein the inside of the bin is smooth and the joints between the walls, the triangular columns and the bottom element are rounded.
14. The bin of claim 11 wherein the exterior of the vertical walls and the lower side of the bottom element have a rectangular rib pattern formed thereon.
15. The bin of claim 13 wherein the planar spaces within the rib patterns of the vertical walls and the bottom element are provided with openings for atmospheric circulation.
16. The bin of claim 14 wherein a plurality of rubber plugs is inserted into spaces in the rib pattern on the lower side of the bottom element.
17. The bin of claim 11 wherein the upper portions of the vertical walls are bowed slightly inward, and the center of the bottom element is bowed slightly upward. 


 18. The bin of claim 12 wherein recesses are formed at the lower end of each corner column, and matching projections are formed at the upper end of each corner column.
