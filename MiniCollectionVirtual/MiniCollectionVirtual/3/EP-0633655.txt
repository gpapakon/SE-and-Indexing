<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for effecting single sideband suppressed carrier 
modulation suitable for small, hand-held, high-frequency cellular radio transmitters 

such as those used at 900 mHz are disclosed. A local oscillator (0.8 RF) generates a 
signal at 0.8 the frequency of the desired carrier. The generated frequency is counted 

down (in DB4) to produce an IF that is 0.2 the frequency of the desired carrier, and 
the IF is mixed (in MX6, MX7) with the baseband signal to produce a modulated IF 

(at output of S). The modulated IF is then mixed (in MX8) with the first generated 
signal (0.8 RF) to generate the modulated carrier signal (RF). Advantageously, all of 

the foregoing components can be provided on the same integrated circuit chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to modulation techniques 
and, more particularly, to single sideband suppressed 
carrier modulation suitable for small, hand-held, high-frequency 
cellular radio transmitters. A radio frequency carrier may be generated by 
using a local oscillator operating at the carrier frequency 
or by using two local oscillators and a mixer to generate 
the desired carrier frequency as the sum of the two local 
oscillator frequencies. The first scheme is sometimes 
referred to as "direct" up-conversion while the latter 
scheme is sometimes referred to as "double" up-conversion. 
In double up-conversion one of the local oscillators 
generates an intermediate frequency (IF) and the other local 
oscillator generates a frequency which is that of the radio 
frequency (RF) carrier minus the IF frequency. The mixer 
generates both sum and difference frequencies. The unwanted 
frequency, usually the difference frequency, is filtered 
out. In either of the conversion arrangements, single 
sideband suppressed carrier operation requires that the 
baseband signal be derived from balanced amplifers and 
applied to two mixers in phase quadrature so that the 
carrier may be suppressed. After modulation, the desired RF 
sideband signal is power amplified and transmitted from an 
antenna. Unwanted sidebands are attenuated by suitable 
filters. Because the RF power is large compared to the 
power of the local oscillator, a small fraction of the 
signal from the antenna fed back to the local oscillator may 
have sufficient strength to cause the local oscillator to 
malfunction. In hand-held radios at 900 mHz, for example, 
sufficient shielding is almost impossible to achieve.  
 
Moreover, single sideband suppressed carrier systems dictate 
that the carrier frequency power level be at least 30 Db 
down from the power level of the desired sideband. Any 
leakage of the local oscillator to the output of the 
modulator package must therefore be controlled. Such 
leakage may be troublesome if, when the output power is 
desired to be attenuated, the leakage power remains 
constant. In addition, a quadrature coding scheme requires 
that 90 degree phase-shifted signals be accurately 
generated. R-C networks for achieving an accurate 90 degree 
phase shift are difficult to achieve with the usual 
production run accuracy available in integrated circuits. 
Accordingly, such R-C networks must be fabricated as off-chip 
devices so that component tolerances can more 
accurately be controlled. It would be desirable to provide
