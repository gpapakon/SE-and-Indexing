<ABSTRACT>
A floor cleaning machine is provided, comprising a motor-driven or 
operator-pushed movable body carrying one or more rotatable scrubbers, 

reservoirs for storing fresh and spent cleaning liquid, a means for 
dosing fresh cleaning liquid on to the floor and a vacuum pick-up system 

comprising a suction head including a squeegee. The machine is provided 
with a lifting arrangement (1) attached to the bottom side thereof and 

comprising a housing (2) and one or more wheels (3), whereby the housing 
includes means which can cooperate with said wheels such that the 

squeegee or scrubbers are automatically raised respectively lowered when 
the machine is moved in a rearward respectively forward direction. 

Furthermore, said lifting arrangement is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automatic floor-treating 
and -cleaning machines. More particularly, the invention 
relates to such machines which are used for the cleaning 
of carpets or hard surfaces of floor areas, such as in 
hotels, factories, office buildings, shopping centres and 
the like. In general, such automatic floor-treating and -cleaning 
machines comprise an operator-pushed or motor-driven 
movable body carrying one or more motor-driven rotatable 
scrubbers, reservoirs for storing fresh and spent cleaning 
liquid, a means for dosing fresh cleaning liquid on to the 
floor and a squeegee/vacuum pick-up system for recovering 
spent liquid from the floor. The operation of said vacuum 
pick-up system is usually as follows. During the cleaning 
operation spent liquid is recovered using a squeegee which 
is connected to the spent liquid reservoir by way of a 
suction head. The suction operation is effectuated by an 
under-pressure in the spent liquid reservoir and the 
squeegee, the under-pressure being generated by a vacuum 
motor. It has been recognised in the past that the squeegee may 
be damaged if it is not raised or lifted when the machine 
is moved in a rearward direction. As a consequence, 
several types of lifting arrangements have been disclosed. 
For instance, US-A-4,334,335 relates to a floor scrubbing 
machine having a squeegee which can be hydraulically 
raised and lowered. This machine is provided with a flow 
sensing device which recognizes the flow direction of the 
hydraulic fluid needed for driving the wheels of the 
machine and which automatically lifts the squeegee when  
 
the wheels are driven in reverse.
 
Another type of floor scrubbing machine including a 
mechanism for raising the squeegee assembly when the 
scrubber is moved rearwardly, is disclosed by US-A-4,619,010. 
The device described in this document is a 
walk-behind scrubbing machine including a hand-operated 
handle for moving the machine. When this handle is pushed, 
it also operates a switch which activates an electric 
drive for moving a lever or rack such that the squeegee 
assembly is lowered. When the handle is pulled, the 
mechanism including the switch is operated to raise the 
squeegee assembly.
 
Yet another type of floor treating machine with a lift-off 
mechanism is disclosed by US-A-3,983,592. This document 
describes a rug shampooing machine including means for 
producing dry foam, a rotatable brush for working such 
foam into a carpet, and a vacuum nozzle/squeegee assembly 
for picking up

<CLAIMS>
Floor cleaning machine, comprising a motor-driven or 
operator-pushed movable body carrying one or more 

rotatable scrubbers, reservoirs for storing fresh and 
spent cleaning liquid, a means for dosing fresh cleaning 

liquid on to the floor and a vacuum pick-up system 
comprising a suction head including a squeegee, characterised 

in that the machine is provided with a lifting 
arrangement attached to the bottom side thereof and 

comprising a housing and one or more wheels, whereby the 
housing includes means which can cooperate with said 

wheels such that the squeegee or scrubbers are 
automatically raised respectively lowered when the machine 

is moved in a rearward respectively forward direction. 
Floor cleaning machine according to claim 1, wherein 
the lifting arrangement is tightly fixed to the suction 

head so as to enable the squeegee to be automatically 
raised or lowered. 
Floor cleaning machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the means which can cooperate with the wheels 

include one or more openings for an axis of the wheels to 
be movably attached therewith and wherein the dimensions 

of said openings are larger than the diameter of the axis. 
Floor cleaning machine according to any of claims 1-3, 
wherein said means comprise one or more projections which 

can cooperate with the wheels for lifting the squeegee 
when the machine is moved in a rearward direction. 
Floor cleaning machine according to any of claims 1-4, 
wherein said means include one or more turnable rolls 

which cooperate with the wheels as long as the machine is 
moved rearwardly. 
Floor cleaning machine according to any of claims 1-5, 
wherein the axis is provided with two wheels. 
Lifting arrangement suitable for use in the floor 
cleaning machine according to any of claims 1-6, 

characterised in that the arrangement comprises a housing 
and one or more wheels, whereby the housing includes means 

which cooperate with said wheels such that the squeegee or 
scrubbers of the floor cleaning machine are automatically 

raised respectively lowered when the structure is attached 
to the bottom side of the machine and said machine is 

moved in a rearward respectively forward direction.
