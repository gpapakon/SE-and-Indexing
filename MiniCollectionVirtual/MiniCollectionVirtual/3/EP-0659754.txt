<ABSTRACT>
By reacting a chloromonosilane or 
chlorodisilane with a halogenated hydrocarbon in 

a liquid phase in the presence of metallic 
aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a hydrocarbon 

group is substituted for at least one chlorine 
atom of the chlorosilane for introducing 

hydrocarbon into the chlorosilane. Silanes 
having a high degree of hydrocarbon substitution 

can be easily synthesized from chlorosilanes 
under moderate conditions and with high 

volumetric efficiency. The reagents used are 
aluminum or aluminum alloys and halogenated 

hydrocarbons which are inexpensive and readily 
available.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification discloses methods for introducing
hydrocarbons into chlorosilanes.Chlorosilanes having a high degree of
alkyl substitution and derivatives thereof have
found a wide variety of applications in the
industry. For example, trimethylchlorosilane is
not only widely used as a silylating agent, but
also effective for rendering inorganic
substances hydrophobic and introducing terminal
block units into organopolysiloxane chains. t-butyldimethylchlorosilane
is also widely used as
a silylating agent, especially for the synthesis of
intermediates of medicine. Hexamethyldisilane
is also useful as a silylating agent of
medicines and other products. Since a distillation kettle for producing
silanes contains methylchlorodisilanes having a
high degree of chlorine substitution, it is of
industrial significance to methylate the
methylchlorodisilanes for converting into
disilanes having a high degree of methyl
substitution.For alkylating chloromonosilanes, Grignard
reagents are conventionally used. This method
has the disadvantages that metallic magnesium is
expensive and a large volume of solvent must be
used, detracting from volumetric efficiency. In
Z. Anorg. Allgem. Chem., 287273 (1956), an
attempt was made to methylate chlorosilanes
using methylaluminum - sesquichloride. It is
known that one of the reagents, methylaluminum-sesquichloride
is spontaneously ignitable in air
and undergoes explosive hydrolysis in the co-presence
of a trace amount of water. This
would be dangerous for commercial synthesis.JP-A-256688/1990 discloses a method for
methylating a chlorosilane by effecting gas
phase reaction between a chlorosilane and methyl
chloride gas in the presence of Al in a reactor tube at 180 to 450°C.EP-A-405 780 discloses a similar gas phase reaction
carried out at above 200°C, followed by a redistribution
reaction using metal halide catalyst. 
This method is dangerous in that the
reaction requires a high temperature and
aluminum chloride as a by-product tends to clog
the reactor tube.Also known in the art are alkylation of
chlorosilanes using alkyllithium and alkylsodium
(see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 68, 1675 (1946)) and
alkylation of chlorosilanes using alkylzinc (see
Ann., 222, 354 (1884)). These methods are not
commercially acceptable since they are inferior
in safety and operation efficiency and
particularly the latter method is low in yield.As mentioned above, the prior art methods
for preparing monosilanes having a high degree
of alkyl substitution suffer from problems
including the use of expensive
