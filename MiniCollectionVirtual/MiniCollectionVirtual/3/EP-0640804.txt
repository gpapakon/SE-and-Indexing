<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger is provided with a first tank (111) and a 
second tank (112). Heat transfer 

tubes (15) are disposed between the tanks and are connected to the 
tanks to place the tanks in 

fluid communication. Either of the tanks may be divided into chambers by a partition. The 
partition has at least one portion which is oriented to be angularly offset from the direction 

of an air flow passing through the heat exchanger. The orientation of the partition permits 
the heat transfer tubes to be connected to the tanks in an arrangement so that no portion 

of the air flow can pass through the heat exchanger without striking at least one of the heat 
transfer tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat exchanger and, more particularly, to an arrangement 
for heat transfer tubes in the heat exchanger. A typical arrangement for closely packed heat transfer tubes in a heat exchanger is 
shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,235,281 issued to Fitch et al.. Referring to Figs. 
1-3, another heat exchanger 10 comprises an upper tank 11, a lower tank 12, and a heat exchanger 
core 13 disposed between upper tank 11 and lower tank 12. Heat exchanger core 13 
comprises a plurality of heat transfer tubes 15 spaced apart from each other and 
substantially parallel to one another. Upper tank 11 is divided into three chambers, such 
as first upper chamber 18, second upper chamber 19, and third upper chamber 20, by a first 
upper partition 11a and a second upper partition 11b. First upper partition 11a is 
perpendicular to a direction of air flow Q through heat exchanger core 13. Second upper 
partition 11b is parallel to air flow Q. First upper chamber 19 has the same capacity as 
third upper chamber 20. Lower tank 12 is divided into two chambers, such first lower chamber 21 and second 
lower chamber 22 by lower partition 12a. First upper chamber 18 and third upper chamber 
20 are respectively provided with inlet 16 and outlet 17 which connect heat exchanger 10  
 
to an air conditioning system (not shown), i.e. a vehicle air conditioning system. Each of 
the plurality of heat transfer tubes 15 is joined at its opposite ends to upper tank 11 and 
lower tank 12. A heat exchanger medium, a refrigerant for example, is introduced through inlet 16 
into first upper chamber 18. The medium flows down through tubes 15 to first lower 
chamber 21 of lower tank 12. The medium then flows back up tubes 15 to second upper 
chamber 19. The medium then flows down tubes 15 to second lower chamber 22 and back 
up through tubes 15 to third upper chamber 20. The medium then exits the heat exchanger 
through outlet 17. Generally, heat transfer tubes 15 are designed to be closely arranged so that the air 
flow Q, which passes across tubes 15, will strike each of the plurality of tubes 15. 
Generally, heat transfer tubes 15 cannot be connected to upper and lower tanks 11, 12 in 
the areas of partition portions 11a, 11b, and 12a. Therefore, tubes 15 are generally not 
disposed between tanks 11 and 12 in these areas. This absence of tubes creates a first 
pathway A along lower partition 12a and extending between upper and lower tanks 11, 12. 
A second pathway B is also created along partition 11a and

A heat exchanger exposed to an air flow which flows in a direction, said heat 
exchanger comprising: 


a first tank (111) having a first front face (111c); 
a second tank (112) having a second front face (112c) spaced apart from said first tank;
 
said first and second front faces (111c, 112c) being 

arranged substantially perpendicular to a direction of air flow (Q); 
a plurality of heat transfer tubes (15) disposed between said first and second tanks, 
each of said plurality of heat transfer tubes (15) connected at one end to said first tank (111) and at 

the other end to said second tank (112); and 
a partition (113, 213, 313, 114) disposed within said first tank (111) to divide said first tank (111) into at least 
two chambers, characterised in that 
said partition (113, 213, 313, 114) has at least one portion which is angularly offset from 
the direction of the air flow, and wherein 

said partition (113, 213, 313, 114) permits 
said plurality of heat transfer tubes (15) to be connected to said first and second tanks in 

an arrangement so that no portion of the air flow (Q) can pass through the heat 
exchanger without striking at least one of said plurality of heat transfer tubes (15). 
The heat exchanger of claim 1 wherein said at least one portion (114c, 113b) 
of said partition (113, 114) is perpendicular to the direction of the air flow (Q). 
The heat exchanger of claim 1 wherein said 
partition (313) is integrally oblique to the direction of the air flow (Q). 
The heat exchanger of one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said 
partition (313) is formed to be wave-shaped and extends from a first end portion of said 

heat exchanger to a second end portion of said heat exchanger, generally in the direction 
of the air flow (Q). 
The heat exchanger of claim 4, said wave-shaped 
partition (313) having successively opposed cavities, wherein one of said plurality of heat transfer 

tubes (15) is connected to said first (111) and second (112) tanks at each successively opposed cavity of said 
wave-shaped partition.
