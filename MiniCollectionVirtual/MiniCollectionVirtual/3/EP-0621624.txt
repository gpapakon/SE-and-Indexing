<ABSTRACT>
A colour display device, with an electron beam source and with an 
arrangement of pixels defined by either blue or green or red-luminescing material, and 

including means for exciting the pixels, the exciting means being operable for scanning 
the pixel arrangement with excitation pulses under line at a time scanning conditions. 

The luminance of such a colour display device is enhanced at a given radiation power 

and the linearity of the luminance is improved in dependence upon the electron energy 
density by using luminescent materials at least two of which have a luminescence decay 

time shorter than the excitation pulse time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a colour display device, with an electron beam
source and with an arrangement of pixels defined by either blue or green or red-luminescing
material, and including means for exciting the pixels, the exciting means
being operable for scanning the pixel arrangement with excitation pulses under line at
time scanning conditions.A colour display device of this type is described in DE-OS 41 12 078.In such flat-panel colour display devices, only low anode voltages of
approximately 1 to 10 kV are available for generating light. Consequently, the electrons
penetrate the luminescent materials less deeply than in the conventional display devices
of the cathode ray tube types. The achievable luminance is relatively small. The
linearity of the luminance in dependence upon the excitation energy density deteriorates
with a decreasing anode voltage.It is an object of the invention to enhance the luminance of a colour
display device of the type described in the opening paragraph at a given radiation power
and to improve the linearity of the luminance in dependence upon the electron energy
density.This object is achieved in that at least two of the luminescent materials
luminescing in the colours blue, green and red have a luminescence decay time shorter
than the excitation pulse lengths.A characteristic feature of colour display devices of the type described in
the opening paragraph is that due to the specific scanning method, the excitation period
of a red, green or blue-luminescing pixel is considerably extended as compared with
conventional cathode ray tubes. In colour display devices according to the invention a
multitude of pixels is excited simultaneously during the overall excitation period, for
example during a line period. The excitation period of a pixel covers, for example one
line period (64 µs for PAL), or a period (spot dwell time) in the range of from 10 to 60
µsec for plasma panel type displays and field emission type displays, whereas a pixel in
a cathode ray tube is excited for several hundred ns only. The invention is based on the recognition that for the display devices
under consideration the maximum luminance at a satisfactory linearity can be achieved
with those luminescent materials which have a sufficiently short decay time of the
luminescence. Then the excitation energy is converted into luminescence light with a
satisfactory efficiency and at a high energy density.The decay time in the sense of the present invention is understood to
mean the time in which the intensity
