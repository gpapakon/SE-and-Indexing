<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bis-aryl carbinol 
derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using such 
derivatives. International Publication Number WO 89/10369 discloses 
compounds of the formula: 
 
wherein: one of a, b, c and d represents nitrogen or -NR11-, wherein R11 
is, amongst others, O-, and the remaining a, b, c and d groups are CH; T  
 
represents carbon or nitrogen, with the dotted line attached to T 
representing an optional double bond when T is carbon; when m plus n 
equals 1 or 2, X represents, amongst others, -O- or -S(O)e- wherein e is 
0, 1 or 2; when m plus n represents 0, X can be, amongst others, any 
substituent for m plus n equalling 1, a direct bond or propenylene; when 
m plus n equals 3 then X equals a direct bond; each Ra may be, 
amongst others, H; Z represents =O or =S such that when Z is O, R may 
be, amongst others, 
 
wherein Y is N or NR11 ; when Z represents =S, R represents in addition 
to the R group above, aryloxy or alkoxy. WO 89/10369 generically discloses compounds which can 
have the structure: 
 
wherein Z can be O and R can be:  
 
 
wherein Y can be NR11 and R11 can be -O-; however, no specific 
compounds are disclosed with this structure. U.S. 4,826,853 issued to Piwinski et al. on May 2, 1989 is 
the priority document for WO 88/03138 which published on May 5, 1988. 
WO 88/03138 discloses compounds of the formula 
 
wherein: one of a, b, c and d represents N or NR9 where R9 is, amongst 
others, O, and the remaining a, b, c and d groups are CH; X represents 
N or C, which C may contain an optional double bond to carbon atom 
11; Z represents O, S or H2 such that when Z is O, R may be, amongst 
others, 
  
 
when Z represents S, R represents in addition to the R group above, 
aryloxy or alkoxy; and when Z represents H2, R can be, amongst others, 
 
These compounds are disclosed as being useful in the treatment of 
allergy and inflammation. In particular, WO88/03138 discloses intermediates having 
the formulas: 
 
and  
 
During the course of research on the compounds disclosed 
in WO 88/03138, it was generally found that the compounds having a 
carbonyl group (Z = O) attached to the piperidyl, piperidylidenyl or 
piperazinyl nitrogen atom were much stronger antagonists of platelet 
activating factor (PAF) than the compounds having a CH2 group (Z = H2) 
attached thereto. WO 90/13548 published on November 15, 1990 on 
PCT/US90/02251 which was filed on April 30 , 1990 and claims priority 
to U.S. Application Serial No. 345,604 filed May 1, 1989
