<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dye-donor elements 
for use according to thermal dye sublimation transfer and to novel 
dyes for use in said dye-donor elements. Thermal dye sublimation transfer is a recording method in which 
a dye-donor element provided with a dye layer containing sublimable 
dyes having heat transferability is brought into contact with a 
receiver sheet or receiver element and selectively, in accordance 
with a pattern information signal, is heated by means of a thermal 
printing head provided with a plurality of juxtaposed 
heat-generating resistors, whereby dye is transferred from the 
selectively heated regions of the dye-donor element to the receiver 
sheet and forms a pattern thereon, the shape and density of which 
are in accordance with the pattern and intensity of heat applied to 
the dye-donor element. A dye-donor element for use according to thermal dye sublimation 
transfer usually comprises a very thin support e.g. a polyester 
support, one side of which is covered with a dye layer comprising 
the printing dyes. Usually, an adhesive or subbing layer is 
provided between the support and the dye layer. Normally, the 
opposite side is covered with a slipping layer that provides a 
lubricated surface against which the thermal printing head can pass 
without suffering abrasion. An adhesive layer may be provided 
between the support and the slipping layer. The dye layer can be a monochromic dye layer or it may comprise 
sequential repeating areas of differently coloured dyes e.g. dyes 
having a cyan, magenta, yellow, and optionally black hue. When a 
dye-donor element containing three or more primary colour dyes is 
used, a multicolour image can be obtained by sequentially performing 
the dye transfer process steps for each colour. A primary coloured dye layer e.g. a magenta or cyan or yellow 
dye layer may comprise only one primary coloured dye (a magenta, 
cyan or yellow dye respectively) or may comprise a mixture of two or  
 
more primary color dyes of the same hue (two magenta, two cyan or 
two yellow dyes respectively). Any dye can be used in such a dye layer provided it is easily 
transferable to the dye-image-receiving layer of the receiver sheet 
or element by the action of heat. Typical and specific examples of dyes for use in thermal dye 
sublimation transfer have been described in e.g. EP 209,990, EP 
209,991, EP 216,483, EP 218,397, EP 227,095, EP 227,096, EP 229,374,
