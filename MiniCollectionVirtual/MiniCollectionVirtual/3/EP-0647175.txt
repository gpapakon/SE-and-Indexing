<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention the linear displacement of the injection screw (10) in injection molding machines with an electric drive (1) is controlled. The set position or speed of the servomotor (1) is controlled or regulated according to predetermined prescriptions. Instead of the state-of-the-art torque regulation, a sufficient torque reserve is ensured. All low-frequency vibrations of the system caused by the elastic behaviour of the liquid plastic mass are completely eliminated and the injection parameters are mastered to a much greater extent, so that parts having extremely thin walls may be highly accurately produced. The setting signal is not linearly calculated but preferably as a root-like function of the deviation between real and set values. A new type of multiple drive for at least two, in particular three or more axles is disclosed with a corresponding number of drive controllers, a data transmission system and a computer. The process is defined in the computer and corresponding set values are predetermined. Said set values are transmitted by the data transmission system to a prescription storage of an intelligent drive which controls and/or regulates several axles in a coordinated manner.
