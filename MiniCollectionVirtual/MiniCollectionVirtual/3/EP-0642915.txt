<ABSTRACT>
Two (or more) tubes (10a, 10b) are formed in 
side-by-side relation joined together at a juncture 

(10c) including a plurality of performed members (6) 
bonded to and within the juncture (10c) at spaced 

locations along the longitudinal axes of the preformed 
members and of the juncture. Each of the preformed 

members (6) includes a pair of flow-reducing, groove 
formations (44, 46) one on each side of the longitudinal 

axis (42) of the preformed member (6). The juncture 
(10c) is slit along the longitudinal axes (42) of the 

preformed members (6) to thereby form two (or more) drip 
irrigation lines DIL₁, DIL₂) each integrally formed with 

a section of the plurality of preformed members (6), 
each section having one of the groove formations (44, 

46) serving as a flow-reducer element in the respective 
line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for making drip irrigation lines, and also to a 
preformed member useful in such method. Drip irrigation lines generally include a 
continuous tube having a plurality of openings therethrough 
along spaced intervals of the tube, and a plurality of flow-reducer 
elements bonded to one face of the tube in 
communication with the openings so as to reduce the flow of 
the outletted irrigation water to drops or trickles. Such 
drip irrigation lines are gaining widespread use because of 
their many advantages, including efficiency in the delivery 
of the irrigating water directly to the plant roots, and 
substantial savings in the required irrigation water and/or 
additives thereto. Such drip irrigation lines are generally produced 
at the present time by extruding the plastic tube, bonding 
the flow-reducer elements to the extruded tube at 
longitudinally-spaced intervals, and then forming the outlet 
openings through the tube at longitudinally-spaced intervals 
aligned with the outlet ends of the flow-reducer elements. 
US Patents 3,981,452, 5,022,940, 5,271,786 and 5,282,916 
illustrate examples of such known extrusion processes. 
Extrusion apparatus, however, is very expensive, and the 
initial cost of such apparatus therefore constitutes a 
substantial item of cost in manufacturing such drip 
irrigation lines. This is particularly true in the 
production of inexpensive thin-wall lines since both the 
initial cost, and the maximum rate of extrusion, of such 
apparatus are substantially the same whether thick-wall or 
thin-wall tubes are being extruded. In addition, high 
precision is required in forming the outlet openings in the 
tube, since any misalignment of the outlet opening with 
respect to the outlet end of the flow-reducer elements  
 
incorporated in the tube, will deleteriously affect the 
operation of the drip irrigation line. An object of present invention is to provide a 
method, and also apparatus, for making drip irrigation lines 
having advantages in one or both of the above repects. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of making drip irrigation lines 
comprising: forming at least two tubes in side-by-side 
relation joined together at a juncture including a plurality 
of preformed members bonded to and within the juncture at 
spaced locations along the longitudinal axes of the 
preformed members and of the juncture; each of the preformed 
members being preformed with a pair of flow-reducing, groove 
formati

A method of making drip irrigation lines, 
comprising: forming at least two tubes in side-by-side 

relation joined together at a juncture including a plurality 
of preformed members bonded to and within said juncture at 

spaced locations along the longitudinal axes of the 
preformed members and of said juncture; each of said 

preformed members being preformed with a pair of flow-reducing, 
groove formations, one on each side of the 

longitudinal axis of the preformed member; and slitting said 
juncture and said preformed members along their longitudinal 

axes, to thereby form at least two drip irrigation lines 
each integrally formed with a section of said plurality of 

preformed members, each section having one of said groove 
formations serving as a flow-reducer element in the 

respective line. 
The method according to Claim 1, wherein each 
of said preformed members is preformed with inlet recess 

means and with outlet recess means both located and 
configured such that when said juncture and preformed 

members are slit along their longitudinal axes, said inlet 
recess means serves as an inlet to each of the flow-reducer 

elements of the respective line, and said outlet recess 
means serves as an outlet from the respective flow-reducer 

element of the respective line. 
The method according to Claim 2, wherein said 
inlet recess means are in the form of a pair of edge 

recesses opening at opposite sides of the preformed member, 
and said outlet recess means are in the form of a common 

internal recess traversing across said longitudinal axis of 
the preformed member so as to be slit at the time said 

juncture and preformed members are slit. 
The method according to Claim 3, wherein said 
pair of flow-reducing groove formations, one on each side 

of the longitudinal axis of the preformed member, are 
labyrinths which communicate at one of their ends with one 

of said pair of edge recesses, and at their opposite ends 

 
with said common recess. 
The method according to any one of Claims 1-4, 
wherein said preformed member is a continuous strip 

preformed with said pairs of flow-reducing groove formations 
at spaced locations along its longitudinal axis. 
The method according to any one of Claims 1-4, 
wherein there are a plurality of said preformed members 

bonded to a continuous strip at spaced locations along the 
length of the continuous strip. 
The method according to any one of Claims 1-4, 
wherein there are a plurality of said preformed members each 

individually bonded to said juncture at spaced locations 
along the longitudinal axis thereof. 
The method according to any one of Claims 1-6, 
wherein said tubes and said juncture are formed by 

extrusion, said preformed members being bonded within said 
juncture at the time of extrusion thereof. 
The method according to any one of Claims 1-6, 
wherein said tubes and said juncture are formed by seaming 

sheet material, said preformed members being bonded within 
the juncture at the time of seaming thereof. 
The method according to any one of Claims 1-9, 
wherein three or more tubes are formed and include a 

juncture between each pair of adjacent tubes, and a 
plurality of said preformed members bonded to and with each 

of said junctures.
