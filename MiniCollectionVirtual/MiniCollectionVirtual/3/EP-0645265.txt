<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suspension of a vehicle such as 
an automobile, and more particularly, to a hydraulic active suspension according to the 
preamble portion of claim 1, which is 
adapted to operate with a compensation for lateral and/or longitudinal forces due to braking, 
acceleration and/or turning of the vehicle according to a separate term 
of calculation. A hydraulic active suspension of a vehicle such as an 
automobile is known from for example, Japanese 
Patent Laid-open Publication 2-175405. This hydraulic active suspension 
comprises actuators each having a working fluid chamber and provided 
for a corresponding vehicle wheel to increase or decrease a suspension 
force of the corresponding vehicle wheel according to the increase or the 
decrease of a pressure in the working fluid chamber, pressure 
adjusting means for adjusting the pressure in each of the working 
fluid chambers, vehicle height detection means for detecting the vehicle 
height of a portion of the vehicle body corresponding to each of the 
vehicle wheels, an acceleration detection means for detecting the 
acceleration of the vehicle body, feedback control amount calculation 
means for calculating feedback control amounts based upon the vehicle 
heights, feed forward control amount calculation means for calculating 
feed forward control amounts based upon the acceleration of the 
vehicle body so as to suppress changes of the posture of the vehicle 
body due to inertial disturbances to zero, and control means for 
controlling the pressure adjusting means based upon the feedback 
control amounts and the feed forward control amounts. In such an active suspension, the pressure adjusting means, and 
therefore the pressure in the working fluid chamber of each of the 
actuators, is controlled according to both of the feedback control 
amount based upon the vehicle height of the corresponding portion of 
the vehicle body and the feed forward control amount based upon the 
acceleration of the vehicle body, whereby a good riding comfortability 
of the vehicle can be ensured together with an effective prevention of  
 
changes of the posture of the vehicle body due to inertial disturbances 
applied thereto during acceleration, deceleration or turning of the 
vehicle. However, in the above-mentioned prior art active suspension, a 
vertical link reaction force of the suspension due to a longitudinal 
force acting on the vehicle wheel during braking or acceleration of the 
vehicle or a lateral force acting on the vehicle wheel
