<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connecting distribution block having plug parts (3, 4, 5) (which are connected to one another and are arranged in the housing (6) having contact part receptacles in planes lying one above the other) for operation of a large number of branching cables (having a small number of poles) from a feed point (1a) having a greater number of poles, the lowest plane being constructed as a plug having a higher number of poles, and the planes lying above it in each case having only contact receptacles corresponding to the number of poles of the cables branching off.

Electrical connecting distribution block having contact part seats disposed one above
another in a housing (6) with interconnected plug parts disposed in planes for operating a

large number of branching-off low-pole lines from a higher-pole feed-in point, characterised
in that the lowest plane is formed as a higher-pole plug (1) and the planes (3,4,5) lying

above respectively have only contact seats according to the pole number of the branching-off
lines.
Electrical connecting distribution block having contact part seats disposed one above
another in a housing (6) with interconnected plug parts disposed in planes for operating a

large number of branching-off low-pole lines from a higher-pole feed-in point, characterised
in that the lowest plane is formed as a higher-pole plug (1a) and in that thereabove a

plurality of output plug planes (3', 4', 5') which are parallel one below another and which are
perpendicular to the lower input plane are provided, each of the output plug planes

respectively having only contact seats according to the pole number of the branching-off
lines.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that at
least in some planes output plugs wired through in parallel are provided for every two

branching-off lines.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the lower input plane is five-poled and those above are three-poled.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to claim 4, characterised in that the lower
input plane has on the one side a 5-pole input plug part (1a) and on the opposite side a 5-pole

output plug part (1b), which is connected through electrically therewith.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that three
branching-off plug planes (L1, L2, L3) are provided. 
Electrical connecting distribution block according to one claims 1 to 6, characterised by a
narrow distribution box (6) containing the transverse connections between the input and the

output planes, on whose two end walls preferably coded contact protection sleeves are
integrally formed for the plug parts.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to claim 7, characterised in that each plug
plane is allocated locking hooks which engage resiliently in the counter-plug housing to he

connected on.
Electrical connecting distribution, block according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that on
the lower narrow side and/or side face of the distribution box (6) a fixing device for a plane

assembly support is integrally formed.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to claim 9, characterised in that the
fixing device takes the form of screw-on eyelets, catch hooks or the like.
Electrical connecting distribution block according to one of claims 7 to 10, characterised in
that on the distribution box (6), receiving shafts (10) are formed for the optional provision

of locking hooks formed as attaching components.
