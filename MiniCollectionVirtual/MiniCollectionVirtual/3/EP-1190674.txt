<ABSTRACT>
The lancet system (1), to take blood samples, has a drive mechanism (6) to move the lancet needle (2) from its rest position into the penetration setting to take blood. The extended needle is retracted (7) by the system into the rest position. The lancet, to take blood samples, has a section which can be gripped by the retractor, at the end away from the lancet needle point (5). The retraction unit has a spring (8) action, in the magazine for the lancets. An Independent claim is included for a lancet magazine, which can have a system to move the lancets from a ready position into the working position to take blood.

System for storing and providing lancets for collecting body fluids comprising

i) a plurality of essentially needle-shaped lancets (1);
ii) a drive unit which has a drive element (6) which, in order to carry out a lancing process, is moved from a resting position into a lancing position;
iii) a storage area to store the lancets (1);
iv) a withdrawal area to guide at least the tip (5) of a lancet (1) out of the system during the lancing process and
v) a transport unit (18) which can transport lancets (1) from the storage area into the withdrawal area,

wherein the drive element (6) is arranged in such a manner that in the withdrawal area it acts on the lancet (1) located there to carry out a lancing process and thus moves the lancet from a resting position into a lancing position and wherein the system has a retraction device (7) in the withdrawal area which interacts with the lancet (1) which is located in the withdrawal area, while the lancet (1) is moved from the lancing position into its resting position in order to carry out the lancing process, wherein the drive unit and the retraction device (7) act independently of one another on the lancet (1) 
characterized in that
 the lancet (1) is returned by a central retraction device (7) such that different lancets are returned by only one retraction device.
System according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the end of the lancet opposite to the tip has an element that can be gripped by a retraction device.
System according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the return device contains a spring mechanism.
System according to one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that
 the lancets are stored in a magazine.
System according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the magazine contains the retraction device.
Lancet magazine (10) for storing lancets (1) comprising

i) a plurality of essentially needle-shaped lancets (1),
ii) a storage area for storing the lancets (1), and
iii) a withdrawal area for driving at least the tip (5) of a lancet out of the magazine (10) during the lancing process, which can be driven out by means of a drive unit;

wherein the magazine (10) has a central retraction device (7) in the withdrawal area which interacts with the lancet (1) located in the withdrawal area in such a manner that the retraction device (7) acts on the lancet (1) independently of a drive unit in order to move the lancet (1) from the lancing position into its resting position after the lancing process has been carried out, 
characterized in that
 different lancets are returned only by one retraction device.
Lancet magazine according to claim 6, additionally containing

iv) a transport unit which can transport lancets from the storage area into the withdrawal area.
Lancet magazine according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the end of the lancet opposite to the tip has an element that can be gripped by the retraction device.
Lancet magazine according to claim 6, 7 or 8, 
characterized in that
 the retraction device contains a spring mechanism.
Lancing device suitable for use in a system for storing and providing lancets (1) in a magazine comprising

i) a drive unit which has a drive element (6) that is moved from a resting position into a lancing position in order to carry out a lancing process;
ii) a storage area to store the lancets (1);
iii) a withdrawal area to guide at least the tip (5) of a lancet (1) out of the system during the lancing process; and
iv) a transport unit (18) which can transport lancets from the storage area into the withdrawal area,

wherein the drive element (6) is arranged in such a manner that in the withdrawal area it acts on the lancet (1) located there to carry out a lancing process and thus moves the lancet from its resting position into a lancing position and

wherein the lancing device has a central retraction device (7) in the withdrawal area which interacts with the lancet (1) located in the withdrawal area while the lancet is moved from the lancing position into its resting position in order to carry out the lancing process, wherein the drive unit and the retraction device (7) act independently of one another on the lancet (1) 
characterized in that
 different lancets (1) are returned by only one retraction device (7).
