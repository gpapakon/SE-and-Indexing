<DESCRIPTION>
 SURGICAL DRAPEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to surgical drapes, and more particularly to surgical drapes suitable for spinal intervention procedures.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONDrapes are used during surgical procedures to create and maintain a sterile environment about the surgical site. Draping materials are selected to create and maintain an effective barrier that minimizes the passage of microorganisms between non-sterile and sterile areas. To be effective, a barrier material should be resistant to blood, aqueous fluid, and abrasion, as lint-free as possible, and drapable. When used during surgery, drapes prevent blood and other bodily fluids from contaminating the sterile field.A variety of surgical drapes exist, but most share several common features. Most drapes are made of a water-repellent or water-impermeable material, or are coated with such a material, to prevent the passage of bodily fluids as well as contaminating microorganisms. Many of today's surgical drapes are made of disposable nonwoven fabrics, plastic film, or papers.Surgical drapes will commonly have an opening or aperture (more commonly known in the medical field as a "fenestration") through which the surgical procedure is performed. In certain procedures, more than one surgical site is used. In these more complex procedures, the patient must be draped using a plurality of drapes or must be re- draped between procedures.An adhesive material may be attached to the periphery of the drape material about the fenestration so that the drape can be held in place around the surgical site and so that blood will not pass between the drape and the patient's body. The combination of the drape itself and the adhesive material around the perimeter of the aperture ensures a barrier between the surgical wound and the remainder of the body. Some drapes utilize incise materials which extend over the fenestration. The incise materials are typically transparent plastic films having an adhesive side which adheres to the surgical site of the patient. In such draping systems, the drape is secured to the patient by at least the incise material.Electric cords and suction lines running along the patient are usually clamped or tied to the edges of the outer sheet on the surgical table. These cords or lines can 

become entangled, and when pulled may cause devices to fall to the floor and become unsterile. The clamps and ties are usually not versatile or strong enough to allow easy addition or removal of tubes and electrical

<CLAIMS>
I claim:
1. A surgical drape for covering a patient during a surgical procedure, the drape comprising: a base sheet having an upper surface, a lower surface, a forward edge, and a rearward edge;
a primary fenestration formed in the base sheet through which a surgical procedure may be performed when the drape is covering a patient;
at least one secondary fenestration formed in the base sheet through which a second surgical procedure may be performed when the drape is covering a patient; and
a reinforcement panel disposed about the primary fenestration, the reinforcement panel being positioned on the upper surface of the base sheet and having a reinforcement fenestration that is aligned with the primary fenestration.
2. The drape of claim 1 , further including an incise layer extending across the primary and secondary fenestrations, the incise layer having an adhesive side that is adapted to adhere to the patient when the drape is covering the patient.
3. The drape of claim 1 , the drape adapted to be positionable over the patient so that the primary fenestration is disposed proximate to the spine of the patient, and the secondary fenestration is disposed proximate to the bone graft site of the patient.
4. The drape of claim 1 , further including at least one pouch attached to the upper surface of the drape.
5. The drape of claim 4, the pouch adapted to hold surgical instruments. 

6. The drape of claim 4, the pouch including an upper portion which is attached to the upper surface of the drape, and further including a lower portion which is releasably attachable to the upper surface of the drape.
7. The drape of claim 6, the lower portion of the pouch including at least one hook-type fastener.
8. The drape of claim 1 having two secondary fenestrations.
9. The drape of claim 8, the primary fenestration having a lower portion disposed nearest the rearward edge of the base sheet, the secondary fenestrations being positioned proximate to the lower portion of the primary fenestration.
10. The surgical drape of claim 1 , the drape being folded so that the primary fenestration is visible.
11. The surgical drape of claim 10, the drape being folded so that the lower side of the drape is visible.
12. The surgical drape of claim 1 , further including a diagram illustrating how to apply the drape to the patient for spinal surgery.
13. The surgical drape of claim 1 , the reinforcement panel disposed about the primary and secondary fenestrations.
