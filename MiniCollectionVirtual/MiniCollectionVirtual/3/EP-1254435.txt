<ABSTRACT>
A document (e.g. banknote) authenticating apparatus comprises a transport system (32-34, 50, 51) for transporting banknotes. An inspection device (35) is provided past which banknotes are transported by the transport system, the inspection device including a UV source (1) such as a LED and a UV detector (4, 5) arranged to irradiate a banknote and to detect reflected UV respectively. A processor (11) is responsible to the reflected UV to determine the authenticity of the banknote. The inspection device (35) includes a reference surface (3) over which the banknotes are transported in use, the reference surface being exposed to UV radiation from the source (1) in the absence of a banknote so as to generate a reference level signal, and being oriented such that the banknotes are delivered at an acute angle to the surface whereby passage of a banknote across the surface effects a cleaning action on the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for
authenticating documents of value such as banknotes.It is well known that the response of banknotes to
ultraviolet irradiation can be used to authenticate the
banknotes as genuine. This may involve monitoring the
amount of UV radiation reflected by the banknote and/or the
amount of fluorescent light emitted by the banknote in
response to UV radiation. Examples of known techniques are
described in US-A-4296326, EP-A-0679279 and EP-A-0807904.It is important to be able to calibrate the UV source
at regular intervals and a conventional approach to this is
described in EP-A-0807904 in which a piece of white
fluorescent paper is fed through the system. It is also
known to provide a surface of known colour opposite to the
radiation source as part of the banknote guide system.
However, in the latter case, dirt can build up on the
reference surface during use to an extent that it no longer
provides a reliable reference surface.WO-A-95/19019 discloses a method of detecting
counterfeit banknotes by detecting ultraviolet light at a
sample from a source and measuring the level of ultraviolet
light reflected from the sample using a first photocell and
the amount of fluorescent light generated by the sample
using a second photocell. The detected levels are compared
with reference levels and only if both reflective and
fluorescent criteria are satisfied is the note declared
genuine. The sample, during test, is swiped over a glass
window, preferably under an overlying shield.In accordance with the present invention, an
authenticating apparatus for documents of value comprises
a transport system for transporting the document; an
inspection device past which the documents are transported
by the transport system, the inspection device including a
UV source and a UV detector arranged to irradiate a
document and to detect reflected UV 
respectively; and a processor responsive to the reflected
UV to determine the authenticity of the document, the
inspection device including a reference surface over which
the documents are transported in use, the reference surface
being exposed to UV radiation from the source in the
absence of a document so as to generate a reference level
signal, and being oriented such that the documents are
delivered at an acute angle to the surface whereby passage
of a document across the surface effects a cleaning action
on the surface. We have devised a modified arrangement in which the
passage of documents can be used to clean the reference
surface thus
