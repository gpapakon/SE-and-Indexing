<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns ether derivatives and more
particularly ether derivatives which are inhibitors of the enzyme
5-lipoxygenase (hereinafter referred to as 5-LO). The invention also
concerns processes for the manufacture of said ether derivatives and
novel pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Also included in
the invention is the use of said ether derivatives in the treatment of
various diseases such as inflammatory and/or allergic diseases in
which the direct or indirect products of 5-LO catalysed oxidation of
arachidonic acid are involved, and the production of new medicaments
for such use.As stated above the ether derivatives described hereinafter
are inhibitors of 5-LO, which enzyme is known to be involved in
catalysing the oxidation of arachidonic acid to give rise via a
cascade process to the physiologically active leukotrienes such as
leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and the peptido-lipid leukotrienes such as
leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and various
metabolites.The biosynthetic relationship and physiological properties
of the leukotrienes are summarised by G.W. Taylor and S.R. Clarke in
Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 1986, 7, 100-103. The
leukotrienes and their metabolites have been implicated in the
production and development of various diseases, for example various
inflammatory and allergic diseases such as inflammation of the joints
(especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout),
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially inflammatory
bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), skin diseases
(especially psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis), ocular conditions
(especially allergic conjunctivitis and uveitis) and respiratory
disease (especially asthma, bronchitis and allergic rhinitis), for
example in the production and development of various cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular disorders such as myocardial infarction, the
formation of atherosclerotic plaques, hypertension, platelet
aggregation, angina, stroke, reperfusion injury, vascular injury
including restenosis and peripheral vascular disease, for example in 
the formation of the conditions of shock or trauma such as can follow
burn injuries, toxaemia or surgery, and for example various disorders
of bone metabolism such as osteoporosis (including senile and
postmenopausal osteoporosis), Paget's disease, bone metastases,
hypercalcaemia, hyperparathyroidism, osteosclerosis, osteopetrosis and
periodontitis, and the abnormal changes in bone metabolism which may
accompany rheumatoid arthritis and
