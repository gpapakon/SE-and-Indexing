<ABSTRACT>
System transmit a control signal between a rotating element and a stationary element of a blood separation centrifuge (78). An interface control system (234) mounts the element that views the interface on a rotating element of the centrifuge. The interface control system (234) includes a light source (236) and a light detector (244) on a viewing head (238) and a data link (278) for transmitting light intensity signals from the viewing head (238) to an interface control circuit (270) on the stationary frame of the centrifuge (78). The data link (278) includes an intensity control circuit (252) which adjusts the input to the light source (236) and a second light source (254).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part
of U.S. Patent
Application Serial Number 07/814,403 entitled
"Centrifuge with Separable Bowl and Spool Elements
Providing Access to the Separation Chamber," filed
December 23, 1991. This application is also a
continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial
Number 07/748,244 entitled "Centrifugation Pheresis
System," filed August 21, 1991, which is itself a
continuation of U. S. Patent Application Serial No.
07/514,995, filed May 26, 1989, which is itself a
continuation of U. S. Patent Application Serial No.
07/009,179, filed January 30, 1987 (now U.S. Patent
4,834,890).The invention relates to centrifugal
processing systems and apparatus.Today blood collection organizations
routinely separate whole blood by centrifugation into 
its various therapeutic components, such as red blood
cells, platelets, and plasma.Conventional blood processing systems and
methods use durable centrifuge equipment in
association with single use, sterile processing
chambers, typically made of plastic. The centrifuge
equipment introduces whole blood into these chambers
while rotating them to create a centrifugal field.Whole blood separates within the rotating
chamber under the influence of the centrifugal field
into higher density red blood cells and platelet-rich
plasma. An intermediate layer of white blood cells
and lymphocytes forms an interface between the red
blood cells and platelet-rich plasma.In conventional blood separation systems and
methods, it is necessary to monitor operation
conditions within the rotating blood processing field. US-A-4557719 discloses a blood separation centrifuge, in which an
interface is monitored by passing light through the centrifuge. A light
emitter and light detector are stationary at opposite sides of the rotatable
centrifuge bowl.A blood separation centrifuge of the double-rotor type providing
data transmission between the rotatable elements and the stationary
element without mechanical contacts between said elements is
disclosed un US-A-4724317.The precharacterising part of Claim 1 is based on US-A-4557719
and the distinguishing features of the invention are set out in the
characterising part of Claim 1.US-A-404559 discloses a rotative coupling in which signals
representing measurements of stress or temperature on a rotating part may
be transmitted via slip rings to the stationary part. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic view of an enhanced
yield axial flow processing chamber;Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view of the chamber
