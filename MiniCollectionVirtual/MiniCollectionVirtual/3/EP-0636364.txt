<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a compressed pharmaceutical 
dosage form containing pharmaceutical particles 

coated with a taste-masking composition, a water-disintegratable, 
compressible carbohydrate and a binder. 

These components are dry blended and compressed into a 
dosage form, such as a tablet, having a hardness sufficient 

to cause the carbohydrate to disintegrate within 30 
seconds after oral administration, thereby allowing the 

coated particles to be swallowed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rapidly disintegrating
pharmaceutical dosage form containing coated
pharmaceutical particles and to a process for preparing
such dosage forms.Rapidly disintegrating or dissolving pharmaceutical
dosage forms are available for human patients who have
difficulty swallowing conventional tablets or capsules,
and for the sublingual and buccal administration of drugs.Freeze-dried or lyophilized dosage forms are generally
known to rapidly dissolve or disintegrate in the mouth.
These forms consist of a porous matrix of a water-soluble
or water-dispersible carrier material which is impregnated
with a unit dose of the pharmaceutical active. These
dosage forms are prepared by first adding the pharmaceutical
active to a solution comprising the carrier material
and a suitable solvent, typically water. The resulting
composition is then subjected to a freeze drying procedure
whereby the solvent sublimes under a high vacuum.While freeze-dried dosage forms dissolve rapidly,
they must be manufactured on expensive lyophilization
equipment. Further, these dosage forms have generally
only been used with water-insoluble actives that are
relatively tasteless, because they disintegrate in the 
mouth, rather than being swallowed as in the case of
conventional tablets and capsules.Water-soluble drugs are generally avoided in freeze-dried
dosage forms because of the dissolution of the drug
in the mouth, which results in a bitter or otherwise
objectionable taste. Further problems can arise when
water-soluble drugs are used because of the formation of
eutectic mixtures, which lower the freezing point of the
formulation, resulting in incomplete freezing or melting
during the freeze-drying process. This phenomenon results
in product loss.M. S. Amer in U.S. Patent 4,866,046, issued September
12, 1989, describes an aspirin tablet that rapidly
dissolves in the oral, preferably sublingual, cavity
within 2-60 seconds. This tablet provides rapid
absorption of aspirin from the saliva into the blood
stream. The sublingual tablet is prepared by compressing
into slugs a mixture of starch (10% moisture), acetylsalicylic
acid, flavor and sweetener. The slugs are then
ground (14-16 Mesh size) and recompressed into tablets.
An amino acid may also be used with the aspirin for its
solubilizing and a taste-neutralizing effects.U.S. Patent No. 5,082,667, issued January 21, 1992,
to K. G. Van Scoik discusses a tablet triturate dosage
that quickly dissolves in the buccal cavity. The
form includes a porous, cementatory

A compressed pharmaceutical dosage form, comprising:

at least one coated particle comprising at least one
pharmaceutical coated with a taste-masking coating;
a water-disintegratable, compressible carbohydrate; and
a binder,

said dosage form having a hardness within the range of about 1.0 to about 3.0 kp and sufficient to cause said
carbohydrate to disintegrate within 30 seconds after oral

administration, thereby allowing said particle to be
swallowed.

pharmaceutical coated with a blend of a first polymer which
is a cellulose acetate or cellulose acetate butyrate and a

second polymer which is polyvinyl pyrrolidone or
hydroxypropyl cellulose, wherein the weight ratio of the

first polymer to the second polymer is within the range of
about 90:10 to about 50:50.
A pharmaceutical dosage form of any one of claims 1 to 3 being a compressed wafer,
comprising:


coated particles comprising at least one pharmaceutical
coated with a blend of a first polymer which is a cellulose

acetate or cellulose acetate butyrate and a second polymer
which is polyvinyl pyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl cellulose,

polymer is within the range of about 90:10 to about 50:50;
a water-disintegratable, compressible carbohydrate which is
mannitol, sorbitol, dextrose, sucrose, xylitol, lactose, or 
a mixture thereof; and
a binder which is cellulose, a cellulosic derivative,
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, starch, modified starch or a mixture

thereof,

to about 1.91 cm (3/4 inch), a thickness of about 0.13 cm (0.05 inch) to about 1.27 cm (0.5

inch), and a hardness of about 1.5 to about 2.5 kp.
The wafer of claim 4 or claim 5 comprising:

about 0.5 to about 600 mg of said coated particles;
about 250 to about 750 mg of said carbohydrate; and
about 20 to about 100 mg of said binder,

and which optionally additionally comprises:

about 4 to about 10 mg of a lubricant;
about 1 to about 10 mg of a color;
about 1 to about 10 mg of a sweetener; and
about 1 to about 10 of a flavor.
The pharmaceutical dosage form of any one of claims
3 to 6 wherein the coated particle comprises about 5 to

about 60 percent by weight of the blend of first and second
polymers.
The pharmaceutical dosage form of any one of claims
