<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates in general to an animal model that is useful for developing 
therapeutic drugs of a disease. More in detail, the present invention relates to 

the creation of transgenic animals having an exogenous gene construct coding a 
part of β-amyloid precursor protein (hereinafter called APP) in their genome. 

The exogenous gene construct is designed to overexpress in various types of 
the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to an animal model that is useful for developing 
therapeutic drugs of a disease. More in detail, the present invention relates to 
the creation of transgenic animals having an exogenous gene construct coding a 
part of β-amyloid precursor protein (hereinafter called APP) in their genome. 
The exogenous gene construct is designed to overexpress in various types of 
the cells. Recent development of genetic engineering has made it possible to create 
embryos (so-called transformed embryos) into which the said gene construct is 
integrated by microinjection of an exogenous gene construct (DNA) into the 
nuclei of 1-cell stage embryos or by infection of preimplantation embryos with 
retroviral vector DNA (Gordon J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, Vol. 77, p. 
7380-7384, 1980; Jaenisch R. et al., Cell, Vol. 32, p. 209-216, 1983). The 
resulting embryos can further develop to full term after the transfer into the 
oviducts/uteri of recipient foster mothers. Some of the resulting adult animals 
have the exogenous DNA integrated into their genome and to express the DNA 
in its tissues. These "transformed" animals are generally called transgenic 
animals (Gordon J. and Ruddle F.I Science, Vol. 214, p. 1244-1246, 1981). 
The integrated exogenous DNA is called transgene, generally consisting of a 
promoter and a target gene (encoding a protein that is desired to be expressed) 
and others. The transgene expression can be made even before maturation; for 
example, in some cases, the expression occurs in the cleavage stage of an 
embryo. As a result of the expression, a protein produced by the transgene is 
produced. If the said protein play a crucial role on the morphogenetic pathway 
of individuals, some phenotypic alteration may occur at a certain stage of 
development. For giving a phenotypic alteration in transgenic animals, two  
 
approaches are possible; 1) overexpression of a target protein in a targeted 
tissue(s) and 2) suppression of endogenous target gene expression by 
anti-sense gene technology (Katsuki M. et al., Science, Vol. 241, p. 593-595, 
1988) and others. These are based upon an usage of tissue-specific or 
ubiquitous promoter and/or enhancer, both of which should be placed at the 
upstream target gene. Up to date, there are many reports to show that transgenic animals exhibited 
alteration of their original phenotypes due to expression of a transgene. These 
are mentioned in detail in the reviews by Palmiter R. D. and Brinster R. L. 
(Annu. Rev. of
