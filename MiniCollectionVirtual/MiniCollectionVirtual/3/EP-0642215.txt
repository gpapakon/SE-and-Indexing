<ABSTRACT>
An oscillator which inhibits unwanted oscillations and requires a 
comparatively small power supply voltage is described. The oscillator comprises an 

amplifier transistor 110 (220), an output current of which flows into the emitter of a 
load transistor 120 (220) 
via
 a load signal path. The amplifier stage acquires a bandpass 
characteristic by means of a passive capacitive bootstrap signal transfer from this signal 

path to the base of the load transistor. The oscillator thus preferably oscillates within the 
passband of the amplifier stage. The amplifier stage has a comparatively large gain 

within the passband even without a load resistor in the load signal path. Such a load 
resistor would cause a voltage drop and, hence, increase the required power supply 

voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an amplifier stage comprising an amplifier transistor and a load transistor, a
load signal path from a collector of the amplifier transistor to an emitter of the load
transistor, to which load signal path the resonator is coupled, and a bootstrap signal
transfer from the load signal path to the base of the load transistor, which base is
coupled to a reference voltage conductor via a bias resistor, and to an oscillator including a resonator which is coupled to the load signal path of such an amplifier stage.An oscillator of this type is known per se from Japanese Patent
publication Kokai 2-21708. Fig. 1 shows the known oscillator. An amplifier stage of the
type described in the opening paragraph comprises Q2 as an amplifier transistor and Q5
as a load transistor. The base of the load transistor Q5 is coupled to the positive power
supply voltage via bias resistor R7. The load signal path from the collector of Q2 to the
emitter of Q5 comprises a load resistor R2. Resonator 15 is coupled to the load signal
path. The bootstrap signal transfer from the load signal path to the base of Q5 (point
17) is effected from the collector of Q2 (point 11) and proceeds via transistor Q4,
emitter resistors R6 and R5 and transistor Q3 which constitute a differential stage.
Together with transistor Q5 and load resistor R2, this differential stage constitutes a
local positive feedback loop. Resonator 15, coupling capacitors C2 and C3, driver
transistor Q1 and the amplifier stage form part of an oscillation loop.The known oscillator can start oscillating at a frequency determined by the
resonator. To this end, the amplifier stage is to compensate for the signal losses which
occur in the resonator 15 and the coupling capacitors C2 and C3 so that the loop gain in
the oscillation loop is larger than one.A practical resonator generally has different resonance frequencies, for
example, because the elements of the resonator comprise unwanted reactances such as a
self- inductance caused by the connection terminals in a capacitor, or, for example as a
result of inductive and capacitive couplings between two different conductors. An 
illustrative example is a soldering point on a conductor constituting a capacitance of
approximately 0.5 picoFarad to a proximate conductor.Resonator 15 of the known oscillator may be, for example an LC circuit
provided with varicap diodes, used in a UHF television tuner. Fig. 2a illustrates the
attenuation T(R) of the positive feedback network in the known oscillator constituted
