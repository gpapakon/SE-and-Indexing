<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fields of
pharmaceutical and organic chemistry, and provides novel
anomeric 2,2-difluororibosyl azide intermediates and 2,2-difluororibosyl
amine intermediates, each of which is
useful in the preparation of 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides.
The invention further relates to
processes for preparing intermediate and pharmacologically
active compounds.Methods for preparing 2'-deoxynucleosides for
use as antiviral and antineoplastic agents are generally
known in the art of pharmaceutical chemistry. Typically,
the art teaches that 2'-deoxynucleosides may be prepared by
first preparing a desired carbohydrate, independently
preparing a desired base, and condensing the two components
to form the desired product; see e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
5,118,820.More specifically, U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,374
discloses the preparation of protected 2,2-difluorolactone
intermediates having up to two centers of chirality. One
such intermediate having a chiral center consists of
erythro and threo enantiomers of the formulae

wherein P is a protecting group. The patent teaches the
erythro enantiomer, which is preferred, because it provides
a carbohydrate which has the stereochemistry of naturally
occurring ribose. A carbohydrate having the 
stereochemistry of naturally occurring ribose is preferred
because it provides final product nucleosides which exhibit
superior biological activity.A second intermediate, taught in the U.S. Pat.
No. 4,965,374, possesses a third chiral center which is
produced at the anomeric C-1 carbon atom when the carbonyl
portion of the lactone is converted to the respective
alcohol. The two resulting anomers for the desired erythro
configuration are identified as α and β anomers of the
formulae
In this method of preparing
2,2-difluoronucleosides, the hydroxy group at the 1-position
is ultimately replaced by a heterocyclic base such
as cytosine o provide protected precursors to the
biologically active 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides.
This β-anomer precursor is preferred because it provides,
after deprotection, 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides
which possess superior biological activity.J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1980, 2304 describes the synthesis of some nucleosides wherein
an arabinosylamine is condensed with ethyl-N-(carbamoylcyanomethyl) formimidate to give
the corresponding nucleoside. The arabinosylamine is obtained from 2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl
arabinofuranosyl chloride and sodium azide, followed by catalytic reduction of the glycosyl
azide produced. The reference does not refer to
