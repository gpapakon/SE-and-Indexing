<ABSTRACT>
A pipework (or cabling) duct is formed in a floor from channel members having a generally rectangular U-shape section with inwardly directed flanges (50) on the opposed walls to support a lid. Flooring of the type having a solid base, rigid insulating material on the base and board as a surface layer is then cut to remove the surface layer and insulation in the pattern required, the channel members are located in the cut-outs and attached to the surface layer boarding and, after installation of the pipework or cabling, the lid (53) is fitted. This can be formed from the cut out portions of the surface layer, but is preferably an inverted channel-shaped extrusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a channel member for use in forming a 
pipework duct in a floor, to a floor including such pipework ducting, 
and to a method of forming pipework ducting in a floor. In locating, for example, central heating pipework in buildings having 
solid floors, it has been a common practice simply to embed the pipes, 
possibly within a sheath of insulation, within the concrete of the 
floor. This arrangement gives rise to problems if a leaking pipe is to 
be repaired after installation, or the layout of the installation is to 
be changed. It is desirable, therefore, to locate pipework in ducting 
to which access may more readily be gained for subsequent work on the 
pipes, and in the UK such an arrangement is now provided for by 
regulations. For convenience in forming such ducting, plastics channel 
members may be bedded in the concrete during formation of the floor, 
the channel members being provided with outwardly extending flanges 
which are supported by the underlying concrete and which in turn serve 
for location of a closure member for the channel. A problem which 
arises with such ducting is that, when forming the pipework, it is 
common practice to provide soldered joints, and the heat of the 
blowlamp used in the soldering operation can damage the plastics 
channel unless special care is taken. Further, the plastics channel is  
 
prone to mechanical damage during subsequent building operations before the floor 
is completed. In order to provide sufficient thermal insulation, another type of floor is becoming 
more common. This provides on top of the concrete oversite slab a layer of 
substantially rigid insulating material such as an expanded plastics material, with 
boards, typically wood chipboard or the like, resting on top of the insulating material. 
For this type of flooring, the conventional plastics ducting channel member is 
inappropriate, since its tapering form and low mechanical strength make satisfactory 
installation difficult. Examples of typical known ducts are described in NL-A-600598, 
FR-A-1 357 069 and US 3593472. The present invention provides a channel member adapted for use in forming a 
pipework duct in an existing floor, the channel member being formed of a rigid 
material and comprising a base having a wall upstanding therefrom along two 
opposite sides of the base, characterised by each wall having no outwardly extending 
projections but having an inwardly directed flange extending therefrom at a short 
distance from the upper edge of the wall, each

<CLAIMS>
A channel member (1) adapted for use in forming a pipework duct in an 
existing floor, the channel member (1) being formed of a rigid material and comprising 

a base (3) having a wall (2) upstanding therefrom along two opposite sides of the 
base (3) characterised by each wall having no outwardly extending projections but 

having an inwardly directed flange (4) extending therefrom at a short distance from 
the upper edge of the wall, each flange extending over a minor part of the width of the 

base. 
A channel member according to Claim 1, wherein each wall (2) is 
substantially at a right angle to the base (3). 
A channel member according to Claim 1 or 2, integrally formed as an 
extrusion. 
A floor of the type having a surface layer (22) supported by a layer of rigid 
insulating material (21) laid on the structural floor (20), the floor including pipework 

ducting comprising one or more channel members (1) according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
located within cut outs formed in the surface layer, the channel members (1) being 

attached to the adjacent surface layer and the ducting being closed by a closure 
member (25) located on the inwardly directed flanges. 
A floor according to Claim 4, wherein the ducting is closed by the portions of 
the surface layer which have been cut out.  

 
A floor according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein the or each channel member rests 
on the solid underlying base of the floor and is surrounded by insulating material 

beneath the surface layer. 
A method of forming pipework ducting in a floor of the type having a solid 
base (20), a layer of rigid insulating material (21) thereon, and an upper surface layer 

(22) of wooden or other board, comprising cutting through and removing the upper 
surface layer (22) and the insulating material (21) to form a cut out corresponding to 

the ducting pattern required, locating one or more channel members (1) as claimed in 
Claim 1, in the cut out so formed, securing the channel members (1) to the surface 

layer (22) within the cut out, and locating a closure member (25) on the flanges of the 

channel to close the duct. 
A method according to Claim 7, wherein the closure member is formed by 
the removed portion of the surface layer. 
A method according to Claim 7 or 8, comprising locating pipework or cabling 
within the ducting and surrounding the pipework or cabling within the ducting and 

surrounding the pipework or cabling with insulating material before closing the duct. 
A method according to Claim 7, 8 or 9, wherein the channel member (1) is 
integrally formed as an extrusion.
