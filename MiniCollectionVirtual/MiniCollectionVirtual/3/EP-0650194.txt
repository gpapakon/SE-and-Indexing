<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data transmission schemes, and, more 
particularly, to data transmission schemes including mechanisms for reducing 
unwanted coupling between signal paths. For any data transmission event, a received signal consists of the 
transmitted signal, modified by various distortions imposed by the transmission 
signal, plus additional unwanted signals that are inserted somewhere between 
transmission and reception. The latter, undesired signals are referred to as 
noise. It is noise that is the major limiting factor in communications system 
performance.  
 Noise may generally be divided into four categories: thermal noise, 
intermodulation noise, impulse noise and crosstalk. Each of these four 
categories of noise is discussed in an individual paragraph immediately below. Thermal noise is noise caused by thermal agitation of electrons in a 
conductor. It is present in all electronic devices and transmission media and 
is a function of temperature. Thermal noise is uniformly distributed across the 
frequency spectrum and hence is often referred to as white noise. Thermal 
noise cannot be eliminated and therefore places an upper bound on 
communications system performance. Intermodulation noise can arise when signals at different frequencies 
share the same transmission medium. The effect of intermodulation noise is 
to produce signals at a frequency which is the sum or difference of the two 
original frequencies or multiples of those frequencies. Intermodulation noise 
is produced when there is some nonlinearity in the transmitter, receiver, or 
intervening transmission system. Nonlinearity can be caused by component 
malfunction or by use of excessive signal strength. Impulse noise is unpredictable and noncontinuous, consisting of 
irregular pulses or noise spikes of short duration and of relatively high 
amplitude. It may be generated from a variety of causes, including external 
electromagnetic disturbances, such as lightening, and faults and flaws in the 
communications system. Crosstalk, the fourth major category of noise, is an unwanted coupling 
between signal paths. There is inevitably a certain amount of parasitic 
capacitance between long lines routed in parallel. This capacitance can cause 
coupling problems; specifically, a line can unintentionally change polarity if 
adjacent lines change, resulting in incorrect data being transferred.  
 Historically, crosstalk has been generally considered to be a problem 
of the same order of magnitude as, or less than, thermal
