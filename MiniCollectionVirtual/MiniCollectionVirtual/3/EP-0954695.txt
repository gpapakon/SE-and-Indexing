<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dual nozzle (3) for injecting fuel and an additional fluid into a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, comprising a nozzle body (3.0) which has at least one admission bore (3.2) for supplying fuel into the dual nozzle, said fuel being at high pressure, and nozzle bores (3.8) for injecting fuel from the dual nozzle into the combustion chamber. The invention is characterised in that a preferably metal jacket (7) is arranged around the nozzle body. Said jacket (7) surrounds a hollow cavity (8) bordering at least the outer surface of the nozzle body, especially running around the nozzle body, for receiving an additional fluid, and in that a delivery line (5) for delivering the pressurised additional fluid to the hollow cavity and one or several injection nozzles for injecting additional fluid from the hollow cavity into the combustion chamber are provided. The fuel and the additional fluid are injected strictly separately so that it is impossible for the two fluids to mix before they reach the combustion chamber. The nozzle body and the especially the area of the nozzle dome are cooled by the additional fluid to be injected being guided outside which prevents the nozzle bores from coking. Only one magnetic valve is required in addition for measuring the quantity of fuel to be injected when using the inventive dual nozzle.

into the combustion space can be varied structurally by

an appropriate choice of the geometry of the casing (7)
at its lower end capable of being lifted off and of the

nozzle body (3.0) in the lower bearing region of the
casing (7), preferably by a choice of the relative
