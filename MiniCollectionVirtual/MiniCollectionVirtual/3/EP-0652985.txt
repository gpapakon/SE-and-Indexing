<ABSTRACT>
A wire comprising at least one helically wound wire element is disclosed. The helical winding consists of a platinoid or platinoid alloy wire (20). Also disclosed are assemblies of these wires (20) such as knitted materials, fabrics and felts, and the use of said assemblies as catalysers in the reaction for preparing nitric or cyanhydric acid, and to recover precious metals from these catalysers.
