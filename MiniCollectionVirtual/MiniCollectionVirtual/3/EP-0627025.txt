<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
automatically dispensing an additive into a machine, and more 
particularly to an apparatus for automatically dispensing 
detergent into a laundry machine. Laundry machines typically utilize a washing 
process that includes a wash cycle, a rinse cycle, and a spin 
cycle. During the wash cycle, water is automatically 
injected into the washtub of the laundry machine to wet the 
laundry, detergent is added into the washtub, and the washtub 
is agitated to wash the laundry. During the rinse cycle, 
water is injected into the washtub to remove residual 
detergent from the laundry. During the spin cycle, the 
washtub is rotated at a high speed to remove water from the 
laundry. To operate properly, laundry machines require that 
a proper amount of detergent be added into the washtub of the 
laundry machine at a proper time during the wash cycle. The 
detergent is usually added manually by the operator of the 
laundry machine. There are many drawbacks associated with dispensing 
detergent manually. For example, manual dispensing requires 
the attention of the operator during the wash cycle and, 
therefore, is inconvenient and time consuming. Also, manual 
dispensing of the detergent creates an opportunity for 
operator error, such as neglecting to dispense detergent or 
dispensing too much detergent, which would adversely affect 
the performance of the laundry machine. There are operator activated systems for laundry 
machines that automatically dispense detergent. Such systems 
include devices having a timing mechanism that is external to 
the laundry machine. The timing mechanism is synchronized 
with the washing process of the laundry machine and indicates 
when detergent should be dispensed into the washtub. The  
 
timing process begins when the timing mechanism is activated 
manually by the operator of the laundry machine. Problems exist with an external non-synchronized 
timing system. For example, if the operator does not 
activate the timing mechanism at the proper time, the timing 
of the dispensing system will not be synchronized with the 
timing of the laundry machine. Also, since the timing 
mechanism is not directly connected to the controller of the 
laundry machine, the timing mechanism may not be properly 
synchronized with the laundry machine. Another known type of detergent dispensing system 
is directly connected to the controller or timing mechanism 
that controls the operation of the laundry machine. In this 
type of system, the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (22) for automatically dispensing an additive 
(12) into a machine (14), comprising: 


means (40) for conveying the additive to the machine; characterized by 
means (42) for detecting when a predetermined amount of 
electrical current is drawn by the machine and for 

transmitting a signal, in response to the detection of the 
predetermined amount of electrical current, indicating 

that the conveying means should commence conveyance of the 
additive. 
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a means (50) 
for delaying commencement of the additive. 
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a means (58) 
for controlling the amount of additive that is conveyed by 

the conveying means to the machine. 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the means for conveying 
the additive to the machine includes a pump (24). 
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the pump is a 
peristaltic pump. 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the machine includes an 
external power line that is to be connected to an external 

power source to power the machine and the detecting means 
(42) detects electrical current drawn by the machine from 

the external power source.  
 
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the means (50) for 
delaying commencement of the additive includes means for 

delaying transmission of the signal transmitted by the 
detecting means for a predetermined period of time. 
The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the predetermined period 
of time is determined by a timer (52). 
The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the timer is adjustable. 
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the means (58) for 
controlling the amount of additive that is conveyed by the 

conveying means (40) includes means for controlling the 
length of time that the conveying means is activated. 
The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the means for 
controlling the length of time that the conveying means is 

activated includes a timer. 
The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the timer is 
adjustable. 
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising means for 
preventing multiple conveyance of the additive to the 

machine after a decrease in electrical power drawn by the 
machine for less than a predetermined period of time. 
The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the means for 
preventing multiple conveyance of the additive includes 

means for timing the predetermined period of time. 
The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the means for timing 
the predetermined period of time is adjustable. 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the machine is a laundry 
machine.  

 
The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the additive is laundry 
detergent. 
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the apparatus includes a 
housing (23), including a receptacle, and a power line for 

connection to the external power source, the apparatus 
power line providing electrical current to both the 

apparatus and the machine when the power line of the 
machine is connected to the receptacle and the apparatus 

power line is connected to the power source.
