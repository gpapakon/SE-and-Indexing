<ABSTRACT>
A control method/system for controlling upshifting in an automated 
mechanical transmission system (10) provided with an engine compression brake 

(50) is provided. A control unit (54) is effective to operate the engine 
compression brake during a transmission upshift such that at initiation of an 

upshift the engine compression brake applies a minimum retarding torque to said 
engine, said retarding torque is then gradually increased to a maximum retarding 

torque value and, upon sensing that engine speed (ES) is within a predetermined 

value (REF‚ÇÅ) of the synchronous value thereof, the retarding torque applied by 
said engine brake is caused to gradually decrease until such time as engine speed 

reaches the synchronous window therefor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system/method for controlling the 
shifting of vehicular fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems 
of the type including an engine equipped with an engine brake and, in particular, 
relates to a control system/method of the above-described type which is effective 
to automatically apply the engine brake in a modulated manner in achieve rapid 
and smooth upshifting. Vehicular fully and partially automated mechanical transmission systems 
are known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to United States Patents 
Nos. 4,361,060; 4,595,986; 4,648,290; 4722,248 and 5,050,427. Such fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems typically 
include a microprocessor based controller for issuing command output signals to 
various controllers to implement selected transmission shifts, including 
manipulation of the engine fueling and/or of engine or input shaft brakes to cause 
the transmission input shaft to rotate at a substantially synchronous speed for a 
given output shaft speed and target gear ratio. Engine brakes, usually called "engine compression brakes" or "exhaust 
brakes" are well known in the prior art and such devices, such as the well known 
"Jake Brake", are commonly provided on heavy duty vehicles. These devices are 
typically manually operated, may provide variable retardation by manual selection 
of one, two or three banks of cylinders operation, and are utilized to retard the 
vehicle and, in recent developments, to quickly retard engine/input shaft speed for 
more rapid synchronization during an upshift. Examples of vehicular automated 
mechanical transmission systems utilizing engine compression brakes may be seen  
 
by reference to United States Patent Nos. 4,993,850 and 5,043, 327. Generally, engine compression brakes are selective to alter, usually 
hydraulically, the engine valve timing/porting so that a relatively large compressive 
force and resistance is provided to rotation of the engine from rotational inertia and as 
caused by the vehicle drive wheels acting through to drive axles, drive shaft, 
transmission and master clutch. In a known prior art system, described in US-A-4787,044 the exhaust brake 
and fuel supply apparatus work together to control engine speed in relation to 
transmission input shaft speed. In another known automated mechanical transmission systems the engine 
braking system can be controlled selectively as well as manually. The selective control 
of the engine braking system can
