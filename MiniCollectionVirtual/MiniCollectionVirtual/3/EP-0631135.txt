<ABSTRACT>
Sampled pulp suspension is diluted by adding water and 
separated into foreign matter and effective fiber. The 

water containing separated foreign matter is the object to 
be detected. Foreign matter in the pulp suspension is 

detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for detecting and determining the average
value of foreign materials contained in pulp suspension as acknowledged in
claim 1.In a papermaking process, foreign matter mixed with paper materials causes
break (break deteriorates operational performance of a paper machine and increases
the production cost) and deteriorates the quality of paper as a commercial product, and
consequently, foreign matter in pulp suspension is removed by using a screen, a cleaner,
or the like. It is important to check the state of foreign matter in the pulp suspension
(such as whether a large amount of foreign matter is present, or the like) which is fed
to the papermaking process. Thus, conventionally, the state of foreign matter, such as dust, contained
in the pulp suspension is checked by the following method. The pulp suspension per se
is extracted and a handmade sample sheet is produced from the extracted pulp suspension.
Foreign matter in the sample sheet is counted, or foreign matter in paper as a
finished product is counted.However, in this method, feedback to the machine in the papermaking
process is delayed, and thus, a quick response is not achievable.In order to overcome the above drawbacks, the following method is
available these days. Light strikes the pulp suspension per se, and the resulting reflected
light is detected and processed.In such a method, approximately 1 % concentration of the pulp
suspension enables the detection of foreign matter such as dust, or the like.However, when the pulp suspension is highly concentrated, it is difficult
to distinguish foreign matter, such as dust, from effective fiber, thus lowering measuring
precision.If the pulp in the pulp suspension is bleached, the effective fiber and
foreign matter in the pulp suspension can be distinguished by the difference of colors
(the contrast of colors). However, when the pulp suspension material is waste paper,
corrugated board, or the like, it is hard to distinguish foreign matter from effective
fiber in the pulp suspension, thus lowering measuring precision.US-A 4,225,385 discloses a method wherein a sample of pulp suspension
is diluted by adding water; the diluted sample passes a photometric window for detection.
A similar method is known from GB-A-2,087,071. An apparatus for detecting and determining the average value of foreign
materials contained in pulp suspension
is known from WO 86/05525 wherein a pulp sample is firstly diluted, then separated
into a foreign matter stream and a fiber laden stream;
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for detecting and determining the average
value of foreign materials contained in pulp suspension, comprising:


a) a pulp suspension introducing passage (5) for introducing pulp suspension
containing foreign materials and pulp components,
b) separating means (9) including a primary chamber (92) having an inlet
connected to the pulp suspension introducing passage (5) and an outlet, 
a
secondary chamber (93) situated adjacent to the primary chamber (92) and

having an outlet, and a screen (91) separating the first and second chambers
(92, 93) so that when the pulp suspension is introduced into the separating

means (9) through the primary chamber's inlet, the pulp components in the
pulp suspension pass through the screen (91) and the secondary chamber

(93) to exit from the secondary chamber's outlet and the foreign materials
remain in the primary chamber (92),
c) a circulation passage (20) connected between the primary chamber's inlet
and the primary chamber's outlet for circulating the pulp suspension

containing the foreign materials in the primary chamber (92) therethrough so
that the pulp suspension containing the foreign materials separated in the

primary chamber (92) circulates through the circulating passage, and
d) means (25, 25a, 31, 32) for detecting and determining the average value of
the foreign materials contained in the circulated pulp suspension, said

detecting means (25, 25a, 31, 32) being located in the circulation passage so
that the foreign materials contained in the pulp suspension after the pulp 

components are removed in the separating means are detected while the
liquid is circulating in the circulating passage to thereby accurately detect the

foreign materials in the pulp suspension.
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a water supply passage
(16) connected to the inlet of the primary chamber (92) so that the foreign materials

are diluted and suspended in water.
The apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said separating means further
includes a rotating member (94) situated inside the primary chamber (92) to prevent

the screen (91) from being clogged.
The apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising a discharge passage (14)
connected to the primary chamber's outlet for discharging the foreign materials after

detection.
The apparatus according to claim 4, further comprising opening and closing
means (7, 21, 15) situated in each of the pulp suspension introducing passage,

circulating passage and discharge passage for controlling flow of the passages.
