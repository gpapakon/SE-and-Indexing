<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
inexpensive Fe-Ni-Cr-base superalloy which is excellent 
in high-temperature strength, and an engine valve for a 
motor vehicle and a knitted mesh supporter for an 
exhaust gas catalyzer for a motor vehicle which are made 
of the alloy. In recent years, there has been an even more 
demand for saving energy and treating exhaust gas to 
solve the global problems of environmental pollutions 
whereas reduction of resources for manufacturing 
component parts has been desired. In order to achieve 
such objects, there has been a strong demand for 
reducing resources of high-quality materials such as an 
engine valve material and an exhaust gas mesh material 
which are exposed to the highest temperature and the 
highest stress in an internal combustion engine of a 
motor vehicle or the like. Conventionally, as a material for exhaust gas 
valves of a gasoline engine or a diesel engine, JIS 
SUH35 (Fe-8.5Mn-21Cr-4Ni-0.5C-0.4N) which is a high-Mn 
austenitic steel has been widely used. However, in 
accordance with an increase of the use temperature, JIS 
NCF751 (Ni-15.5Cr-1Nb-2.3Ti-1.2Al-7Fe) which is an Ni-base 
superalloy has started to be employed in some  
 
cases. However, JIS NCF751, which contains about 70 % 
Ni, is by far more expensive than JIS SUH35. Therefore, 
there have been developed alloys which contain less 
valuable alloying elements than JIS NCF751 and which 
have high-temperature strength and stability of alloy 
structure after long-time heating which are as close to 
those of JIS NCF751 as possible. As a result, there have been made many 
suggestions such as JP-B2-1-12827, JP-A-62-214149, JP-A-58-189359, 
JP-A-63-213631, JP-A-61-238942, JP-B2-62-50542, 
JP-B2-4-11613, JP-A-60-211028, JP-A- 56 020 148, US-A- 4 172 742 and so on. As gasoline fuel for engines of motor 
vehicles, lead-free gasoline has recently been employed 
for answering the demand of treatment of exhaust gas, 
and engines for which lead-free gasoline is exclusively 
used have been mainly produced. For the engine parts 
which are used at a particularly high temperature, such 
as engine valves and knitted mesh supporters for exhaust 
gas catalyzers for a motor vehicle, use of lead-free 
gasoline leads to an improvement of wear environment. 
If the same level of oxidation resistance property as JIS 
NCF751 is provided, no consideration must be given to 
the wear resistance property with respect to lead oxide, 
which has conventionally been a problem to be 
considered. On the other hand, in
