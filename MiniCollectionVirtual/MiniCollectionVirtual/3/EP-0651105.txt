<ABSTRACT>
Method and means for putting a panel 1 on a wall-construction, in which a 
C-shaped profile 2, comprising an elastic element 6 provided with lips 7 

snapping on the ends 8 of the legs 9, is fixed to the panel 1. 
The element 6 is provided with a groove 10, having an enlarged part 11 at its 
end. 
The wall-construction comprises a tongue-profile 16, having an outer enlarged 
part to which the groove of the elastic element 6 is pressed during the 

assembly of the panel 1. 
The wall-construction comprise screws 18 of which the central axes are parallel 
to the plane of the panel 1 and which fit in a groove 29 into a leg 9 of the 

C-shaped profile 2 and which serve to adjust and secure the panel 1 with 
respect to the wall-construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers in the first place to a method for putting a structural 
glazing on a wall-construction. In this method, panels made of glass or another 
material are put on a wall-construction. It is known for this purpose to make use of bolts or screws. This had the 
disadvantage that these are visible or difficult to handle in particular when the 
panel has to be exchanged. Also it is known to connect a panel to the wall-construction by applying 
mastic. This requires great care when fitting the panels. The panels must be 
correctly positioned with respect to eachother in orde not to upset the 
appearance of the wall. Furthermore the exchange of a panel is more 
troublesome since the old mastic layer has to be carefully removed from the 
wall-construction. The invention now intends to overcome these disadvantages and foresees 
the fitting of a mainly C-shaped profile on that side of the panel which, in fixed 
position, is adjacent to the wall-construction, optionally by glueing.
 
In this C-shaped profile is fitted an elastic element, the form of which principally 
corresponds the inner form of the C-shaped profile provide with cams, which 
grip to the inwardly pointing ends of the legs of the profile to form a seal 
element which on the one hand lies against the outer surface of the ends 
of the cams of the profile and which on the other hand will be adjacent to the 
wall-construction after fitting. The said elastic element is provided with a groove 
which lies in the perpendicular bissectral plane of the element and which is 
provided, near to the inner end, with an enlarged part.
 
The fixing of the panel on the wall-construction is done by pressing the panel 
together with the C-shaped profile, onto a tongue-shaped profile, which is 
extending from the wall-construction and which slots into the groove in the 
elastic element.
 
The tongue-shaped profile is provided with an enlarged part at the end that 
enters in the enlarged part of the groove. The panel, by the use of screws of 
which the central axes are parallel to the plane of the panel and which are 
fixed into parts of the wall-construction, can be adjusted in its plane and 
simultaneously can be secured with respect to the wall-construction by turning 
the screws in a groove fitted in that outwardly-facing, with respect to the panel, 
side-wall of the leg of the C-shaped profile. The panel can be provided with the C-shaped profile in the workshop.  
 
The connection can be made in particular by the use of mastic. After that, the

Method for putting a structural glazing on a wall-construction, 
characterised in that 


a mainly C-shaped profile is fitted on that side of panel 1 which, in fixed 
position, is adjacent to the wall-construction, optionally by glueing 
in the profile 2 is fitted an elastic element 6 the form of which principally 
corresponds to the inner form of the profile 2 and provided with cams 7 which 

grip the inwardly pointing ends 8 of the legs 9 of the profile 2 to form a seal 
element which on the one hand lies against the outer surface of the ends of 

the legs 9 and on the other hand will be adjacent to the wall-construction after 
glueing 
the said elastic element 6 is provided with a groove 10 lying in the 
perpendicular bissectral plane of the element and starts from the seal element 

and which groove is provided near the inner end with an enlarged part 
the fixing of the panel 1 on the wall-construction is done by pressing the 
panel together with the C-shaped profile onto a tongue-shaped profile 16 which 

is extending from the wall-construction and which slots into the groove 10 of 
the elastic element 6 
the tongue-shaped profile 16 is provided with an enlarged part at the end that 
enters the enlarged part 11 of the groove 10 
the panel 1, by the use of the screws 18 of which the central axes are 
parallel to the plane of the panel and which are fixed into parts of the 

wall-construction, can be adjusted in its plane and simultaneously can be 
secured with respect to the wall-construction by turning the screws in a groove 

29 fitted in that outwardly-facing, which respect to the panel 1, side wall of the 
leg of the C-shaped profile 2. 
Method according to claim 1 characterised in that space between the 
panels 1 is sealed by means of fitting to the side wall of the C-shaped 

profile 2, outside the region where the screws 18 are located, a sealing profile 
almost perpendicular to the side wall such that two adjacent sealing profile form 

a resilient connection. 
Method according to claims 1 or 2 characterised in that after glueing of 
the C-shaped profiles 2 to the panel 1, a pick-up element 20 wil be connected 

to an outwardly facing side-wall of a leg 9 of the C-shaped profile 2, which 
pick-up element 20 consists of a mainly C-shaped pick-up part 21 to which a 

 
part 22 of the sealing profile is fixed and which part 22 comprises an 

outwardly extended lip 24 and in which the C-shaped pick-up part 21 is 
provided with a leg 19 extending along the side-wall of the leg of the C-shaped 

profile and by which it is connected to it. 
Means for applying the method of claim 1 characterised in that it consists 
of 


a C-shaped profile 2 of which the side face of at least one of the legs 9 is 
provided with a groove 29 
an elastic element 6 of which the inner form of the C-shaped profile 2 and 
which comprises lips 7 able to clip onto the inwardly extended ends 8 of the 

legs 9 
a groove 10 lying in the central perpendicular plane of the element 6 and 
which starts from that part which grips the legs 9 of the profile 2 and which 

groove is provided with an enlarged part 11 at the inner end 
a tongue-profile 16 to be connected to the wall-construction, which is 
provided with an outer enlarged part 17 and which is adapted to the form of 

the groove 10, 11 in the elastic element 6. 
Means according to claim 4 characterised in that strips 12, pointing to the 
groove 10 can be axially applied in the elastic element 6, the longer edges of 

these strips 12 are situated under the enlarged part of the groove; the strips 
diverge from the enlarged part 11 of the groove 10. 
Means according to claims 4 and 5 characterised in that it comprises a 
pick-up element 20, consisting of a mainly C-shaped pick-up part 21, to pick 

up a seal profile 23 adapted to this seal profile 23 and a leg 19 connected to 
the C-shaped pick-up part 21.
