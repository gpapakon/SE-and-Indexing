<DESCRIPTION>
Attention is directed to copending application US-A-5 587 208 filed
concurrently herewith, entitled Radiation Induced Grafting of
Polyorganosiloxanes to Fluoroelastomers in the name of
Santokh S. Badesha et al.The present invention relates to a low surface energy material
particularly for use as a fuser member, a method of fusing toner images in
electrostatographic reproducing apparatus and a method for fabricating
the fuser member. In particular, it relates to a fuser member which may
preferably take the form of a fuser roll, pressure roll or release agent donor
roll.In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light
image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic
latent image upon a photosensitive member and the latent image is
subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic
thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner. The
visible toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily
disturbed or destroyed. The toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a
support which may be the photosensitive member itself or other support
sheet such as plain paper.The use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a
support member is well known. In order to fuse electroscopic toner
material onto a support surface permanently by heat, it is necessary to
elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the
constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky. This heating 
causes the toner to flow to some extent into the fibers or pores of the
support member. Thereafter, as the toner material cools, solidification of
the toner material causes the toner material to be firmly bonded to the
support.Typically, the thermoplastic resin particles are fused to the
substrate by heating to a temperature of between about 90°C to about
160°C or higher depending upon the softening range of the particular resin
used in the toner. It is undesirable, however, to raise the temperature of
the substrate substantially higher than about 200°C because of the
tendency of the substrate to discolor at such elevated temperatures,
particularly when the substrate is paper.Several approaches to thermal fusing of electroscopic toner
images have been described in the prior art. These methods include
providing the application of heat and pressure substantially concurrently by
various means: a roll pair maintained in pressure contact; or a belt member in
pressure contact with a roll; Heat may be applied by heating
one or both
