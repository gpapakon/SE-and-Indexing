<ABSTRACT>
A disk player has a magazine for storing disks and a disk 
transport mechanism transporting a selected disk between a playback 

position outside the magazine and a store position located entirely 
within the magazine. The carriages are stacked upon each other and 

pivotally supported within the magazine. The carriages are extracted 
from the stack by lifting a front end of a carriage above a selected 

carriage. A transport mechanism moves carriages between the magazine, 
the playback position and an eject position. A disk sensor senses the 

presence of a disk in the transport mechanism before the carriage is 
reinstalled in the magazine and a memory updated to indicate that the 

selected carriage is occupied by a disk. If an extra disk is inadvertently 
placed on the selected carriage, after the transport mechanism reinstalls 

the selected carriage, the sensor indicates that a disk remains on the 
transport mechanism. The transport mechanism then brings the extra 

disk to the eject position before moving the magazine to prevent the 
extra disk from being damaged by the movement of the magazine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for playing recorded
disks and specifically to such devices possessing the capability of storing
multiple such disks in a movable magazine and playing them selectively.
In particular, the present invention relates to a device which uses output
from a sensor, that detects the presence of disks in a playback position,
to prevent disk damage during movement of the magazine.The present applicant previously proposed a disk playback device
in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 5-71176. The device has an
internal magazine capable of moving up and down. The magazine
moves a selected disk, stored within, to and from a load position. The
device has a transport mechanism to further move disks between the
load position and a playback position. At all times, in this prior art
device, each disk is carried on and held by a respective carriage. Great
compactness is achieved with the basic layout of this playback device by
arranging the magazine so that a disk in the playback position partly
overlaps other disks within the magazine.The document EP 0 265 269 A discloses a method for operating
a disk player to eliminate jammed disks. When it is sensed
that a disk after completing playing has not been returned
to its magazine a mechanism trys to free the disk. If
this operation fails the player is disabled.A problem with this design occurs when disks are stacked on top
of each other in a single carriage. When this occurs, the top disk is left
behind in the tray because an edge of a mounting opening blocks the
upper disk when the carriage is moved from the playback position to
the magazine. The disk left behind could then be damaged when the
magazine is moved vertically because, as noted, the stored disks overlap
the disk in the playback position. It is an object of the present invention to provide a disk playback
mechanism that overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art device.It is another object of the present invention to provide a disk
playback mechanism, with a vertically moving magazine and with a
playback mechanism that permits a disk being played back to overlap
disks stored in the magazine, which is capable of operating with high
reliability.Briefly stated, there is described, a disk player having a magazine
for storing disks and a disk transport mechanism transporting a selected
disk between a playback position outside the magazine and a store
position located entirely within the magazine. The carriages are stacked
upon each other and pivotally supported within the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (1000) for playing back disks comprising:

means for storing (50) a plurality of disks (201);
said device having a playback position;
means for reading (200) a selected disk of said disks (201) at said playback
position;
means for transporting (309) said selected disk between said playback
position and a store position in said means for storing; and
said means for transporting having means for holding (591) at least said
selected disk;
said device being 
characterized by
:

   means for detecting (310) a presence of a further disk in addition to said
selected disk held by said means for holding (591).
The device as in claims 1, further comprising means for displaying an
error message, responsive to said means for detecting (310).
The device as in claim 1, wherein said means for detecting (310)
includes means for detecting said presence when said selected disk is in said

playback position.
The device as in claim 1 or 3, further comprising:

said device (1000) having an eject position whereat access is provided for
loading and unloading disks; and
means for transporting (309) said further disk to said eject position,
responsive to said means for detecting (310), whereby said further disk may be

removed.
The device as in claim 1, wherein said means for detecting (310) is
effective for detecting a disk in a range between said means for storing (50) and

said eject position including the playback position.
The device as in claim 1 further comprising:

   means for deflecting (21) said further disk at least partially from said
means for holding (591) as said means for holding is installed in said means for

storing.
The device as in one of the preceding claims, wherein said means for
detecting (310) is positioned to detect said further disk while said further disk

remains partially overlapping said means for holding.
The device as in one of the claims 4 to 7, further comprising:

   means for inhibiting a moving of said means for storing while said means
for holding is being transported to the eject position.
