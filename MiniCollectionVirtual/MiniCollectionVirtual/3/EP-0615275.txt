<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high-pressure sodium vapor discharge 
lamp the discharge space of which is enclosed by a ceramic vessel 
having hermetically sealed ceramic end members with electric 
feedthroughs connected with electrodes inside the discharge vessel 
and the discharge vessel contains sodium, noble gas and equal or less than 5 mg of mercury per 
cm3 of the volume of the discharge vessel and at least one further metal additive 
having a partial vapor pressure not exceeding 102 Pa at 1000 K. The operating characteristics of high-pressure sodium lamps are 
determined by the pressure and composition of the discharge 
produced in the lamp. As is known, the discharge in the high-pressure 
sodium lamps contains sodium, mercury and xenon, which 
have the following characteristic pressures in operation: 104,105 
and 3x104 Pa, respectively. The required vapor pressures of 
sodium and mercury are typically ensured by a sodium-mercury 
amalgam with a weight ratio of 1 to 3. The useful radiation is for the  
 
amalgam with a weight ratio of 1 to 3. The useful radiation is for the 
greatest part provided by the sodium and mercury has the role of 
increasing the voltage at the lamp terminals, thereby reducing lamp 
current and making current feedthroughs to be designed easier. One of the significant factors resulting in the market popularity of 
high-pressure sodium lamps is their long life limited by the voltage 
rise at lamp terminals during operation. The cause of this voltage 
rise is the reaction between the sodium content of the lamp and one 
or more components of the discharge vessel, due to which process 
sodium will be eliminated from the discharge. This effect is the so-called 
sodium loss that decreases the molar fraction of sodium in 
the sodium-mercury amalgam, which, in turn alters the sodium 
pressure in the discharge. At constant temperature, sodium loss reduces the pressure of 
sodium which is a minor problem in itself, however, at the same 
time mercury pressure increases, and with a greater slope than that 
of the increase of its molar fraction. This latter change will cause the 
voltage at lamp terminals to rise which will finally result in lamp 
extinction. The above facts are well-known to those proficient in the 
field. 
It is not surprising therefore that several attempts have been made 
to solve the above problem. The state-of-the-art methods are based 
on the presumption that the speed of the abovementioned sodium 
loss is to be slowed.  
 One of the approaches is aimed to reduce
