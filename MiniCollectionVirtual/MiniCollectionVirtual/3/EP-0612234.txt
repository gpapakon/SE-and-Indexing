<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to individually packaged absorbent articles, 
in particular individually packaged sanitary napkins. Sanitary napkins used to collect vaginal discharges are well 
known in the art. Individually packaged sanitary napkins are 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,973,567 issued to Srinivasan, et al. 
on August 10, 1976; U.S. Patent 4,917,675 issued to Taylor, et 
al. on April 17, 1990, European Patent Application Publication 
No. 0357000 A1 published in the name of Umesh on March 7, 1990, 
and in U.S. Patent 4,556,146 issued December 3, 1985, to Swanson 
et al. The Swanson, et al. patent discloses a trifolded wrapper 
which packages a sanitary napkin, covers adhesive on the 
outwardly oriented face of the backsheet, and may be used for 
disposing of the used sanitary napkin.  
 Other trifold arrangements are known, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent 
3,604,423 issued September 14, 1971 to Fraser and in International Publication WO 
89/02728 published April 6, 1989 in the name of Froidh et al. However, these latter 
two teachings suffer from the drawback that conveniently removable packages used 
in conjunction with a small individually packaged sanitary napkin is not taught. Discarding used sanitary napkins enveloped in the packaging is also taught in 
the art. For example, International Publication WO 89/02729 published April 6, 
1989 in the name of Pigneul and U.S. Patent 4,608,047 issued August 26, 1986 to 
Mattingly disclose two packaging arrangements suitable for this purpose. The search for improved individual package configurations for sanitary 
napkins has, however, continued. Accordingly, it is an object of an aspect of this invention to provide an 
individually packaged sanitary napkin. The individually packaged sanitary napkin 
should be easy for the user to open, and the packaging should protect exposed 
adhesive prior to the first use by the wearer. The packaging should preferably be 
usable for disposal of a used product, and closure mechanisms are preferably 
provided for maintaining the package in a closed configuration for disposal. According to the present invention there is provided an individually packaged 
absorbent article comprising an absorbent article having a body-facing side, a 
garment-facing side, two longitudinal and two lateral side margins, said absorbent 
article comprising a liquid pervious topsheet; a liquid impervious backsheet joined 
to said topsheet, said backsheet having opposed inwardly and outwardly oriented 
faces; an adhesive patch on said
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An individually packaged absorbent article comprising an absorbent article 
(20) having a body-facing side (20a), a garment-facing side (20b), two 

longitudinal (30) and two lateral (32) side margins, said absorbent article 
comprising a liquid pervious topsheet (22); a liquid impervious backsheet (24) 

joined to said topsheet, said backsheet having opposed inwardly and outwardly 
oriented faces; an adhesive patch (40a, 40b) on said outwardly oriented face 

of said backsheet; an absorbent core (26) positioned between said topsheet 
and said backsheet; a releasable wrapper (34) releasably affixed to the 

adhesive patch on said outwardly oriented face of said backsheet, said wrapper 
being folded about at least two transverse axes to define a package body (52a, 

51) and a package flap (52b); and a tape fastening system (59) for releasably 
securing said package flap to said package body in a folded arrangement 

wherein said package flap forms a first surface (34') and said package body 
forms a second surface (34''), said fastening system comprising: 


a tape (55) having a first end, a second end, an inner surface (61a) 
facing toward said first surface (34'), and an outer surface (61b) facing 

away from said first surface, said tape comprising 

a first portion (61) at the first end of said tape, said first 
portion comprising a relatively strong first adhesive (65) 

disposed on said inner surface (61a) for permanently affixing 
at least part of said first portion to said first surface (34'); and  

 
a second portion (63) at the second end of said tape, said 

second portion having a fastening member (63'') disposed 
thereon, said fastening member having an inner surface and an 

outer surface, said inner surface of said fastening member 
having a relatively strong second adhesive (67) thereon; 
 
characterized in that said tape fastening system also comprises a 

complementary landing member (57) having an inner surface (57a) 
comprising a third adhesive (69) that may be permanently affixed to 

said second surface (34''), and an outer releasable surface (57b) to 
which the inner surface of said fastening member (63'') is releasably 

affixed, wherein said second adhesive (67) on the inner surface of said 
fastening member (63'') would be sufficiently strong to form a 

permanent bond to said material comprising said second surface (34'') 
in the absence of said landing member (57). 
The individually packaged absorbent article of claim 1, further comprising a 
disposal flap (53) at one end of said releasable wrapper (34) for use in 

disposing a used absorbent article (20). 
The individually packaged absorbent article of claim 2, wherein said 
releasable wrapper (34) has an inwardly oriented face facing the outwardly 

oriented face of said backsheet (24), and an opposed outwardly oriented face, 
and said absorbent article (20) and releasable wrapper (34) are folded about  

 
two transverse axes which form said wrapper into a first, second, and third 

trisections (52a, 51, 52b), wherein said first trisection (52a) is folded over 

said second trisection (51) to form said package body and said third trisection 
(52b) is folded over said first trisection to form said package flap. 
The individually packaged absorbent article of claim 3, wherein said disposal 
flap (53) is located in said first trisection (52a) on the outwardly oriented face 

of said wrapper. 
The individually packaged absorbent article of claim 4, wherein said disposal 
flap (53) is located in said first trisection (52a) on the inwardly oriented face 

of said wrapper. 
The individually packaged absorbent article of claim 3, wherein said disposal 
flap is located in said third trisection (52b) on the inwardly oriented face of 

said wrapper. 
The individually packaged absorbent article of any preceding claim, wherein 
said first and second adhesives (65, 67) are the same adhesive. 
The individually packaged absorbent article of any preceding claim, wherein 
the inside surface near the end of the second portion (63) of said tape (55) is 

coated with adhesive and folded over on itself to form a folded end tab.  
 
The individually packaged absorbent article of any preceding claim, wherein 
the absorbent article (20) is a sanitary napkin.
