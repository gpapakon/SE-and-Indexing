<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid filter having a pot-shaped housing having the pot bottom situated underneath, a cover (42) which can be screwed on and at least one exchangeable annular filter insert (46) through which flow passes radially from the outside to the inside, in which by unscrewing the cover (42) on the pot bottom at least one outlet channel (45) which is closed at least in the oil filter out of operation is cleared, a liquid outlet on opening the cover is to be created in the simplest possible manner with respect to construction and function. This is achieved by the means for clearing the oil outlet orifice being a support piece (50) which is axially engaged in a force-transmitting manner with the cover (42) and lies in the liquid filter axis determined by the at least one filter insert (46), the end of which support piece (50) with the cover (42) closed projects into the outlet channel (45) and in this state closes it liquid-tightly and opens it when the cover (42) is open.

<CLAIMS>
Liquid filter (40) with a pot-shaped housing (41) with a 
pot base at the bottom, a screw lid (42) and at least one 

exchangeable annular filter insert (46) permeated from the 
exterior radially inwardly, in which at least one outlet duct 

(45) closed at least when the oil filter is out of operation 
is cleared by unscrewing the lid (42) on the pot base and in 

which the means for clearing this oil discharge orifice is a 
carrier part (50) which interlocks with the lid (42) so as to 

transmit axial forces, is located in the axis of the liquid 
filter determined by the filter insert (46), of which there is 

at least one, and of which the end penetrates into the outlet 
duct (45) when the lid (42) is closed and seals it tightly in 

this state and controls it when the lid (42) is opened. 
Liquid filter according to claim 1, characterised in that 
two filter inserts are provided, of which one is designed as a 

main flow filter element (46) made of paper and the other is a 
separately exchangeable secondary flow filter element (48) 

made of biased cotton stored in a part (52) connected to the 
carrier part (50). 
Liquid filter according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the carrier part (50) has an annular pot part (64) for holding 

the secondary flow filter element (48). 
Liquid filter according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the annular pot part (64) consists of two individual parts 

(55, 65) welded to one another. 
Liquid filter according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the individual part (65) forming the outer wall (66) of the 

annular pot part (64) has a coaxial sleeve-shaped extension 
(71) for holding the main flow filter element (46).  

 
Liquid filter according to claim 5, characterised in that 
annular recesses for holding ring seals (73, 74) are provided 

in the sleeve-shaped extension (71). 
Liquid filter according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the open end of the pot part (64) is closed by an annular lid 

(75). 
Liquid filter according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the lid (75) axially biases the secondary flow filter element 

(48). 
Liquid filter according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the carrier part (50) contains a central 

pipe (54) and a sleeve-shaped radially permeable extension 
(71) at least partially surrounding it with radial spacing, 

for receiving the filter element (46) of which there is at 
least one. 
Liquid filter with a pot-shaped housing with a pot base 
at the bottom according to claim 1, characterised by the 

features: 

(a) the annular filter element (46) rests radially tightly on 
the carrier part (50) at its axial ends in each case, 
(b) the carrier part (50) is designed as a radially permeable 
pipe (71) with a substantially identical external diameter in 

the region of the annular filter element (46) between its ends 
resting radially tightly thereon, 
(c) the regions of the carrier part (50) in which the ends of 
the annular filter element (46) rest radially tightly pass 

directly into the radially permeable pipe region (71) of the 
carrier part,  

 
(d) the pipe-shaped interior of the carrier part (50) located 
in the region of the annular filter element (46) is axially 

sealed in the region of the radially tight contact of the 
annular filter element (46) resting on the end of the carrier 

part (50) facing the screw lid (42), 
(e) this interior of the pipe-shaped region (71) of the 
carrier part (50) is axially open at the opposite end, 
(f) the radially permeable pipe region (71) of the carrier 
part (50) can be inserted radially externally tightly into the 

base of the pot-shaped filter housing (41), 
(g) for the permeation of the annular filter element (46) 
from the exterior radially inwardly, the pot-shaped housing 

(41) has an inlet for the liquid to be filtered which is 
connected to the space radially outside the filter element 

(46), 
(h) a discharge duct (44) for filtered liquid lies in the 
base of the pot-shaped housing (41) and is connected to the 

interior of the permeable pipe portion (71) of the carrier 
part (50).
