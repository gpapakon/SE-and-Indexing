<ABSTRACT>
Device for detecting road users who overshoot or undershoot prescribed speed limits. For taking still pictures, a radar-controlled television camera (3) is used whose individual pictures (images) are stored in a circulating storage (cyclic storage) (6) which is located in the external unit (1). The external unit (1) transmits a short message about the event to the central station (2) which then retrieves the image data from the external unit (1) and stores them finally in a mass storage device (10). At the time of the transmission of the short message, it is possible for the external unit (1) to switch on an alarm device (35) and/or for mobile police units to be alerted via police radio. The device can detect speeding, standstill of traffic and ghost drivers and initiate immediate measures without delay.
