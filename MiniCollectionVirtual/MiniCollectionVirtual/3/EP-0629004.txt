<ABSTRACT>
A surface covering material for the solar cell 
module, excellent in transparency, scratch resistance, 

weather resistance and flame retarding property, is 
obtained by covering the outermost surface with 

trifluorochloroethylene-vinyl copolymer, and employing 
a hard film 105 in the surface covering material under 

trifluorochloroethylene-vinyl copolymer. The hard 
film 105 and trifluorochloroethylene-vinyl copolymer 

106 are laminated and adhered with filler 104 to the 
photovoltaic element 103.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface 
covering for a solar cell module in which photovoltaic 
element having a photoactive semiconductor layer 
serving as the photoelectric converting member is 
protected with resin, and more particularly a solar 
cell module capable of showing excellent performance 
even under external ambience. Among the recent worldspread consciousness for 
the ecological issues, the deepest concern is directed 
to the warming of the earth by CO2 discharge, and the 
development and stable supply of clean energy are 
urgently wanted objectives. The solar cell is one of 
the most promising clean energy sources, because of 
its safety and ease of handling. The solar cell has 
been proposed in various forms, such as (1) 
monocrystalline silicon solar cell; (2) polycrystalline 
silicon solar cell; (3) amorphous silicon solar cell; 
(4) copper-indium selenide solar cell; and (5) compound 
semiconductor solar cell. Among these forms, the thin 
film crystalline silicon solar cell, compound 
semiconductor solar cell and amorphous silicon solar 
cell are recent targets of active developmental works  
 
as they are relatively inexpensive and can be formed 
into a large area. Even among these cells, the amorphous (non-monocrystalline) 
solar cell, prepared by depositing 
silicon on a conductive metal substrate and forming a 
transparent conductive layer thereon is considered 
promising as the future module, as it is light in 
weight, excellent in impact resistance and rich in 
flexibility. However, different from the case of 
silicon deposition onto a glass substrate, the surface 
at the light entrance side has to be coated with a 
transparent coating material in order to protect the 
solar cell. Glass or resinous material of high weather 
resistance, such as fluorinated resin, has been employed 
for such surface coating material. Fig. 3 shows an 
example of such solar cell module, in which provided 
are a layer 304 of glass or resin of of high weather 
resistance; a filler layer 303; a solar cell 302; and 
an insulating layer 301. The requirements for such 
coating material to be employed for surface protection 
of the solar cell module include high weather resistance, 
high moisture resistance and high protecting ability. In relation to the above-mentioned requirements 
for the coating material, the Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 4-76229 discloses, for a solar cell composed of a 
substrate and CdS/CdTe formed thereon, a protective  
 
film composed of a derivative of resin containing
