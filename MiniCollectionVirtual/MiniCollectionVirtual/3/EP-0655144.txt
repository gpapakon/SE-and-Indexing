<ABSTRACT>
A transparency intended for use in a high intensity light beam projector for stage lighting purposes, comprises a glass substrate (10) having selected areas (11) thereof coated with a multi-layer dielectric coating forming a dichroic colour filter. Selective coating is effected either by removing parts of an overall multi-layer coating through a mask, or by applying the multi-layer coating selectively through a mask.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to colour pattern projection apparatus for
projecting a colour pattern as part of a stage lighting scheme.It is already known in stage lighting systems to use a so called gobo,
which is effectively a partially transparent slide through which a light
beam is passed. With appropriate focusing arrangements, a sharp image
of the gobo can be formed on an illuminated subject. It is also known to
provide a mounting arrangement allowing a gobo to be rotated, so that
the image referred to rotates. Such prior art stage lighting systems
are known from EP 0 253 081 A1 or EP 0 248 974 A2.The present invention has for its object to provide an apparatus which
can be used to project a bright image in a coloured light beam and the
principle problem to be overcome in such an apparatus is the provision
of a transparency which can withstand the high temperatures existing in
the environment of a stage light projector.In accordance with the invention, there is provided a 
light beam projector according to claim 1.
Useful modifications are defined in claims 2 to 7.Preferably the transparency is mounted for rotation in the light beam.Furthermore the projector may comprise a colour changer so that light
passing through clear areas of the transparency is coloured by said colour
changer and light passing through the coated areas of the transparency
has a colour determined by the subtractive mixing effect of the colour
changer and the coated areas of the transparency.The transparency is preferably made by coating a dichroic filter with a
layer of metal selectively removing areas of the metal coating so that the
metal layer provides a mask and dry etching away the exposed dielectric
layers, for example by laser etching. The remainder of the metal layer is
then removed.Conveniently, the metal layer is selectively removed by acid etching
initially through a photographically formed etch resist mask formed over
the metal layer. The remainder of the metal layer is similarly removed
by acid etching after removal of the photo mask.Alternatively, the transparency may be manufactured by applying a mask
directly to the glass substrate and vacuum depositing the dielectric
material on to the substrate through the mask. With this arrangement a
series of masking and coating steps may be carried out so that different 
areas of the substrate have different filter properties and colour
transmitted light differently.In the accompanying drawings:
Figures 1 and 2 are diagrammatic sectional views illustrating the steps
involved

<CLAIMS>
A light beam projector for stage lighting purposes comprising

a light source (20);
an optical system (21, 22, 23, 24) for concentrating light from
said light source into a beam; and
an optically transparent glass substrate (10, 110) in said beam having
thereon a coating (11, 111) of dielectric material which acts as a

dichroic filter acting to reflect light selectively;
characterised in that
(a) said glass substrate (10, 110) has only selected areas thereof provided
with said coating so that only a part of the transmitted light beam is

coloured thereby; and
(b) said glass substrate is located relative to said optical system such that
a focused coloured image of said selected areas can be formed on a

distant surface.
A light beam projector as claimed in Claim 1, further

characterised in that
 a plurality of different areas (111, 113) of the
substrate are coated with differently formed layers of dielectric material

to provide a multi-colour effect.
A light beam projector as claimed in Claim 2, in which there
are two of such different areas which are shaped complementarily to one

another.
A light beam projector as claimed in Claim 1, in which
differently formed layers of dielectric material capable of transmitting 

differently coloured light are selectively formed on opposite sides of the
substrate.
A light beam projector as claimed in Claim 4, in which coated
area on opposite sides of the substrate are differently shaped.
A light beam projector as claimed in any preceding claim, in
which the substrate is mounted for rotation about the axis of the light

beam so as to cause rotation of said focused image.
A light beam projector as claimed in any preceding claim,
further comprising a colour changer (40) such that light passing through

clear areas of the substrate (10) is coloured by said colour changer and
light passing through the coated areas of the substrate has a colour

determined by the subtractive mixing effect of the colour changer and
the coated areas of the transparency.
