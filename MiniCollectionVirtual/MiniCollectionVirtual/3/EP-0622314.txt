<ABSTRACT>
The ball end (16) of the piston rod (14) of a linear motor 
(6) is mounted in a ball block (52). The block (52) has mating 

housing portions (54, 56) that abut along mating surfaces (64) 
that are substantially parallel to, but slope relative to, the 

motor axis (X). One housing portion includes an integral rear 
wall (70) through which the axis (X) extends and which defines 

a portion of a socket (58) that receives the ball end (16). 
The other housing portion has a flange (78) that projects into 

a space between the socket (58) and a sloping extension (74) 
of the wall (70). The outer surface (76) of the wall (70) is 

secured to a fixed support (84). The wall (70) transmits loads 
carried by operation of the motor (6) from the ball end (16) 

directly to the support (84) and minimizes loads on the 
fasteners (68) securing the housing portions (54, 56) together. 

The housing portion that includes the wall (70) is made from 
a material with a high load carrying capability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mountings and connections for 
linear motors and, more particularly, to a ball block that 
receives a ball end of a motor and has a rear wall through 
which the motor axis extends and which directly transmits loads 
created by operation of the motor from the ball end to a fixed 
support to which the wall is secured, and to a reinforcing bar 
that extends forwardly from the motor to attach it to a 
reciprocating floor member and reinforce the floor member. Linear motors of the type including a piston component and 
a cylinder component are used in a wide variety of 
installations. The motors may be powered hydraulically, 
pneumatically, electrically, or by other suitable means. In 
a typical installation, one of the piston and cylinder 
components is connected to a structure to be moved by the 
motor, and the other component is mounted to a fixed support. 
Since minor misalignments between the motor axis and the 
structure being moved are frequently difficult to avoid, it is 
sometimes desirable to mount the motor in a manner that allows 
some lateral movement to correct for minor misalignments. One 
way of accomplishing this is to provide the motor component 
which is to be mounted with a ball end and to mount the ball 
end in a socket formed by a ball block, which is in turn 
secured to a fixed support. In order to permit assembly of the 
ball end in the ball block, the block of necessity must be more 
than one piece, and the division between the pieces must extend 
through the socket. A problem that can arise from the division 
of the ball block into pieces is the load imposed on fasteners 
holding the ball block pieces together when the motor is 
operating. US-A-5,165,524 discloses a reciprocating floor conveyor 
having a ball block as defined in the preamble of claim 1. The present invention is directed toward improved mountings 
and connections for linear motors. An aspect of the invention  
 
is directed more specifically toward a ball block for mounting 
a ball end of a linear motor which has a piston component and 
a cylinder component. The ball end is formed on an outer end 
of one of these two components. The motor is operable to move 
the components relative to each other along an axis that 
extends through a center portion of the ball end. According 
to this aspect of the invention, the ball block comprises first 
and second mating housing portions that together define a 
socket for receiving the ball end. The housing portions abut 
each other along mating surfaces
