intermediate of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, being shown by the

following reaction scheme. The process is characterized in that formulation in
the first step is carried out in the two stages, that is, the reaction is carried out in

the presence of a tin catalyst at 60-85째C to a conversion of 30 to 80% and then
is completed at 95-105째C to produce a salicylaldehyde derivative (3) in a high

yield and a high selectivity. Thereby, the objective catechol derivative (1) can
be obtained in a high yield and with a high purity.


In the above formula, R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, alkoxy, halogen atom
, allyl, or aryl, and R
1
 is a hydroxy protective group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for preparing a catechol
derivative represented by a generic formula (1) mentioned later, which constitutes
a basic structure of a compound useful especially for pharmaceuticals and
agricultural chemicals and is used as an intermediate thereof.Monoalkylcatechol derivatives are used as intermediates for
pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. The method of preparing them by
alkyl-etherification of only a hydroxy group on one side of a corresponding
catechol derivative and the method of preparing them by hydroxylation of a
corresponding alkoxybenzene derivative have been mainly known. As to the
former, the alkyl-ether method by dialkyl sulfate (Japanese Patent Publication
(A) No. 112485/1993), and the alkyl-ether method by an alcohol and an acid
catalyst (Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 305546/1992) are illustrated. As
to the latter, the method by reaction with hydrogen peroxide under formic acid
(Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1989, 62, 1652-1657), the method by reaction with Fe
(IV)-EDTA ascorbic acids (J. Mol. Catal. 1982, 14, 333-340), the method by
reaction with peracetic acid (Nippon Kagaku Kaishi 1979, 370-374), and the
method of synthesis by photo oxidization under Lewis acid (Chem. Lett., 1972,
179-180) are illustrated.However, the above known methods are generally inferior in yield and
position-selectivity. Accordingly, a mixture of regioisomers is formed and it is
difficult to separate each other so that these methods are not suitable for 
preparing the intermediates of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals which
require high purity. Expensive reagents and raw materials which are difficult to
obtain, are sometimes used and therefore, these known methods are not satisfied
in the industrial production.The present inventors engaged extensively in solving the above
problems, and have found a new process for preparation of a catechol derivative
almost without any by-products and in a high yield and that in a high purity
almost without contamination of regioisomers.The present invention provides to a process for preparing a catechol
derivative represented by the following generic formula (1),

and is characterized in preparing the catechol derivative by the following three
steps:
(I) a step for preparing a salicylaldehyde derivative represented by the
following generic formula (3),

by reacting a phenol derivative represented by the following formula (2),
 
with a base and paraformaldehyde in the presence of SnCl2 and/or SnCl4 in an
organic solvent
