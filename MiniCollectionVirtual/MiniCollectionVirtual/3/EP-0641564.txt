<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent for 
thrombocytopenia and therapeutic agent for erythropenia, which 
contains a certain fused pyrazole compound, and to a specific, 
optically active fused pyrazole compound. Aided by the prominent development of chemotherapeutics, 
the treatment of infectious diseases has been showing a 
remarkable progress in recent years. At the same time, however, 
new problems with respect to opportunistic infectious diseases, 
on which previous chemotherapeutic agents fail to act 
effectively, and so on have emerged. Accordingly, a 
pharmaceutical agent which has a stimulating action on the 
depression of protection against infection is desired for 
treating these infectious diseases along with antibacterial 
drugs. While drug therapy and radiotherapy are thriving in the 
treatment of malignant tumor, their side effects are grave to 
the degree that continued treatment is difficult or patients 
lose volition to undergo treatments. In particular, 
myelosuppression (decrease in leukocyte count, platelet count 
and erythrocyte count) constitutes a major obstacle in the 
treatment of malignant tumor, and the resolution of such  
 
problems has been desired in view of the quality of life of 
patients. In the treatment of infectious diseases and malignant 
tumor, therefore, an integrated treatment, inclusive of a 
direct treatment of the disease and secondary treatments such 
as potentiation of preventive action against infection and 
alleviation of myelosuppression, is needed. Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, myelogenous 
anemia, congenital anemia, renal anemia, congenital and 
idiopathic neutropenia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 
are known as incurable diseases caused by myelosuppression. 
When effective, bone marrow transplantation etc. is done to 
cure these diseases caused by myelosuppression. However, there 
have appeared many problems such as limited supply of fresh 
bone marrow cells and possible induction of viral infection 
caused by the blood contaminated with various viruses. At present, human urine-derived colony stimulating factor 
(M-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 
Romurtide and so on have been developed for use for the 
treatment of diseases caused by the decrease in leukocyte count, 
which is a kind of myelosuppression. These drugs exhibit 
stronger accelerating effect on the recovery of leukocyte count 
than do conventionally employed glutathione preparations, 
whereas they may also increase the leukocyte
