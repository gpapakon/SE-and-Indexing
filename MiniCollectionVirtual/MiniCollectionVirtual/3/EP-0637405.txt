<ABSTRACT>
A device for generating optical signals is suitable in optical radiation shaping networks for micro-wave antennae, dispensing with the previously required costly circuits. The output currents from a linear arrangement of separate photodiodes are summed into a single electric transmission line. Implementation examples are disclosed.

Device for receiving optical signals modulated with 
frequencies 
>
 10 GHz with an unlimited number of 
inputs, using photodiodes to convert the optical 

signals fed in at the inputs into electrical signals 
and to sum the electrical signals, 
characterised in 
that
the photodiodes are comprised separate from one 
another in a linear arrangement and the output 

currents therefrom are summed into a single 
electric transmission line which is mounted as 

a base line on a ceramic material or printed 
circuit material, 
this transmission line has high impedance in 
the normal, no-load state ZU, 
the connections from the photodiodes to the 
transmission line feature short distances in 

relation to the micro-wavelength, and 
a coplanar hollow waveguide (CPW) together with 
PIN photodiodes with let-in substrates is used 

for the feeder structure. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the photodiodes are combined into a single monolithic 

array chip and mounted on a hybrid circuit. 
Device according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that in relation to the microwavelength 

the photodiodes are mounted on the chip in 
the form of discrete array elements packed tightly 

against one another in terms of surface density, the 
centre-to-centre distance between the photodiodes  

 
being greater than the diameter of the fibre buffer 

around the light guide (125 µm). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that arranged at the output of the 

transmission line which serves as the summation line 
is a transforming section, for example in the form of 

a λ/4 matching section with an impedance of √50
Z
L
 and 
a length of λ/4 or 1 mm in a system at 14 GHz. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a plurality of transmission 

lines are 
combined
 so as to sum all the module 
outputs to create an 
antenna pattern,
 the summation 
function being provided by arrangement of one or more 

co-phasal 
summation networks.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the HF phases of the incoming 

optical signals at the individual diodes can be 
adjusted so that the combined electron current only 

flows in one direction exclusively along the 
transmission line to the device's output. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by arranging co-phasal amplifier 

elements, for example of the Wilkinson type, to build 
bigger combination networks.
