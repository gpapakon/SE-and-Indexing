<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a plant in which expression of an 
endogenous gene has been reduced and wherein the genome of 

cells thereof is modified by incorporation of an additional 
DNA segment, transcripts of which segment are produced in 

the sense orientation and thus produced transcripts having 
a sequence complementary to said endogenous gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to plants produced 
by recombinant DNA methods for genetically altering plants, 
and more particularly, to improved means for altering plant 
phenotypes, such as color patterns and color intensity of 
flowers and other plant parts. Controlling metabolic pathways in plants has long 
been a goal of horticulturists. See, e.g., Bonner and Varner 
(1976) Plant Biochemistry, Academic Press, New York, which is 
incorporated herein by reference. The advent of recombinant 
DNA technology has provided new approaches to reaching that 
goal. While significant progress has been made in 
understanding gene regulation, control of plant gene 
regulation remains at a relatively early state of 
development. The water soluble pigment flavonoids are 
significant in their contribution to the coloration and other 
properties of higher plants. For example, the flavonoids are 
responsible for most orange, scarlet, crimson, mauve, violet 
and blue colors, and contribute significantly to yellow, 
ivory and cream colored flowers. See, Harborne, (1976) 
Chemistry and Biochemistry of Plant Pigments, 2d ed., Goodwin 
(Ed.) Acad. Press, London. The most important of the pigment 
molecules are the anthocyanins, particularly pelargonidin, 
cyanidin and delphinidin. These are the darker colored 
pigments responsible for the orange-red, magenta and mauve 
colors, respectively. The other major flavonoid types, the 
chalcones, isomeric flavanones, flavones and flavonols are 
light colored and tend to have relatively smaller effects on 
intensity or patterns of color.  The functions of these pigments extend well beyond 
coloration of flowers, however. The pigments also color 
fruits, leaves and other plant parts, and importantly provide 
plants with UV protection, as well as protection against 
herbivores and microbes. Other uses include allelopathy and 
even some pharmaceutical applications. The biosynthetic pathways of these various pigments 
have been extensively studied in many different plant 
species. The chalcones and aurones are products requiring 
only the initial biosynthetic enzymes, being direct products 
of the earliest precursors. The flavones and flavonols are 
intermediate, and the anthocyanins are products requiring 
substantial modifications from the initial precursors. All 
of these products are dependent upon the activity of the 
initial enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS), which catalyses the 
production of chalcone from three molecules of malonyl-Coenzyme 
A and one molecule of

A plant in which expression of an endogenous gene has 
been reduced thereby modifying a phenotypic trait, said 

plant having been produced by either: 

(a) a method comprising:- 
growing plants from a plant cell transformed with a 

polynucleotide comprising a DNA segment under operational 
control of a promoter, whereby said segment is transcribed 

in the cell in the sense orientation and wherein the 
transcribed DNA segment has a sequence complementary to 

mRNA encoded by said endogenous gene; and 
identifying a plant that exhibits a phenotypic change by 

screening the resulting plants for modification of the 
phenotypic trait; or 
(b) a method comprising:- 
transforming plant cells with a polynucleotide to produce 

transgenote cells, the polynucleotide comprising a promoter 
operably linked to a DNA segment such that transcripts of 

the segment are produced in the sense orientation in the 
transgenote cells, which segment transcripts have at least 

65% sequence identity to transcripts of said endogenous 
gene; 

growing plants from one or more of said transgenote cells, 
wherein production of mRNA encoded by the endogenous gene 

is reduced in one or more of the plants; and

trait.
