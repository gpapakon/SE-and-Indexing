<ABSTRACT>
In a drive arrangement for a rail vehicle, each driven wheel is coupled to a motor. The motors (2, 3) are either separately excited d.c. motors or three-phase asynchronous motors with a flat torque/rotation speed characteristic. In addition there are power converters (1, 11, 14), each of which powers at least two motors (2, 3) on one side of the rail vehicle. Each converter (1, 11, 14) is connected to a control unit (9) which on average receives the same reference moment Ms. The control units (9) are connected to detectors (15) of any differences in rotation speed between the motors (2, 3) connected to the relevant converter (1, 11, 14) and, when such differences occur between the motors (2, 3) the control unit (1, 11, 14) reduces the field. This arrangement reduces sudden changes in torque on the drive while passing over crossings or points or in curves, thus also reducing the load on the mechanical structure of the rail vehicle. in addition, the risk of slip and skidding is reduced.

Drive means for a railway vehicle, in which each 
driven wheel is coupled to a motor and current 

converters being provided, whereof each is connected 
to a control means and each control means receiving on 

the average the same allocation of torque, 
characterized in that each current converter (1, 11, 

14), which is an intermediate circuit voltage 
converter (1, 11, 14), feeds at least two motors (2, 

3) located on one side of the railway vehicle, these 
motors being either direct current motors with 

external excitation, or asynchronous motors for threephase 
current having a flat characteristic 

torque/revolution, and in that each control means (9) 
consists of a pursuit regulation system (10), a field 

oriented control (12), connected to a control set 
(13), constituting the impulses pattern for the dc-ac 

converter (14) of the current converter (1, 11, 14), a 
processor for the revolution speed (15) and a flux 

allocation means (15) allocating a target flux ψ
S
 to 
the field oriented control regulation (12), the 

pursuit regulation system (10) receiving the actual 
current value (i
SIW
) from the related motors and a 
corresponding target value (iSIW) from the field 

oriented control (12), that determines it by means of 
the preset torque value (M
S
) set by a travel control, 
and in that the motor revolution speed values (n1, n2) 

and the revolution speed values (
n
LR-1, 
n
LR-2) issuing 
from the two rotating wheels located on either side 

ahead of the driven wheels, are fed to the processor 
(15) of the revolution speed and in that the processor 

for the revolution speed (15) of the mobile wheels 
identifies the imminent revolution differences between 

the driven wheels, whereafter the field oriented 
control (12) receives a decreased flux target value 

ψ
S
, the decrease being dependent on the revolution 
difference.
