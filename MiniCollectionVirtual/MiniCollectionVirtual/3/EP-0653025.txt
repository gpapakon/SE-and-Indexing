<ABSTRACT>
The securing component which can be arc-welded to a structural component takes the form of a springy sleeve (1) and has a longitudinal slot (2). In a preferred embodiment, both frontal sides (3) are the same in order to simplify correct pre-positioning in the welding device, and have a thread-like internal drilling (4). The welding device for welding longitudinal securing devices has a feed channel and an axially movable holder for the securing devices. Instead of a slotted clamp, the axially movable holder (5) takes the form of a rigid tube in which the securing components formed as springy sleeves (1) are held. The arrangement for securing an assembly component to the securing component has an assembly component (21) which can be frictionally and positively fitted on the securing component. The assembly component (21) can have a shoulder (28) in its drilling (27) in order to engage behind retaining components (23) fitted on the outer wall of the securing component (20).
