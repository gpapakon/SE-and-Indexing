<ABSTRACT>
Compressed cocopeat elements can be used for 
soilless cultivation in the open-air or inside green-houses 

if they are directly supplied as substrate sheets 
in compressed form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for soilless 
cultivation in the open air or in greenhouses on 
substrate mats which are kept separate from the subsoil. 
It relates also to a growth mat for use in soilless 
cultivation. Substrate mats are used for the majority of 
tomatoes, cucumbers and paprikas which are cultivated in 
greenhouses. Also cut flowers, such as roses, gerberas and 
carnations are being cultivated to a greater extent on 
mats. Up to now, mineral wool, glass wool, polyurethane, 
wood-fibre and peat are mainly used as the raw material 
for substrate mats. WO-A-9001254 describes a substrate mat 
consisting of cocopeat sheets supplied in compressed 
form. The substrate mat is a lawn made of compressed 
coconut waste impregnated with selected seeds. The lawn 
is intented for laying lawns out on areas to be grassed. EP-A-0 476 828 describes a slab of growth 
substrate having a thickness between 50 and 150 mm. The 
slabs are individually packaged in flexible envelopes of 
plastic material. The compression ratio of the slab is 
not mentioned. This document describes the use of a straw 
bag having in the direction of the width of the slab a 
dimension of about 1,5-3 times the width of the slab. 
This increased size is not convenient for transport of 
goods. In order to solve this problem, the present 
invention proposes as packaging a gusseted bag of 
flexible plastic material. The gusset is particularly 
appropriated in the present case because it allows, 
without any cost, a considerable increase of the 
thickness of the growth mat until four times the initial  
 
thickness. The drawbacks of the straw slabs disclosed by 
EP-A-0 476 828 are the following : 
Voluminosity so that the transport cost are still 
high ; swelling in width and not in height ; limited swelling of about 50%. CH-A-409 already constitutes an artificial 
growth medium for the cultivation of plants. The medium 
consists of a coagulation of, on the one hand, particles 
of weak plastic which exhibit soil hydrology 
characteristics, and also contain air and nutrients, and 
on the other hand, particles of mineral origin. This synthetic substrate based on polyurethane 
foam or polystyrene foam and mineral wool and/or vermiculite, 
perlite, punch stone must be disposed of or recycled 
after the cultivation. Both are expensive. The use of an organic substrate such as peat 
has an adverse effect on the environment because it indirectly 
causes destruction of precious scenic areas. Peat sheets and wood-fibre mats have the disadvantage
