<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a disposable training pant having an improved elasticized side panel which gives improved fit and comfort. The disposable diaper has an absorbent core chassis (30) and a pair of elasticized side panels (50) connected to the longitudinal sides of the chassis, where each side panel is formed of two elasticized laminate members (10), joined by a side seam along a non-elasticized outboard edge (52) of each member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention related to disposable absorbent
articles, more particularly to disposable absorbent
diapers and incontinent products, and most particularly
to disposable training pants and pull-on diaper. The
invention is directed particularly to such articles and
products, especially training pants, which have an elasticized
side panel that provides the training pant with
improved fit and comfort. As used herein, "training pant"
includes also pull-on diapers comprising an absorbent
core.Training pants have become popular, especially for
use on toilet-training children. In the past some training
pants have been made elastically extensible using elastic
elements disposed in the training pants such that the
waist opening and leg openings are at least partially
encircled with elasticized bands. This method of using
elastic elements is shown in U.S. Patents 4,205,679 to
Repke, et al.; 4,610,680 to Laxer; 4,610,681 to Strohbeen,
et al.; 4,641,381 to Heran, et al.; 4,909,804 to
Douglas, Sr.; and 4,960,414 to Meyer.Another method of elasticizing disposable training
pants is shown in U.S. Patents 4,940,464; 4,938,753;
and 4,938,757 all of which issued to Van Gompel, et al.
These patents disclose a pant-like garment formed by
attaching discrete stretchable members to the side
edges of the main body of the garment. The discrete
stretchable members are described as being made by
stretching an elastic or stretchable layer to a selected
elongation, placing a nonstretchable layer, such as a
nonwoven, on the stretch layer, bonding the layers
together and allowing the layers to relax so that the
nonstretchable layer is gathered.Other methods for making a stretchable member is
Described in U.S. Patent 4,107,364, issued to Sisson on
August 15, 1978, U.S. Patent 4,209,563 issued to Sisson
on June 24, 1980, U.S. Patent 4,525,407 issued to
Ness on June 25, 1985. U.S. Patent 4,834,741 issued to
Sabee on may 30, 1989, European Patent Publication
409,315. The Procter & Gamble Company, published
January 23, 1991.Still other methods for making a stretchable member
is described in WO 92/15444, WO 92/15446 and
WO 92/15445, each filed February 28, 1991 and
assigned to The Procter & Gamble Company. These
references describe making an elasticized laminate by
mechanically stretching a zero-strain stretch laminate
web to impart the elasticity thereto in the direction of
stretching, at least up to the point of initial stretching. An
elongatable, non-elastic nonwoven layer is first bonded
to a liquid-impervious elastic layer while
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disposable training pant (1) comprising:

1) an absorbent chassis (30) having side edges
and a front waist area (40) and a back waist

area (41) comprising:

a liquid-pervious topsheet (33);
a liquid-impervious backsheet (32) and
an absorbent core (31) positioned between
said topsheet (33) and said badsheet

(32); and
2) an elasticised side panel attached to and
joining said front waist area (40) and said back

waist area (41) along each longitudinal side of
the absorbent chassis (30), said side panel

being laterally stretchable, comprising:

a front elasticised member (10) and a back
elasticised member (10), each comprising

a non-elasticised ouboc-od edge portion
(51) and an elasticised laminate portion

(15);
a side seam (50) joining said non-elasticised outboard
edge portions (51) of said front elasticised

member (10) and said back elasticised
member (10);

   
characterised in that

each elasticised member (10) is formed of a laminate material (20)
comprising at least one elongatable non-elastic non-woven layer (12) and at least one elastic layer

(13) wherein the elasticised laminate portion (15) is a portion of the
laminate material which has been elasticized by mechanically stretching the

laminate material to impart elasticity thereto in the direction of stretching, at least up
to the point of initial stretching and the non-elasticised edge portion (51) is a non-stretched portion of

the laminate material.
A disposable training pant (1) according to claim 1
wherein width of said outboard edge portion (51) is

from i-30 mm.
A disposable training pant (1) according to claim 2
wherein said width of said outboard edge portion

(51) is from 20-28 mm
A disposable training pant (1) according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said side seam (50) is

a pressure seal of the at least one elastic layer (13).
