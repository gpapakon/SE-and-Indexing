<ABSTRACT>
- Respiratory assistance tube (2), the distal end (3) of which is intended to be introduced into the trachea (4) of a patient and is provided with an inflatable balloon (5) for making a seal between the said respiratory assistance tube and the said trachea, and the proximal end of which is intended to be connected to means (7, 8) for feeding respiratory gas into the lungs of the patient, via the said tube. - According to the invention, the said respiratory assistance tube comprises at least one duct (10) passing through the wall of the said tube (2) and establishing communication (10) between the interior (9) of the said tube and the interior (6) of the said balloon (5), as well as a longitudinal duct (17) emerging in the cavity (6) and connecting the latter to the outside of the patient.

Tube for respiratory assistance (2), whose
distal end (3) is intended to be introduced into a

patient's trachea (4) and is equipped with an
inflatable balloon (5) to ensure leaktightness between

the said tube for respiratory assistance (2) and the
said trachea (4), and whose proximal end is intended to

be connected to an artificial respirator (7) for
conveying respiratory gas into the patient's lungs, by

way of the said tube for respiratory assistance (2),
which includes at least one first conduit (10) passing

through the wall of the said tube (2) and establishing
a communication between the internal conduit (9) of the

said tube (2) and the internal cavity (6) of the said
balloon (5), a second through-conduit (35) connecting

the internal cavity (6) of the said balloon (5) to that
part of the said internal conduit (9) of the said tube,

characterized in that it includes, in combination:

internal means of deflection (33, 34a) for at
least one jet of respiratory gas conveyed via at least

one first longitudinal conduit (31) formed within the
thickness of the said tube (2);
the said second through-conduit (35) being
situated between the said internal means of deflection

(33, 34a) and the distal end face (3a) of the said
tube; and
at least one second longitudinal conduit (17)
opening into the said cavity (6) of the said balloon

and intended to connect the said cavity (6) to the area
outside the said patient.
Tube for respiratory assistance according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the said second

longitudinal conduit (17) is connected to a pressure
sensor (15) which is able to control the functioning of

the said respirator (7).
Tube for respiratory assistance according to
one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the said

first and second through-conduits (10 and 35) are 
located in the vicinity of the most distal end (5a) of

the balloon (5), while the second longitudinal conduit
(17) opens out in the vicinity of the least distal end

(5b) of the said balloon (5).
Tube for respiratory assistance according to
any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it

includes a longitudinal capillary conduit (13) opening
out downstream of the said balloon (15) and connected

to a pressure sensor (11) able to stop the functioning
of the said respirator (7).
Tube for respiratory assistance according to
any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the

said inflatable balloon (5) is divided into two
cavities (6a and 6b), the said first through-conduit

(10) and the said second longitudinal conduit (17)
opening into one (6a) of these cavities, and a third

longitudinal conduit (22), formed within the thickness
of the said tube and able to be connected to a gas

source, opening into the other (6b) of these cavities.
Tube for respiratory assistance according to
Claim 5, characterized in that the said second through-conduit

(35), connecting the cavity (6) of the said
balloon (5) to that part of the said internal conduit

(9) of the said tube located between the said internal
means of deflection (33, 34a) and the distal end face

(3a) of the said tube (2), opens into the same cavity
(6a) as the said first through-conduit (10) and the

said second longitudinal conduit (17).
