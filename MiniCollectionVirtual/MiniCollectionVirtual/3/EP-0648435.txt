<ABSTRACT>
Smoking articles, cigarettes for example, having a 
tar delivery of not more than 6mg, a filter ventilation of 

at least 50% and a ventilation zone located not less than 
75% of the length of the filter from the mouth end thereof 

exhibit enhanced mainstream smoke water-to-tar ratios.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to smoking articles. Smokers of low tar delivery cigarettes have reported that 
the mainstream smoke therefrom is of a dry character. Methods for improving the taste of low delivery 
ventilated cigarettes are known, for example the patent DE 4 
118 815 discloses a triple filter for a cigarette wherein the 
triple filter comprises three sections, the central section of 
which has a central bore. The filter further comprises 
ventilation holes positioned upstream of the central section 
of the filter, such that the bore of the central section acts 
as a mixing chamber for the mixing of mainstream smoke and 
ventilation air prior to the smoke being inhaled by the 
smoker. It is an object of the subject invention to provide low 
tar delivery cigarettes which exhibit an enhanced mainstream 
smoke water-to-tar ratio. The subject invention provides a smoking article 
comprising a smoking material rod and a filter, the NFDPM 
delivery of the article being not more than about 6mg under 
standard machine smoking conditions, the filter being of a 
homogenous internal constitution, the filter being ventilated 
to at least a 50% ventilation value and the ventilation zone 
being located not less than 75% of the length of the filter 
from the mouth end thereof, whereby there is provided a 
smoking article which exhibits a mainstream smoke water-to-NFDPM 
ratio (x 100) of at least 6.  
 Preferably, the ventilation level is at least 60%. It is 
also preferable that the ventilation zone is located not less 
than about 80% of the length of the filter from the mouth end 
thereof. Advantageously, the ventilation zone is located at 
least 20mm from the mouth end of the filter and it may be 
located 24mm or more from the mouth end. Advantageously, the filter is a mono-filter and is of, 
substantially at least, homogeneous internal constitution 
throughout its length. It may comprise as filtration material 
fibrous cellulose acetate tow. When cigarettes are smoked at standard (ISO) machine 
smoking conditions, the smoking machine takes a 35cc puff of 2 
seconds duration in each minute. The degree of ventilation is 
taken to be the percentage of the 35cc puff volume which is 
constituted by ventilation air. As used herein the term "tar" means total particulate 
matter of the mainstream smoke less nicotine and water 
(NFDPM). It is measured according to a standard procedure at 
standard machine smoking conditions and with the use of a 
Cambridge filter pad. Preferably, the NFDPM delivery of 
smoking
