system includes a motor (112) having a stationary assembly and a 
rotatable assembly. The stationary assembly includes 

windings adapted to be commutated in at least one preselected

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to electronically
controlled motors; systems, such as refrigeration systems
having motors therein for driving compressors; and methods of
operating such systems.Refrigeration systems typically include motors for
driving compressors or other components which have several
shortcomings, including operating at a single speed.
Particularly, an original equipment manufacturer cannot
easily adapt a conventional motor to a number of different
applications. Each system uses a motor designed to operate
at a particular speed corresponding to that system rather
than providing for selecting among various speeds late in the
manufacture process. For this reason, it is difficult to
operate a particular motor in connection with a number of
refrigeration systems having compartments of various sizes or
walls of various thicknesses. Further, motors used in many
refrigeration systems are not capable of driving the system's
compressor at its maximum speed when the system requires
rapid cool down and/or operating at a speed selected for
maximum efficiency at all other times. Therefore, such
motors are ill-suited to increasing refrigerating capacity on
demand while providing improved thermal compression and heat
exchange efficiencies available at low speed operation for
the majority of operating time.Further, variable speed motors, such as many
electronically commutated motors, may be too costly for
application in typical refrigeration systems. The control
circuits for these electronically controlled motors support
various applications through the use of external integrated
circuits. External IC support, though, increases the parts 
count as well as the size of the printed circuit board which
results in greater cost for the compressor drive system.Electronically commutated motors are disclosed in
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,642,537 and 4,757,241, as well as in EP-A-0,572,149 which discloses a
control system for a motor of a heating and/or air conditioning system. The motor drives a
component, such as a fan, at a speed and torque responsive to a control signal generated by a
microprocessor. The microprocessor is in turn responsive to parameters representative of the
conditions prevailing in the system.Among the several objects of this invention may be
noted the provision of an improved refrigeration system
permitting optimum capacity for maximum cooldown and/or
efficiency; the provision of such a system which permits
operating the motor at one or more preset speeds; the
provision of such a system which
