<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an apparatus which is both land and roadworthy and which is for use in land management. The apparatus comprises wheel or drum members (2) on which it travels which members are provided with friction free or self-cleaning ridges (5) which when travelling over land provide an impression of a kind which safeguards against soil erosion and improves land irrigation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to land management and in particular to an 
apparatus for use in managing soil irrigation. EP-A-0373467, which discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1, describes the tyres of a 
trailing roller having an "arrow-shaped tread". 
Agricultural production techniques typically involve the ploughing, 
cultivating, harrowing, sewing, rolling, inversion, stirring and compacting of 
land. These activities are undertaken with the intention of obtaining 
maximum crop yield at minimum cost per acre of cultivatable land. 
However, such practices have created problems. These problems include 
soil surface erosion and difficulties in ensuring uniform soil irrigation. I have therefore produced a unique and relatively light weight means, 
compared to conventional agricultural equipment, for manipulating a loose 
bare soil surface. This means enables the profile and texture of the soil 
surface to be transformed so as to minimize against soil erosion and to 
provide for uniform soil surface irrigation. Further, the means is propelled 
using land management rollers that can travel either on agricultural land or 
road and when used on land these rollers have self-cleaning properties. 
In addition, the nature and number of said rollers can be modified 
according to a user's requirements. According to a first aspect of the invention there is therefore provided a 
land and roadworthy apparatus for use in land management comprising a 
driving means for moving the apparatus over land or along a road; and at 
least one wheel or drum member on which said apparatus, at least in part,  
 
travels, which member is adapted to be friction free or self-cleaning when 
travelling on said land and further includes a plurality of spaced peripheral 
ridge members; whereby movement of the apparatus over land creates a 
series of land impressions corresponding to the nature and number of 
ridge members of the apparatus for the purpose of preventing soil erosion 
and ensuring uniform irrigation. It therefore follows, that the ridge pattern on the said wheel or drum 
member will create a series of land impressions in the form of, preferably, 
equi-spaced land recesses, the result being that land thus treated will be 
fashioned in a manner which safeguards against erosion and further will 
be provided with a number of functional irrigation ditches so as to ensure 
that water (both rainfall and irrigation) retention across the land surface is 
substantially uniform. This latter advantage is essential where the

<CLAIMS>
A wheel or drum member (2) for use with a land and road worthy apparatus 
that is used in land management which wheel or drum member (2) is adapted to be 

self-cleaning when travelling over land, characterised in that; the wheel or drum 
member (2) includes a generally annular notched peripheral rim (4) including a 

plurality of spaced-apart peripheral ridge members (5) transversely-extending across substantially the 
entire width of said peripheral rim separated by relatively deep trough-like valleys also transversely-extending 

across substantially the entire width of said peripheral rim (4), said ridge members being sized and shaped 
so as to penetrate through the land and provide for a series of spaced-apart relatively 

deep irrigation pools (103), when the wheel or drum member (2) travels over land, 
whose size and shape and position correspond to the size and shape and directions of 

travel of said ridge members (5) on the periphery of said wheel or drum member (2). 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to claim 1 wherein said wheel or drum 
member (2) is provided with an outer resilient material which aids cleaning. 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to claim 2 wherein said material is 
rubber. 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to any proceeding claim wherein the 
number and nature of said ridges (5) are such that at least 50% of the land surface is 

impressed by same. 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to any proceeding claim wherein the 
sides of said ridge members are small relative to the size of conventional wheels on 

agricultural equipment whereby said wheels are substantially supported, on a level 
plane by the ground adjacent recesses created by said ridges. 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to any proceeding claim wherein the 
sides (5B) of said ridge members (5) are determined according to the nature of the 

land to be managed.  
 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to any proceeding claim wherein at 
least half of the surface area of the said wheel or drum member (2) is occupied by 

said ridges (5). 
A wheel or drum member (2) according to any proceeding claim wherein the 
spacings between said ridges (5) on said wheel or drum member (2) are equal. 
A land and road worthy apparatus that is used in land management comprising 
a drive means (1) for moving the apparatus over land or along road characterised in 

that it comprises at least one wheel or drum member (2) according to any preceding 
claim. 
An apparatus according to claim 9 wherein said wheel or drum member (2) is 
mounted on a single axle (1X) and the number and nature of the said wheel or drum 

members (2) is varied according to a user's requirements. 
An apparatus according to claims 9 or 10 wherein said wheel or drum member 
(2) is releasably mounted. 
An apparatus according to claims 9 to 11 wherein said wheel or drum member 
(2) is mounted so that spacing between adjacent wheel or drum members (2) can be 

varied. 
An apparatus according to claims 9 to 12 wherein said wheel or drum member 
(2) is mounted in pairs, each pair on a single axis (1Y). 
An apparatus according to claim 13 wherein said ridges in opposite wheel 
members (2) in a single pair are staggered with respect to each wheel so as to 

facilitate turning of the wheel members (2).
