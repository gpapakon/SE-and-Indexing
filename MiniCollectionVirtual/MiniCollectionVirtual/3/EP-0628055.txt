<ABSTRACT>
Modified TCF in which amino-acid residue(s) of the wild-type TCF responsible for glycosylation is (are) substituted or deleted so that at least one N-linked oligosaccharide chain is removed. The modified TCF have longer biological half-lives without loss of its biological activities. The modified TCFs are therapeutically important as agents for liver diseases or as anti-cancer drugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONMODIFIED TCF FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention is related to genetically engineered modified TCFs which contain different number of N-linked oligosaccharide chains compared with wild type TCF, and have new amino-acid sequences. These modified TCFs obtained in this invention have longer serum half-lives, have growth stimulating activities for hepatocytes and cy to toxic activities against tumor cells. Therefore, the modified TCFs are useful as therapeutic agents against liver diseases and as anti-cancer drugs.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTCF- 11, tumor cy to toxic factor derived form human fibroblast, is a novel anti -tumor protein which is different from any other proteins so far reported. The inventors succeeded in cDNA cloning of this protein, deduced its entire amino-acid sequence and confirmed the usefulness. This novel anti- tumor protein and its cDNA were disclosed in W090/10651. They were designated as TCF-II. In this invention, the glycoprotein which has the amino-acid sequence disclosed in W090/10651 is called TCF. TCF is a substance which has been called TCF-II.TCF has both strong cytotoxic activity against tumor cells and growth stimulating activity for normal cells. And it has been confirmed that TCF is a member of a family including HGF, a growth factor for hepatocytes. The molecular weight of TCF is 78000 ± 2000 daltons and/or 74000 ± 2000 daltons on SDS polyacryl amide gel electrophoreisis. Under reducing conditions, it showed a polypeptide band called A chain with a molecular mass of 52000 2000 

daltons and two polypeptide bands called B chain and/or C chain with molecular masses of 30000 ± 2000 daltons and/or 26000 ± 2000 daltons, respectively.Because TCF is a growth factor for hepatocytes, application to liver regeneration after hepatecto y has been examined. Since biological half-life of TCF is very short, attempts have been made to obtain more effective modified TCFs with prolonged biological half-lives.Relationship between oligosaccharide chains and serum half-lives has been investigated in some glycoproteins including erythropoietin. The investigations have demonstrated that glycoproteins with slightly different structure in oligosaccharide chains and with different biological activities can be synthesized from same gene. It was known that glycosylated erythropoietin is different in the biological activities from non-glycosylated one. However, about the relationship between oligosaccharide chains and biological activities of TCF little has been known.DISCLOSURE OF THE
