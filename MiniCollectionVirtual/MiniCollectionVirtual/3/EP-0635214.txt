<ABSTRACT>
A saleable meat product (e.g. a portion of poultry) is partially cooked 
at a first location, such as a processing plant, and is transported to a second 

location, which may be at a retail outlet, at which the product is subject to 
re-heating. For example, a portion of poultry may be cooked for a short period 

of time to ensure the elimination of bacteria, removed from an oven, and within 
a short period of time, whilst the poultry is still hot, may be bagged, sealed and 

cooled. The bagged meat product will then be delivered to a supermarket, and 
re-heated whilst within the bag, from which the product may be removed, or sold 

whilst retained within the sealed bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to saleable 
meat products. Meat products are conventionally delivered to a retail outlet such as 
a supermarket either in raw or cooked but cold condition, to be sold as such in 
the retail outlet. There is undoubtedly a consumer/purchaser desire for meat products 
in a hot condition, perceived as being freshly cooked. However, conventional 
health regulations prevent this from being effected conveniently and efficiently 
within a retail outlet premises. In particular health regulations require that a "cordon-sanitaire" be 
established between raw meat products and cooked meat products, and this is 
difficult to comply with where the raw meat products are to be cooked 
immediately prior to sale. One solution is to use an oven having an inlet, through 
which raw meat products are entered for cooking, the inlet being provided on one 
side of a partition, and an outlet from which cooked meat products may be taken 
from the oven, on the other side of the partition. However this requires a 
significant amount of constructional or building work to be carried out, to the 
disruption of the retail outlet. According to this invention there is provided a method of providing a 
hot meat product in a retail outlet, involving the steps: 
(a) at least partially cooking the meat product at a first location; (b) transporting said meat product to a second location spaced 
from the first location and (c) reheating said meat product at said second location. By the term "spaced from" as used herein we mean a distance greater 
than that over which food is conventionally transported between cooking stages, 
specifically greater than 10 metres, as will be involved when the two locations are  
 
in different areas of one building, probably greater than 100 metres, when 
different but possibly adjacent buildings will be utilised, but most likely greater 
than 1000 metres, when the two cooking stages are carried out at widely spaced 
locations. Thus where the second location is a supermarket store, the first 
location may be a meat processing factory. However if desired said first location 
may be at said retail outlet, being spaced from said second location by a cordon-sanitaire. Preferably however the meat product is completely cooked at said first 
location, the cordon-sanitaire being provided at said first location between the 
fresh meat products delivered to the cooking means, and the cooked meat 
products delivered thereby. Preferably the meat product is sealed in a

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a hot meat product in a retail outlet, involving 
the steps: 


a) at least partially cooking the meat product at a first location; 
b) transporting said meat product to a second location spaced 
from the first location; and 
c) re-heating said meat product at said second location. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the first location is a meat 
processing factory. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 and 2 wherein the second 
location is a supermarket store. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the first and second locations 
are at said retail outlet. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
meat product is completely cooked at said first location. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
meat produce is sealed in a covering subsequent to the step a). 
A method according to Claim 6 wherein the meat product is re-heated 
at said second location whilst in said sealed wrapping. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the meat product is subjected 
to an inc
omplete cooking operation at stage a), said cooking of the meat product 
being completed at the re-heating stage. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims involving the 
step of bagging the product whilst still hot. 
A method according to Claim 9 wherein the product is bagged whilst 
above a temperature of 7°C, preferably within 15 minutes of completion of said 

initial cooking operation, and preferably cooled to a temperature of (e.g.) 4°C or 
less subsequent to bagging.
