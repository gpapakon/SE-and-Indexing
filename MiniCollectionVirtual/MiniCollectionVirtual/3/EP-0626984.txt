<CLAIMS>
The use of water-soluble, optionally quaternized 
polyamidoamines with amide and amine components in the 

skeleton of an adduct of alkyldiamines, polyamines or 
polyalkyl polyamines with an ethylenically unsaturated 

carboxyl compound in circuit waters of wet separators for 

spray lacquering lines for the denaturing and coagulation 
of lacquers, waxes and/or organic coating compositions. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
carboxyl compound is selected from alkyl acrylate or 

methacrylate, acrylamide, acrylic acid and methacrylic 
acid. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the amines are selected from ethylenediamine, triethylenetetramine, 

tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, 
hexamethyleneheptamine, 1-aminoethyl piperazyl 

diethylenetriamine, 1-aminoethyl piperazyl triethylenetetramine, 
propylenediamine, dipropylenetriamine, butylenediamine, 

aminoethyl propylenediamine, polyethylene 
polyamine and polypropylene amines with an average 

molecular weight of 100 to 15,000. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that polyamidoamines corresponding to the 

following general formula: 

 
in which R is hydrogen or an alkyl group, more particularly 

methyl, m is an integer of 2 to 6, n is an integer of 1 to 
3 and x is a number of 10 to 500,
 
are used. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
linear polyamidoamines are used.  

 
The use claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
linear polyamidoamines with a weight average molecular 

weight of at least 500 and, more particularly, of at least 
1,000 are used. 
The use claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the 
weight average molecular weight of the polyamidoamines is 

in the range from 2,000 to 10,000. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the polyamidoamines are used in 

completely or partly quaternized form. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the polyamidoamines are used in the 

circuit waters in a quantity of 3 to 30% by weight, based 
on the quantity of lacquers, waxes and/or coating compositions. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the polyamidoamines are used in 

conjunction with typical lacquer coagulants. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the lacquer coagulants contain at 

least one of the following components a) to i) as active 
substances: 


a) 0.5 to 99% by weight of at least one inorganic layer 
silicate, preferably from the group of montmorillonites, 

bentonites, hectorites or kaolins, 
b) 0.5 to 99% by weight of at least one salt of calcium, 
magnesium, aluminium or iron, preferably in the form 

of the nitrate, chloride or sulfate, 
c) 5 to 20% by weight of at least one wax, preferably in 
the form of an aqueous dispersion, 
d) 2 to 25% by weight of at least one ethylene/acrylic 
acid copolymer which contains 8 to 25% by weight of 

acrylic acid units and 92 to 75% by weight of ethylene 
units, based on the acid form of the copolymer, and  

 
which is present as the salt of an inorganic or 

organic base, preferably in the form of a water-containing 
concentrate, 
e) 0.5 to 99% by weight of talcum, 
f) 0.5 to 99% by weight of aluminas, 
g) 0.5 to 5% by weight of at least one polyethyleneimine 
and/or protonated or alkylated derivatives of polyethyleneimine, 
h) water-soluble alkali metal and/or ammonium salts of 
molybdic acid and/or isopolymolybdic acid, preferably 

sodium molybdate, and 
i) polyelectrolytes based on quaternary methacrylates. 
The use claimed in claim 11, characterized in that the 
coagulants additionally contain at least one of the following 

components j) to l): 

j) at least one compound from the group consisting of 
cyanamide, dicyanodiamide or cyanamide salts, preferably 

dicyanodiamide or calcium cyanamide, 
k) at least one hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogen carbonate 
of the alkali or alkaline earth metals, 
l) active substances and/or auxiliaries typically encountered 
in lacquer coagulants, preferably biocides, 

pH regulators, corrosion inhibitors, antifoam agents 
or solubilizers. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the coagulants are made up in the 

form of powders, aqueous solutions or aqueous dispersions. 
A process for denaturing and coagulating lacquers, 
waxes and other organic coating compositions, characterized 

in that a polyamidoamine compound according to Claims 1 to 
13 is added to the circuit water of wet separators of spray 

painting lines.
