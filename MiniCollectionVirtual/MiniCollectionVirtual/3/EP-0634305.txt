<ABSTRACT>
A strap clasper for fastening a length of strap around a cargo on a 
freight deck of, for example, a truck or a freight car, which clasper 

includes a generally elongated buckle (1) having first and second end 
portions opposite to each other and also having a strap receiving mouth 

defined in the first end portion thereof. The elongated buckle includes 
a pair of spaced longitudinal side walls (10) and a bottom wall (11), a 

strap anchoring unit (3) including a retainer member (31) and an 
anchoring member (32) both mounted on the first end portion of the 

elongated buckle so as to straddle between the side walls for holding 
one of opposite end portions of a strap used to fasten a load, a strap 

winding unit (2) including a strap winding shaft (20) mounted on the 
second end portion of the elongated buckle so as to straddle between the 

side walls for winding the other of the opposite end portions of the 
strap (V). One end portion of the strap is anchored to the strap 

anchoring unit (3) by turning around the anchoring member so that 
respective portions of the strap between the retainer member (31) and 

the anchoring member (32) and between the anchoring member (32) and the 
bottom wall (11) of the buckle are firmly clamped. When the operating 

lever (21) is reciprocately pivoted while the end portion of the strap 
is anchored, the opposite end portion of the strap is wound up around 

the strap winding shaft. The strap clasper of the present invention is 
robust in that, even though the strap clasper is subject to severe 

vibration, the strap once fastened will not be unnecessarily be loosened, 
while allowing the length of the strap turned around the cargo to be 

adjusted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a strap clasper for fastening 
a length of strap or belt used to firmly secure a freight or cargo 
in position on a vehicle such as, for example, a truck, ship or 
freight car. In transporting a cargo from place to place by means of, for 
example, a truck, the cargo is firmly fastened to a freight deck of 
the truck while the strap is encircled around the cargo. A strap 
clasper is well known and has long been used as an instrument to 
firmly connect opposite ends of the strap together while a generally 
intermediate portion of the strap forms a loop around the cargo 
or, if one of the opposite ends of the strap is bound to a portion 
of the freight deck, to connect the other of the opposite ends of 
the strap with a different portion of the freight deck. The strap clasper is currently available in a number of 
designs, an example of which is disclosed in, for example, the 
Japanese Utility Model Publication (Jikkohei) No. 2-23885 published 
in 1990. The strap clasper disclosed in this publication comprises 
a generally elongated buckle including a pair of longitudinal side 
walls and a bottom wall integrating the longitudinal side walls together 
so as to render the elongated buckle to represent a generally 
U-shaped cross-section. The elongated buckle also includes an 
adjustable strap anchor mounted at one end of the elongated buckle 
for holding, for example, a first end portion of the strap and a 
strap winder mounted on the opposite end of the elongated buckle for  
 
winding a second end portion of the strap opposite to the first end 
portion thereof. In this prior art strap clasper, the adjustable strap anchor 
referred to above includes a first anchoring member around which 
the first end portion of the strap is turned so as to extend backwardly 
to allow the first end portion of the strap to overlap an 
inner portion of the strap adjacent the first end portion thereof 
thereby to define an overlapped anchor end of the strap, and a 
second anchoring member engageable with the overlapped anchor end 
to allow the overlapped anchor end to turn therearound, and a third 
anchoring member operable to increase the angle of turn of the 
overlapped anchor end of the strap. The prior art strap clasper of the design discussed above is 
used to fasten a cargo in the following manner. The first end portion 
of the strap is first turned around the first anchoring member 
until the first end portion of the strap comes to overlap the inner 
portion of the strap adjacent the
