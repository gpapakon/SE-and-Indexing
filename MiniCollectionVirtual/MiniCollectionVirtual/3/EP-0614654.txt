<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for coating a product (10) 
such as a medicament in the shape of a tablet. The apparatus includes a 

plurality of plates (50) for receiving and retaining the products and means 
for advancing the plates on a conveyor to various processing stations. At a 

dipping station, a dipping means lowers and raises at least one plate into 
a first coating tank (120) for coating at least a portion of the product. 

At a rotating station, a rotation means (70) rotates one of the plates 
containing the product for spreading the coating on the product. After 

rotation, a first elevator (302) transfers the plates from the conveyor (90) 
to a dryer (300) disposed above the conveyor. A second elevator (304) 

transfers the plates from the dryer back to the conveyor for further 
processing. The dryer includes complementary acting pusher bars (332) for 

transporting a plurality of plates horizontally along a plurality of 
vertically spaced guides. The plates are transported upward to traverse the 

guides through a first section of the dryer and downward through a second 
section of the dryer by the combined action of the first and second elevators 

and a mid-elevator (322). Several embodiments for the elevator are disclosed 
which include a lift bar mechanism (354), a continuous chain mechanism (376) 

and a lift rod system (400).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
forming a coating on a product and, more particularly, to 
an apparatus for forming a coating comprised of a 
gelatinous substance on a tablet. The present invention 
further relates to an apparatus for loading tablets 
into the coating apparatus for processing. The present invention is related to US-A-4,921,108; 
US-A-4,867,983; US-A-4,820,524; US-A-4,966,771; and 
EP-A-0,448,231. The present invention is also related to European Patent 
Applications EP-A-0611563, EP-A-0611032, EP-A-0607009 and 
EP-A-0607008, all filed concurrently herewith.  
 Many products, from prescription drugs to commonly available 
vitamin tablets to candy, are manufactured in a form which 
may be described as a "tablet." The primary function of a 
tablet is to provide a single dose or "serving" of the 
product in a manner which is convenient to manufacture, 
package and consume. As pointed out in my previous patents 
and applications, referenced above, it has been found that 
certain individuals suffer from physiological and 
psychological problems which impede their ability to swallow 
tablets. It has also been found that by providing tablets 
with a smooth coating, such as a coating comprised of gelatin 
or a gelatinous substance that the "swallowability" of a 
tablet is greatly enhanced. Such coatings and the general 
considerations involved in their application, such as 
preparation and drying time, are well known to those of 
ordinary skill. In addition to enhanced swallowability, there are numerous 
other reasons that it is desirable to provide a coating on a 
tablet. Such coatings protect the underlying product from 
deterioration and also serve to permit identifying colors or 
markings to be incorporated onto the design of the product, 
promoting product differentiation and brand identification. 
As pointed out in my previous patents and applications, it is 
also desirable in some instances to overlap two or more 
coatings to form a seam, thereby simulating the appearance of 
a hard gelatin capsule while providing a coated, solid (and 
thus tamper resistant) product.  
 Methods and apparatus for applying a gelatinous coating or 
other coating to a product which is in the form of a tablet 
are well known to those of ordinary skill. Such methods may 
include pan dipping or vacuum spraying of the coating 
material on to the tablet. Such methods are crude, however, 
producing uneven coatings which are generally unacceptable 
for commercial use. In an effort to improve the
