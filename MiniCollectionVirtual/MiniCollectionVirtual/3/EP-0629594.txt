<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of making shaped bodies of boron carbide, metal diboride and carbon, which is characterised in that   a) pulverulent boron carbide is homogeneously mixed with at least one pulverulent monocarbide of the elements Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta in an amount corresponding to from 2 to 6% by weight of free carbon, based on the total weight of the boron carbide, b) this mixture is shaped to give green bodies having a density of at least 50% TD, c) the preformed body thus obtained is heated with exclusion of oxygen in a sintering furnace to from about 1250 to 1450 DEG C and maintained in this temperature range for from 10 to 120 minutes and d) the preformed body is subsequently sintered by heating to from 2100 to 2200 DEG C.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing shaped bodies of boron 
carbide, metal diboride and carbon, characterized in that 


a) pulverulent boron carbide is homogeneously mixed 
with at least one pulverulent monocarbide of the 

elements Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta in an amount 
corresponding to from 2 to 6 % by weight of free 

carbon, based on the total weight of the boron 
carbide, 
b) this mixture is shaped into green bodies of a 
density of at least 50 % TD, 
c) the preformed body thus obtained is heated to from 
about 800 to 1500°C with exclusion of oxygen in a 

sintering furnace and maintained within this 
temperature range for from 10 to 120 minutes and 
d) the preformed body is subsequently sintered without 

pressure by heating to from 2100 to 2250°C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pulverulent boron carbide used has a specific 

surface area of from 5 to 50 m²/g. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the pulverulent monocarbide of the elements Ti, 

Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta used has a particle size of less than 
5 µm. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the shaped body is further 

densified by hot isostatic pressing subsequent to process 
step d).
