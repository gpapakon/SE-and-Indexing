<ABSTRACT>
Data to be communicated over a plurality of channels are divided into blocks 
(A1,B1,C1,D1,A2,B2,...), and each successive block is transmitted along a different 

channel (A,B,C,D) on a cyclic basis. A 5-to-6 bit coding scheme is used with some data 
values having one possible encoding, with three binary ones, and the remainder having two 

possible encodings, one with two binary ones and the other with four binary ones. To 
maintain d.c. balance on each channel, two-ones and four-ones encodings are used 

alternately for successive occurrences on a channel of any data value having dual 
encodings. To assist detection of single-bit errors affecting the encoded data, a delimiter 

having one of two possible values is sent after the final block on each channel; this 
delimiter value is chosen in accordance with which encoding would have been selected if 

another dual-encoding data value had occurred on that channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and systems for communicating data, and 
particularly, though not exclusively, to methods and systems for communicating data over 
a plurality of channels, such as a cable having a plurality of conductors (for example a 
four-wire telephone cable). The spread of personal computers and workstations has led to the development of 
networks for interconnecting such equipment and common resources such as printers and 
data storage devices. More powerful and sophisticated computing equipment and programs 
have progressively become available, allowing the processing of data in larger and larger 
quantities, for example in the form of database information and graphic images. These 
developments have in turn placed increasing demands on the speed and capacity of 
networks. Various new networking technologies have been proposed to cater for these 
demands. One such technology is the fibre distributed data interface (FDDI), which is 
based on the use of optical fibres and optical signals. However, practical experience has 
shown that although this technology can provide the required performance, it is relatively 
expensive, requiring the costly process of installing complete new networks of optical 
fibre, which is itself inherently expensive. Accordingly attention has also been directed to the possibility of transferring data 
at high speed over existing wiring installations, thereby avoiding the cost of installing a 
new network and gaining additional return for the expense previously incurred in installing 
the existing wiring. One possible technique along these lines involves the use of unshielded twisted-pair 
(UTP) telephone cables of the kind already used for lower-speed local-area networks. In 
this technique, described for example in US Patent 5 119 402, the required high data rate 
is achieved by transferring the data over multiple conductors, so that different portions of 
the data are transmitted simultaneously over respective conductors. In data communication systems it is desirable to ensure a high degree of error 
detection. One particular class of errors is those affecting individual, spaced bits. Such 
errors are known as single-bit errors. Various techniques have been developed for the 
detection of single-bit errors, including cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes and the 
encoding of data values using a limited number of valid code words. However, there 
remain certain combinations of single-bit errors which such techniques may not detect. It is an object of this
