<ABSTRACT>
A membrane electrochemical cell, in particular a fuel 
cell, of an improved type comprising a multiplicity of 

cell elements, each element made up of bipolar plates (1), 
current collectors (14), electrodes (7) and membranes (6), wherein the 

function of electric current transmission through the 
cell elements, the release of heat towards the outside 

environment, the distribution of electric current to the 
electrodes and membranes, the removal of heat from the 

electrodes and membranes and the distribution of the 
reactants and products are performed by distinct 

components, in particular bipolar plates (1) for the first two 
and porous electroconductive collectors (14) for the others. 

The bipolar plates may have flat surfaces without grooves 
and are preferably manufactured with aluminum, titanium or 

alloys thereof, through cheap mass productions techniques; 
the bipolar plates are used together with collectors 

provided with deformability, residual resiliency and high 
porosity. Said collectors advantageously act also as 

distributors of the gaseous reactants and of the products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The fuel cells fed with reactants containing hydrogen
and oxygen in the anodic (negative polarity) and cathodic
(positive polarity) compartments respectively, are
apparatuses characterized in that they produce electric
current with energy conversion efficiency referred to the
heating value of the fuel double or even triple with
respect to those typical of an internal combustion engine.
Further some fuel cells may also operate at relatively low
temperatures, indicatively in the range of 50-200°C, which
make them extremely useful for intermittent operations
such as those typical of both small on-site generation of
electric energy (for example as required by mechanical
workshops) and on-board power generation for
transportation means. These applications are also favoured
by the property of the fuel cells of being absolutely
noiseless, apart from the minor noise connected to the
operation of auxiliary apparatuses, such as fans and pumps
for the cooling circuit. Among the various low-temperature
fuel cells, particularly attractive for the above
mentioned purposes is the type based on the use of ion
exchange membranes, in particular perfluorinated sulphonic
membranes. The use of ion exchange membranes, which
substitute the conventional liquid electrolytes, permits
the construction of very simple fuel cells due to the
absence of the circulation, make-up systems, which are 
necessary with liquid electrolytes, as well as problems of
corrosion caused by the electrolytes themselves. Said
absence of electrolyte results in a wider choice of
materials possibly lighter and more economical. The use of
ion exchange membranes, which must be actually considered
as solid electrolytes, poses the problem of the nature of
the interface with the porous electrodes fed with hydrogen
and oxygen. In the case of the liquid electrolytes, due to
the capillary forces, they penetrate into the pores of the
porous electrodes thus forming a meniscus wherein the
triple contact between liquid, gas and catalyst of the
electrode occurs, as it is required for causing the
high-speed consumption of hydrogen and oxygen
respectively.
In the case of ion exchange membranes, the contact between
the membranes themselves and the porous electrodes is
necessarily influenced by the fact that the two components
are solid substances and therefore the area of triple
contact results limited to the areas of real physical
contact. Therefore the capillarity phenomena which
contribute in such a determinant way with the liquid
electrolytes are not possible. As a
