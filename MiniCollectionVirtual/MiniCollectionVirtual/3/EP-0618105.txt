<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport vehicle (1) having at least one hoisting appliance for putting on and taking off silos and/or containers, and having a chassis. At the rear of the chassis frame (3) there is mounted pivotably a tipping frame (4) which can be raised and lowered hydraulically. Guided movably in the longitudinal direction of the tipping frame (4) are container/silo receiving elements and a carriage for a hook pick-up, which can be driven by operating chain or cable pulls (7). The hook (9) of the hook pick-up (8) can be moved into positions for connecting with an upright container or silo. The aim of the invention is to make provision for the transportation of upright, in particular cubic containers or silos which are higher than the hook pick-up (8) in its operating position. For this purpose, the hook pick-up (8) is mounted pivotably directly on the hook carriage (6), which is guided displaceably in the tipping frame (4), and can be lowered into the tipping frame.

<CLAIMS>
Transport vehicle (1) with at least one lifting apparatus for the raising and
placing of silos and/or containers and a crossroad chassis with one or several

axes, with one at the rear (2) of the vehicle construction frame (3) pivotably
arranged and hydraulically raisable and lowerable tipping frame (4), which is

equipped with two longitudinal beams (5), along each of which container silo
pick-up elements (20, 21) and a hook-slide (6) - which are in drive-connection

with chain-driven hoists or cable winches (7) which are mounted at the tipping
frame (4) - are arranged in a traveling mode and with at least one

hydraulically pivotable, with the hook-slide (6) mechanically connected, with a
hook equipped (9) hook-lifter (8), which in the position to the connection of the

hook (9) or in other work-positions is movable with a container-/silo-eyelet,

characterized thereby
, that the hook-lifter (8) directly at the hook-slide (6),
which is movably arranged in the tipping frame (4), is pivotable in the

longitudinal direction of the tipping frame (4) around one pivoting axle (13)
which is vertical to the longitudinal beams (5) of the tipping frame (4) and

embeddable into the latter.
Transport vehicle in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized thereby
, that the
hook-lifter (8) in its non-embedded position - seen in the side view - has

essentially an L-shape, of which the shorter leg (10) has at the end (12) away
from the longer leg (11) the pivoting bearing (13) of the hook - slide (6)

arranged at the tipping frame (4), and that the shorter and the longer leg (10
and/or 11) of the L-shaped hook-lifter (8) are at their adjacent end-areas (18

and 19) connected by means of a pivoting bearing (17) in such a manner, that
the longer leg (11) is, by means of a pivoting cylinder (14), by 90° from the

end (12) located at the hook-slide (6) of the shorter leg (10) in alignment with
these and backwards pivotable and embeddable together with the lower leg

(10) into the tipping frame (4).
Transport vehicle in accordance with claim 2, 
chacterized thereby
, that the
two surfaces adjacent to each other (18, 19) of the shorter and with reference

thereto pivotable longer leg (10 and/or 11) of the L-shaped hook-lifter (8) run
below an angle (15) of 45° to the lower edge (16) of the shorter leg (1) and

that the area (18) forms an abutment-block for the surface (19) for the
limitation of a pivoting movement of the latter below an angle of 90° with

reference to the shorter leg (10). 
Transport vehicle in accordance with claims 1 to 3, 
characterized thereby
, that
the embeddable hook-slide (8) is fastened at a sliding arm of a hook-lifter.
Transport vehicle in accordance with one of the previous claims,

characterized thereby
, that the container-silo-lifting elements are formed by
lifting-segment pairs (20, 21) which can be inserted at any place into the chain

hoists or cable winches (7) mounted at the tipping frame (4).
