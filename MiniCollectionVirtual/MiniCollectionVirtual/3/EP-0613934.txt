<ABSTRACT>
When carrying out repairs, especially paint work on car bodies or the like, the body parts which are covered by rubber-like sealing lips on window panes or by door seals have to be incorporated into the painting. For this purpose, the sealing elements (7) either have to be removed or raised in such a manner that sufficient paint can be applied below the sealing elements (7). So that those parts which are not to be painted are covered and the body parts (8) beneath seals (7) and coverings are kept free for painting, the masking tapes (6) are provided with a stiff edge strip (5) with the aid of which the sealing elements (7c) are flanged at the edges and are fixed in this position by sticking the strip (6) on the part (9).

Masking tape made of paper or film which is 
intended for paint work in the region of sealing lips on 

motor vehicles and is provided on at least one side with 
an adhesive bonding layer (2), said masking tape being 

referred to as adhesive tape hereinbelow, characterized 
in that the adhesive tape (1, 6) is provided, at least 

along one of its edges (3), with a band-like, adhesive-free, 
flexible stiffening element (4, 5), of which the 

buckling strength is far greater than that of the adhesive 
tape (1, 6) and which permits the sealing lips to be 

bent up. 
Masking tape according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, as stiffening element (4, 5), use is made of a 

band-like strip (4, 5) made of plastic, such as 
polyester, which is connected non-releasably to the 

adhesive tape (1, 6) by adhesive bonding or welding. 
Masking tape according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the strip (5) is connected to the adhesive 

tape (6) in an overlapping manner such that at least 
a considerable amount of the width of said strip projects 

over the tape edge (3). 
Masking tape according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the bonding layer (2) is applied on the 

same side of the adhesive tape (1, 6) as the strip (4, 5) 
and is provided with a covering film. 
Masking tape according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the strip (4, 5) has a temperature 

resistance corresponding to the adhesive tape (1, 6), at 
least in the range up to 100°C. 
Masking tape according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized  
 

in that that side of the strip (4, 5) which is 
remote from the adhesive tape (1, 6), or at least that 

part of the strip which is free of the adhesive 
tape (1,6), is equipped with a smooth surface and, if 

appropriate, is provided with a non-stick layer and/or an 
anti-friction layer. 
Masking tape according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the thickness of the material of the 

adhesive tape (1, 6) is less than 200 µ, preferably 
approximately 120 µ, and the thickness of the material of 

the strip (4, 5) is less than 150 µ.
