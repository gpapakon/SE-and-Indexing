<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus that provides two different sources for generating the bytes 
to be inserted into frames of data being communicated through a switching unit. 

This apparatus allows for the insertion of variable, programmable data patterns in 
multiple frames. Under program control of a controller, the first source can 

selectively write data into designated time slots within designated rows and 
designated frames of multiple frames. Different data can be inserted into different 

rows of the same column of each frame. In addition, different data for different 
frames can be inserted into different rows of the same column. Also, the same data 

can be inserted into designated a row and column of a designated frame. The second 
source can write data into every row of a designated column of every frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
In broadband telecommunication networking, there are two emerging 
standards: synchronous optical network (SONET) and synchronous digital hierarchy 
(SDH). While SONET is the wideband data networking standard in the United 
States, SDH is accepted as the international wideband standard for the network node 
interface. Services based on these fast transmission standards will replace services 
based on current independently clocked plesiochronous networks. SDH defines the 
international standard for the network node interface, the point where existing 
plesiochronous signals are adapted to the synchronous hierarchy. SONET is its 
United States subset. Differences do exist between SONET and SDH; and in 
addition, both standards are evolving and adding new features. Within SDH, the 
basic module of data is the synchronous transport module (STM-1) frame. The 
STM-1 frame is the primary transmission unit of the SDH hierarchy and operates at 
a speed of 155.520 Mbps. Each STM-1 frame has 9 sets of timeslots with each set 
having 270 timeslots. Within a time slot interchange unit, a STM-1 frame is 
converted into a matrix of data bytes with each row being a set of timeslots and a 
column consisting of all occurrences of an individual timeslot in all rows. The 
resulting matrix has 9 rows and 270 columns. The STM-l frame consists of a 
section overhead, SOH, of approximately 5.184 Mbps and a payload of 150.336 
Mbps. The SOH of the STM-1 frame is reserve for SDH management, while the 
payload contains the information to be transmitted by customers. STM payloads carry information in the form of virtual containers, VCs, 
as defined by the CCITT recommendation G.709. Plesiochronous signals from 
conventional digital networks are adapted to the higher container byte rates by 
means of inserting (also referred to as stuffing) bytes. These inserting facilities are 
provided to adapt the plesiochronous signals to the synchronous network clock. 
Additional information called path overhead, POH, is added to the container to 
convert it into a VC. The POH contains information for control, supervision, and 
maintenance of the transmission network. To achieve the full flexibility of SDH, a switching system must be able 
to insert bytes into the STM-1 frames. Given the flexibility that is provided by SDH, 
it is not always possible to predict which bytes will need to be replaced for future 
uses of STM-1 frames. Further, the STM-1 frame provides spare channels whose 
use may well require the insertion of bytes in future
