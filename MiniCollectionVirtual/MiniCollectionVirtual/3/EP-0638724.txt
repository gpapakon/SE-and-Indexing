<ABSTRACT>
A vortex blower includes an induction motor (1) 
and a blower portion (2) driven by the motor. The blower 

portion comprises an impeller (4) and a casing (8). The 
impeller is so mounted on a rotary output shaft (3) of 

the induction motor that the impeller is disposed near 
the induction motor. The casing is so disposed that the 

impeller is interposed between the induction motor and 
the casing. An inlet port (10) and an outlet port (11) 

are provided on an end of the casing opposite to the 
induction motor. The blower portion has approximately 

the same diameter as that of the induction motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vortex blower for
blowing air. Such a vortex blower is e.g. disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 51-57011. A conventional
vortex blower comprises a motor portion and a blower
portion connected thereto. The blower portion includes an
impeller driven by the motor portion and a casing comprising
an annular groove interposed between the impeller and the
motor portion. The impeller and the casing define therebetween
an annular working chamber in which air is pressurized.In a vortex blower, it is necessary that an air inlet
means and an air outlet means are communicated with an annular
groove of the casing of the blower portion. Therefore, in
the conventional formation, the inlet means and the outlet
means radially extend outward, or extend along outside of the
motor. As a result, an outer diameter of the entire blower is
restricted by that of the casing which is larger than the
motor portion, and reducing the size of the blower is difficult.A vortex blower including the features of the first
part of claim 1 is known from GB-A-2 126 652. In Soviet Inventions
Illustrated (Section PQ, Week 8639, 9 October 1986,
Derwent Publications Ltd.) a compressor is described having a
casing in which an air inlet and an air outlet are provided
opposite to an impeller and said air inlet and said air outlet
extend axially outwardly.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
compact vortex blower layout. This object is met by a vortex blower according to
claim 1. Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the depending
claims.According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a vortex blower, which comprises a motor
having an output rotary shaft, a casing having an annular
groove, and an inlet means and an outlet means for working
medium, both communicated with said annular groove, and an
impeller having an annular groove in which a plurality of
blades or vanes are provided to extend radially to separate
the annular groove into a plurality of sections, the impeller
being interposed between the motor and the casing, and the
annular groove of the impeller being opposite to the annular
groove of the casing to cooperate with each other to define
therebetween a working chamber for the working medium, and
the impeller being directly connected to and driven by the
rotary shaft of the motor.Fig. 1 is a partially cross-sectional view showing a
first example of a vortex blower; Figs. 1A and 1B are cutaway cross-sectional views

<CLAIMS>
A vortex blower comprising:

a motor means (1, 50) having an output rotary shaft
(3);
a casing (8) having an annular groove (9), and an
inlet means (10) and an outlet means (11) for working medium,

both being communicated with said annular groove, respectively;
and
an impeller (4) having an annular groove (7) in which
a plurality of blades or vanes (5) are provided to extend

radially to partition said annular groove of said impeller
into a plurality of sections, said impeller being interposed

between said motor means and said casing, and said annular
groove of said impeller being opposite to said annular groove

of said casing to cooperate with each other to define therebetween
a working chamber for said working medium, and said

impeller being directly connected to and driven by said rotary
shaft of said motor means; wherein
said impeller (4) is connected to one end of said
rotary shaft at the outside of said motor means (1, 50), so

as to be disposed between said motor means (1, 50) and said
casing (8);

   
characterised
 in that

said motor means (1,50) is a totally-enclosed motor
having an enclosure from which both ends of said rotary shaft

(3) protrude;
said motor means (1,50) has a cooling fan (13) at the
other end of said output rotary shaft (3) outside of said

enclosure and has an end cover (14) for covering said cooling
fan (13) and for forming a flow of cooling air along the surface

of said totally-enclosed motor means (1, 50); and 
said casing (8) has an outer diameter equal to that
of said motor means (1, 50) and has an extended periphery

toward said motor means (1, 50), so as to guide said flow of
cooling air along the outer surface of said casing (8).
