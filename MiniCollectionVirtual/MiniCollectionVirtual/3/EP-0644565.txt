<ABSTRACT>
Unitary manipulator device for the wireless remote control of a functional unit, characterised in that it comprises a pivoting lever (1) which actuates an operating shaft (2) mounted with elastic return on either side of a mid position along a right-hand range of travel and a left-hand range of travel, each range of travel being divided into two successive ranges by a subdividing device (26), the said shaft (2) driving a displacement or position sensor of a transmission component (9) integral with the shaft operated by the lever (1). The invention applies to the field of wireless remote control.
