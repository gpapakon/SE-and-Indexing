<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-human mammalian embryonic 
stem cell wherein the neurotrophin-3 (hereinafter also referred to as NT-3) 
gene is inactivated, and a non-human mammal deficient in NT-3 expression. With the advance in developmental engineering technology and the 
rapid compilation of knowledge in molecular biology, it has become possible to 
artificially manipulate genes and introduce them to animal individuals 
[Gordon, J.W. et al., Proceedings of National Academy of Science, USA, Vol. 
77, pp. 7380-7384, (1980)]. Thanks to development of various methods of 
artificially adding exogenous gene essentially not conferred upon the 
organism of interest, or artificially suppressing expression of endogenous 
genetic characters essentially conferred upon the organism, a variety of 
transgenic animals have been generated and reported. Such transgenic animals are important in clarifying the functions of 
various cloned genes isolated by gene engineering and other technologies, 
since they enable research on an individual basis in the functional analysis of 
genes, regarding which information availability has been limited due to the 
fact that only cells cultured in vitro, such as cultured cells or primary cultured 
cells, have been available. Analysis of the physiological functions of cloned 
genes in vivo, and in particular experiments and studies using such 
transgenic animals as models of genetic diseases are actively being 
undertaken. Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) of a strain established from an inner 
cell mass of the blastocyst, or the fertilized embryo at the early stage, are 
capable of being grown and cultured with keeping in an undifferentiated 
state. These cells possess multipotency, by which they can differentiate into 
every kind of cell; when injected to a normal early stage embryo, they can 
participate in embryo formation to form a chimeric animal [Evans M.J. and 
Kaufman M.H., Nature, Vol. 292, p. 154 (1981)]. Making use of such nature, there have been attempts at creating 
various gene mutant animals. This trend dates back to 1981, when the ES 
cell line was established by Evans and Kaufman, followed by extensive  
 
research starting at the creation of an ES chimeric mouse by Bradley et al. 
[Nature, Vol. 309, p. 255 (1984)]. As successful achievements were reported, 
including homologous recombination in ES cells by Thomas and Capecchi 
[Cell, Vol. 51, p. 503 (1987)] and subsequent germ line transmission of ES 
cells by three research groups, including that of Holler
