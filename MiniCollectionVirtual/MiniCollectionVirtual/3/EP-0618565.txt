<ABSTRACT>
An interactive dynamic constraint speech recognition method and 
system. The method employs a speech pattern database (27) 

which is used to compile an updated grammar graph (32, 35). The 
grammar graph is constrained to the available word choices 

based on inputs from an external system application. The 
grammar graph used within the recognition processor (47) is 

dynamically recompiled to reflect the currently available 
vocabulary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to speech recognition 
techniques and in particular, to techniques for grammar 
constraints as a means of increasing speech recognition 
accuracy. Current speech recognition system accuracy is highly dependent 
upon the "perplexity" of the task, i.e., the number of possible 
word choices at any point in the speech string. These factors 
depend upon the total size of the active vocabulary (total 
choices) and the degree of "constraint" provided by the 
grammar/syntax. The more constrained the grammar, the fewer 
choices at each step of evaluating a sentence. Some 
applications require a very large vocabulary with a high degree 
of perplexity. For these applications, it is very difficult - 
if not impossible with current technology, to achieve extremely 
low error rates. In classic speech recognition systems, the designer attempts to 
manually constrain the system, to reduce perplexity/branching. 
For example, in a radiology task, a user would be required to 
speak a series of words which are used by the system to 
eliminate whole portions of the grammar model, e.g.; Human, 
Female, Chest, Lung, Tumor, Cancer. The goal is to eliminate 
75% of the possible choices after each word, such that only a 
very small portion of the grammar remains. At that point, the 
user may begin to speak full sentences. This manual constraint 
is necessary for two reasons. First, there is no a priori 
knowledge of what will be spoken in any instance in time, and 
second, grammar graphs must be compiled from descriptive files  
 
and installed upon the target machine - in other words, the 
grammar is static. Although, such manual constraints might produce acceptable 
results for non-real-time applications, like radiology, they 
are not acceptable for real-time applications, such as, Air 
Traffic Control (ATC), in which a spoken sentence must be 
recognized at once, without preparatory remarks. In such 
applications, the only option is to build a fairly 
unconstrained grammar in which, perhaps, hundreds or thousands 
of words are possible at each point in a sentence, as opposed 
to a more optimal four word choices. Such a low level of 
constraint coupled with use in a real-time, stressed filled, 
noisy environment, results in unacceptable error rates and 
response times. There are categories of applications, such as, air traffic 
control, in which aspects of the application can provide some 
level of a priori knowledge of the recognition system which can 
be used to constrain the

<CLAIMS>
A speech recognition system employing interactive dynamic 
grammar constraints comprising: 

a speech pattern database (27) containing a speech 
recognition vocabulary; 

a controller (17) interfacing with an external speech 
recognition application running in a real-time environment 

(10); 
a compiler (22) for generating an available grammar graph 

(32, 35) based on inputs from said external application; 
storage means for storing said compiled grammar graph in a 

memory location; 
a recognition processor (47) for analyzing a speech 

pattern received by said external application by 
comparison with the contents of said grammar graph and 

outputting a recognition result to said external 
application; 

wherein said grammar graph is updated by periodic 
recompilation based on real-time environment conditions of 

said external application to constrain the available 
vocabulary. 
The system of claim 1 wherein a single grammar graph (32 
or 35) is used in conjunction with the recognition 

processor. 
The system of claim 1 wherein two grammar graphs (32 and 
35) are sequentially updated and having a switch (40) to 

connect one or the other said grammar graph to the 
recognition processor (47), the contents of each of said 

grammar graphs being updated only when not connected to 
said recognition processor. 
The system of claim 1 wherein the compiler (22) expunges 
vocabulary no longer available for use by the external 

application. 
A method for dynamically constraining the vocabulary in a 
speech recognition system comprising the steps of: 

receiving input information regarding the available active 
vocabulary from an external application (10); 

compiling the input information with a speech pattern 
database (27) to obtain a grammar graph (32, 35) 

representing the active vocabulary; 
using said grammar graph in a recognition processor (47) 

to analyze speech; 
periodically updating said grammar graph based on the 

changing input information received from said external 

application to obtain a interactive dynamic constrained 
speech vocabulary for providing high accuracy speech 

recognition. 
The method of claim 5 further comprising: 
sequentially updating one or two grammar graphs (32, 35), 

the updating occurring only when said grammar graph is not 
connected to the recognition processor (47); and 

switching the connection between one grammar graph (e. g. 
32) and the other (e. g. 35) between recognition 

processing. 
The method of claim 5 including expunging inactive 
vocabulary from the grammar graph (32, 35) during 

compilation.
