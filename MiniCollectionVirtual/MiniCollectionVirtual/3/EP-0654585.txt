<ABSTRACT>
A steam turbine blade is provided in which the 
geometry of the blade airfoil is configured to reduce the 

weight of the blade while maintaining adequate thermodynamic 
performance. The blade has a high camber angle to 

increase its stiffness and an airfoil portion having 
pressure and suction surfaces. The curvature of the 

portion of the pressure surface between 25% and 75% blade 
height has a point of inflection in an area adjacent the 

leading edge so that the curvature switches sign. The 
curvature upstream of the point of inflection is concave, 

while the curvature downstream of the point of inflection 
is convex.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blades for a
steam turbine rotor. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a light weight blade for use in the
transition zone of a low pressure steam turbine that
substantially reduces the centrifugal stress on the blade
root and the rotor groove in which it is disposed.The steam flow path of a steam turbine is formed
by a stationary cylinder and a rotor. A large number of
stationary vanes are attached to the cylinder in a
circumferential array and extend inward into the steam flow
path. Similarly, a large number of rotating blades are
attached to the rotor in a circumferential array and extend
outward into the steam flow path. The stationary vanes and
rotating blades are arranged in alternating rows so that a
row of vanes and the immediately downstream row of blades
forms a stage. The vanes serve to direct the flow of steam
so that it enters the downstream row of blades at the
correct angle. The blade airfoils extract energy from the
steam, thereby developing the power necessary to drive the
rotor and the load attached to it. Such a type of steam turbine is disclosed for example in the document US-A-5 203 676.The amount of energy extracted by each row of
rotating blades depends on the size and shape of the blade
airfoils, as well as the quantity of blades in the row.
Thus, the shapes of the blade airfoils are an extremely
important factor in the thermodynamic performance of the
turbine and determining the geometry of the blade airfoils
is a vital portion of the turbine design. As the steam flows through the turbine its
pressure drops through each succeeding stage until the
desired discharge pressure is achieved. Thus, the steam
properties -- that is, temperature, pressure, velocity and
moisture content -- vary from row to row as the steam
expands through the flow path. Consequently, each blade
row employs blades having an airfoil shape that is optimized
for the steam conditions associated with that row.
However, within a given row the blade airfoil shapes are
identical, except in certain turbines in which the airfoil
shapes are varied among the blades within the row in order
to vary the resonant frequencies.Designing a steam turbine blade is made difficult
by the fact that the airfoil shape determines, in large
part, the mechanical strength of the blade and its resonant
frequencies, as well as the thermodynamic performance of
the blade. These considerations impose constraints on the
choice of blade airfoil shape so that, of necessity, the
optimum blade
