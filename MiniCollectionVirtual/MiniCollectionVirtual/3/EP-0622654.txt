<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an opto-electronic semiconductor device (1) for modulating a light beam fed to it, the opto-electronic semiconductor device having a pin structure (2, 3, 4). According to the invention, provision is made for arranging M semiconductor structures with a localisation of charge carriers in at least one dimension (Q1-Q20; CB1-CB10) in at least two groups (G1-G10), the semiconductor structures belonging to one group (G1-G10) having a localisation of charge carriers in at least one dimension (Q1-Q20; CB1-CB10) being separated by barriers (CB1-CB10) which essentially permit heavy-current conductor transitions between the individual semiconductor structures (Q1-Q20; CB1-CB10) of each group (G1-G10), and that the individual groups (G1-G10) of semiconductor structures (Q1-Q20; CB1-CB10) coupled in this manner are respectively separated by a further barrier (P1-P11) which essentially prevents heavy-current conductor transitions between the active layers (Q1-Q20) of the semiconductor structures (Q1-Q20; CB1-CB10) of one group (G1-G10) to an active layer (Q1-Q20) of another group.
