<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of preparing a molded 
body good in processing properties, having fine contiguous pores 

throughout it. The surface texture of the body is fine. The body is 
excellent in thermal conductivity and heat-resistance properties, can 

be readily prepared, and is usable as a transferring mold. 
The method comprises compounding and mixing 5-20 parts by weight 
of a binder consisting of a modified amine and a modified M. D. I. 

that are both liquid with 100 parts by weight of an aggregate 
consisting of aluminum powders or aluminum-based alloy powders, 

filling the mixture in a molding flask, and compressing it under a 
pressure per unit area of 20-80kg/cm², and maintaining it under the 

same pressure until the binder is hardened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing a molded body 
(mold and mold material) at a low cost, which body has air 
permeability throughout it, good thermal conductivity and heat 
resistance, and easy workability. Conventionally, forming molds having air permeability, and good 
thermal conductivity and heat-resistance, has been widely used to 
mold a thermoplastic plastic by the vacuum-forming method. The 
reason why the molds are required to have air permeability as stated 
above is that they are subjected to a vacuum suction. The reason why 
they are required to have thermal conductivity is that they 
themselves are heated in order to improve moldability, and that they 
themselves are cooled in order to quicken the release of the molded 
product from them. The reason why they are required to have heat 
resistance is that the their temperatures are increased in order to 
improve moldability and that when materials that have high molding 
temperatures or that are thick are molded, the heat of the material 
is transferred to the molds to increase their temperatures. Generally the following are known as the methods of preparing 
molds and mold materials: (1) a method of making pores for breathing 
after a metal material is molded, (2) a method of mixing metal 
powders with ceramic powders by means of an evaporable binder, 
forming a mold from the mixture, and then sintering the mold in an  
 
oxidative atmosphere to evaporate the binder to make the entire mold 
porous (Japanese Patent Early-publication No. 60-46213), (3) a method 
of mixing metal powders with a binder, forming a mold from the 
mixture, and oxidatively sintering the mold to oxidatively bind the 
metal powders and make the entire mold porous (Japanese Patent Early-publication 
No. 61-67703), and (4) a method of mixing aluminum 
powders with an urethane-based binder as a primary binder to form a 
material in a wet state, injecting a hardening gas as a catalyst into 
the material to form a primary hardened molded body while subjecting 
the material to pressure molding, impregnating the molded body with a 
thermosetting phenolic solution as a secondary binder, drying the 
impregnated body, curing (secondary hardening) the dried body to 
obtain a porous mold material, and then processing the cured body to 
form an air-permeable mold (Japanese Patent Early-publication No. 5-163506), 
etc. However, method (1) has such problems as wherein the traces of 
the processed pores are transferred to the molded workpiece, as well 
as wherein the

A method of preparing an air-permeable molded body characterized 
by compounding 5-20 parts by weight of a binder consisting of a 

modified diamine and a modified M. D. I. that are both liquid with 
100 parts by weight of an aggregate consisting of aluminum powders or 

aluminum-alloy powders having a grain size distribution of 325 to 48 
mesh, mixing the compound, filling a molding flask with the mixture, 

compressing the packed mixture under a pressure per unit area of 20-80kg/cm² 
and maintaining the mixture under the compressed state to 

harden the binder, and thereby obtaining a porous body having many 
fine and contiguous pores throughout it.
