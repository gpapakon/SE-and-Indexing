<ABSTRACT>
A lighting fixture (5) is fastened on a support section (1) using two metal clips (10) arranged at each end of the appliances. The clip is held on the lighting fixture by two lugs (8) hooked into hollow rings (20) of the lighting fixture section, and the clip is held in the bearing section by two lugs (7) of the clip which bear on either side on horizontal edges (19) of the open volume of the bearing section. The spring action of the clip bearing on the body of the lighting fixture holds the assembly correctly. Application: lighting tracks for humid or dusty atmospheres.

A lighting fixture holding device comprising a luminaire, a support 
profile, and a detachable elastic strip or pin which comprises two parts which are 

elastically interconnected and each support or constitute a hook, one said hook being 
designed to hook itself to a fastening element of the luminaire and the other hook 

designed to hook itself to a fastening element of the support profile, characterized in 
that said elastic strip comprises a portion which is folded back so that two strip portions 

are formed lying back to back, each of the hooks being supported by a respective one of 
these s
trip portions lying back to back, and the fastening element of the support profile 
is located substantially opposite the fastening element of the luminaire when the 

luminaire and the support profile are coupled, while the dimensions of the portions of 
the luminaire and of the support profile are such that they then provide a sufficient 

clearance for placing said folded-back portion between the portions of the luminaire and 
of the profile which support the fastening elements, so that said clearance is filled up 

and said portions are spaced apart from one another, while each of the hooks lies 
opposite the respective fastening element of the luminaire and the respective fastening 

element of the profile. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1 for a luminaire and a profile having a 
common plane of symmetry, characterized in that the elastic strip (or pin) is a 

symmetrical piece in U-shape which has two folded portions which are each situated in 
a leg of the U. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the folded 
portion is folded into a Z-shape such that the portions of the strip (or pin) which each 

form an extension of the two portions of the strip (or pin) which are situated back to 
back are turned in opposite directions. 
A device as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that it is provided with a 
portion of the strip (or pin) which forms an extension of one of the portions lying back 

to back and which is arranged so that it is accessible from the exterior of the profile 
and/or the luminaire.  

 
A device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the profile has a cross-section in the shape of an A, thus forming a closed volume and 

an open volume which are separated by a plane wall (corresponding to the cross-bar of 
the A), said plane wall is provided with an orifice, the luminaire is placed in position 

between the legs of the A in the open volume and has a hermetically closed body with a 
plane surface which lies opposite said plane wall of the profile, which plane surface is 

provided with an orifice opposite the orifice of the wall of the profile, a sealing gasket 
is placed around the orifices between the plane wall of the profile and the plane surface 

of the luminaire, and means for fixing the luminaire on the profile are dimensioned such 
that said gasket is compressed when the luminaire is in position. 
A device as claimed in the preceding Claim, characterized in that the 
profile supports on its inside an electrical connector in the region of said orifice, and 

the luminaire supports a corresponding connector such that the connectors are brought 
into connection with one another when the luminaire is in position in the profile. 
A device as claimed in the preceding Claim, characterized in that the 
profile and the luminaire are provided with guiding means for bringing the two 

connectors opposite one another when a luminaire is mounted on a profile.
