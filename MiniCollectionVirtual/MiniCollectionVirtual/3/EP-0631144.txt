<ABSTRACT>
A high-voltage differential sensor includes an attenuator formed of two 
matched monolithic capacitance divider networks (C1,C2). Each divider network is 

formed of a series connection of monolithically integrated capacitors (C1), which 
together generate an attenuated differential signal from a high-voltage differential input 

signal. The attenuated differential signal from the capacitance divider networks is then 
amplified and fed to a comparator (88), which generates a first output level when the 

high-voltage differential input signal is above a selected level, and generates a second 
output level when the high-voltage differential input signal is below the selected level. 

By using monolithically integrated capacitors in the divider networks of the attenuator, a 
simple, compact, low power, high performance high-voltage differential sensor is 

obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of voltage sensors, and relates more 
particularly to a high-voltage differential sensor which uses a input attenuator. High-voltage differential sensors are typically used in circuits such as 
high-voltage power supply circuits, where it is necessary to sense the voltage difference 
between two lines, each of which may have a high DC potential and an AC component. 
In the past, high-voltage differential sensor circuits have typically employed resistive 
dividers in order to scale down high input voltages to a level that can be safely handled 
by the voltage sensing circuitry. However, such resistive divider circuits suffer from a 
number of drawbacks. For example, if large-value resistors are used to minimize 
power dissipation in the dividers, a significant amount of silicon area must be used to 
implement the resistors. Alternatively, if smaller-value resistors are used to save space, 
significant amounts of power will be consumed by the resistive dividers due to the high 
voltages involved. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a high-voltage differential 
sensor circuit which would avoid the power consumption/area consumption tradeoff 
inherent in prior-art sensor circuits using resistive dividers. Additionally, it would be 
desirable to have a sensor circuit which is simple ad compact in construction, 
economical to manufacture, and capable of withstanding high input voltages without 
breakdown. It is thus a object of the invention to provide a high-voltage differential 
sensor which avoids the power consumption/space consumption tradeoff of prior-art 
circuits, which is simple and compact in design, ad which can accordingly be easily 
and economically fabricated. In accordance with the invention, these objects are achieved by a new 
high-voltage differential sensor which employs a attenuator having matched monolithic  
 
capacitive divider networks, with each network including a series connection of matched 
monolithically integrated capacitors for generating a attenuated differential signal from 
a high-voltage differential input signal. The differential sensor further includes an 
amplifier for amplifying the attenuated differential signal and a comparator for 
generating a first output level when the high-voltage differential input signal is above a 
selected level, and for generating a second output level when the high-voltage 
differential input signal is below the selected level. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each series connection of 
monoli
