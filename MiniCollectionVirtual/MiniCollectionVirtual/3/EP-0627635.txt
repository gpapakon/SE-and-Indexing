<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic diagnostic imaging system is provided for 
scanning with a linear transducer array and displaying an image area 

which is truncated with respect to a conventional triangular image 
sector to take the form of a trapezoid. Uniformity of image resolution 

and ease of signal processing enhancement is provided by 
transmitting adjacent ultrasonic beams at equal angular increments 

over the sector area. The ultrasonic beams transmitted are focused 
around predetermined transmit focal points and the transmit aperture 

employed for each transmission is determined by a transducer 
sensitivity criterion applied to the focal point. Means are provided for 

delaying signal components received from the beam directions so that 
the sum of the components will form a coherent echo signal. Means 

are provided for dynamically focusing received signal components by 
dynamically 

varying the sampling frequencies of laterally disposed signal 
components, and the receive aperture is dynamically varied in 

correspondence with the number of array elements which satisfy a 
sensitivity criterion at different depths of field.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ultrasonic imaging using a linear
transducer array and, in particular, to imaging through use of such a
transducer array over an imaging field comprising a trapezoidal sector.Ultrasonic imaging systems which perform sector scanning
utilizing a linear array are known in the art to comprise a linear array
of transducers which are successively activated at times delayed with
respect to individual transducers so as to transmit a radial scan beam
in a predetermined direction. The relative delay times of transducer
activation is successively varied so that the radial beam is angularly
steered across the sector scan field. Conventionally this sector scan
field has an origin point located on the surface of the transducer array
such that the near field is represented in a substantially triangular,
pointed format. Accordingly, near field breadth of view is limited by
this point source origin of the sector scan field at the surface of the
transducer.The prior art contains numerous approaches directed toward
improving the breadth of the scan in the near field. A simple
approach is to perform the scanning through a water-filled bag as a
stand off from the skin surface. The effect of this approach is to offset
the origin of the field from the surface of the skin, thereby effectively
truncating the triangular sector and creating a broader field of view at
the skin surface. However, image resolution at increasing depths is
compromised, as these depths are relatively more greatly removed
from the scanning transducer by the thickness of the water-filled bag.A second approach is to perform conventional linear array
scanning over the center of the sector by transmission of a plurality of 
beams normal to the surface of the array, and to scan a portion of a
fan-like sector field at each end of the array. This technique also
increases near field resolution without causing the deterioration in
depth of field resolution which is characteristic of the prior approach.A third approach is to activate the transducers of a successively
selected, laterally shifting group of transducers of a linear array such
that the transmitted beams form a sector scan field of which the origin
point is located behind the transducer array. This technique is
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,368,643 and offers an improvement in
simplification of the scan converter necessary to process the returned
echo signals for a visual display. The display format is simplified by
incrementing the angle of the radial scan beams in
