<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for manufacture of a 
thermographic or photothermographic element comprises 

the addition to the imaging composition of an amount 
sufficient to enhance the adhesive characteristics 

thereof of a polyalkoxysilane which has been pre-hydrolyzed 
in an organic solvent with a stoichiometric 

amount of water. A particularly suitable material is 
tetraethoxysilane which has been hydrolyzed in acetone 

with four moles of water for each mole of 
tetraethoxysilane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to imaging 
elements and in particular to the manufacture of 
thermally processable imaging elements. More 
specifically, this invention relates to an improved 
method for the manufacture of an imaging element 
comprising a thermographic or photothermographic layer 
which exhibits excellent adhesion characteristics. Thermally processable imaging elements, 
including films and papers, for producing images by 
thermal processing are well known. These elements 
include photothermographic elements in which an image 
is formed by imagewise exposure of the element to light 
followed by development by uniformly heating the 
element. These elements also include thermographic 
elements in which an image is formed by imagewise 
heating the element. Such elements are described in, 
for example, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 
17029 and U.S. Patents 3,080,254, 3,457,075 and 
3,933,508. An important feature of the aforesaid 
thermally processable imaging elements is a protective 
overcoat layer. To be fully acceptable, a protective 
overcoat layer for such imaging elements should: (a) 
provide resistance to deformation of the layers of the 
element during thermal processing, (b) prevent or 
reduce loss of volatile components in the element 
during thermal processing, (c) reduce or prevent 
transfer of essential imaging components from one or 
more of the layers of the element into the overcoat 
layer during manufacture of the element or during 
storage of the element prior to imaging and thermal  
 
processing, (d) enable satisfactory adhesion of the 
overcoat to a contiguous layer of the element, and (e) 
be free from cracking and undesired marking, such as 
abrasion marking, during manufacture, storage, and 
processing of the element. A particularly preferred overcoat for 
thermally processable imaging elements is an overcoat 
comprising poly(silicic acid) as described in U.S. 
Patent 4,741,992, issued May 3, 1988. Advantageously, 
water-soluble hydroxyl-containing monomers or polymers 
are incorporated in the overcoat layer together with 
the poly(silicic acid). The combination of 
poly (silicic acid) and a water-soluble hydroxyl-containing 
monomer or polymer that is compatible with 
the poly(silicic acid) is also useful in a backing 
layer on the side of the support opposite to the 
imaging layer as described in U.S. Patent 4,828,971, 
issued May 9, 1989. One of the most difficult problems involved 
in the manufacture of thermally processable imaging 
elements is that
