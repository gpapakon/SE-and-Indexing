<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides mice which are deficient in the normal expression of one or more members of the RAR or RXR class of receptors, to mice heterozygous for such deficiency, and to cell lines, preferably pluripotent or totipotent cell lines, which are heterozygous or homozygous for such deficiency. The present invention further provides the use of any of the above mice and cell lines in situations where the absence of at least one RAR or RXR receptors, or the normal expression thereof, is desirable.

<DESCRIPTION>
Genetically Engineered Mice Containing Alterations In The Genes Encoding Retinoic Acid Receptor ProteinsCross Reference to Related ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application 08/062,850, filed May 18, 1993, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.Field Of The InventionThe present invention relates to the fields of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) biology and transgenic mice. Specifically, the present invention relates to mice which are deficient in the normal expression of one or more of the genes encoding members of the RAR or RXR class of receptors, to mice heterozygous for such deficiency, to cell lines, preferably pluripotent or totipotent cell lines, which are heterozygous or homozygous for such deficiency, and to methods of using said mice or said cell lines to identify agonists and antagonists of specific members of the RAR or RXR class of receptors.Description Of The Related ArtIt has long been established that retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) are crucial for normal growth, vision, maintenance of numerous tissues, 

reproduction and overall survival (Wolbach, S.B., and Howe, P.R., J. Exp. Med. 42:753-777 (1925); for reviews and refs see Sporn et al., The retinoids, Nols. 1 and 2, Sporn et al, eds., Academic Press, Orlando, Florida (1984); Livrea and Packer, in Retinoids, Livrea and Packer, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York (1993)). In addition offspring of vitamin A deficient (VAD) dams exhibit a number of developmental defects, indicating that retinoids are also important during embryogenesis (Wilson, J.G., et al., Am. J. Anat. 92:189- 217 (1953)). With the exceptions of vision (Wald, 1968) and possibly of spermatogenesis in mammals (Thompson et al. , Proc. Royal Soc. 159:510-535 (1964); van Pelt, H.M.M. , and De Rooij, D.G. , Endocrinology 128:697-704(1991); and refs therein), most of the effects generated by VAD in fetuses, young, and adult animals can be prevented and/or reversed by retinoic acid (RA) administration (Wilson, J.G., et al, Am. J. Anat. 92:189-217 (1953); Thompson et al., Proc. Royal Soc. i59:510-535 (1964)). The dramatic teratogenic effects of maternal RA administration on mammalian embryos(Shenefelt, R.E., Teratology 5, 103-108 (1972); Lammer et al, N. Eng. J. Med. 573:837-841 (1985); Webster, W.S. et al, J. Cranofac. Genet. Dev. Biol 6:211-222 (1986); Kessel and Gruss, Cell 67:89-104 (1991); Kessel, M., Development 775:487-501 (1992); Creech Kraft, J., "Pharmacokinetics, placental transfer, and teratogenicity of

What is claimed is:
1. A transgenic mouse which has been genetically altered such that said mouse is deficient in the normal expression of one or more members of the RAR or RXR family of receptors.
2. The mouse of claim 1 wherein said mouse does not express detectable levels of a receptor selected from the group consisting of all isoforms of RARα, all isoforms of RAR7, RARαl, RAR72, RAR/32 and all isoforms of RXRα.
3. The mouse of claim 1 wherein said mouse does not express a functional receptor selected from the group consisting of all isoforms of RARα, all isoforms of RAR7, RARαl, RAR72, RAR 32, and all isoforms of RXRα.
4. A mouse not showing the deficiency as defined in any one of claims 1-3, but wherein said mouse is heterozygous or chimeric for said deficiency.
5. A transgenic mouse which has been genetically altered such that said mouse is heterozygous or homozygous for a deficiency in the normal expression of RXRα and RAR7 receptors or deficient in the expression of RXRα and RARα receptors.
6. A cell line which is heterozygous or homozygous for a deficiency in the normal expression of one or more members of the RAR or RXR family of receptors.
7. The cell line of claim 6 wherein said cell line does not express detectable levels of a receptor selected from the group consisting of all

11. The cell line of claim 6 wherein said cell line is a pluripotent cell line having the ATCC designation CRL11632.

13. The cell line of claim 12 wherein said cell line is a pluripotent cell line having the ATCC designation CRL 11632.
14. A method of identifying the subtype or isoform of RAR or RXR receptor bound by an agent, said method comprising the steps of:
(a) incubating said agent with one or more of the cell lines of claim 6; and
(b) determining the amount of agent bound by said cell line(s).
15. A method of identifying the subtype or isoform of RAR or RXR receptor bound by an agent, said method comprising the steps of:

(a) incubating said agent with one or more of the transgenic mice of claim 1; and
(b) determining the effect said agent has on the development of said transgenic mice.
17. A method of identifying an agent which is an antagonist or agonist of a subtype or specific isotype of RAR or RXR receptor, comprising the steps of:
(a) incubating said agent with one or more of the transgenic mice of claim 1; and
(b) determining the effect said agent has on the expression of a RA induced gene sequence.
18. The method of claim 15 wherein said mice have further been altered to contain a DNA sequence comprising a RARE or RXRE operably linked to a marker sequence.
