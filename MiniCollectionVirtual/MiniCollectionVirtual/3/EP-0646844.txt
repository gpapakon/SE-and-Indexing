<ABSTRACT>
Extra printing is made possible during a set of 
ordinary processing operations such as film development and 

printing. A film (F) is developed and dried while being fed by 
a leader attached thereto. After cutting the leader (L) from 

the film, it is fed to the printing unit to print the 
images on the film onto photographic paper. A plurality of 

film stocking units (Q) are provided in a path from the film 
drying unit to the printing unit (15). Each stocking unit (Q) can 

selectively stock a single film or leave it pass without 
stocking. The second film stocking unit (Q2) can move laterally 

to change the film track. If a film requiring a long 
exposure time is present in the printing unit, the 

subsequent films that have been developed and dried can be 
stocked in the other film stocking units. Thus, continuous 

film developing operations are not interrupted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic processing
machine for automatically developing and drying film,
printing images on films onto photographic paper, and
developing and drying the photographic paper, according to the
preamble of claim 1. Such a maschine is known from DE-A-41 10 642.As shown in Figs. 18 and 19, this type of
photographic processing machine has a film developing unit
A comprising a plurality of treating tanks, a film drying
unit B, a printing unit C, a printed paper developing unit
D having a plurality of treating tanks, and a printed paper
drying unit E. Films F are fed through the units A, B and
C. Web of photographic paper P is fed through the units C,
D and E. While feeding films and photographic paper, the
films are developed and dried and the images thereon are
printed onto the photographic paper. The thus printed
photographic paper is developed and dried. These steps are
all carried out automatically. In the device shown in Fig.
18, the film feed path G extending from the film drying
unit B to the printing unit C is located right over the
film drying unit B. In the device shown in Fig. 19, the
film feed path G extends straight ahead from the unit B.Films F are fed at different speeds and in different
manners in the film developing unit A and the film drying
unit B than in the printing unit C. Films are fed 
continuously fed in the units A and B, while in the unit C,
films are intermittently fed frame by frame. Thus, the
feed of each film has to be temporarily stopped before
feeding it from the unit B to the unit C. For this
purpose, a film storing unit Q is provided downstream of
the film drying unit B. Each developed and dried film is
stored temporarily in the film storing unit Q until the
printing of the preceding film F in the unit C is complete.Since such a film storing unit Q is used merely to
stop the feed of film temporarily, it can store only one
film. This arrangement poses a problem if it takes a long
time for the exposure of the film in the printing unit C.
More specifically, the time needed to expose each film in
the printing unit C varies according to its shooting
conditions. If a film in the printing unit C requires a
long exposure time, even though a second film F is being
stored in the film stocking unit Q, a third film that
follows the second film F may be guided into the unit Q.Since the developing time is fixed, it is impossible
to keep films in the developing/drying unit too long.
Thus, the third film has to be fed into the film storing
unit Q. Since the
