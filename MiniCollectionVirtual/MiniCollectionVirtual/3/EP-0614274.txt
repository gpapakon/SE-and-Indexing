<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oscillator, and, 
more particularly, to an oscillator which is formed in a 
DRAM having a self-refresh function. In general, an oscillator is used in a semiconductor 
integrated circuit to generate a periodic signal. Fig. 1 is 
a block diagram showing a conventional oscillator with the 
simplest structure. In Fig. 1, the oscillator is 
constituted of a CMOS inverter 22 whose output 102 is output 
to a terminal 51 and is fed back as an input 101 to the CMOS 
inverter 22. When the potential of the input 101 is equal to the 
potential of the supply voltage, the potential of the output 
102 changes to the ground potential and the potential of the 
input 101 changes to the ground potential accordingly. 
Then, the output 102 changes to the potential of the supply 
voltage. In this manner, the potential of the supply 
voltage and the ground potential periodically appear at the 
terminal 51, thus producing an oscillation signal. The 
oscillation frequency in this case depends on the supply 
voltage, the current driving power of a PMOS transistor and 
an NMOS transistor, which constitute the CMOS inverter 22, 
and a load or the like, which is connected to the output 
terminal 51 and is driven by the CMOS inverter 22. Such an oscillator is also used in a DRAM. If the 
oscillator is used in a DRAM having a self-refresh function, 
the dependency of the oscillation frequency on the supply 
voltage should be small. The self-refresh function of a 
DRAM is a function, which automatically executes the 
periodic refresh cycle in the DRAM without any need to 
change a signal input to the DRAM, once the DRAM enters a 
self-refresh mode. To perform this operation, the 
oscillation output signal accomplishes a counting function  
 
so that the refresh cycle starts every time a predetermined 
period elapses. Generally, as the supply voltage gets lower, the 
oscillation frequency of the oscillator becomes lower. 
Therefore, the refresh interval in self-refresh mode becomes 
longer as the supply voltage becomes lower. The refresh 
interval for the self-refresh mode should fall within a 
period during which a sufficient amount of charges to ensure 
the correct refreshing at a time of refreshing a certain 
memory cell again are held after this certain memory cell 
has been refreshed first and the other memory cells have 
sequentially been refreshed thereafter. This refresh 
interval should be set as longer as possible within that 
period in order to reduce the consumed current. If the
