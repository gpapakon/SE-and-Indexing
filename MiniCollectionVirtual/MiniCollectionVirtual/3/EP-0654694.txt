<ABSTRACT>
An interferometric modulator comprising a substrate of titanium-doped lithium 
niobate (Ti:LiNbO₃) having top and bottom surfaces and a waveguide formed in the 

top surface is disclosed. A conductive layer is formed on the bottom surface of the 
substrate and electrically coupled to a top-surface ground plane or simply to ground 

potential. The bottom surface conductive layer functions to thermally stabilize the 
modulator during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the field of electrooptic materials, and more 
particularly, to an optical waveguide device structure and method for reducing the 
effects of temperature in waveguide modulators made on ferroelectric crystals, such 
as lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO₃). Electrooptic waveguide modulators are commonly used in optical 
communication systems, signal processing, sensors, and the like. These modulators 
may be optical intensity modulators, switches, phase or frequency shifters, polarization 
transformers, wavelength filters, and the like. A class of these modulators are made 
of ferroelectric materials, such as z-cut lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) or lithium tantalate 
(LiTaO₃). An operational shortcoming of these modulators is temperature dependence. 
(The terms device and modulator will be used interchangeably.) Changes in temperature may be caused by a change in the ambient environment 
or, for example, a change in the temperature of the active region of the modulator 
caused by electrical dissipation of radio frequency drive power in the modulator's 
electrodes or substrate. Temperature changes may directly affect the modulator, or 
may affect it through changes in stress and the photoelastic effect. Changes in stress 
change the index of refraction of the material, and therefore the bias point phase and 
operation of the modulator. Additionally, in ferroelectric crystals pyroelectric (e.g., LiNbO₃), the index of 
refraction may be changed through the pyroelectric effect, which changes the internal 
electric field acting upon the modulator waveguides. However, devices based on modal interference between two single-mode 
waveguides, such as Mach-Zehnder type interferometers or directional couplers, are 
mainly sensitive only to changes of the differential index between two waveguides.  
 
Therefore, it is the symmetry of the device structure and the drive configuration that 
will greatly effect the manifested thermal sensitivity of the device (see "Sensitivity of 
RF Drive Power and the Temperature Stability of Mach-Zehnder Modulators," J.J. 
Veselka et al., Topical Meetings on Integrated Photonics Research, New Orleans, LA, 
April 13-16, 1992, paper TuG4, pp 200-201; and Skeath et al., "Novel Electrostatic 
Mechanism in the Thermal Instability of Z-Cut LiNbO₃ Interferometers," AppliedPhysics Lett. 49(19): 1221-1223). On z-cut LiNbO₃, the electric fields induced by the pyroelectric effect are 
predominantly in the direction perpendicular to the top surface
