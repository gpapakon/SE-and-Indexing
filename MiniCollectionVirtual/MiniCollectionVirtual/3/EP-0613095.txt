<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image processing 
generally and more particularly to pre-press processing of color 
images. Image processing techniques are described in Rosenfeld, 
A. and Kak, A., Digitalpictureprocessing, 2nd Ed., Vol. 1, 
Computer science and applied mathemetics series, W. Rheinboldt 
(Ed.), Academic Press, 1982, New York. Computerized graphic techniques are described in 
Folley, J.D. and Van-Dam, A. Fundamentalsofinteractivecomputer 
graphics, Systems Program Series, Addison-Wesley. Database systems are described in Date, C. J., An Introduction 
to Database Systems, Addison-Wesley, 1983, USA. The disclosures of all the above documents are 
incorporated herein by reference.  The present invention seeks to provide a method and 
system for color image processing in which the unit which is 
processed is not a raster unit such as a pixel but rather is an 
operand. Preferably, each operand is a meaningful entity with 
useful characteristics. Operands are typically not defined on a 
grid, unlike raster units. Instead, their locations and borders 
are preferably determined by the type of color processing 
operation which it is desired to perform or the type of color 
processing operation which it is believed might be performed in 
future. There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention a method for storing an image 
in an image processing database format including the steps of 
automatically defining a multiplicity of regions in the image, 
uniting individual ones of the regions in accordance with user 
input, thereby to define a plurality of image processing 
operands, and generating an image processing operand database by 
storing the locations of the image processing operands. Further in accordance with a preferred embodiment of 
the present invention, at least one of the following features is 
generally uniform within each of the multiplicity of regions: 
color, gray level, and texture. There is also provided, in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention, a method for storing an 
image in an image processing database format including the steps 
of defining a plurality of image processing operands in the 
image, determining at least one image processing feature of at 
least one of the image processing operands, and generating an 
image processing operand database including the locations and 
features of the image processing operands. Further in accordance with a preferred embodiment of 
the present invention, the step of
