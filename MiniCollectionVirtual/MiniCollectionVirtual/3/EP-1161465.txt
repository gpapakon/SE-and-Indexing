<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-stage process for the homo or copolymerization of olefin
monomers, comprising (I) a first polymerization stage in the presence of a Ti or V catalyst, thus
obtaining a polymer that has particular values of porosity; (II) a treatment stage wherein the Ti or V
catalyst is optionally deactivated and a late transition metal catalyst is supported on the porous polymer,
optionally in the presence of a suitable cocatalyst; and (III) a final polymerization stage, thus obtaining
new polymer compositions directly from the reactors.Early transition metal catalysts for olefin polymerization are well-known in the state of the art and
comprise the traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts based on Group 4 and 5 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC
notation) and the newer metallocene catalysts, based on Group 4-6 metals. These catalysts systems have
been widely used in single-stage processes for olefin polymerization, as well as in multi-stage
processes, the latter providing much greater flexibility in controlling the composition and the properties
of the end product compared to the former ones.Multi-stage processes are generally carried out by using the same catalyst in the various stages/reactors,
by utilizing tandem reactors operated in series: the product obtained in one reactor is discharged and
sent directly to the next stage/reactor, without altering the nature of the catalyst. For example, broad or
multi-modal molecular weight distribution (MWD) polyethylenes are commonly prepared by
employing a process, wherein ethylene is polymerized in various reactors containing the same catalyst
but in the presence of different concentrations of molecular weight regulators.Multi-stage processes are also used in the preparation of high-impact copolymers of propylene, by
sequential polymerization of propylene and of mixtures of propylene with ethylene. For instance, USP
4,521,566 describes the preparation of high impact strength polypropylene compositions in a multi-stage
process which comprises at least one stage of homopolymerization of propylene and at least one
stage of polymerization of ethylene/propylene mixtures in the presence, in both stages, of a catalyst
comprising a compound of titanium supported on a magnesium halide.The international patent application WO 96/02583 describes a multi-stage process wherein different
catalyst systems are used in the various stages, in order to allow the obtainment of a wide range of
olefinic polymer compositions. More specifically, while in the first
