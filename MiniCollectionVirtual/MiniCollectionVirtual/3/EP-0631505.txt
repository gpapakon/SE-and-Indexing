<ABSTRACT>
GLP-1(7-37), GLP-1(7-36)amide, and certain related compounds can be used to provide a medicament for use in the treatment of diabetes in a regimen which additionally comprises treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic agent. A strong synergistic effect is observed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of GLP-1(7-37) and/or GLP-1(7-36)amide for the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of diabetes in a regimen which additionally comprises treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic agent (sulfonylureas). The invention also relates to a method of treating diabetes by using said medicament.Diabetes is characterized by an impaired glucose metabolism manifesting itself among other things by an elevated blood glucose level in the diabetic patients. Underlying defects lead to a classification of diabetes into two major groups: type 1 diabetes, or insulin demanding diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which arises when patients lack β-cells producing insulin in their pancreatic glands, and type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which occurs in patients with an impaired β-cell function besides a range of other abnormalities.Type 1 diabetic patients are currently treated with insulin, while the majority of type 2 diabetic patients are treated either with agents that stimulate β-cell function or with agents that enhance the tissue sensitivity of the patients towards insulin.Among the agents applied for stimulation of the β-cell function, those acting on the ATP-dependent potassium channel of β-cells are most widely used in current therapy. The so-called sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide, glibenclamide, glipizide, and gliclazide are used extensively and other agents such as AG-EE 623 ZW also acting at this molecular site are under development (AG-EE 623 ZW is a company code for (S)-(+)-2-ethoxy-4-[2-[[3-methyl-1-[2-(1-piperidinyl)phenyl]butyl]-amino]-2-oxoethyl]benzoic acid, a compound described in European patent publication No. 147,850 (to Dr. Karl Thomae GmbH)). Among the agents applied to enhance tissue sensitivity towards insulin met-formin is a representative example.Even though sulfonylureas are widely used in the treatment of NIDDM this therapy is, in most instances, not satisfactory: In a large number of NIDDM patients sulfonylureas do not suffice to normalize blood sugar levels and the patients are, therefore, at high risk for acquiring diabetic complications. Also, many patients gradually lose the ability to respond to treatment with sulfonylureas and are thus gradually forced into insulin treatment. This shift of patients from oral hypoglycaemic agents to insulin therapy is usually ascribed to exhaustion of the β-cells in NIDDM patients.Over the years, numerous attempts have therefore been made to provide novel agents which stimulate

<CLAIMS>
Use of an effective amount of GLP-1 (7-37) or GLP-1(7-36) amide for the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in a regimen which additionally comprises treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic agent which is a sulfonylurea which is a blocker of the ATP-dependent potassium channel on β-cells, 
characterised in that
 the use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is in a type 2 diabetic patient with secondary failure to sulphonylurea treatment.
Use according to claim 1 when the oral hypoglycaemic agent is glibenclamide or glipizide.
