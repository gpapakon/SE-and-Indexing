<ABSTRACT>
The camera has a detector (2) with multiple sensing elements (C1,C2,C3), and an optical system (1) to form an image of the imaged space and project a part of that space onto each detector. A calibrator has an optical group (31) and a mechanical system to move the optical group to the calibration position. The optical group alters the focus, so that each detector sees the same scene, and thus receives the same infrared input level. Differences between the outputs of different detectors can thus be determined and compensated.

Optical calibration device for a thermal imager,
comprising a detector (2) having multiple elementary

sensors, and an optical system (1) defining an optical
axis (A'A), an entrance pupil (PE) and an exit pupil

(PS), in order to form an image of the observed space and
to project onto each sensor (C1, C2, C3) an elementary

portion of this space in a given direction (D1, D2, D3)
in imaging mode, characterized in that it includes an

optical combination composed of at least one simple lens
(LC) and placed, by tilting, in front of the imager

during a calibration operation and in that the focal
length and the position, measured along the optical axis

(A'A), of this combination are chosen respectively, on
the one hand, in order to observe, in calibration mode,

by means of each sensor, a field of view of the same
aperture (2
v
) as the field of view of the imager in
imaging mode and, on the other hand, to confer on these

fields the same mean direction (D1) by rejecting the
entrance pupil (PE) to infinity in order for the sensors

to see the same scene.
Optical calibration device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the optical calibration combination

is placed outside the imager and tilts by means of a
mechanical system (32).
Optical calibration device according to Claim 1
for a wide-angle thermal imager whose optical system

includes an adjustable iris (IR) as aperture diaphragm
placed between an upstream optical combination GI and a

downstream optical combination GII, characterized in that 
the entrance pupil (PE) in imaging mode lies in the plane

of the image focus of the calibration combination (31)
whose focal length (F) is given by


F = PE/2tan
v

PE being the diameter of the entrance pupil and 
v
 being
the aperture half-angle of the vertical field in imaging

mode.
Optical calibration device according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the optical calibration combination

(31) is composed of a simple lens (Lu, LC, L, L'), when the
entrance pupil (PE) lies inside the optical system (1) of

the imager, and comprises two lenses when the focal
length of the optical calibration combination (31) is

less than the distance between the entrance of the
optical system (1) and the entrance pupil (PE) in imaging

mode.
Optical calibration device according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the optical

calibration combination (L, L') is optically coupled to
an optical deviator (M, P, B) in order to restrict the

calibration to a working area (S) of the image.
Optical calibration device according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the optical deviator is a mirror

(M) retracted in imaging mode and placed on the optical
axis (AA') of the optical system (1) of the imager with

an inclination allowing the working area (S) to be
targeted.
Optical calibration device according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the optical deviator is a prism (P)

retracted in imaging mode and placed on the optical axis
(AA') between the said optical system (1) and the optical

calibration combination, the optical calibration combination
(L') being inclined in order to target the working

area (S).
Optical calibration device according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the optical deviator is a diasporometer

(B) composed of two prisms (B1, B2) and placed on
the optical axis (AA') between the said optical system

(1) and the optical calibration combination, the optical 
calibration combination (L') being inclined in order to

target the working area (S).
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the diasporometer (B) constitutes the device for

causing the deviation of the line of sight of the imager.
