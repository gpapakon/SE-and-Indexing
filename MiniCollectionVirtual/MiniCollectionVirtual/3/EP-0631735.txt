<ABSTRACT>
A wrist guard for protecting a wearer's wrist 
includes a first rigid plate member (30) and a second 

rigid plate member (32). The plate members are connected 
by a hinge (34) such that the first and second plate 

members pivot relative to each other about an axis 
generally parallel to a bending axis of the wrist. The 

hinge (34) accommodates substantially unrestricted 
downward pivotal movement and a substantially restricted 

upward pivotal movement of the plate members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to protective wear. 
More particularly, this invention pertains to a wrist 
guard to prevent injury to a wearer's arm, wrist and 
hand. A wide variety of protective gear is known for 
protecting sports enthusiasts from injury. Included 
within the wide variety is protective gear to protect 
the wrist and arm of a user. Examples of such are shown 
in U.S. Patents 4,400,829, 4,497,073 and 4,011,596. Recent years have seen a resurgence in the 
popularity of roller skating. Most notably in-line 
skating has developed into a popular recreational sport. During skating, from time to time, a skater may 
fall. Typically, the skater is skating on relatively 
hard surfaces such as asphalt, concrete or other 
pavement material. Naturally, when falling, a skater 
may extend his arm to break his fall. This can result 
in abrasion of the hand and arm. Also, when falling, 
the hand may be pushed backward relatively to the 
forearm to such an extent that the wrist is 
hyperextended resulting in strains or possible breakage 
of bone. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a wrist guard which minimizes hyperextension and 
which provides protection against abrasion. According to a preferred embodiment of the 
present invention, a wrist guard is provided for 
protecting a wearer's wrist. The wrist guard includes a 
first rigid plate member and a second rigid plate 
member. The first rigid plate member is secured to the  
 
back of the wearer's hand. The second plate member is 
secured to the wearer's forearm in close proximity to 
the wearer's wrist. The first and second rigid plate 
members are connected by hinge means permitting 
the plate members to pivot relative to each other about 
an axis generally parallel to a bending axis of the 
wrist. The hinge member accommodates a substantially 
unrestricted downward pivotal movement while providing a 
substantially restricted upward pivotal movement. 
Further preferred aspects of the invention include abrasion-resistant 
pads secured to the palm side of the bearer's 
hand. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, of which: 
Fig. 1 is a top view of the wrist guard of the 
present invention worn on a user's hand; Fig. 2 is a bottom view of the view of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a top plan view of the wrist guard of 
the present invention; Fig. 4 is a bottom plan view of the wrist 
guard; Fig. 5 is a top plan view of a spine member for 
use with the present invention; Fig.
