<ABSTRACT>
Device for supplying and monitoring an electric fence, including a means linked to an energy source (2) generating high-voltage pulses, a system for digitising an electrical quantity and a display device (14), and an alarm circuit (16). The digitising system includes a microprogrammed integrated electronic digitising circuit (12) which, by means of software, analyses the state of the fence line (3) and/or its level of insulation on the basis of data relating to the pulses sent into the fence line and/or data relating to the return pulses sent by a responder (5), sends the results of its analyses to the display device (14), and passes information to the alarm circuit (16) over a data transmission channel (17) including electrical insulation (18).

Device supplying power to and monitoring an electric 
fence intended to pen in livestock or to prevent int
rusions 
into an enclosure, comprising a means connected to a power 

source (2) generating high-voltage pulses, a system for 
digitizing an electric quantity and a display device (14) 

all drawing their electric operating energy from the high-voltage 
pulses generated by the means, and an alarm circuit 

(16) drawing its electric operating energy from the power 
source (2), the digitizing system comprising a 

microprogrammed electronic integrated digitizing circuit 
(12) which uses a software programme to analyze the status 

of the fence line (3), and/or its degree of insulation, 
from the data relating to the pulses transmitted along the 

fence line and/or data relating to the return pulses 
transmitted by a responder (5), sends the results of its 

analyses to the display device (14), and transmits 
information to the alarm circuit (16) via a data 

transmission channel (17) comprising an electric insulation 
(18), characterized in that when the pulse transmitted 

along the fence is of normal level, the alarm circuit (16) 
receives a pulse from the digitizing circuit (12), via the 

data transmission channel (17), whereas when the pulse 
transmitted along the fence is of an abnormally low level, 

the alarm circuit (16) does not receive any pulse. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the reception of a pulse by the alarm circuit (16) 

represents normal operation of the fence and/or of the 
device, whereas non-reception of a pulse represents, for 

the alarm circuit (16), abnormal operation of the fence 
and/or of the device and triggers an alarm to warn the user 

that the device is not operating properly.  
 
Device as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the data transmission channel (17) 

comprises a transmitter (25, 28) and a receiver (26, 29) 
spaced apart by a distance ensuring the electric insulation 

(18). 
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
said transmitter (25) and receiver (26) are infrared 

radiating optoelectronic components. 
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
said transmitter (25) and receiver (26) are components 

using ultrasonic waves. 
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
said transmitter (28) and receiver (29) are connected by an 

optical fiber (30). 
Device as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the data transmission channel (17) 

comprises a transformer whose primary winding receives the 
data from the digitizing circuit (12) and transmits them to 

the secondary winding connected to the alarm circuit (16). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the digitizing circuit (12) performs self-diagnosis.
