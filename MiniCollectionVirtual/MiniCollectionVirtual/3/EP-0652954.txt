<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel gene coding human epidermal growth factor ("hEGF") and a process for preparing the same employing a recombinant expression vector therefor. The hEGF gene of the invention is designed to contain codons ubiquitous in E. coli and the following restriction sites: HpaI at the 5' terminal, PstI at the 3' terminal and Bpu1102I, NsiI, MluI, Eco47III and AflII at a regular manner within its internal sequence. The present invention also provides a process for preparing REGF by employing an expression vector pTE105 for hEGF, which contains expression cassette comprising Omp A leader sequence, translation termination sequence and transcription termination sequence and hEGF gene; and, replication origin of pUC19, tetracycline-resistant marker and a par site for stabilization in E. coli. The hEGF is produced massively in E. coli transformed with the pTE105 (KCCM 10027).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing human epidermal growth factor employing a
recombinant expression vector therefor.It is known that human epidermal growth factor
(hereinafter referred to as 'hEGF') is a polypeptide
hormone consisting of 53 amino acids and 3 disulfide
bridges [see: Cohen, S., J. Biol. Chem., 237:1555-1562
(1962); Savage, C.R., Jr. et al, J. Biol. Chem., 248: 7669-7672
(1973); Savage, C.R., Jr. et al, J. Biol. Chem., 247:
7612-7621 (1972)]. hEGF plays an important role in growth
control in mammalian cells, inter alia epidermal and
epithelial cells, on a molecular level [see: Sporn, M.B. et
al, Nature (London), 313: 745-747 (1985); Sporn, M.B. et
al, N. Engl. J. Med., 303: 878-880 (1980)] and the
treatment of injury [see: Buckley, A. et al, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci., USA, 82: 7340-7344 (1985)]. Further, it has
been reported that hEGF can be applied in the treatment of
a stomach ulcer, owing to the fact that it represses
secretion of gastric acid into the stomach [see: Gregory,
H., J. Cell Sci. Suppl., 3: 11-17 (1985)].Under the circumstances, studies on the mass
production of hEGF has been actively carried out since
Starkey et al reported the biochemical properties of hEGF
purified from human urine [see: Starkey, R.H. et al,
Science, 189: 800 (1975); Cohen, S. et al, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci., USA, 72: 1317 (1975)]. Several researchers
have successfully accomplished cloning of the hEGF gene by 
recombinant DNA technology [see: Smith, J. et al, Nucleic
Acids Res., 10: 4467-4482 (1982); Urdea, M.S. et al, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 80: 7461-7465 (1983); Oka, T. et al,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 82: 7212-7216 (1985)]. The
prior art, however, had not provided hEGF at an
industrially useful level owing to its low activity and
productivity.Accordingly, studies on elevation of activity and
productivity in hEGF manufacture have been carried out,
which were primarily concentrated on the preparation of a
nucleotide sequence encoding hEGF efficient for its mass
production and of an expression vector whose regulatory
function is strengthened.In accordance with the present invention, the
inventors synthesized a novel hEGF gene and a novel
expression vector therefor which expresses hEFG in a
massive amount and developed a process for preparing hEGF
therefrom.The invention provides an expression vector for hEGF
comprising a par site for stabilization in E.coli; a
tetracycline resistance marker; and an expression cassette
consisting of an Omp A leader sequence, an hEGF coding
sequence,
