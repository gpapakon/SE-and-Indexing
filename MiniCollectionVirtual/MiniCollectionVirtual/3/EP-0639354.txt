<ABSTRACT>
A dental handpiece (10, 30) contains a tool (9) for 
dental treatment operation, tool holding members (13, 14, 33, 

114) for detachably and rotatably holding the tool (9), tool 
detachment members (22, 32) for abutting against the tool 

holding members (13, 14, 33, 114) to detach the tool (9) from 
the tool holding members (13, 14, 33, 114), and rotatable 

contact members (24, 25, 35) capable of being point-contacted 
with the tool holding members (13, 14, 33, 114). The 

rotatable contact members (24, 25, 35) when contacted with 
the tool holding members (13, 14, 33, 114) is rotatable with 

the tool holding members (13, 14, 33, 114).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dental handpiece on
which a tool for dental treatment can be mounted detachably.
More particularly, it relates to a dental handpiece having a
rotatable contact member capable of preventing mechanical or
thermal injuries otherwise caused by mistaken detachment
operation of the dental treatment tool mounted thereon.Up to now, a dental handpiece having a dental
treatment tool mounted thereon has been used extensively for
dental treatment. Such conventional dental handpiece is now
explained by referring to Fig.4.Fig.4 shows the distal end part of a conventional
dental handpiece 40 which is made up of a head casing 41 for
mounting a dental treatment tool 9 thereon and a head cap 42
threadedly attached to an upper part of the head casing 41.Within the interior of the head casing 41, there is
detachably mounted an inner casing 54 made up of a cartridge
casing 54a and a casing cap 54b. The cartridge casing 54a
has various components for holding and rotating the dental
treatment tool 9 as later explained. Within the inner casing
54, there are arranged a rotary shaft 44 having a collet 43
detachably holding the dental treatment tool 9 and ball
bearings 45, 46 for rotatably supporting the rotary shaft 44.The collet 43 has plural axially extending slits 
43a to permit the inner periphery at its lower end to be
enlarged in diameter. The outer periphery of the collet 43
presents a tapered surface 55, the diameter of which is
progressively increased towards the lower side. The collet
43 has its upper end projected above the rotary shaft 44 and
formed with female screw threads. A spring 47 is placed
around the outer periphery of the upper end of the collet 43.
The upper tapped end of the collet 43 is engaged with a
flange 49 having male screw threads 48.The rotary shaft 44 is tubular and is formed at its
lower end with a tool receiving opening 44a for receiving the
dental treatment tool 9 therein. A rotor 44b in the form of
an impeller is mounted on the outer periphery of the rotary
shaft 44 for rotationally driving the rotary shaft 44. The
rotary shaft 44 has its inner surface formed as a tapered
surface 55 shaped for mating with the outer periphery of the
collet 44. By such tapered inner peripheral surface of the
rotary shaft 44, the collet 43 biased by the spring 47 in an
upper direction, is pressed and held by the rotary shaft 44.The ball bearings 45, 46 are arranged at the upper
and lower portions of the rotary shaft 44, and are engaged
with and retained by the head casing 41 and the
