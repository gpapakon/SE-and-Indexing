<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ball valve which is
opened and shut through rotation of a spindle to rotate a
valve ball engaged with the spindle, wherein a neck portion
of a valve body bearing the spindle is integrally provided
with a top flange.A ball valve with these features is disclosed in EP 0 373
090 A1, where an actuator is mounted on the flange to automatically
rotate the spindle. There is, however, no simple
possibility to mount a handle instead of the actuator.US-A 5 090 447 shows a ball valve rotated by a spindle
which is connected to a handle. This valve, however, is not
made for using an actuator instead of the handle.Hitherto, therefore, ball valves have been generally prepared
for a manual type or an automatic type respectively,
and separately used in accordance with the purpose thereof.In the case of a manual type, a ball valve is opened and
shut by manually rotating a handle mounted on a spindle borne
in a neck portion of a valve body so as to rotate a valve
ball, while in the case of an automatic type, the ball valve
is opened and shut in the same manner as above by rotating
the spindle by an actuator mounted on the upper portion of
the valve body. However, separately preparing the valves of both types
results in a higher manufacturing cost, and there is a further
problem when a manual type ball valve mounted on a pipe
line is converted to an automatic type, in that the ball
valve must be wholly replaced. In order to solve such problems,
study has been carried out to convert the manual type
ball valve to the automatic type while using the valve body
of the former, and an example of the above is disclosed in
Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 62-69677.According to the valve disclosed in the above Publication,
a mounting body is secured to a manual type (ball)
valve body and grips the valve body from the upper and lower
sides thereof to form a mounting device, and an actuator is
attached to the thus-formed mounting device to convert the
valve into an automatic type.In the valve of the above type, however, there are the
following problems:
a mounting device is necessary when the actuator is attached;the actuator may deviate from center because it is not
directly secured to the valve body;the operation of the actuator may become unstable due to
loosening of the mounting device;a separately-prepared saddle is necessary for fixing a
pipe directly connected to the valve body;
anda mount is necessary for a panel piping.Also, another example of a ball valve capable of being
