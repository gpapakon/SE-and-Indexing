<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a surfactant 
composition comprising a secondary alkyl sulfate, and the 
surfactant composition so prepared. In conventional practice, secondary alkyl sulfates have been 
prepared by reaction of olefins or alcohols with sulfuric acid 
followed by neutralization of the intermediate secondary alkyl 
sulfuric acid with aqueous base, usually sodium hydroxide. The 
process is complicated by incomplete reaction of the starting 
olefin or alcohol and by formation of dialkyl sulfates which 
saponify during the neutralization step, noted above, to equal 
molar amounts of secondary alkyl sulfate and secondary alcohol. Unreacted olefin and secondary alcohol, which can amount to 
50 percent by weight (%wt) or more of the starting olefin, are 
generally removed from the secondary alkyl sulfate by a process of 
extraction with an organic solvent as described in U.S. Patent 
4,175,092. The extraction process can be complicated by the 
formation of highly viscous, undesirable emulsions and gels as well 
as by the dissolution of some of the extracting solvent in the 
aqueous secondary alkyl sulfate phase. Extracting solvents frequently 
have objectionable odours and must be removed from the 
aqueous surfactant solution, an operation which can be accompanied 
by severe foaming difficulties. When extraction is complete, the 
concentration of secondary alkyl sulfate in water is generally in 
the range of 20-40% by weight (F. Asinger, Mono-Olefins: Chemistry 
and Technology, 1968, pp. 689-694). It would therefore be advantageous to have a solid and/or 
non-solid surfactant composition comprising a secondary alkyl 
sulfate which is substantially free of water and unreacted organic 
matter, thus allowing maximum flexibility.  
 A process for preparing surfactant compositions has been 
found in which secondary alkyl sulfates derived from olefins and/or 
alcohols can be generated in a manner such that a solid secondary 
alkyl sulfate-containing product and/or a highly concentrated 
non-solid secondary alkyl sulfate-containing product are obtained. 
These products can be used as surfactants and/or detergent compositions 
and are particularly suitable for household applications. The invention provides a process for preparing solid and/or 
non-solid surfactant compositions comprising a secondary alkyl 
sulfate which are substantially free of unreacted organic matter 
and water. These surfactant compositions are prepared by the 
process of claim 1. Specifically, the present process
