<ABSTRACT>
A fire control system (55) azimuth command and elevation command provides a flight control system attitude reference in response to operation of the flight control system in a coupled aiming mode. The coupled aiming mode is engaged in response to the continuous operation of a pilot switch (920), the azimuth command and elevation command being below respective threshold magnitudes (940, 941), and the operation of the fire control system (55). During operation in the coupled aiming mode, the azimuth command and elevation command replace the yaw attitude feedback error signal and pitch attitude error signal, respectively, as the aircraft attitude reference. During integration of the fire control system and the flight control system, the flight control system is made less sensitive to small pilot command stick inputs below a stick input threshold magnitude, so that small or inadvertent pilot commanded yaw and pitch maneuvers will not affect the yaw and pitch attitude reference commanded by the fire control system azimuth and elevation commands. However, intended pilot commanded yaw and pitch maneuvers (70) maintain full authority at all times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flight control 
systems for rotary wing aircraft and more 
particularly to an integrated fire and flight control 
system which provides aircraft azimuth and pitch 
control based on a fire control system targeting 
solution. The combat uses for helicopter aircraft have 
changed dramatically over the years to include 
contact with opposing forces, including 
reconnaissance and combat aircraft assistance of 
troops on the front line. This type of use subjects 
helicopters to numerous threats, and therefore new 
helicopter designs incorporate offensive weapons, 
such as Gatling guns and rocket launchers. Initially, the primary control of helicopter 
weapons was accomplished by the pilot aiming the 
aircraft at the target prior to firing. Correction 
for misses was accomplished by the pilot adjusting 
the attitude of the aircraft prior to expending 
additional ordnance. As technology developed, 
tracking and sensing systems were used to locate the 
target and determine the aircraft attitude necessary 
to aim the weapon so as to account for outside forces 
acting onthe ordnance, e.g., wind, aircraft speed, 
etc. Such a system typically displays a "cross-hair" 
indicative of actual aircraft attitude and a 
geometric shape indicative of the required aircraft  
 
attitude to provide a high probability of striking the target with the 
weapon. The pilot is required to maneuver the aircraft so as to place the 
cross-hair in the firing solution defined by the shape prior to firing the 
weapon. The aiming instructions e.g., cross-hair and geometric shape, 
are typically displayed on a control panel, a heads-up display, or helmet-mounted 
display which provides the pilot with visual information 
relating to the target position, ownship attitude, heading, speed and 
altitude. Although such aiming systems improved weapons delivery accuracy, the 
pilot is still under a significant burden to regulate aircraft heading and 
pitch attitude. It is well-known that a skilled helicopter pilot can control 
aircraft attitude within about 1° of pitch and yaw. Although this may 
seem very accurate control, a 1° variation in pitch or yaw will have a 
significant effect on the trajectory of a projectile. Document US-A-5,001,646 discloses an automatic helicopter flight 
control system wherein control decoupling is provided to reduce 
undesired helicopter responses in other axes to pilot inputs in one axis. 
Automatic control of heading and ground track at low air speeds is also 
provided. Finally,
