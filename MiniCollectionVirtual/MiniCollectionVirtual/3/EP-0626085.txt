<ABSTRACT>
A credit card (10) includes an integral magnifying lens (24) positioned in the non-data area on the credit card for permitting magnification of the credit card transaction form at the point-of-sale. The placement of the lens assures that the machine readability of the magnetic encoding strip (14) and the embossed indicia (12) associated with the card is not impaired. The magnifying lens (24) incorporates a fresnel-type contour lens (36) mounted in a window (25) provided in the credit card base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to pocket magnifiers
and is specifically directed to a financial transaction card having an
integral magnifying lens.There have long been reading lenses and
magnifying glasses available to assist people in
reading books, documents and the like without the use
of reading glasses. These are particularly useful
when the person encounters small print during an
activity which makes it inconvenient or difficult to
stop and put on reading glasses.As an example, a book mark such as that shown in
U.S. Patent 3,140,863 issued to R.L. Anthony on
July 14, 1964 may be integrally attached to a book
such as a telephone directory or a dictionary,
wherein the end of the book mark is provided with a
sealed pocket for receiving a plastic magnifying
lens. The magnifying lens may be moved up and down
the page as desired to provide magnification of the
text in the book. This permits the user to read the
text without first putting on his eyeglasses.A pocket magnifier such as that shown in U.S.
Patent 3,409,347 issued to R. Vogel on November 5,
1968 includes a pocket pouch adapted to be carried in
the breast or hip pocket of the user or in a purse or
wallet. The lens is formed of a transparent plastic
sheet material having a substantial degree of
stiffness and having fresnel lens contours molded
into its upper surface. The lens unit may be slidably
retracted into and extended out of the pocket. The
pocket magnifier may be easily utilized to magnify
small print and the like when the user is in a 
location where it is not feasible or desirable to
stop an activity in order to put on reading glasses.Other examples of special purposes magnifying
lens structures shown, by way of example, in U.S.
Patent No. 4,044,889 entitled "COSMETIC CONTAINER
INCLUDING INTEGRATED LENS STRUCTURE" issued to S.
Orentreich et al on August 30, 1977 and U.S. Patent
No. 4,393,610 entitled "CARD CARRYING MICROFILM AND
ASSOCIATED READING LENS AND PROCESS OF FORMING SAME"
issued to D. Adrian on July 19, 1983.With the ever expanding use of credit cards and
other financial transaction cards, there is an
increasing requirement that the card user be able to
verify a transaction at the point-of-use. This means
the user must be able to read the card invoice to
determine the accuracy of the information before he
signs the invoice to indicate his acceptance. Since
most of the information on the invoice is impact
printed either on a carbon set or carbonless form,
the print is not only controlled in size but is often
of a low contrast with
