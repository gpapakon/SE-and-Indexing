<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a metering device (10) for volumetric dispensing of a liquid additive which is added in a specific volume ratio to a liquid flowing in a first tube line (11), in particular drawn-off blood, this addition being effected via a second tube line (12) which opens directly or indirectly into the first tube line. The metering device (10) according to the invention is intended in particular for volumetric dispensing of an anticoagulant liquid (ACD) or a sedimentation accelerator in a system for collection and retransfusion of autologous blood, which system has a tube or pipe section extending downstream of the junction point (14), and also a drip chamber (18) connected downstream of the drip tube (16), and a light barrier (30) whose direction of action is transverse to the direction in which the drops fall. In order to rule out the possibility of incorrect dispensing resulting from changing viscosities of the liquid flowing in the first tube line (11) and associated changes in the size of the drops, it is proposed according to the invention to provide two electrically controllable valve means (22, 23), of which in each case one is included in one of the two tube lines (11, 12), and to control these valve means (22, 23) alternately by means of a counting and controlling unit (CPU, RAM) so that in each case only one of the two aforesaid tubes (11, 12) is switched on-line at any one time. The liquid remaining in the drip tube (16) due to the capillary effect in this case provides for a constancy of volume between drops falling at the lower end of the drip tube (16) and additive being metered in at the upper end of the drip tube (16).

A metering device for the volumetric dispensing of a liquid additive
which is added to a fluid flowing through a first pipe (11) in a specific

volumetric ratio and through a second pipe (12), and with

electrically operable valve means (22, 23) incorporated into both pipes
(11, 12) and in each case and alternately switching only one of the two pipes

through to a common tube or pipe portion (16) on the downstream side,
a counting and control unit (CPU, RAM) and
a dropping chamber (18) with a light barrier (30) adjacent the common
tube or pipe portion (16) and the directional action of which is crosswise to the

path through which the drops fall,

characterised in that
the drops falling in the dropper chamber (18) can be counted by the
counting unit (CPU, RAM) and the valve means (22, 23) can be alternately

operated by the control unit (CPU, RAM) after a predetermined number of drops
so that the common tube or pipe portion (16) is alternately connected to the

first or second pipe (11, 12).
A metering device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
valve means are a 4/2-way valve (22).
A metering device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
valve means are a 3/2-way valve. 
A metering device according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterised
in that the valve means (22) are spring-loaded, whereby in the inoperative

position, the first pipe (11) is switched to through-flow.
A metering device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
valve means are a 3/3-way valve (23) having a spring-centred central position

in which both pipes (11, 12) are closed.
A metering device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the counting and control unit comprises a central

processing unit (CPU) and furthermore a freely programmable memory (RAM)
and furthermore input means in order to key in a value (N) representing a

number of drops and in that the central processing unit (CPU) generates a
control pulse for alternately actuating the valve means (22, 23) when the

ascertained number of drops reaches the value (N) stored in the memory (RAM).
A metering device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the counting and control unit comprises a freely

programmable memory (RAM) in which a memory site is provided for a constant
(A) which corresponds to the number of drops of additive to be added per

switching cycle of the valve means. 
A metering device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the counting and control unit comprises a ce
ntral
processing unit (CPU) and a freely programmable memory (RAM) in which there

is stored for the processing unit a working programme which alternately
operates the valve means (22, 23) in such a way that after a definite number

of switching cycles of the valve means a switching cycle is carried out in which
the second pipe (12) carrying the additive is switched to through-flow until such

time as the volume of additive which has flowed through and which has been
ascertained by the light barrier (30) corresponds to the volume of the tube or

pipe portion (16) and possibly dead spaces contained in the valve means (22,
23).
A metering device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the two pipes (11, 12), the valve means (22, 23), the tube

or pipe portion (16) an the dropper chamber (18) are constructed as disposable
parts.
A metering device according to claim 9, characterised in that the
dropper chamber (18) and the light barrier (30) are so constructed that the

dropper chamber which is constructed as a disposable part can be locked in the
correspondingly constructed light barrier. 
A metering device according to claim 10, characterised in that the
dropper chamber (18) can be snap-fitted positively in the component containing

the light barrier (30).
