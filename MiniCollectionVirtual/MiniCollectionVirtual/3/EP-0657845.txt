<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a technique which
can protect security of data until a regular user who

transmits print data directs to start printing on the
side of a printing apparatus even in an environment

where a plurality of host computers on a network use a
common printing apparatus, and which can print image

data which has already been produced, as it is after the
user gives instructions to start printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing
apparatus and a printing method in which text data is
received from host computers on a network and then
printed.In a conventional system employing a network, when
electronic mail data is received, a password is
invariably verified. Since only the user licensed to
see data can access data requiring security protection,
this system is excellent for security protection of
data.On the other hand, when it is assumed that the
above data is to be printed, a printer shared by a
number of users is frequently used. In this case, even
if the process of verifying a password is performed,
when the operator who directs output of the data is not
present at the printer station, the print output of the
data requiring security is delivered onto a delivery 
tray or delivery base, thereby creating a condition
where a third person can easily see the data.Such a system thus has the potential problem of
the output print itself being delivered from the printer
even if the process for security protection of data is
performed, as described above.In order to avoid the possibility that output data
can be seen by an unauthorized person, it is considered
that a common printer not be used, and that a personal
printer be dedicated for receipt of secure data.
However, this has not only the problem of compelling a
great economic load but also the problem of occupying a
limited space.There is also the problem that when the data
requiring security is output, the operator who gives
directions to output the data must always move to the
location where the printer is installed, and thus has
a heavier workload.In the typical example, since the transmitted text
data is output immediately after being received by a
printing apparatus, there is further the problem that
text data which must not be seen by other users cannot
be output, particularly, in those cases where the user
is at a distance from the printing apparatus. The JP-A-04 075 128 refers to a printer controller, in which
print processing is set in a holding state until permission
information is input when a secret document is received. The
document data of the secret document is deleted when no
permission information is input within a prescribed period.
Moreover it is described that print processing is executed
when the permission information is input within the
prescribed period.Moreover, the JP-A-04 227 525 discloses a system for
confirming a message of a work station on a printer by a
communication between the work station and the printer

<CLAIMS>
A printing apparatus, having an operating display, to
perform printing on the basis of printing information

received from a plurality of host units, comprising:

development means for developing said printing
information into output data;
storage means for storing the output data;
judgment means for judging whether or not said
received printing information is printing information that

requires input of verification before performing printing,
and, in case of judging that it is necessary to input

verification information by said judgment means, storing
corresponding output data in the storage means;
demand means for causing the operating display to
demand an input of user information to said operating

display part for identifying a user and the predetermined
verification information for providing printing allowance

of said output image data stored in said storage means; and
control means for performing print processing of
output data collated from a plurality of output data which

are stored in the developed state,
in case of confirming user information and
verification information which are input from said

operating display in accordance with the demand by said
demand means and designating the correct verification

information as verification information of printing
information corresponding to the user information.
A printing apparatus according to claim 1, further

comprising:

transmission means for transmitting user information
and verification information instructed to be input from

said operating display in accordance with the demand by
said demand means to said host unit, and
wherein said control means is arranged to control
print processing of said image data on the basis of the

collation result from said host unit to verification
information transmitted from said transmission means.
A printing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, in
case of receiving printing information which does not

require input of verification while storing output data in
which printing information that requires input of

verification is developed and obtained in a hard disc, the
control means is arranged to control transmission order of

output data generated to be output to a printer engine
prior to output data stored in a hard disc.
A printing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
printing apparatus is capable of face-up output and

face-down output of the printed face of recording medium,
and said control means is arranged to control print

processing by face-down output regardless of the that it is
designation of document data, in case of judging that it is

the document information that requires input of
verification by said judging means.
A printing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
verification information is a password and said user

information is a user name. 
A printing method in a printing apparatus, having an
operating display, to perform printing on the basis of

printing information received from a plurality of host
units, said method comprising the steps of:


judging whether or not said received printing
information is printing information that requires input of

verification before performing printing;
in case of judging that it is necessary to input
verification information in said judging step, developing

said printing information into output data and storing the
output data in storage means before an input of the

predetermined verification information as a password;
causing the operating display to demand an input of
user information to said operating display part for

identifying a user and the predetermined verification
information for providing printing allowance of said output

image data stored in said storage means; and
in case of confirming user information and
verification information which are input from said

operating display in accordance with the demand and
designating the correct verification information as

verification information of printing information
corresponding to the user information, performing print

processing of output data collated from a plurality of
output data which are stored in the developed state.
A printing method according to claim 6, further
comprising the steps of:


transmitting user information and verification
information instructed to be input from said operating

display in accordance with the demand to said host unit,
and
wherein print processing of said image data is
controlled on the basis of the collation result from said 

host unit to verification information transmitted in said
transmitting step.
A printing method according to claim 6, wherein, in case
of receiving printing information which does not require

input of verification while storing output data in which
printing information that requires input of verification is

developed and obtained in a hard disc, transmission order
of output data generated to be output to a printer engine

prior to output data stored in a hard disc is controlled.
A printing method according to claim 6, wherein said
printing apparatus is capable of face-up output and

face-down output of the printed face of recording medium,
and

   print processing is controlled by face-down output
regardless of the designation of document data, in case of

judging that it is the document information that requires
input of verification.
A printing method according to claim 6, wherein said
