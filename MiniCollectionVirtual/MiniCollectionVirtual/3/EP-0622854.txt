<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device capable to being turned on and off by
an insulated gate electrode, and in particular, to a
complex semiconductor device having a reduced resistance
loss in the on state and being particularly suitable for
developing a high breakdown voltage or allowing a large
current.Due to requirement of high performance of
power transducers including inverter systems, it has
been desired to develop a high-speed semiconductor
switching device attended with a reduced loss.
Recently, as a semiconductor device satisfying the
requirement, an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)
has attracted attentions. The IGBT has, when compared
with a metal insulator semiconductor field effect
transistor (MISFET), features of a decreased on-state
voltage. Moreover, as compared with device of a current
control type such as a GTO thyristor, the IGBT has
advantages, for example, it has a higher operation speed
and its gate circuit is simple and can be implemented in
a compact structure. Consequently, centered on an
inverter of a relatively small capacity, the application
range thereof is expanding. Such an IGBT has been described, for example,
in pages 220 to 225 of the Proceedings of 1991
International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices
& ICs, Tokyo. Fig. 15 shows a schematic cross-sectional
configuration of the IGBT. In the diagram, numeral 400
indicates an n--type layer adjacent to a principal
surface 411, numeral 401 denotes an n--type layer which
is adjacent to the n--type layer 400 and which has an
impurity concentration higher than that of the layer
400, numeral 402 designates a p+-type layer adjacent to
the n--type layer 401 and a principal surface 412,
numeral 403 stands for a p-type layer which extends from
the principal surface 411 into the n--type layer 400 and
which has an impurity concentration higher than that of
the layer 400, numeral 404 indicates an n+-type layer
which extends from the principal surface 411 into the p-type
layer 403 and which has an impurity concentration
higher than that of the layer 403, numeral 405 denotes a
cathode electrode which is brought into contact with the
n+-type layer 404 and the p-type 403 in the principal
surface 411, a numeral 406 designates an anode electrode
being brought into contact with the p+-type layer 402 in
the principal surface 412, and numeral 407 stands for an
insulated gate electrode formed via an insulation layer
408 at least on the p-type layer 403 on the principal
surface 411. The semiconductor device
