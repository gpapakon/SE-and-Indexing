<ABSTRACT>
A photosensitive member having stable 
electrophotographic characteristics can be constituted 

by an electroconductive support and a photosensitive 
layer disposed thereon and containing a fullerene 

compound having an organosilicon group as a charge-transporting 
substance. The fullerene compound may 

preferably have a polyhedral structure, particularly 
that of Buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀) and be represented 

by the formula: C₆₀(A)
n
 ...(2), wherein A denotes an 
organosilicon group represented by the formula: 


(wherein R₁₋₁ and R₁₋₂ independently denote a hydrogen 
atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a 

substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a substituted 
or unsubstituted alkoxy group, a substituted or 

unsubstituted silyl group, a substituted or 
unsubstituted germyl group, a halogen atom, or a group 

constituting a substituted or unsubstituted ring by a 
mutual combination of R₁₋₁ and R₁₋₂ together with the 

Si atom in the formula); and n is an integer of 1 to 
5, and a plurality of A in the case of n being two or 

larger can be the same or different with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic photosensitive member,
particularly an electrophotographic photosensitive
member having a photosensitive layer containing a
fullerene compound of a specific structure. The
present invention further relates to an
electrophotographic apparatus and an apparatus unit
including the electrophotographic photosensitive
member.Electrophotographic photosensitive members
using an organic photoconductive substance have
advantages, such as a very high productivity, a
relative inexpensiveness, and a free controllability
of sensitive wavelength region by appropriate
selection of dyes or pigments used, and accordingly
have been widely studied. Particularly, owing to the
development of a function separation-type
photosensitive member including a laminate of a charge
generation layer comprising a so-called charge
generation substance such as an organic
photoconductive dye or pigment and a charge transport
layer comprising a charge transport substance, 
remarkable improvements have been made with respect to
sensitivity and durability which had been considered
as difficulties of conventional organic
electrophotographic photosensitive members.A charge transporting substance used for the
above purposes is required to be (1) stable against
light and heat, (2) stable against ozone, NOx, nitric
acid, etc., generated by corona discharge, (3) having
a high charge-transporting ability, and a good mutual
solubility with an organic solvent and a binding
agent. There have been known charge transporting
substances, inclusive of, e.g., pyrazoline compounds
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) 52-4188,
hydrazone compounds as disclosed in JP-B 55-42380
and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A)
55-42063, triphenylamine compounds as disclosed in
JP-B 58-32372 and JP-A 61-132955, and stilbene
compounds as disclosed in JP-A 58-198043. Further,
U.S. Patent No. 5,178,980 has disclosed an
electrophotographic photosensitive member using a
fullerene compound as a charge transporting substance.Fullerenes have been known as a novel class
of carbon allotropes as represented by Buckminsterfullerene
(C60), have various interesting physical and
chemical properties attributable to a special and
unique molecular structure thereof and therefore
constitute a group of substances as very interesting 
novel carbon substance. Particularly, since the
invention of a method for mass synthesis of C60 by W.
Kraetchemer, et al (Nature, 1990, 347,345), there have
been made extensive studies
