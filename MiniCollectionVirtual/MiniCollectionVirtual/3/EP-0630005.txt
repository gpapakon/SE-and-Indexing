<ABSTRACT>
An optical information recording/reproducing 
apparatus records information on and/or reproduces 

information from an optical recording medium and 
detects a focal error based on a reflected light beam 

from the optical recording medium. The apparatus 
includes an optical element (15, 15A, 25, 25A, 85, 85A, 

95, 95A, 105, 105A, 105B, 35, 45, 55) which deflects a 
part of the reflected light beam to at least two 

positions excluding a central part of the reflected 
light beam, and a photodetector device (16, 26, 36, 56, 

66, 216A) having a plurality of photodetectors which 
respectively detect the deflected parts of the 

reflected light beam and output detection outputs. The 
focal error is detected based on the detection outputs 

of the photodetector device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to optical
information recording/reproducing apparatuses, and more
particularly to an optical information recording/reproducing
apparatus which optically records information on a recording
medium and/or optically reproduces the information
from the recording medium.From JP-A-03 157 821 there is known a method and
device for positioning a light spot on a recording medium
with using a prism and a photodetector arrangement. The
prism is arranged to split a luminous flux into at least
three beams for detecting a focus by the Foucault method.
Photodetectors are provided to the respective split beams,
two photodetectors are used for detecting the focus, and
the quantity of light incident on the said two photodetectors
is controlled respectively to about 40% of that of the
entire luminous flux. Accordingly, the spot diameter of the
beam received by each photodetector can be increased.From JP-A-63 249 942 an optical information recording/reproducing
apparatus is known which records information
on and/or reproduces information from an optical recording
medium and detects a focal error based on a reflected
light beam from the optical recording medium. The
apparatus includes an optical element which detects a part
of the reflected light beam to at least two positions excluding
a central part of the reflected light beam, and a
photodetector device having a plurality of photodetectors
which respectively detect the deflected parts of the reflected
light beam and output detection outputs. The focal
error is detected based on the detection outputs of the
photodetector device. The document US-A-5,105,411 discloses a light
beam focussing device with which a light beam emitted from
a semiconductor laser is converged on a recording surface
of an optical disk by a lens. The light beam is intensity-modulated
and reflected in accordance with information recorded
on the optical disk. The light beam is guided to a
photodetector through a light beam diverging unit. The diverging
unit is formed of first and second glass plates individually
having parallel flat surfaces. A gap is formed
between the first and second glass plates such that the
glass plates are situated at substantially equal distances
from the optical axis. The glass plates are oppositely
tilted to the optical axis. The light beam is divided into
three light beams by the first and second glass plates, the
three light beams including first and second light beams
and a third light beam which passes through the gap between
the
