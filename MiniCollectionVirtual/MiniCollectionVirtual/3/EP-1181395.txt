<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method that can be carried out in parallel and automated for the production of any nucleic acid, comprising the following steps: a) coupling an oligonucleotide to a solid matrix; b) adding an additional oligonucleotide; c) performing ligation of the oligonucleotide from steps a) and b) in an orientation; d) removing excess reactants and enzymes from the reaction preparation; e) effecting cleavage of the ligation product from step c) with a restriction system that cleaves outside the recognition sequence, whereby cleavage is effected in the shortened or lengthened oligonucleotide from step a) or in the oligonucleotide from step b); f) separating the reaction mixture from the lengthened or shortened oligonucleotide from step a); g) repeating at least one steps b) to f); h) performing successive sequence-independent linkage of the fragments obtained after executing steps a) to g) until the desired product is obtained.

A method for the manufacture of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the steps of

a) providing an oligonucleotide which is prepared by the following steps:

aa) coupling of an oligonucleotide with one end to a solid matrix, whereby the coupling occurs through a modification and the oligonucleotide comprises a recognition sequence for a type IIS restriction enzyme which cuts outside its recognition sequence,
ab) adding a further, at least partially double-stranded oligonucleotide having a recognition sequence for a type IIS restriction enzyme which cuts outside its recognition sequence, whereby the recognition sequence is different from the one in step aa) and whereby this oligonucleotide cannot bind to the matrix,
ac) ligating the oligonucleotide of step aa) and ab) in the orientation which is defined by the blocking of the ends not to be ligated,
ad) removing non-spent reactants and enzymes,
ae) cleaving the ligation product of step ac) with a type IIS restriction enzyme which cuts outside of its recognition sequence, whereby the cleavage occurs in the nucleic acid sequence of the oligonucleotide of step ab),
af) separating the reaction mixture from the extended oligonucleotide of step aa) as obtained in step ae),
ag) repeating steps ab) to af) at least one time,
b) providing a further oligonucleotide which is prepared by the steps of:

ba) coupling of an oligonucleotide with one end to a solid matrix, whereby the coupling occurs through a modification, and the oligonucleotide comprises a recognition sequence for a type ITS restriction enzyme which cuts outside its recognition sequence,
bb) adding a further, at least partially double-stranded oligonucleotide having a recognition sequence for a type IIS restriction enzyme which cuts outside its recognition sequence, whereby the recognition sequence is different from the one in step ba) and whereby this oligonucleotide cannot bind to the matrix,
bc) ligating the oligonucleotides of step ba) and bb) in the orientation which is defined by the blocking of the ends not to be ligated,
bd) removing non-spent reactants and enzymes,
be) cleaving the ligation product of step bc) with a type IIS restriction enzyme which cuts outside of its recognition sequence, whereby the cleavage occurs in the oligonucleotide of step bb),
bf) separating the thus extended nucleic acid molecule from the reaction mixture,
bg) repeating steps bb) to bf) at least one time, whereby subsequent to the last ligation in step bc) and removal of non-spent reactants as well as enzymes the ligation product is cut with a type IIS restriction enzyme, whereby the cleavage occurs in the oligonucleotide of step ba),
c) ligating the oligonucleotides of step a) and b) in the orientation defined by the blocking of the ends not to be ligated,
d) removing non-spent reactants and enzymes,
e) cleaving the ligation product of step c) with a type IIS restriction enzyme which cuts outside its recognition sequence, whereby the cleavage occurs in the oilgonucleotide of step a) or b),
f) separating the thus extended nucleic acid molecule from the reaction mixture.
