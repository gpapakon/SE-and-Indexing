<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to a height-adjustable 
parcel carrier for bicycles etc., characterized in that 

clamping means (5,10,11) are provided on said parcel carrier, 
either for the two and two clamps of the supporting 

rods (2) connected to each other in form of a bracket und 
having the desired length, or to clamp a bracket (8), that 

may connect the parcel carrier with the rear fork (9) at 
any angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a height-adjustable 
parcel carrier for bicycles etc. The invention has for its object the development 
of a new and original, height-adjustable parcel 
carrier with the possibility of being adjusted at any 
time to the correct horizontal position, that may also 
be the angle the rear fork encloses with the vertical 
plane. In a measure the conception "horizontal" matches 
the conception "height-adjustable". The angle between the vertical plane and the 
rear fork differs strongly as far as it concerns a 
lady's or a gentlemen's bicycle. This angle varies also 
depending on the height of the frame and naturally on 
the type of bicycle. Therefore this causes problems in 
connection with the horizontal position of the carrier 
frame to be mounted to the bicycle. To that effect solutions have already been 
proposed and described in two patent applications, 
namely in the following patents: DE 40 05 009 A1 and EP 
0 530 403 A2. In the case of the parcel carrier according 
to the DE patent the supporting rods attached to the 
wheel naves can only be blocked at a well defined angle 
with respect to the parcel carrier. In the EP patent a bracket connecting the 
parcel carrier with the cycle frame is adjustable and 
can be blocked at various angles. To enable this adjustment, 
however, tools are required as for instance a 
key or a screwdriver. Moreover the structure according  
 
to the EP application shows the disadvantage of a 
detachment of the movable connection between the said 
bracket and the parcel carrier when using the bicycle. To remedy the drawbacks of the parcel carrier 
constructed according to the above patents and to give 
a solution ensuring the required clamping between the 
various parts without the need of some accessory (key 
or screwdriver) according to the invention clamping 
means are provided on said parcel carrier, either for 
the pair and pair clamps of the supporting rods connected 
to each other in form of a bracket and having the 
desired length, or to clamp a bracket, that may connect 
the parcel carrier with the rear fork at any angle. In a first embodiment above clamping means 
for the above supporting rods consist of hooks welded 
underneath the parcel carrier alternatively directed in 
the one or the other direction and of transverse rods 
welded therewith to the parcel carrier, between these 
hooks and transverse rods clamping being possible of 
the part of the above bracket extending between two 
supporting rods. In a highly remarkable embodiment
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A height-adjustable parcel carrier for 
bicycles etc., characterized in that clamping means are 

provided on said parcel carrier, either for the pair 
and pair clamps of the supporting rods connected to 

each other in form of a bracket und having the desired 
length, or to clamp a bracket, that may connect the 

parcel carrier with the rear fork at any angle. 
A parcel carrier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that above clamping means for the 

above supporting rods consist of hooks welded underneath 
the parcel carrier alternatively directed in the 

one or the other direction and of transverse rods 
welded therewith to the parcel carrier, between these 

hooks and transverse rods clamping the part of the 
above bracket extending between two supporting rods 

being possible. 
A parcel carrier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that above clamping means consist of 

hooks provided underneath the above parcel carrier 
alternatively directed in the one or other direction, 

and in that between them the part of the above bracket 
extending between two supporting rods can be clamped. 
A parcel carrier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that underneath the parcel carrier 

channel type clamping means are provided with two 
parallel walls, in which recesses are provided having 

such a profile that the recesses of one wall do not 
match with the recesses of the other wall and do not 

have a common centre line in such a way that the part 
of a bracket connecting the parcel carrier with the 

rear fork of the bicycle respectively a part of the 
bracket extending between above supporting rods are 

kept in a clamped position in two opposite recesses 
each as an element of the above walls. 
A parcel carrier as claimed in claim 4, 
 

characterized in that the recesses in a wall are hooked 
and extend at a nonright angle with respect tot the 

longitudinal axis of said channel, whereas the recesses 
in the other wall extend perpendicularly to this longitudinal 

axis. 
A parcel carrier as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that the recesses in both walls are 

hooked and extend in each wall at a nonright angle, the 
recesses in one wall extending in one direction and the 

recesses in the other wall extending in the opposite 
direction.
