<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a noise suppresser for use in a signal transmission
system of an asymmetrically balanced type, as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.
A noise suppresser of this kind is known from JP-A-59047857.The afore-mentioned document discloses a system for inserting an additional circuit
in a stereo modulator and demodulator. To reduce noise of a sum signal or a
difference signal at a low frequency stage, an additional circuit such as a noise
reduction circuit is inserted to either a sum signal line or a difference signal line
between a matrix circuit and a de-matrix circuit. The matrix circuit receives the left
and right signals and outputs the sum signal and the difference signal. The de-matrix
circuit receives the sum signal and the difference signal and outputs
individually the left and right signals. The additional circuit, such as a noise
reduction circuit, is inserted to either line between the matrix and de-matrix circuit.
The left and right signals are switched at switching circuits and superimposed and
outputted as a carrier suppression amplitude modulation signal forming a composite
signal for main carrier modulation. Thereby, the noise in the difference signal at the
low frequency stage is reduced by the additional circuit.Conventionally, in a transmission system for 
transmitting signals to plural signal lines, for example, a
transmission system having two signals, R (right) and L
(left), of a stereo signal, for suppression or removal of noise
components in signals, a noise suppressor has been provided
for R and L signals, respectively, to suppress or remove the
noise components. As such noise suppressor, a noise limiter
for simply limiting a noise level of a signal level or a
higher level, a noise suppressor for dividing a signal to
plural frequency bands, determining noise components in the
signal, suppressing the noise components by providing a
filter coefficient for cutting out the noise components to a
bandpass filter (BPF) that is capable of controlling a
bandpass characteristic for each of the frequency bands, and
summing the frequency components thereafter and the like are
used. These noise suppressors are also applied to a
transmission system of balanced type in relation to noises.However, it is a problem of such noise suppressing
means that a sufficient noise suppressing effect cannot be
obtained, when a noise component is low, because it is
difficult to determine the noise component in a signal.In consideration of such problem of conventional noise
suppresso
