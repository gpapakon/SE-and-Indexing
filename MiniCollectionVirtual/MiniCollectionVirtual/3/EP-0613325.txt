<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tubular heating element whose end (1a) has inside a jacket tube (1) an empty space which accommodates a protection element (36, 37, 38), a switching device being provided which, on reaching a specific temperature, is tripped by the protection element (36, 37, 38). It is furthermore provided that the protection element (36, 37, 38) is inserted into the end (1a) of the jacket tube (1) independently of the jacket tube (1) and that the switching device, on reaching the specific temperature, is tripped by the change of the shape of the protection element (36, 37, 38) pretensioned in the direction of a switching-off process.
