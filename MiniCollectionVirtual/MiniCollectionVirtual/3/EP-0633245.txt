<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new vitamin D compounds, to a method of 
preparing these compounds and to their use in pharmacotherapy and 
cosmetics. The invention further relates to valuable new intermediates. It is generally known, that vitamin-D compounds or vitamin-D related 
compounds ("vitamin-D compounds") have a strong biological activity and 
may be used in all those cases in which problems with the calcium 
metabolism play a part. A few years ago it was found that various active 
vitamin-D compounds also have other pharmacotherapeutic activities and 
may be used successfully, for example, for the treatment of certain skin 
and bone diseases, for cosmetic applications and for treating diseases 
which are related to cell differentiation, cell proliferation or 
imbalance in the immune system, including diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
asthma. In addition, these compounds may be used in various veterinary 
applications, and for diagnostic purposes. Vitamin D compounds which are of interest for the above applications are 
hydroxylated vitamin D compounds, in particular vitamin D compounds 
hydroxylated in the 1α-, 24- and/or 25-positions. Recent developments in 
the field of active vitamin D compounds are 19-nor-vitamin D compounds 
(EP-A-0387077) and C18-modified vitamin D compounds (EP-A-0521550), 
preferably also hydroxylated in the 1α-position and optionally in the 
C17-side chain. Other modifications of the C17-side chain have been 
proposed, likewise to improve the intended activity and to suppress 
detrimental side-effects. Examples of modifications of the C17-side chain 
are chain elongations (homo compounds), 22-oxa modifications, fluor 
substitutions, epoxy groups (e.g. WO 92/21695), etc. In addition certain 
24-cyclopropyl-modified vitamin D compounds are disclosed in literature, 
e.g. in WO 87/00834 (for treating abnormal cell differentiation and 
proliferation) and in an article by Farach-Carson et al. in 
Endocrinology 1991, 129, 1876-84. Generally, however, the above C17-side 
chain modified vitamin D compounds are still not completely satisfactory 
as regards their selective activity, i.e. the intended benificial 
activity without detrimental side-effects.  
 Further, the accessibility of the C17-side chain modified vitamin D 
compounds is often insufficient or unattractive. As an example, the 
preparation of the above vitamin D compound disclosed by Farach-Carson 
et al, seems very laborious, while the C17-side chain build-up,
