<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating on a workpiece comprises 
offering a probe (24) of material harder than the workpiece 

material to a continuous or substantially continuous 
surface of the workpiece, the probe depending from a 

containment member having a surface which faces the 
workpiece. Relative cyclic movement is caused between the 

probe (24) and the workpiece while urging the probe and 
workpiece together whereby frictional heat is generated as 

the probe enters the workpiece so as to create a 
plasticised region in the workpiece material around the 

probe, the containment member substantially preventing 
dispersal of the plasticised material. The cyclic movement 

is stopped and the plasticised material allowed to solidify 
around the probe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for operating on a 
workpiece. Friction welding has been known for many years and 
typically involves causing relative movement between a pair 
of workpieces while they are urged together so as to 
generate a plasticised region, stopping the relative 
movement and allowing the plasticised region to solidify 
thereby joining the workpieces. It has also been proposed in the past to join 
workpieces by making use of a "non-consumable" member which 
does not form part of the finished joint. An example of 
this approach is shown in US-A-4144110 in which the two 
workpieces are urged together about a rotating wheel which 
causes the plasticised region to be generated. The two 
workpieces are also translated relative to the wheel so 
that they are welded together along a joint region. In accordance with the present invention, a method of 
operating on a workpiece comprises offering a probe of 
material harder than the workpiece material to a continuous 
or substantially continuous surface of the workpiece, the 
probe depending from a containment member having a surface 
which faces the workpiece; causing relative cyclic movement 
between the probe and the workpiece while urging the probe 
and workpiece together whereby frictional heat is generated 
as the probe enters the workpiece so as to create a 
plasticised region in the workpiece material around the 
probe the containment member substantially preventing 
dispersal of the plasticised material; stopping the 
relative cyclic movement; and allowing the plasticised 
material to solidify around the probe. This new technique, which we refer to as "friction 
plunge welding" provides a very simple method of joining a 
probe to a workpiece. The method can be used for repairing 
cracks and the like within a workpiece or for joining 
members, such as studs or bushes, to a workpiece.  Preferably, at least part of the probe which enters 
the workpiece is shaped, for example tapered, so as to key 
into the solidified material. The material of the workpiece can be metals, alloys or 
compound materials such as MMC, or suitable plastic 
materials such as thermo-plastics. In some examples, the probe has an elongate axis and 
undergoes cyclic movement, for example a reciprocating 
movement, in a direction generally parallel with its 
elongate axis. The probe is then left in situ. In all these methods, the probe may have a 
substantially circular cross-section. In another example the probe is in the form of a 
slightly tapering cylinder so
