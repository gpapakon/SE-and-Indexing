<ABSTRACT>
This device includes at least one transformer (9, 10, 11) supplied, at its primary (9) by a three-phase alternating current and delivering, on at least one secondary (10, 11), a three-phase current applied to rectifying means delivering, as output to the load, a rectified voltage and current, these rectifying means being of the type including, for each secondary, controlled semiconductor devices (15, 16). According to the invention, the rectifying means comprise a free-running circuit (19), the said controlled semiconductor devices being triggered with firing angles which are essentially variable, these being modified so as to increase the conduction period in the free-running circuit while at the same time decreasing the conduction period in the triggered semiconductor devices, and conversely, thus making it possible to deliver, to the load, an active power or a reactive power which is substantially constant despite variations in the impedance of the load.

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling a power converter device for supplying direct
current to an arc furnace (4), the device being of the type comprising at least

one transformer (9, 10, 11) with its primary (9) fed with a three-phase
alternating current and delivering to at least one secondary a three-phase

current applied to rectifier means outputting to the load a rectified voltage
(V
arc
) and current (I
arc
), said rectifier means comprising a freewheel circuit,
and being of the type comprising controlled semiconductors for each

secondary, said device being characterized in that said controlled
semiconductors are triggered with essentially variable firing angles (α
1
, α
2
)
which are modified so as to increase the duration of conduction in the

freewheel circuit whilst reducing correspondingly the duration of conduction in
the triggered semiconductors, and vice versa, so as to deliver to the load a

substantially constant active power (P) and/or reactive power despite the
variations in impedance of the load.
A method of controlling a converter according to claim 1, in the case of a
transformer including at least two secondaries (10, 11), characterized in that

the respective rectifier means fed by the secondaries are combined in an
"offset" arrangement, with respective firing-control angles α
1
 and α
2
 such that
α
1
 ≠ α
2
.
A method of controlling a converter according to claim 2, characterized in
that the firing-control angles α
1
 and α
2
 are chosen, for a given operating point,
so as to minimize the reactive power consumption, the resulting mean value

over an operating cycle then being minimal.
A method of controlling a converter according to claim 2, characterized in
that the firing-control angles α
1
 and α
2
 are chosen, for a given rectified current
(Id), so as to minimize variations, in particular in the form of flicker, in the

reactive power about its mean value (Q).
A method of controlling a converter according to claim 2, characterized in
that means are provided for cyclically permutating the offset directions of the

control angles α
1
 and α
2
 of the two rectifier means respectively.
