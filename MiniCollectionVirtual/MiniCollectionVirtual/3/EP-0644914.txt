 or corresponding
mixed oxides thereof, the refractive index of the

particles being adapted to the refractive index of the
organic matrix according to the use.
Process according to Claim 1 for the
production of optical, electro-optical and

optoelectronic components.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the fillers used are particles which are

modified on the surface by covalently bonded organic
groups.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the particles used as fillers are bonded

covalently in the polymer material.
Optically homogeneous, highly transparent or
highly light-scattering shaped articles which can be

produced by a process according to Claims 1-4,
characterized in that the refractive index of the

fillers is adapted to that of the matrix according to
the use. 
Optically homogeneous, highly transparent or
highly light-scattering embedding compositions which

can be produced by a process according to Claims 1-4,
characterized in that the refractive index of the

fillers is adapted to that of the matrix according to
the use.
