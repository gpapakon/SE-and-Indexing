<ABSTRACT>
Object:

 
To eliminate inconveniences arising from the porosity of a SIPOS 

film or the loose bonding of oxygen and Si atoms when a field 
plate comprising a SIPOS film (11) is sandwiched by oxide films 

(13; 14) to reduce stress of the field plate. 
Constitution:

 
When the surface layer is thermally oxidized to form an oxide 

film (14) as a top layer after a SIPOS film (11) is formed, the 
SIPOS film will be dense and its film quality will be uniform. 

To prevent this thermal oxidization process from affecting the 
depth of an impurity diffusion layer and a gate oxide film, a 

SIPOS film and both oxide films are formed immediately after a 
field oxide film is formed. After this process, an impurity 

diffusion layer and a gate oxide film are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device 
including a field plate on a semiconductor substrate to maintain 
reliability of high voltage devices and a manufacturing method. Thin films of semi-insulating polycrystalline silicon 
(SIPOS) have conventionally been used as resistive field plate 
films to maintain reliability of high voltage devices, in particular, 
those of a MOS type structure. The SIPOS thin film is generally an oxygen-containing 
polycrystalline silicon film formed at a 
substrate temperature of 650° C by a CVD method using SiH₄ 
and N₂O, and the concentration of oxygen atoms in SIPOS is 
about 25%. Figures 2 and 3 show examples of a semiconductor 
device having such a field plate. These semiconductor 
devices are bipolar transistors wherein a P base region 2 is 
formed on the surface layer of a N⁻ silicon substrate 1, an 
N⁺ emitter region 3 is selectively formed thereon, and a N⁺ 
collector layer 4 is formed on the rear surface of the 
substrate and which have Al electrodes 5 and 6 that contact 
the P region 2 and N+ region 3 respectively to act as base 
and emitter electrodes as well as a three-layer film  
 
electrode 71, Ti-Ni-Ag, that contacts the under lying N⁺ layer 
to act as a collector electrode. A SIPOS thin film 11 on 
the field plate contacts the emitter electrode 6, the base 
electrode 5, and an N+ peripheral region 8 located in the 
periphery of the substrate, and is provided between the 
base electrode 5 and a peripheral electrode 9 of a 
potential equal to that of the electrode 71. In Figure 2, 
the SIPOS thin film 11 0.5 µm in thickness that also serves 
to protect the surface is formed directly on the surface of 
the drift region of an N⁻ silicon substrate 1, and an SiO₂ 
film 12 1 µm in thickness is formed thereon by a CVD 
method. In Figure 3, the SIPOS thin film 11 is formed via a 
thermally oxidized film 13 1 µm in thickness that serves to 
protect the surface, and the CVD SiO₂ film 12 is coated 
thereon. As MIMURA et al. have reported in IEEE Electron Device 
Let. Vol. ED-6, No. 4, p. 189 (1985), compared with the 
structure in Figure 3, the structure in Figure 2 has 
disadvantages in that a large leakage current is generated near 
junctions and that hFe is small. Thus, the structure in 
Figure 3 is presently used for every application. When it 
comes to practical use, however, the structure in Figure 3 
also exhibits disadvantages in that a leakage current is not 
uniform, that the structure has temperature characteristics, 
and that cracks may
