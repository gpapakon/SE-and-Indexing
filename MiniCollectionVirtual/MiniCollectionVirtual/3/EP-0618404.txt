<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for generating steam in a district heating power station by evaporating feed water in a combustion boiler, feeding back the heating steam and condensing it after heat dissipation and reutilising it as feed water. A fraction of the heat content of the flue gases of the combustion boiler is fed via an economiser to the feed water, and the flue gases are guided via a flue gas cleaning system. The invention also relates to an installation for carrying out the method. The object of the invention is to develop a method and an installation which render it possible to ensure effective steam generation in conjunction with maximum heat utilisation by the installed heating surfaces, and at the same time to ensure preheating of the exhaust air and of the flue gas during start up and shut down operations. The object is achieved by means of a method for generating steam in a district heating power station and an installation for carrying out this method. In this case, before entering an economiser (2) the feed water is set up in terms of quantity and temperature in a manner independent of a feed water requirement of the combustion boiler (1), but dependent on the temperature regime in the economiser (2). In the case in which the temperature on the surface of the economiser (2) on the exhaust gas side is below the dew point of the exhaust gas, the temperature of the feed water and the feed water throughput are set by the economiser (2) in such a way that a temperature is set up on the surface of the economiser (2) on the exhaust gas side which is above the dew point. If the temperature of the feed water in the economiser (2) has reached the boiling range, in accordance with the invention the feed water throughput through the economiser (2) is increased above the quantity necessary for the required steam power, while a proportion of the feed water reemerging from the economiser (2) is fed back, cooled and recirculated before entering a drum (24) of the combustion boiler (1).

A process of producing steam in a heat and power 
station by evaporating feedwater in a combustion tank 

(1), by condensing the hot steam and returning the 
condensate after heat release and re-use as feedwater, 

with part of the heat content of the flue gasses(6) of 
the combustion tank (1) being added, via an economiser 

(2), to the feedwater whose flow rate and temperature, 
prior to entering the economiser (2), are adjusted 

independently of the feedwater requirements (4) of the 
combustion tank (1) in such a way that the surface 

temperature of the economiser is held at a value which 
is higher than the dew point of the exhaust gas,
 
characterised in
 
that, under normal operating conditions of the 

combustion tank (1), when the feedwater temperature in 
the economiser (2) increases and reaches the boiling 

range, the feedwater throughput in the economiser (2) is 
increased and that after the feedwater has left the 

economiser (2), part of the feedwater quantity is 
circulated, with said part of the feedwater, before 

entering a drum (24) of the combustion tank (1), for 
cooling purposes, being fed into an expander (16) of a 

feedwater degassing container (9) or into an expander 
(16a) of a condensate container and thereafter being 

returned to the economiser (2). 
A process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the temperature of the feedwater is set as a 

function of the temperature regime in the economiser (2) 
in a feedwater preheater (8a).  

 
A process according to any one of claims 1 and 2,
 
characterised in
 
that, when the combustion tank (1) stops operating, a 

certain feedwater quantity is circulated, with the 
feedwater, prior to entering the economiser (2), being 

heated in the feedwater preheater (8a) to a temperature 
which permits the flue gasses and exhaust air in front 

of the following flue gas cleansing system (21) to be 
heated to a temperature which is above the dew point of 

the flue gasses and exhaust air and that the feedwater, 
after having left the economiser (2), is returned to the 

feedwater preheater (8a) and then again to the 
economiser (2). 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in
 
that prior to starting the combustion tank (1), first 

a certain feedwater quantity is circulated, with the 
feedwater, prior to entering the economiser (2), being 

heated in the feedwater preheater (8, 8a) to 
approximately 130 Â°C; with the feedwater, after having 

left the economiser (2),being returned to the feedwater 
preheater (8, 8a) and then again to the economiser (2); 

and that, after an exhaust air temperature which 
corresponds to the respective dew point of the exhaust 

gas has been exceeded, the combustion tank (1) is 
started. 
A device for producing steam in a heat and power 
station by evaporating feedwater, consisting of a 

combustion tank (1) which is connected to a condensate 
collecting container (10) with a condensate inlet (13), 

to a condensate pump (12), a feedwater preheater (8a) 
and an economiser (2) to form a circulation-type system, 

and further consisting of a gas cleansing system (21) 
for the flue gasses extracted from the combustion tank 

(1),
 
characterised in
  
 

that there is provided an additional recirculation 
circuit (7, 7a) by means of which part of the heated 

feedwater, through a feedwater removing valve (6) and a 
recirculation valve (15), reaches an expander (16, 16a) 

and thereafter a feedwater degassing container (9) 
and/or a condensate collecting container (10), with the 

recirculated feedwater being returned into the 
economiser (2) through the condensate pump (12), the 

feedwater preheater (8a) and the feedwater regulating 
valve (14). 
A device according to claim 5,
 
characterised in
 
that the diameter of the expander (16, 16a) and the 

number and dimensions of the steam exit nozzles (17, 
17a) and of the water exit bores (18, 18a) are 

calculated in such a way that the water level in the 
expander (16, 16a) permits safe separation of the 

condensate and expanding steam.
