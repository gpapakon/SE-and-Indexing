<ABSTRACT>
Device (20) for the internal cleaning and clearing of tubular bodies for medical use insertable in the human body, particularly endotracheal tubes, drainage tubes, urethral catheters and probes, or the like. The device is insertable in the tubular body (2) to be cleaned and is constituted by an inner rod (21) and an outer sheath (22) which are movable with respect to each other and can cause the radial expansion of a cleaning element (30) connected between the inner rod (21) and the outer sheath (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
DEVICE FOR THE INTERNAL CLEANING AND CLEARING OF TUBULAR BODIES FOR MEDICAL USE WHICH ARE INSERTABLE IN HUMAN BODIESTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a device for the internal cleaning and clearing of tubular bodies for medical use which are insertable in human bodies, particularly endotracheal tubes, drainage tubes, urethral probes and catheters, and the like.Background ArtAs is known, endotracheal tubes are substantially constituted by a tubular portion having, at its outward end, means for connection for example to the respirator and, proximate to its inward end, a membrane which can be inflated by means of a tube connected to the outside; this membrane in practice locates the inward end of the tube and creates, so to speak, the outward seal with regard to the inspired and expired air.It has been observed that in patients intubated even for a short time the endotracheal tubes tend to clog due to the more or less dense secretions which deposit inside the tubes.Deposition of the secretions within the endotracheal tube causes an immediate increase in inspiratory and expiratory resistances, due to the narrowing of the useful flow section.The solutions currently adopted to restore the useful flow section are in practice constituted by swab-like elements which are inserted in the endotracheal tube to remove the secretions present on the walls.However, this solution sends the secretions toward the 

patient, since during the insertion of the swab-like element most of the secretions are pushed toward the inside of the patient's trachea.Therefore, in many cases it is necessary to replace the endotracheal tube, performing extubation of the patient and subsequent re-intubation thereof with a fresh tube; this operation first of all requires the presence of a physician and is furthermore not pleasant for the patient.Disclosure of the InventionThe aim of the present invention is indeed to solve the problem described above by providing a device for the internal cleaning and clearing of tubular bodies for medical use to be inserted in human bodies, particularly but not exclusively for endotracheal tubes, which allows to remove even the densest and hardest secretions present on the internal walls of the tubular body rapidly and simply without external contaminations and most of all avoiding extubation of the patient.Within the scope of the above aim, a particular object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning device which is in practice constituted by a disposable kit which allows to operate

 CLAIMS
1. Device (20) for the internal cleaning of tubular bodies for medical use which are insertable in human bodies, particularly endotracheal tubes, drainage tubes, urethral catheters and probes, or the like, characterized in that it comprises an inner rod (21) and an outer sheath (22) which are insertable in the tubular body (2) to be cleaned and are movable with respect to each other to cause the radial expansion of a cleaning element (30) connected between said inner rod (21) and said outer sheath (22). 2. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said inner rod (21) and said outer sheath (22) are made of relatively flexible materials, said inner rod (21) having a grip eyelet (23) and said sheath (22) being provided with a handgrip (24) to perform the relative translatory motion between said inner rod and said outer sheath. 3. Device according to the preceding claims, characterized in that said cleaning element (30) is constituted by a cylindrical tubular braiding (31) formed by interwoven wires which are respectively connected to said inner rod (21) and to said outer sheath (22) at the axial ends of said cylindrical tubular braiding (31). 4. Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that said tubular braiding (31) is suitable to be expanded radially until it engages the internal walls of said tubular body (2) . 5. Device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises a tubular bag (40) which can be applied at the inlet (12) of said tubular
