<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for making an intravascular 
stent by applying to the body of a stent a solution which 

comprises a solvent, a polymer dissolved in the solvent and a 
therapeutic substance dispersed in the solvent and then 

evaporating the solvent. The inclusion of a polymer in intimate 
contact with a drug on the stent allows the drug to be retained 

on the stent during expansion of the stent and also controls the 
administration of drug following implantation. The adhesion of 

the coating and the rate at which the drug is delivered can be 
controlled by the selection of an appropriate bioabsorbable or 

biostable polymer and the ratio of drug to polymer in the 
solution. By this method, drugs such as dexamethasone can be 

applied to a stent, retained on a stent during expansion of the 
stent and elute at a controlled rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intravascular stents for
treatment of injuries to blood vessels and particularly to stents
having a framework onto which a therapeutic substance or drug is
applied.Although angioplasty procedures have increased greatly in
popularity for treatment of occluded arteries, the problem of
restenosis following the angioplasty treatment remains a
significant problem. Restenosis is the closure of a peripheral
or coronary artery following trauma to the artery caused by
efforts to open an occluded portion of the artery by angioplasty,
such as, for example, by balloon dilation, atherectomy or laser
ablation treatment of the artery. For these angioplasty
procedures, restenosis occurs at a rate of about 30-60% depending
upon the vessel location, lesion length and a number of other
variables.One aspect of restenosis may be simply mechanical; e.g.
caused by the elastic rebound of the arterial wall and/or by
dissections in the vessel wall caused by the angioplasty
procedure. These mechanical problems have been successfully
addressed by the use of stents to tack-up dissections and prevent
elastic rebound of the vessel, thereby reducing the level of
restenosis for many patients. The stent is typically inserted by
catheter into a vascular lumen and expanded into contact with the
diseased portion of the arterial wall, thereby providing internal
support for the lumen. Examples of stents which have been
successfully applied over a PTCA balloon and radially expanded at
the same time as the balloon expansion of an affected artery
include the stents disclosed in US-A-4733665 (Palmaz), US-A-4800882
(Gianturco) and US-A-4886062 (Wiktor) which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.Another aspect of restenosis is believed to be a natural
healing reaction to the injury of the arterial wall that is
caused by angioplasty procedures. The final result of the 
complex steps of the healing process is intimal hyperplasia, the
migration and proliferation of medial smooth muscle cells, until
the artery is again occluded.To address both aspects of the restenosis problem, it has
been proposed to provide stents which are seeded with endothelial
cells (see Dichek,D.A. et al. "Seeding of Intravascular Stents
With Genetically Engineered Endothelial Cells", Circulation 80:
1347-1353 (1989)). In that experiment, sheep endothelial cells
that had undergone retrovirus-mediated gene transfer for either
bacterial beta-galactosidase or human tissue-type plasminogen
activator were seeded onto stainless steel stents
