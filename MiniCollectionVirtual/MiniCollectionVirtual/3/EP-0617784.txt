<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a heat 
exchanger for an automotive vehicle. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a heat exchanger of the plate-fin 
type wherein each of the plates includes a plurality of 
bead configurations having different heights. Plate-fin heat exchangers are well known in the art. 
In these types of heat exchangers, a plurality of elongate 
plates are joined together, such as through a lamination 
process to define a plurality of passageways for movement of 
a fluid therethrough. Each of the passageways is formed by 
the inwardly facing surfaces of a pair of joined plates. 
The interior surfaces of the joined plates generally define 
a central fluid conducting section. The passageways are 
interconnected so that a fluid may flow through the 
plurality of joined plates forming the heat exchanger. As 
is also known in the art, conductive fin strips are located 
between outwardly facing surfaces of the pairs of joined 
plates. Heat exchangers of this type have particular 
utility as evaporators for air conditioning systems in motor 
vehicles. Various plate designs have been proposed for improving 
the heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger. The 
heat transfer coefficient can be improved by establishing a 
multiplicity of pathways for the fluid to flow through so 
that a greater turbulence and a greater mixing of a fluid to 
be cooled is obtained. One such proposed plate design is 
shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,600,053, assigned to the assignee 
of the present invention. The plate of the '053 patent 
includes a plurality of beads formed on each of the pair of 
plates forming one of the passageways of the fluid in the 
heat exchanger. The laminated plates include two distinct 
varieties of beads. A first variety of the beads extends 
above the surface of the plate and terminates in a flat 
upper surface. The second variety of beads extends above 
the surface of the laminated plate and terminates in a  
 
curved upper surface. The first and second variety of beads 
are arranged so that when a pair of the plates are laminated 
together, the first variety of beads on one of the plates is 
in bonding contact with the second variety of beads on the 
other of the pair of plates. In this manner, the heat 
exchanger has a plurality of flow paths established for the 
fluid in each of the passageways. However, in assembling a 
pair of plates to be joined, alignment of the plates could 
be difficult due to slippage between the plates at the 
points of contact
