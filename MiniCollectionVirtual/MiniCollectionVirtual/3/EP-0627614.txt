<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of oscillating-piston liquid meters. The subject of the invention is a cylindrical chamber (1) which includes, in particular, a double concave fixed partition wall (9) and grooves on the bottom and/or top edges of the piston and, possibly, on the small cylinders of the chamber 1. The invention applies to liquid metering and, more particularly, to water metering.

<CLAIMS>
A cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston comprising a side 
wall (6), a base (7), a lid (8), a fixed partition (9) made of rigid material and enclosing a 

piston (2) held along the said fixed partition by the edges (10) of a vertical scallop (4) 
opening at the level of a plane partition (3) of the said piston into an aperture (5), at 

least two ports being housed in the cylindrical chamber, characterised in that the 
profile of the edges (10) of the scallop (4) is in the form of an arc and in that the profile 

of the fixed partition (9) is double concave. 
Cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to claim 
1, characterised in that the profile of the fixed partition (9) is defined by all the points C 

of the segment AC at right-angles to the segment AB, where A, B and C belong to the 
plane formed by the plane partition (3), A belongs to the median plane of the fixed 

partition (9), B to the cylinder generated by rotation of the axis of the piston (2), the 
segment AB having a length equal to the radius of the piston and the segment AC to 

half at most of the width of the scallop. 
Cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to claim 
2, characterised in that the length of the segment AC is equal to half the width of the 

scallop (4). 
Cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to claim 
1, characterised in that the chamber comprises at least one small concentric cylinder 

(11 or 12) and in that the plane partition (3) of the piston (2) comprises at least one 
central projection. 
Cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that at least one of the lower or upper edges of the 

piston comprises a groove (19, 20). 
Cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to one of  
 

claims 4 or 5, characterised in that at least one small cylinder (11, 12) comprises a 
groove (21, 22) on its edge facing the plane partition (3). 
Cylindrical chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to one of 
claims 5 or 6, characterised in that the profile of the grooves is in the form of an arc. 
Liquid counter with oscillating piston characterised in that it comprises a cylindrical 
chamber of a liquid counter with an oscillating piston according to one of the 

preceding claims.
