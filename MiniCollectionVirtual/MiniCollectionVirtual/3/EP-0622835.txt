<ABSTRACT>
A laminated layer having a layer containing Al (In) 
and a layer not containing Al (In) alternately laminated one 

upon another is plasma etched by an etchant gas which can etch 
both the layers containing an
d not containing Al (In). An 
additive gas containing F is added to the etchant gas while a 

layer not containing Al (In) is etched. When the surface of 
the layer containing Al (In) is exposed, fluorides are formed 

on the surface of the layer containing Al (In) and the etching 
is automatically stopped. An emission peak specific to Al 

(In) is monitored to detect which layer is presently etched.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an etching method
which can be used to manufacture
a semiconductor device having a heterojunction compound
semiconductor laminated layer.There are various kinds of compound semiconductor
devices having a heterojunction compound semiconductor
laminated layer. For example, a heterojunction FET (HFET),
including a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is
one kind of field effect transistor (FET), It has a
heterojunction at an interface between a compound
semiconductor layer (two dimensional electron/hole carrier
transport channel) having a relatively narrow band gap and
another compound semiconductor barrier layer (in the case of
HEMT, impurity doped carrier supply layer) having a relatively
wide band gap.A narrow potential valley is formed in the carrier
transport channel layer adjacent the interface with the
barrier layer and provides a transport channel for two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG). A HEMT has a barrier layer 
doped with n-type impurities and a carrier transport channel
which is non-doped or lightly doped with n-type impurities.
Even when the barrier layer is non-doped, a carrier transport
channel for 2DEG is formed. When carriers are supplied, e.g.
from the source electrode, a current is allowed to flow.
Although higher mobility is made possible by lowering the
impurity concentration in the carrier transport layer, the
carrier transport layer may be doped. Positive holes can also
be used as carriers. The term "HFET" stands for HEMT-like
transistors including these variations.When forming a complementary HFET (HEMT) circuit
effective for a low power consumption, generally, an n-channel
carrier transport channel and a barrier layer and a p-channel
carrier transport channel and a barrier layer are laminated together.When forming a transistor using underlying
semiconductor layers, upper semiconductor layers are etched.
For the mass production of integrated semiconductor circuits,
it is necessary to control precisely the amount of etching in
order that the semiconductor elements have uniform properties.Figs. 8A to 8C of the accompanying drawings are schematic cross
sectional views illustrating a conventional method of manufacturing a
complementary HFET, which is a so-called HEMT.As shown in Fig.8A, an i-type GaAs layer 82, a p-type
AlGaAs layer 83, an i-type GaAs layer 84, an n-type
AlGaAs layer 85, and an i-type GaAs layer 86 are laminated in
this order on a semiinsulating GaAs wafer 81, by metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).As shown in Fig.8B, a
