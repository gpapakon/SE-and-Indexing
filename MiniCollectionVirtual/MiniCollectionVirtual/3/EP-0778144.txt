<ABSTRACT>
A refill kit (200) is provided with a variable volume 
refill reservoir (202) for containing a quantity of ink and a 

hollow needle (204) in fluid communication with the reservoir. To 
refill an ink supply (20), the hollow needle (204) is inserted 

through a port (52), (206) in the ink supply and the variable volume 
refill reservoir( 202) is compressed to urge the ink within the 

refill kit into the ink supply. A septum (54), (208) within the port 
seals the port when the needle is withdrawn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kit for refilling an ink supply for
an ink-jet printer and to a method of using the kit to refill an ink supply.A typical ink-jet printer has a print head mounted to a carriage
which is moved back and forth over a printing surface, such as a piece of
paper. As the print head passes over appropriate locations on the printing
surface, a control system activates ink jets on the print head to eject, or jet,
ink drops onto the printing surface and form desired images and characters.To work properly, such printers must have a reliable supply of ink
for the print head. Many ink-jet printers use a disposable ink pen that can be
mounted to the carriage. Such an ink pen typically includes, in addition to the
print head, a reservoir containing a supply of ink. The ink pen also typically
includes pressure regulating mechanisms to maintain the ink supply at an
appropriate pressure for use by the print head. When the ink supply is
exhausted, the ink pen is disposed of and a new ink pen is installed. This
system provides an easy, user friendly way of providing an ink supply for an
ink-jet printer.Other types of ink-jet printers use ink supplies that are separate
from the print head and are not mounted to the carriage. Such ink supplies,
because they are stationary within the printer, are not subject to all of the size
limitations of an ink supply that is moved with the carriage. Some printers
with stationary ink supplies have a refillable ink reservoir built into the
printer. Ink is supplied from the reservoir to the print head through a tube
which trails from the print head. Alternatively, the print head can include a
small ink reservoir that is periodically replenished by moving the print head to
a filling station at the stationary, built-in reservoir. In either alternative, ink 
may be supplied from the reservoir to the print head by either a pump within the
printer or by gravity flow.Still other ink-jet printers use replaceable reservoirs that are separate
from the print head. These reservoirs, like the built-in reservoirs are not located
on the carriage and, thus, are not moved with the print head during printing.
Replaceable reservoirs are often plastic bags filled with ink. The bag is
provided with a mechanism, such as a septum which can be punctured by a
hollow needle, for coupling it to the printer so that ink may flow from the bag to
the print head. Often, the bag is squeezed, or pressurized in some other
manner, to cause the ink to flow from the reservoir.Once depleted,

A method of refilling an ink reservoir (24) of an ink-jet printer, the ink
reservoir having a port (52) with an internal diameter sized to allow introduction

of ink into the ink reservoir, the port having a plug (54) initially present within the
port internal diameter which forms a seal at the port (52), the method comprising the

steps of:

providing a variable volume refill reservoir (202) containing a quantity of

ink;
providing a hollow needle (204) having a first end and an opposing
second end which define a needle length therebetween, the first end being

connected to the refill reservoir, the opposing second end being appropriately
shaped for receipt within the port;
inserting the needle (204) into the port to push (54) the plug into the ink reservoir
and thus break the seal formed by the plug and create a fluid pathway from the

refill reservoir to the ink reservoir;
compressing the refill reservoir (202) to urge ink from the refill reservoir through
the fluid pathway and into the ink reservoir;
providing a septum (208) carried on the hollow needle (204) between the first
end and opposing second end thereof for resealing the port,
positioning the septum within the port during the inserting step; and
leaving the septum (208) within the port as the needle is withdrawn from the
port to thereby seal the port.
A refill kit (200) for use with the method according to claim 1, the refill kit
comprising:


a variable volume refill reservoir (202) containing a quantity of ink;
a hollow needle (204) having a first end and an opposing second end
which define a needle length therebetween, the first end being connected to the

refill reservoir, the opposing second end of the needle being appropriately
shaped for receipt within the ink reservoir port (52), the needle length being appropriately sized 

for dislodging a plug (54) present in the port internal diameter to establish a fluid
pathway from the refill reservoir, through the needle, and into the ink reservoir,

and
a septum (208) removably carried on an exterior surface between the first
end and the second opposing end of the hollow needle (204), the septum (208) being of an

appropriate diameter to be received within the port (52) as the hollow needle is
inserted and to be left within the port as the needle is withdrawn from the port.
A refill kit (200) used to refill an ink reservoir of an ink-jet printer, the ink

the port, the refill kit comprising:

a hollow needle (204) having a first end and an opposing second end
