<ABSTRACT>
Sod fuel peat is crushed in a pin crushing drum plant 3 
which produces crushed sod turf which is screened to 

provide nodules of peat, at least 50%, and preferably 
approximately 72% w/w of the nodules having an average 

dimension of between 10 mm and 20 mm. The nodules have a 
bulk density at 50% moisture content of at least 400 Kg/mÂ³. 

The nodules are a highly effective biofiltration medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a biofiltration medium and in
particular to a biofiltration medium based on peat.Biofiltration is a method of treatment for cleaning gas
streams originating from a number of industrial and waste
treatment activities. The removal of odorous components
from the gas takes place by the activity of microorganisms
(mainly bacteria) which are present on an
organic carrier material or medium.Waste gases are passed via ducting into a space located
beneath or above the filter medium. As the gas passes
through the filter the odorous compounds are absorbed onto
an aqueous layer and are degraded by microorganisms which
reside within the organic filter material. The end-products
of the oxidation process are odourless compounds,
mainly carbon dioxide, water, nitrates and sulphates.Oxidation restores the absorption capacity of the filter
material and provides the microorganisms with the
nutrients necessary for their survival and growth. Thus
the entire biofiltration process is self generating.One of the main advantages of biofiltration in comparison
with other techniques is that many chemically different
compounds can be eliminated with a high degree of
efficiency due to the adaptation of the microorganisms to
the compounds present in the gas stream. Biofilters
require little maintenance and have low energy
requirements. The running costs of biological odour
treatment technologies have been found to be 2-10 times
lower than for other treatment methods. As there are no 
secondary disposal problems, biofiltration is the most
"environmentally friendly" option for odour control.Biofiltration is a proven odour control technology for a
number of applications as described in the VDI guideline
of biofilters 3477 (1991).Biofiltration of gases is a result of physical, chemical
and biological processes. The main physical process are
adsorption and absorption. Malodorous compounds are
adsorbed onto the filter medium and absorbed onto the
layer of water surrounding the medium. The chemical
reactions that take place on the surface of the
biofiltration medium include precipitation, ion exchange
and chemisorption. The biological processes are the
breaking down of waste gases by microorganisms.The efficiency of a biofilter depends on a large number of
factors. One of the main factors is the biofiltration
medium that is used in the biofilter.More particularly, the invention relates to a
biofiltration medium comprising discrete units consisting
of peat.EP-A-413638 describes a biofiltration medium of this type
in
