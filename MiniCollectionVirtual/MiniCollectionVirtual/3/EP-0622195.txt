responsive to the transconductance amplifier, a first 

comparator circuit (31,41) responsive to the output of the 
cascaded bandpass amplifiers for providing an output 

pursuant to optical sensing of a first minimum ink drop 
size, and a second comparator circuit (32,42) responsive 

to the output of the cascaded bandpass amplifiers for 
providing an output pursuant to optical sensing of a second 

minimum ink drop size.

<DESCRIPTION>
The disclosed invention is directed generally to an
optical drop detect, and more particularly to an optical
drop detect that is capable of detecting relatively small
drops of two different sizes.Optical drop detect circuits are utilized in ink jet
printers for various purposes including testing of the
operation of ink drop firing nozzles of a printhead and
determination of the relative positions of the nozzle
arrays of multiple printheads. Optical drop detect circuits
typically include a light sensor such as a photodiode
which senses the light provided by a light source such as
an LED. When a drop is present in the light path between
the light sensor and the light source, the output of the
light sensor changes since the amount of light sensed by
the light sensor is reduced by the presence of the ink
drop. The output of the light sensor is typically amplified
and analyzed to determine whether an ink drop passed
through the light path between the light source and the
light sensor.Considerations with known optical drop detect circuits
include their inability to reliably detect relatively small
sizes of ink drops, and the inability to reliably detect a
plurality of different sizes of relatively small ink drops. It would therefore be an advantage to provide an
optical drop detect circuit for reliably detecting relatively
small sizes of ink drops.Another advantage would be to provide an optical drop
detect circuit for reliably detecting different sizes of
relatively small ink drops.The foregoing and other advantages are provided by the
invention in an optical drop detect circuit that includes
a transconductance amplifier responsive to the output of an
optical detecting element, a bandpass amplifier circuit
that is tuned to match the bandwidth of the output of the
optical detecting element, a first comparator responsive to
the output of the bandpass amplifier circuit for providing
a first comparator output that is indicative of when the
bandpass output decreases below a first predetermined
threshold, and a second comparator means for providing a
second comparator output indicative of when that bandpass
output decreases below a second predetermined threshold,
whereby sensing of a drop having a size at least as large
as a first minimum drop size is indicated by the first
comparator output and sensing of a drop having a size at
least as large as a second minimum drop size is indicated
by the second comparator output.The advantages and features of the disclosed invention
will readily be appreciated by persons
