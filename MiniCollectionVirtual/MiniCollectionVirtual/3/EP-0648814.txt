<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polarizing film
containing dye.Currently, polarizing films are generally prepared
by incorporating iodine or a dichromatic dye as a
polarizing element into an oriented film made of polyvinyl
alcohol or its derivatives, or into an oriented polyene film
prepared by dehydrochlorination of a polyvinyl chloride
film or dehydration of a polyvinyl alcohol film so as to
produce polyene in the film, followed by the orientation of
the resulting film.Among those, an iodine-containing polarizing film is
good in early stage polarizing activities, but poor in the
durability to moisture and heat. Thus, the film has some
drawbacks in the lowered polarizing activities after having
been used for a certain period of time at a high
temperature under a highly humid condition. Several methods
for improving the durability have been proposed, in which
the film is treated with formalin or aqueous boric acid
solution, or a polymer film having a low moisture
permeability is employed as a protecting film, but these
methods are not yet fully satisfactory.A dye-containing polarizing film using a
dichromatic dye as a polarizing element is superior in the
durability to moisture and heat as compared with those in
iodine-containing polarizing film, but inferior in the
early stage polarizing activities.If two polarizing films of neutral color containing 
two or more kinds of dichromatic dyes which are superposed
on each other so that those orientation directions meet at
right angles (hereinafter, this state is referred to as "
crossed state") are pervious to light of a specific
wavelength within the visible radiation wavelength region,
particularly from 400 to 700nm, a liquid crystal display
using the two films often shows a color different from the
intended color at dark state.In order to prevent the problem due to the light
breaking through the films, transmittance of the polarizing
films at crossed state (hereinafter, this is referred to as
"cross light transmittance") must be lowered over the
visible radiation wavelength region, particularly from 400
too 700nm.An object of the present invention is to provide a
polarizing film of neutral color containing two or more
kinds of dichromatic dyes which is excellent in the
polarizing activities as well as the durability to moisture
and heat.Other object of the present invention is to provide
a polarizing film of neutral color containing two or more
kinds of dichromatic dyes which is excellent in the
polarizing activity as well as the durability to moisture
and
