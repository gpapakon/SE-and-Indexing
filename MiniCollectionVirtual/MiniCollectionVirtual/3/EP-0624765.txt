<ABSTRACT>
A cryogenic rectification system wherein 
excess pressurized fluid (70,72) produced in a cryogenic 

rectification plant (7) is turboexpanded (9) and used to chill 
feed (100) prior to passing the feed through a prepurifier (5) 

for removal of at least some of the high boiling 
component of the feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cryogenic 
rectification and in particular to the processing of 
the feed passed into the cryogenic rectification. Feed which undergoes cryogenic rectification 
must be first cleaned of high boiling impurities 
because such impurities will freeze at the cryogenic 
temperatures thus burdening the separation. In the cryogenic separation of feed air for 
example, the feed air is cleaned of high boiling 
impurities such as water vapor, carbon dioxide and 
hydrocarbons by passage through a prepurifier such as a 
molecular sieve adsorption unit. The prepurification of the feed is carried 
out more efficiently if the feed is chilled prior to 
prepurification. Chilling the feed condenses out 
water, which reduces the quantity of water adsorbed by 
the prepurifer. This reduces the quantity of the 
adsorbent required and also reduces the regeneration 
energy requirements. Generally, the chilling of the feed prior to 
the prepurificaton is carried out using a mechanical 
chiller or other energy consuming piece of equipment to 
chill or refrigerate the feed. This contributes 
significantly to the operating costs of the cryogenic 
rectification inasmuch as the entire feed must undergo 
the chilling.  Accordingly, it is an object of this 
invention to provide a cryogenic rectification system 
wherein cooling or chilling the feed is carried out in 
a more efficient manner compared with conventional 
cryogenic rectification systems. The above and other objects which will become 
apparent to one skilled in the art upon a reading of 
this disclosure are attained by the present invention, 
one aspect of which is:
 
   A method for carrying out cryogenic 
rectification comprising: 
(A) cooling feed air and thereafter 
prepurifying the cooled feed air; (B) passing prepurified feed air into a 
cryogenic rectification plant and separating the 
prepurified feed air within the cryogenic rectification 
plant into nitrogen-richer fluid and oxygen-richer 
fluid; (C) withdrawing nitrogen-richer fluid from 
the cryogenic rectification plant and passing withdrawn 
nitrogen-richer fluid in indirect heat exchange with 
feed air for cooling the feed air prior to 
prepurification; and (D) turboexpanding at least a portion of the 
withdrawn nitrogen-richer fluid and passing 
turboexpanded nitrogen-richer fluid in indirect heat 
exchange with feed air for cooling the feed air prior 
to prepurification. Another aspect of the invention is:

rectification
