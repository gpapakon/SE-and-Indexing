<ABSTRACT>
A sub-sea oil pipeline installation comprising a production platform (10) and sub-sea facilities (15) at a plurality of wellheads (16), has a data transmission system by which data is transmitted in either direction between the master platform (10) and the sub-sea facilities (15) via communication channels formed by the electrically conducting material of the pipelines (12, 14). The data is transmitted in the form of a VLF or ELF electro-magnetic signal which comprises changes of voltage level oscillating about the DC voltage level of the pipe (12, 14) so that the mean level of the signal is the DC voltage level of the pipe (12, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pipeline system
comprising a metal pipeline having a coating of
insulating material which, in conjuction with
sacrificial anodes electrically connected to the
pipe, provides cathodic protection, there being
signal generating means adapted to be coupled to the
pipeline and operable when so coupled to apply data
to be transmitted in signal from to the pipeline for
conveying along an electrically conducting channel
formed by the metal pipeline.US-A-3129394 discloses the use of a pipeline to
transmit alternating current signals. The pipeline
is not used as a wire or conductor as such. It is
used as the inner conductor of a coaxial cable. The
insulating wrapping (provided for corrosion
protection) provides the dielectric and the ground
surrounding the pipe acts as the other conductor. By
employing the pipe and ground as a co-axial cable,
attenuation is substantially reduced and useful
signals can be transmitted over substantial distances
by amplification of the signal at one or
more intermediate stations. Due to dissipation by
leaks in the pipe wrapping, and other reasons, for
most of the frequency ranges taught it was considered
necessary to use higher output power than most 
communication systems. There is a fear that that
will be undesirable because it will interfere with
the normal direct current cathodic protection of the
pipeline. However the possibility of using signals
in the audio range is hinted at. It is said that the
use of the pipe and surrounding earth as an
alternating current transmission means will not
interfere with the normal direct current cathodic
protection of the pipeline but there is no disclosure
of how this was achieved.US-A-3551890 discloses a system wherein a metal
pipeline forms an electrically conducting channel for
transmission of data, there being signal generating
means adapted to be coupled to the pipeline and
operable when so coupled to apply data to be
transmitted in a signal form to the pipeline for
conveying along the channel. In carrying out the
teachings of that reference data is
transmitted by modulating either the amplitude or the
frequency of an AC carrier signal. We have found
that no useful signal could be detected at the end of
a pipeline which was 4 km long using such a
technique. In practice it is desirable to transmit
data over considerably greater distances than that in
such pipeline installations.An object of this invention is to provide a pipeline
system with means for transmitting data over
considerably greater distances without
