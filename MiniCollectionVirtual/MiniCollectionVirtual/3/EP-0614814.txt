<ABSTRACT>
Operation of presetting the operating conditions of a group of machines 
and devices constituting a system such as a shipping line of products 

can be facilitated. In each of the machines and devices (1-9), provided are a 

storage means (11, 16) for storing the operating conditions of the machines, 
presetting means (13, 14, 18, 19) for presetting the operating conditions of 

the machines and devices, a display means (12, 17) for displaying the operating 
conditions and operating states of the machines and devices, a control 

means (10, 15) for controlling the machines and devices, and a communication 
means (24) for transferring data between the control means (10, 15) of 

the machines and devices. Instead of providing the storage means (11, 16), it 
is allowable to provide a master storage means (33) in part of the machines 

or separately from the machines and devices. By operating one of the presetting 
means (13, 14, 18, 19), the operating condition of the machine and devices 

can be present, and the operating conditions of the other machines and 
devices can be preset via the communication means (24) too.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus integrating system, and
more particularly to a system of integrated apparatus,
including a weighing machine for weighing products such as
food items and industrial machine parts and a packaging
machine for packaging such products, of which the operations
are inter-related such that the operability of each apparatus
of the system is improved.Consider a food shipment line, as an example of such apparatus
integrating system including a weighing machine and a
packaging machine operating in coordination with each other.
Such a system may include a supply conveyer for supplying
materials or incomplete products, a weighing machine for
weighing such materials or products which have been supplied
to it, a packaging machine for packaging them after they are
weighed, a weight checker for checking the weight of packaged
products and removing defective ones if any abnormality is
detected, a boxing apparatus for filling a box with a
specified number of packaged products, and an automated
storage house for sorting and storing boxed products, which
are all operated in a mutually coordinated manner. In a conventional system of this type, each apparatus or
machine which comprises the system has its own control unit,
making it necessary for the user to separately control the
individual apparatus of the system. If these apparatus are
set far apart, or if they are installed on different floors or
levels of a building, for example, the user must travel a long
distance to control the system.In view of the above, Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai 62-103524
disclosed a technology of using a common control unit
to control a weighing machine and a packaging machine which
are intended to be operated in a mutually coordinated manner.
Operation of a system becomes much simpler by such technology
because two machines can be controlled from one control unit.If the common control unit according to this technology is
located somewhere far from the machines to be controlled
thereby, however, the user will find it difficult to perform
fine adjustments on them or to change their control conditions
by running them while watching their conditions of operation.
If the control unit is positioned close to only one of the
machines to be controlled, making adjustments on the other
machine is still troublesome for the same reason. US-A-4757451 describes film folding control apparatus
including a weighing unit for weighing articles and a
wrapping machine. A control unit is provided with each
apparatus but the
