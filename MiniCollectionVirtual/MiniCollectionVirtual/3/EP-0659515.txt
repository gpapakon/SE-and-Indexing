<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gas injection device for forming a controlled atmosphere in a confined space, comprising at least one system of pipework, mounted in series and/or in parallel, at least one pipework portion (2) of which includes gas injection orifices, the said system being supplied by at least one gas inlet pipe (9), each pipe being connected to the system at a primary connection node (8), the design (dimensioning) of the system fulfilling the following relationship:       SIGMA  omega i/ SIGMA  phi i 
>
/= 1, preferably 
>
/= 1.5 where  SIGMA  omega i represents the sum of the internal cross-sections of the gas inlet pipes which supply the system and SIGMA  phi i represents the sum of the cross-sections of the gas injection orifices of the system of pipework.
