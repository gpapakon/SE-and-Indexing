<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for detecting the concentration 
of particles in a liquid (8) includes a light-emitting 

portion (11) for emitting examination light (82) which 
is totally reflected by a boundary surface (80) 

contiguous to the liquid to be examined, a photosensor 
(12) for receiving the totally-reflected light, a 

reference sensor (13) for directly receiving the 
examination light, and a judgment portion (20) for 

finding the reflectance from outputs of the two sensors 
to compute the particle concentration. In case that the 

liquid to be examined is lubricating oil of an engine, 
the concentration of carbon particles is calculated, 

thereby judging the deterioration of the lubricating 
oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oil deterioration
detection apparatus, and also relates to an apparatus
for detecting particles in a liquid.Attempts have heretofore been made to develop
apparatus for detecting the deterioration of lubricating
oil in an internal combustion engine and for telling or
warning the operator (driver) of it. However, oil
deterioration is caused by many factors, and therefore
it has been necessary to detect many judgment indexes
and to judge them synthetically to determine the oil
deterioration. It is desirable to evaluate the
lubricating performance of oil from a plurality of
indexes such, for example, as (1) the production of n-pentane
undissolved components due to the inclusion of
wear powder, sand, fuel and etc., (2) the increase of
viscosity due to the same factors, (3) the increase of
the total acid number due to the development of combustion
products and the oxidation of base oil, and (4) the
reduction of the total basic number due to the consumption
of additives. However, an apparatus capable of
detecting all of these indexes has been found not
practical from the viewpoint of costs.Therefore, relatively simple methods have been
proposed as disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication Nos. 63-266342 (Absorbance measurement
method) and 3-142349 (Impedance measurement method), US-A-4 699 509,
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 61-213749,
Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 62-193549
and Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 3-111741
(Transmittance measurement method). With the
conventional apparatuses, however, the judgment indexes
for oil deterioration have not been proper, and therefore
the warning was too early or too late, and any
apparatus suited for practical use has not yet been
known.Particularly in the type of apparatus using an
optical method such as an absorbance measurement method
and a transmittance measurement method, a light-incident
surface and a light-outgoing surface are liable to be
stained, and therefore it has been difficult to maintain
high detection precision for a long period of time. In
the type of apparatus in which an oil layer is interposed
between an light-incident surface and a light-outgoing
surface, the thickness of the oil layer greatly
influences the detection precision, but it has been
difficult to set the thickness of the oil layer to an
optimum value because of the fact that foreign matters
included in oil must be prevented from being jammed and
of a limited assembling precision in the manufacture.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for detecting particles in a liquid,
comprising:


a prism member (15, 16, 17, 18) having a boundary
surface (80, 361, 362, 363, 364) in contact with the liquid

to be examined;
a light-emitting portion (11) for emitting light through said prism member
toward said boundary surface;
a photosensor (12) for receiving the light reflected
by said boundary surface with Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift and for

outputting a signal corresponding to the amount of said
received light; and
a reference photosensor (13) for directly receiving
the light emitted from said light-emitting portion.
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising

means (24) for judging that the concentration of the
particles in the liquid to be examined exceeds a

predetermined concentration when the output signal from
said photosensor exceeds a predetermined value; and
means (22) for compensating a change of the output
signal of said photosensor, caused by a change of the

amount of the light emitted from said light-emitting
portion, in accordance with an output signal from said

reference sensor.
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising 

a housing (40) receiving said light-emitting portion,
said photosensor and said prism member therein, said

housing having a projected portion (41) which is to be
threaded to a container or a conduit holding the liquid,

and through which the liquid is introduced to said boundary
surface of said prism member.
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising

cleaning members (35) which are moved by the flow of
the liquid to be examined, and are capable to come into

contact with said boundary surface.
Apparatus according to claim 4, further comprising

flow-out prevention members (43, 415) which prevent
said cleaning members (35) from flowing away from the

vicinity of said boundary surface while allowing the liquid
to flow in the vicinity of said boundary surface.
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising

a filter (413, 513) through which the oil passes, and
a sensor (417, 517) for detecting a rate of flow of
the oil through said filter,
with said filter having such a mesh that it arrests
the carbon particles of a size larger than a predetermined

particle size.
Apparatus according to claim 6, further comprising

judgment means (418, 518) being responsive to a change
of the flow rate detected by said flow rate sensor and

outputting a signal representative of the oil performance.
