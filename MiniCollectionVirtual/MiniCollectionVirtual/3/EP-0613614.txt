device (30), a seedling picker device (150) for picking seedlings 

from the 
seedling supply device (30) at a predetermined picking position, and a 

seedling planting device (190) for receiving the seedling from the 
seedling 

picker device (150) at a predetermined delivery position and planting 
them in 

a field, the seedling supply device (30) including a frame (33) for 
supporting a 

seedling tray (31) formed with multiple cells (31a) in which seedlings 
are grown, a 

traverse feeding mechanism (34) for moving the frame (33) transversely so 
that a 

selected cell is located at the predetermined picking position, and a 
longitudinal feeding mechanism (35) for logitudinally feeding the 

seedling 
tray pitch (31) by pitch when the frame is moved to a right or left 

terminal 
position thereof, the seedling picker device (150) including a pair of 

seedling picker claws (167) for picking the seedling from the cell and 
delivering it to the seedling planting device (190), and a seedling 

picker 
driving mechanism (151) for moving the seedling picker claws from the 

predetermined picking position to the predetermined delivery position, 
the seedling picker driving mechanism (151) being arranged such that 

the 
seedling picker claws (167) are inserted into the cell at the 

predetermined 
picking position with a space between the leading ends thereof being 

slightly narrowed than the width of the upper end of the cell, and after 
the seedling picker claws (167) are inserted, the seedling can be gripped 

by 
narrowing the space between the leading ends of the seedling picker 

claws (167), and the space between the leading ends of the seedling 
picker 

claws (167) is widened at the predetermined delivery position. The thus 
constituted seedling planting apparatus can effect proper planting of 

seedlings with a mechanism of simple structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seedling planting apparatus
including a seedling supply device and a seedling picker device and, in
particular, to a seedling planting apparatus which can effect proper
planting of seedlings with a mechanism of simple structure.Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 2-90919 discloses a seedling
planting apparatus including a carriage, a seedling supply device and a
seedling planting device for planting seedlings supplied from the
seedling supply device in a field. The seedling supply device of the
prior apparatus has a longitudinal feeding mechanism for feeding a
seedling tray formed with a plurality of cells each adapted for
receiving a seedling to the seedling planting device longitudinally, by
which each seedling can be fed to the seedling planting device pitch by
pitch. Further, the seedling planting device of the prior apparatus has
seedling picker claws adapted to reciprocate transversely, by which the
individual seedlings can be picked from the cells and then delivered to
a seedling planting claw to plant them in the field.However, because the prior apparatus is arranged such that the
seedling picker claws reciprocate transversely to pick seedlings from
the cells and to deliver them to the seedling planting claw, a
complicated mechanism has to be used for actuating the seedling planting
claw. Further, there is a problem that the planting of the seedlings
cannot be effected properly, due to the difficulty of accurately
positioning the seedling planting claw.Further, there is known a prior seedling planting apparatus having 
a seedling tray formed with multiple cells each tapering off from the
upper opening to the bottom thereof, wherein the seedling grown in each
of the cells is picked by a pair of seedling picker claws and delivered
to a seedling planting claw to plant it in the field. In this prior
apparatus, because each cell is shaped to taper off from the upper
opening to the bottom thereof, during the picking of the seedling from
the cell, the seedling picker claws are inserted into the cell so that
the width of the leading ends of the claws is almost equal to that of
the bottom of the cell.However, in the prior apparatus, because the seedling is more
weakly rotated in the center portion of the cell than in the portion
adjacent to the cell wall, when the seedling is gripped by the picker
claws during the planting operation, the seedling falls apart and,
therefore, it is difficult to properly plant the seedling in the field. Furthermore, EP-A-0 320 995
