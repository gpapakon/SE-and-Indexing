<CLAIMS>
Process for the selective preparation of dicycloalkyldialkoxysilanes
of the general formula



in which R
1
 and R
2
 are cycloalkyl groups having from 3
to 10 carbon atoms, and R
3
 are alkyl groups having 1 - 5
carbon atoms, it being possible for the radicals R
3
 to
be identical or different, by simultaneously reacting

tetraalkoxysilanes of the general formula Si(OR
3
)
4

and/or monoorganotrialkoxysilanes of the general formula
R
1
Si(OR
3
)
3
, in which R
1
 is a cycloalkyl radical,
with compounds of the general formula R
2
-X, in which
X = Cl, Br or I, and magnesium.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that R
1
 and R
2
 are identical or different cycloalkyl
groups having from 5 to 7 carbon atoms.
