<ABSTRACT>
Animal grooming aids (10, 30, 40, 50) in the form of brushes (30), combs (10), mitts (40) or vacuum cleaning head attachments (50), have a layer or coating of latex rubber (16, 42) which has a high coefficient of friction with the soft, fine undercoat (22) on dogs (20), and the fur on cats, to remove the loose hair (22) or fur. The loose hair (22) or fur cannot slip between the coated bristles or teeth (15, 31, 32) as easily as between uncoated bristles or teeth.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to animal grooming aids.One major problem with keeping pets, such as dogs and cats,
is picking up the hair or fur (hereinafter called "hair") which
they tend to shed onto furniture, the floors, clothing and the
like. Even regular grooming with existing combs or brushes does
not solve the problem as the combs or brushes do not remove the
loose under-coat hair or fur as the fine fibres "slip" between
the comb or brush teeth. (The very fine fur, if not removed, can
result in fatal furballs in cats).US-A-4 343 265 discloses an animal grooming brush where the
bristles or teeth are made entirely of neoprene (a hard rubber).
The present invention however is based on the use of latex
rubber, for reasons which will become clear from a reading of
this specification.DE-A-35 07 698 discloses an animal grooming mitt of
leader with protuberances of PVC stuck on the palm
which can be considered a prior art for the mitt of
claim 3, and the device of US-A-4 279 095 constitutes a
background for the embodiment of claim 4. The use of latex rubber in different products is known in
various applications as follows:-
(a) BE 904752 - (Gillard) "discloses protective gloves with
interchangeable accessories" where different accessories, e.g.
(i) to wash dishes; (ii) scour a bathroom; (iii) to sand or
polish furniture or a car body where gloves made of latex, rubber
or other material "whose external surface exhibits a material for
engaging and/or attaching any accessory". The gloves are
designed to enable removable accessories to be fitted to the
gloves, but there is no disclosure of the gloves per se being
used to groom animals.(b) W087/04061 - (McLeish et al) discloses no more than a
method of manufacturing a glove or mitten of rubber or plastics
material, including "bonding a cleaning article or a secondary
attachment means to at least the front finger wear of said glove
or mitten". Again, there is no disclosure of the glove or mitten
as an animal grooming aid. (c) DE 3232313 - (Finke) discloses "a glove
or mitten for oral-hygienic use" where different teeth
and/or gum treatment devices (e.g. bristles, rubber
naps, dental floss) are releasably securable to a finger
position. "The operating space extends from the
fingertip (Fingerbeere) through the Phalanx distalis
(nail) and Phalanx media (middle part of the finger).
The width of the operating area covers the inner side of
the finger in this area and extends for approximately 5
mm along the interdigital sides (sides of the finger)".
A device for oral
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An animal grooming comb (10) or brush where the bristles or
teeth (14) have a coating (16) of latex rubber or like soft

rubber.
A comb or brush as claimed in Claim 1 wherein:

small spheres of plastic (17) are provided on the tips of
the bristles or teeth to provide low friction contact with the

animal's skin while protecting the coating at the tips against
undue wear.
An animal grooming mitt (40) having a palm portion (41)
formed of, or faced by latex or other soft rubber (42) and having

short fingers (43) projecting from said palm portion, said rubber
projections having a high coefficient of friction with animal

hair so as to facilitate the removal of an animal's hair during
grooming by passing the mitt over or through an animal's coat.
An animal grooming aid (50) attachable to, or formed
integrally with, a cleaning head (51) of a vacuum cleaner, the

aid comprising a panel of latex rubber or like soft rubber
covering the cleaning face of the head and having only a

substantially central suction passage (52) therethrough.
An aid according to Claim 4 wherein the aid has integral
clip means for releasable engagement with the cleaning head.
