<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
refilling method and an ink refilling kit, in
particular, an ink refilling method for refilling the
ink into the ink storing portion of an exchangeable
ink cartridge that is integrally connected to a
recording head when in use, and an ink refilling
kit that is used in such a method.As for a recording system employed in a
recording apparatus that uses a recording head to
record images on recording medium (hereinafter, simply
recording paper or paper) such as a sheet of ordinary
paper of OHP, there are the wire dot system, thermal
system, thermal transfer system, or ink jet system.
In the case of the ink jet system, the recording
medium and recording head do not make contact during a
printing operation, offering such advantages as high
speed and low noise; therefore, it is one of the
systems that has recently been attracting the most
attention.As for the type of the ink jet type
apparatus, there are the thermal energy type that uses
the film boiling phenomenon, the type that employs a
piezoelectric element, the type that employs optical 
energy, and so on. In any case, they all form images
by ejecting ink droplets onto the recording medium.The ink jet recording apparatus comprises a
recording head for ejecting the ink and an ink
container for storing the ink, and has so many
different system configurations.In one of such system configurations, the
recording head and ink container are connected to each
other with the use of a connecting member such as a
piece of tube, and only the ink container is
exchanged, allowing the recording head to be semi-permanently
used.As for other system configurations, there
are: those in which the recording head and ink
container are integrally formed, and when the ink
within the ink container is depleted, the ink
container and recording head are both disposed; and
those in which the recording head and ink container
are independent from each other and separably
connected to form a head unit, and when the ink within
the ink container is depleted, the ink container is
separated from the head and exchanged with a fresh
one.In any case, the ink container must be
exchanged with a fresh one when the stored ink is
depleted. In particular, in the case of the system
employing the integral structure, even the recording 
head must be disposed of together with the ink
container, which makes the system extremely
uneconomical.There are also other problems. For example,
when an ink refilling apparatus is disposed of, it
must be grouped according to
