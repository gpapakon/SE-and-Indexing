<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a patch for the controlled release of readily volatile active substances to the skin, the patch comprising a back layer and, bonded to it, a water-insoluble adhesive film consisting of a pressure-sensitive fusion adhesive, plus a detachable film covering the adhesive film. The patch is characterized in that the pressure-sensitive fusion adhesive contains a triple-block copolymer of polystyrene block copoly(ethylene/butylene) block polystyrene (SEBS) at a concentration of 10 to 80 % by wt., preferably 20 to 40 % by wt., and an active substance which, at the temperature at which the adhesive bonds, is a readily volatile liquid and which is present at a concentration of 2.5 to 25 % by wt.

Active ingredient patch, for the controlled release of active ingredients to the skin 

consisting of a backing layer, and, bonded to it, of a water-insoluble adhesive film 
consisting of an active-ingredient-containing contact hot-melt adhesive organized as 

a matrix layer, and of a removable layer covering the adhesive film, characterized by 
the fact that the matrix layer comprises a contact hot-melt adhesive, which is a 

chemically saturated three-block copolymer of polystyrene-block-copoly-(ethylene-butylene)-block-polystyrene 
(SEBS), in a concentration of 10 to 80 weight % and 

without the addition of water-swellable polymers, and the matrix layer further comprises 
an active ingredient, at a concentration of 2.5 to 25 weight %, which is liquid, 

low-melting and/or volatile at the processing temperature of the contact hot-melt adhesive. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that it preferably 
contains a three-block copolymer (SEBS) in a concentration of 20 to 40 weight %. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized by the fact that 
the styrene content of the SEBS three-block copolymer is 10 to 50 weight %. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 1-3, characterized by the fact that the 
styrene content of the SEBS three-block copolymer is preferably 10 to 30 weight %. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 1-4, characterized by the fact that the 
contact hot-melt adhesive is a three-block copolymer of polystyrene-block-copoly 

(ethylene-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS), at a concentration of 10 to 80 weight 
% and contains between 20 and 90 weight % tackifier and optionally 0.1 to 1 weight 

% antiaging agent. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claim 5, characterized by the fact that the 
contact hot-melt adhesive contains preferably 40 to 70 weight % tackifier and optionally 

0.1 to 1 weight % antiaging agent. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 5 and 6, characterized by the fact that 
the contact hot-melt adhesive contains aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbon resins 

as tackifier which are compatible with the end blocks and/or middle block of the 
SEBS three-block-polymer.  

 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 5-7, characterized by the fact that the 
contact hot-melt adhesive contains hydroabietyl alcohol as tackifier. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 1-8, characterized by the fact that it 
contains nicotine as active ingredient. 
Active ingredient patch according to Claims 1-9, characterized by the fact that it 
contains a β-receptor blocker as active ingredient. 
Method for the preparation of active ingredient patches according to Claims 1-10, 
characterized by the fact that the components of the contact hot-melt adhesive that 

form the matrix layer are mixed under heating to 100 to 200°C in an inert gas atmosphere 
until a homogeneous melt is obtained, before adding active ingredient, and 

then the active ingredient is dissolved in the contact adhesive melt under an inert gas 
at a processing temperature of 100 to 200°C and the homogeneous mixture is applied 

onto the covering layer, which is impermeable to the active ingredient. 
Method for the preparation of active ingredient patches according to Claims 1-11, 
characterized by the fact that the components of the contact hot-melt adhesive are 

mixed before the addition of the active ingredient by heating to preferably 110 to 
170°C in an inert gas atmosphere until a homogeneous melt is obtained and then the 

active ingredient is dissolved in the contact adhesive melt under an inter gas at a 
processing temperature of preferably 110 to 130°C. 
Method for the preparation of active ingredient patches according to Claims 1-12, 
characterized by the fact that the homogeneous active-ingredient-containing contact 

hot-melt adhesive composition is applied onto the removable protective layer or onto 
an antiadhesive substrate by extrusion, casting, roll application, blade application, 

spraying or by a pressure process and is covered with the backing layer. 
Method for the preparation of active ingredient patches according to Claims 1-13, 
characterized by the fact that the homogeneous active-ingredient-containing contact 

hot-melt adhesive composition is applied onto the backing layer by extrusion, casting, 
roll application, blade application, spraying or a pressure method and is covered with 

the removable protective layer. 
Method for the preparation of active ingredient patches according to Claims 1-14, 
characterized by the fact that the division of the active ingredient patch is done by 

cutting and/or format stamping.
