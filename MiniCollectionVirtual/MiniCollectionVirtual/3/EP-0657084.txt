<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for use in equipment
providing a digital radio link between a fixed and a mobile radio unit.In a cellular mobile radio system employing direct sequence code
division multiple access (CDMA) it is possible to re-use the same carrier
frequency in adjacent cells. However, traditionally this has only worked
well if it can be guaranteed that every mobile communicates through the
base station to which it has the best communication path at all times.
For mobiles well within the boundary of a particular cell this does not
cause problems because the optimum base station will almost always be
the base station serving the cell in which that mobile is placed.
However, consider the example shown in Figure 1, where the mobile 2
is meandering along the cell boundary so that its path and therefore its
optimum affiliation is varying between the two base stations as shown in
Figure 2. With reference to Figure 2, it can be seen that as the mobile 2
meanders between points A and B the receiving strength 
is shown accordingly with reference to the base station 4 and the
base station 6. The boxed section as shown in Figure 2 shows the
preferred base station that should be used. The clear boxes
represent base station 4 and the hatch boxes represent base
station 6.In a real situation the variation in signal strength is more
likely to be due to variations in the shadowing (eg. due to
buildings) over the paths from the two base stations. This will
cause no difficulties if the mobile is moving slowly from the region
in which one base station is optimum to the region in which the
other base station is preferred. Essentially, as the optimum
affiliation changes, the network can be arranged to force a
handover so that the mobile will continue to communicate through
the better base station.However, if the mobile is moving very rapidly and/or if the
variations in shadowing are spatially very frequent, these
handovers could be required more often than the network can
service. In this case the mobile could spend a significant
proportion of the time affiliated to the wrong base station. For all
of the time that this is the case, assuming downlink power control
is operational the base station has to transmit more power to the
mobile than would need to be transmitted from the other base
station. Since the CDMA cellular mobile network is interference
limited, these periods of incorrect affiliation will result
temporarily in degraded overall system capacity. Traditionally, the solution to the above
