<ABSTRACT>
A method of joining a solid electrolyte tube (1) 

and an insulating ring (2) in the manufacture of a 
sodium-sulfur cell uses an alumina borosilicate series 

glass. A small space is defined surrounding a joining 
zone of the solid electrolyte tube (1) and the insulating 

ring (2) with the aid of an atmosphere-protecting jig 
(15), and the solid electrolyte tube and the insulating 

ring are joined in the small space, while evaporation of 
components of the alumina borosilicate series glass from 

the surface of the glass is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sodium-sulfur
cell, particularly a sodium sulfur cell having a solid
electrolyte tube joined to an insulative ring which
electrically insulates a positive electrode chamber from
a negative electrode chamber, and a method of joining
the solid electrolyte tube and the insulative ring.A sodium-sulfur cell is a sealed type high
temperature secondary cell which is operated at a high
temperature of 300-350°C having a sodium ion-conductive
solid electrolyte tube made of β-alumina, β''-alumina or
the like for separating sodium which is an active
substance of the negative electrode from sulfur which is
an active substance of the positive electrode.A structure of a conventional sodium-sulfur cell
is shown in the attached Fig. 4a, having a solid electrolyte
tube 1, a negative electrode chamber 6 filled with
sodium arranged at the inside of the solid electrolyte
tube 1, a positive electrode chamber 5 filled with sulfur
arranged at the outside of the solid electrolyte tube 1,
and an insulative ring 2 made of α-alumina joined to the
upper end of the outer circumferential surface of the
solid electrolyte tube 1 by means of a solder glass 9.
Reference numerals 3 and 4 are metallic lids made of 
aluminum or coated with aluminum joined under pressure
and heating to the bottom surface and the top surface of
the insulative ring 2 for covering the positive
electrode chamber and the negative electrode chamber,
respectively. Reference numeral numeral 7 is a cell
vessel, and 8 is a negative electrode terminal tube.A joining portion of the solid electrolyte tube
1 and the insulative ring 2 of Fig. 4a is shown in
enlarged view in the attached Fig. 4b, wherein reference
numeral 9 is a solder glass made of an alumina-borosilicate
series glass, etc.Though the sodium-sulfur cell of conventional
structure of Figs. 4a and 4b has the positive electrode
chamber 5 and the negative electrode chamber 6 at the
outside and the inside, respectively, of the solid
electrolyte tube 1, the sodium-sulfur cell may also be
formed by arranging the negative electrode chamber 5 and
the positive electrode 6 vice versa, namely at the
inside and the outside, respectively, of the solid
electrolyte tube 1.Because the sodium-sulfur cell is a type of cell
which is operated at a high temperature of 300-350°C, it
undergoes a large thermal change due to start and stop
of its operation, and the amount of sodium ions which is
the active substance is increased or decreased by
transfer thereof through the solid electrolyte tube 1

A method of joining a solid electrolyte tube (1) and
an insulating ring (2) by means of an alumina

borosilicate series glass (9), wherein the glass (9) is
brought into a gap of 100 - 500µm width between the tube

(1) and the ring (2) and wherein, as seen in axial cross-section,
a taper surface (11a,11b) is present in at least

one of the tube (1) and the ring (2) so as to provide a
widening region of the glass (9), the method comprising

defining a small space surrounding a joining zone of the
solid electrolyte tube (1) and the insulating ring (2)

with the aid of an atmosphere-protecting jig (15), and
joining the solid electrolyte tube and the insulating

ring in the small space, while preventing evaporation of
components of the alumina borosilicate series glass from

the surface of the glass.
A method according to claim 1, wherein after joining
the concentration of boron B at a depth of 10µm from the

surface of the alumina borosilicate series glass in the
joining zone is at least 90% of the concentration of

boron B at a depth of 1000µm from the surface of the
glass in the joining zone.
A sodium-sulfur cell, comprising a solid electrolyte
tube (1), an insulating ring (2) around the tube (1) with 

a gap of 100 - 500µm width between the tube (1) and the
ring (2), and a body of solder glass (9) in the gap for

joining the ring to the tube, a first end of said glass
being exposed to an anode chamber of the cell, wherein as

seen in axial cross-section a taper surface (11a,11b) is
present on at least one of the tube (1) and the ring (2)

for providing a widening region of said glass (9) at said
first end of the glass, characterized in that the solder

glass is an alumina borosilicate series glass and the
concentration of boron B at a depth of 10µm from the

surface of the alumina borosilicate series glass in the
joining portion is at least 90% of the concentration of

boron B at a depth of 1000µm from the surface of the
alumina in the joining portion.
A sodium-sulfur cell according to claim 3, wherein
said body of glass (9) has, in addition to said widening

region, a region having cylindrical inner and outer
surfaces, more remote from said cathode chamber than said

widening region.
