<ABSTRACT>
In a linear transmitter (20) for use in 
combination with a radio communication system of TDMA 

that has a plurality of radio stations each of which has 
the linear transmitter, the linear transmitter is 

supplied with an input signal having a preamble at a 
first period and an information signal at a second period 

following the first period. The linear transmitter 
comprises a switching circuit (21) for supplying a 

quadrature modulator circuit (14) with the input signal 
during the first period. The switching circuit supplies 

the quadrature modulator circuit with a difference signal 
of a differential amplifier (13) which is supplied with 

the input signal. A quadrature demodulator (18) 
quadrature demodulates a transmission signal into a 

feedback signal having feedback inphase and feedback 
quadrature components in accordance with a phase adjusted 

carrier signal which is supplied from a phase adjusting 
circuit (23). A monitoring circuit (22) monitors a level 

of the feedback quadrature component during the first 
period to produce a level monitored signal representative 

of a monitored level. The phase adjusting circuit 
adjusts a carrier phase of a carrier signal in accordance 

with the level monitored signal during the first period 
to produce a phase adjusted carrier signal. The phase 

adjusting circuit supplies the phase adjusted carrier 
signal to the quadrature demodulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a linear transmitter
for use in combination with a radio communication system
of time division multiple access (TDMA).
Such a transmitter having both an open loop and a
closed loop training mode copability is known fram US-A-5 066 923In general, a radio communication system using
time division multiple access (TDMA) comprises a relay
station and a plurality of radio stations which
communicate with one another through the relay station.
In the radio communication system of TDMA, one of time
slots is assigned as a specific time slot to a specific
one of the radio stations. When the specific radio
station transmits a transmission signal to the relay
station in the specific time slot, the specific radio
station transmits the transmission signal as a burst
signal to the relay station as known in the art.Each of the radio stations may be used as one of
a fixed station and a mobile station. The mobile station
may be carried by an automobile, a human being, or the
like and has a variable location. Each of the radio
stations comprises a linear transmitter for transmitting
the transmission signal to the relay station in order to
improve a non-linear distortion of the transmission 
signal. The linear transmitter produces the transmission
signal having transmission inphase and transmission
quadrature components in accordance with an input signal
having input inphase and input quadrature components
during a predetermined period. The predetermined period
may be called a burst period.In general, the linear transmitter implements a
linear power amplifier to amplify a modulated signal
which has a time varying amplitude (magnitude) for
transmission. It is desirable for the linear power
amplifier to provide good linearity and efficient power
conversion. It is necessary to further reduce an
amplifier distortion in the linear power amplifier. In
order to reduce the amplifier distortion, the linear
transmitter uses a negative feedback loop on which a
feedback signal passes. The feedback signal has feedback
inphase and feedback quadrature components. A cartesian
loop is a known method for implementing the negative
feedback loop around the linear power amplifier. A net
phase shift around the cartesian loop must be maintained
about 180 degrees at a desired channel frequency in order
to insure stable operation.However, the cartesian loop becomes unstable when
a phase shift occurs between the input signal and the
feedback signal. When the phase shift occurs between the
input signal and the feedback
