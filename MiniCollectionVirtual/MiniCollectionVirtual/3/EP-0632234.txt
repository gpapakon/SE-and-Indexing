<ABSTRACT>
In a variable air volume system, chilled air is 
supplied from a cooler (10) to a number of zones (14, 

16, 18). Zone controllers (30, 32, 34) send the supply 
air temperature detected by sensors (48, 50, 52) to a 

master controller (12) which issues a warning to all of 
the sensors when at least one of these temperatures 

drops too low, e.g. passed a trip temperature of one of 
the stages of the cooler (10). On receiving the 

warning, each zone controller (30, 32, 34) compensates 
by adjusting the air flow to its zone (14, 16, 18) using 

dampers (42, 44, 46). Different adjustments occur 
depending on whether the zone temperature is above or 

below a zone setpoint. The invention is also applicable 
to a heating system and to the monitoring of too great a 

rise in the temperature of supplied heated air.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of dampers in a
variable air volume system wherein each damper defines
the volume of chilled or heated air being made available
to a zone to be cooled or heated respectively. In
particular, this invention relates to the control of
these dampers when the chilled air being supplied to the
dampers drops below a permissible level,or the heated
air rises above a permissible level.Variable air volume (VAV) systems are widely used to
supply chilled or heated air from a central source to
different zones of a home or office building. An
example of a VAV system is disclosed in e.g. CH-A-672851.
The typical VAV system furnishes a variable
volume of air to a particular zone depending on that
zone's needs as measured by a thermostat sensing the
temperature of the space or zone. The volume of air to
be provided is controlled by at least one damper in a
duct supplying the air to the zone. The damper is
positioned within the duct in response to the measured
needs of the zone. In this regard, when the temperature
of the space deviates from a predetermined setpoint, the
damper is moved to a more open position so as to allow a
greater volume of chilled or heated air to flow into the
zoned space. Conversely, as the temperature of the
space approaches the setpoint, the damper is moved to a
more closed position so as to decrease the volume of
chilled or heated air flowing into the space.There may be times when most of the dampers in a
multiple zoned system have moved to a closed position as
setpoints in their respective zones have been achieved.
The remaining zones may suddenly be receiving large
amounts of chilled or heated air previously going to the
closed damper zones. This problem is normally solved by 
bleeding off some of the chilled or heated air going to
the zones in a bypass configuration. This in turn leads
either to the recycling of colder than normal air
through the chiller unit and possible a frosting of the
coils, or the recycling of hotter than normal air
through the heat exchanger and possible overheating of
the unit. There is a need under such circumstances to
provide as much relief as possible to such frosting or
overheating.There may be other conditions occurring in the VAV
system that would lead to the aforementioned frosting or
overheating. In each case, there is a need to provide
as much relief as possible.The invention provides a system and process as recited
in claims 1 and 13 respectively. It provides for a
reactive control for a VAV system which begins with
moni
