<ABSTRACT>
A guard (12) for mounting on a power tool (1), which 
guard is of one piece construction, and comprises a central 

transparent region (14) surrounded by an outer 
non-transparent region (16) and is adapted for mounting on 

the power tool (1). The guard is particularly suitable for 
mounting on a hedge trimmer or chain saw.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a guard for a power
tool, in particular a guard for a hedge clipper or a chain
saw.It is know to provide guards for power tools of this
type, in order to protect the operator of the tool from
flying debris generated during the operation of the tool.
The first guards provided were manufactured from
non-transparent material and, while they provide acceptable
protection for the operator, they have the disadvantage that
a substantial part of the working area is obscured from the
operator.In an alternative known design, the guard is made from
transparent material. While this overcomes the disadvantage
of obscuring part of the working area, it does have the
disadvantage that the operator can see not only the working
area but the surrounding parts of the tool body.In a further alternative design, the guard has been
manufactured from non-transparent material, but the central
region has been made of mesh. This has the disadvantages
that it is expensive to manufacture, because of high tooling
costs, and the protection for the operator is reduced by the
fact that fine debris, such as small twigs and other similar
material, can pass through the holes in the mesh.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
guard for a power tool in which the above disadvantages are
reduced or substantially obviated.The present invention provides a guard for mounting on
a power tool, which guard is of one piece construction and
comprises a central transparent region surrounded by an
outer non-transparent region, and is adapted for mounting on
the power tool. The guard according to the invention is of
one-piece construction, which is advantageous for cost and
strength; avoids the possibility of the transparent portion
falling out, and provides maximum clarity.The guard according to the invention is preferably
manufactured from synthetic plastics material, and suitable
materials include polycarbonate, styrene-acrylo-nitrile
(SAN), polypropylene; acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)
and styrene.The guard according to the invention is preferably
manufactured by a moulding process, in particular injection
moulding. The non-transparent portion is made
non-transparent by texturing the surface on both sides in
the mould, suitably by spark erosion or chemical deposition.
It is a requirement of the moulding process that the areas
of the mould which correspond to the central transparent
region have highly polished surfaces.An embodiment of a guard according to the invention
will now be described with
