<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pivot joint with a housing (4) in which a ball-headed pivot (1) is supported by its bearing surface (1a), which has the shape of an annular segment of a ball, by means of an inserted bearing shell (3) such that it can swivel and pivot without play within a limited range and counter to a restoring force, the housing (4) being closed by a cover (5). In order to provide a pivot joint, the defined restoring force of the spring (5) of which is independent of the respective tolerances and in which the restoring force increases in accordance with the spring characteristic and shape as the deflection increases, the ball headed pivot (1) is provided with an end face (1b) lying opposite the pivot shank (2) and with a recess (7) formed in this end face (1b) and running out conically, on the cone surface (7a) of which there rests a ball (6) which is loaded by the force of a spring (5) that is supported against the cover (8).

<CLAIMS>
Pivot joint having a housing (4), which is closed by 
means of a cover (8) and in which a ball pivot (1) via 

a spherical ring-shaped bearing surface (la) is 
supported by means of an inserted bearing shell (3) so 

as to be rotatable without play and capable of 
swivelling within a limited range counter to a 

restoring force, the ball pivot (1) being provided with 
a conical countersunk portion (7) lying opposite the 

pivot shank (2) for receiving a ball (6) which, for 
producing the restoring force, is loaded by a spring 

(5) supported against the cover (8),
 
characterized in
 
that the spring (5) takes the form of a cup spring, 

which lies with its convex side against the ball (6) 
and is supported by its edge against the cover (8). 
Pivot joint according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the spring (5) in the form of a cup spring is supported 

by its edge in a recess (8a) in the cover (8). 
Pivot joint according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the bearing shell (3) is manufactured as a single 

piece made of polyamide.
