<ABSTRACT>
A generally flat, flexible, resilient, double faced spring (12) used in 
combination with a generally flat spacer (13) with the spring having the same 

number of uniform protrusions (16) on each of its flat surfaces, the 
protrusions on each surface being equidistant from each other. The 

protrusions have spherical tips (20) which function as multiple fulcrums, a 
spherical tip protrusion on one side of the spring surface being precisely 

half way between the spherical protrusion on the other surface such that no 
protrusion on one surface is exactly opposite a protrusion on the other. The 

essentially flat spacer is equipped with protrusion receiving recesses spaced 
to coincide with the locations of the protrusions on the adjacent spring. 

The tip of each protrusion of a spring is in alignment with the respective 
spacer recess so that when multi-protrusion springs are combined with a 

spacer, they are prevented by the recesses from laterally shifting or moving 
into a rotational position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a Continuation-in-Part of an earlier patent 
application entitled "UNIFORM LOADING SPRINGS OF IMPROVED 
CONFIGURATION" and all of the significant teachings of that application 
are incorporated into this application. This invention relates to uniform loading springs traditionally 
included in a category of springs described generally as leaf springs, 
diaphragm springs, suspension springs or the like that form a cushioning 
or load bearing function. The springs of this invention may be employed in 
a wide variety of systems and can replace existing washers and springs 
such as wavy spring washers, curved spring washers, compression springs, 
and precision washers as well as lockwashers and the springs noted above. 
The springs comprising the present invention are controlled by simple 
beam deflection. Prior art devices bearing some similarity to the present invention are 
reflected in, for example, U. S. Patent No. 2,179,575 to Hosking, entitled 
"Lock Washer." This patent describes a device having a plurality of 
projections or locking elements which project from opposite sides of the 
washer body. In such a structure, these projections may include corners or  
 
edges that define sharp work-engaging corners or edges that can embed 
themselves within the surface of the work piece; i.e. a screw head or nut. 
Thus, Hosking encourages the lock washer to engage the adjacent 
member--the underside of a screw head or a nut--in a scraping or scarring 
manner, so as "to effectively secure the nut against retrograde movement." Consequently, an object of this invention is to provide springs which 
have great versatility; uniform spring loading, compression, and flexibility 
under variable environmental conditions; and no damage to adjacent 
members. The springs of the present invention are designed to minimize 
friction, overheating, shear, stress, fatigue, deformation, noise levels, 
oscillations, and vibrations. Another object is to reduce weight and bulk 
and enhance load capacity as compared to existing springs employed for 
comparable jobs. Existing lockwashers are typically loaded at one or sometimes 
several points. This causes shearing, scarring or other damage to the 
screw or base of the metal. However, if washers are used on both sides of 
the ordinary lockwasher, there is a tendency to loosen under vibration. 
Thus, another object of this invention is to prevent spring loosening, while 
avoiding metal fracture, scarring and chipping. Many spring systems and designs have failed

<CLAIMS>
A uniform loading spring able to be utilized in 
compression between two adjacent members, the spring being 

substantially flat, of a flexible material and having a double 
surface, each surface having at least two symmetrically shaped 

protrusions mounted thereon, each of the protrusions having a 
base portion, the spring being in combination with a spacer of 

approximately the same size and same general configuration as the 
spring, and having a number of tip-receiving recesses therein, 

with the spacing of the recesses being identical to the spacing 
of the tip portions of the protrusions, such that when the spring 

and the spacer have been brought into an operative relationship, 
the spherical tips of the protrusions are received in the 

recesses to prevent an undesired rotation of the spacer with 
respect to the spring during the utilization of the spring. 
The uniform spring as claimed in claim 1 wherein a 
single spacer is utilized with the spring. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
additional predetermined combinations of spring and spacers are 

operably joined to utilize in compression loads of selected 
sizes. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
two springs are utilized, between which a spacer is used, with 

the recesses utilized on the surfaces of the spacer being in 
operative relation with the adjacent protrusions associated with 

each of the springs. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
two springs are utilized, between which springs a spacer is 

utilized, with the recesses utilized on the surfaces of the 
spacer being in operative relation with the adjacent protrusions 

associated with each of the springs, each of the springs having a 
separate spacer utilized in operative relation with its 

protrusions that are directed away from the spacer utilized 
between the springs. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the protrusions carried by one surface of the spring are 

precisely intermediate the protrusions carried by the other 
surface of the spring. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 6 wherein 
a single spacer is utilized with the spring. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 6 wherein 
a spacer is utilized in relation with each set of protrusions 

extending away from each surface of the spring. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 6 wherein 
two springs are utilized between which a spacer is used with the 

recesses utilized on the surfaces of the spacer being in 
operative relation with the adjacent protrusions associated with 

each of the springs. 
The uniform loading spring as claimed in claim 6 
wherein two springs are utilized between which springs the spacer 

is utilized with the recesses utilized on the surfaces of the 

spacer being in operative relation with the adjacent protrusions 
 

associated with each of the springs, each of the springs having a 
separate spacer utilized in operative relation with its 

protrusions that are directed away from the spacer utilized 
between the springs.
