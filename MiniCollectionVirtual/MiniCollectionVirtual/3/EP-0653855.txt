<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a differential switched capacitor circuit. Switching systems which comprise a differential switched capacitor 
circuit, having outputs coupled to the inputs of an operational amplifier, are 
well known. The operational amplifier of such systems usually has some level of 
noise. This may be caused by thermal or flicker noise of the operational 
amplifier's internal components or shot noise in its input currents. This 
noise of the operational amplifier significantly reduces the dynamic range of 
the system and thus careful operational amplifier design is required. In mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), that is ICs which process 
both analog and digital signals, digital spikes may migrate to the analog part 
of the IC, with the result that the noise level of the operational amplifier 
increases. In practice, it is virtually impossible to avoid digital spike 
penetration to the analog part and thus, noise in such mixed-signal ICs is 
particularly problematical. In oversampling systems, only the low frequency noise components, 
which fall into the system's bandwidth, are problematical. However, 
switched capacitor circuits sample the high frequency noises on the 
capacitors and alias them to low frequencies. Thus, such sampled noises also 
add to the noise problem. It would therefore be desirable to design a switched capacitor circuit 
which reduces the aliasing of high frequency noise and spikes to low 
frequencies and which also reduces low frequency noise. A number of solution, which attempt to address the noise problems, 
have been developed. One solution is described in a paper by Mike 
Rebeschini et al, entitled 'A 16-bit 160 kHz A/D Converter Using Sigma-Delta 
Modulation' (IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. 25, #2, April 
1990). This solution is commonly called the 'Auto-Zero Circuit' or 'Noise 
Correlation Circuit'. The auto-zero circuit compensates for the error signal on the inputs of 
the operational amplifier. The error signal may be due to offset and/or low 
frequency noise. The compensation is based on measuring the operational 
amplifier input error voltage in one phase and using it for input error  
 
compensation during the other phase. It is assumed that the input error 
signal does not significantly change between phases. In mixed-signal systems, digital spikes and high frequency noise 
change rapidly between the measurement phase and the compensation 
phase. Hence, in such systems, the noise cannot be properly compensated 
and this approach cannot
