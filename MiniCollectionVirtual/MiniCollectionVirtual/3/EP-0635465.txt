<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a panel system for forming panel floors for the storage of loose materials, in particular for composting, aerating and/or draining organic matter and/or for treating gases by means of a filter-material bed located on the panel base, there being provided in each case a plurality of bottom panels (17) which are to be laid on an underlying surface, a plurality of top load-bearing panels (16) provided with through-passage openings (6), and a plurality of regularly spaced-apart spacers (10, 11, 13) between the bottom panels (17) and the load-bearing panels (16) in order to provide a cavity (18) between the same. The panel system according to the invention is characterised   - in that the bottom panels (17), the load-bearing panels (16) and the spacers (10, 11, 13) are plastic injected-moulded parts, - in that the spacers (10, 11, 13) can be connected to the bottom panels (17) and/or to the load-bearing panels (16) and/or to one another by means of interengaging plug-in connections (1, 2, 3) and - in that the load-bearing panels (16) and bottom panels (17) forming the panel base are arranged such that they overlap one another in at least one surface direction.

Panel system for forming panel floors for the 
storage of pourable material, in particular for 

compost preparation, ventilation, and/or draining 
organic matters, and /or for the treatment of gases 

by means of a filter material bottom positioned at 
the panel floor, wherein 


a) in each case several bottom panels (17) to be 
positioned at a floor, several upper support 

panels (16) comprising apertures (6), and several 
spacers (10, 11, 13) arranged in a regular grid 

are provided between the bottom panels (17), and 
the support panels (16) to create a hollow space 

(18) in between, 
b) the bottom panels (17), the support panels (16), 
and the spacers (10, 11, 13) are injection moulding 

parts made of plastic material, 
c) the bottom panels (17), and/or the support panels 
(16) are formed with at least one expansion gap 

stop (19) at at least two adjacent edges with the 
expansion gap stop having elastic spring deflection 

properties and protruding from the edge line 
when unstressed, 
d) the spacers (10, 11, 13) are connectible with the 
bottom panels (17), and/or the support panels 

(16), and/or with each other by means of inter-engaging 
plug-in connections (1, 2, 3), and 
e) the bottom panels (17) forming the panel bottom, 
and the support panels (16) are arranged in an  

 
overlapping fashion in at least one direction of 

the surface. 
Panel system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the spacers (10, 11, 13) are formed integral 

with the bottom panel (17), and/or the support panel 
(16). 
Panel system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the spacers (10, 11, 13) are formed as 

hollow colums with a round or square cross-section 
with inwards
 arranged stiffening ribs or stiffening 
webs (12). 
Panel system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that the bottom panels 

(17), and the support panels (16) are square or 
rectangular, and that in the surface of the panels 

(16, 17) spacers (10) with a full cross-section are 
arranged, at the edges of the panels (16, 17) spacers 

(11) with a half cross-section are arranged, 
and that at the corners of the panels (16, 17) spacers 

(13) with a quarter cross-section are arranged 
wherein two spacers (11) each with a half cross-section 

of two adjacent panels (17, 16), and four 
spacers (13) each with a quarter cross-section of 

four adjacent panels (17, 16) complete each other 
to a full spacer cross-section. 
Panel system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that the plug-in connections 

(1, 2, 3) at the side of the panel are formed 
as plug-in profiles each having a plug-in profile 

edge (8) annularly engaging the free end of the spacer 
(10, 11, 13), and several plug-in profile clamps 

(9) arranged in the plug-in profile edge (8) in 
spaced relation therefrom and from each other wherein  

 
the distance is dimensioned such that the plug-in 

profile edge (8), and the plug-in profile clamp (9) 
hold the free end of a plugged in spacer (10, 11, 

13) in a clamp fitting. 
Panel system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that the support panels 

(16) are formed with a ribbing (4, 5) at the underside
