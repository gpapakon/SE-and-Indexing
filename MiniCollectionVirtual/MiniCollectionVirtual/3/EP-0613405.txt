<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a polyfluorocarbon coating on a razor blade cutting edge comprises subjecting a fluorocarbon polymer having a molecular weight of at least 1,000,000 in dry powder form to ionizing irradiation to reduce the molecular weight of the polymer forming a dispersion of the irradiated polymer in a volatile organic liquid, spraying the dispersion on to a razor blade cutting edge, and heating the coating obtained to sinter the polyfluorocarbon. The polyfluorocarbon preferably is polytetrafluoroethylene and irradiation preferably is effected to obtain a telomer having a molecular weight of about 25,000.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method
of coating cutting edges, more particularly razor
blade cutting edges, with fluorocarbon polymers.For many years razor blade cutting edges
have been coated with polyfluorocarbons, more
particularly polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); see,
for example, British Specification 906005. The
polyfluorocarbons used for this purpose are
telomers, that is they are polymers having a
relatively low molecular weight. Thus the PTFE
conventionally used for the coating of razor blade
cutting edges has a molecular weight of about
25000, as compared with PTFE which is
conventionally used for the formation of non-stick
coatings which has a molecular weight of 3-6
million.The reason for using fluorocarbon
telomers rather than high molecular weight
materials for coating cutting edges is that the
former give improved blade-to-blade uniformity and
coatings of improved durability.Polyfluorocarbons, such as PTFE, are
conventionally made by polymerization of the
monomer in an aqueous dispersion and this gives
rise to the high molecular weight material referred
to above. Fluorocarbon telomers are made by
polymerization in a chlorofluorocarbon, such as
trichlorotrifluoroethane. However, in view of
mounting pressure on industry for environmental
reasons to eliminate the use of CFCs in
manufacturing processes and in products, there is a
need to use an alternative process for making
fluorocarbon telomers.We have now found that fluorocarbon
telomers, more particularly, tetrafluoroethylene
telomers, made by subjecting high molecular weight
polyfluorocarbons in dry powder form to ionizing
irradiation can be used to form excellent
polyfluorocarbon coatings on razor blade cutting
edges, that is coatings having properties
equivalent to those obtained with fluorocarbon
telomers made by polymerization in a
chlorofluorocarbon. For the purpose of forming
such coatings the telomer formed by irradiation is
dispersed in a volatile organic solvent, such as
isopropanol, the dispersion is sprayed on to the
cutting edges and heated to remove the solvent and
sinter the telomer, the steps of spraying and
heating being carried out under generally
conventional conditions.U.S. Patent 4 777 192 describes a method for radiation degradation
of a polytetrafluoroethylene polymer to lower its molecular
weight to and
render it
grindable into
a powderAccording to the present invention, there
is provided a method of forming a polyfluorocarbon
