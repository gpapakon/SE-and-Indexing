<ABSTRACT>
It comprises a bed plane (1) heated by two units (8) which are suspended above it and which are spaced along a bent arm (7). In addition, a thermometer (17) is connected to the feedback control system (12) for the heating elements of the units (8) in order to adjust the heating intensity as a function of the ambient air temperature. The invention applies in particular to operating tables and incubators for babies.
