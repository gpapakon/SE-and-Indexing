<ABSTRACT>
In order to open a valve member (17) during the breakage of 
a temperature control element (41), there is provided a 

thermally-actuated steam trap comprising: a valve casing 
(1,2) having an inlet (6), a valve chest (4) and an outlet 

(7), a valve seat member (9) having a discharge passage 
between the valve chest (4) and the outlet (7), a 

temperature control element (41) disposed in the valve chest 
(4) and including a cover member (14), a diaphragm (42), 

and a valve member (17) and containing expansible medium, 
and a through hole (47) in the valve member (17) through 

which a face of the diaphragm (42) being not in contact 
with the expansible medium communicates with the discharge 

passage. An introducing passage, through which a space 
formed between the valve seat member and the diaphragm (42) 

communicates with the valve chest (4), and the discharge 
passage is provided in the valve seat member (9), and the 

valve member (17) is disposed in said space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steam trap to
automatically discharge condensate generated in various
kinds of steam using equipments and steam pipe lines, and
more particulary to a thermally-actuated steam trap
adapted to discharge the condensate of below a desired
temperature out of a system by using a temperature control
element including medium which is heated and cooled by
steam and condensate, and expanded and contracted in
accordance with the temperature thereof.The basic construction of a thermally-actuated steam trap
has been well-known, as disclosed in, for example, Japanese
examined patent publication No. 60-46318. As understood
from this publication, the thermally-actuated steam trap
comprises a temperature control element obtained by filling
expansible medium in an inner space formed by securing the
outer peripheral edges of a disk-like wall member and a
diaphragm to each other, a valve chest communicating with
an inlet in which the temperature control element is
provided, a valve member connected to the diaphragm,
provided in the valve chest and driven by employing the
expansion and contraction of the expansible medium and a
valve seat member having a discharge passage through which
the valve chest communicates with an outlet, on and from
which the valve member is seated and separated.When the steam of high temperature enters the valve chest,
the expansible medium expands, so that the valve member is
seated on the valve seat member to thereby close the 
discharge passage. Accordingly, the discharge of the
steam is prevented. When the condensate of low temperature
enters, the expansible medium is contracted and the valve
member is separated from the valve seat member to thereby
open the discharge passage. Thus, the condensate is
discharged out of a system.Such a thermally actuated steam trap, as defined in the first part of claim 1, is known from DE-A-3 124 664.However, in the thermally-actuated steam trap of such a
type, in the case where the temperature control element is
broken and the expansible medium flows out, the valve
member is seated on the valve seat member due to the fluid
pressure of the inlet side to thereby close the discharge
passage. When the valve member closes the passage upon the
breakage of the temperature control element, such problems
may arise that the condensate cannot be discharged, and
therefore, the operating efficiency of a steam using
equipment is deteriorated, defective articles are produced
or water hammer phenomenon is caused, which results in
breaking
