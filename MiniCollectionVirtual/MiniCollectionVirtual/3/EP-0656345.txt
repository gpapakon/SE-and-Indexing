<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel chemical compounds and their use as
pharmaceuticals.Certain 4-substituted glutamate derivatives are disclosed in
Heterocycles, vol. 31, 191-195, 1990, with neuroexcitatory effects or
neurological activity.The compounds of the inventidn have the formula

in which
n and q are each 0 or 1 to 5, and p is 0 or 1,X is -CO2H or tetrazolyl,Y is -CH=CH-, andZ is
(i) phenyl, naphthyl or thienyl, said phenyl, naphthyl and thienyl
being optionally substituted,(ii) -CHR1R2 where R1 and R2 are each phenyl, naphthyl or thienyl,
said phenyl, naphthyl and thienyl being optionally substituted,(iii) =CR1R2 where R1 and R2 are each phenyl, naphthyl or thienyl, said
phenyl, naphthyl and thienyl being optionally substituted, or(iv)

where r is 0 or 1 to 3 and the phenyl rings are optionally
substituted; 
provided that when Z is phenyl and m is 1, p is 1;
and salts and esters thereof.The compounds of the invention have been found to be active in tests
indicative of their use in the treatment of diseases of the central
nervous system such as neurological diseases, for example,
neurodegenerative diseases, and as antipsychotic, anticonvulsant,
analgesic and anti-emetic agents.In the above Formula (I), an optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl
or thienyl group is optionally substituted with, for example, one or
more substituents selected from C1-4 alkyl, especially methyl, C1-4
alkoxy, especially methoxy and ethoxy, carboxy, hydroxy, cyano, halo,
especially bromo, chloro and fluoro, trifluoromethyl, nitro, amino,
C1-4 acylamino and C1-4 alkylthio. An optionally substituted phenyl
or naphthyl group can be substituted at neighbouring carbon atoms by
-(CH2)4-. When substituted, a phenyl or naphthyl group is preferably
substituted by one to three substituents, and a thienyl group by a
single substituent. A naphthyl group can be 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl,
and a thienyl group can be 2- or 3-thienyl, being preferably
2-thienyl.When Z is
 
one or both of the phenyl nuclei can be substituted with, for example,
one or more substituents as specified above for substituted phenyl.
When r is 0 the two benzene nuclei are linked by a single bond.
Preferably r is 1 or 2.Preferred compounds are those which include one or more of the
following features:
(i) p is 0,(iii) X is -CO2H,(iii) Z is optionally substituted naphthyl,(iv) Z is naphthyl substituted at neighbouring carbon atoms by
-(CH2)4-,(v) Z is -CHR1R2 where R1 and R2 are each optionally substituted
phenyl, naphthyl or thienyl,(vii) Z is -CHR1R2 where R1 and
