<ABSTRACT>
In this method, in which   - the despatches travel through successive scanning means for generating a video image of each despatch, a mechanical storage path and a printing station, - the video images are supplied to first means for reading the address information and for allocating a corresponding code, the despatches, for which the address information was read within a predetermined time, are provided with the corresponding code in the printing station and the video images of the despatches, for which the address information has not been automatically read within the predetermined time, are supplied to video coding stations for reading the address information and for allocating a corresponding code, and - despatches which are not provided with a corresponding code are provided with an ID tag and - code and ID tag are stored in order to provide the relevant despatches with the code at a later time,  the following steps are carried out:   - the video image of each despatch for which the address information is not automatically read within the predetermined time, is stored in a buffer from which the most recent video image of which is supplied to the video coding stations, despatches, to which a corresponding code is thereupon allocated before the despatch reaches the printing station, being provided with the code in the printing station, - the remaining despatches are provided with an ID tag in the printing station.

Method of sorting items of mail provided with address data, in 
which 


the items of mail successively run through scanning means for 
generation of a video image of each item of mail, a mechanical 

storage path as well as a printing station, 
the video images are fed to first means for the reading of the 
address information and for the association of a corresponding 

code, wherein the items of mail for which the address 
information was read within a predetermined time are provided 

with the corresponding code in the printing station, and the 
video images of the items of mail for which the address 

information was not automatically read within the predetermined 
time are fed to video coding places for the reading of the 

address information and for the association of a corresponding 
code, and 
items of mail which are not provided with a corresponding code 
are provided with an ID tag and 
code and ID tag are stored so that the items of mail concerned 
can be provided with the code at a later point in time, 
the video image of each item of mail for which the address 
information is not automatically read within the predetermined 

time is filed in a buffer store, 
 
characterised thereby that the following steps are carried out: 


the respectively youngest video image is fed from the buffer 
store to the video coding places, wherein items of mail, to 

which a corresponding code is as a result assigned before the 
item of mail reaches the printing station, are provided with the 

code in the printing station,  
 
the remaining items of mail are provided with an ID tag in the 
printing station. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
automatic reading means are provided as first means for the reading. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised thereby that in 
addition video coding places are provided as first means for the 

reading. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby 
that the video images of items of mail which were provided only with 

an ID tag are fed at a later point in time to the video coding places 
or to means for the automatic reading of the address information. 
Method according to claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that the 
items of mail provided with a code are distributed into sorting boxes 

in accordance with this code. 
Method according to claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that a 
local online/offline output coding, local online/offline output and 

input coding, local online/offline output coding with offline input 
coding, local online output coding with remote offline input coding 

or remote offline output and input coding or remote online/offline 
output and input coding is provided. 
Method according to claim 1 to 6, characterised thereby that 
video images, which are held in the buffer store, of items of mail to 

which no code as assigned before the item of mail has reached the 
printing station are fed in accordance with a first in/first out rule 

to a store from which they are fed to the video coding places. 
Device for the sorting of items of mail provided with address 
data, comprising means for scanning, and for generating a video image 

of each item of mail, means for the automatic reading of the address 
information and for the association of a corresponding code to each 

video image, video coding places for the reading of the address  
 

information and for the association of a corresponding code to each 
video image, means for the storage of the video images and codes, a 

mechanical storage path, a printing station for the marking of items 
of mail as well as a checking unit for the control of the aforesaid 

means and components, wherein a buffer store is provided in which 
the video image of each item of mail is filed of which the address 

information was not automatically read within a predetermined time, 
characterised thereby that the respectively youngest video image is 

fed from the buffer store to the video coding places, wherein items 
of mail, to which a corresponding code is as a result assigned before 

the item of mail reaches the printing station, are provided with the 
code in the printing station and the remaining items of mail are 

provided with an ID tag in the printing station.
