<ABSTRACT>
A liquid dispensing pump (10) capable of 
inverted spray has a container vent including a spiral 

vent groove (46) of a length restricting the free flow 
of liquid therethrough to avoid leakage, and being 

sized so that while dispensing in the inverted 
position the rate of liquid discharge from the 

container (29) is greater than the flow of air through 
the vent groove (46) which thereby creates a vacuum in 

the container (29) and effects a suck-back of air 
through the vent into the container (29) for venting.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a manually actuated pump 
sprayer adapted for dispersing liquid from a container in both 
upright and inverted modes. More particularly, the pump sprayer 
has a container vent for equalizing the pressures within and 
outside the container when the pump is in operation to thereby 
prevent hydraulic lock of the pump piston, the vent being in the 
form of a spiral vent groove. In the prior art pump sprayers of the type shown in the U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,051,983, 4,154,374 and 4,986,453 the closure cap is 
directly or indirectly coupled to the pump cylinder at its upper 
end or supporting the pump body within the interior of the 
container to which the pump body is mounted. A vent path is 
defined from inside the container via the top of the pump 
cylinder and between the closure cap and the piston stem to the 
ambient for venting the container curing the piston downstroke 
and upstroke movements for replacing the liquid dispensed from 
the container with air to prevent container collapse during 
pumping and hydraulic piston lock. A depending collar on the 
closure cap is seated against an upper end of the pump piston at 
the end of the piston upstroke movement for sealing the vent path 
closed from the atmosphere to thereby avoid leakage through the 
vent path during shipping and storage of the pump assembly. These sprayers are not readily adapted for operation in an 
inverted or steeply slanted position, even with the provision of 
an inverted adaptor of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.  
 
4,277,001 or 4,775,079, since the container vent which opens 
during the upstroke and downstroke of movements of the piston 
during pumping allows for leakage of liquid product therethrough 
in that the vent path is not designed to restrict the passage of 
liquid nor is the vent path designed to control the rate of 
venting relative to product displacement during spraying. U.S. Patent No. 4,277,001 discloses an upright/inverted 
sprayer having spaced vent ports located in the pump cylinder 
wall controlled by upper and lower skirts on the piston. 
However, leakage of product through the open container vent port 
or ports during pumping is not positively avoided since the 
valved vent port arrangement is incapable of controlling the rate 
of venting in relation to the product being dispensed during 
pumping. Besides, an additional vent skirt on the piston is 
required which adds to the cost and complexity of the pump 
assembly. U.S. Patent No. 4,775,079 discloses an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A liquid dispensing pump, comprising a pump body 
containing a pump cylinder and a pump piston having an annular 

depending piston skirt arranged for reciprocating sliding 
engagement with the wall of said cylinder during piston 

downstroke and upstroke movements, said piston and said cylinder 
together defining a pump chamber having a valve controlled inlet 

opening, said piston having an upstanding piston stem, a 
depressible discharge head mounted on said piston stem and having 

a discharge orifice, a discharge passage extending through said 
piston and said head extending from said chamber and terminating 

in said orifice an invertible adaptor extending from a lower end 
of said pump body to permit dispensing in an inverted position 

upon actuation of the piston, said adaptor supporting a depending 
dip tube to permit dispensing in an upright position upon 

actuation of the piston, a closure cap having an upstanding 
annular wall coupled to said cylinder for supporting the pump 

body within the interior of a container of liquid to be 
dispensed, said wall having an inner surface in contact with an 

outer surface of said cylinder, means defining a vent path 
extending between the interior of said closure cap and the 

ambient, and vent valve means acting between said closure cap and 
said pump piston for sealing said vent path closed at the end of 

said upstroke movement of said piston and for opening said vent 
path during the piston upstroke and downstroke movements, said 

vent path means comprising a spiral vent groove of at least one 
 

complete turn formed in one of said inner and outer surfaces for 
restricting the free flow of liquid therethrough in one direction 

to avoid leakage while dispensing in the inverted position, and 
said spiral vent groove being sized so that while dispensing in 

the inverted position the rate of liquid discharge from the 
container is greater than the flow of air through said vent 

groove in an opposite direction which thereby creates a vacuum in 
the container and effects a suck-back of air through said vent 

path means into the container for venting. 
The pump according to claim 1, wherein said closure cap 
further has a central domed portion connected to said annular 

wall, and a collar depending from said domed portion and defining 
a central opening through which said piston stem extends. 
The pump according to claim 2, wherein said vent valve 
means comprises an enlarged annular section formed on said pistor 

stem in sealing engagement with said collar for sealing said vent 
path closed at the end of said upstroke movement, said collar 

disengaging said enlarged section for opening said vent path 
during the piston upstroke and downstroke movements. 
The pump according to claim 2, wherein said closure cap 
is coupled to said cylinder by the provision of an enlarged outer 

diameter section on an upper end of said cylinder received in an 
annular groove provided in said annular wall of said closure cap. 
The pump according to claim 4, wherein said spiral vent 
groove is located in said inner surface of said annular wall of 

said closure cap, said vent path means further comprising an 
 

annular gap formed between said enlarged outer diameter section 
and said annular groove, said vent groove terminating in said 

gap. 
The pump according to claim 5, wherein said vent path 
means further comprises a vertical slot located in said enlarged 

diameter section extending between said annular gap and an upper 
edge of said cylinder, said upper edge being spaced from said 

domed portion.
