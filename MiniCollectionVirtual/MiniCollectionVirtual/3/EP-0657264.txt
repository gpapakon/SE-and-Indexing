<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of contact lenses, polymerisable contact-lens material is dispensed into one mould half (1) and subsequently the mould is closed by mean of the second mould half (2). The material located in the mould cavity (12) between the two mould halves is subsequently polymerised and thus a still unhydrated contact lens (CL) is formed. The moulding surface of one of the two mould halves (1,2) is pretreated before its use in a region (20) outside the optically effective zone of the contact lens (CL) in such a way that the contact lens (CL) adheres to the pretreated mould half when the mould is opened.

A process for the manufacture of contact lenses, in which process a polymerisable contact
lens material is dispensed into one mould half (1), the mould is subsequently closed by means

of the second mould half (2) and then the material located between the two mould halves in the
moulding cavity (12) is polymerised, thus forming an as yet unhydrated contact lens (CL), the

moulding surface of one of the two mould halves (1, 2) being pre-treated by means of corona
discharge, before use, in such a manner that, when the mould is opened, the contact lens (CL)

adheres to the pre-treated mould half (1, 2), 
wherein
 the moulding surface of one of the two
mould halves (1, 2) is pre-treated only outside the optically active zone of the contact lens (CL),

using a corona-treatment device comprising two electrodes (4, 5) which are arranged at a
distance from each other and between which the mould half (1, 2) in question is arranged

during the pre-treatment, at least the electrode (4) facing the moulding surface of the mould
half (1, 2) to be treated having an annular face (40) which extends substantially over the

region (20) that is to be treated of the mould half (1, 2).
A process according to claim 1, which comprises pre-treating the male mould half (2).
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the unhydrated contact lens (CL)
adhering to the mould half (2) is tempered in an additional process step while the mould is still

closed, the mould is subsequently opened and then the mould half (2) to which the as yet
unhydrated contact lens (CL) is adhering is passed to a hydration station (9) where the

unhydrated contact lens (CL) is detached from the mould half (2) and hydrated.
A process according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the as yet unhydrated contact lens (CL)
adhering to the male mould half (2) is dyed in the iris region after opening of the mould.
A process according to claim 4, wherein the tampon printing method is used to dye the
as yet unhydrated contact lens (CL).
An apparatus for the manufacture of contact lenses, having a mould which comprises
two mould halves (1, 2), the mould halves (1, 2) having a moulding surface each and enclosing 

in the closed state of the mould a moulding cavity (12) which defines the shape of the contact
lens (CL), having a dispensing device (6) for feeding a polymerisable contact lens material into

the one mould half (1), having a light source (7) for exposing the contact lens material,
enclosed in the moulding cavity (12) after closing of the mould, to light, whereby the material

enclosed in the moulding cavity (12) is polymerised and an as yet unhydrated contact lens (CL)
is produced, and having a corona treatment device for pre-treating the moulding surface of one

of the two mould halves (1, 2) before use thereof, the moulding surface of one of the two
mould halves (1, 2) being pre-treated in such a manner that, when the mould is opened, the

contact lens adheres to the pre-treated mould half, 
wherein
 the corona-treatment device
comprises two electrodes (4, 5) which are arranged at a distance from each other and between

which the mould half (1, 2) in question is arranged during the pre-treatment, at least the
electrode (4) facing the moulding surface of the mould half (1, 2) to be treated having an

annular face (40) which extends substantially over the region (20) that is to be treated of the
mould half (1, 2).
An apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the mould half to be treated is the male mould
half (2), and the annular face (40) of the electrode (4) facing the moulding surface is concave.
An apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7, which comprises a tempering oven for the still

closed mould with the unhydrated contact lens (CL) adhering to the one mould half (2), and a
hydration device (9) for detaching and hydrating the as yet unhydrated contact lens (CL).
An apparatus according to one or more of claims 6 to 8, wherein a device for dyeing is
provided which dyes the as yet unhydrated contact lens (CL), adhering to the male mould

half (2), in the iris region.
An apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the device for dyeing comprises a dyeing
tampon (8) which can be pressed onto the iris region of the contact lens (CL) in order to dye

that region.
