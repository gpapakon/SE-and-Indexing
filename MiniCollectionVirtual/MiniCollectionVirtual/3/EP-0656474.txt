<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injector for internal combustion engines has a nozzle body (10) with a valve seat (18) arranged on the combustion chamber side and an outwards opening valve needle (15) with a closing head (16), which has a closing cone (17) interacting with the valve seat (18). In the closing head (16) at least one spray hole (25), directed outwards to the lifting axis thereof, is arranged, which is opened by a control edge (24) on the nozzle body as a function of the fuel admission pressure. In order to minimise any deviation of the spray jet emerging from the spray hole (25) relative to the alignment of the spray hole, the spray hole (25) is divided into at least two or more parallel passages (52, 53), which are separated from one another by a dividing wall (55) and are successively exposed by the control edge (24) during the opening lift of the valve needle.

Fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion
engines of the outward-opening type with a valve member

(16, 20) which is displaceable in a bore of a nozzle body
(10) counter to the effect of a closing spring (40) by

the fuel pressure and has a piston-like valve head (16),
in which is arranged at least one spray hole (25) which

is oriented at a specific angle to the stroke axis of the
valve member and the mouth cross-section of which is

covered by the nozzle body when the valve member is in
the closed position and is continuously opened, during

the opening stroke, by a control edge (24) at that end of
the valve body which is located on the combustion-space

side, characterized in that the spray hole (25) is
subdivided by means of at least one thin partition (55)

into a plurality of parallel flow ducts (52, 53), the
mouths of which are opened in succession by the control

edge (24) during the opening stroke of the valve member
(16, 20), the released part flows (e, f) combining to

form a spray jet (g), the axis of which lies in or near
the orientation of the spray hole (25).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the spray hole (25) is formed from

two or more parallel ducts (52, 53) arranged one above
the other in the stroke axis of the valve member, and in

that the thickness of the partition (55) amounts to half
the width of one duct.
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the width of the ducts (52, 53) is

0.100 to 0.200 mm and the thickness of the partition (55)
is 0.050 to 0.100 mm. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the ducts (52, 53) have identical

cross-sections.
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of Claims
2 to 4, characterized in that the ducts (52, 53) have a

circular cross-section.
