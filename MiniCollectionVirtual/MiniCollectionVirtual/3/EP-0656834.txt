<ABSTRACT>
TTP dye sheets having a dye coat comprising a binder which comprises a mixture of a cellulosic polymer and a second polymer having, as at least 10 % of its monomeric units, a monomeric unit of formula (I): -(H2C-CXY)-, wherein X is H or methyl and Y is an optionally substituted phenyl group, a cyano group or an ester group of formula -CO2Z wherein Z is an optionally substituted C1 to C6 hydrocarbyl group provided that where Y is phenyl, the second polymer also has a substituted styrene and/or a non-styrene monomeric unit are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal transfer printing (TTP) dye 
sheet, in particular to a dye sheet having an improved dye binder. Thermal transfer printing is a printing process in which a dye is 
caused, by thermal stimuli, to transfer from a dye sheet to a receiver 
sheet thereby to form an image on the receiver sheet. In such a 
process, the dye sheet and receiver sheet are placed in intimate 
contact, the thermal stimuli are applied to the dye sheet to cause dye 
transfer and the dye sheet and receiver sheet are then separated. By 
applying the thermal stimuli to pre-determined areas in the dye sheet, 
the dye is selectively transferred to the receiver to form the desired 
image. The thermal stimuli may be provided by a programmable print head 
which is in contact with the dye sheet or by for example, a laser in a 
light-induced thermal transfer process (LITT). Dye-sheets conventionally comprise a substrate having on one 
surface thereof a dye coat which typically comprises a thermally 
transferable dye dispersed or dissolved in a binder. Dye-sheets may 
also comprise a backcoat to impart desirable properties for example, 
good handling and thermal characteristics to the dye sheet. Further, a 
primer or subbing layer may be employed between the substrate and the 
dye coat and/or the substrate and the backcoat for example to improve 
the adhesion of the coat to the substrate. Many materials have been suggested for use as the binder 
and reference may be made to EP-A-0 141 678, EP-A-0 469 723, US-A-4 946 826, 
JP-A-3264393 and JP-A-59199295. During the TTP process, application of a thermal stimulus to an 
area of the dye coat on the dye sheet heats that area of the sheet to a 
temperature typically in excess of 100Â°C as a result of which the dye in 
that area of the dye sheet is transferred to the receiver sheet. On 
removal of the thermal stimulus the tmperature of the heated area then 
decreases to the ambient operating temperature in the process. However, once the thermal stimulus is removed and the temperature 
of the heated area of the dye sheet is decreasing, there may be  
 
sufficient heat to cause unwanted, uncontrolled residual transfer of dye 
to the receiver sheet which may cause a reduction in image quality. 
This problem is referred to herein as low temperature thermal transfer. We have now found that by employing a dye sheet binder having a 
particular mixture of polymers, problems due to low temperature thermal 
transfer may be reduced or avoided and other significant advantages may
