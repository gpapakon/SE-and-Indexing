<ABSTRACT>
A mains pressure valve which comprises a main chamber (12) having an inlet chamber (11) for fluid and a discharge chamber (14) for fluid; a piston (17) located in the main chamber (12) which is movable into and out of sealing engagement with the outlet of the main chamber (12) and which defines above it an upper portion (40) of the main chamber (12); a port (35) in the upper portion (40) which permits fluid to flow therethrough; and actuation control (42) associated with the port to regulate the flow of fluid through the port. Upon actuation fluid in the upper portion (40) drains through port (35) allowing piston (17) to rise and mains pressure fluid passes from inlet chamber (11) through main chamber (12) and out discharge chamber (14). Fluid bleeds via flow valve (21) and (22) into upper portion (40) and as port (35) is closed piston (17) closes the valve after a predetermined period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mains pressure valve for a mains pressure water
system which, upon activation, will deliver a predetermined volume of
water.In this description, where the valve is described in respect of water, it
will be understood that other fluid could be used with the valve as well.Conventionally, where it is necessary to discharge a predetermined
amount of water, a header tank is commonly used with a controlling float
valve. Typically, this is required for toilets. The tank is sized to hold
a set amount of water. After each discharge the tank needs to be refilled
with an attendant delay between flushes. These tanks can be unsightly or
otherwise need to be safeguarded against vandalism and it is common to
locate them in the partitioning walls or ceilings of the urinal. Further,
particularly in large buildings, the combined weight of the many header
tanks requires substantial addition to the size of the foundations and
framework of the building. In view of the bulk of these tanks,
installation costs are increased. Accordingly, there was a need for a
mains pressure flushing system which would avoid the need for these
types of tanks.Valves have been proposed to fulfil this need which, upon actuation, allow
a predetermined volume of water to flow through the valve before
automatically closing or stopping the flow of water. However, such valves
to date have usually been large, cumbersome and required specially
adapted plumbing (such as larger diameter pipes, pressure regulators and
extra valves) for their proper operation. They are also expensive in
themselves and expensive to install. Such known valves may also be
unable to deliver a sufficient volume of water to flush as required. They
permit little adjustment for the volume of water to be delivered and cannot
readily provide the well-known "dual flush" capability. Australian patent number 577932 describes a self close flush valve
which is intended to operate at lower than mains pressure as one of
several similar valves, each servicing a separate toilet, where the water
supply for each is one large header tank. This valve allows the delivery of
a fixed volume of water and its particular advantage is stated to be that the
volume of water delivered can be easily varied. This valve is, however,
not appropriate for connection directly to a mains pressure water system.That valve has a principal valve which controls the flow of water
from the inlet to the outlet by the pressure of water in an inner chamber.

<CLAIMS>
A mains pressure valve comprising:

(a) a main chamber (12) having an inlet for fluid and an outlet for
fluid,
(b) a piston (17), whose perimeter divides the main chamber (12) into
first (40) and second (39) portions, located in the main chamber

(12) and moveable into and out of sealing engagement with the
outlet of the main chamber (12) and having an internal passageway

(20,23) which communicates between the first portion (40) of the
main chamber (12) and the inlet,
(c) a port (35) in the first portion (40) of the main chamber (12) which
permits fluid to flow therethrough,
(d) a valve (42) associated with the port (35) to regulate the flow of
fluid through the port,
(e) a discharge chamber (14) downstream of and communicating with
the outlet of the main chamber (12),
characterised in that
 there is provided:

(f) a non-return valve (36) located downstream of the discharge
chamber (14) and communicating therewith, the non-return valve

restricting fluid discharged from the outlet of the main chamber
(12) and through the non-return valve (36) from flowing backwards

through the outlet and into the main chamber (12), and impeding
fluid being discharged from the discharge chamber (14),
(g) a bypass passageway (13) communicating between the port (35) in
the first portion (40) of the main chamber and the discharge

chamber (14) upstream of the non-return valve (36),

and further 
characterised in that
 the piston (17) is not connected to the
non-return valve (36) and is movable independently thereof.
A valve according to claim 1 further comprising an inlet chamber
(11) communicating with the inlet of the main chamber (12). 
A valve according to claim 2 in which the piston (17) includes a
flow valve (21,22) located in the internal passageway (20,23) of

the piston (17) to regulate the passage of fluid from the inlet of the
main chamber (12) to the first portion (40) of the main chamber.
A valve according to claim 2 or claim 3 further comprising a stop
tap (15) located in the inlet chamber (11) and movable to vary the

amount of water flowing through the inlet chamber (11).
A valve according to any one of claims 1 to 4 further comprising
adjustment means (30,33) to control the distance of upward

movement of the piston (17) in the main chamber (12).
A valve according to claim 5 wherein the adjustment means
comprises a movable spindle (30) projecting into the first portion

(40) of the main chamber.
A valve according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the
discharge chamber (14) includes an air-vent (38).
A valve according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the piston
(17) further comprises a depending projection (45) of slightly

smaller diameter than the discharge chamber (14).
A valve according to any one of claims 1 to 8 further comprising
mechanical and/or electrical actuation means (29,43) to control

fluid flow in and through the valve (42).
