<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a pharmaceutically safer plasminogen-containing composition by efficiently 
deactivating contaminant viruses while minimizing the loss of plasminogenic activity. The process comprises treating a 

plasminogen-containing composition which is likely to be contaminated by viruses 
with a trialkyl phosphate in solution and eliminating the phosphate. Preferably the phosphate 

treatment is conducted under a weakly acidic condition. The elimination of the phosphate is 

followed by freeze drying and heat treatment in a dried state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing a 
high activity plasminogen-containing composition which 
comprises substantially inactivating viruses in a 
plasminogen-containing composition with a possibility of 
having viral contamination. When plasminogen is activated by a plasminogen 
activator such as urokinase or the like, it is converted into 
plasmin which lyses fibrin to cause fibrinolysis. Because of 
this, a possibility has been noticed for the clinical 
application of plasminogen as a drug for the treatment of 
fibrinolytic systems (a thrombolytic agent). Especially, 
great attention has been focused on the usefulness of a lysyl 
type plasminogen whose N-terminal is a lysyl residue. The lysyl type plasminogen is formed from a glutamyl 
type plasminogen, namely a plasminogen whose N-terminal is a 
glutamyl residue, when it is cut at a site between the 76 and 
77 position lysyl residues counting from the N-terminal. Since plasminogen is derived from human plasma, every 
plasminogen-containing composition has a possible danger of 
contamination with viruses such as hepatitis and AIDS 
viruses. Accordingly, with the aim of preventing  
 
transmission of such viruses, several processes have been 
proposed in which a plasma protein-containing composition is 
heated under a liquid condition (JP-A-55-145615, JP-A-56-139422 
and JP-A-56-106594, etc.), heated under a dry 
condition (International Patent Application published in 
Japan No. 58-500548, etc.) or contact-treated with trialkyl 
phosphate (JP-A-60-51116, etc.). However, it is probable 
that thermally stable viruses remain after the heat treatment 
and viruses having no envelope remain after the trialkyl 
phosphate treatment. In addition, the trialkyl phosphate 
treatment has another problem in that the protein activity 
decreases during the treatment. In order to overcome these problems, some processes 
have been proposed such as a process in which a heat 
treatment is carried out under a dry condition after a 
contact-treatment with trialkyl phosphate (EP-A-378208) and a 
process in which a contact-treatment with trialkyl 
phosphate and a heat treatment are simultaneously carried out 
under a liquid condition (JP-A-2-180833). Taking the abovementioned problems into 
consideration, the present inventors have conducted studies 
on the development of a process for producing plasminogen-containing 
compositions. Accordingly, the present invention 
provides a process for producing a plasminogen-containing 
composition having improved safety
