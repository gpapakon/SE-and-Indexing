<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method of making a coated abrasive article 
having a backing and an abrasive layer attached to a major surface thereof, the 
method including the step of impregnating the backing with an impregnating 
composition comprising an electrically conductive material. The resulting abrasive 
article is useful in reducing the accumulation of the static electric charge in the 
coated abrasive article during abrading of a workpiece. In the typical manufacturing process of coated abrasives, a first binder 
precursor, typically referred to as a make coat precursor, is applied to the front 
side of a backing. Next, a plurality of abrasive granules are projected into the 
make coat precursor and then the make coat precursor is at least partially cured. 
A size coat precursor is applied over the abrasive granules. Then the size coat 
precursor and, if necessary, the make coat precursor are fully cured to form a size 
coat and a make coat. The purpose of the make coat is to secure the abrasive 
granules to the backing. The purpose of the size coat is to further reinforce the 
abrasive granules. In a common alternative method for making coated abrasives, 
an abrasive layer is applied to the front side of a backing by slurry coating a slurry 
comprising a binder precursor and abrasive granules. The binder precursor is then 
cured. Typically, the curing process is done by thermal energy. For fibrous coated abrasive backings such as paper or nonwovens, the 
thermal curing tends to remove too much moisture from these backings causing 
them to become undesirably brittle and stiff. To alleviate this problem, after the 
make and size coats are thermally cured, the fibrous backing is saturated with 
water such that moisture is reintroduced into the fibrous backing to prevent the 
embrittlement problem. This process is referred to in the industry as 
"backtreating."  
 Coated abrasives unfortunately suffer from the generation of static 
electricity during their use for abrading and finishing wood and wood-like 
materials. Static electricity is generated by the constant separation of the abrasive 
product from the workpiece, the machinery drive rolls, idler rolls, and support pad 
for the abrasive product. The static electric problems tend to be more pronounced 
when abrading electrically insulating or semi-insulating workpieces, for example, 
wood (e.g., pine, oak, cherry, etc.), plastic, mineral (e.g., marble), the like (e.g., 
particle board or pressed board), or workpieces coated with an insulating
