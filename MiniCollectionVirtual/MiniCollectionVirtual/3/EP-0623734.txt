<ABSTRACT>
A composite article includes a plurality of laminates 30 each having structural fibers 
bonded in a matrix, and an adhesive film 32 disposed between and bonding together 

adjacent ones of the laminates 30. In an exemplary embodiment, the laminates 30 and the 
interleaved adhesive films 32 form a facesheet 28 which is joined to a core 34 for forming 

an impact resistant fan case impact liner 26a for a gas turbine engine. The impact liner 26a 
may be integrated with a sound suppression liner 26.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a fan case liner for gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to a composite article within the fan region thereof having improved impact 
resistance from foreign objects such as ice. In a gas turbofan jet engine powering an aircraft in flight, certain environmental 
conditions cause ice formation on the rotating fan blades and adjacent rotating components 
during engine operation. When this ice sheds, it is thrown radially outwardly and aft by the 
fan blades due to centrifugal force and impinges against the annular outer liners facing 
radially inwardly from the fan case. Accordingly, the fan case liners in this region of the 
engine are specifically configured for having increased strength for better resisting impact 
from the ice. Since the turbofan engine powers an aircraft in flight, the weight of the fan case 
liner is a significant factor affecting the overall weight of the engine and efficiency of 
operation of the aircraft. Accordingly, it is difficult to make an effective impact resistant 
fan case liner that is also lightweight. For the ever increasing size of modern aircraft 
turbofan engines with increasing diameter fans therein, the diameter of the fan case liner 
correspondingly increases which in turn increases its weight even further, with the weight 
thereof becoming even more significant in obtaining efficient operation of the aircraft. Furthermore, the impact resistant liner is typically integrated into a conventional 
honeycomb sandwich construction, sound suppression liner which similarly attaches into 
the fan case that surrounds the fan. The impact resistant liner must therefore be 
structurally compatible with the sound suppression liner while still maintaining effective 
impact resistance with as little weight as possible. In US Patent 5,160,248 by J. P. Clarke, entitled "Fan Case Liner for a Gas Turbine 
Engine With Improved Foreign Body Impact Resistance," assigned to the present assignee, 
several embodiments of an improved fan case liner having integrated portions for impact 
resistance and sound suppression are disclosed. The integrated liner includes a multi-ply  
 
facesheet supported by one or more honeycomb cores and surrounded by a backsheet. The 
facesheet includes multiple plies of fiberglass or the like impregnated with an epoxy resin 
and cured for forming an impact resistant material. The face sheet is joined to a 
honeycomb layer of aluminum, for example, by a fiber-reinforced adhesive. In the preferred 
embodiment

an annular fan case impact liner (26a) for a gas turbine 

engine (10) adapted to be disposed downstream from a fan 
(10) thereof, and wherein said facesheet (28) faces 

radially inwardly for being impacted by foreign objects 
thrown from said fan during rotation thereof; said liner 

further comprising: 

a backsheet (40) radially outwardly of said second 
core (36); and 
another adhesive film (32) disposed between and 
bonding together said backsheet and said second core.

bonding together said second septum and said second core, 

and said second septum and said third core; and 
said backsheet (40) being joined by said adhesive film 
(32) to said third core instead of said second core. 
A liner combination according to claim 5 wherein 
said third core has a third compressive strength, said 

first compressive strength being greater than each of said 
second and third compressive strengths.
