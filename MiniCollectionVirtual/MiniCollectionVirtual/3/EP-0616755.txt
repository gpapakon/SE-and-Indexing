<ABSTRACT>
A plasma torch is equipped with a preferably axial magnetic field in order to rotate the arc around the torch's centre axis. One or more bodies (4) of a ferromagnetic material are placed in or along the centre axis of the torch and with one end close to the arc's area of operation. The ferromagnetic body (4) will concentrate the magnetic field in the arc zone and if desired conduct the magnetic field from an area with a stronger axial magnetic field to the arc's area of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a plasma torch device equipped with an 
axial magnetic field in order to rotate the arc around the 
torch's centre axis. Plasma torches are mainly designed according to two principles. 
In one embodiment two or more tube electrodes are used located 
coaxially outside one another. In a second embodiment two or 
more tube electrodes are used wherein the electrodes are 
located coaxially opposite one another. The electrodes are 
connected to an electrical power supply and can be supplied 
with either alternating current or direct current. Gas is 
supplied to the torch, usually through or between the 
electrodes. A high-temperature plasma is formed by means of the 
gas which is heated by the electric arc which extends between 
the electrodes. There are known plasma torches equipped with a magnetic field. 
From German patent DE 1 300 182 there is known a plasma torch 
with two tube electrodes located coaxially outside each other. 
A coil to which direct current is supplied is placed around the 
external electrode. It produces an axial magnetic field in the 
torch which causes the arc to rotate around the torch's centre 
axis. The patent also describes a plasma torch with two tube 
electrodes located coaxially opposite each other. A coil is 
located in each of the hollow electrodes producing a magnetic 
field which causes the arc to rotate. From US 4 390 772 is known a plasma torch device where the 
magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator is 
conducted to the arc's area of operation through a body formed 
from a magnetic material provided with cooling channels. The 
plasma arc is thus forced to rotate. In plasma torches not only 
the rotation of the plasma arc is of importance but also the 
ability to make adjustments to the magnetic field in the arc's  
 
area of operation to keep the arc in correct position in 
relation to the end faces of the electrodes. However, this 
feature is not disclosed in this patent. From DE 2 913 464 is known a plasma torch device with two 
electrodes located coaxially opposite each other. A coil is 
placed around the torch body and generates an axial magnetic 
field in the plasma zone. By moving either the coil or the 
movable electrode the length of the arc can be adjusted. In the 
arc's area of operation a ferromagnetic body will reinforce the 
field and have a much greater effect on the adjustment of the 
arc. However, this feature is not disclosed in the patent. The object of the magnetic field is primarily to provide an 
electromagnetic

<CLAIMS>
A plasma torch device having a central axis, fitted with means for generating an 
axial magnetic field in the arc's area of operation in order to rotate 

the arc around the torch's centre axis, wherein the 
plasma torch device further comprises one or more 

bodies of a ferromagnetic material placed in or along the 

torch's centre axis, said body or bodies being in the form of a part 
or an element incorporated in the torch and being cooled by the 

provision of channels for a cooling medium or by being located 
close to cooled parts in the torch, and wherein one end of 

the ferromagnetic body or bodies is located in or 
near the arc's area of operation in order to reinforce said 

magnetic field, said body or bodies being movable in the axial 
direction in order to adjust the operation parameters of the 

arc.
