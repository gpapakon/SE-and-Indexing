<ABSTRACT>
The combing machine contains a row of combing heads (1) which are assigned a driveshaft (2) extending parallel to the longitudinal direction of the row. The combing heads (1) are followed by a drawframe, the rollers (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of which are arranged horizontally and at right angles to the driveshaft (2). A coiler (9) and a can plate (10) are rotatable about vertical axes. The simplified drive devices for the rollers (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of the drawframe and for the coiler (9) and the can plate (10) contain two angle drives (11, 12, 13; 30, 31, 32) each with an offset toothed belt (12; 31). The first angle drive (11, 12, 13) connects the driveshaft (2) to a drawframe driveshaft (14) parallel to the rollers (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of the drawframe. The second angle drive (30, 31, 32) connects a shaft (26), parallel to the drawframe driveshaft (14), to a vertical driveshaft (33) for the coiler (9) and for the can plate (10).

A combing machine, with a row of combing heads (1) 
to which is associated a drive shaft (2) extending 

parallel to the longitudinal direction of the row, 
with a drafting arrangement whose cylinders (3, 4, 

5, 6, 7) are arranged approximately horizontally 
and at a right angle to the longitudinal direction 

of the row of combing heads (1), and with a can 
plate (10) and a funnel wheel (9) which are 

rotatable about the vertical axes, characterized 
in that between the said drive shaft (2) and a 

drafting arrangement drive shaft (14) which is 
parallel to the cylinders (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of the 

drafting arrangement there is arranged a first V-drive 
(11, 12, 13) with a first crossed toothed 

belt (12) and that between a shaft (26) which is 
parallel to the drafting arrangement drive shaft 

(14) and a vertical drive shaft (33) for the can 

plate (10) and for the funnel wheel (9) there is 
arranged a second V-drive (30, 31, 32) with a 

second crossed toothed belt (31). 
A combing machine as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that at least one of the two 

crossed toothed belts (12, 31) is arranged in an 
enclosed chamber (45) and that means (47) are 

provided for maintaining a pressure above 
atmospheric in the chamber. 
A combing machine as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the cylinders (3, 4, 5, 6, 

7) of the drafting arrangement are driven by the 
drafting arrangement drive shaft (14) via further 

toothed belts (15, 19, 23, 24, 25, 28).  
 
A combing machine as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the funnel wheel (9) 

is driven from the vertical drive shaft (33) via a 
V-belt (36). 
A combing machine as claimed in claims 2, 3 and 4, 
characterized in that at least a part of the 

further toothed belts (15, 19, 23, 24, 25, 28) and 
V-belts (36) are also arranged in the enclosed 

chamber (45, 46). 
A combing machine as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that a driving belt pulley (37) 

for the V-belt (36) which is disposed on the 
vertical shaft (33) is arranged as a variable 

drive disk. 
A combing machine as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the can plate (10) 

is driven by the vertical drive shaft (33) via a 
step-down gear (34) and a chain (35).
