<ABSTRACT>
A device for filling a receptacle closable by means of a lid with an inert gas has a filling head which, on its end face confronting the lid, has a seal which can be laid around a hole in the lid. Connected to the filling head is at least one conduit, by means of which the space sealed off by the seal between the filling head and the lid can be evacuated and can be filled with the inert gas.

<CLAIMS>
A system comprising a container (4) with a cover (3) 
having a hole (28) to be sealed with a sealing plate (16), 

and an apparatus for evacuating said container having a housing 
(2) which has a seal (6) on its front facing the cover 

(3) and to which at least one pipe (22, 23) is connected for 
evacuating the space sealed by the seal (6) between the housing 

(2) and the cover (3), a piston (12) being provided on 
the front of the housing (2) facing the cover (3), said piston 

being axially displaceable in an evacuable cylinder space 
(10) in the housing (2) and having the sealing plate (16) detachably 

fastenable thereto, characterized in that a carrier 
(15) with a magnet (19) for carrying the sealing plate is 

fastened to the piston (12) within the seal (6), the carrier 
(15) has a ring shoulder (17) which, when the cylinder space 

(10) is subjected to atmospheric pressure, secures the carrier 
(15), by lying against a ring (9) fastened to the housing 

(2), from falling out or being pulled out when the housing 
(2) is lifted off after the evacuated container (4) is 

sealed, and a protective gas source is provided to be connected 
with the space sealed by the seal (6) between the 

housing (2) and the cover (3). 
The system of claim 1, characterized in that pipes 
(22, 23) are connected to the filling head (2), one for 

evacuating and one for filling the space between the filling 
head (2) and the cover (3). 
The system of claim 1, characterized in that a seal 
(20) is provided for sealing the sealing plate (16) from the 

cover (3). 
The system of claim 3, characterized in that the seal 
(20) is fastened to the sealing plate (16). 
The system of claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the 
seal (20) forms a peripheral projection (29) which is spaced  

 
from the hole (28) when the sealing plate (16) is disposed on 

the cover (3). 
The system of any of the above claims, characterized 
in that the container (4) with the cover (3) is designed for 

receiving an original container. 
The system of any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that a support form (32) is provided for receiving a container 

(4) to be filled with protective gas, the inside wall 
(33) of the support form (32) being adapted to the outside 

dimensions of the container (4) so as to form a slit-shaped 
space (34) between the inside wall (33) and the container 

(4), and the space (34) being evacuable together with the 
container (4). 
The system of claim 7, characterized in that the container 
(4) has a radially outward extending edge (31), and 

the support form (32) has on its edge (36) a seal (37) to lie 
against the edge (31) of the container (4).
