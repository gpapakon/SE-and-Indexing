<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a novel thin and flexible
radio frequency (RF) tag that comprises a semiconductor

circuit that has logic, memory, and radio frequency
circuits, connected to an antenna with all

interconnections placed on a single plane of wiring
without crossovers. The elements of the package

(substrate, antenna, and laminated covers) are flexible.
The elements of the package are all thin. The tag is

thin and flexible, enabling a unique range of
applications including: RF ID tagging of credit cards,

passports, admission tickets, and postage stamps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio frequency circuit and
memory in a thin flexible package. More specifically, the
invention relates to a thin flexible radio frequency circuit
used as a radio frequency tag.Radio Frequency Identification
(RF ID) is just one of many identification technologies for
identifying objects. The heart of the RF ID system lies in an
information carrying tag. The tag functions in response to a
coded RF signal received from a base station. Typically,
the tag reflects the incident RF carrier back to the base
station. Information is transferred as the reflected signal
is modulated by the tag according to its programmed
information protocol.The tag consists of a semiconductor chip having RF circuits,
logic, and memory. The tag also has an antenna, often a
collection of discrete components, capacitors and diodes, for
example, a battery in the case of active tags, a substrate
for mounting the components, interconnections between
components, and a means of physical enclosure. One variety
of tag, passive tags, has no battery. They derive their
energy from the RF signal used to interrogate the tag. In
general, RF ID tags are manufactured by mounting the
individual elements to a circuit card. This is done by using
either short wire bond connections or soldered connections
between the board and the circuit elements: chip, capacitors,
diodes, antenna. The circuit card may be of epoxy-fiberglass
composition or ceramic. The antennas are generally loops of 
wire soldered to the circuit card or consist of metal etched
or plated on a circuit card. The whole assembly may be
enclosed in a plastic box or molded into a three dimensional
plastic package.While the application of RF ID technology is not as
widespread as other ID technologies, bar code for example, RF
ID is on its way to becoming a pervasive technology in some
areas, notably vehicle identification.Growth in RF ID has been inhibited by the high cost of tags,
the bulkiness of most of the tags, and problems of tag
sensitivity and range. A typical tag costs in the $5 to $10
range.Companies have focused on niche applications. Some prior art
is used to identify railway boxcars. These tags tend to be
quite large and are made of discrete components on circuit
boards mounted in solid, non-flexible casings. RF tags are
now used in the automatic toll industry, e.g. on thruway and
bridge tolls. RF tags are being tested for uses as
contactless fare cards for buses. Employee identification
badges and security badges have been produced. Animal
