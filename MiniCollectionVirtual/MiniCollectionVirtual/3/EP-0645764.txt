<ABSTRACT>
A phase modulated servo method and apparatus are provided 
for use in a disk file. The disk file includes at least one disk 

mounted for rotation about an axis and the disk has at least one 
disk surface for storing data. At a predefined location of the 

disk surface a series of servo tracks of a predetermined high 
gain servo pattern are written. The predetermined high gain 

servo pattern includes 360° phase difference information within 
each data cylinder. The servo tracks are detected for 

identifying servo phase information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a phase modulated
servo positioning system in a direct access storage device (DASD)
and more particularly to a phase modulated servo method
for use with transducer heads having instabilities.Computers often include auxiliary memory storage units
having media on which data can be written and from which data can
be read for later use. Disk drive units incorporating stacked,
commonly rotated rigid magnetic disks are used for storage of
data in magnetic form on the disk surfaces. Data is recorded in
concentric, radially spaced data information tracks arrayed on
the surfaces of the disks. Transducer heads driven in a path
toward and away from the drive axis write data to the disks and
read data from the disks.All DASD units must have a method to position each data head
over the proper radial location to write a track and again, to
position it very close to the same location to read the track.
With the higher level files using a voice coil type of actuator,
a feedback mechanism must be provided to locate and stably hold
the head on a given track. Typically, track accessing and track
following are provided utilizing a magnetically written pattern
in the DASD unit. A dedicated servo system employs one surface
of one of the disks in the DASD on which to have all the tracking
and access information. A sector servo system uses small
portions of tracks between each or between several sectors on 
each track of each data surface to provide the tracking and
access information. A hybrid servo system uses both to obtain
advantages of each type of servo.Document EP-A-0 129 708 describes a phase modulated servo
system for a disk file in which servo information is recorded
using a plurality of constant frequency fields each having a
phase shift between tracks. Servo information is encoded in the
phase of the servo pattern instead of the amplitude of the servo
signal lobes. Multiple phase shifts per track are used to make
the signal constantly varying with transducer head displacement.
Phase is measured modulo 360° such that the phase of a given
filed go through 360° every M tracks. By using several fields
having different values of M, coarse, medium and fine position
resolution can be obtained with the same servo pattern and
demodulation scheme.Magneto-resistive (MR) heads are a great advancement in
read/write technology for DASD; however, the MR head's worst
characteristics is head instability. The term head instability
is used to describe a number of readback waveform
