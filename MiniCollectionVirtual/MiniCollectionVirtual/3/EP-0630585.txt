<ABSTRACT>
In order to test the draw resistance of filter rods, a measuring head (1) is provided which has a measuring chamber (4) receiving the filter rods (2) which are to be tested. Arranged in the measurement chamber (4) is a sleeve (6) which sealingly encloses the outer wrapping of the respective filter rod (2) which is to be tested. Whereas one end (17) of the measurement chamber (4) is open towards the atmosphere, a pressurised container (22) is connected to the other end and has a pressure different from the ambient pressure. The change in pressure in the pressurised container (22) over the course of time is measured by a pressure sensor (23) as a yardstick for the draw resistance of the filter rod (2). This method has the advantage that the draw resistance of filter rods or other rod-shaped articles in the tobacco processing industry can be measured very reliably, accurately and reproducibly.
