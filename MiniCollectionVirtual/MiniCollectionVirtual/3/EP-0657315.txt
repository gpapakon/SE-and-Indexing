<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to air 
conditioning assemblies for industrial vehicles, of the 
type comprising a condenser with associated air fan for 
condensation of the refrigerating fluid of the 
conditioning assembly. In the application of such air conditioning 
assemblies to industrial vehicles which are intended to 
operate in torrid climates, for instance at tropical 
latitudes under environment temperature between 40°C 
and 50°C and more, the condenser normally sized with 
thermal exchange surfaces suitable for more temperate 
climates (such as for instance the West European area) 
is inadequate for keeping the delivery pressure of the 
refrigerating fluid at an acceptable level without 
jeopardising the reliability of the compressor of the 
air conditioning assembly. The delivery pressure of the 
refrigerating fluid, normally an ecologic refrigerating 
fluid R134a, already higher than 20 bar at continental 
temperatures, is actually further increased at tropical 
temperatures. In order to solve this problem, the most immediate 
solution would consist of further increasing the 
surface of the condenser, for instance from normal 
values of 16-20 dm2, to at least 24 dm2 and further. 
Such a surface increase involves however an appreciable 
encumbrance increase of the condenser-air fan unit, 
normally installed in an area of the vehicle power unit 
(traditionally in proximity of a front wheel inner 
fender) wherein the available space is very narrow. For 
this reason the increase of the condenser surface would 
imply huge modifications of the vehicle, and related 
cost and standard inconveniences.  
 US-A-3,479,834 discloses an air conditioning system of 
the above-mentioned type, comprising a second condenser 
placed parallely to and in close proximity of the first 
condenser. The second condenser, which may be similar 
to the first condenser, is connected thereto through a 
circuit in series of the refrigerating fluid. This known construction, further to being relatively 
complicated owing to the fact that the two condensers 
have not necessarily the same structure, involves low 
performance and reliability of the air conditioning 
assembly owing to increased refrigerant pressure loss 
in the series-connected circuit. Consequently, such a 
construction is not suitable for operation at high 
environmental temperatures (over 47-50°C).  
 The object of the present invention is to give a 
simple, practical and functional solution to the above 
mentioned problem, enabling an easy adaptation of an
