<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and compounds for 
controlling inflammatory processes in humans through mediation of 
inflammatory cell proliferation. More particularly, the present 
invention is a method for suppressing T-lymphocytes using a class of 
novel compounds. Compounds which retard the production of cytokines such as 
interleukin-2 (IL-2) are known. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 
4,764,503 assigned to Sandoz Ltd., Basel, Switzerland, describes a 
compound generically referred to as Cyclosporin A (hereinafter 
referred to as "CsA"), and U.S. Patent No. 4,894,366 assigned to 
Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan, describes a compound they 
designate as "FK506." Both CsA and FK 506 are claimed to inhibit IL-2 
production and bind to cellular receptor proteins that possess 
Peptidyl Prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) activity (Johansson et al., 1990, 
Transplantation 50:10017). It was initially postulated by those skilled in the art that the 
specific binding by such compounds to PPIase type proteins led to 
inhibition of the protein's isomerase activity which, in turn, led to 
inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Thus, these PPIase type proteins 
were referred to as "immunophilins", with the cellular receptor 
proteins that bound to CsA and FK506 being referred to as 
"cyclophllin" and "FK506 binding protein", respectively. FK506 
binding protein is also simply referred to as "FKBP" (Harding et al., 
1989, Nature 341:758).  Recent publications report that the inhibition of PPIase activity, 
in and of itself, is not sufficient for immunosuppressant activity. 
However, there is support in the literature that inhibitory binding to 
PPIase-type enzymes probably contributes to ultimate T-cell 
suppression (Sigal et al. 1991, J. Exp. Med. 173:619). This disclosure presents a new class of synthetic compounds 
that both suppress the proliferation of T-cells and inhibit the 
isomerase activity of the FKBP-type of PPIases. CsA, a cyclic undecapeptide, has received FDA approval for use 
as an adjunct to organ transplant procedures. However, CsA is 
administered with caution due to its known toxicity. Currently, CsA is 
prescribed in situations where the risks of non treatment outweigh 
the risks of its therapeutic complications. As a result, efforts to expand the application of CsA into non 
life threatening indications such as chronic maintenance of 
autoimmune disorders have been limited by the well-known side 
effects of this drug. The use of CsA leads to a variety of disorders 
including: nephrotoxicity, such
