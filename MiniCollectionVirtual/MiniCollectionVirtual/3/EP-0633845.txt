<ABSTRACT>
A seat (10) has a spring arrangement (36) that allows the resiliency of the seat (10) to be adjusted at will. For that purpose, an at least approximately horizontal swivelling lever (38) with two arms is arranged on the back element (34) of the seat (10) and can pivot around a central bearing axis (40). An at least approximately horizontal tension spring (48) is secured by one of its end sections (50) to one arm (44) of the swivelling lever (38), whereas its other end section (54) is secured to a fastening section (56) of a supporting lever (58). The fastening section (56) is at least approximately aligned with the bearing axis (40). The supporting lever (58) can swivel on the back element (34) and is hingedly linked by its fastening section (56) to one element (18) of a crossbar stand (16).

Seat, in particular vehicle seat, having a spring 
device (36) of which the springing characteristic can be 

adjusted as required, the seat (10) exhibiting an L-shaped 
base arrangement (30) with a floor element (32) 

and a backrest element (34) projecting upwards from the 
floor element (32), and a scissors-type framework (16) 

being provided between the floor element (32) and the 
seat panel (12) of the seat (10), characterized in that 

a two-armed pivot lever (38) is mounted on the backrest 
element (34) such that it can be pivoted about a central 

bearing spindle (40), a spring device (36) which exhibits 
at least one tension spring (48) being fixed by means of 

one end section (50) on one arm (44) of said pivot lever, 
and the second end section (54) of said spring device 

(36) being fixed, by means of the bearing spindle (40), 
on a fastening section (56) of a supporting lever (58) in 

such a manner that it is at least virtually aligned 
axially, which supporting lever is provided in the 

vicinity of the first arm (44), which exhibits the spring 
device (36), of the pivot lever (38) and is mounted 

pivotably, by means of a bearing section (60) provided at 
one end, on the backrest element (34) and is connected in 

an articulated manner by means of its second end to the 
scissors-type framework (16), the pivot lever (38) and 

the at least one tension spring (48) being provided at 
least virtually horizontally in the normal rest position 

of the seat (10), and the second arm (46) of the pivot 
lever (38) being designed with an actuating grip (76) in 

order to adjust the springing behaviour. 
Seat according to Claim 1, characterized in that  
 

the supporting lever (58) is mounted on the backrest 
element (34) such that it can be pivoted in a linearly 

displaceable manner. 
Seat according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the spring device (36) exhibits at least one tension 

spring (48) with a large spring constant. 
Seat according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a damping device (84) is provided 

at least virtually parallel to the spring device (36), 
between the pivot lever (38) and the supporting lever 

(58). 
Seat according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the fastening section (56) of the 

supporting lever (58) is connected in an articulated 
manner to an end section (68) of a central element (18) 

of the scissors-type framework (16), which central 
element is mounted pivotably, by means of its opposite 

second end section (69), on the floor element (32) of the 
base arrangement (30), the scissors-type framework (16) 

exhibiting, in addition to the central element (18), two 
strip elements (22) which are provided laterally next to 

the central element (18) and are connected to one 
another forming a plane which crosses the plane of the 

central element (18), by means of a connecting element 
(24) which bears on the central element (18).
