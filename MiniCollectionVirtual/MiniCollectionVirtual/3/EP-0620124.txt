<ABSTRACT>
A planographic printing plate in which a design 
pattern is realized in a part of the back surface of a 

support for the planographic printing plate without any 
adverse influence on a photosensitive resin layer on the 

front surface thereof. After an aluminum support with a 
thickness of 0.24 mm is cleaned by degreasing and etching, an 

electrolytic aqueous solution is prepared to contain the 
nitric acid concentration of 10 g/l and the aluminum ion 

concentration of 7 g/l. In an electrolytic treatment cell 5, 
the back surface of the aluminum support is arranged so as to 

be faced to an electrode. A 1 mm-thick masking plate formed 
of an insulating material punched to provided openings with 

arbitrary shapes is brought into close contact with the back 
surface of the aluminum support so that the back surface of 

the aluminum support is covered with the masking plate. A 
carbon plate with a thickness of 50 mm is used as the 

electrode. Further, the electrolytic aqueous solution is 
supplied from a blowout nozzle toward the masking plate at a 

flow rate of 50 m/min. The electrode and the aluminum 
support are connected to an electric source through a cable 

so that the aluminum support 7 was partially roughened 
electrochemically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planographic printing
plate and a method of manufacturing a support therefor and
particularly relates to a planographic printing plate in
which a part of a surface (back surface) not subjected to
roughening treatment for application of a photosensitive
resin layer in a planographic printing plate is roughened
electrochemically to realize a rough surface of an arbitrary
shape (for example, a design pattern) in the surface (back
surface), and a method of manufacturing a support therefor.A planographic printing plate is mainly composed of an
aluminum or aluminum alloy support (hereinafter simply
referred to as "aluminum plate") and a photosensitive resin
layer. Heretofore, so-called graining treatment for
roughening the whole of a surface of a support to be brought
into close contact with a photosensitive resin layer is
carried out in order to make the adhesion between the support
and the photosensitive resin layer good and give water
retentivity to a non-image portion.As specific means for this graining treatment, there are
mechanical graining methods such as a sandblasting method, a 
ball graining method, a brush graining method using a Nylon
brush and an abrasive agent/water slurry, a honing graining
method of blowing an abrasive agent/water slurry onto a
surface of a support at a high pressure, etc., and chemical
graining methods for roughening a surface with an etching
agent formed of an alkaline agent or an acidic agent or a
mixture thereof. There are further known electrochemical
graining methods described in Japanese Patent Unexamined
