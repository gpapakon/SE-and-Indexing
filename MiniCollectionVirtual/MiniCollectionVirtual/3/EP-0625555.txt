<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a new method of curing a polyester 
powder coating composition. The resin is cured by the use of an 

organotitanium or organozirconium derivative of an alkanolamine 

having the formula M₃[(OR)₃N]₄ or O[M(OR)₃N]
₂ or 
R¹[OM(OR)₃N]
x
 where M represents Ti or Zr, R represents a divalent 
aliphatic radical, x is 1 to 4 and R¹ is a saturated hydrocarbyl group or 

a group containing one or more ether linkages. The method is suitable 
for use with both hydroxyl-rich and carboxyl-rich polyester resins and 

the cured coatings have desirable physical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder coating compositions based on 
polyester resins and in particular to the use of certain organotitanium 
or organozirconium compounds to cure polyester resin powder coating 
compositions. Coating compositions comprising powdered thermo-setting 
compositions are increasingly used for the formation of highly durable 
and decorative finishes. Such compositions, usually known as powder 
coating compositions are frequently based on polyester resins which 
can be prepared by the reaction of polyhydric alcohols and polybasic 
acids and in which the molar ratio of alcohol to acid can be adjusted to 
produce resins which contain an excess of hydroxyl groups over acid 
groups (hydroxyl-rich resins) or resins which contain an excess of acid 
groups over hydroxyl groups (carboxyl-rich resins). The carboxyl-rich resins are frequently cured by cross-linking 
with an isocyanurate such as triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) to 
produce durable coatings ideally suitable for exterior use. However, 
there is now a desire to reduce the use of triglycidyl isocyanurate. Cross-linking of carboxyl-rich resins with epoxy resins such as 
resins based on bisphenol A is known to produce resins which are 
frequently called hybrid resins. However these resins do not possess 
the same properties or exterior durability as those produced by crosslinking 
with triglycidyl isocyanurate. Coatings having good exterior durability can also be produced 
by cross-linking hydroxyl-rich resins with isocyanates. These 
isocyanates may be blocked, for example with caprolactam, to prevent 
premature reaction with the polyester. However, there is now a 
general trend within the coating industry to avoid the use of 
caprolactam-blocked isocyanates when possible. It is an object of the invention to provide an alternative method 
for curing polyester resin powder coating compositions which is 
suitable for hydroxyl-rich and/or carboxyl-rich resins and provides 
cured coatings with desirable properties. According to the invention a method of curing a powder coating 
composition comprises reacting a polyester resin with an  
 
organotitanium compound or an organozirconium compound which is 
a derivative of an alkanolamine and has the formula M₃[(OR)₃N]₄ or 
the formula O[M(OR)₃N]₂ or the formula R¹[O M(OR)₃N]x in which, 
in each formula, M represents titanium or zirconium, R represents a 
divalent aliphatic radical, x is 1 to 4 and R¹ is a saturated hydrocarbyl 
group or a group containing one or more ether linkages. The
