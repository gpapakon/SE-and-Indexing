<ABSTRACT>
A soap bar composition comprises a first synthetic anionic surfactant; a second synthetic surfactant selected from a second anionic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant and mixtures thereof; optionally free fatty acid, optionally soap and a silicone compound or compounds having a viscosity of between 10,000 and 200,000 centistokes. Replacement of soap by milder synthetic surfactants results in compositions which are softer, stickier and consequently more difficult to process. The addition of the silicone compound(s) improves the processability of such compositions into bars.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soap bar compositions in
which most or all of the soap has been replaced by other
surfactants. Such compositions, in which significant
amounts of soap have been removed, are softer, stickier
and accordingly more difficult to process into bars. The
present invention relates, in particular, to the use of
small amounts of silicone or mixtures of silicones of
defined viscosity (i.e., centistokes) which allow the
detergent bars to be more efficiently processed.Traditionally, soap has been utilized as a skin cleaner.
Soap is, however, a very harsh chemical. The use of soap,
especially in cold climates, can result in irritated and
cracked skin. Benefits which arise from the use of soap
include lower cost, ease of manufacture into bars and good
lathering properties.Thus, there is a balance between, on the one hand,
replacing soap with milder surfactants, and, on the other
hand, maintaining the ease of manufacturing associated
with use of soap.If the amount and type of milder replacement
surfactants which are added to the composition are too
great, the soap pellets (i.e., chips) formed during
manufacture (i.e., formed after mixing the ingredients,
solidifying on a chill roll, and refining to form chips)
will be too "soft". That is to say, the pellets or
chips/noodles will melt on a valve used to transfer the 
chips to storage in a container/silo. Clogging the
machinery such that the chips cannot be readily stored
means that the process cannot be stopped and chips cannot
be stored until a future time when the chips will be
further mixed, refined, extruded, cut and stamped.
That is, failure to allow storage means that the first
part of the process cannot be run as a batch process
(where chips can be stored) and must be run from mixing of
ingredients until bar extrusion and stamping. This
present invention is directed to those compositions which
can be readily processed from chip formation to silo
storage thereby allowing an intermediate storage step.Typically such compositions are those in which the amount
of soap in the composition is very low relative to
surfactant, i.e., at level less than 25% by weight of the
composition, usually less than 15% by weight.Another way of looking at the problem is to determine
when the composition of the pellets is sufficiently tacky
that they clog machinery and lower throughput levels
(i.e., rate of plodded bars coming out of a plodder) to
economically unacceptable rates.In applicants' co-pending application S/N 08/005716, filed
