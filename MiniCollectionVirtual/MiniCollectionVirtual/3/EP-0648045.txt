<ABSTRACT>
An exhibit explaining system, that enables a plurality of visitors to receive an 
explanation of an exhibit at their own pace, includes spectacle-type displays (51-1 

to 51-10), thc frequencies (f1 to f10) of carrier waves of which are set to be different 
from each other. Image generating devices (61-1 to 61-10) are provided to 

correspond to the spectacle-type displays (51-1 to 51-10). When an explanation 
request button (52-1) of the spectacle-type display (51-1) is operated, a VTR (76-1) 

of the image generating device (61-1) with the corresponding channel is caused to 
produce a signal which is output from a transmitter-receiver circuit (72-1) to the 

spectacle-type display (51-1) through an antenna 71-1 on a radio wave. In the 
spectacle-type display (51-1), this radio wave is demodulated to enable an image to 

be observed on an LCD thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to system for explaining exhibits. Such systems may be
used in, for example, museums, art galleries, etc.DE-A-35 17 818 discloses a system for providing to visitors audio and/or video
information about exhibits in an exhibition. Each visitor carries an apparatus storing,
for example on a CD, audio and/or video information about exhibits in the exhibition.
Each exhibit has a transmitter which transmits a coded signal specific to that exhibit.
The coded signal calls up from the CD the information appropriate to the exhibit.GB-A-2 195 868 discloses a method of broadcasting map information in which
a plurality of transmitter located in different regions and broadcasting on a number of
different frequencies with adjacent transmitters broadcasting on difference frequencies,
broadcast map information relating to the particular region in which the transmitter is
sited. A multiplicity of portable receivers are provided, each capable of receiving
broadcasts from any of the transmitters and being able to automatically or manually to
select reception from that transmitter in whose region the receiver is sited at a given
time, and each receiver includes means for displaying a map generated from map
information broadcast by the transmitter.WO 91/06158 discloses a recorded audio message delivery system for use in
museums or tourist attractions. The system supports multiple messages for example,
one message per exhibit and a user operated message player may be programmed to
receive messages in one of a plurality of languages. The messages may be transmitted,
for example, on different frequencies of the FM band to be received and played by the
receiver/message player. Messages are played without regard for sequence at the
demand of the user who may choose any message by keyboard operation of a panel of
the receiver. Thus, for example, by pressing key #5 the user may hear the message
relating to exhibit #5 in the language for which the receiver/player is programmed.
Frequencies may be reused in different locations of the museum or attraction.EP-A 0 559 406, EP-A-0 344 881 and US-A-5 060 062 discloses various head-mounted
display systems for presenting image information to a viewer. When viewing a museum or art gallery exhibit (or the like), not only is the
exhibit directly viewed, but an explanation plate is often provided which describes the
exhibit. In this case visitors can read the explanation plate to improve comprehension
of the exhibit. A method of providing an audible explanation from a
