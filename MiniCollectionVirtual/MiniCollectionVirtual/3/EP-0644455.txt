<ABSTRACT>
A light-sensitive photographic silver halide material is disclosed 
comprising a support and on one or both sides thereof at least one 

silver halide emulsion layer, at least one gelatin antistress layer 
and, optionally, a substantially gelatin free antistatic surface 

layer coated thereover, characterised in that said emulsion layer(s) 
comprise(s) at least one synthetic clay. As a result the said 

material is less sensitive to roller marks in automatic processing 
machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a rapidly processable light-sensitive 
silver halide photographic material. As is well known in the field of radiography, there is a general 
trend to enhance the speed of processing. Therefore interest has 
been focused on rapid access of radiographs, being vital in 
diagnosis. By the manufacturing of films suitable for rapid 
processing applications an ideal balance has to be sought concerning 
the thickness of the coated hydrophilic layers and the obtained 
sensitivity within a short processing time. E.g. thicker gelatin 
layers provide a sufficient absorption of processing chemicals in 
favour of the degree of development which is attainable within short 
development times of e.g. about 12 seconds or less. An inevitable 
disadvantage however is the longer drying time required for thicker 
coatings as the water absorption is also enhanced in the rinsing 
stage of the processing cycle. On the other hand thinner, 
sufficiently hardened coatings may be dried within very short times. Rapid processing conditions that can alternatively be applied 
are development processing at higher pH and higher temperatures of 
e.g. 30 to 40Â°C, to accelerate the said processing. However thin coated layers as well as high temperature 
processing or processing in a developer medium having a higher pH 
bring about deterioration of the photographic images obtained. 
Especially in automatic processors it frequently occurs that the 
pressure resistance of the photographic materials is insufficient. 
In that case so-called roller marks appear due to the uneven 
pressure of the carrying or conveying rollers in the processing 
machine. Therefor it is the main object of this invention to provide a 
photographic material that is free from roller marks, even at high  
 
speed processing cycles in automatic processors. Other objects will become apparent from the description 
hereinafter. It has been found that the said main object can be attained by a 
light-sensitive photographic silver halide material comprising a 
support and on one or both sides thereof at least one silver halide 
emulsion layer, characterised in that said silver halide emulsion 
layer(s) comprise(s) at least one synthetic clay. Natural clays are essentially hydrous aluminum silicates, 
wherein alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals are present as 
principal constituents. Also in some clay minerals magnesium or iron 
or both replace the aluminum wholly or in part. The ultimate 
chemical constituents of the clay minerals vary not only
