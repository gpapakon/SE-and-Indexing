<ABSTRACT>
Spacers or wedges are disclosed for use in combination with mold elements such as lens and/or reflex reflector pins in a pin block or matrix (10) assembly. Such assemblies are used in the manufacture of molds for producing, for example, front and/or rear light units for motor vehicles. The wedges (28, 30) or spacers are selectively located between rows or banks of reflex or optic pins (14) to provide required orientation to selected groups of the pins so that the necessary reflectivity of the finished product is provided in the curved portion thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mold matrix assemblies 
used in the manufacture of reflex reflector and lens 
units such as, for example, front and rear light 
units on automobiles. In particular, the invention is 
directed to spacing means for use in such matrix 
assemblies and the combination of the spacing means 
with mold elements in a matrix. A reflective mold matrix consists of a plurality 
of mold pins such as optic pins or reflex pins that 
are assembled into a specific configuration. The 
matrix is used to produce an electroform block, by 
electroplating, and this block is then used in the 
manufacture of a mold which receives thermoplastic 
mold material, under pressure, for making optic and 
reflective devices, for example automobile light 
assemblies. The reflective prisms in a light assembly 
are the result of reflector or reflex mold pins used 
to reflect light back to a source directed at the 
light assembly and the optic elements therein may be 
used, for example, as directional signalling running 
and stop lights. Some years ago, light assemblies on vehicles were 
generally flat, or located on flat areas of the 
vehicles, with reflective portions of the light 
assemblies often being incorporated in the bodywork of 
the vehicle. In many examples, the generally planar 
outer surfaces of the reflectors of the light  
 
assemblies were perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of 
the vehicle, or nearly so. However, in recent years, 
surfaces of vehicle bodies have been rounded off to 
provide more dramatic contours in an attempt to lower 
wind resistance and reduce surface friction and drag. According, aerodynamics is playing an increasing 
role in the design and overall configuration of motor 
vehicles and this has presented challenges in the 
manufacture of light assemblies, for example front and 
rear light assemblies, in that those products must not 
only conform to or blend with the contour of the vehicle 
bodywork but still provide the reflectivity and optical 
standards required by law. It is desirable therefore in the manufacture of a 
reflective mold matrix to find some way of orienting the 
mold elements so that the necessary reflectivity of the 
finished product is not lost in the curved portion 
thereof while matching the contour of the vehicle body. An example of one attempt of meeting the requirement 
is shown in U.S. Patent 4,733,946 of March 29, 1988 to 
Cossetti. In this patent, reflex pins are machined such 
that their side surfaces are tapered towards the face of 
the matrix so

<CLAIMS>
A mold element matrix assembly (10) for use in 
manufacturing a mold for producing a contoured lens or 

reflector unit, said assembly comprising a plurality of 
elongated pins or elements (14, 24, 26) with operative 

ends, and said elements being secured together in a block 
to provide a contoured matrix surface; characterised in 

that the mold element matrix assembly includes at least 
one wedge-shaped spacer (28, 30) in said assembly 

having a major end and a minor end, said spacer being 
located in said assembly with its minor end adjacent the 

matrix surface and between banks of said elements whereby 
the longitudinal axes of the pins or elements on one side 

of the spacer are disposed at an angle relative to the 
longitudinal axes of the pins or elements on the other 

side of the spacer. 
A matrix assembly according to Claim 1 wherein the 
minor end of said spacer (28) sits inwardly of the matrix 

face (Fig. 7). 
A matrix assembly according to Claim 1 or 2 
characterised in that said spacer (28) has a profile on 

one of its faces to complement the profile of juxtaposed 
pins or elements in said assembly. 
A mold element matrix assembly (10) according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the mold 

elements on either side of each spacer being rectangular 
in cross-section and an individual spacer (28), of the 

same width of said elements, being associated with a 
single mold element (114) on either side thereof. 
A mold element matrix assembly according to Claim 4 characterised in  
 

that the individual spacers aligned to each mold element 
are mechanically secured thereto (Fig. 11).
