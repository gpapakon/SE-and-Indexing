<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrography and, in particular, to electrographic imaging 
members and their preparation. The invention also relates to electrographic imaging methods. In electrography, an electrostatic latent image is formed on a dielectric imaging layer 
(electroreceptor) by various techniques such as by an ion stream (ionography), stylus, shaped 
electrode, and the like. Development of the electrostatic latent image may be effected by the 
application of certain electrostatically charged marking particles in either dry form or dispersed 
in liquid media. A hybrid composition or volume grafted elastomer comprising a fluoroelastomer and 
a polyorganosiloxane that forms an integral interpenetrating network has been disclosed in 
U.S.Patent No. 5,166,031. The volume graft composition was used in fabricating a thermal 
fusing member for use, for example, in fusing electrographic toner images. Fluoroelastomers, such as VITONÂ®, may be coated directly onto metallic substrates 
such as aluminum, steel or other suitable ground planes to form dielectric receivers. When 
these fluoroelastomer coated ground plane devices are corona charged by known means, the 
devices exhibit high charge injection rates which results in noncapacitive charging thereby 
causing high charge decay rates and low development potentials. These results render 
fluoroelastomer coated devices undesirable from a charging perspective. However, 
fluoroelastomers possess desirable mechanical properties, for example, durability, flexibility, 
solvent resistance, and the like, which make them particularly attractive for use in 
electroreceptor devices. The aforementioned high charge injection rates can be controlled and 
lowered by applying a blocking layer at an interface formed between the ground plane and 
the fluoroelastomer. However, the application of the blocking layer requires an additional 
coating step and additional drying and curing time which may reduce yields and unnecessarily 
inflates manufacturing costs. There continues to be a need for improved fluoroelastomers or hybrid compositions 
which embody both desired mechanical properties and low charge injection rate properties 
and which fluoroelastomers or hybrid compositions may be directly applied to a ground plane 
metallic substrate in a single step without requiring the application of an intermediate 
blocking layer at the interface between the ground plane and the dielectric fluoroelastomer 
layer in a separate step. There is a continuing need for electroreceptor
