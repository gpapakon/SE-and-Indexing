<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water-soluble
monoazo reactive dyes suitable for dyeing or printing
materials containing hydroxyl groups or amide groups,
such as cellulose fibers, natural or synthetic polyamide
fibers, polyurethane fibers or leathers, or fiber blends
thereof. More particularly, it relates to reactive dyes
capable of dyeing especially cellulose fibers in red
colors excellent in light fastness and levelness, their
compositions and a dyeing method employing them.Reactive dyes are widely used for dyeing various
materials, particularly cellulose fibers, as their colors
are clear, and they are excellent in various fastness
properties. On the other hand, in the industrial field
of dyeing, there is an increasing demand for better dyes.In recent years, a demand for reactive dyes of red
color type which are excellent in light fastness is
increasing more than ever. Conventional reactive dyes 
are usually at a level of grade 4, and no dyes as excellent as grade 5 have been
known, (after irradiation with carbon ark lamp light for 80 hours).
In order to meet the above-mentioned demand, the present inventors have
conducted extensive researches to develop a red reactive dye which is excellent
in light fastness, color fastness to light and perspiration and color fastness to
chlorine, particularly in light fastness. As a result, the present invention has been
accomplished.
The present invention provides a red reactive dye composition comprising at
least two dyes of the following formula (I) in its free acid form:

wherein X is -CH=CH2 or -C2H4W (wherein W is a group splittable by alkali), A
is a C2-3 alkylene group or a C2-3 alkylenoxy C2-3 alkylene group, E is a hydrogen
atom, a C1-3 alkyl group or -A-SO2X (wherein A and X are as defined above), n is
0 or 1, I is 1 or 2, m is 0 or 1, and R is a hydrogen atom, -OH, -CN, -CH3, -CF3,
-SO3H, -COOH, -CH2SO3H or -CH2SO2X (wherein X is as defined above).Dyestuffs of the formula (I) are already known and described, for example, in
DE-A-21 54 942 (see examples 1 and 20), FR-A-1 384 426 (see second formula
on left column) and CH-A-303 913. Now, the present invention will be described in
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.In the above formula (I), X is -CH=CH2 or -C2H4W,
wherein W is a group splittable by alkali. Under the
action of alkali, -C2H4W undergoes splitting so that it
will be converted to -CH=CH2 while splitting W-H off.As the group W to be split off under the action of
alkali, -OSO3H, -SSO3H, -OPO3H2, -OCOCH3 or a halogen atom
may
