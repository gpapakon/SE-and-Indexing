<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel substances, methods of
producing them and use of them. More particularly, it relates to novel
substances in which a polysaccharide is chemically bonded to silica gel
at its reducing terminal alone and in which part or all of the hydroxyl
groups in the polysaccharide moiety are substituted with a particular
substituent, as well as to methods of producing them and to a
separating agent for use in chromatography containing the same.It has hitherto been known that a substance consisting of silica
gel physically carrying a polysaccharide, such as cellulose, amylose or
a derivative thereof, is useful as a separating agent for separating
chiral compounds, in particular, as a separating agent for optical
resolution.However, due to its poor solvent resistance, the substance suffers
from the drawback that usable eluents are limited at the time when it is
to be used in liquid chromatography, or the like. In addition, it is
not possible to fully utilize the usefulness of the polysaccharide.
There is also a limitation in solvents usable for the washing of
contaminated columns, which can be a cause for the deterioration of
columns.In order to solve such problems, it has been proposed to use a
compound in which a polysaccharide is chemically bonded to silica gel. 
However, in this case, it is not possible to select the site at which
the chemical bonding to silica gel takes place. This exerts influences
on the higher structure of the polysaccharide per se and the usefulness
of the polysaccharide is diminished. In addition, there occurs still
another problem that the silica gel compound thus obtained shows a big
difference in quality since the bonding does not take place at a
specific site.Manssur Yalpani, Selective Chemical Modifications of Dextran, pages 1395 to 1405 in
Journal of Polymer Science, vol. 23, Number 5, May 1985 mentions the specific
modification of the reducing end group of dextran achieved by using the reductive
amination procedure and solvent systems designed to optimize polymer reactivity.
These end-group modifications afford chemically stable amine derivatives of known
composition and structure without attendant ring-cleavage and other polymer
degradation reactions.Thus, it is the object of the present invention to
overcome above disadvantages of the prior art. This object
has been achieved by the provision of a certain separating
agent of the structure wherein silica gel is used as a
porous carrier and polysaccharides are chemically bonded to the inner
and
