<ABSTRACT>
Stain resistance paints are disclosed which 
comprise styrene copolymers having a Tg of greater than 

21°C and less than 95°C, hiding pigment, and non-cellulosic 
thickener. These paints have improved 

stain-resistance compared to conventional paints.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stain-resistant
latex paint. In another aspect it relates to methods
of preparing said paint.Latex paints are generally emulsions of
polymer in water with dispersed pigment and other
additives. Latex paints are often preferred over
solvent-based paints because of their improved safety,
lower toxicity, and lower volatile-organic contents.
However, latex paints, particularly flat latex-paints,
generally have poor stain-resistance, that is, they
absorb stains such that the stains cannot be easily
removed by washing.Paints can be manufactured to have a final
film surface that is glossy, semi-glossy, or flat. The
smoother the paint surface is, the glossier or shinier
it appears. If the paint surface is made irregular,
reflected light becomes diffuse, and the paint does not
have a shiny appearance; such paints are said to
exhibit a degree of flatness.Flatting agents, such as silica, are often
used to cause the paint-film surface to be irregular.
For a discussion of the use of silica flatting agents
see, e.g., "Natural Silicas in Coatings," by Walter J.
Polestak and Thomas D. Thompson, Journal of Coatings
Technology, Volume 58, No. 735, April 1986, page 31-36
and "Amorphous Precipitated Silica Flatting Agents for
Coatings," by H. S. Ritter and H. J. Golden, Journal of
Coatings Technology, Volume 49, No. 628, May 1977, page
39-47.Flat latex paints generally stain badly, and
are difficult to clean because of their highly porous
nature, and because of their rough surface texture.
Surface dirt, such as handprints, smudges, dust and 
other particulate matter, may become entrapped in the
bumpy, rough texture of the paint surface. Penetrating
type stains, such as ink, soft drinks, wine, and other
colored liquids, have easy access into the interior of
a flat paint film through numerous pores and
microchannels.Certain acrylic emulsion polymers are useful
in alkali- or detergent-resistant inks or coatings.
See, for example, product bulletins PSN 0-100-10/82 and
PSN 0-602-9/86 of S.C. Johnson & Sons, Inc., for
Joncryl™ 537 acrylic emulsions.Acrylic emulsions are also disclosed in U.S.
Pat. No. 4,960,463 (Brown). Brown discloses floor-polishing
compositions comprising an alkoxylated amine
surfactant and a polymer. The polymer can be a
styrene-acrylic copolymer and the polymer may be
dispersed in water.U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,609 (Bunoway et al.)
discloses water-reducible compositions comprising a
polymer whose polymerized monomer units are obtained
from 64.5 to 84.5 wt % of monomers selected from a
