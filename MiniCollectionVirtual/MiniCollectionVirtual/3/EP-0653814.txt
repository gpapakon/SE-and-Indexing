<ABSTRACT>
A screened connecting device on the connecting plug (AS) which has a conductive strain relief device (ZV) has a sheet-metal flap (BL) which is integrally formed on the strain relief device (ZV). This sheet-metal flap (BL) is arranged such that it rests in a sprung manner on the broad side of the rectangular connecting plug (AS), on its plug part (AT) which projects into the housing (GH) of the connecting device.

<CLAIMS>
Screened connecting device, in which at least one
supply cable (VC), which is provided with a screen, is

connected internally to a conductive housing (GH) which
has at the front an opening (SO) for a connecting plug

(AS) which leads to a device and is provided with a
cuboid connecting part (AT), it being possible to insert

the connecting part (AT) into the opening (SO) and the
connecting plug (AS) having a conductive strain-relief

apparatus (ZV) for its connecting cable (AC), which
strain-relief apparatus is also used to hold the screen,

characterized in that the cuboid connecting part (AT) is
made of insulating material, in that a sheet-metal lug

(BL) is provided on the connecting plug (AS), is
integrally formed on the strain-relief apparatus (ZV) and

is arranged on the breadth side of the cuboid connecting
part (AT) such that it rests in a sprung manner on the

surface of the latter projecting into the housing (GH).
Screened connecting device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the sheet-metal lug (BL), which is

integrally formed on the strain-relief apparatus (ZV),
has a thickness of between 0.3 and 0.5 mm.
Screened connecting device according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the sheet-metal

lug (BL), which is integrally formed on the strain-relief
apparatus (ZV), is made of zinc-plated brass or

nickel-silver material.
Screened connecting device according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that, for an

angled plug, the sheet-metal lug (BL) is fitted on the 
strain-relief apparatus (ZV) in an angled form and rests

in a sprung manner on the connecting part (AT), which
likewise runs at right angles to the connecting plug

(AS).
Screened connecting device according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the strain

relief apparatus (ZV) extends essentially over the entire
width of the connecting plug (AS), as far as its side

walls.
Screened connecting device according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the sheet-metal

lug covers at least 50 % of the breadth side (BL)
of the connecting part (AT) projecting out of the connecting

plug (AS).
