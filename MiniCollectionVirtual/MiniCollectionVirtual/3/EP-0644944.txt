<ABSTRACT>
Described herein are constructions of recombinant DNA comprising modified adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA sequences capable of functioning as a eukaryotic expression vector for expressing foreign DNA sequences using a novel transcription promoter comprising the termini of AAV DNA. It is shown that expression of a test reporter gene can be obtained from this vector in mammalian cells. It is further shown that this combination of vector and promoter can be used to introduce and express a human gene and correct a genetic defect in human cells resulting from malfunction of the mutant endogenous gene. Further, the vector can be used to correct the genetic defect by expressing a modified version of the human gene consisting of a fusion of part of the said gene and a synthetic sequence contained in the vector.

<DESCRIPTION>
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) usually is defective for
replication and depends on co-existent adenovirus or herpesvirus
infection for efficient replication and a productive life cycle. In
the absence of helper virus, AAV can undergo stable integration of its
genome into the host cell but the integrated AAV genome has no
pathogenic effect. These properties formed the basis for the
development of AAV vectors for gene expression in mammalian cells.
AAV vectors have been used to express both selective markers (Hermonat
and Muzyczka, 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6466-6470; Tratschin
et al., 1985, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:3251-3260) such as neomycin
phosphotransferase (neo) and unselected genes including
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) (Tratschin et al., 1984, Mol.
Cell. Biol. 4:2072-2081) and thyroid stimulating hormone in eukaryotic
cells (Mendelson et al., 1988, Virology 166:154-165; Wondisford et
al., 1988, Molec. Endocrinol. 2:32-39).For use as a viral transducing vector AAV may present some
advantages including a high frequency of stable DNA integration and
the lack of pathogenicity of wild type AAV. One limitation of AAV is
that of size, since the packaging limit for foreign DNA in AAV
particles is approximately 4.5 kilobases. This limitation is an
important consideration for the design of AAV vectors for expression
of genes or cDNA constructs in which the gene coding sequence
approaches that of the AAV packaging limit, i.e., approximately 4.5
kilobases.One such gene, for example, is the cystic fibrosis gene
(CFTR). The airway epithelium is a critical site of cellular
dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal genetic
disease in North America, and is characterized by a defect in
regulation of Cl- conductance (Hwang et al., 1989, Science 244:1351-1353;
Li, et al., 1988, Nature (London) 331:358-360, Li et al., 1989, 
Science 244:1353-1356; Schoumacher et al., 1987, Nature (London)
330:752-754). The cDNA for the CFTR gene (Riordan et al., 1989,
Science 245:1066-1073; Rommens et al., 1989, Science 245:1059-1065)
has been expressed in eukaryotic cells. Expression of the CFTR
protein in non-epithelial cell lines resulted in generation of a Cl-
conductance (Andersen et al., 1991, Science 251:679-682; Kartner et
al., 1991, Cell 64:681-691). The CF defect has been complemented by
expression of CFTR in a CF pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line by
stable transduction with a retrovirus vector (Drumm et al., 1990, Cell
62: 1227-1233), and in a CF airway cell line by infection with a
vaccinia
