<ABSTRACT>
A method for modifying a phase change ink jet head 
by applying a non-wetting material to the discharge 

surface is provided such that an ink contact angle 
between about 80째 and about 90째 is maintained on the 

discharge surface after continued exposure to molten 
phase change inks. Furthermore, the method provided 

ensures that the layer of non-wetting coating material 
does not chip or wear off during the normal operation of 

the ink jet printer. In this way, the ink jet printer is 
capable of accurate placement of phase change ink drops 

without increased surface wetting and off-axis shooting 
that traditionally occurs after continued use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink jet print heads and
more specifically to a method for modifying ink jet print
heads to prevent degradation of ink contact angles after
continued exposure to molten phase change inks.Ink jet printers having one or more ink jet print
heads with one or more ink jetting nozzles in each
printhead for projecting drops of ink to generate graphic
images and text have become increasingly popular. To
form color images, ink jet printers with multiple ink
jetting nozzles are used, with each nozzle being supplied
with ink of a different color. These colored inks are
then applied, either alone or in a combination, to the
printing medium to make a finished color print.
Typically, all of the colors needed to make the print are
produced from combinations of cyan, magenta, and yellow
inks. Black ink may also be added to the above ink
combination when the combination of the cyan, magenta and
yellow does not produce a true enough black, or when text
is being printed.Various systems and methods are known for producing
printed images with aqueous based inks. A serious
problem in printing images with ink jets that use aqueous
based inks is wetting of the ink discharge surface.
Wetting of the discharge surface is caused by a low ink
contact angle, and typically ink contact angles of
greater than 90째 are sought. The ink contact angle is
the angle formed by the tangent to the ink drop at the
ink discharge surface and the ink discharge surface. The
ink contact angle is created by a difference in surface
energies between the ink composition and the material 
defining the discharge surface. The larger the ink
contact angle, the less wetting of the discharge surface
that occurs.The presence of ink deposits due to surface wetting
on the ink discharge surface surrounding the drop
discharge nozzle causes several problems. The most
severe problem is that the wetted surface eventually
degrades the ink contact angle between the ejecting ink
droplet and the discharge surface such that no ink is
discharged at all. This becomes a more prevalent problem
as the rate of ink ejection is increased. Another
problem caused by wetting of the discharge surface is
that the ink deposits cause non-uniform ink ejection or
off-axis shooting. Non-uniform ink ejection causes poor
quality of the printed image. Still another problem
caused by wetting of the discharge surface is that a
color ink jet print head may have nozzles of different
colors adjacent to each other. As the discharge surface
wets, the colors mix and the ink

A method for decreasing wetting by a phase change ink
composition of a discharge surface of an ink jet head (10), the method

comprising the steps of exposing the ink jet head (10) to a hydrogen
environment; applying a layer (50) of a non-wetting coating material to

an area on the discharge surface (18) surrounding a nozzle (20) thereof
while the discharge surface is still reactive with the non-wetting

coating material due to exposure to the hydrogen environment; and
curing the material of the coated surrounding area at a temperature

which promotes decomposition of the coating material for increasing
adherence of the coating material to the surrounding area, and for

eliminating the coating material in the ink jet nozzle (20).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the step of exposing the
ink jet head (10) to the hydrogen environment occurs during a bonding

process of a plurality of components of the ink jet head (10).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the step of
applying the coating material occurs less than one hour from the step

of exposing the ink jet head (10) to the hydrogen environment.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising the step
of applying an adhesion promoting layer on the discharge surface.
A method as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the material of the
adhesion promoting layer comprises a polyimide and/or a

polyetherketone.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the step of
applying the layer (50) of coating material is performed with a

meniscus coating system such that the resultant layer of the coating 
material is substantially smooth or uniform to allow the ink composition

to be removed from the discharge surface (18) during a cleaning
process.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the step of
applying the layer (50) of coating material includes maintaining an ink

jet head (10) gas pressure such that the coating material does not
substantially travel into an ink jet nozzle (20), but wherein said gas

pressure is not great enough to allow the gas to pass through the
coating material.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the step of
applying the layer of coating material includes applying a second ink jet

head (10) gas pressure after application of the coating material such
that coating material disposed in an ink jet head nozzle (20) is blown

out thereof by the gas.
A method as claimed in Claim 8 wherein the step of applying a
second ink jet head (10) gas pressure leaves therein a layer (50) of

coating material that is thin enough with respect to the layer (50) of
coating material on the discharge surface (18) to be completely

decomposed during the curing step while the layer of coating material
on the discharge surface (18) remains.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the surface
energy of the layer (50) of coating material is low enough to maintain

an ink contact angle greater than 70째 between the phase change ink
composition and the discharge surface (18).
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the coating
material comprises a fluorinated polymeric material. 
A method as claimed in Claim 11 wherein the fluorinated
polymeric material is an amorphous perfluorodioxole copolymer.
