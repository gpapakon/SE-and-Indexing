<DESCRIPTION>
Fungicidally active compoundsFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to fungicidally active compounds and methods for their preparation as well as microorganisms capable of producing such compounds. Furthermore, the invention relates to fungicidal compositions comprising these compounds, either alone or in combination with other biocides or growth regulators, and to the use of the compounds or compositions of the invention for controlling fungi.The compounds of the invention belong to a sub-group of the well-known tetronic acids having the general formula 1 as shown below, namely the 4-ylidene tetronic acids with the general formula 2.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is well known that various microorganisms are capable of producing metabolites associated with interesting biological activities. Such compounds are of potential interest for use in, e.g. the agricultural field where they are considered to constitute environmentally desirable alternatives to syntheti- cally prepared compounds normally used, e.g. as biocides for controlling diseases and pests in valuable crops.Although the search for such microbial metabolites has been a growing area of research during the last decade, only a minor number of useful biologically active metabolites has been identified and most biocides employed today are still syntheti¬ cal compounds.4-Ylidene tetronic acids with the general formula 2, is a rather newly discovered group of natural products. The dis¬ tribution, synthesis, biosynthesis and biological activities of these compounds has been reviewed by Pattenden1. 
Formula 2These compounds are a sub-group of the tetronic acids with the general formula 1, which include biologically important natural products, such as vitamin C (i.e. a compound of formula 1 wherein R!=OH and R2=CHOHCH2OH) .Formula 1A variety of different biological activities have been reported for the tetronic acids, including antibiotic, anti-inflammato¬ ry, plant growth inhibitory, immunosuppressive and anti- coagulant effects1-23 . However, the application of the compounds in therapy has often been precluded due to undesirable toxic side-effects. 

The genus Fusiccocum is known as a producer of secondary metabolites; diterpenes4 and fatty acid derivatives5'6 have been reported from F. a ygdali , but no compounds having structure and biological activity spectrum similar to the tetronic acids has been reported from said genus.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt was therefore surprising to find that the fungal species Fuεiccocum is capable of
