<DESCRIPTION>
-(4-FLU0R0PHENYLWETHYL)-PIPERIDINES HAVING SIGMA AND D2-RECEPT0R AFFINITYThe present invention relates to new 1,4-disubstituted piperidine derivatives having the general formula (I) :(I)wherein X is hydroxymethylene or methoxymethylene, Y is a 3- membered methylene sequence and R is a p-fluorophenyl group, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.The compounds of the present invention are obtained according to Scheme I. In effect, the al ylation of 4- (p-fluorobenzoyl) 0 piperidine with the halogen derivative Cl-Y-O-R, wherein Y and R are as previously defined, in the presence of an alkali and a non polar solvent, leads to 4- (p-fluorobenzoyl) -1- (3-p- fluorophenoxy)propylpiperidine (II). Subsequent reduction of this intermediate with sodium borohydride yields the final compound of formula (I, X: CHOH, Y: (CH2)3, R: p-F-C6H4) . In contrast, the compound of formula (I, X: CH(OCH3), Y: (CH2)3, R: p-F-C6H4) requires first the protection of 4- (p-fluoro¬ benzoyl)piperidine. For this purpose, this compound is conveniently reacted with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in an organic basic medium. N-tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative (III) 

 Scheme 1(I, X: CH(OCH3), Y: (CH2)3, R: p-F-C5H4)Abbreviations: t-Bu-O-CO-O-CO-O-t-Bu: O/'-fwr-butyl dicarbonateEt,N: TriethylaminβEtOH: EthanolTHF: Tetrahydrofuran 

 is then formed, which enables to be handled safe from dialkylation in subsequent synthesis steps. The reduction of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative with sodium borohydride in ethanol provides the corresponding secondary alcohol (IV) . Its methylation with iodomethane in the presence of a strong base in an ether-like solvent leads to the methoxy-derivative (V) . The strong base and the choice ether-like solvent are sodium hydride and tetrahydrofuran respectively. The following step is the unprotected reaction of (V) in acid medium. This reaction occurs conveniently by dissolving hydrogen chloride in a mixture of water and ethanol. The piperidinyl-derivative (VI) is then susceptible to be alkylated under analogous conditions to those employed for the obtention of (II) . Thus, the final compound of the formula (I, X: CH(OH3), Y: (CH2)3, R: p-F-C6H4) is obtained.US Patent No. 4588728 describes the treatment of psychosis with cis-9- [3- (3,5-dimethyl-piperazinyl) ropyl]carbazole. US Patent No. 4709094 describes the preparation of 1,3- disubstituted guanidines as well as their utility in the diagnosis and treatment of hallucinations associated with psychotic disorders and chronic mental depression.
