<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adaptable dipole-type radiating element consisting of a substrate plate (1), of a feeder line (2) situated on the lower face of the said substrate plate (1), and of a metal deposition (3) situated on the upper face of the said substrate plate (1) and substantially T-shaped: the horizontal bar of the said T consisting of two lateral strands (5, 6) separated by a coupling slot (7), and the vertical bar (11) of the said T constituting an earth plane for the said feed line (2), the said lateral strands (5, 6) constituting the radiating part of the said radiating element. According to the invention, the said feed line (2) has a first end portion (9) extending along an axis intercepting the axis of the said coupling slot (7) and extending from the said axis of the coupling slot by a first variable length (l1), the said slot (7) has a second end portion (10) extending from the axis of the said first end portion (9) of the feed line by a second variable length (l2), and the radiating element comprises first and/or second variable-capacitance means, the said first variable-capacitance means being connected between an earth plane (6) and the end of the said feed line (3) situated in the said first end portion (9), the said second variable-capacitance means being connected between an earth plane and the end of the said slot situated in the said second end portion.

Adaptable radiating element, of the dipole type
consisting of:


a substrate plate (1);
a feed line (2) situated on the lower face of the
said substrate plate (1);
a metallic deposition (3) situated on the upper
face of the said substrate plate (1) and substantially

in the shape of a T: the horizontal
bar of the said T consisting of two lateral spans

(5, 6) separated by a coupling slot (7), and the
vertical bar (11) of the said T constituting an

earth plane for the said feed line (2), the said
lateral spans (5, 6) constituting the radiating

part of the said radiating element,

extending along an axis which intercepts the axis of the

said coupling slot (7) and protrudes from the said axis
of the coupling slot by a first variable length (11),

   and the said slot (7) exhibiting a second end
portion (10) protruding from the axis of the said first

end portion (9) of the feed line by a second variable
length (12); characterized

in that it comprises first (31) and/or second variable-capacitance
means, the said first variable-capacitance

means (31) being connected between an earth plane (6) and
the end (32) of the said feed line (3) situated in the

said first end portion (9), the said second variable-capacitance
means being connected between an earth plane

and the end of the said slot situated in the said second 
end portion.
Radiating element according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the said slot (7) is of rectangular

shape.
Radiating element according to either one of
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the aggregate

length of the said two lateral spans (5, 6) together is
substantially equal to half the wavelength of operation

of the said radiating element.
Radiating element according to any one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the said two lateral spans

(5, 6) are of the same length.
Radiating element according to any one of Claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the said feed line (3) is
