<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for setting a 
spline having damaged vertebras, comprising an anchoring 

element including a shaft portion (16) to be attached to 
spaced vertebras, the free end of said anchoring element 

including a slot (24) for receiving a distracting or, 
respectively, compressing bar (40), and a cap nut (42) to 

be screwed onto an outer thread (32) provided in the region 
of the receiving slot to urge an axial fixing portion (44) 

towards the bar received in said receiving slot. The invention 
is defined in that the receiving slot (24) is formed 

in a separate swiwel head (20) including an inner end in 
the shape of a ball receiving portion (24) which has an 

aperture (28) through which said shaft portion (16;52) of 
the anchoring element (10;50) extends, wherein the diameter 

of the shaft portion adjacent said aperture is smaller than 
that of said aperture (28), and that a ball head (14;56) is 

provided at the end of the shaft portion (16;52), said ball 
head having a diameter larger than that of said aperture 

(28) and said ball head (14;56) in the ball receiving portion 
(24) entering the terminal region of said receiving 

slot (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for setting
damaged vertebras in a spline according to the preamble of
claim 1.It is known to stabilize a spline having damaged vertebras
by implanting a stabilizing system in the vertebras on
either side of a damaged vertebra. For this, the spline is
first set and then stabilized. It is further generally
known to turn so-called pedicel screws into the pedicels of
vertebras and to connect the pedicels screws to each other
through a more or less rigid connecting system. For
example, this can be obtained by using a so-called distracting
or compressing bar which is inserted in a receiving
slot provided in the heads of the pedicel screws. The bar
is usually provided with a thread, a grooving or some other
surface roughness such that it can be fixed in the head of
the pedicel screws by means of an appropriate locking
means. EP 0 348 272 discloses a pedicel screw having a
receiving slot which is provided with a thread to receive a
locking screw. The locking screw fixes the distracting or
compressing bar in the slot. U.S. patent 4,763,644 discloses
a pedicel screw which head is provided with an outer
thread onto which a cap shaped nut can be screwed. By means
of a pin portion inserted into the receiving slot, the cap
nut urges the bar against the bottom of the receiving slot.
French patent 26 24 270 discloses a cap nut including a
locking screw to fix the distracting or compressing bar in
the receiving slot. Cap nuts have the advantage of holding
together the legs of the slotted pedicel screw head. As 
mentioned above, there is the danger that the legs spread apart, thus loosening the locking
screw when a solid screw is screwed into the receiving slot. Furthermore, fixing of the
distracting bar is endangered. In the process of the operation, the pedicel screws are first
secured. The position of the pedicel screws or, respectively, the heads thereof is optional to
some extent, in particular, when the vertebras are more or less displaced. According to the
prior art it is required to prebend the distracting or compressing bar to be received in the
receiving slots of the pedicel screws. Since the distracting and compressing bars must be stiff
by nature, the process described requires the surgeon to apply substantial efforts, and after all
the process is complicate.From WO91/16020 it has become known to provide a pedicel screw with a spherical head.
The spherical head is accommodated by a swivel head having a spherical receiving portion
and a receiving slot for receiving a

A device for setting a spline having damaged vertebraes comprising an anchoring
element including a shaft portion (16, 52) to be attached to spaced vertebraes, a free

end of said anchoring element (10, 50) being formed by a ball (14, 56), a separate
swivel head (20) including an inner end in the shape of a ball receiving portion (24)

which has an aperture (28) through which said shaft portion (16, 52) of said anchoring
element (10, 50) extends, wherein the diameter of said shaft portion (16, 52) adjacent

said aperture (28) is smaller than that of said aperture (28), said swivel head (20)
including a slot (38) opened to the end of said swivel head (20) opposite to said aperture

(28) for receiving a distracting or, respectively, compressing bar (40), said ball head
(14) having a diameter larger than that of said aperture (28), and a nut (42) to be

screwed onto an outer thread (32) provided at said swivel head (20) in the area of said
receiving slot (38) to urge an axial fixing portion (44) towards the bar (40) received in

said receiving slot (38), characterized in that said ball head (14, 56) has a diameter
which is larger than the distance between said ball receiving portion (24) and the end

(26) of said receiving slot (38), thus entering the terminal region at the
end (26) of said receiving slot (38). 
The device of claim 1, wherein said ball head (14, 56) is formed integral with said
shaft portion (16, 52).
The device of claim 1 or 2, wherein said ball receiving portion (24) of said swivel
head (20) includes a spherical surface.
The device of one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein said nut (42) is a cap nut and said
axial fixing portion (44) is formed integral with said cap nut.
The device of claim 4, wherein said axial fixing portion (42) has a rounded free end
(46).
The device of one of the claims 1 to 5, wherein the terminal portion of said swivel
head (20) facing said shaft portion (16, 52) of said anchoring element (10, 50) is ball-shaped.
The device of claim 6, wherein the ball-shaped portion of said swivel head (20) enters
into a conical portion (34) tapering towards said aperture (28), said conical portion
