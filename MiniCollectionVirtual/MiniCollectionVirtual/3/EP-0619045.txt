 DescriptionSEALANT FOR POROUS FUEL CELL COMPONENT FRAMES USING POLYMERIZATION OF MONOMERSTechnical Field The present invention relates to an edge sealant, and especially to an edge sealant for a porous plate using polymerization of monomers.Background ArtThe production of electricity is often the function of various types of fuel cells arranged in fuel cell stacks. The fuel cells are comprised of components including a cathode and an anode with an electrolyte disposed therebetween, a cathode chamber and an anode chamber. Actual electricity production is accomplished via a reaction between a fuel and an oxidant which causes free electrons to flow through an external load. Hydrogen and oxygen are introduced to the anode and cathode of a fuel cell, respectively, by separate and distinct passageways. At the anode, hydrogen is ionized to hydrogen ions and free electrons. The free electrons pass through an external load to the cathode, thereby producing electricity, while the hydrogen ions migrate through an electrolyte to the cathode. At the cathode, the hydrogen ions and free electrons react with oxygen to form water.The water produced at the cathode can be removed from the cathode with porous plates which serve a dual function in the fuel cell. These porous plates act as cathode chambers by directing the oxidant to the 

 cathode, and also act as a water removal system by removing water from the cathode (disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,769,297 and U.S. Patent No. 5,064,732). Essentially, a pressure differential is maintained across the porous plate, thereby causing the water produced at the cathode to pass through the porous plate. The pore size in the porous plate works in combination with the pressure differential such that when water builds up at the cathode, the pressure differential across the porous plate goes to zero and the water is discharged through the porous plate. The pressure differential is known as the bubble pressure and is generally between about l and about 5 pounds per square inch (psi) . The area through which the water passes is known as the active area of the porous plate.Since mixing of the fuel and oxidant can cause direct combustion or an explosion, it is necessary to prevent the leakage of fuel and oxidant through the porous plate. Oxidant flow through the porous plate is prevented by the water which occupies the pores in the active area. However, there is a leakage problem experienced on the edge of the porous plate. The edge of the porous plate corresponds to that area from the
