<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to low-gloss compositions for high reflectance films 
in the infra-red range. Te low-gloss compositions comprise a binder, a quasi-transparent 

filler particles having a size below 110 µ, possessing low emissivity in 
the thermal infra-red wavelengths in the range of 3-5µ and 8-12µ, consisting of 

thin layers which contain between 0.1 % to 10 % by weight of the composition of a 
polyolefin. These compositions are charaterized by an index of refraction of 

polyolefin-air of at least 10% greater than that of the binder-air. Prefferd 
compounds for thin layers consist of at least two oxides selected from chromium 

oxides, nickel oxides, iron oxides, manganese oxides and cobalt oxides. The 
preferred amount of the filler is in the range of between 0.3% to 5% by weight of 

the composition and comprises particles of a substantial round or elipsoid shapes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to low-gloss compositions for high reflectance films 
in the infra-red range. More particularly the invention relates to low-gloss 
compositions for various dispersions, such as paints or multi layer of oxides 
possessing a low emissivity in the thermal infra-red range. Paints are known to comprise suspension of one or more colouring constituents in 
a liquid-forming binder capable of converting to a solid film when a thin layer of 
it is applied to a metal, wood, stone, paper, or other surface and produces a 
continuous coloured film. The surface becomes coloured because it absorbs light 
of certain wavelengths. Many film-forming materials are used both as clear 
coatings and as pigment/binders mixtures. In case of solution vehicles, the binder 
is dissolved in a solvent to form a clear, viscous solution, and the pigment or the 
oxide is dispersed directly into the vehicle solution. On film formation the 
solidified vehicle serves to bind the pigment, forming a continuous film phase. 
Vehicles belonging to this category include drying oils, varnishes, synthetic resins 
and high polymeric materials such as the cellulosic and vinyl polymers. In another type of vehicle the resins are dispersed in a liquid. Dispersion resins are 
in the form of tiny, spherical, insoluble particles suspended in a volatile liquid such 
as water or any volatile solvent. When the liquid evaporates, discrete particles of 
pigment, oxide or resin remain as a continuous film. Examples of dispersion 
coatings include the polyvinyl chloride organosols and synthetic rubber latexes. 
Modern paints are "tailor-made" coatings which are usually designed by skilled 
scientists for specific purposes. Thus, there are known various types of paints, such 
as paints against corrosion, insulating paints which withstand at high temperatures, and 
paints for electric conductance. An important constituent in the paint 
dispersion is the binder which imparts the film forming properties. Some of the 
constituents possess different optical functions and are selected according to their 
spectral properties. 
Almost all the paints on the market, comprise pigments and fillers which should 
fulfill the optical requirements at visible light, i.e. an electromagnetic radiation 
with a wavelength in the range of 0.4-0.7 micrometers. 
The three main constituents of the paints are:  
 
(a) Pigments having the function to give the paint the opacity, colour and added 
durability, by protecting the oil and resin film from
