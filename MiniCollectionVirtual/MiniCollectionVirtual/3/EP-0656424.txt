<ABSTRACT>
An improved assay to determine sensitivity to activated protein C in assay samples has been developed in order to ensure rapid and accurate analyses. This assay is based on measurement of the conversion of added factor X into an activated form by activated factor VIII within an assay sample. The sensitivity of the assay sample to activated protein C is determined from the relative inhibition of the factor X conversion by comparison with a control. An assay sample with reduced sensitivity to activated protein C shows a relatively low inhibition and vice versa.

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining the sensitivity relative to activated
protein C in a test sample, comprising the steps of


(a) reacting factor X, activated factor IX, activated protein C
and thrombin with the test sample in a test solution containing

calcium ions and phospholipids, the test sample constituting 10%
V/V of the test solution
 at the most,
(b) determining the amount of activated factor X formed in the
reaction of step (a),
(c) calculating the sensitivity of the test sample relative to
activated protein C on the basis of the determination of step

(b), as compared to a control.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the control comprises
a control solution prepared by reacting the test sample with factor

X, activated factor IX and thrombin in the presence of calcium
ions and phospholipids without the addition of activated

protein C, and the determination of the amount of activated factor
X formed thereby.
A method according to one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the factor
Ixa is factor IXaβ.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
determination step is carried out by the addition of a chromogenic

substrate.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
concentration of factor X is 0.01-10 U/ml, and the concentration

of activated protein C is 0.05-5 U/ml.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
concentration of factor IXa is 0.05-5 U/ml, and the concentration

of thrombin is 0.01 to 2.0 U/ml.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the
concentration of the phospholipids is 0.01-100 nmol/ml, and the

concentration of the calcium ions is 1-50 µmol/ml. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
test sample is less than 2% V/V of the test solution.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the
test sample is 0.8-1.6% V/V of the test solution.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised
in that
 a test solution is used which additionally contains
protein S.
A method according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 a
test solution is used which contains free protein S.
A method according to claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that

a test solution is used which is derived from a patient who has
been treated with oral anticoagulants.
A method according to any one of claims 10 to 12, 
characterised
in that
 the concentration of protein S is selected corresponding
to a ratio of 1 to 10 units, preferably 3 to 5 units,

per ml of undiluted test sample.
