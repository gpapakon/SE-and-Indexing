<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent core for use in an absorbent product suitable 
for placement in a wearer's garment, and absorbent products 

utilizing the core, are disclosed. The core comprises an 
absorbent batt folded upon itself along a pair of generally 

parallel longitudinal fold lines (15, 16) to form a middle, 
body-facing panel (12) and two side panels (11, 13), which 

three panels are substantially equivalent in width at the 
central transverse axis (24) of the batt (10). In various 

preferred embodiments, one or more of the panels are 
embossed with patterns that serve to direct fluid transport 

in the product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an absorbent product for use
in a wearer's garment and to an absorbent core for use in an
absorbent product suitable for placement in a wearer's garment
in accordance with the preamble of claims 1, 11 and 12. The
preamble of said claim is based on EP-A-0 376 761.EP 0 376 761 is related to an article for feminine
hygiene comprising absorbent material consisting of fluff
being impregnated with a mixture formed from a bacteriostatic
and fungistatic agent and a deodorant in a non-volatile hydrophilic
solvent adhering to the cellulosic fibers.US-A-4 576 596 discloses a sanitary napkin having an
absorbent layer folded back along itself to form a top layer
and bottom folded layer which abut each other near the central
portion of the napkin. A thin extra-absorbent layer is
positioned within the fold and the folding end position of the
absorbent layer. A further fold is provided by an additional
layer. The known napkin can have four absorbent layers and a
raised center area. A further embodiment of this known napkin
provides an open central area with a single fold with a folded
portion being positioned on the upper portion of the napkin.Despite the many advances that have been made in the
design of absorbent products such as diapers, incontinent
products and sanitary napkins, there is a constant need for
improved products that will offer the user greater security.
Ways to enhance the absorbent capacity of such products have
been found and widely utilized, for example, the inclusion of
superabsorbent materials in product design. However, despite
increased absorbent capacity, tests show that a surprisingly
high proportion of such products still fail, i.e., the wearer
experiences leakage and staining. In large part, such failure
is due to the stress imposed upon the product during use. A
sanitary napkin, for example, is subjected to significant
distortional forces by the wearer's body movements. These
forces can tend to compress the napkin laterally, causing it 
to rope or twist and thereby present a smaller area for fluid
pick-up. Although this problem has been addressed in the art,
there remains a need for new product designs that will
successfully alleviate such distortion problems but that are
also easily manufactured so that cost-effective products can
be offered to consumers.A number of patents have published disclosing sanitary
napkins having an absorbent batt folded in a particular configuration.U.K. Patent Application GB 2,124,499A discloses a
