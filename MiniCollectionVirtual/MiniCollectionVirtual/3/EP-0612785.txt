<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to branched 
silicones having a T or Q siloxy unit in the polymer 
structure and which are modified with an epoxy group. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to the 
use of the branched silicones as a copolymerizate with 
other thermoplastic resins. Epoxy resins have many desirable properties 
which make them attractive as coatings, adhesives, paper 
release agents, additives for printing inks and for other 
applications. Included among these desirable properties 
are low viscosity, excellent clarity, high gloss and high 
reactivity. Epoxy-modified silicone resins based on linear 
siloxy groups have also been prepared having improved 
heat-resistance, anti-corrosion resistance and water-resistance 
over the epoxy resins. Mikami, United States Patent No. 4,283,513, 
discloses siloxane-modified epoxy resin compositions 
comprising siloxane-modified epoxy resins, alkoxy 
functional organopolysiloxanes, and curing agents which 
have improved resistance to degradation of electrical 
properties by boiling water and moisture. Mikami, United States Patent No. 4,287,326, 
describes siloxane-modified epoxy resin compositions 
consisting essentially of siloxane modified epoxy resins, 
organofunctional alkoxysilicone compounds and curing 
agents which have improved degradation resistance to both 
electrical and adhesion properties when exposed to 
moisture or boiling water.  Liles et al., United States Patent No. 
4,082,719, disclose silicone epoxy curable compositions 
which teach the admixing of a small amount of an 
organosilicone compound containing at least one silicon-bonded 
hydrogen atom with curable compositions comprising 
a hydroxy-containing organosilicone compound, an epoxy 
compound and an aluminum compound to improve the curing 
performance of the compositions. Crivello et al., United States Patent No. 
5,037,861, disclose cyclic epoxy functional siloxanes of 
the formula ((R'R'')SiO)n which has low initial viscosity 
yet are highly reactive in cationic photo-initiated 
polymerization reactions. Hoffman et al., United States Patent No. 
4,707,529, disclose a dispersion of a siloxane polymer 
and optional dispersion stabilizer in an epoxy compound 
as a continuous phase, wherein the siloxane polymer is 
grafted to the epoxide compound. The patentees teach 
that the siloxane polymers which have functional groups 
capable of forming a graft with the epoxy compound 
continuous phase can include T-structure polydimethylsiloxanes 
having vinyl functionality(ies)
