<ABSTRACT>
The installation for continuous casting of a thin metal strip (1) incorporates a circulating cooled conveyor belt (2) and a distributor (5) from which melt (7) is delivered onto the belt. The delivery of melt onto the belt, from an essentially tangential distributor board (8), occurs at a point on the conveyor drum (3) located within an angle range from 5 to 20 deg measured from the highest point (the 12 o'clock position) on the drum which is cooled at least over this range. The angle range for the delivery point varies from 5 to 10 deg. The distributor board (8) is inclined at an angle from 1 to 3 deg to the transport plane (E). The thickness of delivery edge (9) of this board varies from 1 to 5 mm. The distributor (5) is provided with integrated side elements limiting the width of metal delivery, and with a movable smoothing element (13).

Casting apparatus for continuous production of a thin 
metal strip (1), with a circulating cooled conveyor belt (2) 

which is guided by return rollers (3, 4), and with a melt 
distributor (5) which can be placed on the conveyor belt (2) 

and from which metal melt (7) is put onto the conveyor belt 
(2) and hardened, characterised in that the melt distributor 

(5) opens with a substantially tangential inlet of the 
distributor base (8) at a centre-point angle α in the range 

from 5 to 20° before the vertex at the 12 o'clock position of 
the front return roller (3) as viewed in the direction of 

travel of the conveyor belt (2), and that the front return 
roller (3) is cooled at least in the region which is swept by 

the particular centre-point angle α. 
Casting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the range for the centre-point angle α is 5 to 10°. 
Casting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the distributor base (8) is inclined at 

an angle β = 1 to 3° with respect to the plane (E) of the 
conveyor belt. 
Casting apparatus as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the thickness of the pouring edge 

(9) of the distributor base (8) is D = 1 to 5 mm. 
Casting apparatus as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that lateral limits (10) are integrated 

into the melt distributor (5). 
Casting apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, characterised 
in that the underside of the distributor base (8) rests on the 

conveyor belt (2) in the region of the lateral limits (10).  
 
Casting apparatus as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the melt distributor (5) is 

arranged depending upon the furnace. 
Casting apparatus as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the melt distributor (5) is 

arranged independently of the furnace. 
Casting apparatus as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that a smoothing strip (13) which is 

movable in the conveyor belt plane E or perpendicular thereto 
is associated with the melt distributor (5).
