<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an abrasive 
article (10) for abrading material from a workpiece (26). 

In one embodiment, the abrasive article includes a back-up 
pad having first (14) and second (16) major surfaces. The 

first major surface includes a shaft (17) adapted to 
connect the abrasive article to an abrading apparatus (18) 

for movement relative thereto. Adjoining the second major 
surface are first and second resilient support portions 

(20, 22), to which are attached first and second abrading 
members (24, 28), respectively. When an operator applies a 

first force to the abrading apparatus, the first abrasive 
surface contacts and abrades the workpiece. When the 

operator applies a second force that is greater than the 
first force, both the first and the second abrasive 

surfaces contact and abrade the workpiece.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an abrasive article 
for removing material from a workpiece. Abrasives are commonly used in a wide variety of 
fields for abrading material from a workpiece. The 
workpiece may be made of a material such as wood, plastic, 
metal, or glass, and typically may have an excess of such 
material or an undesirable surface finish, or both. In 
either case, or for other similar applications, an 
abrasive article is typically used to abrade the surface 
of the workpiece until the excess material has been 
removed or the surface finish has been refined, or both. 
Two popular types of abrasives are nonwoven abrasives and 
coated abrasives, and either may be provided with a range 
of surface characteristics to abrade a workpiece in a 
desired manner. For a typical abrading process, a variety of 
abrasive articles may be used to provide a progressively 
finer finish. These abrasive articles are typically used 
in series, wherein the abrasive articles used initially 
remove deep scratches and excess material, and later 
abrasive members refine and finish the surface as desired. 
For example, a cast or molded part may have an excess of 
material in one or more locations as well as a relatively 
rough surface finish. A worker may first use a coarse 
abrasive to remove most of the excess material and to 
abrade away any deep scratches in the surface finish. The 
worker may then change tools, and use a finer grade 
abrasive to remove more of the excess material and to 
refine the surface further. Finally the worker may use a 
still finer grade abrasive member to remove minor 
imperfections and scratches from the surface of the 
workpiece. This method is known as the "grade sequence"  
 
method of abrading, and is widely used for a variety of 
applications. Abrading, as that term is used herein, includes 
not only sanding, grinding, and macroscopic surface 
refinishing, but also buffing, polishing, and other types 
of microscopic surface finishing and refinement as well. 
Buffing, as that term is used herein, is the process used 
to remove small scratches left by the fine grade abrasive 
used in the final sanding step. Polishing, as that term is 
used herein, is the process used to remove any swirl marks 
left by the buffing member. Both buffing and polishing 
typically require the addition of certain compounds to 
enhance and refine the surface finish. Hence a worker may 
use one or more abrasive articles sequentially to grind 
away excess material in the manner described above, and 
may use one

<CLAIMS>
An abrasive article (10) for abrading 
material from a workpiece (26), comprising a back-up pad 

(12) having at least one abrading surface comprising means 
for abrading the workpiece, wherein a first generally 

planar portion (24) of the at least one abrading surface 
contacts the workpiece in response to a first force 

applied to the abrasive article, and first and second 
generally planar portions (28) of the at least one 

abrading surface contact the workpiece in response to a 
second force applied to the abrasive article, wherein the 

second force is greater than the first force. 
The abrasive article of claim 1, wherein the 
abrasive means disposed on the first abrading surface is 

adapted to produce a fine surface finish, and the abrasive 
means disposed on the second abrading surface is adapted 

to produce a coarse surface finish. 
The abrasive-article of claim 2, wherein the 
abrasive means disposed on the first abrading surface is 

adapted for polishing the surface, and the abrasive means 
disposed on the second abrading surface is adapted for 

buffing the surface.
