<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a block copolymer
composition, to a hot melt adhesive composition comprising this
block copolymer composition and to a process for preparing such
block copolymer composition.European Patent Application No. 0,479,754 discloses a process
for decolourizing vinyl aromatic-conjugated diene copolymers which
are obtained by anionic polymerization using an alkali metal
initiator, optionally followed by coupling of living copolymer
chains by the addition of a coupling agent to the polymerization
mixture. Diepoxy compounds were mentioned among many others as
suitable coupling agents. As the stabilizer package there was
actually used a combination of tris(nonyl-phenyl)phosphite (TNPP)
and octadecyl-3-(3',5'-di-tert.butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionate
(IRGANOX 1076, IRGANOX is a trade mark). The decolourisation
process involves the addition of a monocarboxylic acid of the
formula R-COOH with R representing a group containing 2 to 4 carbon
atoms. It will be understood that the use of acids for obtaining
colour-stable polymers is undesired from a manufacturing point of
view, as the use of acids puts severe demands upon the equipment
due to their corrosive nature. Also in view of safety and
environmental hazards it is preferred to avoid the use of acids.From U.S. Patent No. 4,835,200 a color stable, heat resistant
hot melt adhesive composition is known comprising a monoalkenyl
arene-conjugated diene block copolymer prepared by using a bromide
based coupling agent, a tackifying resin, optionally a plasticizing
oil and/or a petroleum wax and a specific stabilizer composition.
This stabilizer composition essentially consists of four
components: (i) a thio compound being 6-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-t-butylanilino)-2,4-bis-octylthio-1,3,5-triazine,
(ii) a phenolic 
antioxidant, (iii) a tris-(nonylated phenyl)phosphite and (iv) an
aliphatic compatible epoxy compound. The stabilizer composition
employed contains a relatively large number of components, which
may be the result of the use of a bromide containing coupling
agent. Apart from the relatively high costs of such extensive
stabilizer composition, the use of a coupling agent containing
bromide is undesired for environmental reasons. Upon waste
disposal, e.g. by incineration, of articles containing the hot melt
adhesive composition disclosed in said U.S. patent there is always
the risk of toxic bromine compounds releasing into the environment.
Hence, there is a need for hot melt adhesive compositions which are
free of bromide residues, and of
