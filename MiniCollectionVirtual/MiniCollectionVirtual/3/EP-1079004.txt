<ABSTRACT>
A method of etching an alloy of aluminium and
neodymium by exposing the alloy to a plasma formed

from a gas mixture of chlorine and hydrogen iodide
(HI). The hydrogen iodide etches the neodymium

component of the alloy, and the chlorine etches the
aluminium component. Preferably, the gas mixture

further includes BCl

 to provide sputter etching by
boron ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plasma etch processes used in the manufacture of electronic devices
such as liquid crystal displays and integrated circuits. More specifically, the invention relates to
processes for etching interconnect lines composed of aluminum-neodymium alloy.Aluminum is the most commonly used material for fabricating interconnect lines in thin film
transistor liquid crystal displays and in integrated circuits on silicon wafers. Instead of using pure
aluminum, it has been proposed to form the interconnect lines of an alloy of aluminum and a small
percentage of neodymium in order to minimize the formation of hillocks in the lines.One obstacle to the use of aluminum-neodymium alloy is the difficulty of etching the
neodymium component. Conventional plasma processes for etching aluminum, such as those based
on BCl3 and Cl2 gas mixtures, do not effectively etch neodymium, so that neodymium residue remains
after the aluminum has been completely etched.Therefore, a need exists for a plasma etch process that effectively etches aluminum-neodymium
alloys.The present invention is a process and apparatus for etching an alloy of aluminum and
neodymium using a plasma formed from a gas mixture of chlorine and hydrogen iodide (HI). The
hydrogen iodide is especially effective at etching the neodymium component of the alloy, and the
chlorine is especially effective at etching the aluminum component. Preferably, the gas mixture further
includes BCl3 to provide sputter etching by boron ions.Tests of our preferred embodiments of the etching process produced metal features having
desirably smooth side wall surfaces. Additionally, we could control the taper of the side wall to
achieve a desired angle between the side wall and the plane of the top or base of the metal features. We
also found that our preferred etching process did not leave any corrosive residue.

The following drawings are provided by way of example.Figures 1-4 are sectional views of a substrate showing various stages of etching using the
process of the present invention.Figure 1 shows the final stage after removal of the photoresist.Figure 2 shows the initial stage before etching. Figure 3 shows the substrate after etching of the metal film, before removal of the photoresist.Figure 4 shows the same stage as Figure 3, but with undercutting of the metal film due to
insufficient HI.Figure 5 is a schematic side view of a plasma chamber suitable for performing the etch process
of the invention.The present invention is a process and apparatus for
