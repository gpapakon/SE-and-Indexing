<ABSTRACT>
A modular assembly for separating a passenger 
compartment from an engine compartment in an automotive 

vehicle body comprises three structural cross car 
members that combine to provide sufficient cross car 

stiffness between the side pillars so as to eliminate 
any need for an upper cross car beam at the cowl of the 

vehicle body. The three structural cross car members 
include a front of dash panel, an intermediate close out 

panel and an instrument panel carrier that form two rows 
of ducts for meeting the needs of the heating, 

ventilating and air conditioning system of the vehicle 
and the wiring requirements of the instrument panel. 

The instrument panel carrier is part of a covered 
instrument panel subassembly that includes a shell and 

an underlying foam cushion. The foam cushion is foamed 
in place in a mold that includes a slide and pivot 

mechanism for manipulating a mold lid and clamp between 
a closed clamped position and a shaping position where 

the molded subassembly is accessible for a shaping 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a modular splashboard assembly for 
separating a passenger compartment from an engine compartment 
in an automotive vehicle body. U.S. Patent 4,391,465 granted to Renzo Piano July 5, 1983 
discloses an assembly separating a passenger compartment from 
an engine compartment comprising a first element (commonly 
referred to as a front of dash or "FOD" panel) of high 
mechanical and flame resistance material and a second element 
(commonly referred to as an instrument panel or dashboard) of 
lower hardness and mechanical resistance material. The FOD 
panel has an upper portion that supports the instrument panel 
and integral housings for accommodating members and devices 
of a heating and ventilation system. The FOD panel also 
generates with the instrument panel cavities and channels for 
the heating and ventilation system that are not disclosed in 
detail. However, it is clear that the Piano assembly provides 
only one row of channels which may not be adequate to meet 
the comfort needs of today's vehicle passengers. Moreover, 
the Piano assembly requires use of a separate cross car beam 
at the cowl that must be threaded through the assembly  
 
in some fashion thus possibly further limiting the 
number of channels that are available for meeting the 
comfort needs of the vehicle passengers. U.S. Patent 5,005,898 granted to Piero 
Benedetto, Salvatore Bezzi and Paola Odone April 9, 1991 
discloses a vehicle structure comprising a FOD panel 
for closing an opening between a passenger compartment 
and an engine compartment and an instrument panel that 
is mounted directly against the face of a rigid element 
of the FOD panel. The FOD panel includes an upper 
portion formed substantially as a cross member and 
provided with integral brackets for connection to the 
vehicle body. The Benedetto structure also includes an 
air conditioning unit however the patent drawings and 
specification do not show or disclose any detail of the 
heating and ventilating ducts. U.S. Patent 5,082,078 granted to Takashi Umeda 
et al January 21, 1992 discloses a motor vehicle 
structure comprising a cowl unit that is inserted into 
the top of an engine compartment and an instrument panel 
unit that is inserted into a passenger compartment from 
a door opening. The instrument panel unit comprises an 
instrument panel, a steering system, an air conditioning 
unit, a tube member (cross car beam) and brackets. The 
brackets attach the tube member to the side pillars as 
shown in figures 5 and 6. The

A modular splashboard assembly (10) for separating a 
passenger compartment from an engine compartment between 

side pillars (14) in an automotive vehicle body (12), 
comprising a plurality of structural cross car members 

(18, 20, 22) which are combined to provide an upper 
cross car beam with sufficient cross car stiffness when 

attached between the side pillars (14) so as to 
eliminate any need for another upper cross car beam at 

the cowl of the vehicle body, said structural cross car 
members (18, 20, 22) including a front of dash panel 

(18), said assembly being characterized in that said 
structural cross car members (18, 20, 22), in addition 

to said front of dash panel (18), include an instrument 
panel carrier (22) and an intermediate panel (20) 

arranged between the instrument panel carrier (22) and 
the front of dash panel (18), and that said structural 

cross car members (18, 20, 22) are shaped and combined 
such that they form a set of horizontal ducts (26, 28, 

30; 54, 56, 58) on each of two opposite sides of said 
intermediate panel (20), the ducts of each set being 

disposed vertically one upon another. 
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the intermediate panel 
(20) has the shape of a close out panel partially 

forming each of the ducts (26, 28, 30; 54, 56, 58) in 
each set of ducts.  

 
The assembly of claim 2, wherein the intermediate panel
