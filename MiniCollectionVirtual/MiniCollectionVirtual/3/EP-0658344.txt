<ABSTRACT>
A liposome preparation containing, incorporated in liposome, an immunosuppressive tricyclic compound or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof. Since the tricyclic compound is incorporated in liposome stably and quantitatively, a pharmaceutical 

preparation with an excellent persistence of drug efficacy can be provided in a wide variety of preparation forms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical liposome
preparation containing a tricyclic compound or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof shown by the
general formula (I) presented hereinafter, which is
attracting attention as a substance having a potent
immunosuppresive action, as an active ingredient, and
more particularly, it relates to a liposome preparation
comprising said active ingredient stably entrapped in
liposomes and as a consequence capable of remaining
stable solution in various media such as physiological
saline, glucose solution for injection, water or juices
and, hence, being applicable to various methods of
administration including injections such as intravenous
injection, intramuscular injection, and topical injections
for intraarticular and the like, topical administration
such as application to skin, instillation into 
the eye, nasal administration, and inhalation, and
further, oral administration and rectal administration
etc.A compound represented by the following general
formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof has been known as a substance showing immunosupressive
activity (refer to
JP-A-61-148181 and
EP-A-0323042), for which application uses in various medical
fields have been expected, including transplantation of
organs such as heart, liver, kidney, bone marrow, skin,
cornea, lung, pancreas, small intestine, nerve, limb:
