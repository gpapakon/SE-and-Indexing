<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to electronic mail
systems and more particularly to an electronic mail system for
communicating messages via a selective call receiver.Electronic mail systems typically employ a wired or
wireless local area network (LAN) that communicates message
data from a user (source) to at least one other user
(destination). The local area network may include network
communication devices that selectively route the message data
in and out of the LAN to provide long-distance communication
capability over a wide area network (WAN).Several methods are available to implement a WAN. A
first method utilizes a transparent "bridge" that allows
uncensored, bi-directional data transfer between connected
network segments. Network bridges are the simplest method for
interconnecting multiple LAN's, but they do not implement
security features that may be necessary to prevent
unauthorized access of message data outside of the LAN by
"hackers" (e.g., an overly curious system user that attempts
to monitor communications not intended for that user). A
second and better method of interconnecting multiple LAN's can
be implemented using a router. Conventional routers allow
control over the distribution of message data by supervising a
virtual (peer to peer) connection between users and/or
electronic mail centers. In order to connect to a distant
destination through a router, the user's addresses (source and
destination address) must be authorized in the router's access
control list. Access to a remote destination is denied when a
user attempts an unauthorized connection through a router.
WAN messaging systems that use routers with access control
lists yield a significant improvement in security over a
bridge coupled WAN system. However, since conventional wired 
and/or wireless network topologies may implement bi-directional
communications, and furthermore, since there must
be an access code for administering the router's access
control list, there is still an avenue to breach the security
of private data messages transmitted over the WAN.A solution to this security problem can be had using one
way selective call communication technology. One way
communication systems typically use a receiver (e.g., a
selective call receiver or "pager") that has at least one
unique call address associated therewith. These radios
receive and decode an address, then typically alert a
destination user to the presence of incoming information and
operate to present this information. One way radio
communication systems have
