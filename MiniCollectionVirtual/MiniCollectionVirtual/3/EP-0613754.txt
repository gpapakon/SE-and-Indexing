<ABSTRACT>
A pallet, for use in a numerical control router, 
comprises a base (25) on which one or more process boards 

(3) are to be carried, characterised in that there is at 
least one supporting member which is attached to at least 

part of a peripheral portion of the base (25) and presents 
at least one supporting portion (28) for supporting a 

sacrifice board (30), with the result that slipping and 
sliding of the sacrifice board (30) on the process boards 

(3) is avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pallets for carrying 
a sacrifice board as well as one or more process boards to 
be processed in a numerical control router. A process system for a numerical control router is 
disclosed in JP-A-2-301385 (or EP-A-0 485 223). In that numerical 
control router, a traverser is moved in front of a selected shelf 
in a storehouse, whereupon a pallet having a process board 
carrying a sacrifice board is put on the traverser and is 
carried to a supply conveyer. When the supply conveyer 
moves the pallet to a predetermined position, a robot first 
positions the sacrifice board and then the process board on 
a table so that the process board can be processed. A problem arises when the process board is smaller 
than the sacrifice board, because as the pallet is moved, 
the sacrifice board tends to slide on the process board and 
can even fall off the process board. A pallet according to the present invention, however, 
for use in a numerical control router, comprises a base on 
which one or more process boards and a sacrifice board are to be 
carried, characterised in that there is at least one supporting 
member which is attached to at least part of a peripheral 
portion of the base and presents at least one supporting 
portion for supporting a sacrifice board. Preferably, the or each of the supporting members 
further presents at least one locating portion for locating 
the sacrifice board, and the or each of the locating 
portions is in the form of a stop plate. There may be at least two of the supporting members 
positioned along each of at least two of the sides of the 
base. Alternatively, there may be only one of the 
supporting members positioned along each of at least three 
of the sides of the base. In the latter case, the  
 
supporting members may be in the form of a rectangular 
frame. Preferably, the or each of the supporting members is 
attached to the base by at least one pole. It will be appreciated that, in use, a process board 
is carried by the base, inwardly of the at least one 
supporting member, and a sacrifice board is supported by 
the at least one supporting member, there being no need for 
contact between the sacrifice board and the top process 
board, with the result that the sacrifice board is 
supported without being influenced by the size or 
slippiness of the top process board. Several pallets, according to the present invention, 
as well as a numerical control router process system, will 
now be described in greater detail, by way of example

<CLAIMS>
A pallet, for use in a numerical control router, 
comprising a base (25) on which one or more process boards and a 

sacrifice board (3) are to be carried, characterised in that there 
is at least one supporting member (26; 31; 35; 39) which is 

attached to at least part of a peripheral portion of the 
base (25) and presents at least one supporting portion (28; 

33; 37; 41) for supporting the sacrifice board (30). 
A pallet according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the or each of the supporting members (26; 31; 35; 39) 

further presents at least one locating portion (29; 34; 38; 
42) for locating the sacrifice board. 
A pallet according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the or each of the locating portions (29; 34; 38; 42) is in 

the form of a stop plate. 
A pallet according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that there are at least two of the 

supporting members (26; 39) positioned along each of at 
least two of the sides of the base. 
A pallet according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that there is only one of the supporting 

members (31; 35) positioned along each of at least three of 
the sides of the base. 
A pallet according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the supporting members (35) are in the form of a 

rectangular frame. 
A pallet according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the or each of the supporting members 

(26; 31; 35; 39) is attached to the base (25) by at least 
one pole (27; 32; 36; 40). 
A pallet according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that a process board (3) is being carried 

by the base (25), inwardly of the at least one supporting 
member, and a sacrifice board (30) is being supported by 

the at least one supporting member (26; 31; 35; 39).
