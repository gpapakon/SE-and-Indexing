<ABSTRACT>
An interdental toothbrush has a hinged locking 
retainer (22) on the end of an elongated handle (20) 

for capturing the stem (ST) of a twisted wire 
brush (26). The locking retainer has a hole (36) which 

is adapted to receive the stem (ST) of a twisted wire 
brush. A land (52) is formed in the handle adjacent a 

groove (53) so that the wire brush stem (ST) is 
captured between that land area (52) and a land 

area (54) on the retainer. A latch (42) on the locking 
retainer has a top end (44) with a double cam 

surface (53, 54) thereon. One of the cam surfaces (54) 
guides the latch (42) into a locking position as the 

retainer is closed. The other (53) of the cam surfaces 
releases the locking retainer when pushed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to handles for interdental
toothbrushes, and more particularly to toothbrush
handles which have a lower cost and which,
nevertheless, firmly and securely hold a twisted wire
brush in place.A number of U.S. patents show interdental
toothbrushes: 3,559,226; 4,303,199; 4,222,143;
4,319,377; 4,572,223; 4,691,404; 4,710,996;
4,751,761; 4,780,923; 4,805,252 and 5,029,358.A regular toothbrush is severely limited as to the
tooth and gum surfaces that it can reach. One
importance of brushing includes a cleaning of the tooth
itself. However, it also includes a massaging of the
gums and a cleaning of the sulcus or marginal area
below the nominal gum line and between the tooth and
gum. This massaging tends to thicken the gum tissue
and to make it healthier.As a result of these needs, it is common practice
to provide a small twisted wire brush which may fit
within and through the spaces between, around, and
under teeth, bridges, and the like. This use of a
twisted brush leads to two problems. One problem is to
provide a brush which projects from a handle at
approximately a right angle thereto. The other problem
is to securely lock the brush in place at the lowest
possible cost. The locking is a relatively severe
problem since there is a substantial leverage acting
upon the brushes. The low cost is also a relatively
severe problem since the field of personal appliances,
especially toothbrushes, is a highly competitive
field. In many countries, they custom and usage is to use
very small diameter devices, such as toothpicks, for
interdental cleaning. When people in these countries
use interdental brushes which are commonly used in the
United States, they find the twisted wire too thick for
their preference. Therefore, there is a need to
provide an interdental brush with a very fine wire stem
(in the order of (0.25mm) 0.010-inch diameter wire).Another consideration is the convenience for the
user. Many people who have bridges or a large gap
between their teeth, especially at the root line, are
quite elderly. Their hands may be stiff, their
eyesight impaired, etc. Thus, there may be many
reasons why they find it difficult to use some of the
prior art interdental handles where the brush stem has
to be manipulated. Therefore, the ease of brush
installation and replacement is also an important
consideration.Our European Patent Application No. 0 441 597
shows an improved locking arrangement for capturing the
twisted wire brush, and also discloses providing an
improved capturing of the twisted wire

<CLAIMS>
A toothbrush handle for holding a twisted wire
brush (26), said toothbrush handle comprising an

elongated handle member (20) having a hinged locking
retainer (22) at an end thereof and a means (42,46) for

releasably locking said retainer and handle member in a closed position,
said locking retainer (22) and handle member (20)

having smooth contours when closed, a hole (36) formed
in one of said handle member (20) and said locking

retainer (22) near said hinged end, said hole (36)
having a dimension for receiving and holding a

stem (ST) of the twisted wire brush (26), and a
groove (40) formed in the other of said handle

member (20) and said locking retainer (22), said
toothbrush handle being characterised by a first land (52)

between said hole (36) and said groove (40), said
groove (40) extending from said first land from a

point near but not opposite said hole when said
retainer (22) is closed, whereby when closed said stem (ST) is

gripped between said first land (52) and a second
land (54) which opposes said first land and said

groove (40) having a dimension for receiving and
holding said stem (ST).
The toothbrush handle of claim 1 characterised in
that said one of said handle member (20) and locking

retainer (22) has a protrusion which extends outwardly
from said retainer (22) to form a somewhat chimney-like

extension (37) of said hole (36) for stabilizing and
reinforcing the stem (ST) of said wire brush.
The toothbrush handle of claim 1 wherein said
hinged end has a member (30) with a triangular cross

section separating two living hinges (32,34) for 
joining said member (30) to said handle member (20) and

to said locking retainer (22) respectively.
The toothbrush handle of claim 3 characterised in
that said stem (ST) of said twisted wire brush forms an

L-shape automatically in response to a closing of said
locking retainer (22) over said handle member (20).
The toothbrush handle of any one of the claims 1-4
characterised in that the stem(ST) of said twisted wire

brush (26) has a diameter in the order of 0.254mm
(0.010-inches).
The toothbrush handle of any one of the claims 1-5
characterised in that said first land (52) between said

hole (36) and said groove is approximately (1.07mm)
0.042-inch wide.
A toothbrush handle according to any preceding
claim in which said locking means comprises a

latch (42) on one of said handle member (20) and
retainer and a keeper hole (46) which is complementary

to said latch on the other of said locking retainer and
handle member, said latch entering said keeper hole when

said locking retainer is swung on said handle member.
An interdental toothbrush which includes a
toothbrush handle according to any preceding claim and

a twisted wire brush.
