<ABSTRACT>
A slot machine having a game performing system for 
performing games, a coin dispensing/settling system for 

dispensing coins and settling accounts, and a system for 
handling coins. The system for handling coins has an internal 

hopper (1) for keeping coins taken thereinto from the 
outside as well as discharging coins and a coin storing tank 

(2) having a capacity greater than that of the internal hopper 
(1). In addition, the system further has a control mechanism 

for transferring coins between the internal hopper 
(1) and the coin storing tank (2) so as to control the amount 

of coins contained in the internal hopper (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slot machine having unitary coin 
restoration system wherein a given quantity of coins can always 
be held while coins are caused to flow back into an internal 
hopper of the slot machine. For example, each of conventional slot machines disposed in 
a slot machine dome has an internal hopper through which coins 
are dispensed, entered coins are accepted, or coins paid out to a 
customer are accepted for circulation. However, the capacity of the internal hopper is limited from 
the viewpoint of the size of the slot machine. Thus, if the 
customer has coins for himself or herself, the coins in the slot 
machine may increase. Also, the customer may take home coins 
that are paid out, in which case the number of coins in the slot 
machine decreases. When the coins in the slot machine increase 
or decrease substantially, the slot machine must be stopped in 
order to take out coins from the internal hopper or replenish the 
internal hopper with coins. This job causes personnel in the  
 
gaming house a lot of trouble and is inconvenient to the customer. 
Moreover the availability of the slot machine deteriorates. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a slot 
machine designed so that the number of coins in an internal hopper in 
the slot machine can always be maintained at a given quantity. To this end, the invention relates to a slot machine according to 
claim 1, US-A-4,342,384 discloses a slot machine being provided with 
a controller and comprising an internal hopper for dispensing coins. 
However, this reference neither discloses nor suggests the coin taking-in 
mechanism for taking in coins from outside to inside of the slot 
machine, having the coin taking-in device for taking in coins from the 
tray to the inside of the slot machine, the taking-in sensor for counting 
the number of taken-in coins, and the upper limit sensor for detecting 
coins held in the tray reaching the upper limit of the tray. The coin storage tank of the slot machine of the invention can 
be disposed under the internal hopper. The adjustment mechanism can comprises an overflow 
passage for introducing coins exceeding an upper quantity limit in  
 
the internal hopper into the coin storage tank and a transport 
mechanism for transporting coins stored in the coin storage tank 
to the internal hopper. The adjustment mechanism can further include a lower limit 
sensor for detecting that the internal hopper holds a lower limit 
quantity of coins and an upper limit sensor for detecting that
