<ABSTRACT>
The field of the invention is that of radio communication of multiplexed data, and more particularly, although not exclusively, in TDMA mode. The objective is to supply a method making it possible to offer services with intelligent and optimised sharing of the traffic channels, particularly making it possible to route data originating from a secondary source over a traffic channel allocated to a main source (20, 30, 40). According to the invention, each of the said blocks transmitted by the main source, on the one hand, and the data from the said secondary source of data on the other hand, are each defined by one of at least three levels of informative importance (NIp = 0, 1, or 2; NIs = 0, 1, or 2), and data from the secondary source are substituted for a block sent by the main source as the result of a comparison between the respective levels of informative importance of the said data from the secondary source and block from the main source.

Method of transmitting data in a digital radio
system in which calls form main data sources and are

transmitted in the form of data streams between terminal
stations (11) and an infrastructure (10, 12) via traffic

channels, said data streams being made up of a succession
of data blocks,

method of the type adapted to convey data from a
secondary data source in a traffic channel assigned to a

main data source,

   characterized in that each block transmitted by the
main source and the data from said secondary data source

are each defined by one of at least three levels of
relative importance (NI
p
= 0, 1 or 2; NI
s
= 0, 1 or 2),
and data from the secondary source is substituted for a

block transmitted by the main source as the result of a
comparison between the respective relative importance

levels of said data from the secondary source and said
block from the main source.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in
that said main data source (20) transmits speech signals

and in that a level of relative importance (NI
p
) defining
a data block is supplied by relative level of importance

detector means (23) comprising vocal activity detectors
detecting periods of silence in the speech signal and

analyzers for evaluating areas in which the speech signal
is stationary.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in
that said main data source (30, 40) comprises data of

intermittent information content and in that said
relative level of importance detector means (35) comprise

a transmission pause detector.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterized in that said traffic channel multiplex is a

time-division multiplex in which each call is assigned a 

specific time slot and in that each time slot can convey
an integer number of data blocks.
Method according to claim 4 characterized in
that each time slot is divided into at least two

consecutive transmission blocks and in that the relative
levels of importance are defined selectively block by

block.
Method according to claim 4 or claim 5
characterized in that each time slot is divided into at

least two consecutive transmission blocks and in that
operations to substitute secondary source data for main

source data are effected selectively block by block.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6
characterized in that data supplied by said secondary

data source is stored in a FIFO buffer memory before it
is substituted for a main source data block.
Method according to claim 7 characterized in
that a maximum waiting time is assigned to at least some

of the stored secondary data, said data being transmitted
immediately instead of main source data regardless of the

instantaneous level of relative importance of said main
source data as soon as said maximal waiting time has

elapsed.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 8
characterized in that said secondary source data

constitutes a data transmission service adapted to
transmit messages with a short fixed size, generally one

time slot at most, and containing its destination address
explicitly or implicitly.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 9
characterized in that said secondary source data

constitutes a data packet transmission service adapted to
be connected to a speech service in the context of a

concurrent voice/data service.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 10 
characterized in that said secondary data (40) comprises

user signalling information including encryption and/or
synchronization information.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 12
characterized in that it is implemented in a radio

communication system to the TETRA standard.

the data to be transmitted on the basis of comparison of
the respective relative levels of importance of said

sources; and

information to be transmitted choice parameter to
authorize selectively transmission of data from one

source at a time (S
