<ABSTRACT>
The method controls a differential pressure of a 
plate reformer (9) installed in a fuel cell power 

generation system. In the power generation system, a 
raw material gas (NG) is reformed to a fuel gas in 

the plate reformer (9), the fuel gas is fed to an 
anode (3) of a fuel cell (FC), an anode exhaust gas 

from the anode (3) is fed to a combustion chamber 
(9b) of the plate reformer (9), a combustion exhaust 

gas from the combustion chamber (9b) is fed to a 
cathode (2) of the fuel cell (FC) together with an 

air, and part of the air is fed to the combustion 
chamber (9b). The method includes the steps of 

placing the plate reformer (9) in a pressure vessel 
(24), maintaining a pressure of a cathode exhaust 

gas to a constant value, feeding part of the air to 
be fed to the cathode (2) and all of the anode 

exhaust gas into the combustion chamber (9b) to make 
a pressure of the air and that of the anode exhaust 

gas substantially the same so as to make a pressure 
of the reforming chamber (9a) and that of the 

combustion chamber (9b) substantially the same, and 
forming an opening on a line which feeds the air into 

the combustion chamber (9b) to allow the gas in the 
line to enter the pressure vessel (24) so as to make 

the pressure of the reforming chamber (9a), that of 
the combustion chamber (9b) and that of the pressure 

vessel (24) substantially the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel cell power 
generation system which directly converts chemical 
energy of a fuel into electrical energy, and more 
particularly to a method of controlling a differential 
pressure of a plate reformer which is installed 
in the power generation system to reform the raw 
material to a fuel gas and feed the fuel gas into an 
anode of a fuel cell. Among various types of fuel cell power generation 
system, one of typical power generation systems 
incorporating a molten carbonate fuel cell utilizes 
a natural gas as a raw material gas. A fundamental 
structure of such a fuel cell power generation system 
will be described with reference to Figure 4 of the 
accompanying drawings. A fuel cell FC is a stack of fuel cell elements which 
are piled up with separators being interposed. Each 
cell element includes an electrolyte plate (tile) 1, 
a cathode (electrode) 2 and an anode (electrode) 3, 
and the tile 1 is sandwiched by these electrodes 2 
and 3. An air line 4 extends to the cathode 2 and an 
air A pressurized by a compressor 5 is introduced to 
the cathode 2 via an air preheater 6 through the air  
 
line 4. Gases discharged from the cathode 2 (called 
"cathode exhaust gas") flow in the air preheater 6 
and a steam generator (not shown) before being expelled 
to the atmosphere. A natural gas NG is used as a raw material gas in 
this power generation system. The natural gas NG is 
desulfurized by a desulfurizer (not shown) and mixed 
with a steam H2O. This mixture is introduced to a 
natural gas feed line 7 and flows in a natural gas 
preheater 8 and a reforming chamber 9a of a reformer 
9 in turn. The natural gas becomes a fuel gas as it 
is reformed in the reforming chamber 9a. The fuel 
gas flows in a fuel gas feed line 10 and the natural 
gas preheater 8 before it reaches the anode 3. Gases 
discharged from the anode 3 (called "anode exhaust 
gas") are introduced to a combustion chamber 9b of 
the reformer 9 by an anode exhaust gas line 11. In 
the combustion chamber 9b, combustible components in 
the anode exhaust gas are burned with the air fed 
from a line 12 branched from the air line 4. A 
combustion exhaust gas which contains CO2 and is 
discharged from the combustion chamber 9b proceeds to 
a heat exchanger 13 and a recycle blower 14. The 
exhaust gas is pressurized by the blower 14 and 
supplied to the cathode 2 together with the air. "M" 
indicates a motor. Flow rate control valves 15 and 17 are provided on 
the air feed line 4 and the natural gas feed
