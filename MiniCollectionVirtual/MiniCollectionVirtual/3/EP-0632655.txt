<ABSTRACT>
Reception-channel switching of a broadcast television set 
(1) is effected via a unit (4) that interfaces the set 

(1) with remote distribution equipment (13) of a cable 
network. Viewing-channel selection is communicated from 

a hand-held control (2) to an infra-red receiver (7) of 
the unit (4). The selection made is processed by a 

microprocessor (9) and associated memory (8) to derive 
control signals that are transmitted from an LED (11) to 

the infra-red receiver (6) of the set (1), to switch the 
set (1) to the appropriate reception channel. If a cable 

channel is selected from the control (2), the 
microprocessor (9) also supplies command signals to a 

microprocessor (16) which controls a tuner (12) of the 
distribution equipment (13) to select the relevant 

channel signal. The selected signal is supplied to the 
set (1) via an input cable (5) to the unit (4), and this 

same cable (5) is used for transmission of the command 
signal from the unit (4) to the equipment (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to television apparatus. The invention is especially concerned with television 
apparatus for use in combination with television 
broadcast receiving sets to facilitate control of 
operation of such sets. Television broadcast receiving sets are conventionally 
constructed to be switchable between a number of 
reception channels that is normally adequate for 
reception of off-air television stations alone, but is 
generally inadequate where enhanced services, such as 
cable or satellite television systems are to be utilised 
also. The inadequacy is generally overcome by arranging 
that one of the reception channels of the television set 
is specifically allocated to reception of the enhanced-service 
signals, and that selection of the particular 
channel of the enhanced service which is to be input to 
the set in the allocated channel, is made through a 
separate control unit. Accordingly, in order to select 
one of the enhanced-service channels it is normally 
necessary to make two selections, one in the television 
set to switch it to the allocated reception channel, and 
the other in the enhanced-service control unit to select 
the enhanced-service channel required. The need to make two selections, one in the set and the 
other in the control unit, is of significant disadvantage 
and for many is especially confusing and burdensome where 
the television set and the control unit are of the kind 
that are switched using hand-held remote-controls. 
Separate remote-controls are normally required, one to 
control channel selection, standby and adjustment 
functions of the television set, and the other for 
channel selection within the enhanced-service control  
 
unit. Even where a single, universal hand-control is 
available, it must nonetheless be used to signal to the 
set for some functions and to the control unit for 
others. It is one of the objects of the present invention to 
provide television apparatus by which the above 
disadvantages may be overcome. According to the present invention there is provided 
television apparatus for use in combination with a 
broadcast television receiving set, characterised in that 
said apparatus includes data processing means and 
associated memory and is operative to control reception-channel 
switching in the set in accordance with a 
selection communicated as an input to said apparatus, and 
to supply to the set a television signal for reception in 
the selected reception channel, the television signal 
supplied in this latter respect
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Television apparatus for use in combination with a 
broadcast television receiving set (1), characterised in 

that said apparatus includes data processing means (9) 
and associated memory (8) and is operative to control 

reception-channel switching in the set (1) in accordance 
with a selection communicated as an input (at 7) to said 

apparatus, and to supply to the set (1) a television 
signal for reception in the selected reception channel, 

the television signal supplied in this latter respect 
being, in dependence upon response of the processing 

means (9) to the input selection, selected (at 12) within 
the apparatus from a multiplicity of such signals 

supplied to the apparatus. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 including an infrared 
or other remote-control facility (7) for receiving 

control signals transmitted thereto (from 2) in the 
communication of said input selection to the apparatus, 

and wherein the data processing means (9) is operative to 
exercise said control of reception-channel switching in 

dependence upon the control signals received by the 
remote-control facility (7). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein 
selection of the television signal for supply to the set 

(1) is made by a tuner or other signal-channel selector 
(12) which is switched in accordance with command signals 

that are derived by the processing means (9) in 
dependence upon the input selection communicated to said 

apparatus. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 wherein the 
processing means (9) and its associated memory (8) are 

part of a unit (4) for interfacing the television set (1) 
 

with television-signal distribution equipment (13) that
