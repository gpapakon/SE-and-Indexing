<ABSTRACT>
The device makes it possible to measure the force exerted, by a spacer grid spring, on a fuel rod passing through the grid. It comprises an elongated body (20) connected by two flexible blades (22), parallel to the elongation direction, to two respective posts (24) intended to be inserted into a cell, at least one of the posts supporting a force sensor (62) intended to be applied against the spring; an equipment item sliding in the body along the latter between a position in which it separates the posts while keeping them parallel and gives them a separation corresponding to the nominal diameter of a rod, and a position in which it allows the flexible blades to return the posts towards one another; and means (34, 30) making it possible to move the mobile equipment item between the two positions at will.

A device for measuring the force exerted by a spring 
of a supporting grid on a fuel rod passing through the 

grid,
 
   characterized in that it comprises: an elongate body 

(20) connected by two flexible blades (22) that are 
parallel to the longer direction, to two respective beams 

(24) designed to be inserted in a cell, at least one of 
the beams carrying a force sensor (62) designed to be 

pressed against the spring; equipment slidable in the 
body along the body between a position in which it spreads 

the beams apart while keeping them parallel to give them a 
spacing that corresponds to a nominal diameter of a fuel 

rod, and a position in which it allows the flexible blades 
to move the beams towards each other; and 

displacement means (34, 30) for moving the movable equipment 
at will between the two positions. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said equipment comprises a longitudinally displaceable 

connecting rod (36) connected to the beams (24) by arms 
that make up a deformable parallelogram. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said equipment comprises at least two sets of ramps (70) 

co-operating with cams (72) provided on the beams (24). 
A device according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that the displacement means are provided 

with adjustment elements (54, 56, 58) for limiting their 
stroke and enabling the separation of the beams to be 

adjusted so as to be equal to the nominal diameter of a 
fuel rod. 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the adjustment elements comprise a stop-forming bush (54) 

that is longitudinally displaceable and that limits the  
 

amplitude of displacement away from a rest position of an 
assembly belonging to the moving equipment and comprising 

a piston (30) and a piston rod (28), and wedge (56) for 
bearing against the bush and enabling the longitudinal 

position thereof to be adjusted. 
A device according to any preceding claim, for measuring 
the force exerted by a double spring having an active 

branch on either side of a common cell wall, characterized 
in that it comprises two beam-and-flexible blade assemblies 

carried by a common housing (76). 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the assemblies are independently mounted on the common 

housing by means (78) enabling them to pivot about an 
axis parallel to the direction in which the beams are 

separated. 
A device according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the outer blade (22a) in each assembly is less 

flexible than the inner blade (22b) thereof, which inner 
blade is designed to bear against the double spring.
