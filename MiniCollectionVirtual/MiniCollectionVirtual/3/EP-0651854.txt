<ABSTRACT>
A process and an arrangement are disclosed for operating a composite power station with a circulating fluidized bed furnace for solid fuels, in particular brown coal. The object of the invention is to recover and use combustion gas with high caloric values, i.e. to ensure an optimum post-combustion of the flue gas in order to achieve a maximum entrance temperature in the gas turbine. For that purpose, the flue gas partial current (15) is diverted in the substoichiometrically operated area of the fluidized bed furnace, upstream of the secondary air inlet (5), or the boiler is substoichiometrically operated as a carburetor and fresh air is added to the flue gas after the flue gas is cleaned and before it is subsequently burned. To implement this process, the combustion gas channel (15) is embedded in the substoichiometrically operated area of the fluidized bed furnace, upstream of the secondary air inlet (5), or the air channel is subdivised upstream of the boiler into controllable partial channels. One partial channel is embedded in the fluidized bed furnace and the other partial channel is embedded in the flue gas channel or in the post-combustion device.

<CLAIMS>
Method for operating a combined power station with a 
boiler for solid fuels, in particular, lignite coal, said 

boiler being operated at an understoichiometrical state 
and comprising a circulating fluidized-bed firing 

equipped with a primary combustion air supply duct and, 
optionally, a secondary or tertiary combustion air supply 

duct, and where flue gas is purified and immediately 
reheated using this circulating fluidized bed and is 

subsequently fed to the gas turbine in the form of hot 
gas, said boiler being operated similar to a carburettor, 

with filtered air being added to the flue gas after its 
purification for afterburning,
characterized in that
 
the air is distributed to the boiler and the afterburning 

assembly at a proportion of 1 : 1 to 2 : 1, thus yielding 
an operating air ratio in the boiler of Î» = 0.5 to 0.7 

whereas the proportion of combustion air/filtered air is 
controlled depending on fuel quality.
