<ABSTRACT>
The mobile communication system (MRS) establishes a communication and logs the transaction with a mobile subscriber (A). Subscriber data (VCR,HLR) and credit account selection are used. Network elements (SSP,SCP) form part of an intelligent network which can selectively establish the connection. A processor (DC) built into the service control unit allows the call charges to be determined and logged.

<CLAIMS>
A mobile-radio network (MRS) comprising a mobile
switching center (MSC) and a subscriber database (VLR,

HLR) by means of which incoming calls from mobile
subscribers (A) each having a prepaid account are

selected, said mobile subscribers (A) being entitled
to use mobile-radio services until their credit is

exhausted,
characterized in
 that network
elements (SSP, SCP) of an intelligent network switch

the selected calls through and implement call charging,
that the network elements comprise a service switching

point (SSP), which is connected to or incorporated in
the mobile switching center (MSC), and a service

control point (SCP), which is connected to the service
switching point and includes an arithmetic unit (DC)

for call charging, that the service control point
(SCP) forces a release of the connection if a credit

is exhausted, and that the service switching point
(SSP) comprises means (IP) for signaling call charge

information to the respective mobile subscriber (A)
which causes an indication of the charge information

before the release of the connection is forced.
A mobile-radio network (MRS) as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the signaling means (IP) signal

the call charge information in accordance with a
short-message protocol when the arithmetic unit (DC)

determines that the credit balance has fallen below a 
predeterminable amount (Dmin2).
A mobile-radio network (MRS) as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the means (IP) for signaling the

call charge information provide continuous information
about the account balance.
A method of switching through and charging for
incoming calls in a mobile-radio network (MRS),

comprising the steps of:

(1) selecting, within a mobile switching center
(MSC), incoming calls from mobile subscribers (A)

having respective prepaid accounts assigned to them by
means of predetermined subscriber profiles (SubCAT+)

and entitled to use mobile-radio services until their
credits are exhausted;
(2) subsequently switching the selected calls
through and charging for them by:
(2.1) establishing a connection for the selected
call if the prepaid account shows a predetermined

credit balance (Dmin1),

characterized in
 that the through-switching
and charging are performed by means of

network elements of an intelligent network, with the
connection for the selected call being established

within a service switching point (SSP) of the
intelligent network, and
(2.2) charging for the call within a service
control point (SCP) of the intelligent network by

consecutively deducting a predetermined unit fee from
the prepaid account, and
(2.2.1) signaling call charge information from
the service switching point (SSP) to the respective

mobile subscriber (A) before 
(2.3) the connection is released within the
service switching point (SSP) if the prepaid account

shows no credit balance.
A method as claimed in claim 4, characterized in
that between steps (2.2) and 2.3), the following steps

are taken:

(2.2.1) after the deduction of the respective
unit fee, determining a current credit balance and

signaling it to the service switching point (SSP); and
(2.2.2) signaling the current credit balance from
the service switching point (SSP) to the respective

mobile subscriber (A) by means of a short message.
A method as claimed in claim 4, characterized in
that between steps (2.2) and (2.3), the following

steps are taken:

(2.2.1) after the deduction of the respective
unit fee, determining a current credit balance and

signaling it to the service switching point (SSP) if
it corresponds to a predetermined minimum value

(Dmin2); and
(2.2.2) subsequently signaling said current
credit balance (Dmin2) from the service switching

point (SSP) to the respective mobile subscriber (A) by
means of a short message.
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in
that the predetermined minimum value (Dmin2)

corresponds to the predetermined credit balance
(Dmin1).
