<ABSTRACT>
A method of separating a liquid mixture wherein the 
liquid mixture is heated; the heated liquid mixture is 

supplied to a pervaporation membrane module to separate a 
permeable component of the liquid; a portion of non-permeated 

liquid is circulated through a circulation pipe 
into a liquid mixture feeding pipe before a heater, and 

the remaining portion of the non-permeated liquid is 
extracted to the outside of the system, said method being 

characterized in that the temperature of the liquid in 
the liquid mixture feeding pipe, in which the non-permeated 

liquid has been mixed with the liquid mixture 
or in the circulation pipe for the non-permeated liquid 

is measured, and when the measured temperature is out of 
a predetermined range, new supply of the liquid mixture 

and/or extraction of the non-permeated liquid is stopped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
separating a liquid mixture by pervaporation and an
apparatus suitable for conducting the method. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a method
of and an apparatus for separating a liquid mixture which
have good response to a change in the composition of the
liquid mixture.As a method of separating a liquid mixture, there has
been known a method called pervaporation wherein a
separation membrane which has a special affinity to a
specified component in a liquid mixture is used, the
liquid mixture is supplied on a side (a feed side) of the
membrane, and the pressure of the other side (a permeate
side) is reduced so as to keep the partial vapor pressure
of a permeated component in the permeate side to be
smaller than the equilibrium vapor pressure of the
component at the feed side, whereby the specified 
component is permeated for separation through the
membrane from the feed side to the permeate side in a
gaseous state.When the pervaporation method is conducted, the feed
side of the separation membrane is in contact with the
supplied liquid (the liquid mixture undergoing separating
operation) and the permeate side of the membrane (through
which the permeable component is passed) is reduced in
pressure. When the permeable component is permeated from
the feed side to the permeate side, it takes latent heat
of vaporization from the liquid. Accordingly, the
supplied liquid (at the feed side) should be heated.
Further, since the permeated component (at the permeate
side) is in a gaseous phase, a cooling device is usually
provided at the permeate side to condense the permeated
component.In the pervaporation method, it is preferable that
the temperature of the liquid mixture is increased so
that the equilibrium vapor pressure at the feed side
becomes higher. However, there is a drawback that the
temperature of the liquid mixture decreases due to the
latent heat of vaporization of the liquid. As a method
of efficiently supplying a heat quantity corresponding to
the latent heat of vaporisation, there has been known a
method of circulating a portion of non-permeated liquid
(U.S. Patent 5,151,190).In the pervaporation method, generally, the 
composition of the liquid is watched and controlled as
well as the monitoring and controlling of the temperature
of the liquid. For instance, in a pervaporation method
using a pervaporation membrane capable of selectively
permeating water from a liquid mixture composed of
isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and water, when the
