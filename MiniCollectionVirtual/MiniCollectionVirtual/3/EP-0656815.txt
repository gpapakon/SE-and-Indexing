<ABSTRACT>
A device for carrying out of a container the aggregates produced during reprocessing of residual concrete has a conveyor (10) of the worm-conveyor type. The conveying trough of said worm conveyor (10) is designed as a flexible elastic strip (16) provided with openings suitable only for the passage of aggregates no larger than the predetermined size of the aggregates transported by the worm conveyor (10).

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for conveying away the aggregates which have accumulated in a receptacle 
during the reprocessing of residual concrete, 


this apparatus having a first conveying device (10) in the form of a screw conveyor, 
the conveyor trough of this screw conveyor (10) being in the form of a flexible resilient 
surface (16), 
in this surface (16) there being openings (30) which do not allow the passage of 
aggregates (12) conveyed away by the screw conveyor (10) whose grain size is greater 

than a predetermined grain size, 
the screw conveyor surface region provided with the openings (30) being able to be 
acted upon by additional water, 
 
characterised in that 


at least one additional conveying device (40) is located, with any spatial orientation, 
below the screw conveyor (10), in such a manner that the at least one size fraction (32) 

falling through the openings (30) can be transported away by this conveying device (40), 
all conveying devices (10, 40) have a water conduit (14, 48) into the receptacle, the 
water conveyed out of the receptacle together with the aggregates being able to be 

returned to the receptacle again through this water conduit, 
the additional conveying device (40) has a feeding hopper (50) with a water overflow, 
this overflow is conductively connected to the water conduit (48) which leads back into 
the receptacle. 
An apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the at least one additional 
conveying device (40) is also a screw conveyor. 
An apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that this water is make-up 
water and/or water removed from the receptacle. 
An apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that 
the openings (30) are slits. 
An apparatus in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the slits (30) are directed 
transversely to the conveying direction of the screw conveyor (10).
