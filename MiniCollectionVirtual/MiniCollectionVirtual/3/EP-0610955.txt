<ABSTRACT>
Quaternized aminomethyl acrylamide polymer 
emulsions are treated by 1) adjusting the pH to about 3.6 

to about 4.8, 2) adding a formaldehyde scavenger, 3) 
adjusting the water content of the aqueous phase to 

result in about 10-45 weight percent of quaternized 
aminomethylated acrylamide polymer and 4) heating the 

resultant emulsion at from about 4O°C to about 80°C for 
about 3 to about 20 hours so as to render them more 

stable, capable of inversion in water independent of 
water temperature or pH of the medium flocculant and 

superior dewatering ability. The quaternized aminomethyl 
acrylamide polymer emulsions are especially useful as 

flocculating agent for suspended solids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to quaternized aminomethyl
acrylamide polymer microemulsions which are useful as
flocculants.The use and development of synthetic polymers as
flocculants has progressed and evolved since their
introduction in the early to mid 1950's. In use
flocculants provide the ability to flocculate solids
suspended in a liquid medium, usually aqueous, to form a
distinct entity capable of being separated from that
medium.Generally it is believed that the mechanism whereby
the destabilization of ionic suspended solids occurs is
by the neutralization of the charge on such solids which
contributes significantly to their suspension stability.
Mere neutralization of the charge of such solids, due to
their small size, is often insufficient to enable their
efficient separation from the liquid medium in which they
are suspended and it has been long recognized that
synthetic polymers are helpful in agglomerating such
solids into entities commonly referred to as flocculated
solids or flocs. These precipitate like flocs may then
be separated from the liquid medium in which they are
contained for various reasons and purposes. In the area
of water purification, such techniques are used to remove
materials undesirable for inclusion in discharge waters
and hence find their utility in the removal of materials
from the final product of a purification process. In
contrast, in the area of paper manufacture, such
techniques are used in a similar way to include within 
the paper slurry solids, and hence the resulting paper,
materials that would otherwise be lost from the paper
during the water removal phase of its manufacture and
which may also inhibit the efficiency of dewatering
during that phase.Most effectively, the source of charge
destabilization of suspended solids may be incorporated
into the synthetic polymer molecule by the use in the
formation of the polymer of monomers having moieties, or
by modifying polymers to provide such moieties on the
polymers, which moietes contain an ionic pair which upon
addition of the polymer to an aqueous medium, dissociate
to result in the polymer itself carrying a charge. Thus,
polymers useful in flocculation have developed to present
day being high molecular weight polymers which in the
presence of water form a polymeric flocculant medium to
provide a high content of cationically charged sites
combining the ability to both destabilize suspended
solids and to physically link them together into
insoluble entities thereby separating them from the
liquid medium in
