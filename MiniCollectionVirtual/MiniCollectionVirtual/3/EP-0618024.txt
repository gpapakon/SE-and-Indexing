<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a strand guide on continuous casting installations for the production of slabs, particularly by the continuous casting and rolling method, with rollers that can be adjusted to different strand thicknesses and are arranged opposite one another in pairs, these rollers being mounted on frame or stand parts of the strand guide that are connected by tie rods and their tie rods being formed by piston-cylinder units, and spacers being inserted between the upper and the lower frame parts in the force transmission path of the piston-cylinder unit. In order to design the strand guide in such a way that it is possible to adjust guide rollers into three defined positions in the partially solidified region, especially when continuously casting and rolling thin slabs, the invention proposes that a hydraulic ring cylinder (10,11), which surrounds the pistons (5) and the annular piston (11) of which carries the spacer (9) while being in non-positive engagement with it, is arranged between the spacers (9) and the cylinder (4) of the piston-cylinder unit (4,5).

A billet guide on continuous-casting plants for 
the production of slabs, in particular using the cast-rolling 

method, with rollers which are adjustable to 
different billet thicknesses and lie opposite one 

another in pairs, which rollers are mounted on frame or 
stand parts of the billet guide which are connected by 

tie rods and the tie rods of which are formed by 
piston-cylinder units and spacers are inserted in the 

flux of force of the piston-cylinder unit between the 
upper and lower frame parts,
 
characterised by
 
a hydraulic ring cylinder (10, 11) arranged between the 

spacer (9) and the cylinder (4) of the piston-cylinder 
unit (4, 5), which hydraulic ring cylinder surrounds 

the piston rod (5) and the ring piston (11) of which 
non-positively bears the spacer (9) and
 
the ring piston (11) is adjustable by a positioning 

path (X) which extends from a position in the pressure-relieved 
state, in which the frame parts (1, 2) are set 

to a distance between the rollers (12) which 
corresponds to the desired billet thickness during 

casting, to a position in the pressure-loaded state in 
which the frame parts (1, 2) are set to a distance 

between the rollers (12) which corresponds to the 
thickness of the dummy bar head. 
A billet guide according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the hydraulic ring cylinders (10, 11) are 

supported on side frames (3) and the side frames (3) 
join at least two under-frames (2) to form a segment of 

the billet guide.
