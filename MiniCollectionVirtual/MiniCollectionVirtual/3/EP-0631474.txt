<DESCRIPTION>
Certain embodiments of this invention were made with
Government support under Grant No. 5R01CA45288, awarded by the
National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute. The
Government has certain rights in this invention.The present invention relates generally to compounds,
therapeutic compositions and methods for preventing and treating
cancers, and more specifically to useful synthetic cyclic
anti-tumor promoter compounds, therapeutic compositions and
methods for their production and use.It is well known that cellular DNA can be modified by a
variety of agents, occasionally resulting in the creation of a
new cell species, such as tumor cells. The fact that
carcinogenic agents appear to be prevalent in the environment,
coupled with the relatively low occurrence of cancer in certain
populations, has suggested the presence of major
anti-carcinogenic factors in the environment as well.The multi-stage nature of carcinogenesis has been previously
shown for skin cancer (Berenblum, I., Cancer Res., 1, 44, 1941).
In this pioneering work, inflammatory croton oil, when painted
on the backs of mice, caused tumors only when the mice were
pretreated with a minute dose of a carcinogen that by itself
would be insufficient to cause cancer. It has been postulated 
that a carcinogen gives rise to a cell type indistinguishable
from normal cells until exposure to a promoting agent converts
it to a tumor cell. Many known tumor promoters are derivatives
of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the parent alcohol
of the tumor promoting compounds of croton oil. Other types of
tumor promoting agents include teleocidin, aplysiatoxin and
okadaic acid.Current hypotheses recognize three phases in tumor
development: Stage 1 -- initiation, Stage 2 -- promotion, and
Stage 3 -- progression to malignant neoplasm. In contrast to
tumor initiation, multiple applications or prolonged exposure to
a tumor promoting agent are believed to be required before tumor
growth becomes inevitable. The extended nature of Stage 2
appears to provide an opportunity to prevent tumor formation by
utilizing dietary and other components which inhibit the effects
of tumor promotion agents.The mechanism of tumor promotion displays a number of common
characteristics among the seemingly unrelated agents which
contribute to cancer, including protein kinase C activation,
protease activity, induction of oxygen radicals and
poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. Thus, as might be expected, numerous
agents have been shown to have some activity as anti-tumor
promotor
