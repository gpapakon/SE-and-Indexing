<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel injection device for pilot and main injection of different fuels. For this purpose a single-needle injection valve (9) of comparatively simple design, a specially functioning injection pump (1) and external means of control (19, 38, 40) are provided, by means of which, on completion of one injection, refilling of pilot injection fuel and main injection fuel can be performed with the aim of fuel stratification in the injection valve (9).

A fuel injection device for pilot and main injection of various fuels via a single-needle 
injection valve (9), in which device pilot injection fuel from low pressure feed means (36) 

is conveyed into the injection valve, is then fed through the spring chamber (23/2) 
containing the compression spring (30) acting upon the valve needle (20) in the closing 

direction, and via a channel (23; 23/4, 23/5, 23/6) into a cavity (21) in the valve needle, 
and, from there via throttle bores (25) adjacent the seat of the valve needle, is stored 

prior to use in the nozzle antechamber (26), and subsequently main injection fuel is 
conveyed from an injection pump (1) via an injection pipe (11), or directly, and via a 

channel (10) inside the valve also into the nozzle antechamber behind the pilot injection 
fuel stored prior to use, wherein the valve needle (20) is bored to form the cavity from its 

rear end coaxially up to the vicinity of its tip, the rear of this cavity (21) is closed by a 
partially extending spacer bolt (28) connected to the pressure plate (29) of the 

compression spring (30) and is fillable with pilot injection fuel via the filling bore (22) 
behind an annular stroke surface (33) of the valve needle in the rear half thereof, wherein 

a non-return valve (24) allowing flow only in the feed direction is fitted in the supply 
channel (23; 23/4, 23/5, 23/6) 
characterised in that
the filling bore (22) is formed as a transverse bore extending from an annular groove 
(34) present on the outside of the valve needle (20) and connecting in every valve needle 

position to the supply channel (23), 
the non-return valve (24) is fitted in an offset manner in the supply channel (23) inside 
the valve as close as possible before the joining of the said supply channel to the guide 

bore (35) for the valve needle (20), 
the main injection fuel supply channel (10) inside the valve is formed only by 
interconnecting bore sections without attachments, 
a correspondingly controllable solenoid valve (38) is fitted for exact metering, with 
respect to time and quantity, ofthe pilot injection fuel in an external feed pipe (37), 
a pump exit chamber (8) containing a delivery valve (14) and a compression spring 
(15), is attached to each pump chamber (7) of the injection pump (1), and the supply 

channel (10) inside the injection valve is attached to the said pump exit chamber either 
via an injection pipe (11) or directly, 
the injection pump (1) is only used to produce pressure and to advance the fuel pillar 
situated downstream of the delivery valve (14) in the adjacent pipe passages (8, 11, 10), 

wherein each delivery valve (14) acts as a pressure piston during the pump piston stroke, 
and also blocks a filling bore (16) leading to the side of the pump exit chamber (8), and  

 
when injection is over and the delivery valve (14) has been returned to the closed 

position the resulting cavity, corresponding to the injected quantity of fuel, in the said 
pipe passages (8, 11, 10) is refillable with main injection fuel by low pressure feed means 

(17) via the said filling bore, and is controlled shortly before or after the end of the pilot 
injection fuel refilling via a solenoid valve (19) fitted into a feed pipe (18). 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the supply channel 
(23) includes the spring chamber (23/2) containing the compression spring (30), an 

annular gap (23/3) around the pressure plate (29) and the spacer bolt (28), and continues 
with a transverse channel (23/4), a vertical bore (23/5) with the non-return valve (24) 

fitted therein, and an oblique bore (23/6) leading laterally to the receiving bore (35), 
guiding the valve needle (20), at the level of the filling bore (22). 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the two solenoid 
valves (19, 38) are controllable from electronic control means (40) operating on the basis 

of rotation angle signals (Ï•), supplied thereto, of the crankshaft or of a camshaft 
controlling the charge cycle valves or the pump pistons (2) ofthe injection pump (1), and 

with the opening and closing moments of the two solenoid valves (19, 38) being stored 
as rotation angle-dependent values therein. 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the two solenoid 
valves (19, 38) are included in a joint valve block (39), and the two supply pipes (18, 37) 

extend across the said valve block. 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 each of the two fuels 
is provided in its own storage tank (41, 42) and is deliverable therefrom through the 

associated low pressure feed means (17, 36). 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 each of the two low 
pressure feed means (17, 36) comprises a delivery pump (17/1, 36/1) and a pressure 

restricting valve (17/2, 36/2) restricting the supply pressure to approximately 2 to 4 bar. 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pump chambers 
(7) of the injection pump (1) are also suppliable with the appropriate fuel by the low 

pressure feed means (36) delivering the ignitable fuel. 
A fuel injection device according to Claim 1, 
characterised by
 the use thereof for pilot 
injection of diesel fuel and for main injection of a diesel water emulsion or ethanol.
