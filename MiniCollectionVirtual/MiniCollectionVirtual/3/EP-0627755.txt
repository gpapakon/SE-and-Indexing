<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improvement of a 
reflection mode alkali photocathode which relies on 

controlling a deposition weight of antimony. The 
reflection mode alkali photocathode according to this 

invention includes a thin layer of antimony directly 
deposited on a base substrate and activated by alkali 

metals. The thin film of antimony is deposited in a 
thickness of below 100 µg/cm². This reflection mode 

photocathode is suitably usable in photomultipliers. 
As the base substrate, nickel, aluminium and 

stainless, etc. are used. As the alkali metals, 
cesium, potassium, sodium and rubidium are usable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reflection mode
alkali (bialkali or multialkali) photocathode, and a
photomultiplier using it.Conventional photocathodes are in the form of
transmission mode photocathodes which emit electrons
in the direction opposite to that of the incident light,
i.e., incident photons are converted into photoelectrons and
transmitted, or of reflection mode
photocathodes which emit photoelectrons towards the
incident light, i.e., incident photons are converted into
photoelectrons and emitted back towards the
incident light. The reflection mode
photocathode comprises a base substrate, generally of a
metal. Reflection mode bialkali photocathodes and
reflection mode multialkali photocathodes having a
base substrates of nickel (Ni) are known. In the
reflection mode bialkali photocathode, antimony (Sb)
is deposited on the Ni base substrate and is activated
by potassium (K) and cesium (Cs). In
the multialkali photocathode, Sb is
deposited on a Ni base substrate and is activated by
K, Cs and sodium (Na). The amount of Sb deposition has
generally been above 200 µg/cm2, as will be explained
below. EP-A-05 32 358 (which falls within the terms of Article 54(3) EPC) describes a reflection type
photocathode for use in a photomultiplier tube formed
by sequentially depositing three layers on a nickel
substrate. The first layer is made of chromium,
manganese or magnesium as a major component and is
deposited over the substrate. The second layer is
made of aluminium as a major component and is
deposited over the first layer. The third layer is
made of antimony and at least one kind of alkali metal
and is deposited over the second layer."S-11 and S-20 photocathode research activity" by F. Gex
et al., Proc. SPIE-The International Society For Optical
Engineering, 1985, USA, SPIE vol 491, pages 287-293,
described a reflection type photocathode formed by
depositing upon a glass substrate a metal comprising
aluminium and nickel amongst others. Upon this metal
is deposited an antimony activated alkali photocathode of
up to 90 mm thickness. In the above-mentioned conventional reflection
mode alkali photocathodes, e.g., bialkali photocathodes,
their radiant sensitivity Sk is about 80 µA/Lm. Even
in a reflection mode bialkali photocathode having an
intermediate layer between the Sb layer and the base
substrate, maximum radiant sensitivity Sk is 120 µA/Lm.
Here µA/Lm represents sensitivity in
lumens. Lumen is a unit of luminous flux based
on visual sensitivity, and 1 Lm/m2 = 1 Lux. The
radiant sensitivity Sk
