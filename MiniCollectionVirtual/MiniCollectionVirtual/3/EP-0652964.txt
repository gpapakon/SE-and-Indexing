sequence SEQ ID No. 3.
Recombinant DNA according to Claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that
 it also contains one or more
structural genes.
Recombinant DNA according to Claim 4,

characterized in that
 it also contains signals
which allow secretion of the expression product of

the said structural gene or genes.
Recombinant DNA according to Claims 3 to 5,

characterized in that

realization of vaccines (hepatitis,
cytomegalovirus, Eppstein-Barr, herpes and the

like) or also fusions of polypeptides, such as, in
particular, fusions comprising an active part

fused to a stabilizing part (for example fusions
between albumin or albumin fragments and the virus

receptor or a part of a virus receptor (CD4 and
the like)).
