<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a toggle-lever mechanism (Y), on which the drive unit is held movably, an electromechanical drive is used, which converts a rotational movement into a linear movement of a drive element for the toggle lever. The length (h) of the lever (43) and the length (1) of the drive element, designed as an impression operating rack, is smaller here than the distance (e) from the contact surface up to articulation points (35, 36). Alternatively, a hollow-shaft motor may be provided as the drive device. As a result, both the linear drive and the mould closing unit can be made of a shorter and more compact design.

Mold closing unit for a plastic injection molding machine
comprising an electro-mechanical drive unit (A) being pivotally

connected via a toggle mechanism (Y) as well with the movable mold
carrier (12) as with a supporting element (13') and arranged

transverse to a mold closing direction (s-s), which drive unit is
freely movably suspended from the toggle mechanism (Y) and

comprises a driving element linked to the toggle mechanism for
moving the movable mold carrier into and out of a closed position

with the stationary mold carrier (11),
characterized in that the driving unit is a quill drive (H)

having as driving element a ball rolling spindle beared therein
and at least partly receivable therein.
Mold closing unit according to Claim 1, characterized in that a
sleeve (53) is arranged within the rotor (51) of the quill motor

(H), which sleeve is coaxially connected with a thread nut (54)
cooperating with the ball rolling spindle (41) and in which

sleeve the ball rolling spindle (41) is receivable.
Mold closing unit according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the ball rolling spindle (41) keeps the

toggle in the stretched position of the toggle mechanism (Y)
nearly self-retaining.
Mold closing unit according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that for mold height positioning at least one

spindle drive (39) is beared at a supporting element (13') and
fixable at the supporting element without backlash.
Mold closing unit according to Claim 4, characterized in that two
spindle drives (30) adjustable in working position via a common

drive (60) are provided, the backlash of threads of which is
surpressed by continuously acting disc springs (45) or by

threaded bushes (62) driven by a second drive preferably in
pressing to both sides of an abutment. 
Mold closing unit according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that the thread spindle (30a) of the spindle drive (39) is

prestressed to the supporting element (13') via tie bolts
arranged at a supporting ring (59) surrounding the thread

spindle.
Mold closing unit according to one of the preceding Claims
characterized in that the stationary mold carrier (11) fixedly

connected with the machine base or a part of it is pivotally
connected with a supporting element (13') for a closing mechanism

for the movable mold carrier (12) via at least one shackle (14)
constituting a force transmitting element, which summons at least

the forces generated during mold closure of the mold (31).
Mold closing unit according to Claim 7, characterized in that the
separate shackle deformable from the forces is freely suspended

and that the supporting element (13') is movable in closing
direction (s-s) along said machine base (10).
Mold closing unit according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized in
that the shackle (14) movably bears the supporting element (13')

in closing direction (s-s) at the machine base (10) in a neutral
area of the shackle (14) via bearing elements (46) arranged in a

plane (v-v) lying perpendicularly to the closing direction and
approximately passing through the link point (35) of the toggle

mechanism.
