<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of treating hepatitis B infections comprising the step of administering a vector construct which directs the expression of at least one immunogenic portion of a hepatitis B antigen, such that an immune response is generated. Also provided are methods for treating hepatitis C infections, as well as hepatocellular carcinomas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods for treating
hepatitis, as well as hepatitis-associated carcinomas.Hepatitis is a systemic disease which predominantly affects the liver.
The disease is typified by the initial onset of symptoms such as anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, and headaches. followed by the
onset of jaundice. The disease may also be characterized by increased serum
levels of the aminotransferases AST and ALT. Quantification of these enzymes in
serum indicates the extent of liver damage.There are five general categories of viral agents which have been
associated with hepatitis: the hepatitis A virus (HAV); the hepatitis B virus
(HBV); two types of non-A, non-B (NANB) agents, one blood-borne (hepatitis C)
and the other enterically transmitted (hepatitis E); and the HBV-associated delta
agent (hepatitis D).There are two general clinical categories of hepatitis, acute hepatitis
and chronic hepatitis. Symptoms for acute hepatitis range from asymptomatic and
non-apparent to fatal infections. The disease may be subclinical and persistent, or
rapidly progress to chronic liver disease with cirrhosis, and in some cases, to
hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute hepatitis B infection in adult Caucasians in the
United States progresses to chronic hepatitis B in about 5% to 10% of the cases.
In the remainder of the cases, approximately 65% are asymptomatic. In the Far
East, infection is usually perinatal, and 50% to 90% progress to the chronic state.
It is likely that the different rates of progression are linked to the age at infection
rather than genetic differences in the hosts. In the United States, about 0.2% of
the population is chronically infected, with higher percentages in high-risk groups
such as physicians, drug addicts and renal dialysis patients. In countries such as
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, the level in the population with hepatitis
infection may be as high as 10%.In the United States, about 20% of patients with chronic hepatitis
die of liver failure, and a further 5% develop hepatitis B-associated carcinoma. In 
the Far East, a large percentage of the population is infected with HBV, and after
a long chronic infection (20 to 40 years), approximately 25% of these will develop
hepatocellular carcinoma.Until recently, no therapy has proven effective for treatment of
acute or chronic hepatitis B, and patients infected with hepatitis
must generally allow the disease run its course. Most anti-viral drugs, such as
acyclovir, as well as attempts
