<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein are protecting groups for exocyclic amino groups of the bases adenine, guanine and cytosine for use in the synthesis of oligonucleotides, the protecting groups being represented by the formula: -CO-(CH2)0-9-CH3. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the base cytosine is protected with acetyl (-CO-CH3), and the oligonucleotide incorporating said protected cytosine is subjected to a cleavage/deprotection reagent comprising at least one straight chain alkylamine having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to EP-A-0 639 200,
entitled "Methods and Reagents for Cleaving
and Deprotecting Oligonucleotides" by Paraheswara Meda
Reddy and Naeem Botros Hanna.The present invention is generally directed to
the synthesis of nucleic acids and in particular to
protecting groups useful in the synthesis of nucleic
acids.Deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA") and ribonucleic
acid ("RNA") are long, threadlike macromolecules, DNA
comprising a chain of deoxyribonucleotides, and RNA
comprising a chain of ribonucleotides. A nucleotide
consists of a nucleoside and one or more phosphate
groups; a nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base
linked to a pentose sugar. Typically, the phosphate
group is attached to the fifth-carbon ("C-5") hydroxyl
group ("OH") of the pentose sugar; however, it can also
be attached to the third-carbon hydroxyl group ("C-3 
OH"). In a molecule of DNA, the pentose sugar is
deoxyribose, while in a molecule of RNA, the pentose
sugar is ribose. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are
adenine ("A"), cytosine ("C"), guanine ("G") and thymine
("T"). These bases are the same for RNA, except that
uracil ("U") replaces thymine. Accordingly, the major
nucleosides of DNA, collectively referred to as
"deoxynucleosides", are as follows: deoxyadenosine
("dA"); deoxycytidine ("dC"); deoxyguanosine ("dG"); and
thymidine ("T"). The corresponding ribonucleosides are
designated "A"; "C"; "G"; and "U". (By convention, and
because there is no corresponding thymidine
ribonucleoside, deoxythymidine is typically designated as
"T"; for consistency purposes, however, thymidine will be
designated as "dT" throughout this disclosure).The sequence of the nitrogenous bases of the
DNA and RNA molecule encodes the genetic information
contained in the molecule. The sugar and phosphate
groups of a DNA or RNA molecule perform a structural
role, forming the backbone of the molecule.
Specifically, the sugar moiety of each nucleotide is
linked to the sugar moiety of the adjacent nucleotide
such that the 3'-hydroxyl of the pentose sugar of one
nucleotide is linked to the 5'-hydroxyl of the pentose
sugar of the adjacent nucleotide. The linkage between
the two pentose sugars is typically via a phosphodiester
bond. Based upon this linkage protocol, one end
("terminus") of the nucleotide chain has a 5'-terminus
(e.g. hydroxyl, triphosphate, etc.), and the other end
has a 3'-hydroxyl group. By convention, the base
sequence of a nucleotide chain is written in a 5' to 3'
direction, i.e., 5'-ATCG-3', or, simply ATCG. While DNA and RNA
