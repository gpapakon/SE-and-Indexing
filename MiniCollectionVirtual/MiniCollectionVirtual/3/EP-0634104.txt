<ABSTRACT>
The method comprises the treatment of the dried edible bulbs, which may be whole, sliced or ground, by coating with approximately 0.5 to 4% by weight of at least one suitable food-grade fat, the subsequent heat treatment of the bulbs in a humid (wet, damp) environment, advantageously with water vapour, then, preferably, bringing the material thus coated and impregnated to ambient temperature and, if necessary, drying, preferably under vacuum, to expel the residual moisture. The bulbs thus treated absorb much less water than those which have not received this treatment and the particles of material do not adhere together. Application to the microbiological decontamination, using heat in a wet environment, of dried edible bulbs such as dried shallots, onions or garlic.

Method for the microbiological decontamination of
dried edible bulbs, notably garlic, onion or shallot

bulbs, 
characterised in that
 it comprises treating the
dried edible bulbs, whether whole, sliced or ground, by

coating or pre-mixing them with a quantity of at least one
suitable nutrient fatty body comprised between 0.5 and 4

% by weight, next heat-treating said bulbs with steam in
a humid medium, then preferably bringing to room

temperature the material thus coated and impregnated, and
if necessary drying it, preferably in a vacuum, to expel

the residual moisture.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the bulbs are whole or in a sliced or ground form, for
example slivers or granulates.
Method according to claim 2, 
characterised in that

the slivers are slices of cloves approximately 1 mm thick,
cut into approximately 7 or 8 pieces.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the fatty body or mixture of fatty
bodies is of food standard and is liquid at 50 to 55 °C.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in that

the fatty body is made up essentially of triglycerides,
i.e. triesters of glycerol and of saturated or unsaturated

fatty acids, with a C
4
 to C
24
 chain length.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in that

the fatty body is chosen from the following:

natural or hydrogenated and/or fractional vegetable
oils and fats, such as for example almond oil, groundnut

oil, safflower oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil, shea oil,
wheatgerm oil, hazelnut oil, walnut oil, olive oil, palm 

oil, cabbage palm oil, grape pip oil, sesame oil, soya
oil, sunflower oil, or mixtures thereof;
natural or hydrogenated and/or fractional animal
fats, such as for example anhydrous dairy fat, horse fat,

lard, beef suet, poultry fats, fish oils and sea-mammal
oils, or mixtures thereof.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 it comprises:

placing the material to be treated in a partial
vacuum, preferably at around -300 mbars, prior to

injecting the fatty body;
applying a pre-vacuum at -200 to -900 mbars piror
to the steam treatment; and/or
applying a more intense vacuum to dry the treated
material.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the injection of steam is carried
out until the required pasteurisation temperatures of the

material to be treated are reached, ranging from 60°C to
120°C.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the drying phase is carried out for
a duration varying between 30 and 50 minutes.
