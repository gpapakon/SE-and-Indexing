<ABSTRACT>
Folding table consisting of a tabletop (1) and a 
support (2), which tabletop is composed of two tabletop parts (5,6) 

that are connected to one another in such a manner that 
they can pivot between two extreme positions, the tabletop 

parts lying in one plane and constituting the tabletop in 
the first extreme position and the tabletop parts being 

positioned parallel to one another, their bottom sides 
facing one another, in the second extreme position, each 

tabletop part having a rim that is complementary with a 
rim of the other tabletop part and each tabletop part with 

the rim part belonging to this complementary rim being 
connected to a bridge (86,87) so that it can pivot around an axis 

parallel to the tabletop, the two axes being parallel to 
one another, the bottom side of each tabletop part being 

provided with a toothed wheel segment (80,81) near the 
complementary rim, the teeth of which toothed wheel 

segments are in mesh with one another, and the axis of 
rotation of each tabletop part coinciding with the axis of 

the toothed wheel segment. 
Each tabletop part is provided with a leg 
structure that can pivot around an axis that is 

essentially parallel to the complementary rim of the 
tabletop part and a bar being provided between the bridge 

and the leg structure, to which said bar is hinged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a folding table 
consisting of a tabletop and a support, which tabletop is 
composed of two tabletop parts that are connected to one 
another in such a manner that they can pivot between two 
extreme positions, the tabletop parts lying in one plane 
and constituting the tabletop in the first extreme 
position and the tabletop parts being positioned parallel 
to one another, their bottom sides facing one another, in 
the second extreme position, each tabletop part having a 
rim that is complementary to a rim of the other tabletop 
part and each tabletop part with the rim part belonging to 
this complementary rim being connected to a bridge so that 
it can pivot around an axis parallel to the tabletop, the 
two axes being parallel to one another. Such a table is known from DE-A-3,943,398. In 
practice it has proved to be rather laborious and 
difficult for one person to set up such tables. One of the 
causes of this is that the two tabletop parts can move 
independently of one another. Furthermore the leg 
structures have to be moved simultaneously, too. These 
factors make the whole difficult to use. The aim of the invention is to provide a table 
of the type described in the preamble with which the 
aforementioned drawbacks are avoided. This aim is achieved according to the invention 
in that the bottom side of each tabletop part is fitted 
with a toothed wheel segment near the complementary rim, 
the teeth of these toothed wheel segments being in mesh 
with one another and the axis of rotation of each tabletop 
part coinciding with the axis of the toothed wheel 
segment.  
 The coupling of the two tabletop parts by means 
of a toothed wheel mechanism makes it substantially easier 
to open out and fold up the table because it suffices to 
move one tabletop part relative to the leg structure: the 
kinematic coupling ensures the automatic and correct 
moving of the other tabletop part. With a table with which each tabletop part is 
fitted with a leg structure that can pivot around an axis 
that is substantially parallel to the complementary rim of 
the tabletop part a bar is preferably provided between the 
bridge and the leg structure, to which said bar is hinged. This ensures that the movement of the leg 
structure is also kinematically coupled to that of the 
tabletop parts, which makes the whole even more 
manageable. Further modifications of the folding table of claim 1 are defined in the other dependent claims Other characteristics and advantages will become 
clear from the

<CLAIMS>
Folding table consisting of a tabletop (1) and a support (2), 
which tabletop (1) is composed of two tabletop parts (5, 6) that 

are connected to one another in such a manner that 
they can pivot between two extreme positions, the 

tabletop parts lying in one plane and constituting 
the tabletop in the first extreme position and the 

tabletop parts being positioned parallel to one 
another, their bottom sides facing one another, in 

the second extreme position, each tabletop part 
having a rim (19, 21) that is complementary with a rim of the 

other tabletop part and each tabletop part and the 
rim part belonging to this complementary rim being 

connected to a bridge (86, 87) so that it can pivot around an 
axis parallel to the tabletop, the two axes being 

parallel to one another, characterised in that the 
bottom side of each tabletop part is provided with a 

toothed wheel segment (80, 81) near the complementary rim, the 
teeth of this toothed wheel segment being in mesh 

with one another, and the axis of rotation of each 
tabletop part coinciding with the axis of the toothed 

wheel segment. 
Table according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
bottom side of each tabletop part (5, 6) is provided with 

several toothed wheel parts (80, 81) whose axes coincide with 
the axis of rotation of the tabletop part. 
Table according to any one of the above claims, each 
tabletop part (5, 6) being provided with a leg structure (7, 8) 

that can pivot around an axis that is substantially 
parallel to the complementary rim of the tabletop 

part, a bar (92, 93) being provided between 
the bridge and the leg structure (7, 8), to which said bar 

(92, 93) is hinged.  
 
Folding table according to claim 3, characterised in that each leg 
structure (7, 8) comprises two leg parts (9, 10, 11, 12) that are connected 

to one another via a hinge whose axis of rotation in 
the normal position of the leg structure (7, 8) is 

perpendicular to the plane of the tabletop, each leg 
part being capable of moving between two extreme 

positions, a first extreme position in which the leg 
parts and the appurtenant hinge lie in one plane, and 

a second extreme position in which the leg parts, 
viewed in the direction perpendicular to the plane of 

the tabletop, are at an angle, the ends of the leg 
parts furthest removed from the pivot relative to the 

centre of the tabletop being further removed than in 
the first position. 
Table according to claim 4, characterised in that a 
leg part can be locked in the second position against 

a movement of the leg structure of which the leg part 
forms part. 
Table according to claim 4 or claim 5, characterised 
in that each leg part can be locked in the second 

position against a movement around the axis 
perpendicular to the plane of the tabletop part. 
Table according to any one of the above claims, 
characterised that two tabletop parts placed against 

one another can be locked relative to one another. 
Table according to any one of the above claims, 
characterised in that the rims of the tabletop parts 

adjoining one another in the first position are each 
provided with at least one tubular recession, which 

recessions lie in line with one another in the first 
position of the tabletop parts, and that one of these 

tubular recesses incorporates a reinforcing bar, in a 
manner allowing movement, which bar can be 

incorporated in its entirety in one of the recesses.
