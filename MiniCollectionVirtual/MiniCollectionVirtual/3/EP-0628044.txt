<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intermediates useful in the preparation of purine
nucleoside analogues containing a carbocyclic ring in place of the sugar residue.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA containing virus which infects humans. It is a member
of the class of closely related viruses known as the hepadnaviruses, each member of which
selectively infects either mammalian or avian hosts, such as the woodchuck and the duck.Worldwide, HBV is a viral pathogen of major consequence. It is most common in Asian
countries, and prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The virus is etiologically associated with
primary hepatocellular carcinoma and is thought to cause 80% of the world's liver cancer.
In the United States more than ten thousand people are hospitalized for HBV illness each
year, an average of 250 die with fulminant disease.The United States currently contains an estimated pool of 500,000-1 million infectious
carriers. Chronic active hepatitis will develop in over 25% of carriers, and often progresses
to cirrhosis. It is estimated that 5000 people die from HBV-related cirrhosis each year in the
USA, and that perhaps 1000 die from HBV-related liver cancer. Even when a universal HBV
vaccine is in place, the need for effective anti-HBV compounds will continue. The large
reservoir of persistently infected carriers, estimated at 220 million worldwide, will receive no
benefit from vaccination and will continue at high risk for HBV-induced liver disease. This
carrier population serves as the source of infection of susceptible individuals perpetuating
the instance of disease particularly in endemic areas or high risk groups such as IV drug
abusers and homosexuals. Thus, there is a great need for effective antiviral agents, both to
control the chronic infection and reduce progression to hepatocellular carcinoma.Clinical effects of infection with HBV range from headache, fever, malaise, nausea,
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pains. Replication of the virus is usually controlled by the
immune response, with a course of recovery lasting weeks or months in humans, but
infection may be more severe leading to persistent chronic liver disease as outlined above.
In "Viral Infections of Humans" (second edition, Ed., Evans, A.S. (1982) Plenum Publishing
Corporation, New York), Chapter 12 describes in detail the etiology of viral hepatitis
infections. Of the DNA viruses, the herpes group is the source of many common viral illnesses in man.
The group includes cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella
