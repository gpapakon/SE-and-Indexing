<ABSTRACT>
Assemblies for electronic components, especially for motor vehicle electronics, have to satisfy increasingly stringent requirements with respect to quality and, in particular, cost efficiency. These requirements are satisfied by the assembly according to the invention, whose electronic components are arranged on a printed circuit board which, for its part, is firmly connected to a metal plate. The printed circuit board and the components are completely extrusion-coated (moulded) by means of a suitable plastic material, so that extrusion-coating on the circumference of the printed circuit board forms a positively locking connection with the metal plate and thus forms a moisture-tight housing for the printed circuit board and the components. Further advantages include significant material savings as well as a production depth which is less than that of known assemblies and as a result of which the required cost efficiency is achieved.

<CLAIMS>
An electrical assembly with a printed circuit board (2) 
bearing electronic components (3, 3a) and with a metal plate 

(1) having a first and second surface (1a, 1b), where the 
printed circuit board (2) is arranged interlockingly on the 

first surface (la) of the metal plate (10, characterised by 
the following features: 


a) the metal plate (1) has a surface such that it projects 

at the periphery of the printed circuit board (2) and 
b) an extrusion-coating of the components (3, 3a) and of 
the printed circuit board (2) by means of a moulding 

compound is provided, where this extrusion-coating forms 
an interlocking connection with that part of the metal 

plate (1) projecting at the periphery of the printed 
circuit board (2). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the metal plate (1) projects at the 

periphery of the extrusion-coating (5). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 with a 
plug which is connected to the printed circuit board and 

which is constructed from a plug core and a plug housing, 
characterised in that the plug housing is designed as 

extrusion-coating (6b) of the plug core (6a) and this 
extrusion-coating forms one single extrusion-coating together 

with the extrusion-coatings of the components (3, 3a) and of 
the printed circuit board (2). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 3,
 
characterised in that the plug (6a, 6b) is arranged on the 

second surface (1b) of the metal plate (1). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, where 
means are provided for the connection of connecting leads,
  
 

characterised in that a multiple edge connector (8) is used 
for the connection of the connecting leads. 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 5,
 
characterised in that for the application of the multiple 

edge connector plug (8) the metal plate (1) is provided in 
its peripheral region with a recess (7), the depth of which 

recess is such that a peripheral region of the printed 
circuit board (2) adequate to accommodate the multiple edge 

connector (8) projects into this recess (7) and that this 
peripheral region of the printed circuit board (2) is not 

extrusion-coated. 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 6,
 
characterised in that on the second surface (1b) of the metal 

plate (1) in the peripheral region of the printed circuit 
board (2) an extrusion-coating (5b) of the contact zone of 

metal plate (1) and printed circuit board (2) is provided, 
which extrusion-coating (5b) forms one single extrusion-coating 

with the extrusion-coatings of the components (3, 3a) 
and of the printed circuit board (2). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in Claim 7,
 
characterised in that a guide frame (5c) for the multiple 

edge connector (8) is formed with the extrusion-coating (5a, 
5b). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in one of Claims 5 to 
8, characterised in that a zero-force plug is used as 

multiple edge connector (8). 
An electronic assembly as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that housing-free 

semiconductor chips are used as electronic components (3, 
3a).  

 
An electronic assembly as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a multi-layer board 

is used as printed circuit board (1).
