<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention there is provided a method
for preparing a silver salt diffusion transfer imaging element

comprising the steps of coating in the order given on a grained and
anodized side of an aluminum support (i) an image receiving layer

containing physical development nuclei, (ii) a photosensitive layer
containing a silver halide emulsion in water permeable relationship

with said image receiving layer and (iii) optionally an antistress
layer in water permeable relationship with said image receiving

layer, characterized in that said aluminum support, provided with
said image receiving layer, is kept at a relative humidity of at

least 45 % in an area of a machine, the said area being ahead of a
coating head used for coating said photosensitive layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a
silver salt diffusion transfer imaging element for making a printing
plate.More specifically the invention is related to a method for
preparing a silver salt diffusion transfer imaging element for
making a printing plate with improved lithographic properties.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer
reversal process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been
described e.g. in US-P- 2 352 014 and in the book "Photographic
Silver Halide Diffusion Processes" by Andr√© Rott and Edith Weyde -
The Focal Press - London and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values ("DTR-image")
with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the water-repellent
ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive ink-repellent
background.The DTR-image can be formed in the image receiving layer of a
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called two-sheet
DTR element) or in the image receiving layer of a so-called
single-support-element, also called mono-sheet element, which
contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
integral with an image receiving layer in waterpermeable
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which
is preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the
DTR method.Two main types of mono-sheet DTR materials that are distinct
because of their different layer arrangement and processing are
known. The first type of mono-sheet DTR material comprises on a
support, generally paper or a resin support such as polyester, in
the order given a silver halide emulsion layer and an image
receiving layer containing physical development nuclei as a surface
layer. After information-wise exposure and development according to
the DTR process a silver image is formed in the surface layer.
Since the underlying layers are hydrophilic in nature and the silver
image
