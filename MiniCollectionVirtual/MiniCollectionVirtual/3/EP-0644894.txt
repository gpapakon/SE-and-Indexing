<ABSTRACT>
The cytotoxic T cell response to the protein encoded by the NS5 region of hepatitis C virus was determined using 28 peptides from NS5 which were selected by an amphipathicity algorithm as candidates for T cell epitopes. In BALB/c mice, a single relatively conserved epitope represented by a 16-residue synthetic peptide was presented by D

 CTL. An exemplary peptide, which represents amino acid residues 2422-2437 of the polyprotein of the Chiron HCV1 isolate, had the amino acid sequence MSYSWTGALVTPCAAE {SEQ ID NO: 1}. A CTL line specific for this peptide recognized the two known natural variants of this NS5 sequence, each with conservative substitutions. Thus, CTL can recognize the product of the HCV NS5 gene, the probable RNA polymerase, in association with class I MHC molecules on model target cells and may recognize the same epitope on hepatocytes or any other cells infected with the virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the recently recognized 
causative agent of parenterally transmitted non-A, non-B 
(NANB) hepatitis. The RNA genome of the virus has been 
molecularly cloned from the plasma of an experimentally 
infected chimpanzee (see document number 8 in the list of 
numbered documents at the end of the specification). 
Analysis of the sequence of the genome revealed that it 
is a single-stranded, plus sense RNA of approximately 
9500 nucleotides in length. A single long open reading 
frame of 9033 nucleotides was found, coding for a 
polyprotein of 3011 amino acid residues. These genomic 
features and sequence comparisons, combined with 
knowledge about the size and lability to lipid solvents, 
indicated that the virus is probably a member of the 
Flavivirus family (6,22). However, it may be more 
closely related to the pestivirus genus than classic 
flaviviruses (27,60). Based on sequence similarities of both the genome 
and the predicted polyprotein, as well as on certain 
features of the polyprotein such as hydrophobicity 
profiles and acidic/basic amino acid content, it is 
predicted that proteins of HCV are encoded in the same 
general regions of the genome as has been determined for 
the flaviviruses. In the flaviviruses and the related 
pestiviruses, approximately the amino-terminal one third 
of the polyprotein constitutes the structural proteins of 
the virus. These consist of a highly basic nucleocapsid 
protein termed "C," an envelope-associated glycoprotein 
termed "M" and a second envelope glycoprotein "E." The 
non-structural proteins are named NS1 through NS5, but 
the functions of only NS3 and NS5 have been assigned with 
certainty. NS3 is the viral protease and probably a 
helicase, and NS5 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase.  
 The HCV polyprotein is processed in a series of 
proteolytic digestions by a combination of the viral 
protease and host signalase. The processing of the 
pestivirus polyprotein is different in detail from that 
of the flaviviruses, but is similar in its general 
scheme. The proteins of HCV have been determined largely 
by analogy with the flavivirus proteins, and, like the 
pestiviruses, they may also differ in details of size, 
number, and processing from the flaviviruses. With these 
caveats, for convenience of nomenclature but not to imply 
identity in function or processing, hereafter the 
nonstructural region under study that is analogous to the 
flavivirus NS5 region RNA polymerase is referred to as 
the "NS5 region" or "NS5
