<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
peritoneal dialysis. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to manufacturing and storing 
bicarbonate peritoneal dialysis solutions. The use of dialysis to support a patient whose 
renal function has decreased to the point where the 
kidneys no longer sufficiently function is known. Two 
principal dialysis methods are utilized: hemodialysis; 
and peritoneal dialysis. In hemodialysis, the patient's blood is passed 
through an artificial kidney dialysis machine. A 
membrane in the machine acts as an artificial kidney for 
cleansing the blood. Because it is an extracorporeal 
treatment that requires special machinery, certain 
inherent disadvantages are present with hemodialysis. To overcome the disadvantages associated with 
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis was developed. 
Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's own peritoneum 
as a semipermeable membrane. The peritoneum is the 
membranous lining of the body cavity that due to the 
large number of blood vessels and capillaries is capable 
of acting as a natural semipermeable membrane. In peritoneal dialysis, a dialysis solution is 
introduced into the peritoneal cavity utilizing a 
catheter. After a sufficient period of time, an exchange 
of solutes between the dialysate and the blood is 
achieved. Fluid removal is achieved by providing a 
suitable osmotic gradient from the blood to the dialysate  
 
to permit water outflow from the blood. This allows a 
proper acid-base, electrolyte and fluid balance to be 
returned to the blood. The dialysis solution is simply 
drained from the body cavity through the catheter. Besides the removal of metabolism products, one of 
the most important problems of every kidney replacement 
therapy, such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, 
lies in the correction of metabolic acidosis. For this 
reason, the dialysis solutions used in each of these 
processes contain a buffer. Three common buffers often used in dialysis 
solutions are bicarbonate, lactate, and acetate. While 
initially bicarbonate was the primary buffer used in 
dialysis solutions, over time lactate and acetate were 
substituted for bicarbonate. This was due to the 
difficulty in preparation and storage of bicarbonate-buffered 
dialysis solutions. Lactate and acetate buffers 
were found to provide greater stability in use over the 
previous bicarbonate-buffered solutions. See European 
Patent Application 90109963.0 (EP-A-0399549). However, since bicarbonate ions provide advantages 
over acetate or
