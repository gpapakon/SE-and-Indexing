<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes a new class of antigen binding molecules which contain Fv-fragments of an antibody but do not use the constant antibody domains. They can also dimerize with other antibody fragment molecules or with non-antibody fragment molecules to form bi- or multifunctional antibody-fragment fusion proteins and so-called miniantibodies, respectively. The new fusion proteins can be used in the broad field of diagnostic and therapeutical medicine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes a new class of antigen binding 
molecules which contain Fv-fragments of an antibody but 
do not use the constant antibody domains. They can also 
dimerize with other antibody fragment molecules or with 
non-antibody fragment molecules to form bi- or multifunctional 
antibody-fragment fusion proteins and so-called mininantibodies, 
respectively. The new fusion proteins can be used 
in the broad field of diagnostic and therapeutical medicine. Since a few years there is a great interest in the biotechnological 
field to modify naturally occuring antibodies in 
order to obtain more specified and more individual antibody 
species. Therefore, attempts have been made to produce (modified) 
antibody fragments. All naturally occuring antibodies of all classes have at 
least two binding sites. This enables them to bind to a 
surface with a greater functional affinity (also called 
avidity) than monovalent fragments, such as Fab fragments. 
Over the last few years, methods have been described 
(Skerra and Pl√ºckthun, 1988, Science 240, 1038-1040 ; Better 
et al., 1988, Science 240, 1041-1043) with which  
 
functional antibody fragments can be produced in Escherichia 
coli. These include the Fv fragment (the heterodimer 
consisting of VH and VL) and the Fab fragment (consisting 
of the complete light chain with the domains VL 
and CL as well as the first two domains of the heavy 
chains VH and CH1). The Fv fragment, however, has a tendency to dissociate into VH 
and VL and therefore, it is advantageous to link the two 
domains covalently. One particular way of linking them is by 
designing a peptide linker between them, either in the orientation 
VH-linker-VL or VL-linker-VH (Bird et al.,1988, Science 
242, 423; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 
5879) The resulting fragments are called single-chain Fv 
fragments. All these fragments are, however, monovalent. We describe in 
this invention a method to engineer small dimerization 
domains based on peptides forming amphipathic helices. These 
peptides will be referred to as "intercalating", but this 
term is only meant to express the ability of targeted 
association and not a restriction referring to a particular 
structure of the dimerization interface. While the methodology described here, is in principle applicable 
to either Fab, Fv or scFv fragments, it is the latter 
for which their use is most advantageous. In this case bivalent 
fragments can be constructed cf very small size, and 
still the dissociation into
