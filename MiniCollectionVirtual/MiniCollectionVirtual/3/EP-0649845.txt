<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
(tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methylamine derivatives,
insecticides containing the derivatives as an effective
ingredient and intermediates thereof.Heretofore, a lot of amine compounds having a
nitromethylene group, a nitroimino group or a cyanoimino
group have been known (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.
070468/1989, 171/1990, 157308/1991 and 154741/1992, and
others). In these publications, there is a description
that the amine compounds which contain a heterocyclic
group in their molecule show an insecticidal activity.
However, when the present inventors synthesized these
compounds and examined their insecticidal activity, it
was found that not all of the amine derivatives having a
heterocyclic group showed insecticidal activity. In
other words, compounds showing a noticeable activity
among the compounds described in these publications are
limited to the amine derivatives having a thiazolylmethyl 
or pyridylmethyl group as the heterocyclic group, and
this fact is described in J. Pesticide Sci. 18 41 (1993)
and others. Further, the compounds which are planned to
commercialize at present are only the derivatives having
a pyridylmethyl group as the heterocyclic group. EP-A-0 192 060 discloses nitroimino- and/or nitroethylene imidazolidines
having insecticidal activity. Amongst others, nitroethylene
imidazolidine derivatives are disclosed possessing
tetrahaydrofuranyl rings as heterocyclic ring. Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide amine derivatives having a nitromethylene
group, a nitroimino group or a cyanoimino
group, which are low-toxic and show excellent
insecticidal activity without having the above-mentioned
pyridylmethyl group or thiazolylmethyl group as the
heterocyclic group.The present inventors earnestly investigated so
as to solve the above-mentioned problems and, as a
result, have found that novel (tetrahydro-3-furanyl)-methylamine
derivatives of the formula (1) have an
excellent insecticidal activity even in the absence of a
pyridylmethyl group or a thiazolylmethyl group in their
molecular structure. On the basis of the finding, they
have completed the present invention.According to the present invention, there are
provided (tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methylamine derivatives
represented by a formula (1): 

where X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6 and X7 represent each a
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon
atoms; R1 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group
having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having
3 carbon atoms, a
