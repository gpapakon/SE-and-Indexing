<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a lubricating oil composition for 
refrigeration machine comprising 100 parts by weight of a 

carboxylic ester having a number-average molecular weight 
(Mn) of 200 to 5,000 and a kinematic viscosity at 100 °C of 

2 to 100 cSt or a carbonic ester having a number-average 
molecular weight (Mn) of 200 to 5,000 and a kinematic 

viscosity at 100 °C of 2 to 100 cSt, and 0.001 to 15 parts 
by weight of a fluoroalkyl group-containing alcohol. The 

lubricating oil composition for refrigeration machine can 
extremely reduce the amount of metal abrasion at the slide 

part of the compression type refrigeration machine in which 
hydrogenated fluorocarbon (HFC) such as R-134a is used as a 

refrigerant. This composition can be also used for 
refrigeration machines of other types than the compression 

type because of its excellent lubricating properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil 
composition for refrigeration machines, and more 
particularly to a lubricating oil composition which is used 
for compression type refrigeration machines of automotive 
air-conditioners, electric refrigerators and room air 
conditioners, wherein hydrogenated fluorocarbon (HFC) is 
used as a refrigerant. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) such as R-12 (CCl₂F₂) or 
hydrogenated chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) such as R-22 
(CHClF₂) have been heretofore used as refrigerants for 
compression type refrigeration machines used in automotive 
air-conditioners, electric refrigerators for domestic use, 
room air-conditioners, etc., but recently, these 
refrigerants, which contain chlorine, can be hardly used 
for those purposes from the viewpoint of prevention of 
ozone layer destruction. Now, hydrogenated fluorocarbons (HFC) such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(R-134a) have been developed as ozone 
layer-nondestructive refrigerants. Examples of lubricating 
oils for refrigeration machines developed as the HFC 
include polyalkylene glycol and derivatives thereof,  
 
carboxylic ester derivatives and carbonic ester 
derivatives. Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 12497/1991 
describes that a lubricating oil composition comprising a 
fluoroalkyl group-containing alcohol represented by the 
following formula and a polyether compound shows good 
compatibility with HFC and is excellent in anti-burning 
properties.

Rf-R¹-OH


 
wherein R¹ is an alkylene group of 2 to 15 carbon atoms, Rf 
is a fluoroalkyl group of 5 to 16 carbon atoms, the number 
of fluorine atoms in the Rf group is at least 2n-3 (n is 
the number of carbon atoms in the Rf group), and at least 
one fluorine atom is bonded to each carbon atom in the Rf 
group. With regard to the compression type refrigeration 
machines for automotive air-conditioners, electric 
refrigerators for domestic use, etc., there has been 
recently proposed a novel refrigerating system as an ozone 
layer-nondestructive system, that is, a refrigerating 
apparatus system in which HFC such as R-134a is used as a 
refrigerant, a lubricating oil comprising polyalkylene 
glycol or its derivative, a carboxylic ester derivative, a 
carbonic ester derivative or the like is used, and the 
refrigerating apparatus is made of a material suitable for 
the lubricating oil. However, this novel system involves such problems that 
when repeated endurance tests are conducted, the amount of  
 
metal abrasion is large at the slide part of the 
compressio
