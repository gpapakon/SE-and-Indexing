<ABSTRACT>
A building panel (10, 85) having a core (13, 85) between facing sheets (11, 12, 88, 89) with parallel channels through the core (13, 85) which are used for structural framework (23, 26) of the building. Either of framing such as timber and steel, or concrete (87) can be interacted with the channels in construction of a building. The panels can be used as formwork for floors (131), ceilings, roofs and walls (102, 103, 109, 118) using concrete as the structural element.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to building panels,
buildings and building systems using the panels. In
particular, the invention relates to a cored or channelled
panel and system which utilise the cored or channelled
character of the panel to erect buildings and the like.Many factory formed panels are used in the
building industry by which to form a wall, roof, etc. in a
building. Systems employing modular units that are
prefabricated to enable creation of a range of
architecturally varied buildings are known. With all such
panels and systems, effort is put into seeking to reduce
input material costs, to improve fabrication techniques so
as to reduce production costs, and to adapt the
characteristics of the prefabricated elements to reduce onsite
handling problems and make erection of buildings less
dependent on skilled trades.FR-A-2239571 and EP-A-0074908 disclose
building panels of sandwich construction, having a thick
core sheet between two thinner facing sheets. Bores formed
in the thickness of the core sheet can receive
reinforcements. At an edge region the core sheet may be
shaped to define a cavity for use in connecting panels.According to the present invention there is
provided a building panel for use in the construction of
floors, walls, roofs and ceilings of buildings comprising:
spaced apart first and second facing sheets
anda core therebetween which is substantially
coextensive with the facing sheets;the first and second sheets being bonded to
the core; 
   characterised in that the core is composed
of an array of elongate members which are spaced apart to
create voids or channels between them, said voids or
channels being dimensioned to pass therethrough or receive
therein structural building elements or concrete;
   and wherein the end members of the array are
spaced inwardly from the ends of the facing sheets, thus
defining open-mouthed channels.In addition to the above defined panel, the
invention provides novel building structures utilising the
panel as will be described hereinafter.Further , the invention also provides novel
methods of establishing buildings utilising the above
described panels which will also be described in greater
detail hereinafter.The facing sheets above might be fibre
cement sheets, plasterboard sheets, plywood, and the like,
with or without surface treatments suited to the use of
the panel. The facing sheets may be chosen for their
structural characteristics when a stressed skin effect is
desired in the panel. The thickness of the facing sheets
will depend on the use
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A building panel (148) for use in the
construction of floors, walls, roofs and ceilings of

buildings comprising:

spaced apart first and second facing sheets
(149, 150)

and
a core (151, 152, 153) therebetween which is
substantially coextensive with the facing sheets (149,

150) ;
the first and second sheets (149, 150) being
bonded to the core (151, 152, 153);

   
characterised in that
 the core is composed
of an array of elongate members (152) which are spaced

apart to create voids or channels (153) between them, said
voids or channels being dimensioned to pass therethrough or

receive therein structural building elements or concrete;

   and wherein the end members (152) of the
array are spaced inwardly from the ends of the facing

sheets (149, 150), thus defining open-mouthed channels
(155).
A building panel according to claim 1 wherein the
core includes a layer (151) located between a facing

sheet (150) and the elongated members which are block form elements (152).
A building panel according to claim 2 wherein said
layer (151) is a layer of heat insulating material.
A building panel according to any preceding claim
wherein said elongate members are block form elements (152) made of foam. 
A building panel as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 5 wherein:

   the material of the facing sheets is chosen
to provide the panel with the structural characteristics

of a stressed skin in use.
A building comprising a plurality of panels
joined edge-to-edge or edge-to-face wherein the panels

are according to any preceding claim ; and wherein

   the panels are joined with elongate
structural framing elements passed therethrough,

integrally connected at each end with building framing.
A building as claimed in Claim 6 wherein:

   said panels are joined edge-to-edge,
or edge-to-face, with concrete flowed through channels

within the panels to be integrated with building framing
at panel edges.
A building as claimed in Claim 6 wherein:

   an edge-to-edge connection of adjoining
panels has been effected by insertion of an elongate element

placed within open edges of adjoining panels, the core
being recessed at each adjoining panel edge between

respective facing sheets to create a void to accommodate
the elongate element therein, and the panels being

attached to the enclosed elongate element at the edge-to-edge
connection.
A building as claimed in Claim 6 wherein:
 
   an edge-to-face connection of adjoining

panels has been effected by insertion of an inner elongate
element through a channel of a first panel with an outer

elongate element laid up against the face of the first
panel which is to be joined to the edge of a second

panel and attached to the inner elongate element, an
edge of the second panel being fitted over the outer

elongate element, its core being recessed at the edge
for this purpose and the second panel being attached to

the outer elongate element.
A method of producing a building of the type claimed in Claim 7 wherein:

   an edge-to-face connection of adjoining
panels is effected by breaking open a channel of a first

panel by opening its facing sheet at points along the
channel, butting an edge of a second panel thereagainst,

the second panel having a recessed core at its edge to
define a void communicated with the first panel channel,

and concrete being flowed therein to set and
interconnect the two panels.
A method of constructing a building of the
type claimed in any one of Claims 6 to 9 wherein:

   the panels are wall panels and the core of
the panels is recessed at their upper edge to define a

continuous channel across the top of adjoining panels, in which
a structural beam is established, or through

which building services such as plumbing and electrical
wiring are passed.
A method of constructing a building as claimed
in Claim 11 wherein:

   the structural beam is timber.
A method of constructing a building as claimed
in Claim 11 wherein:

   the beam is concrete flowed into the
channel.
A method of constructing a building as claimed 
in Claim 11 wherein:

   a bottom plate is put in place, a first
vertical stud is connected thereto, a first panel with

recesses on all edges is stood thereover and attached to
the bottom plate and first vertical stud at its bottom

and a first edge, a second vertical stud is attached to
the bottom plate engaged with a second edge of the first

panel and second and subsequent panels are added by
repetition of the process with, on completion, addition

of a top plate over the top edges attached to the studs.
A method of constructing a building as claimed
in Claim 11 wherein:

   a plurality of panels with recessed edges on
all edges are arrayed edge-to-edge standing over a

bottom plate and the enclosed volumes at adjoined edges
are filled with concrete to the top with a reinforced

beam formed through the recessed top edges.
