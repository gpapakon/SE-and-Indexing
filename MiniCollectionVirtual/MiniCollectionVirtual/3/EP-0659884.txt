<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrot 16 kD protein, and more particularly, 
it relates to a protein corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 16 kD, which 
can be specifically expressed in carrot roots. The present invention further relates to a gene 
coding for said protein and a plasmid containing said gene. It is well known that reserve proteins are present in the subterranean storage 
tissue of sweet potatoes, white potatoes and the like. By contrast, the presence of reserve 
proteins has not yet been found in the subterranean tissue of root vegetables which are 
crops having edible roots such as carrots. Carrot roots have been used as a root vegetable for food; it has, however, 
been found that they contain only small amounts of proteins essential to the maintenance 
of health. Thus, it has been desired that high-protein carrots are developed by higher 
expression of proteins which are present in small amounts but specifically in the carrot 
roots. For this purpose, it has been necessary to find, first of all, proteins which can be 
specifically expressed in carrot roots and genes coding for these proteins. Under these circumstances, the present inventors have intensively studied. 
As a result, they have found a soluble protein which can be specifically expressed in 
carrot roots, and succeeded in the cloning of cDNA coding for said protein. Further, 
they have determined the amino acid sequence of said protein by analyzing the base 
sequence of said cDNA, thereby completing the present invention. Thus, the present invention provides: a protein corresponding to a molecular 
weight of approximately 16 kD, which can be specifically expressed in carrot roots, and 
having the amino acid sequence as shown in Sequence Listing, SEQ ID NO: 1; a gene  
 
containing a coding region for the amino acid sequence of said protein; and a plasmid 
containing said gene. Figure 1 shows the results of the SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (with 
silver staining) which was performed with all the proteins present in carrot roots as a 
sample. Lane M is corresponding to a molecular weight marker; and lane 1, the sample. 
The arrow indicates the band corresponding to the protein of the present invention. Figure 2 shows the N-terminal amino acid sequence (one-character representation) 
of the protein of the present invention. This sequence is corresponding to the 
amino acids at the 2nd to the 36th positions in the amino acid sequence as shown in 
Sequence Listing, SEQ ID NO: 1. Figure 3 shows the
