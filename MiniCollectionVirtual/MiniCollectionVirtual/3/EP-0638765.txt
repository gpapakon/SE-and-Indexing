<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to ultraviolet
(UV) curable coating compositions and their use as basecoats
on metallized molded plastic articles such as lamp reflectors.As further background, metallized plastic molded articles
are multi-layer structures which include a molded substrate,
a basecoat on the substrate, and a metal film adhered to the
basecoat. Further, metallized plastic molded articles may
include one or more additional coatings on top of the metal
film, for example, they may simply include a topcoat or may
include an interlayer and a topcoat.The basecoat is a highly important component of
metallized molded plastic articles. The basecoat must adhere
well to the plastic substrate and to the metal film.
Additionally, the basecoat must be of a uniform thickness
across the coated area of the substrate in order to provide a
smooth, lusterous appearance to the metallized article and,
in the case of metallized articles having exacting optical
standards, e.g. reflectors, to preserve the intended optics
of the final device. A problem which has been encountered in
the prior art is that basecoats have not possessed good
edge-coating or leveling properties. Rather, basecoats used
in the past have tended to draw or creep away from edges of
the substrate thus leaving only a thin coating or no coating
near the substrate edges, or have tended to gather at edges
and cure to form an undesired ridge or raised portion. In
the case of automobile lamp reflectors, this problem has
hampered the production of quality, substantially
smooth-surfaced reflectors which are used in conjunction with 
lenses which contain optical structure to achieve appropriate
distribution of light.FR 2447794 describes the use of a thermally-cured, powder coating in the
manufacture of headlights for the automobile industry.Moreover, a trend exists in the automobile industry to
eliminate optical structures from headlamp lenses and rather
build them into the associated reflectors. Such reflectors
having built-in optical structures include, for example,
fluted and/or faceted reflectors (see for instance U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,704,661 and 5,034,867). Fluted reflectors
include a plurality of convex flutes which introduce
alternating grooves and ridges or humps within the reflector
surface. Faceted reflectors have a plurality of discreet
reflective surfaces which introduce grooves and/or edges
between the discreet surfaces. Basecoats having poor
edge-coating and leveling properties present special problems
with such optical reflectors
