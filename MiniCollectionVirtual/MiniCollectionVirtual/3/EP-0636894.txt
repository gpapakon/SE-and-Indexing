<ABSTRACT>
The method is for testing the integrity of the equipotential electrical interconnection tracks (14-1,14-2) mounted on the dielectric substrate (10) with an earth plate (12). Capacitative zones (16-1,16-2) of known area are provided as well as a microcontroller (20) and a track shaped zone (18) which has the same width as the tracks to be tested. The capacitances of the capacitative zones (16-1,16-2) are measured and used to find the dielectric constant of the substrate. The capacitance of the track shaped zone (18) enables the width of the tracks to be determined. From this data the correct capacitances of the tracks to be tested may be found.
