<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stair nosing having at least two legs which are located in the form of an L with respect to one another and of which one is a fastening leg (1.1) and the other is a stair-nosing leg (2.1). At its upper free end, the stair-nosing leg (2.1) bears a bead (3.1) which projects beyond its end side (2''). A web (4.1) located essentially parallel to the fastening load (1.1; 1.2; 1.3; 1.4; 1.5) continues from the bead (3.1).

An edge protection rail for steps with at least
two limbs arranged in the form of an L in relation to

one another, one limb being a fixing limb (1.1; 1.2;
1.3) and the other an edge protection limb (2.1; 2.2;

2.3) which, in the fitted state, has an end face (3'')
extending away from the step, the top free end of the

edge protection limb (2.1; 2.2; 2.3) having a bead
(3.1; 3.2; 3.3) which projects over its end face and a

freely terminating nose web (4.1; 4.2; 4.3) continues
from the bead (3.1; 3.2; 3.3) and extends substantially

parallel to the fixing limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3),

characterised in that

the nose web (4.1; 4.2; 4.3) bears a nose-shaped
extension (5.1; 5.2; 5.3) which is bent off

substantially at a right angle and which points in the
direction of the fixing limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3).
An edge protection rail for steps according to
claim 1, characterised in that the nose web (4.1; 4.2;

4.3) extends to approximately half the width of the
fixing limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3).
An edge protection rail for steps according to
claim 1, characterised in that the nose web (4.1; 4.2;

4.3) and the fixing limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) are
substantially equally long.
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the bead

(3.1; 3.2; 3.3) has a rounding extending over at least
90Â°. 
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the edge

protection limb (2.1; 2.2; 2.3) continues beyond the
connection zone of the edge protection limb (2.1; 2.2;

2.3) and the fixing limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) so as to form
a T-configuration (end 3').
A stairs rail according to claim 1 or 5,

characterised in that the flat side of the fixing limb
(1.1; 1.2; 1.3) merges via fillets (7.1; 7.2; 7.3;

11.1; 11.2; 11.3) into a flat side of the edge
protection limb (2.1; 2.2; 2.3).
An edge protection rail for steps according to
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that adhesion-increasing

structures (8.1; 8.3; 9.1; 9.2; 10.1; 10.2)
are provided at least at one of the flat sides of the

limbs (1.1; 1.2; 1.3; 2.1; 2.2; 2.3).
An edge protection rail for steps according to
claim 7, characterised in that the edge protection limb

(2.1; 2.3) carries adhesion-increasing structures in
the form of adhesion-increasing grooves (8.1; 8.3) at

its side pointing towards the fixing limb (1.1; 1.3),
while the opposite side is smooth.
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the side of

the fixing limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) pointing towards the
nose web (4.1; 4.2; 4.3) is substantially flat while

the opposite side carries adhesion-increasing grooves
(9.1; 9.2; 9.3). 
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of the preceding claims 6 to 9, characterised in

that the grooves (8.1; 8.3; 9.1; 9.2; 9.3) have
trapezoidal or saw-tooth cross-sections which point

outwards in cross-section.
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the fixing

limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) is formed with apertures (16.2).
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the bead

(3.1; 3.2; 3.3) merges, starting from the edge
protection limb (2.1; 2.2; 2.3), into the nose web

(4.1; 4.2; 4.3) via a rounding.
An edge protection rail for steps according to any
one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the fixing

limb (1.1; 1.2; 1.3) of the edge protection limb (2.1;
2.2; 2.3), the bead (3.1, 3.2, 3.3), the nose web (4.1;

4.2; 4.3)1 the nose-shaped extension (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)
and the adhesion-increasing structures (8.1; 8.3; 10.1;

10.2) are made in one piece from ductile metal
materials such as brass or the like by the pultrusion

or extrusion process.
