<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a billing method for requesting the contents or data in a network. According to said billing method, the client or the person representing the client has a certificate for the billing method. Said certificate contains data that prove the client's identity and that facilitate establishment of a bill or statement. The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or a variant of the SSL protocol which allows display of a dialogue box is used for the client-server connection, using an SSL client certificate that contains an extension indicating that the certificate is suitable for the purpose of billing, the server transmitting the price for the required content or the data during the handshake protocol. A confirmation message that is also contained in the SSL protocol and that contains a digital signature is sent from the client to the server, said confirmation message confirming the previously transmitted price.

<CLAIMS>
Billing method for the requesting of content or data in a network, wherein a
client or a customer using the client has a certificate for the billing method, said

certificate containing verified data identifying the customer and enabling the
creation of an invoice or billing, a handshake protocol being used for the

security of the connection between the client and a server, a client certificate
being used, 
characterized in that
 an extension is set in the client certificate, said
extension indicating that the certificate is suitable for billing purposes, and 
in
that
, during the handshake protocol, the price of the requested content or data is
transmitted from the server to the client, wherein a confirmation message,

likewise included in the protocol and containing a digital signature, is
transmitted from the client to the server, the confirmation message confirming

the previously communicated price.
Billing method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the confirmation
messages and/or log files are recorded by the server and the therein contained

data are used for billing.
Billing method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
, after the paid content or data has been downloaded, the client-server
connection is cleared down.
Billing method according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 cleardown is
performed automatically by the server.
Billing method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
, prior to selection of a payable Internet page, a possibly existing client-server
connection is cleared down by the server or by an intermediate Internet

page and then there is renewed client authentication for the downloading of the
payable Internet page.
Billing method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
, prior to the signing of the confirmation message, the client is queried,
particularly by means of a dialog box, in which, by means of manual

confirmation, the indicated cost of the selected payable Internet page or selected

data can be confirmed, wherein, if the cost is confirmed, the payable content or
data is transmitted from the server to the client or, alternatively, the request

transaction is aborted.
Billing method according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the query is realized
by means of an error message of the client (e.g. certificate name check).
Billing method according to claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the handshake
protocol, an SSL protocol or a variant thereof is realized by means of a Java

applet or an Active X application which are signed in particular at their end.
Billing method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 cost details are communicated to the client by means of signed XML
(extended Markup Language) pages. 
Billing method according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the pages are signed
with the price details and/or with time details.
Billing method according to claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the signature
additionally includes a hash value of the content of the payable page.
