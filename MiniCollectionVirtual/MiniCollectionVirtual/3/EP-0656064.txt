<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is from the field of bispecific 
immunoadhesins. More specifically, this invention relates to 
the use of recombinant techniques to produce immunoadhesins 
with dual specificity and to techniques for their 
purification to homogeneity. The invention also concerns 
bispecific immunoadhesins for therapeutic or diagnostic use. Immunoadhesins are antibody-like molecules which combine 
the binding specificity of a protein such as a cell-surface 
receptor, a cell-adhesion molecule or a ligand (an 
"adhesin"), with the effector functions of immunoglobulin 
constant domains. Immunoadhesins can possess many of the 
valuable chemical and biological properties of human 
antibodies. Since immunoadhesins can be constructed from a 
human protein sequence with a desired specificity linked to 
an appropriate human immunoglobulin hinge and constant domain 
(Fc) sequence, the binding specificity of interest can be 
achieved using entirely human components. Such 
immunoadhesins are minimally immunogenic to the patient, and 
are safe for chronic or repeated use. If the two arms of the 
antibody-like immunoadhesin structure have two different 
specificities, the immunoadhesin is referred to as bispecific 
on the analogy of bispecific antibodies. Immunoadhesins reported in the literature include fusions 
of the T cell receptor* [Gascoigne et al.,Proc. Natl.Acad. 
Sci. USA 84, 2936-2940 (1987)]; CD4* [Capon et al.,Nature
