<ABSTRACT>
A novel benzimidazole derivative represented by formula (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, a process for 
the production thereof, an antiemetic containing the same as the active ingredient, and an intermediate for the production of the 

antiemetic. The derivative has a persistent 5-HTâ‚ƒ antagonism and the effects of preventing and curing vomit induced by cisplatin 
and is lowly toxic, thus being useful as an antiemetic for vomit accompanying the chemotherapy of cancer with the 

use of cisplatin or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel benzimidazole 
derivative, a process for preparing the same, an antiemetic 
agent containing the same as an active ingredient and 
an intermediate compound for preparing the same. Chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin are indispensable 
to the treatment of cancer. However, the chemotherapeutics 
cause side effects such as vomiting and hence make it 
difficult to continue the treatment. Recently, it has become known that the occurrence 
of vomiting is associated with one of receptors of serotonin 
[5-hydroxytryptamine, hereinafter referred to as "5-HT"]. 5-HT 
is one of neurotransmitters in the living body and 
receptors of 5-HT have been classified into three groups, 5-HT1, 
5-HT2 and 5-HT3. Among them, 5-HT3 receptor is associated 
with vomiting due to chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. 
That is, 5-HT is released by administration of the chemotherapeutics 
and the released 5-HT is bound to the abdominal 5-HT3 
receptor, and thereby the chemical receptor trigger in the 
bulb fourth ventricle is stimulated via the abdominal vagus  
 
nerve, and then the vomiting center is stimulated to induce 
vomiting. It has been reported that Ondansetron (GR38032F, see 
the following formula) having 5-HT3 antagonistic activity is 
effective for inhibition of vomiting caused by the administration 
of the chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin [Cancer. 
Chemother. Pharmacol., 23, 389-391 (1989)]. 
On the other hand, there has already been known the 
use of 2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)benzimidazole deriviatives as 
a drug. For example, Japanese Patent First Publication No. 
50-126682 discloses 2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)benzimidazole 
derivatives having analgesic and antiinflammatory activities, 
and 1-methyl-2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)benzimidazole (Compound 
A) etc are exemplified. However, the 5-HT3 antagonistic 
activity and the resulting antiemetic activity of 2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)benzimidazole 
derivatives have not yet been 
known (see Experiment 1 disclosed hereinafter).  
 The present inventors have conducted a variety of 
studies for developing a novel antiemetic agent having a 
strong and long-loasting inhibitory activity against vomiting 
due to chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer with cisplatin 
etc. based on the 5-HT3 antagonistic activity. The present inventors have extensively studied, and 
as a result, have found that a novel benzimidazole derivative 
of the following formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
acid addition salt thereof can satisfy the above
