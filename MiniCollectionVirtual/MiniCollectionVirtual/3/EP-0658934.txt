<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat sink for a semiconductor component (8), consisting of a finned base (2) and a plurality of spaced fins (4) which all have the same height (h). According to the invention, a side (6) facing the fins (4) is designed convexly with respect to a side (10) of the finned base (2) facing the semiconductor component (8) in such a way that, during application-specific use of this heat sink, the bottoms of its fins (4) are arranged on a surface of constant temperature. This produces a fined heat sink with which a heat flow density is achieved which has to date being achievable only using evaporation coolers or liquid coolers.

High-capacity heat sink for a semiconductor
component, which heat sink has a 
fin base (2) and a
plurality of fins (4) spaced apart on an upper surface

(6) of this fin base (2), wherein in the edge region
(B) of the fin base upper surface (6) this fin base (2)

is provided with a ridge-like convexity in such a way
that when this heat sink is used with a semiconductor

component that is to be cooled, the latter's base
surface area is smaller than the base surface area of

the fin base (2), the fin base upper surface (6) having
substantially no difference in temperature over its

surface area.
High-capacity heat sink according to claim 1,
characterised in that the fin base (2) has a square

base area and in that the ridge-like convexity (12)
forms a closed ring.
High-capacity heat sink according to claim 1,
characterised in that the fin base (2) has a

rectangular base area.
High-capacity heat sink according to claims 1
and 3, characterised in that the heat sink is an

extruded profiled section.
High-capacity heat sink according to claims 1
and 2, characterised in that a plurality of heat sinks

are connected together in a material-closing manner in
the longitudinal direction of the fins.
High-capacity heat sink according to one of
claims 1, 2, 3 or 5, characterised in that the heat

sink is a cast portion.
High-capacity heat sink according to one of
the afore-mentioned claims 1 to 6, characterised in

that all the cooling fins (4) are of the same height
(h). 
High-capacity heat sink according to one of
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the ends of all

the cooling fins (4) form a plane which is arranged so
as to be spatially parallel to a surface area (10)

which is remote from the fin base upper surface (6) of
the fin base (2).
