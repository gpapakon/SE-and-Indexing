<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an internal-combustion engine air-aspiration system which includes an enclosure (1) with an inlet pipe (6) and separate suction pipes (2 to 5) which are connected to the cylinder head and open out in the individual cylinders. The interior (A) of the enclosure is connected to a pollutant-reduction system which includes at least one of the following units: a housing-air evacuation unit, a supplementary-air supply unit, a fuel-vapour removal unit and an exhaust-gas recycling unit. Mounted on the inlet pipe (6) is an intake tube which extends into the enclosure of the air-aspiration system and which opens out at a point approximately in the plane between the two middle suction pipes (3, 4), a pipe connecting the units of the pollutant-reduction system opening out in the interior (A) of the enclosure at the same point.

<CLAIMS>
An internal-combustion engine with an intake unit, comprising a container (1) with an 
intake socket (6) and individual intake pipes (2, 3, 4, 5) connected to a cylinder head 

and opening into the individual cylinders, wherein the interior of the container (1) is 
connected to a pollutant-reduction device (
R
) comprising at least one of the units such 
as a housing-venting unit (10), an additional-air-conveying unit (11), a fuel-vapour-collecting 

unit (12) and an exhaust-gas-return unit (9), 
characterized in that
 an intake 
pipe (7) projecting into the container (1) of the intake unit is secured to the intake 

socket (6), the intake pipe (7) being provided with an opening (7a) substantially in a 
plane (
0-0
) between two middle individual intake pipes (3 and 4) surrounded respectively 
by at least one further individual intake pipe (2 and 5), and a pipe socket (8) connecting 

the units (9 to 12) of the pollutant-reduction device (
R
) opens into the interior 
(
A
) of the container (1). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pipe 
socket (8) is situated in the plane (
0-0
) which corresponds to the plane of the cross-section 
of the container extending through the centre of gravity (
SP
) of the interior 
volume of the container (1). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
opening (14) of the pipe socket (8) with the radius (
r
) is situated at a distance in the 
range of from 0.4 
r
 to 0.8 
r
 from the centre of gravity (
SP
) of the volume of the container. 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
opening (14) ofthe pipe socket (8) is situated in the plane (
0-0
) of the centre of gravity 
(
SP
) of the interior volume of the container (1). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 

characterized in that
 the opening (14) of the pipe socket (8) of the pollutant-reduction 
device (
R
) is situated in the longitudinal median axis (
X-X
) of the pipe (7). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 one end of 
the pipe socket (8) projecting freely into the interior 
(B)
 of the pipe (7) has an oblique 
face (25), and the opening (14) faces the inlet (21) of the intake socket (6).  

 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 one end of 
the pipe socket (8) projecting freely into the interior 
(B)
 of the pipe (7) has an oblique 
face (26), and the opening (14) faces away from the inlet (21) of the intake socket (6). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pipe 
socket (8) opens into the intake pipe (7), and the intake pipe (7) has a cross-sectional 

narrowing (23) in the region of the inlet of the pipe socket (8) and forms a diffusor.
