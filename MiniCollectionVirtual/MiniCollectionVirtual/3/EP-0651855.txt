<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas-fueled 
internal combustion engines adapted especially for 
residential heat pump systems. It is well known in the prior art to use 
high compression ratio combustion chambers for 
internal combustion engines using a gasoline vapor 
fuel for stationary installations. These include 
four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines in which 
the fuel is injected directly into the air intake port 
of the combustion chamber or into the air induction 
manifold as well as engines that use a carburetted 
air/fuel supply. Research and development efforts in 
recent years have built upon earlier technology 
devoted to Otto cycle gasoline engines to improve the 
specific power output and to satisfy the recent 
emphasis placed on improving exhaust emissions and 
increasing -fuel economy. It is recognized that one of the ways to 
achieve improved fuel economy and to reduce 
undesirable exhaust emissions is to design the 
combustion chamber to achieve higher compression 
ratios while avoiding undesirable fuel pre-ignition in 
the cylinders. An attempt has been made in recent 
years also to improve engine operating efficiency by 
designing the engine to operate at leaner air/fuel 
ratios.  
 A high degree of fuel and air mixing is 
desirable because of its effect on engine performance. 
This characteristic usually is referred to as a 
homogeneous mixing of the combustible charge. It 
takes into account the gas dynamics, heat transfer and 
mass transfer that occurs during the induction process 
and during the combustion stages of the operating 
cycle. The homogeneous nature of the combustible 
charge is affected by the timing of the opening of the 
inlet and exhaust valves during the combustion cycle, 
the presence of exhaust gas residuals and the mixing 
of the air and fuel in the combustion chamber, as well 
as the leanness of the air and fuel mixture. Factors that affect the characteristics of 
the combustible mixture in the combustion chamber 
include the heat transfer that occurs between the 
cylinder walls and the combustible charge at the time 
of induction as well as at later stages in the 
combustion stroke. The combustion cycle is not truly 
adiabatic. The parameters that affect the combustion 
and the combustion efficiency are the degree of 
advance of the spark timing and the characteristics of 
the flame front as well as the presence of pre-ignition 
reactions and so-called "hot spots" in the 
combustion chamber. It also is known in the art that the 
generation of a
