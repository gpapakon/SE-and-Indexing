<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock with flat
tumblers and changeable combination.Locks with flat tumblers and changeable combination
are known in the art, for example from British patent no.
2,081,796, from International Application WO91/02871, from
Italian patent Appln. no. 67729A/90, and from German patent
no. 565,027.In these known locks, the tumblers oscillate with
respect to a fulcrum and changing the combination consists
in varying the extent of said oscillation, for example by
moving the tumblers with respect to the fulcrum.In French patent no. 2,663,072 the combination is
changed by varying the position of the tumblers with
respect to the position of respective contrast elements.All known locks share the drawback that in order to
change the combination it is necessary to open the lock
itself to reposition the tumblers. Since this operation
requires disassembling the already-installed lock, it has
turned out to be very difficult, in addition to the fact
that repositioning the tumblers requires a certain skill on
the part of the operator.A principal aim of the present invention is now to
provide a lock with flat tumblers and changeable
combination that allows to obviate the above described
drawbacks.This aim is achieved by means of a lock with flat
tumblers and changeable combination
as defined in the appended claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages will become 
apparent from the following detailed description of an
embodiment, illustrated only by way of non-limitative
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a view of the lock in operating
condition;figure 2 is a view of the same lock in the
combination-changing position;figure 3 is a sectional view, taken along the plane
III-III of figure 1;figures 4 and 5 are views of a detail of the lock of
figures 1 and 2;figures 6 and 7 are views of a safety device suitable
to avoid possible jamming of the lock during combination
changing;figure 8 is a view of a different embodiment of the
device of figures 6 and 7. With reference to the above figures, the reference
numeral 1 designates the faceplate of the lock casing which
furthermore comprises the bottom 2, which is surrounded by
a peripheral wall composed of the walls 3, 4, and 5, which
are respectively referenced as upper, rear, and lower wall
with reference to the drawing for the sake of convenience
in description. The reference numeral 6 designates the
cover that closes the casing.The rectangular opening 7 is formed in the faceplate
1, and the bolt 8 protrudes outside

Lock with flat tumblers and changeable combination,
comprising a box-like body (2-6) which slidingly

accommodates a bolt (8) provided with a tang (9) that has
teeth (10) for moving the bolt by means of an actuation key

with double bit serrations, said tang (9) also comprising a
transverse pin (35) that engages in openings (32) of the

tumblers (17) which extend in the direction (A) along which
the bolt (8) slides and have, along their longitudinal

edges, oppositely arranged teeth (33) that form passages
through which said pin (35) advances by successive turns;

characterized in that each tumbler (17) is composed of a
first part (19), which is provided with said openings (32)

and is guided at right angles to said tang (9) between a
position for blocking said bolt (8), in which said pin (35)

engages between the teeth (33) of said opening (32), and a
position for the sliding of the bolt (8), wherein said pin

(35) can slide through said passages; and of a second part
(18), which is mounted between two plates (38, 39) which

are mutually rigidly coupled and are guided in a direction
that is parallel to the sliding direction (A) of said bolt

(8); in that said second parts (18) are guided between said
plates (38, 39) parallel to said first parts (19) and can

be actuated by virtue of key means with double bit serrations;
in that said first and second parts (18, 19) of each tumbler (17) have mutually

opposite sets of teeth (24, 25) which are adapted to mesh
with each other in order to keep said parts (18, 19)

coupled in a direction (B) that lies at right angles to the
bolt (8); in that at least one (38) of said plates (38, 39) 

has a recess (54) which allows the pin (35) of the bolt (8)
to slide freely and forms an abutment tooth (56) for said

pin (35) when the bolt (8) is fully projected from said
box-like body (2-6); the lock being such that a

first combination-changing key (C) of said key means is suitable to
lift the tumblers (17) into a position in which said pin

(35) is in front of a notch (36) which is located at a
different level relative to said passages between the teeth

(33), the first combination-changing key (C) acting thus on the tang (9) of the bolt (8) so as to
move said pin (35) such that it acts on said abutment tooth (56) and

therefore moves said plates (38, 39) into a position in
which the sets of teeth (24, 25) of the first and second

parts (18, 19) are mutually disengaged; the lock being further such that a second
combination-changing key (C1) of said key means, by acting on said

second part (18) of the tumblers (17), raises them subsequently
according to a new combination; lever means (57) being

furthermore provided, said lever means cooperating with
said pin (35) so that when said second combination-changing

key (C1) is actuated so as to retract said bolt (8)
into said box-like body (2-6) said lever means (57), moved by the pin (35), act on

at least one of said plates (38, 39) to move said second
parts (18) of the tumblers (17) into a position in which

their sets of teeth (24) mesh with the sets of teeth (25)
of said first parts (19), so as to preset the tumblers (17)

according to the combination of a new actuation key with
double bit serrations.
Lock according to claim 1, characterized in that
said lever means are constituted by a lever (57) which is

articulated in the box-like body (2-6) and is accommodated
in a recess (55) of said plate (38-39) which has said tooth 

(56), said lever (57) comprising a first arm (59), which
lies substantially parallel to the sliding direction (A) of

the bolt (8), and a second arm (60), which engages said
tooth (56) on the side that is opposite to the one where

said pin (35) abuts, said first arm (59) forming a cam (61)
that cooperates with said pin (35) so that when said second

combination-changing key (C1) returns the bolt (8) inside
the box-like body (2-6) said pin (35) acts on said cam (61)

so as to cause the rotation of the lever (57) in the
direction in which said second arm (59) acts on said plate

(38, 39) to restore the mutual meshing of the sets of teeth
(24, 25) of said first and second parts (18, 19) of the

tumblers (17).
