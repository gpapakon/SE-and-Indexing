<ABSTRACT>
A razor blade assembly (10) for mounting on a handle via a pivotal connection, the assembly including a housing (12) that carries three blade members (18, 20, 22), each having leading edges (29), and has a guard portion (14), a cap structure (2), and arcuate bearing surfaces (42, 44) below the blade carrying portion that pivotally engage shell bearing connections of the handle. The pivot axis of the razor blade assembly is located in a region defined by an imaginary boundary extending from the first leading edge to the second leading edge when both are in the unloaded position, extending upward and rearward from the second leading edge to a position slightly above the upper surface of the housing at a location in front of the third leading edge, extending along and slightly above the upper surface of the housing to a position in front of the first leading edge, extending downward and forward to a location within the guard portion (14) below and forward of the first leading edge, and extending from the location within the guard portion upward and rearward to the first leading edge. The pivot axis is advantageously located at the secondary blade member leading edge. In preferred embodiments the blade members are resiliently mounted, and at least two of the blade member leading edges have sharpened cutting edges. The housing is provided with a cam surface (54) engaged by a spring loaded cam follower (70) on the razor handle (72), and the cam can be contoured to provide an at-rest position other than a position midway between the limit of forward and rearward arcuate travel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to razor blade
assemblies for mounting on handles via pivotal
connections.A well-known razor blade assembly, e.g., as
shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,573,266 and 4,586,255,
employs a spring-biased guard member at the front of
the assembly, a lubricating-strip cap portion at the
back, and two spring-biased blade members between them
U.S. Patent No. 5,249,361 shows a similar razor blade
assembly with a fixed-guard. Both versions of the
assembly have rails and circular surfaces for making
pivotal connections with shell bearings on razor
handles. Spring-biased cam followers on the razor
handles interact with cam surfaces on the bottoms of
the razor blade assemblies so as to bias the assemblies
to neutral positions relative to the handles. During
shaving, the assembly can pivot forward (clockwise) or
backward (counterclockwise) from the neutral position
relative to the handle, and the blades can
move within the housing relative to the skin surface in
order to follow the contours of the skin surface during
shaving. In commercial embodiments of these razor
blade assemblies (available under the Sensor and Sensor
Excel trade designations from The Gillette Company),
upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based,
the shell bearings provide pivoting about an axis
located between and above the two resiliently moving 
blades (considering their unloaded state as a
reference). In particular, the pivot axis is located
at the center of the slot in which the primary
(forewardmost) blade supporting member is disposed and
at the top of a clip that retains the blade members to
the cartridge housing. Thus, the pivot axis is
provided above the cutting edges of the blades and
above the housing. This pivot axis location may
therefore be referred to as being located "in the face"
(that is, above the skin-engaging members) during
shaving of a face. The razor blade assemblies are
discarded after a number of shaves, and replacement
razor blade assemblies are used with the handles
containing the shell bearings and the spring-biased cam
followers. The same razor handle can be used with both
versions of the razor blade assembly, because they both
have the same size rails and circular surfaces.It is desired to improve shaving performance
by providing three blades within a cartridge. However,
simply accommodating a third blade in a widened
conventional twin blade cartridge housing, which also
supports skin-engaging guard and cap surfaces, results
in a geometric interference between the shell bearings
of the handle and the
