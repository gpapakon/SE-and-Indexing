<ABSTRACT>
A trocar and trocar obturator assembly having an 
obturator and a locking mechanism responsive to proximal, 

axial movement of the trocar obturator is disclosed. The 
trocar obturator has an elongated obturator shaft (150) having 

a proximal end and a distal end with a piercing tip (160) 
mounted thereto. The proximal end of the trocar obturator 

shaft is slidably mounted in a handle (170) such that the 
obturator shaft is moveable axially. A protective safety 

shield (190) having a distal end and a proximal end with a 
flange member (198) mounted to the proximal end is slidably 

mounted on the trocar obturator. The safety shield is 
moveable, axially, between an extended distal position and 

a retracted proximal position. The protective safety 
shield is disposed concentrically about the obturator. A 

lockout arm (230) for locking the safety shield in a locked 
extended position is mounted in the trocar obturator 

handle. An actuating collar member (250) is mounted to the 
proximal end of the obturator shaft in the obturator 

handle and is moveable with the obturator shaft. The 
obturator collar disengages the locking arm when moved 

proximally and engages the locking arm when trocar is 
armed. The trocar obturator assembly may be 

concentrically mounted in a trocar cannula having a 
passageway for receiving the trocar obturator and safety 

shield. The locking mechanism is actuated by proximal, 
axial motion of the obturator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention relates is 
surgical instruments, more particularly, endoscopic 
surgical instruments. The field of endoscopic surgery has become widely embraced 
by both surgeons and the public. The term "endoscopic" as 
used herein is defined to include the field of minimally 
invasive surgery including but not limited to endoscopic, 
laparoscopic, thoracoscopic and arthroscopic. There are 
numerous benefits associated with the use of endosurgical 
techniques including reduced trauma, reduced post-operative 
recuperation period, reduced incidence of 
infections, and reduced scarring. In addition, there 
tends to be a decrease in the length of endoscopic 
operative procedures when compared with conventional, open 
procedures, resulting in decreased time under general 
anesthesia. It is not unusual for patients who have 
undergone endoscopic surgical operations to be released 
from the hospital the next day after surgery and to be 
back on the job within several days. Recuperation periods 
of 2 to 4 weeks or more are associated with similar 
operations done using conventional, open surgical 
procedures. Numerous endoscopic instruments have been developed which 
allow the surgeon to perform complex surgical procedures 
with minimal incisions into the skin and tissue  
 
surrounding a particular body cavity. In order to 
introduce the endoscopic instruments into a body cavity, 
it is first necessary to puncture and cannulate the body 
cavity by using a trocar. Trocars are widely known in the 
art and typically consist of an obturator and a trocar 
cannula. Trocars may have a protective housing or safety 
shield around the obturator which covers the sharp 
piercing tip of the obturator after insertion. One type of trocar having an obturator safety shield is 
typically inserted by pressing the distal end of the 
trocar assembly against the outer skin of the patient with 
sufficient force to cause the piercing end of the 
obturator to pierce through the skin, underlying fat, 
muscle and fascia into a body cavity. Once the surgeon 
has properly positioned the trocar within the body cavity, 
the obturator and safety shield are removed, and, the 
trocar cannula is then available as a pathway, e.g., for 
the insertion of conventional endoscopic instruments and 
devices. Conventional trocar obturators typically consist of an 
elongated obturator shaft having a distal piercing tip. 
The proximal end of the obturator shaft is typically 
mounted in an obturator handle. A biased safety shield

A trocar obturator assembly (170), comprising: 

a hollow obturator handle (180); 
an elongated obturator shaft (155) having a proximal 
end and a distal end (159), the proximal end (156) of the 

obturator shaft (155) slidably mounted in the handle (180); 
a piercing tip (160) mounted to the distal end of the 
obturator shaft (155); 
a safety shield (190) slidably mounted on the 
obturator shaft (155), said safety shield (190)
