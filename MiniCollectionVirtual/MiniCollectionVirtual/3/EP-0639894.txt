output terminal of the transistor, being of a type which 
comprises an error amplifier (1'), a driver circuit (P') 

for said transistor (T'p), and a means of detecting the 
current (IL) flowing through said load (ZL) provided with 

at least first and second terminals, is characterized in 
that it comprises a circuit block (2) having an input 

terminal connected to the control terminal of (T'p) and an

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a limiter circuit for the maximum 
current passed from a power transistor to a load connected 
between one output terminal of the transistor and a first 
terminal of a voltage supply. In particular, the invention relates to a limiter circuit 
for the maximum current passed from a power transistor to a 
load connected between a first output terminal of the power 
transistor and a first voltage supply pole, comprising: 
a driver stage for said power transistor, having an input 
terminal adapted to receive a control signal and an output 
terminal connected to the control terminal of said power 
transistor; an error amplifier incorporating an internal current generator and 
having a first and a second terminal and an output terminal connected 
to said driver stage; and a circuit means for detecting the current being flowed 
through said load, having a first terminal connected to a 
second output terminal of said power transistor and a second 
terminal connected to a second supply pole. There are many ways of limiting the maximum current through 
a load connected to an output terminal of a power 
transistor. The most widely used method provides a feedback 
network comprising an error amplifier, one input whereof is 
connected to a reference voltage and the other input to a 
circuit means of detecting the current flowing through the 
load, while its output is connected to the control terminal 
of the transistor. That error amplifier basically performs 
a comparison between the reference voltage with that 
applied to the other of its inputs, which voltage increases 
with the current through the load. When these two voltages  
 
tend to become equal to each other, the error amplifier 
output will limit the current at the transistor control 
terminal, and accordingly, limit the current at the output 
terminal connected to the load. A major problem to be faced with such negative feedback 
arrangements is one of stability, especially where the load 
connected to the transistor is an inductive one. In fact, a 
load of this type introduces undesired poles into the 
transfer function, such that it becomes difficult to 
compensate the negatively fed-back transistor for frequency 
on account of the transistor being liable to begin to 
oscillate as soon as the error amplifier cuts in. JP-A 60-096919 in Patent Abstracts of Japan 
discloses a limiter circuit as defined in the first part of claim 1. The circuit disclosed in European Patent No. 0151764-B is 
exemplary of an effective compensation,
