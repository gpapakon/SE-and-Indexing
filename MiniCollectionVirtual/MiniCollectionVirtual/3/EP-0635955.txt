<ABSTRACT>
The clock rate signal contained within a variable data rate signal is identified. The input signal (b) is sampled with a high frequency reference signal (c) and the valves obtained are entered into memory. A start-of-pulse signal (d) is used to set a counter to zero to count the high frequency pulses. A further counter is set with a specific value that corresponds to 3/4 of the cycle period (IDI). At the end of the counting cycle a centre of pulse signal (ICF) is identified.
