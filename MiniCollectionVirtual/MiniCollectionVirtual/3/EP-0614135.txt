<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid dispensing reservoir (1) with an 
outlet (3) opening provided in the (bottom) 

wall of the same. The outlet (3) 
opening merges into an auxiliary reservoir (4) located under the (main) 

reservoir (1), that is provided with an auxiliary outlet opening (3) and 
accommodates a float type valve body (6) that cooperates with the outlet 

opening (3) of the main reservoir (1). 
The sizes of the two outlet (3,5) opening 

are such that with the main reservoir (1) at least filled to a minimum 
level (III) and the auxiliary outlet (5) 

opening in the opened position, a 
substantially constant liquid level will be set within the auxiliary 

reservoir (4) due to the valve body (6) 
causing a regulated flow of liquid to 

discharge from the main reservoir (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a liquid dispensing reservoir with an 
outlet opening provided in the (bottom) wall of the same. As is known, the quantity Q per time unit flowing through an 
opening in a wall of a liquid reservoir is dependent on the liquid 
level h above the level of the outlet opening, according to the flow 
rate formula 
Q = mFâˆš2 gh, in which F represents the cross-sectional area of the outlet opening 
and m is a contraction factor, the latter having the value 1 when the 
outlet opening has been rounded off on the inner side. To cause a reservoir loaded with a certain amount of liquid to 
empty with a (substantially) constant liquid flow or, more generally, 
to cause a (substantially) constant liquid flow rate from a reservoir 
having a varying liquid level, the effective cross-sectional area of 
the outlet opening would have to be varied inversely proportional to 
the square root of the liquid level. It would be difficult to realize such a variation with means, 
which sense the liquid level within the reservoir to control a valve, 
that controls the cross-sectional area of the outlet opening. In view of the fact that relatively low pressures are involved 
here, no use can be either made of existing flow restrictors, as these 
restrictors are designed to operate under relatively high pressures; 
moreover such restrictors are relatively expensive. The present invention aims at providing a liquid dispensing 
reservoir, wherein constructionally simple and effective means allow 
to obtain a substantially constant outlet flow with a varying and in 
particularly a decreasing liquid level in the (main) reservoir. According to the invention this aim is achieved, in that the 
outlet opening merges into an auxiliary reservoir located under the 
(main) reservoir, said auxiliary reservoir having an auxiliary outlet 
opening and containing a float type valve body that cooperates with 
the outlet opening of the main reservoir, the sizes of the two outlet 
openings being such that with the main reservoir at least filled to a 
minimum level and the auxiliary outlet opening in the opened position, 
a substantially constant liquid level will be set within the auxiliary 
reservoir due to the valve body causing a regulated flow of liquid to 
discharge from the main reservoir.  The substantially constant liquid level within the auxiliary 
reservoir secures a correspondingly constant outlet flow through the 
outlet opening of said reservoir. The liquid dispensing reservoir according to the invention is 
particula
