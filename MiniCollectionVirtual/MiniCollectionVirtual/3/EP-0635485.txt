<ABSTRACT>
A 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalamide derivative and a 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroisophthalimide derivative, both having an excellent efficay 

as the active ingredient of a herbicide, and an industrial process for efficiently producing these higher-performance, herbicidally 
active compounds. A tetrahydrophthalamide derivative represented by general formula (I) is produced by the reaction of a 

tetrahydrophthalimide derivative, prepared by the reaction of a halogenated 5-cycloalkyloxyaniline derivative with 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalic 
anhydride, or of the tetrahydroisophthalimide derivative of the invention with various amines. These tetrahydrophthalamide 

and tetrahydroisophthalimide derivatives have an excellent herbicidal effect in the treatment of lowland and upland 
soils and foliage treatment. The tetrahydroisophthalimide derivative is useful also as an intermediate for producing the tetrahydrophthalamide 

derivative and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
In recent years, chemical agricultural agents 
have been essential materials for modern agriculture, and, 
as social demands for these chemical agricultural agents 
including herbicides, agents having low toxicity and 
residue and high selectivity to crops are desired. The 
present invention is to provide novel herbicides which 
meet the above-described social demands. More specifically, the present invention relates 
to a 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalamide derivative represented 
by the general formula (I): 
 
wherein X1 represents a halogen atom, X2 represents 
a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, R1 represents a 
cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms which may 
be substituted, R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a chlorine 
atom or a methyl group, R3 and R4 each independently 
represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 
to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 9 
carbon atoms, an aryl group having from 6 to 10 carbon 
atoms, an alkenyl group having from 3 to 5 carbon atoms or 
an alkynyl group having from 3 to 5 carbon atoms, or R3 and  
 
R4 may form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they 
are attached, a substituted or unsubstituted alicyclic 
heterocyclic ring; a process for preparing the same; and 
a herbicide containing the same as an active ingredient. Further, the present invention relates to a 
3,4,5,6-tetrahydroisophthalimide derivative represented by 
the general formula (V): 
 
wherein X1 represents a halogen atom, X2 represents 
a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, R1 represents a 
cycloakyl group having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms which 
may be substituted, A-B represents NH-C(OH) or N=C, and R2 
represents a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom or a methyl 
group; a process for preparing the same; and a herbicide 
containing the same as an active ingredient. Also, the 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroisophthalimide 
derivatives represented by the general formula (V) per 
se are useful as active ingredients of the herbicide, and 
also, for example, 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimideohydroxy 
derivatives represented by the general formula (V) wherein 
A-B represents NH-C(OH) can be easily converted by 
dehydration reaction under heating into the 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide 
derivatives represented by the 
general formula (II) which are useful as active ingredients 
for the herbicides disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication  
 
(Kokai) No. 4-164067. (Refer to Reference Example 19 
below.) 
Furthermore, the 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroisophthalimide 
derivatives represented by the general
