<ABSTRACT>
The transmitted power control is effected in a hierarchical system comprising two levels. In the upper level, which forms a closed control loop comprising a base station and a mobile station, the long-term transmitted power of the mobile station is controlled in the base station. In addition, a statement regarding the decision authority of the lower level is made in the base station and forwarded to the mobile station. In the lower level, which represents a local control implemented in the mobile station, the short-term transmitted power of the mobile station is determined taking into account the long-term transmitted power determined by the base station and the statement regarding the decision authority of the lower level.

Method of regulating the transmission power of a mobile station in a
cellular mobile radio network with base stations in a mutual spatial arrangement,
characterized in that
a hierarchical system consisting of two layers such that in the upper layer, which
forms a closed control loop including a base station and a mobile station, the

control of the long-term transmission power (
P
t,ul
) of the mobile station is
exercised in the base station and that additionally in the base station a statement of

the competence of the lower layer is made and this is transmitted to the mobile
station,
and that in the lower layer, which forms a local control implemented in the mobile
station, the short-term transmission power P
t,ul
 of the mobile station is determined
taking account of the long-term transmission power determined by the base station

and the statement of the competence of the lower layer.
Method in accordance with claim 1
characterized in that
the regulation of the long-term transmission power (
P
t,ul
) of the mobile station is
implemented in the base station on the basis of the reception power (P
t,ul
) and
reception quality (Q
r,ul
) of the uplink, filtered in each case using N samples, which
if necessary is subjected to further filtering, as well as of threshold values for both

variables stipulated as Operation 
&
 Maintenance parameters, and that,
additionally, from the base station for control of its transmission power known

values, filtered in each case using N samples, of the reception power and reception
quality of the downlink (P
r,dl
, Q
r,dl
) as well as the already-known reception values 
(P
r,ul
, Q
r,ul
) of the mobile station are used to estimate the reciprocity of the
transmission channel and this is transmitted to the mobile station, and furthermore

the local control in the mobile station is implemented on the basis of the
measurements of the reception values of the mobile station, in that the reception

quality (Q
r,dl
), filtered using N/K samples, where K is an Operation 
&
 Maintenance
parameter, with the overriding identifier, from which the permissible trend and

maximum permissible deviation of the short-term transmission power (P
t,ul
) is
derived from the specified long-term transmission power (
P
t,ul
), is processed in the
short-term control algorithm to calculate the short-term transmission power (P
t,ul
)
of the mobile station.
Method in accordance with claims 1 or 2
characterized in that
the upper limit of the factor K is fixed by the averaging of the fast fading.
Method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 3
characterized in that
the permissible change in direction and the maximum permissible amount is made
dependent on the type and level of the last change of the long-term transmission

power (
P
t,ul
) of the mobile station.
Method in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4
characterized in that
to determine the reciprocity criterion from the averaged quality values of the base
station to mobile station and mobile station to base station radio links, the

difference is formed and where the amount of this difference is less than or equal
to an Operation 
&
 Maintenance parameter, the mobile station can itself control its
transmission power within a specified bandwidth, where the difference is positive

and the amount is greater than the Operation 
&
 Maintenance parameter, the
mobile station can reduce its transmission power only within a specified limit and

where the difference is negative and the amount greater than the Operation 
&

Maintenance parameter the mobile station can only increase its transmission
power within a specified limit.
