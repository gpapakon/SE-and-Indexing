<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure control unit having a changeover 
valve and an electromagnetic discharge valve (2) combined with 

each other so that with the opening and closing of the 
latter valve, the communication between the inlet (4a) leading 

to the pressure source and the first (4b) and second (4c) outlets 
leading to wheel brakes is changed over for normal braking, 

pressure reduction for antilock control and pressure reincrease. 
Part of the sleeve (4) of the changeover valve is 

used as the frame of the discharge valve (2) which functions as 
a magnetic circuit. This reduces the number of parts and 

eliminates the need of O-ring and facilitates maintenance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid pressure control 
device for a wheel brake which has a smaller number of 
component parts and can be assembled easily. Fig. 3 shows a conventional fluid pressure control 
device. Numeral 1 in the figure indicates a changeover 
valve having flow rate control function. Numeral 2 is an 
electromagnetic discharge valve. The changeover valve 1 
comprises a cylindrical sleeve 4 inserted in a bore formed 
in a housing 3, a spool 5 slidably mounted in the sleeve 4, 
and a return spring 6 urging the spool 5 in one direction. The sleeve 4 has an inlet port 4a communicating with 
a pressure source (a master cylinder and a pump; neither is 
shown) and first and second outlet ports 4b and 4c 
communicating with wheel brakes (not shown). The spool 5 has a fluid passage 5a therein which 
communicates an input chamber 7, in which the front end of 
the spool is disposed, with a pressure reduction chamber 8, 
in which the rear end of the spool is disposed, by way of 
an orifice 9. When the spool 5 is in the illustrated 
position, i.e. when it is at the extreme end of its 
movement toward the input chamber 7, the inlet port 4a 
communicates not through the orifice 9 but directly with 
the first outlet port 4b. As the spool 5 moves toward the  
 
pressure reduction chamber 8, fluid communication between 
the inlet port 4a and the first outlet port 4b is cut off, 
while the second outlet port 4c, which has been closed, is 
brought into communication with the pressure reduction 
chamber 8 through a groove formed in the outer periphery of 
the spool 5. The discharge valve 2 has a frame 10 made of a 
magnetic material and inserted into the bore of the housing 
3 so that it engages the rear end of the sleeve 4 with a 
liquid-tight seal therebetween. The discharge valve 2 has 
a fixed valve seat 11 provided in the frame 10 which serves 
as a magnetic circuit. By activating a solenoid coil 12, 
an armature 14, which is biased by a spring 13, is pulled 
by the magnetic force produced by the coil 12, so that a 
valve body 15 provided on the front end of the armature 
moves away from the fixed valve seat 11. The pressure 
reduction chamber 8 is thus brought into communication with 
a discharge port 16. In an ordinary braking mode, the fluid pressures in 
the input chamber 7 and the pressure reduction chamber 8 
are equal to each other, so that the spool 5 is maintained 
in its original position by the force of the spring 6. 
Thus, brake fluid is freely movable between the pressure 
source and the

In a fluid pressure control device having a 
changeover valve (1) comprising a cylindrical sleeve (4) having an 

inlet port (4a) leading to a pressure source and a first outlet (4b) 
and a second outlet (4c), a spool (5) slidably mounted in said 

sleeve (4), and a return spring (6) for biasing said spool (5) toward 
an input chamber (7) in which one end of said spool (5) is 

disposed; and further having an electromagnetic discharge 
valve (2) for opening and closing a discharge passage leading 

from a pressure reduction chamber (8) in which the other end of 
said spool (5) is disposed, said spool (5) having a fluid passage (5a) 

through which said input chamber (7) and said pressure 
reduction chamber (8) communicate with each other by way of an 

orifice (9), said fluid pressure control device being so 
constructed that when said spool (5) is in one extreme position 

biassed by said return spring (6), said inlet port (4a) 
communicates, not through the orifice (9), with said first 

outlet (4b), and when said discharge valve (2) opens and said spool (5) 
moves from said one extreme position toward said pressure 

reduction chamber (8) under a differential pressure between 
said input chamber (7) and said pressure reduction chamber (8), the 

fluid communication between said inlet port (4a) and said first 
outlet (4b) is cut off and said second outlet (4c) communicates with 

said pressure reduction chamber (8), and further when said  
 

discharge valve (2) is closed and until said pressure 
differential decreases below a predetermined value, said 

second outlet (4c) being kept in communication with said inlet (4a)

discharge valve (2) has a frame made of a magnetic material, 

said frame being formed as a part of said sleeve (4). 
A fluid pressure control device as claimed in claim 1 
wherein said discharge valve (2) has a fixed valve seat (11) press-fitted 

in said sleeve (4) and used for opening and closing said 
passage. 
A fluid pressure control device as claimed in claim 2 
wherein said return spring (6) is supported on said fixed valve
