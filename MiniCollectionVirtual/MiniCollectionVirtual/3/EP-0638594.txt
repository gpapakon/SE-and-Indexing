<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chlorinated
ethylene/α-olefin copolymer rubber and a composition
containing the same. More specifically, this invention
relates to a chlorinated ethylene/α-olefin copolymer
rubber which is excellent in rubber elasticity and
which is quite useful as a sealing material that is a
typical usage of a rubber product, and a composition
containing the same.Chlorinated ethylene/α-olefin copolymer
rubbers are disclosed in Rubber Chem. Technol. 49 353
(1976) and Japanese Laid-open Patent Application
(Kokai) Nos. 99,149/1985, 182,340/1989 and
296,506/1991, and are therefore already well known.The chlorinated ethylene/α-olefin copolymer
rubbers are excellent in ozone resistance, resistance
to heat ageing, weather resistance and oil resistance,
but involve a problem that they can hardly be used in a
sealing material because of their low modulus.EP-A-487272 describes a functionalized olefin polymer
obtained by introducing an epoxy group, a hydroxyl group or
a sulfonic group into a syndiotactic α-olefin polymer
having an olefinic unsaturated bond at its terminus. There
is no teaching of introducing a chlorine moiety or of
introducing such a moiety at positions in the polymer other
than the terminus. The polymer of EP-A-487272 is said to be
useful in blending with other resins to improve the impact
resistance of e.g. a blend of polyphenylene ether and
polypropylene.WO-A-93/24539 is prior art under Art. 54(3) (4) EPC.
This document discloses the catalyzed preparation and
reactions of a reactive low molecular weight (m.w. of 300
to 10,000) viscous essentially-1-olefin-containing poly(1-olefin)
or copoly(1-olefin) prepared from a feedstock
containing one or more C3 to C20 1-olefin and another 
hydrocarbon (non-1-olefin), preferably one or more volatile
hydrocarbon liquid. Particularly preferred feeds are ones
which contain propene and/or 1-butene or a butane-butylene
refinery stream.US-A-5087673 discloses a chlorinated ethylene-propylene
copolymer having a chlorine content of 20 to 45%
by weight and a Mooney viscosity (ML1+4, 100°C) of 10 to 150
which is produced by chlorinating in two or three stages,
by contact with chlorine gas in an aqueous suspension, an
ethylene-propylene copolymer having a propylene content of
15 to 40% by weight, a melt flow index of 0.01 to 5.0 g/10
minutes, a melting peak as measured by differential scan
calorimeter (DSC) of 80°C, or more, a crystallinity as
measured by X-rays of 3% or more, an index Mw/Mn of the
distribution of molecular weight, determined by gel
perme
