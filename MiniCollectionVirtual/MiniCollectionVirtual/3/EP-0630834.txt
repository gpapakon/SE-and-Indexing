<ABSTRACT>
Chain conveyor (1), including a guide ramp, which is intended, in particular, for guiding and supporting the links of a chain for conveying products, having a self-supporting structure (3) formed from lateral flanks (4, 5) joined together. According to the invention, each lateral flank (4, 5) supports at least one inner top (6, 7) and bottom (8, 9) profile (section) delimiting, respectively, a top (11) and a bottom (12) inner housing constituting a belt for the gliding and guiding of the said links (2) of the chain. Application to the product-handling field.

Conveyor (1) comprising a conveying chain (2) and 
a guide ramp intended for guiding laterally and supporting 

the links of the said chain, the said links sliding 
on slide strips of the said ramp, the guide ramp constituting 

a self-supporting structure (3) formed from two 
lateral flanks (4, 5) connected to one another, confronting 

one another and located on either side of the chain 
(2), each lateral flank (4, 5) being associated with an 

upper slide strip and with a lower slide strip of the 
said ramp, in order to ensure the outward return travel 

of the chain, the said lateral flanks (4, 5) defining 
between them a space in which the said slide strips are 

arranged, the upper profiles (6, 7), on the one hand, and 
the lower profiles (8, 9), on the other hand, being 

respectively connected to one another by means of spacers 
(13), characterized in that each slide strip consists of 

one of the branches of an L-shaped profile (6, 7, 8, 9), 
the other branch of which is secured to the lateral flank 

(4, 5) adjacent to it, the said profiles (6, 7, 8, 9) 
being fastened to the said lateral flanks (4, 5) in such 

a way that a U-shaped cavity is formed in each case by 
the branches of the upper (6, 7) and lower (8, 9) profiles 

which ensure that the chain both is guided and 
slides in the said cavity. 
Conveyor according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a spacer (13) associated with the lower profiles (8, 

9) has an axial bore extended by bores made in the lower 
profiles (8, 9), in order to receive a screw (15
a
) for 
supporting the lateral flanks (4, 5).  

 
Conveyor according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the spacers (13) constitute the 

only connecting elements between the lateral flanks (4, 
5), so as to leave open access to the upper receptacle 

(11) and lower receptacle (12) which are delimited 
respectively between the upper (6, 7) and lower (8, 9) 

profiles. 
Conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that each lateral flank (4, 5) has, in 

its upper part, a bent-round portion (4
a
, 5
a
), in which 
the upper end of the upper profile (6, 7) which is 

adjacent to the said lateral flank is fitted. 
Conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the angles of the cross-section of 

each profile (6, 7, 8, 9) are rounded. 
Conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the upper (6, 7) and lower (8, 9) 

profiles are produced from a solid isotropic material 
incapable of experiencing plastic deformation. 
Conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the upper (6, 7) and lower (8, 9) 

profiles are produced from polyamide or polyethylene. 
Conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the body (10) of the profile (7) 

comprises a shoulder (21) intended for cooperating with 
a cutout (20) of complementary shape to the links of the 

chain (2). 
Conveyor according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the shoulder (21) is made by machining and cooperates 

with a groove (20) in the links of the chain (2).
