<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mechanical transmission 
for drive wheels, especially for mobile work 

machines, comprising: a sprocket (6) keyed on a 
drive shaft (8) rotatably supported to a frame 

(13); an internally-cogged crown (4) connected to 
a hub (2) of a drive wheel of a work machine; at 

least one intermediate gear wheel (5) coupled to 
the sprocket (6) and the crown (4) and rotatable 

supported by an intermediate member (9). Two gear 
couplings (3) and (7) are provided, each of which 

is equipped with own externally-activated means 
for command, which gear couplings (3) and (7) 

connect the intermediate member (9) with the frame 
(13) and the drive shaft (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mechanical transmission 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Specifically but not exclusively the transmission 
is usefully applied to small mobile work machines, 
wherein the means for propulsion, usually wheels 
or tracks, are used mainly for moving masses of 
small proportions as well as for moving the 
machine itself, quite slowly, from one work 
position to another (such as in the case of 
excavators). For these purposes generally it is sufficient to 
use extremely simple and cheap traction means, 
constituted as a rule by a hydraulic rotary geared 
motor using the same hydraulic circuit that also 
activates the tool organs of the machine and which 
functions at constant or minimally-variable 
rotation speeds. Prior art mechanical transmissions for the above-described 
purpose usually equip a gear mechanism  
 
comprising a sprocket, solid to the drive shaft, 
connected through an idler gear to an internally-cogged 
crown wheel solid to the hub, with the 
drive wheel being solidly constrained to the 
crown. The mechanical transmissions have a fixed 
gear ratio, so the machine has only one speed, 
which is the same as the relatively low speed 
needed for it to perform its task or move about 
from one workplace to another.  
 The main drawback of the known work machines using 
such mechanical transmissions is that the machines 
are not truly able to make long journeys under 
their own power; their speed would render such 
journeys epic. Hence the machines are usually 
loaded onto other, faster vehicles for such 
journeys. PCT publication WO 91/00443 teaches a hub 
incorporating a planetary gear with two 
transmission ratios, selectable by means of a 
hydraulic clutch. This two-stage device is a very 
laborious solution, being neither highly functional 
nor economical. Further a hydraulically-actuated motor wheel having a planetary gear set and control 
system therefor and wherein selectively actuable hydraulically operated clutches are 
provided to lock the carrier of the planetary gear set to either a stationary housing or a 
rotatable casing to provide two speed ratios is shown by U.S. Pat. No. 3,770,075. This 
two-speed device is a very laborious solution since it is characterized by an axially 
movable carrier and by a complex hydraulic circuit which is necessary for actuating the 
clutches. The main aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks and 
limitations in the prior art by providing a  
 
mechanical transmission which is simple and
