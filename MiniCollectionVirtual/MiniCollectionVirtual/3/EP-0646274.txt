<DESCRIPTION>
Title: TELESCOPIC ANTENNAFIELD OF THE INNENÎ—ON: This invention relates to flexible, telescopic antennas.BACKGROUND OF THE INNENTION: Antennas can take many forms depending upon t-heir practical application and the wavelength(s) at which they are to operate. Two of the most useful general purpose types are the end-fed, multi-band antenna (or long wire type) and the vertical antenna. A common feature of antenna systems has been the use of conductive metals to form the receiving and/or transmitting element(s). For example, vehicle antennas may be made from phosphorus bronze or stainless steel.Vehicle antennas of the rod type are commonly made from telescopic hollow metal tubes. Such antennas are usually made so that there is a degree of "slop" between the tubular components to allow for distortion of the antenna during use, so that they may still be raised and lowered. Raising and lowering may be either manual or by means of an electric motor.Telescopic antennas for vehicles suffer from a number of disadvantages including ease of permanent bending out of shape and breaking or they may distort so that they no longer act telescopically. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or alleviate the disadvantages mentioned above.Thus it would be desirable to provide a telescopic antenna wh- -h can be readily restored to its original shape and is resistant to permanent bending out of shape. Thus the invention seeks to provide an antenna which combines the ease of storage of a telescopic antenna with the flexibility and resistance to breakage of a whip antenna.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: Accordingly this invention provides a flexible, telescopic antenna having a plurality of antenna elements, wherein each antenna element comprises a principal structural component based on a polymeric material, the polymeric material being associated with or impregnated with conductive material in the form of fibres and particles to formSUBSTITUTE SHEET
