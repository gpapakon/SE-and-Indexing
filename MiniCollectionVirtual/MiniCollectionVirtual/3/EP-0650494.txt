<DESCRIPTION>
GASTROINTESTINAL DEFENSINS, CDNA SEQUENCES -AND METHOD FOR THEPRODUCTION AND USE THEREOFField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to defensin peptides referred to herein as gastrointestinal defensin peptides. More particularly, the present invention is related to new members of a class of polypeptide with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, cDNA and genomic sequences encoding for the peptides, methods for the production and use thereof.Background of the InventionMulticellular organisms utilize a variety of mechanisms to defend against microbial invasion. These include anatomical and chemical barriers, as well as numerous cell- mediated and humoral responses. Collectively these defenses aim to eliminate offending microorganisms. Epithelial surfaces of many tissues are continually exposed to potential pathogenic organisms, yet the incidence of infectious disease following these encounters is relatively small, highlighting the effectiveness of defense mechanisms at these sights. Manifestations of abnormality of these defenses in the intestinal tract may include various forms of diarrhea associated with pathogenic bacteria and ulcerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, necrotizing enterocolitis and gastric ulcer disease. Peptide based antimicrobial defense is a conserved component of host defense, and is found in both the animal and plant kingdoms (for reviews see Boman and Hultmark, Ann Rev. Microbiol . , ___1 : 103-126 (1987); Bevins and Zasloff, Ann Rev . 

Biochem , J59.: 395-414 (1990) ; Spitznagel, J Clin . Invest . 86: 1381-86 (1990); Bo an, Cell 5: 205-207 (1991); Lehrer et al. , Cell ______: 229-230 (1991)). The size and structure of the antimicrobial peptides shows significant diversity, but in general, they are membrane-active amphipathic molecules with a net positive charge at neutral pH. There are two broadly defined families of these cationic peptides: linear peptides (for example cecropins; Steiner, et al., Nature 292: 246-248 (1981); and againins; (Zasloff, Proc. Natl . Acad . Sci . USA j34.: 5449-5453 (1987)) and cysteine-rich peptides. The latter include mammalian defensins (Ganz et al., Eur J Haematol 4_4: 1- 8 (1990)), tracheal antimicrobial peptide (Diamond, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 88:3952-3956 (1991), bovine bactenecins, (Romeo et al. J Biol Chem 263: 9573-9575 (1988)), insect royalisin, (Fujiwara et al., J Biol Chem 265:11333-11337 (1990)), tachyplesins (Naka ura, et al., J Biol Chem 263: 16709-16713 (1988); Shigenaga, et al., J.
