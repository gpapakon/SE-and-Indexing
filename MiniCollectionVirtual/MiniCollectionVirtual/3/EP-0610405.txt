<ABSTRACT>
Improved methodology and apparatus for the treatment of sleep apnea through (a) application of alternating high and low level positive airway pressure (26) within the airway of the patient (12) with the high and low airway pressure being coordinated (34) with the spontaneous respiration of the patient (12), (b) usage of adjustably programmable pressure ramp circuitry (104, 104') capable of producing multiple pressure ramp cycles of predetermined duration and pattern whereby the ramp cycles may be customized to accommodate the specific needs of an individual sleep apnea patient (12) so as to ease the patient's transition from wakefulness to sleep, and (c) remote control (106) operation of the apparatus for assisting those patients whose mobility or capacity for physical exertion is intrinsically limited.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
methodology and apparatus for treatment to sleep apnea
and, more particularly, to mono-level, bi-level, or
proportional assist ventilation (PAV) continuous positive
airway pressure (CPAP) apparatus including circuitry for
enabling a patient to selectively actuate one or more
pressure ramp cycles wherein, during each ramp cycle,
available airway pressure increases with time from a
predetermined minimum pressure value to a prescription
pressure, thereby facilitating the patient's transition,
from a waking to a sleeping state.The sleep apnea syndrome afflicts an estimated
1% to 3% of the general population and is due to episodic
upper airway obstruction during sleep. Those afflicted
with sleep apnea experience sleep fragmentation and
intermittent, complete or nearly complete cessation of
ventilation during sleep with potentially severe degrees
of oxyhemoglobin unsaturation. These features may be 
translated clinically into debilitating daytime
sleepiness, cardiac dysrhythmias, pulmonary-artery
hypertension, congestive heart failure and cognitive
dysfunction. Other sequelae of sleep apnea include right
ventricular dysfunction with cor pulmonale, carbon
dioxide retention during wakefulness as well as during
sleep, and continuous reduced arterial oxygen tension.
Hypersomnolent sleep apnea patients may be at risk for
excessive mortality from these factors as well as by an
elevated risk for accidents while driving and/or operating
potentially dangerous equipment.Although details of the pathogenesis of upper
airway obstruction in sleep apnea patients have not been
fully defined, it is generally accepted that the mechanism
includes either anatomic or functional abnormalities of
the upper airway which result in increased air flow
resistance. Such abnormalities may include narrowing of
the upper airway due to suction forces evolved during
inspiration, the effect of gravity pulling the tongue back
to appose the pharyngeal wall, and/or insufficient muscle
tone in the upper airway dilator muscles. It has also
been hypothesized that a mechanism responsible for the
known association between obesity and sleep apnea is
excessive soft tissue in the anterior and lateral neck
which applies sufficient pressure on internal structures
to narrow the airway.The treatment of sleep apnea has included such
surgical interventions as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty,
gastric surgery for obesity, and maxillo-facial
reconstruction. Another mode of surgical intervention
used in the treatment of sleep
