<ABSTRACT>
A method for updating subscriber data in a cellular radio system, and a corresponding cellular radio system, in which method a visitor location register (VLR) receives from a home location register (HLR) of the cellular radio system a restart indication (HLR Reset); and changes the restart number (HLR Reset Num) of the home location register which sent the restart indication in the home location register list of the visitor location register; when the visitor location register (VLR) receives from a mobile exchange (MSC) an indication of the establishment of a radio connection with a subscriber (MS), the visitor location register (VLR) compares the subscriber-specific restart number of the subscriber (MS) with the home location register restart number (HLR Reset Num) of the subscriber (MS), and updates the location data of the subscriber on the basis of the comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for updating
subscriber data in a cellular radio system, wherein a
visitor location register receives from a home location
register of the cellular radio system a home
location register restart indication indicating that
the home location register has restarted, and to a
cellular radio system comprising a subscriber data
list containing subscriber data.Various cellular radio or mobile telephone
systems are today used or being developed in which the
geographical area covered by the system is divided
into smaller separate radio areas or cells, so that
when a radio telephone or mobile radio resides in a
cell, it communicates with the fixed network through a
fixed radio station located in the cell. The mobile
radios belonging to the system are allowed to roam
freely within the area of the system from one cell to
another. Such systems include the digital mobile radio
system GSM (Global System for Mobiles).As is well-known in cellular radio networks, the
home location register (HLR) continuously stores the
location and subscriber data of mobile radios registered
in the network in a memory means, such as a RAM,
which data are lost e.g. when the HLR is switched off;
and at regular intervals in a non-volatile memory
means, such as a hard disk, where the data are stored
permanently. When the HLR occasionally has to restart,
the location and subscriber data stored in the
volatile memory are lost. In such a case, the HLR has
to request all visitor location registers (VLR) of the
mobile radio network to perform the location updating
of the subscribers of the respective HLR in order that 
the HLR would know the location data of its subscribers.
The HLR needs the subscriber location data
so as to be able to give the right location of the
subscriber to a mobile exchange wanting to forward a
call to this particular subscriber. In a prior art
solution described in GSM 03.08, February 1992,
Organisation of Subscriber Data, ETSI/PT 12, the
following subscriber-specific data, among others, are
stored in the VLR (Table 1 of the above specification):
IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Number,
subscriber-specific Radio Confirmation Indicator,
described in greater detail in Section 2.7.2.1. of the
above specification, HLR Confirmation Indicator,
described in greater detail in Section 2.7.2.2., and
the HLR address of the subscriber. In this prior art
solution the HLR indicates all VLRs in the radio
network that it has restarted, which is_described in
GSM 09.02, January 1991, Mobile

<CLAIMS>
Method for updating subscriber data in a
cellular radio system, wherein a visitor location

register (VLR) receives from a home location register
(HLR) of the cellular radio system a home location

register (HLR) restart indication (HLR Reset)
indicating that the home location register (HLR) has

restarted, 
characterized
 in that

a subscriber-specific restart number is included
in the subscriber data of the visitor location

register (VLR);
a home location register list (HLR List) is
included in the visitor location register (VLR), each

home location register identity (HLR Addr) having an
associated home location register restart number (HLR

Reset Num) in said home location register list;
the visitor location register (VLR) changes
the restart number (HLR Reset Num) of the home location

register which sent the restart indication in the
home location register list of the visitor location

register;
when the visitor location register (VLR)
receives from a mobile exchange (MSC) an indication of

the establishment of a radio connection with a subscriber
(MS), the visitor location register (VLR)

compares the subscriber-specific restart number of the
subscriber (MS) with the home location register restart

number (HLR Reset Num) of the subscriber (MS),
and initiates the updating of the location data of the

subscriber in the home location register (HLR) if
required on the basis of the comparison.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that when the subscriber-specific
restart number is unequal to the home location 

register restart number (HLR Reset Num), the subscriber
location data are updated.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that when the subscriber-specific
restart number is equal to the home location register

restart number (HLR Reset Num), the subscriber data
are not updated.
Cellular radio system comprising

   a subscriber data list (10) containing subscriber
data, 
characterized
 in that

the subscriber data list (10) contains a
subscriber-specific restart number, and that the

cellular radio system comprises:
a home location register list (3a) where the
identity of each home location register (HLR) corresponds

to the restart number (HLR Reset Num) of said each
home location register (HLR);
means (2, 3a) for processing a home location

register restart indication (HLR Reset) sent by
a home location register (HLR) and changing the

home-location-register-specific restart number (HLR
Reset Num) included in the home location register list

(HLR List, 3a) in response to the restart indication
(HLR Reset) sent by the home location register (HLR);
means (7) for comparing the subscriber-specific
restart number included in the subscriber

data list (10) with the home-location-register-specific
restart number (HLR Reset Num) included in

the home location register list (3a) in response to an
indication (4) sent by a mobile exchange (MSC1, MSC2)

so as to indicate that a radio connection (19) has
been established with the subscriber (MS), and

initiating the updating (12) of the subscriber data of
the subscriber (MS) in the home location register

(HLR) if required on the basis of the comparison (17).
