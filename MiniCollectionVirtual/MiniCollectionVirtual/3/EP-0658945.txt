<ABSTRACT>
The electrode plate includes an active part, pasted with active material, and a plate head constituted by three compressed metal foam layers: an unpasted part, of height G, of the support (1) of the electrode plate and two unpasted metal foam strips (2, 3), of height R, which frame the unpasted part, of height G, of the support (1) with an overlap height h2 on the pasted part of the support (1). The plate head includes a zone (4, 5, 8) of narrowed thickness, including a maximally compressed part (5, 8) and a transition part (4) between this maximally compressed part and the rest of the electrode of thickness e2. A part of this plate head forms a connection stem (5). The method for obtaining it consists in co-rolling of the three metal foam layers of the plate head, then cutting the plates so as to obtain the connection stem (5).

An electrode plate for an electrochemical cell and having a metal 
foam type support (1), the plate comprising a plate head (R) and an 

active portion proper (E) pasted that is with an active material, the 
plate being characterized in that said plate head includes a zone (4. 

5, 8) of thickness that is reduced relative to the thickness e
2
 of 
said active portion proper and extending along the entire length L of 

the plate along its top edge, said zone of reduced thickness having a 
small height h
1
 over a fraction of the length of the electrode plate 
and a greater height G over the remainder of the length of the 

electrode so as to form a connection tab (5), said zone of reduced 
thickness being made up of three thicknesses of non-pasted metal foam 

tightly compressed against one another: the first thickness being 
constituted by a non-pasted zone of the support (1) and the other two 

thicknesses being constituted by add-on pieces of metal foam (2, 3) 
on either side of the non-pasted zone of the support and having a 

small overlap height h
2
 over the pasted portion of the support, the 
zone corresponding to said overlap height h
2
 having the same nonreduced 
thickness e
2
 as the remainder of the electrode plate. 
A method of implementing electrode plates according to claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that the following operations are performed 

starting from a support tape of a metal foam (1) of height H and of 
initial thickness e
1
: 

a) active material is pasted on said support tape over a height 
H-G so as to conserve a non-pasted strip of height G at the top of 

the tape; 
b) said support tape is rolled and compressed so as to reduce 
its thickness to a value e
2
 that lies in the range about half to 
about two-thirds of e
1
; 
c) a metal foam strip (2, 3) of height R = G + h
2
 is placed on 
either side of the strip of height G of said support tape, and also 

over a small overlap height h
2
 overlying the pasted portion of said 
su
pport tape; 
d) the assembly comprising the two add-on tapes with the 
support tape between them is compressed by simultaneous rolling so as 

to reduce said assembly to the thickness e
2
;  
 
e) the zone of height G is maximally compressed, e.g. by 
rolling, said compression including a small transitional zone (4) 

between total crushing and the thickness e
2
 of the portion of height 
H-G; and 
f) the tape is cut up so as to form electrode plates of length 
L, and a fraction of the top portion of each electrode plate is cut 

off so as to leave a height of only h
1
 above the pasted portion of 
the electrode over a fraction of the length of the electrode so that 

the remaining non-cut off portion forms a connection tab (5) of 
height G above the pasted portion.
