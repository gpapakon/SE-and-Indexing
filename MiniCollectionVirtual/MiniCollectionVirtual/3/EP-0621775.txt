<ABSTRACT>
Described are pellets containing peptide drugs incorporated in a matrix consisting of gelatin or fractionated gelatin and plasticizers, the pellets having a semi-solid to gel-like consistency. Such drug forms exhibit, after application, bioadhesive properties and, by virtue of the matrix materials specified, allow or enhance the resorption of the peptide drug by the body.
