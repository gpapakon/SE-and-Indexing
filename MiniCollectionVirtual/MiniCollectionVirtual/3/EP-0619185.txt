<CLAIMS>
Device for the production of a sleeve (17, 35, 46), 
in particular a sleeve-shaped printing forme, having a 

continuous peripheral surface formed from a plate 
(9, 12, 40) with a dowel hole system, characterised in 

that for both plate edges to be joined there is 
respectively provided a retaining bar (5, 6; 26, 27; 

41, 42) which can be set longitudinally in an initial 
position and placed onto the respective edge of the 

plate (9, 22, 40), the retaining bars (5, 6; 26, 27; 
41, 42) have a pin register (10, 23, 48) which is 

designed so that the pins can co-operate with the dowel 
hole system of the plate (9, 22, 40), in that means 

(11, 28, 45) are assigned to at least one of the 
retaining bars (6, 27, 42) for effecting a rotation 

about an axis parallel to its longitudinal axis, and 
in that by means of this rotation the retaining bars 

(5, 6; 26, 27; 41, 42) can be placed opposite each 
other in such a way that the plate edges to be joined, 

which are fixed to the bars (5, 6; 26, 27; 41, 42), are 
in contact and can be joined, thus forming a sleeve 

(17, 35, 46). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the retaining bars (5, 6), spaced apart from each other 

in the initial position, can be fixed in approximately 
one plane on holding means (1, 2) which can be 

positioned according to the size of the plate, below 
this there is provided a sliding table (8) on which the 

plate (9) to be formed can be laid, both retaining bars 
(5, 6) can be lowered onto the plate (9) by means of 

lifting elements (4) on the holding means (1, 2), and 
the plate edges to be joined can be fixed true-to-register 

on the bars (5, 6) by means of the pin  
 

register (10) and the dowel hole system with 
simultaneous release from the holding means (1, 2), one 

of the retaining bars (5) can be moved transversely 
along the sliding table (8) at least over the length of 

the plate, the other retaining bar (6) together with 
the plate edge fixed on it can be positioned on a 

rotatably mounted cylinder (11) so that with a complete 
rotation of the cylinder (11) the plate (9) surrounds 

it and the retaining bars (5, 6) for joining the plate 
edges are opposite each other (Fig. 1), and the second 

bar (5) together with the plate edge fixed on it can be 
positioned in this position by means of a third holding 

means (3) on the cylinder (11). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the retaining bar (5) to be moved over the sliding 

table (8) is designed as a carriage, this carriage can 
be pulled along the table (8) in a sliding guideway by 

means of an endless transport chain (14), which is 
guided over cam rollers (15), and can be brought back 

into its initial position (Fig. 1). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that 
in the case of the cylinder (11) a dia
meter, variable 
by means of a cam (16), can be set. 
Device acording to claim 2 and 3, characterised in 
that the endless transport chain guideway is guided 

over the cylinder (11) and maintains a spacing of at 
least the length of the pins (10) from it. 
Device according to claim 2 to 4, characterised in 
that the retaining bar (5) is resiliently mounted on 

both sides in sliding rails. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterised in that the cylinder (11) is 
eccentrically mounted with respect to its drive (19). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the retaining bars (26, 27), spaced apart from each 

other in the initial position, can be fixed in an 
approximately horizontal plane on holding means (20, 

21) positionable according to the plate size, the plate 
edges to be joined can be secured true-to-register on 

the fixed bars (26, 27) by means of the pin register 
(23) and the dowel hole system, in that one of the bars 

(27) together with the plate edge fixed on it can be 
positioned on a rotatably mounted cylinder (28) by 

means of lifting elements (25) (sic) on its holding 
means (21) with simultaneous release from the holding 

means (21), whilst the other bar (26) remains on its 
holding means (20) together with the plate edge fixed 

on it, in that the cylinder (28) can be moved below and 
parallel to the plane in which the bars (26, 27) are 

disposed in the initial position, so that with a 
complete rotation of the cylinder (28) it moves under 

the plate (22), the plate encloses it, the retaining 
bars (26, 27) for joining the plate edges are opposite 

each other (Fig. 3), and in this position of the 
cylinder (28) the second bar (26) can be positioned on 

the cylinder (28) together with the plate edge fixed on 
it. 
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the cylinder (28) has a somewhat smaller circumference 

than the respective length of the plate (22) to be 
processed. 
Device according to claim 8 and 9, characterised 
in that the cylinder (28) can be moved by means of 

drive pinions (30) and toothed rack (32) with  
 

simultaneous rotation. 
Device according to claim 8 to 10, characterised 
in that the cylinder (28) is eccentrically mounted with 

respect to its drive (31). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the cylinders (11, 28) have a 

flattened shoulder (18, 36) for positioning the plate 
edges. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
for the plate edges to be joined there are provided a 

fixedly arranged retaining bar (41) and a retaining bar 
(42) located on a lever element (45) arranged rotatably 

and transversely movably, and the plate edges can be 
positioned on the bars (41, 42) in such a way that with 

a complete rotation and simultaneous transverse 
shifting (Fig. 6) of the lever element (45) in the 

direction of the fixed bar (41) the bars (41, 42) are 
opposite each other for joining the plate edges, 

forming a sleeve (46), the bars (41, 42) retaining the 
plate edges from the inside of the sleeve (46) 

(Fig. 5). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the retaining bars (5, 6; 26, 27; 

41, 42) are constructed as suction bars with integrated 
vacuum suction devices (47) distributed with a small 

spacing over the entire length. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that when using magnetisable plates 

the retaining bars (5, 6; 26, 27; 41, 42) are 
constructed as magnetic attraction bars for force-fitting 

connection to the plate edges.
