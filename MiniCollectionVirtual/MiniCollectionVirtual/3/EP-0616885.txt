<CLAIMS>
Matt, double- or multi-layer, biaxially stretched polypropylene films
comprising an outer matt layer M, a core layer K and optionally additional

layers S which are adjacent to the core layer on the side opposite to the matt
layer, wherein the matt layer M has a layer thickness of from 0.5 to 5.0 µm

and is composed of a polymer mixture of components comprising

25 - 75%
of one or more polypropylene-polyethylene block
copolymers,
5 - 15 %
of an ethylene-based co- or terpolymer modified with
polar groups,
15 - 40 %
of a random co- and/or terpolymer produced from
propylene/ethylene/butylene with propylene as the main

component,
5 - 20 %
of a high density polyethylene and
0 - 5%
of a natural or synthetic hydrated silica,

wherein the aforementioned components are used in their state as delivered
and/or in the form of batches therefrom,

the core layer K

   comprises a thermoplastic polymer and/or copolymer of propylene
which may be provided with conventional slip agents, antistatic agents

and/or anti-seizing agents,

layers S,

   which are adjacent to the core layer on the side opposite the matt layer,

comprise either a thermoplastic polypropylene,
 
   which may be provided with conventional slip agents, antistatic agents

and/or anti-seizing agents,

and/or a thermoplastic random copolymer

   of polypropylene with one or more α-olefines containing 2 to 6 carbon
atoms, which may be provided with conventional slip agents, antistatic

agents and/or anti-seizing agents,

or a layer which can be heat laminated,

   composed of mixtures of ethylene-based copolymers,

or a layer combination of the above-mentioned layers S.
A film according to claim 1, characterised in that the polypropylene of the
core layer consists of an isotactic polypropylene with a fraction which is

soluble in n-heptane of 6 % by weight or less.
A film according to claims 1 - 2, characterised in that the polypropylene-polyethylene
block copolymer contained in the matt layer has an ethylene

content of 6-8 % by weight and a melt flow index of 3-6 g/10 min (DIN
53735).
A film according to claims 1 - 3, characterised in that the co- or (ter)polymer
contained in the matt layer consists of propylene/ethylene/(butylene) and has a

propylene content of more than 80 % and a melt flow index of 3-6 g/10 min
(DIN 53735).
A film according to claims 1 - 4, characterised in that the high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) contained in the matt layer has a melt flow index of 1-2

g/10 min (DIN 53735). 
A film according to claims 1 - 5, characterised in that the ethylene-based co-
or terpolymer which is modified with polar groups and which is contained in

the matt layer has a melt flow index of 3-8 g/10 min (DIN 53735 at 190°C).
A process for producing the films according to claims 1 - 6, characterised in
that the melts corresponding to the individual layers of the film are coextruded

through a sheet die, the coextruded film is subjected to cooling on
corresponding rolls for solidification, the film is stretched by a factor of 4-5 in a

longitudinal direction at a temperature of 100-130°C and is stretched by a factor
of 8-9 in a transverse direction at a temperature of 150-170°C, the biaxially

stretched film is thermofixed, pretreated with a corona discharge and is
subsequently rolled up.
A process according to claim 7, characterised in that an additional layer can be
applied between the longitudinal stretching step and the transverse stretching

step, by melt coating or by film lamination.
Use of the film according to any one of claims 1 - 6 as a packaging film.
Use of the film according to any one of claims 1 - 6 for the finishing of printed
graphics products, wherein the matt side does not face the printed product.
A film according to claim 1, characterised in that a UV-curable clear lacquer is
applied to the matt side.
