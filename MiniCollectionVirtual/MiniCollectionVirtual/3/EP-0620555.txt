<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device maintains data utilizing a 
ferroelectric memory, not requiring a backup power 

source voltage. Data such as schedule data and telephone 
number data is stored in a ferroelectric RAM (16) 

which switches between a dynamic mode and a nonvolatile 
mode. When a clock mode is designated by a "CLK" key 

(12a), a memory control circuit (17) causes the 
ferroelectric RAM (16) to be switched to the nonvolatile 

mode to maintain the data stored therein. When a 
schedule mode or a telephone mode is designated by means 

of a "Sch" key (12b) or a "Tel" key (12c), the 

ferroelectric RAM (16) is switched to the nonvolatile 
mode to write/read data therein/therefrom. When it is 

detected that a battery voltage is lowered or the battery 
is removed from the electronic device, the 

ferroelectric RAM (16) is switched to the nonvolatile 
mode to protect the stored data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic device having a ferroelectric memory which can
switch between a dynamic mode and a nonvolatile mode, and more particularly to a
mode switch control in the memory, as set forth in the preamble of claim 1 or claim 4,
respectively. An electronic device of this kind is known from DE-A-4119248.The aforementioned document discloses a large scale integrated nonvolatile semi-conductor
memory circuit comprising a dynamic RAM, a capacitor having a
ferroelectric dielectric and a transistor serving as a switch for charging and
discharging said capacitor. The circuit comprises means that enable the dynamic
RAM which inherently is volatile to be used as a nonvolatile memory by adding said
transistor and the capacitor having the ferroelectric dielectric. The state of the
dynamic RAM i.e. whether volatile or nonvolatile, is controlled by the transistor.From HP100LX users guide, March 1993, Hewlett-Packard Corporation (XP2021386),
an electronic notebook is known which is capable of executing a number of functions.
It comprises an RAM disk used just like a hard disk of a PC and which is a nonvolatile
memory. This notebook may be equipped with memory cards to expand data and
program storage. The notebook comprises a main battery and a back-up battery.
Volatile data are saved when replacing the batteries if the batteries are replaced one
after the other. Conventionally, notebooks
memorize personal schedules, and the addresses and telephone
numbers of acquaintances.
An electronic notebook stores data in a semi-conductor
memory by means of key-input operation and
reads data from the memory, and can display it on a display
section, if necessary.In the electronic notebook, data is stored in a RAM
such as a DRAM (dynamic RAM) or a SRAM (static RAM),
which is incorporated in the electronic notebook or in a
card serving as an external memory medium. A backup
voltage is supplied to the RAM to maintain the stored
data, even if the power source is turned off or the card
is removed from the electronic notebook. A cell or a
battery is generally used as the power source for an
electronic device of this type. Therefore, if the cell
or battery is consumed over a long period of time, the
backup voltage cannot be supplied to the RAM and the
data in the RAM will be lost. To prevent this, some
conventional electronic devices have an alarm function
for informing the user, by means of the display or the 
buzzer, that the cell or battery needs to be exchanged,
when the power source voltage if reduced below

<CLAIMS>
An electronic device (10) comprising:

a ferroelectric memory (16) switchable between two memory modes including a
dynamic memory mode in which data can be written and read out and a

nonvolatile memory mode in which storage data can be retained without supply of
power; characterized by further comprising:
a switch (SW(B)) operated when a battery (B) is taken out and replaced with
another; and
switching means (10), operating in response to the switch (SW(B)) being
operated, for switching the ferroelectric memory (16) from the dynamic memory

mode to the nonvolatile memory mode, and vice versa.
An electronic device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said switch
(SW(B)) is operated in association with an operation of opening or closing a

battery lid of a battery storage section.
An electronic device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said switching
means (10) includes signal generation means for supplying a chip enable

signal (CE) and a switching signal (D/NV) to the ferroelectric memory (16) when
the memory modes are switched from one to the other, said chip enable signal

(CE) being a pulse signal that becomes active for a predetermined length of time.
