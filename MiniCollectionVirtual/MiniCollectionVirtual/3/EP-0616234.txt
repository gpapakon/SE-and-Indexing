<ABSTRACT>
A polyimide optical waveguide comprising a core (2) 
made of polyimide whose refractive index is controlled 

to a predetermined value by electron beam irradiation, 
and a cladding (1, 3) set in contact with the core and 

having a refractive index lower than that of the core. 
A polyamic acid solution is spin-coated on a substrate such as of 
silicon, and is thermally cured to form a polyimide layer. An electron 

beam is irradiated on the entire surface of the polyimide layer to change 
the refractive index to a predetermined value. An electron beam-absorbed 

dose of the polyimide layer depends on the composition of the polyimide, 
an energy of the electron beam, and the applied amount of the electron 

beam irradiation. The refractive index changes in accordance therewith 
approximately. 
This polyimide layer irradiated with the electron beam is used as a 
core layer. 
Next, the same polyamic acid solution is spin-coated on the core 
layer, and is thermally cured. The material is separated from the 

substrate to obtain a polyimide film of a two-layer structure. 
Then, the polyimide film of a two-layer structure is made to reverse 
and the irradiated polyimide layer is made to the upper surface. The 

lower surface of the reversed film is adhered by a method such as a 
thermo-compression bonding on the other silicon substrate. 
 
Next, the core layer is patterned into a desired shape, for example, 
a rectangular shape, by RIE (reactive ion etching) method. 
Finally, the same polyamic acid solution is spin-coated over the 
patterned core layer, as an upper cladding lacer, and is thermally 

cured, thereby preparing an embedded channel waveguide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a polyimide optical
waveguide, and more particularly to a method of manufacturing a polyimide
optical waveguide comprising a core made of polyimide and a cladding which contacts with
the core and has a refractive index lower than that of the core.As an optical communication system is put to
practical, thanks to the development of a low loss optical
fiber, it is desired that various kinds of devices
for the optical communication be developed. Further,
there are demands for an optical wiring technique, more
particularly an optical waveguide technique by which
the optical devices are packaged in high density.Generally, some conditions are required of an optical
waveguide, for example, low optical losses, facile
fabrication, controllable core-cladding refractive index
ratio, and a high heat resistance.As material of the optical waveguide having low
optical losses, a silica-based material can be cited.
As already proved in optical fiber, silica which has a
good optical transmittance achieves an optical loss of
0.1 dB/cm or less at wavelength of 1.3 Âµm, if used in an
optical waveguide. Manufacture of quartz glass optical
waveguides, however, presents a number of problems
including a manufacturing processes lengthy in terms of 
time, the high temperatures needed during fabrication,
and the difficulty of making optical waveguides with a
large area.To solve these problems, attempts have been made
to produce optical waveguides using plastics such as
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which can be manufactured
at low temperatures and low cost. Conventional plastic
optical waveguides, however, have low resistance to
high temperature. Thus, there is a demand for
plastic optical waveguide having an excellent heat
resistance.Among the various organic polymers currently
available, polyimides provide very high resistance to
heat. Hence, these materials have been widely employed
in the field of electronics, to form an insulating film
between layers in the multilayer wiring or to form a
flexible print board. However, there has been no example
in which polyimide is applied for an optical device
such as an optical waveguide.In view of this, the inventors of the present
invention have studied and developed a polyimide optical
material which is applicable for an optical waveguide.
When polyimide is used in optical communication applications
as the optical material, there are two important
points. First, its transparency in the visible and near
infrared regions is
