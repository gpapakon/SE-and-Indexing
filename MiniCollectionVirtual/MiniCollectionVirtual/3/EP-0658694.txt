<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a clip for fastening onto an elongate element such as a rod (shank). This clip, preferably made of spring steel, is U-shaped in its base (2), from which two tongues (3) are cut, each tongue originating at the base (6) of one branch (1) of the U, while the facing free ends (3a) of the tongues 3 define between them a space (4) for the passage of a rod (shank) when the clip is compressed and for hooking the tongues (3) onto the shank when the clip is released. This clip makes it possible, for example, to join together two components through which a rod or a stud passes.

<CLAIMS>
Clip for fastening onto an elongated element such as a shank or the like
(5) comprising an elastically deformable U-shaped part constituted by

two substantially parallel legs (1) and a base (2) formed of two cut-out
small tongues (3) defining a space (4) therebetween for the passage of

the shank (5), characterized in that in the sides of the small tongues (3)
forming the base (2) of the U are cut out two arms (7) which have their

root like the small tongues (3) at the base portion (6) of the legs (1) of
the U and which are bent so as to form on either side of the small

tongues (3) a dihedron with an edge (7a) turned towards the open
portion of the U, which arms (7) impart to the clip the desired elasticity

and returning properties respectively during the compression of the free
ends of the legs (1) to permit the passage of the shank (5) between the

mutually confronting ends (3a) of the small tongues (3) and during the
release of the legs (1) for ensuring the hooking of the small tongues (3)

onto the shank (5).
Clip according to claim 1, characterized in that in the non-use and rest
position of the clip, both aforesaid small tongues (3) are located

substantially in a same plane which is substantially orthogonal to the
plane of each leg (1) of the U.
Clip according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the free
ends (3a) of the small tongues (3) exhibit an arcuate shape adapted to

co-operate with the periphery of the shank (5).
Clip according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the free ends
(8) of the legs (1) of the U of the part are bent outwards.
