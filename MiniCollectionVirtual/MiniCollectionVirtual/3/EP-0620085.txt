<ABSTRACT>
Release safety device for a driving tool, with a working cylinder, a driving ram fixed to the working piston, a control valve arrangement for piston movement to the bottom dead centre and to the top dead centre, a piston return chamber connected to the working cylinder via a first opening close to the bottom dead centre and a second opening at a distance from the bottom dead centre, a mouth tool with a driving channel, with an opening to a magazine, a feeling device with a feeling head displaceable in the setting-on direction and feeling slide coupled thereto with a bearing surface transverse to its displacement direction, a release for displacing the valve rod with a pivotable valve lever and an operating lever fixed thereto, the free end of the operating lever being supported by the bearing surface before actuation of the feeling device and before actuation of the release, remaining supported by the bearing surface upon actuation of the feeling device and subsequent actuation of the release, with the result that the operating lever actuates the valve rod, and sliding off the bearing surface upon actuation of the release without actuation of the feeling device, without the operating lever displacing the valve rod, the feeling device being assigned a locking device which locks the feeling device upon actuation of the valve rod and unlocks the feeling device upon freeing of the valve rod.
