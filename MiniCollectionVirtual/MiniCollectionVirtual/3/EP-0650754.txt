<ABSTRACT>
A filter septum is constructed with a stainless steel sheet microscreen 
element which has uniformly distributed apertures through which a liquid to 

be filtered is passed from an inlet side to an exit side of the element. The 
apertures are preferably tapered from a larger diameter at the inlet side to 

a smaller diameter at the exit side of the microscreen element. A supporting 
metal base plate having rows of uniformly distributed holes which are larger 

then the apertures is brazed to the microscreen element bonding the exit side 
of the microscreen element to the inlet side of the base plate. Preferably 

the inlet side of the microscreen element is TeflonÂ® coated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filtration systems. More particularly, this
invention relates to a filter septum through which liquid to be filtered is
passed and the method of manufacturing this filter septum.The state of the prior art is accurately set forth in detail in a
technical paper entitled "MICROSCREEN FILTRATION
OF METALWORKING FLUIDS" presented and published in March 1993 by the Society
of Manufacturing Engineers. In this paper the term "microscreen" is defined
as a thin metallic sheet with small, uniform apertures or holes throughout.
This definition eliminates screens constructed of wire, plastic or synthetic
fiber. The advantages of microscreen septums are also presented, centering
around higher flux rates made possible by the ability to make the septum
aperture smaller, more closely spaced, and more accurately defined by
utilizing an electrochemical process in the manufacture of the microscreen.
This microscreen is an essential part of the present invention.As also presented in the above-mentioned paper, the difficulty
utilizing the advantages of microscreen lies in the fabrication of the filter
septum utilizing microscreen. Before the present invention, the most
successful use of microscreen has been in placing the microscreen over the
outside of a drum of perforated plate by wrapping and clamping the
microscreen in position. The difficulties encountered in using only
mechanical clamping to secure the microscreen to a perforated substrate or
base plate are obvious even in the more successful use in drums and cylinders
where often doctor blades are used for scraping and cleaning or pressure
swings are used for backflow regeneration. With planar septum configurations
the problems can be exasperated.The referred to technical paper then presents an improvement to the
mechanical clamping fabrication in the form of brazing or "fuse bonding" the
microscreen to the base plate support. This innovative bonding fabrication 
like the electrochemical production of the microscreen is also an essential
part of the present invention.The present invention is thus directed to a filter septum
according to claim 1 and a method of producing a filter septum
according to claim 4.The filter septum of the invention comprises a metal sheet microscreen
element having uniformly distributed apertures through which a liquid to be
filtered is passed from an inlet side to an exit side of the element. The
apertures are formed in the element by an electrochemical process
providing a taper in the aperture from a larger
