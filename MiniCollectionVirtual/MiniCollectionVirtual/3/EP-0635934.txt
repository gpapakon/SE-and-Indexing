<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
constant-amplitude wave combination type amplifier, and more
particularly to a constant-amplitude wave combination type
amplifier based on a LINC (linear amplification with non-linear
components) process.US-A-3 909 742 discloses an amplifier for linearly
amplifying a bandpass high frequency analog input signal by a
plurality of amplifying means including those having a non-linear
characteristic. These amplifying means include first
combining means for producing from the input signal first and
second signal components having constant amplitude but
differing in phase, first and second non-linear amplifiers for
separately amplifying said first and second component signals,
second combining means for recombining the amplified first and
second component signals output by said first and second
amplifiers, respectively, so as to generate an output signal
formed by the difference of said first and second amplified
component signals and being a linearly amplified replica of
the input signal, and to also generate a feedback signal being
the sum of said first and second amplified component signals
and fed to said first combining means for combining the input
and feedback signal.Moreover, constant-amplitude wave combination 
type amplifiers have been widely used in various
communication devices, such as radio devices for use in
mobile communications, multiple radio devices, satellite
communication radio devices, and broadcasting devices.
There is a need to realize such constant-amplitude wave
combination amplifiers which consume a small amount of
power and which are configured of a small number of
structural elements.Constant-amplitude wave combination type
amplifiers based on the LINC process are known as
amplifiers which meet the above-mentioned need, and are
disclosed in, for example, D.C. Cox, "Linear
Amplification with Non-linear Components", IEEE
Transactions on Communications, December 1974, pp.
1942-1945. An application of constant-amplitude wave
combination type amplifiers based on the LINC process is
proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
1-284106.FIG.1 shows a conventional constant-amplitude
wave combination type amplifier. As shown, the
amplifier has a constant-amplitude wave operation
circuit 61, two amplifiers 62 and 63, and a wave
combining circuit 64. The constant-amplitude wave
operation circuit 61 is formed of a digital signal
processing circuit, and calculates an orthogonal wave Y
orthogonal to an input wave X so that each combined wave
