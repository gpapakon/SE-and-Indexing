<ABSTRACT>
The fastening element comprises an anchor bolt (1) and an expansion wedge (2), which is provided, in a first end region (6), with a flange-like attachment part (5) for absorbing loads, which attachment part exhibits a through-passage bore (3) for the expansion wedge (2). Arranged in a second end region (7), of the anchor bolt (1), located opposite the first end region (6) is a wedge surface (4) which, towards the free end of the second end region (7), comes closer to the peripheral contour of the anchor bolt (1). In order to expand the fastening element in a prefabricated receiving bore, the expansion wedge (2) is displaced axially with respect to the wedge surface (4) arranged on the anchor bolt (1). In order, before the expansion, to achieve automatic retention of the fastening element in receiving bores, the expansion wedge (2) is designed in the form of an arc, with the result that it bears on the anchor bolt (1) only in the first end region (6) and in the second end region (7).

Fastening element with anchor bolt (1) and 
expansion wedge (2), the anchor bolt (1) being provided, 

in a first end region (6), with a flange-like application 

part (5) which is intended for taking up loads and 
exhibits a through-passage bore (3) for the expansion 

wedge (2) and having, in a second end region (7) located 
opposite the first end region (6), a wedge surface (4) 

which, towards the free end of the second end region (7), 
comes closer to the circumferential contour of the anchor 

bolt (1) and along which the expansion wedge (2) can be 
displaced for expansion purposes, and the expansion wedge 

(2), in the non-expanded state of the fastening element, 
being in connection with the wall of the through-passage 

bore (3) of the flange-like application part (5), characterized 
in that the expansion wedge (2) is designed in 

the form of an arc in the longitudinal direction, such 
that, in the non-expanded state, it rests merely on the 

first end region (6) and second end region (7) of the 
anchor bolt (1). 
Fastening element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the arcuate design of the expansion wedge 

(2) extends at least over half the length of the expansion 
wedge (2). 
Fastening element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the greatest clearance (S), resulting due 

to the arcuate design, between the anchor bolt (1) and 
the expansion wedge (2) is from 0.2 to 1.5 mm.
