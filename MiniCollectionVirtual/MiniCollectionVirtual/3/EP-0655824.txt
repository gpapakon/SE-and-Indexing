member formed of a sheet metal by press-working and having a 

first central bearing receiver also formed by press-working in 
the form of generally hollow cylinder; a second housing member

first bearing receiver of the first housing member and another 
end for receiving the stator on the outer surface of the stator 

support; a magnets support press-worked from a electrical steel 
sheet metal for sup
porting magnets around the stator and inside

receiver coaxially with the first bearing; and a freely rotatable 

shaft mounted on the first and second bearings, for firmly

production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to outer rotor type brushless DC motor
for use with household electric appliances.Present household electric appliances mostly utilize electric
motors. Take for example a light-weight duty air air-conditioning
system, which utilizes motors for an indoor side heat exchanger
as well as an out-door side heat exchanger. These motors
generally have output powers in the range of few Watts to tens of
Watts, and most of them are brushless DC motors for their high
power efficiency.An example of such DC motor is an outer rotor type DC motor,
as disclosed in Japanese Utility Publications 63-16297, which
comprises a stator made up of a multiplicity of coils wound on
respective teeth and a rotor having magnets surrounding the stator.
Another type of such DC motor is an inner rotor type DC motor,
which has a rotor installed inside a stator, as disclosed in
Japanese Utility Publication 63-34449.In order to manufacture compact air-conditioners, it is very
important to provide them with fan motors small in size, wherein
the size of a motor is given by the following formula: T= 2 x L x D
, where T is the output torque of the motor; L is the total
thickness of the multiple teeth; and D is the inner diameter of 
an air gap between the rotor and the stator of the motor.Consequently, in order to obtain high-output power under a
given output torque requirement, the inner air gap D should be as
large as possible. Thus, outer rotor type motors generally having
larger air gaps D than inner rotor type motors, are superior to
the latter type. This in turn implies that for a give output an
outer rotor type motor may have less thickens than corresponding
inner type motor. A further advantage of outer rotor type motors
is that in winding coils it is much easier to work with outer
rotors than with inner type rotors, requiring much fewer
assembling processes.A typical outer rotor type brushless motors has a stator
molded in a thermally cured resin to reduce vibrations and noises
that can arise from lose contacts of elements involved, as
discussed in Japanese Patent Early Publication 4-236155.However, such outer rotor type brushless DC motors are
usually difficult to dismantle once it is molded in resin and
thermally cured. Thus, defective motors such as those having
manufacturing flaws or deteriorated by aging have been disposed
in ground, without removing their stators. This can cause,
however, serious environmental hazards. Moreover, their
manufacture requires a large number of molding installations to
meet
