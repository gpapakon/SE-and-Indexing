<ABSTRACT>
It comprises a body (1), a rotation spindle (shaft) (2) and a hand wheel (4) which are made of steel, a lower wear piece (6) with a U-shaped housing (43) and an upper wear piece (5), of which the face (50) which contacts the winding bar is planar, it being possible for the said wear pieces (5, 6) to be secured to the hand wheel (4) in the case of the upper wear piece (5) and to the end (21) of the spindle (2) in the case of the lower wear piece (6), by screwing from in front; the hand wheel (4) being mounted so that it can pivot, on the end (21) of the rotation spindle (2), about two partially screw-threaded stepped spindles (40) which are screwed into the hand wheel (4) at the latter's periphery, and the non screw-threaded parts (42) of which are inserted into holes (30) made in the said end (21) of the rotation spindle (2).

<CLAIMS>
Bearing for supporting one end of a winding bar for winding or unwinding
webs of material and comprising a body (1), a rotational axis (2), a seat (3) able to be

closed off via the movement of a steering wheel (4), as well as two expendable parts (5,
6), one lower expendable part (6) with a U-shaped housing (60) able to be rendered

integral by screwing at the end (21) of the axis (2), and an upper expendable part (5)
whose face (50) for making contact with the winding bar is flat, said bearing being

firstly characterised in that said body (1) rotational axis (2) and steering wheel (4) are
made of steel, and secondly in that the upper expendable part (5) has an L-shaped

section whose face not in contact with the winding bar is rendered integral via screwing
to the steering wheel (4) in a rabbet (44) fitted in the upper edge of a housing (43) made

in said steering wheel (4) and intended to house the end (21) of the axis (2).
Bearing according to claim 1, characterised in that the lower expendable part
(6) comprises on both sides of the U-shaped housing (60) projecting portions (64) for

covering the upper expendable part (5, 105).
Bearing according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the rear portion (63) of
the lower expendable part (6) able to be adapted to the end (21) of the axis (2), as well

as the seat (3) for receiving said rear portion (63), are cylindrical and concentric to the
axis (2).
Bearing according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
locking of the steering wheel (4) on the end (21) of the axis (2) is ensured by a ball (7)

introduced into an orifice moved out of centre (46) made in the steering wheel (4) and
projecting opposite an orifice (51) pierced in the upper expendable part (5) and, when

the steering wheel is in a closed position, is disposed opposite a cavity (32) made to the
upper face of the end (21) of the axis (2, the ball (7) being supported by a spring (70)

and a screw (71) screwed into the orifice (46) which is partially threaded.
Bearing according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
bearing body (1) internally comprises an internal shoulder (13). 
Bearing according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
steering wheel (4) is mounted pivoting on the end (21) of the rotational axis (2) around

two shouldered axes (40) and partially threaded and screwed into the steering wheel (4)
at the periphery of the latter and whose non-threaded portions (42) are introduced into

orifices (30) made in said end (21) of the rotational axis (2).
