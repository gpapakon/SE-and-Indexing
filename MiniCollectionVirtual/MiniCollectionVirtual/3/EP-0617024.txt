<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to the use of 5-aminophthaloylhydrazide
of the formula

and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts for the manufacture
of a medicament.The present invention pertains to indications of the
pharmacological effectiveness of a significant group of compounds
consisting of phthaloylhydrazide* derivatives with the following
general formula:
Certain derivatives of 5-aminophthaloylhydrazide have been
used as chemical reagents in biochemical analysis. Practical
applications for certain other derivatives, namely 2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-dione,
the sodium salt of 4-amino-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,2-dione,
the sodium salt of 5-amino-1,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,2-dione,
4,3-diamino-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,2-dione
have not been identified, nor have salts of the
previously indicated compounds been used.In the FR-1 182 224 phthaloylhydrazide derivatives are disclosed.
In the FR-2 490 074 the use of phthaloylhydrazide derivatives
as plant growing promoters is disclosed. In the WO-82 
00641, finally, acyl derivatives of luminol or isoluminol
are disclosed and its use in relation with a method in laboratory
diagnostics of proteases.Attempts to use 2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-dione and certain
derivatives for reducing serum cholesterol levels (J.H. Hall et
al., "Effect of 2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-dione on Sprague-Dawley
Rats' Lipid Metabolism and Serum Lipoproteins," Biomed.
Biochem. Acta V, 47 (4-5), pp. 423-433, 1988) by modifying levels
of lipids with extremely low densities have occurred.It was determined, however, that this particular compound was
relatively toxic when it was administered in doses of 20 mg/kg,
although it did display an extremely high level of activity.
Nevertheless, the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of
derivatives belonging to this group of compounds have not been
recognized and have not been described within medical literature.For the first time, it has been possible to demonstrate
phthaloylhydrazides' original and unique mode of action which,
instead of emerging from analysis of their chemical properties,
only became evident from invivo administration of these
compounds.In the GB-1100911 certain phthalazine derivatives are disclosed
which possess antiinflammatory properties. Pharmacological
testing of compounds belonging to the phthaloylhydrazide
group and salts of these compounds allowed identification of
5-amino-phthaloylhydrazide as the compound offering the most
significant therapeutic effectiveness, and it is wholly non-toxic
in situations where acceptable
