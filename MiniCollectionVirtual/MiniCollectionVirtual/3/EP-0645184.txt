<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst including silica and an acidic phase comprising sulphuric acid and the compound HB(HSO4)4, the silica having been impregnated with the said acidic phase, the said catalyst being such that it consists essentially of particles with a mean diameter of between 0.1 and 30  mu m, such that, before it is impregnated with the said acidic phase, the silica has a total pore volume of between 0.1 and 0.6 cm

>
/g, and such that the said acidic phase includes between 0.4 % and 68.8 % by weight of the compound HB(HSO4)4 and between 31.2 % and 99.6 % by weight of the compound H2SO4, the said acidic phase being characterised in that it does not contain any sulphur trioxide or boric acid. The invention also relates to the preparation and use of the said catalyst in catalytic alkylation of isobutane and/or isopentane in the presence of at least one olefin containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule.

, the silica having been 
impregnated with said acid phase and said catalyst being such that 

it is composed substantially of particles with an average diameter 
of between 0.1 and 30 µm, such that the silica, prior to its 

impregnation with said acid phase, has a total porous volume of 
between 0.1 and 6 cm

 per gram, in that said acid phase contains 
(in % by weight) between 0.4% and 68.8% of the compound 

HB(HSO

SO
4
, said acid phase being characterised by the fact that it does 
not contain sulphuric anhydride or boric acid. 
Catalyst according to claim 1 such that it is essentially constituted 
by particles of average diameter of between 5 and 30 µm. 
Catalyst according to one of claims 1 or 2 such that the content by 
weight of acid phase of said catalyst is between 1 and 40%. 
Preparation of the catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 3 
containing at least two stages, the first stage being such that the 

silica is calcined at a temperature greater than 50°C for a duration 
of between 10 minutes and 50 hours, and the second stage being  

 
such that said calcined silica is impregnated by said acid phase. 
Preparation according to claim 4 in which the compound HB(HSO
4
)
4
 
is obtained by reacting 1 mol of boric acid with 3 mols of sulphuric 

anhydride and 1 mol of sulphuric acid. 
Use of the catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 3 or prepared 
according to one of claims 4 or 5 in catalytic alkylation of at least 

one isoparaffin selected from the group formed by isobutane and 
isopentane in the presence of at least one olefin containing 3 to 6 

carbon atoms per molecule, in which the reaction temperature is 
lower than +10°C and the pressure of the reaction zone is sufficient 

to maintain the hydrocarbons in liquid state in said zone. 
Use according to claim 6 in which the catalyst is used in a near-perfect 
mix reaction zone. 
Use according to claim 6 in which the catalyst is used in a co-flow 
fluidised bed.
