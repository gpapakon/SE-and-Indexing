<ABSTRACT>
A method of delivering a cytotoxic compound to a cancer cell and getting the compound inside the cancer cell using a plasminogen material such as a plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). The toxic compound is coupled to PAI-1 to form a reaction product that is coupled with urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) that is bound to the cell surface by uPA receptors (uPAR). The resultant complex is internalized to enter the cancer cell to deliver the cytotxic compound within the cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a use of a cytotoxic material coupled to plasminogen
activator inhibitor material for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer
cells containing a Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) bound to the surface by uPA
receptor, characterised in that the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is PMI-1 or PAI-2, or
recombinant forms or derivatives thereof, bound to a carrier.Cytostatic drugs have been in clinical use as
anticancer agents. Cytotoxic or cytostatic compounds such
as methotrexate, dexorubicin, cis-platinum and others have
high cytotoxicity but generally have low target
selectivity (low efficiency in hitting the cancer cell
target).In modern oncology there is a consensus that the
trend of development of therapeuticals shifts increasingly
from the emphasis on the maximal cytotoxicity toward the
maximal selectivity. Cytostatic drugs have been in a
clinical use as anticancer agents for about half a century
now. Over the years, a number of cytotoxic or cytostatic
compounds have been developed and clinically applied in
tumor therapy (methotrexate, dexorubicin, cis-platinum and 
others). The listed above agents have in common their
high cytotoxicity, though their therapeutic efficacy is
limited by their relatively low target selectivity. Only
the fact, that the tumor cells grow and metabolize a lot
faster than most healthy tissues, makes chemotherapy of
tumor work at all.Around the turn of the century, Paul Ehrlich first
propagated the idea of targeted drug delivery. He
referred to targeted drug as a magic bullet that would
seek out its target and hit there only without damaging
any other tissue. If one can make the cytostatic compound
more tumor specific by this method, one would
automatically increase the therapeutic index and thus the
efficacy of the treatment. It is therefore no surprise
that the antibody-drug conjugates were and are considered
a possible way to increase drastically selectivity of the
treatment. There is, so far, no magic bullet-like target
seeking ability for the antibody; the only way an antibody
reaches its target is by passive transport with blood or
lymphatic fluid, However, an antibody does not actively
seeks its target, the only reason to use it in
localization on the target cells is the high affinity
constant of the antibody-antigen reaction. Thus, the
dilution effects, accessibility of a tumor location by
these fluids, and unspecific Fc receptor binding (in the
liver) diminish the amount of immunoconjugates reaching
