<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process of producing chlorine 
dioxide comprising the steps: Providing a reactor with an 

aqueous acidic reaction medium containing alkali metal 
chlorate and sulfate, wherein the concentration of sulfate 

exceeds about 3 moles/liter but is less than saturation; 
reducing chlorate ions in said reaction medium to form 

chlorine dioxide; withdrawing chlorine dioxide gas from the 
reaction medium; withdrawing reaction medium from the reactor 

and transferring it to an electrochemical cell; electrolysing 
said reaction medium to increase the acidity and decrease the 

content of alkali metal ions; recycling the acidified reaction 
medium to the reactor; adding make up alkali metal chlorate to 

the reaction medium before or after the electrochemical cell; 
wherein the process is performed substantially without 

crystallisation of sulfate or chlorate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of producing 
chlorine dioxide. The process comprises reducing chlorate in 
an acidic reaction medium and circulating generator solution 
between a chlorine dioxide generator and an electrochemical 
cell. The process is performed without crystallisation of 
sulfate and without formation of any solid by-products. Chlorine dioxide used in aqueous solution is of considerable 
commercial interest, mainly in pulp bleaching, but 
also in water purification, fat bleaching, removal of phenols 
from industrial wastes etc. It is therefore desirable to 
provide processes in which chlorine dioxide can be efficiently 
produced. There are numerous different processes for chlorine 
dioxide production. Most processes in commercial use involves 
reaction of sodium chlorate in an acidic medium with a 
reducing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, methanol, chloride 
ions or sulfur dioxide. The acidity is generally provided by 
sulfuric acid. A drawback of the known processes is the 
formation of some form of sodium sulfate as a by-product which 
has to be removed from the reactor, either in the form of a 
solid saltcake or as waste acid. Most modern processes are 
operated under subatmospheric pressure, involving precipitation 
of the sodium sulfate as a saltcake which has to be 
removed from the reactor by filtering. Today it is hard to 
find any use for the salt cake and it is normally regarded as 
an unwanted by-product. In order to avoid formation of a sulfate by-product, it 
has been disclosed to provide all acid needed for the chlorine 
dioxide generation from chloric acid which can be prepared 
electrochemically from sodium chlorate. Such methods are 
described in, for example, the US patents 4915927, 5084148 and 
5174868. However, it has been found difficult to achieve 
satisfactory current efficiency in production of strong 
chloric acid which is desirable in order provide efficient 
chlorine dioxide generation. US patent 4806215 discloses a process in which chlorine 
dioxide is generated from sodium chlorate and hydrochloric 
acid, in which process the generator liquor is acidified  
 
electrochemically and recycled back to the reactor. However, 
this process necessarily results in co-formation of chlorine 
which cannot be accepted in modern environmental friendly 
bleaching processes. US patent 4129484 discloses a process of producing 
chlorine dioxide in which process sulfuric acid and sodium 
hydrogen sulfate is withdrawn from the reactor and subjected 
to electrolysis.
