<ABSTRACT>
In an optical information medium having an
information bearing surface (21) having projections and

depressions and/or capable of forming recorded marks, a
functional layer is added (10). The information borne on the

information bearing surface can be read by using reading
light of a wavelength longer than 4NA·P
L
 wherein P
L
 is the
minimum size of the projections and depressions or the

recorded marks and NA is the numerical aperture of a
reading optical system, setting the power of the reading

light within such a range that the functional layer does
not change its complex index of refraction, and irradiating

the reading light to the information bearing surface
constructed by the functional layer or to the information

bearing surface through the functional layer or to the
functional layer through the information bearing surface.

The medium enables reading at a high resolution beyond the
diffraction limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical information
medium having a high recording density and a method for
reading information in the medium.Optical information media include read-only optical
discs such as compact discs, rewritable optical recording
discs such as magneto-optical recording discs and phase
change optical recording discs, and write-once optical
recording discs using organic dyes as the recording
material.In general, optical information media have a high
information density as compared with magnetic recording
media. The recent need to process a vast quantity of
information as in images requires to further increase the
recording density. The recording density per unit area can
be increased either by narrowing the track pitch or by
reducing the space or blank between recorded marks or
between phase pits to increase a line density. However, if
the track density or line density is too high relative to
the beam spot of reading light, the carrier-to-noise (C/N)
ratio lowers, eventually to a level where signals are
unreadable. The resolution upon signal readout is
determined by the diameter of a beam spot. More
illustratively, provided that the reading light has a
wavelength λ and the optical system of the reading
equipment has a numerical aperture NA, the readout limit is
generally given by a spatial frequency 2NA/λ. Accordingly,
reducing the wavelength of reading light and increasing the
NA are effective means for improving the C/N and resolution
upon readout. A number of technical studies that have been 
made thus far reveal that many technical problems must be
solved before such effective means can be introduced.Under the circumstances, several methods have been
proposed for going over the readout limit determined by
light diffraction. They are generally known as super-resolution
readout methods.The most common super-resolution readout method is to
form a mask layer over a recording layer. Based on the
fact that a laser beam defines a spot having an intensity
distribution approximate to the Gaussian distribution, an
optical aperture smaller than the beam spot is formed in
the mask layer whereby the beam spot is reduced below the
diffraction limit. This method is generally divided into a
heat mode and a photon mode, depending on the optical
aperture-forming mechanism.The heat mode is such that upon irradiation to a beam
spot, the mask layer changes its optical properties in a
region whose temperature is raised above a certain value.
The heat mode is utilized, for example, in the optical disc
disc
