<ABSTRACT>
The corner connection is intended to be configured such that the corner connector (1) is of low weight and, in the frame corner, a relatively small quantity of adhesive is sufficient in order to achieve a surface bonding between the corner connector (1) and the hollow profiles (21, 22), fixed on the corner connector, with a high shear strength. In order to achieve this object, the corner connector (1) exhibits inner chambers which are open towards its flank surfaces (7), the openings in the flank surfaces are closed by one or more covering bodies (11) or by filling bodies, and gaps defined by spacer pieces are provided between the flank surfaces and the inner delimitation surfaces of the hollow profiles (21, 22) in order to receive an injectable adhesive-bonding composition, the injection of the adhesive-bonding composition taking place after the mechanical fixing of the hollow profiles (21, 22) on the corner connector (1).

A corner connection of hollow profiles, which are cut on the 
mitre, of a frame for windows, doors or facades, comprising a corner 

connector which engages with its limbs into hollow chambers in the 
hollow profiles and with which the hollow profiles, with force-locking 

support in the mitre joint, can be braced by fixing means which can be 
formed in, driven into or screwed into receiving means of the corner 

connector, and adhesive material is provided between the inside 
surfaces of the hollow profiles and the corner connector, characterised 

in that the corner connector (1) has inner chambers (5, 6) which are 
opened to its flank surfaces (7) which extend parallel to the 

longitudinal central plane (8), the openings in the flank surfaces (7) 
are closed by one or more cover bodies (11) or by filling bodies (28, 

29), provided between the flank surfaces (7) and the inner boundary 
surfaces of the hollow profiles (21, 22) are gaps defined by spacer 

portions (15, 16) for receiving injectable adhesive material, and 
injection of the adhesive material is effected after mechanical fixing 

of the hollow profiles (21, 22) to the corner connector (1). 
A corner connection according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the corner connector (1) has boundary surfaces which are closed at the 

sides of the inner corner (9) and the outer corner (10). 
A corner connection according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the corner connector (1) is cut to length from an 

extruded profile (2). 
A corner connection according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the corner connector is provided with inner 

chambers (5, 6) which are opened at the end faces of the free ends of 
the limbs.  

 
A corner connection according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that in the region of the outer corner (10) the corner 

connector (1) has a flat (3) which together with the hollow profiles 
(21, 22) fixed to the corner connector defines a distribution passage 

(20) which extends over the entire height of the corner connector and 
into which opens, adjacent the mitre joint, an injection opening (19) 

for adhesive material, which is provided in a hollow profile (22). 
A corner connection according to claim 1 characterised in that 
provided for covering each flank side of the corner connector is a 

cover body (11) which is provided at the underside with shaped portions 
(12, 13) thereon and at the free ends with tongues (14) which engage 

into the hollow chambers (5, 6). 
A corner connection according to claim 6 characterised in that 
the tongues (14) extend inclinedly downwardly from the cover body (11). 
A corner connection according to claim 6 characterised in that a 
triangular spacer portion (15) is arranged at the top side of the cover 

body (11) in the region of the front corner (10) and a further spacer 
portion (16) associated with each limb defines adhesive surfaces of the 

flank surfaces of the corner connector. 
A corner connection according to claim 1 characterised in that 
shaped portions (28, 29), preferably of foam, are arranged in the inner 

chambers (5, 6). 
A corner connection according to claim 9 characterised in that 
said shaped portions (278, 29) project out of the flank openings and 

form spacer portions for the gaps.
