<ABSTRACT>
A self-purging fuel injector (10) for a combustor (C) of a 
gas turbine engine wherein the fuel injector comprises 

an injector body having first (122c) and second (142c) air discharge 
orifices for discharging air to the combustor and first (130,132) 

and second (150,163,162) fuel passage means having respective first 
(132c) and second (162c) fuel discharge orifices for discharging fuel 

to the combustor. The first and second fuel passages are 
in communication upstream (70,64,72) of the fuel discharge 

orifices. The first air and fuel discharge orifices have 
a relationship to establish a pneumatic pressure at the 

first fuel discharge orifice and the second air and fuel 
discharge orifices have a relationship to establish a 

different pneumatic pressure at the second fuel 
discharge orifice such that, in the event the supply of 

fuel to the first and second fuel discharge orifices is 
interrupted, the fuel residing in the fuel passages 

between the first and second fuel discharge orifices is 
subjected to a pressure differential effective to purge 

the resident fuel into the combustor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel injector for a
combustor of a gas turbine engine comprising
an injector body means having first and second air
discharge orifices for discharging air to the combustor
andfirst and second fuel passage means having respective
first and second fuel discharge orifices for discharging
fuel to the combustor.A fuel injector with these characteristics is e.g. described in
FR-A-2 269 646. In this prior art document, the temperature of
the fuel is used for cooling purposes.Efforts to reduce emissions and improve combustor performance
in gas turbine engines have brought about the use of staged
fuel systems wherein one or more fuel injectors are used for
low speed (low power) engine operation and one or more other
fuel injectors are used for higher speed (higher power) engine
operation. The fuel injectors used for low speed engine
operation are commonly referred to as pilot or primary fuel
injectors for providing a continuous flow to the engine
combustor for all regimes of engine operation from idle to high
speed operation. The fuel injectors used for higher speed
engine operation are referred to as secondary or main injectors
for providing supplemental fuel flow to the engine combustor in
an on-demand manner when higher engine speed (power) is
required. The secondary fuel injectors thus are rendered non-operative
during idle operation of the engine when the 
supplemental fuel flow is not needed and are rendered operative
during higher speed (power) engine operation when supplemental
fuel flow is required.Airblast fuel injectors have been used in non-staged gas
turbine engine fuel systems and are described in U.S. Patent
3,864,186 issued August 16, 1972 and U.S. Patent 3,980,233
issued Sept. 14, 1976. Airblast fuel injectors are designed to
achieve atomization of a film of liquid fuel formed on a fuel
discharge orifice surface or lip by directing high velocity
airflow supplied to the injector from the engine compressor at
the fuel film as it leaves the orifice surface.Airblast fuel injectors have been proposed for use in a staged
gas turbine engine fuel system. However, use of airblast fuel
injectors in a staged fuel system may present a so-called
coking problem when the airblast fuel injectors comprise the
secondary (or main) injectors of the system that are rendered
non-operative during some engine operational regimes (e.g., low
power regime such as low speed idle operation) and operative
during other engine operational regimes (e.g., high speed
operation). In particular,
