<ABSTRACT>
A bed includes a bed body (10), ascending and descending means 
(17,18), 

and an auxiliary leg member (20). The bed body (10) has a floor frame 
(12), and a main leg member (16) fixed to the floor frame (12). The 

ascending 
and descending means (17,18) has an ascending and descending link 

(19), and 
an extensible and retractable actuator for operating the 

ascending and descending link (19). The ascending and descending 
link (19) holds the bed body (10) with one of the opposite ends, and it 

holds the auxiliary leg member (20) with the other one of the 
opposite ends. For instance, the ascending and descending link (19) 

constitutes a parallel link, the floor frame (12) constitutes one of 
the parallel elements of the parallel link (19), and the auxiliary 

leg member (20) constitutes the other one of the parallel elements 
of the parallel link, thereby enabling the whole bed body (10) 

including a mattress to ascend and descend.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bed according to claim 1.Bed-making required for service beds in sleeping
accommodations, such as hotels and the like, is usually carried
out by pushing a sheet under the rim of a mattress which is
placed on a bed. However, since it is necessary for a bed-making
personnel to complete a large number of beds in a
limited period of time, it is an extremely demanding job. In
particular, since the bed-making personnels must bend the body
forward in order to carry out the bed-making, many of them
suffer from backache. Accordingly, there arises a problem
about which the accommodation industry is concerned.In order to solve the aforementioned problem, it is
possible to think of converting a continuously variable type
ascending and descending mechanism for a medical bed (as set
forth in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 57-139,319) 
into the service beds. However, the ascending and
descending mechanism is designed to adjust the bed height
variable continuously, it takes a long time to move the bed
from descended positions to ascended positions or vice versa.
Accordingly, there still remains a drawback which inhibits the
ascending and descending mechanism from being practically
applied to the service beds, because it is necessary to
complete the bed-making of the service beds in a short period
of time.Hence, the assignee of the present invention applied a
Japanese Patent for a newly invented bed in Japanese Patent
Application No. 3-347,028. The bed comprises a bed body
provided with an extensible and retractable actuator which is
capable of extending and retracting quickly by the action of a
gas spring or the like. With the extensible and retractable
actuator, an ascending and descending link comprising a
parallel link or the like is operated so as to ascend an
ascending and descending base, which is fixed to the ascending
and descending link, from a descended position (i.e., an
ordinary service position) to an ascended position and to hold
the base there where a bed-making personnel can carry out the
bed-making with ease.The bed according to the prior Japanese Patent
Application, however, has the following drawback. Namely, the 
bed is designed to ascend and descend the ascending and
descending base which is disposed on the top side of the bed
body. Accordingly, when ascending the ascending and descending
base, the bed body and the mattress are separated from each
other so that a bed-making personnel scarcely appreciates the
displacements of the mattress. As a

<CLAIMS>
A bed comprising

a bed body (10) including a floor frame (12) and a main leg
member (16) fixed to the floor frame (12), and
an ascending and descending means (17, 18, 22, 23A, 23B)
including an ascending and descending link (22, 23A, 23B) and

an extensible and retractable actuator (17, 18) for operating
the ascending and descending link (22, 23A, 23B); wherein
the ascending and descending link (22, 23A, 23B) has
opposite ends, with one of the opposite ends holding the bed

body (10)
characterised in that

the other one of the opposite ends holds an
auxiliary leg member (20) and in that casters (32; 39)

are provided such that the casters are lifted depending on the
descending operation of the bed body and that the casters

contact the ground depending on the ascending operation of the
bed body.
The bed according to claim 1,

wherein said ascending and descending link (22, 23A, 23B)
