<ABSTRACT>
An interlocking joint (1) for linking sheets (3) attached 
to or incorporating the joint (1) together in a sealed manner 

to form a screen, the joint (1) comprising a hook portion (6) 
extending substantially along the length of a free edge (4) of 

the joint (1), a rib portion (8) extending substantially along the 
length of the joint (1) adjacent the hooked portion (6) and a hook 

receiving portion, the hooked portion (6) and the ribbed 
portion (8) defining a first space (11) therebetween and the hook 

receiving portion and the rib portion (8) defining a second 
space (12) therebetween, wherein the shape of the first space (11) 

substantially corresponds to the shape of the ribbed 
portion (8) and the shape of the second space (12) substantially 

corresponds to the shape of the hooked portion (6) such that 
the interlocking joint (1) can slidably receive a substantially 

identical interlocking joint (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interlocking 
sealing joint and more particularly to an interlocking 
joint for joining sheets together to form a screen for use 
in sealing an area of underground soil from ground water or 
contaminated soil and/or water. European Patent document EP-A-0 129 275 discloses 
a series of thin walled sheets which are joined together by 
locks which are formed with thick walls along the vertical 
free edges of the sheets. Each lock consists of a male end 
adapted to be fixed to a sheet and a female end adapted to 
be fixed to an adjacent sheet. The male and female ends 
interlock the sheets to create a watertight screen. The 
female end is provided with a longitudinally extending slot 
which extends along the length of its thick wall. Free 
edges of the slot are turned in toward one another such 
that the slot can receive a head portion of the male end of 
the lock. The head portion is retained in the slot by the 
free edges of the slot. Accordingly, when connecting two adjacent sheets 
together it is necessary to provide a first sheet with a 
male locking portion and a second sheet with a female 
locking portion to enable the respective lock components to 
interlock. Thus, the sheets provided with the lock 
components must be oriented in the correct direction to 
ensure that male and female lock components are adjacent 
one another to enable the lock components to interlock to 
form the screen. Additionally, the production of a lock 
having a male and a female portion requires the use of two 
moulds to produce matched pairs of lock components. 
Further, when a supplier provides an end user with the  
 
matched pairs of lock components, equal quantities of both 
male and female lock components must be supplied. 
Consequently, two extruders are required to operate 
simultaneously if the producer wishes to avoid downtime 
caused by changing moulds on a single extruder. An expansion seal is located in the slot of the 
female end to improve the sealing quality of the lock 
thereby providing a watertight joint. Usually, upon 
contact with moisture, an expansion seal will swell to a 
larger size to seal small gaps. However, it is normal 
practice for the expansion seal to be manually inserted 
into the slot on site. The situation may arise where a 
construction worker either neglects or purposely omits 
inserting the seal thereby reducing the integrity of the 
watertight seal between the locks. Moreover, a broken seal 
or two seals can sometimes be inserted in the slot such 
that

An interlocking joint for linking sheets (3) 
attached to or incorporating the joint (1) together in a 

sealed manner to form a screen, the joint (1) comprising a 
hook portion (6) extending substantially along the length 

of a free edge (7) of the joint (1), a rib portion (8) 
extending substantially along the length of the joint (1) 

adjacent the hook portion (6) and a hook receiving portion 
(12) defined by a kinked portion (5) of the joint (1) and 

the rib portion (8), the hook portion (6) and the rib 
portion (8) defining a first space (11) therebetween and 

the hook receiving portion and the rib portion (8) defining 
a second space (12) therebetween, wherein the shape of the 

first space (11) substantially corresponds to the shape of 
the rib portion (8) and the shape of the second space (12) 

substantially corresponds to the shape of the hook portion 
(6) such that the interlocking joint (1) can slidably 

receive another interlocking joint (1), characterised in 
that the first space (11) between the hook portion (6) and 

the rib portion (8) is provided with means (14,15) for 
retaining an expansion seal (16). 
An interlocking joint according to Claim 1, wherein 
the means (14,15) for retaining the expansion seal 

comprises a neck portion (14,15) formed in the rib-portion 
(8) which is dimensioned to retain an expansion seal (16) 

when the expansion seal (16) is in an unexpanded state. 
An interlocking joint according to Claim 2, wherein 
the expansion seal (16), in an expanded state, contacts the 

rib portion (8) of a second interlocking joint (1) slidably 
received within the interlocking joint (1) thereby further 

sealing the interlocking joint (1).  
 
An interlocking joint according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the interlocking joint (1) is formed by an 

extrusion process. 
An interlocking joint according to Claim 4, wherein 
an expansion seal (16) is co-extruded with the interlocking 

joint (1) to produce an interlocking joint (1) formed with 
an expansion seal (16). 
An interlocking joint according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 4, wherein an expansion seal (16) is positioned 

in the first space (11) after the interlocking joint (1) 
has been formed. 
An interlocking joint according to any preceding 
claim, in which the joint (1) is attached by an attachment 

means provided on the joint (1) to a sheet (3) or screen, 
which sheet (3) or screen is for use in providing a barrier 

for preventing soil or fluid from passing through the sheet 
(3) or joint (1). 
An interlocking joint according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the joint (1) is interlockable with a 

substantially identical joint (1). 
An interlocking joint according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the seal (16) includes a hydrophilling 

agent. 
An interlocking joint according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the seal (16) is made from a polymer. 
An interlocking joint according to Claim 11, 
wherein a hydrophilling agent is trapped in the polymer.  

 
A seal comprising two interlocking joints (1) 
according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the 

two interlocking joints (1) are slidably received by one 
another.
