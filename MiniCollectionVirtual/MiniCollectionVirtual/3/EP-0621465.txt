<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flow transducer muff (2) for positioning 
an essentially square-angled parallelepiped-shaped 

flow transducer (24) in an expiration channel of a ventilator. 
The flow transducer muff (2) comprises a first muff half (4) 

and a second muff half (6), devised for connection to both 
sides of the flow transducer (24), and a connecting link (8), 

attached to the muff halves (4, 6), so they can be bent around 
the connecting link (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flow transducer muff for positioning 
an essentially square-angled parallelepiped-shaped 
flow transducer in an expiration channel of a ventilator, 
comprising a first muff half and a second muff half, devised 
for connection on both sides of the flow transducer. Expired gas flow is measured in a flow transducer on the expiration 
side of a ventilator. The flow transducer is retained 
in position in the expiration channel with a flow transducer 
muff which forms a gas-tight connection to the flow transducer. 
The Operating Manual of the Servo Ventilator 900C, AG 
0888 12, August 1988, Siemens-Elema AB, page 10: 2-3, describes 
one such flow transducer muff. In principle, the known 
flow transducer muff consists of two halves which are connected 
on both sides of the flow transducer. The two muff halves are identical in shape, so there is a risk 
of the flow transducer being reinstalled in a reversed position 
in the ventilator after cleaning. One object of the invention is to achieve a flow transducer 
muff which assures that the flow transducer is correctly 
positioned when installed in the expiration channel. Another object of the invention is to achieve a flow transducer 
muff which is simple to manufacture, provides a secure, 
gas-tight connection to the flow transducer, while simultaneously 
facilitating connection of the flow transducer, and 
reduces the number of components in the expiration channel. One such flow transducer muff is achieved in accordance with 
the invention by a connecting link, attached to the first muff  
 
half and to the second muff half so the muff halves can be 
bent around the connecting link. With the connecting link, the flow transducer muff consists of 
a single integrated unit. The connecting link also provides an 
orientation for the flow transducer, ensuring that it is positioned 
in the right direction. Since the connecting link is 
elastically devised, the two muff halves can be readily bent 
around it when the flow transducer is to be connected to the 
flow transducer muff or disassembled. In conjunction herewith, it is advantageous if the connecting 
link comprises a thin, elastic disc whose width is largely 
identical to the diameter of the muff halves. The flow transducer muffs becomes more stable because the connecting 
link has a width which is generally the same as the 
diameter of the muff halves. In order to ensure that the flow transducer really is positioned 
in the correct direction in the flow transducer muff, 
it is

A flow transducer muff for positioning an essentially 
square-angled parallelepiped-shaped flow transducer (24) in an 

expiration channel of a ventilator, comprising a first muff 
half (4) and a second muff half (6), devised for connection to 

both sides of the flow transducer (24), characterized by an 
elastic connecting link (8) attached to the first muff half 

(4) and to the second muff half (6) so the muff halves (4, 6) 
can be bent around the connecting link (8). 
A flow transducer muff according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the connecting link (8) comprises a thin, elastic disc 

(16) whose width is largely identical to the diameter of the 
muff halves. 
A flow transducer muff according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the muff halves (4, 6) are devised with at 

least one support boss (18, 20) against which at least one of 
the flow transducer's (24) end surfaces presses when the flow 

transducer is attached. 
A flow transducer muff according to any of the above 
claims, characterized in that the muff halves are asymmetrically 

devised so the flow transducer can only be 
connected to the expiration channel in one way. 
A flow transducer muff according to any of the above 
claims, characterized in that the muff halves (4, 6) and the 

connecting link (8) are made in a single piece, preferably by 
die-casting.
