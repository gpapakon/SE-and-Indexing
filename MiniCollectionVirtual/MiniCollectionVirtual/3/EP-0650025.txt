<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat exchanger of the type which is 
constructed from a number of heat exchanger elements (1) consisting of a 

tubular jacket (2) with thermal transfer tubes (3) lying within the jacket. The 
heat exchanger elements (1) are joined together to form a heat exchanger, in 

that each end of a heat exchanger element is provided with a modular unit 
(4) which constitutes the frame of the heat exchanger. A jacket connection 

(5) is connected to each two modular units (4) and constitutes an extension 
of the tubular jacket (2). The jacket connection (5) is designed as an H pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat exchanger according to
the preamble of claim 1.Heat exchangers, of which there are numerous types, are
employed to heat or cool a liquid product. Using, for example,
steam or water at different temperatures, it is possible to
heat or cool a product, which is preferably liquiform, to the
desired level. Heat exchangers are put into use within various
process industries and are also common occurrences within food
industries such as, for example, dairies.
One well-known type of heat exchanger is the so-called tube
heat exchanger which consists of one or more heat exchanger
elements which are interconnected into a flow system. The heat
exchanger elements include one or more thermal transfer
tubes surrounded by an outer tubular jacket. The thermal
transfer tubes are interconnected to form a product flow
insert which, in turn, is interconnected by means of product
elbow pipes so as to circulate the product which is to be
heated or cooled depending upon the process for which the heat 
exchanger is employed. The thermal transfer tubes lie enclosed
in a tubular jacket that surrounds the thermal transfer medium
which may consist of water at different temperatures, steam or
other types of liquids or gases.A heat exchanger of the kind indicated in the preamble of
claim 1 is known from US-A-710 810 or US-A-1 037 798 where the
tubular jackets are connected with each other by coupling
pieces which support the tubular jackets as well as the
transfer tubes. The elbow pipe, which is attached to the
coupling piece, as well as the coupling pieces are secured to
each other by bolts and flanges. US-A-710 810 shows an
assembly where the coupling pieces of pairs of tubular jackets
can be bolted to each other linearly in order to be able to
assemble heat exchangers of different sizes.
These types of heat exchanger are, however, complex and
expensive to produce. It requires exact fit of connections, at
the same time as demanding a certain degree of play on being
mounted in a frame, since the tubes in the heat exchangers are
subjected to thermal expansion which may give rise to extreme
inner stresses in both tubes and frame. Therefore, a stiff and
supporting frame is necessary in order to assemble large heat
exchangers.Moreover, the replacement of gaskets and other spare parts is
difficult and requires lots of time to remove bolts, flanges
and other connecting parts. Additionally, there is no
possibility to connect heat exchanger elements in other
directions than linearly next to each other
