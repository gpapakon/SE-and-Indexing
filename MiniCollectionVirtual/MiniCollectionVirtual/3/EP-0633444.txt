<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger consists of a plurality of exchange tubes (1) arranged parallel to one another. For the passage of one of the media participating in the heat exchange, the cross-section of the exchange tubes has a width which is large in relation to the height. Fastened to each of the two flat sides (2) of the exchange tubes (1) are ribs (3) which are formed from a ribbed band (strip) (4) which is multiply deflected in a meandering fashion. In order to reduce the influence of any possible pollutants (pollution) on the heat transfer performance of the heat exchanger, the ribs (3) are provided with a plurality of openings (9). The cross-sections of these openings are respectively at least as large as the cross-section (Q), through which flow occurs, between two adjacent ribs (3). The ribs (3) are preferably fastened to the flat sides (2) of the exchange tubes (1) by means of a capacitor discharge welding process.

<CLAIMS>
Heat exchanger composed of a plurality of
exchanger tubes (1) arranged parallel to one another, of

which the cross-section for the passage of one of the
media involved in the heat exchange has a width (B) which

is large in relation to the height (H) and which, to form
a multiplicity of flow ducts for the other medium

involved in the heat exchange, the said flow ducts
running at right angles to the longitudinal direction of

the exchanger tube (1), are provided on the two flat
sides (2) with ribs (3) composed of a multiply deflected

rib strip (4) having orifices and fastened to the

exchanger tube (1), characterized in that the orifices
(9) in the region of those deflections (5) of the ribs

(3) which are parallel to the flat side (2) of the
exchanger tubes (1) are designed in each case with at

least the size of the flow cross-section of the flow duct
formed by two adja-cent ribs (3) of the same exchanger

tube (1).
Heat exchanger according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the orifices (9) of the ribs (3) of adja-cent

exchanger tubes (1) overlap one another.
Heat exchanger according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the side faces of the ribs (3) are

provided in the region of the rib foot with additional
orifices (11), of which the orifice cross-sections are in

each case smaller than the cross-section of the flow
ducts formed by two adjacent ribs (3).
Heat exchanger according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the additional orifices (11) are in each 

case located half-away along the length between two
successive orifices (9).
Heat exchanger according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the rib strip (4) is

folded approximately rectangularly, so that the deflections
(5) form plane faces (6) for bearing on the flat

sides (2) of the exchanger tube (1) or on correspondingly
shaped faces of the rib strip (4) of the adjacent

exchanger tube (1).
Heat exchanger according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized by pressed portions (10) of

partly recessed and partly raised shape in the side faces
of the ribs (3).
Heat exchanger according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the rib strip (4) is

fastened to the flat sides (2) of the exchanger tube (1)
by means of a continuous linear weld.
Heat exchanger according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the rib strip (4) is welded to the respective

flat side (2) by means of a capacitor-discharge
welding method.
