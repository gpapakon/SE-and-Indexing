<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR PEROXIDE BLEACHING OF MECHANICAL PULPThis invention is a process for bleaching hard¬ wood pulp with a peroxygen-soda ash solution in the absence of silicates. Bleaching mechanical and high yield-pulps with hydrogen peroxide is well known technology, having been practiced industrially for many years.Hydrogen peroxide is susceptible to catalytic decomposition by heavy metallic ions and enzymes: its stability tends to decrease with increasing alka¬ linity. It is necessary to adjust and maintain pH at a level which permits effective bleaching and at the same time minimizes decomposition. Thus, peroxide solutions must be buffered and stabilized. The most common buffer is sodium silicate, which is also capable of acting as a stabilizer. Usually a small amount of magnesium ion is added to form a colloidal suspension of magnesium silicate, which is believed to inactivate the metallic catalysts by adsorption. The present trend is toward high-yield pulps with a higher increase of brightness (20 to 25 points) and toward minimizing the environmental impact of pulp mills by total recycle of process water (zero liquid effluent) . However, it has been found that recycle of process water containing sodium silicate can re¬ sult in an intolerable buildup of silica scale. Consequently, attempts have been made to avoid adding sodium silicate to the process bleach liquor.Chelating agents have long been recognized to be useful for stabilizing solutions containing hydrogen peroxide. For example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,860,391 the bleaching of cellulose textile fibers and mix¬ tures with synthetic fibers is accomplished by employing peroxide in a silicate-free system in the presence of an aliphatic hydroxy compound, an amino alkylenephosphonic acid compound and, alternatively. 

with the addition of a pol,yaminocarboxylic acid erythritol.Other more recent U.S. patents employ such phos- phonates as indicated above, but in a peroxide bleaching system, include U.S. Patent No. 4,239,643 and its divisional U.S. Patent No. 4,294,575.While combinations of chelating agents are useful in-stabilizing peroxide bleaching systems, iron, manganese and copper are catalysts for the decomposi- tion of the peroxide and their presence also reduces the brightness of finished mechanical pulps according to U.S. Patent No. 4,732,650. While the chelants might be expected to tie up minor amounts of the metal ions, the presence of significant amounts of magnesium and/or calcium ions tends to overwhelm the ability of the chelants to complex
