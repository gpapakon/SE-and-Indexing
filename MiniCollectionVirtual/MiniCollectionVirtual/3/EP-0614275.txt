<ABSTRACT>
A bias voltage (26) for a VCO (20) is generated by monitoring 
UP and DOWN control signals to a charge pump (14) and generating 

first and second output signals upon detecting a predetermined 
number of consecutive UP pulses or DOWN pulses. The first output 

signal causes a shift register (64) pre-loaded with a data pattern 
having one odd logic state to shift one bit location to left, while 

the second output signal moves the odd logic state one bit location 
to the right. The bias voltage to the VCO is selected based on the 

odd logic state bit location. Any variation in VCO output frequency 
due to intermittent ground bounce is eliminated by requiring a 

consecutive number of UP pulses or DOWN pulses before moving the 
VCO bias point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to phase lock loops
and, more particularly, to a bias voltage generator for a voltage controlled
oscillator in a phase lock loop. It also relates to a bias voltage generating method.A conventional phase lock loop (PLL) generally includes a
phase detector for monitoring a phase difference between an input
signal and an output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).
The phase detector generates an UP control signal and a DOWN
control signal for a charge pump to charge and discharge a loop
filter at a loop node at the input of the VCO. The loop voltage
developed across the loop filter determines the output frequency of
the VCO. The UP and DOWN control signals driving the charge pump
set the proper loop filter voltage at the input of the VCO to
maintain a predetermined phase relationship between the signals
applied to the phase detector.PLLs are widely used in data communications, local area
networks in computer applications, microprocessors and data
storage applications to control data transfers. PLLs are often
implemented with Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
(CMOS) technology to provide low cost and low power operation
allowing a system designer to extend the tracking range and
frequency-aided acquisition.A common problem related to VCO operation is ground bounce
which causes undesirable UP and DOWN pulses from the phase
detector and results in voltage fluctuations at the loop node.
Ground bounce is typically caused by other activity on the
integrated circuit such as digital bus switching. The ground bounce
can induce a short duration swing, say 5 ns, in the power supply
potential to the phase detector, charge pump and loop filter
capacitor, which generates UP and DOWN pulses unrelated to the
phase error between the input signals to the phase detector. The
UP and DOWN pulses related to ground bounce cause movement in
the loop node and undesired changes in VCO output frequency. The 
PLL must wait for the phase detector to correct for the improper
VCO output frequency in its normal fashion. Unfortunately, ground
bounce often results in erroneous VCO operation.Hence, a need exists to maintain the VCO output at a
frequency determined solely by the phase error to the phase
detector independent of external influences like ground bounce.US 5075 640 discloses a bias voltage generating circuit for a
phase lock loop.In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is
provided a circuit for generating a bias voltage for a phase lock
loop as set forth
