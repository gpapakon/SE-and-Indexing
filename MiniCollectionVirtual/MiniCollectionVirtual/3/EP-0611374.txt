<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 17β-substituted 
4-aza-5α-androstan-3-one derivatives, to a 
process for their preparation, and to pharmaceutical 
compositions containing them. These compounds are 
inhibitors of androgen action, by means of testosterone 5α-reductase 
inhibition. In certain androgen responsive tissues the action of 
testosterone is mediated primarily through its 5α-reduced 
metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Bruchowsky N., 
Wilson J.D.; J. Biol. Chem. 243, 5953, 1968). The 
conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone is 
catalysed by the enzyme 5α-reductase and if 5α-reductase is 
inhibited, the formation of dihydrotestosterone is reduced 
and its specific androgenic effect is attenuated or 
prevented. The 5α-reductase inhibitors may find medical 
application for the treatment of hyperandrogenic 
conditions, e.g. certain prostatic diseases, such as benign 
prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer, and certain 
skin-hair conditions, such as acne, seborrhoea, female 
hirsutism and male pattern baldness (Siiteri P.K., Wilson 
J.D., J. Clin. Invest. 49, 1737, 1970; Price V.H., Arch. 
Dermatol. III, 1496, 1975; Sandberg A.A., Urology 17, 34, 
1981). Also breast cancer treatment can take advantage 
from use of 5α-reductase inhibitors as the said tumour is 
known to be aggravated by presence of androgens. Androst4-en-3-one-17β-carboxylic  
 
acid and its methyl ester (Voigt 
and Hsia, Endocrinology, 92, 1216 (1973); Canadian Patent 
No. 970,692) are among the first steroidic compounds 
described as 5a-reductase inhibitors. Two 5,10-secosteroids having a 3-keto-4,5-diene 
system in the expanded ring have been found to be selective 
inhibitors of rat epididymal 5α-reductase (Robaire et al., 
J. Steroid Biochem. 8, 307-310 (1977)). The (2OR)-4-diazo-21-hydroxy-20-methyl-5α-pregnan-3-one 
and its analogs are reported to be enzyme activated 
inhibitors of testosterone 5α-reductase (Blohm et al., 
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 95, 273-80 (1980); United 
States Patent 4,317,817). Another series of enzyme-directed irreversible 
inhibitors of 5α-reductase have been prepared by 
introducing a 6-methylene moiety into substrates type 3-keto-Δ4-progestins 
and androgens (Petrow et al., Steroids 
38, 352-53 (1981); United States Patent 4,396,615)). More recently unsaturated derivatives of 3-carboxy 
steroids have been reported as uncompetitive 5α-reductase 
inhibitors versus testosterone (Biorg. Chem. 17, 372-376 
(1989); Eur. Pat. Appln. no. 0289327). 4-Aza steroids are by far the most
