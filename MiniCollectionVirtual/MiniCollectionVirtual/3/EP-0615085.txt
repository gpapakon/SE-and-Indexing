<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a seal (2) for the end of a shaft (7) extending out of the end wall (62) of a housing (6) and for the end wall (62) itself is distinguished in that a seal holder (20) is produced as a light metal diecasting, that a sealing element (10) of polytetrafluoroethylene is pressed in from a side of the seal holder (20) towards which a clearance (201) in the diecasting (20) is facing, and the radially outer section (12) of the shaft sealing ring (10) is encapsulated on both sides in an elastomer material via a connecting channel (23) of the diecasting (20) to form an end-wall groove (21) for receiving a static seal (3) during the moulding of the latter onto the seal holder. In a final operation, the sealing lip (11) of the sealing element (10) cut off from a tube is bent around by drawing onto a sleeve in the axial direction.

Method for the manufacture of a seal (2) for the end of a shaft
(7) passing out of the end wall (62) of a casing (6), as well

as for the end wall (62), with a gasket receptacle (20) in
the form of a casting and having a casing side (26), a passage

opening (21) for the shaft (7), a sealing element (10) located
in the passage opening and a static gasket (3) made from an

elastomer material located on the casing side (26) for providing
a sealing action with respect to the end wall (62) of the casing

(6), an outer portion (12) of the shaft seal ring engaging
on a collar (28) delimiting a recess (201) of the gasket receptacle

(20) and being fastened on both sides to the gasket receptacle
by elastomer material, which is linked with the static gasket

(3), characterized in that the gasket receptacle (20) is manufactured
as a light metal pressure die casting, that the dynamic

sealing element (10) is made from a plastic having good compatibility
with the medium to be sealed, e.g. oil,and is pressed under

radial and axial pressing into the recess (201) of the
gasket receptacle (20) from the casing side (26)

towards which the recess (201) is open, that
the radially directed, outer portion (12) of the shaft seal

ring (10) is injected round on both sides with the elastomer
material via a connecting channel (23) in the gasket receptacle

(20) to an end wall-side reception groove (21) for the static
gasket (3) during the moulding thereof to the gasket receptacle.
Seal for the end of a shaft (7) passing out of the end wall
(62) of a casing (6), as well as for the end wall (62), with

a gasket receptacle (20) in the form of a casting and having
a casing side (26), a passage opening (21) for the shaft (7),

a sealing element (10) located in the passage opening and a
static gasket (3) made from an elastomer material located on

the casing side (26) for providing a sealing action with respect
to the end wall (62) of the casing (6), an outer portion (12)

of the shaft seal ring engaging on a collar (28) which delimits a 
recess (201) of the gasket receptacle (20) and being fastened

on both sides to the gasket receptacle by elastomer material,
which is linked with the static gasket (3), characterized in

that the gasket receptacle is constructed as a light metal
pressure die casting (20), that the recess (201) is open to

the casing side (26) of the gasket receptacle and the sealing
member (10) made from a plastic with a good compatibility with

respect to the medium to be sealed, e.g. oil is pressed from the
casing side (26) against the collar (28) under radial and axial

pressure in the recess (201) and that the radially directed
outer portion (12) of the sealing member (10) is bordered on

both sides by rings (30,31,32) having the same external diameter
and made from elastomer material, which are connected by means

of at least one common connecting channel (23) to a groove
(21) on the casing side (26) for receiving the static gasket

(3).
Seal according to claim 2, characterized in that the elastomer
material ring (31) is received on the side of the sealing member

(10) remote from the casing (6) in a circular groove (29) undercutting
the collar (28).
Seal according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the sealing
member (10) is made from polytetrafluoroethylene and engages

on the shaft (7) by means of a sealing lip (11) bent in the
axial direction.
Seal according to claim 4, characterized in that the sealing
lip (11) is provided with slots (110) in the form of a multi-start

thread for forming a return feed action for the medium
to be sealed.
Seal according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the shaft
seal ring is radially split for forming a protective lip (16). 
Seal according to claim 6, characterized in that the protective
lip (16) is bent away from the sealing lip (11).
Seal according to claim 6, characterized in that the protective
lip (16) is bent towards the sealing lip (11).
Seal according to one of the claims 2 to 8, characterized in
that the recess (201) is constructed as an eccentric bore.
Seal according to one of the claims 2 to 9, characterized in
that the seal has an integrated antirotation face (72) for

rotating with the shaft (7).
