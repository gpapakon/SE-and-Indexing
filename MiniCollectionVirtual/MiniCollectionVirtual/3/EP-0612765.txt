<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chlorination or chlorosulfonation of olefin 
polymers. In particular, this invention relates to a process for preparation of 
chlorinated or chlorosulfonated olefin polymers in suspension in 
perfluorinated alkane, perfluorinated ether, or perfluorinated trialkyl 
amine media in the presence of fluorinated surfactants. Chlorinated and chlorosulfonated olefin homopolymers and 
copolymers are well-known compositions useful as elastomers, coatings, 
adhesives, and inks. The chlorinated polymers are prepared on a 
commercial scale by reaction of chlorine with olefin polymers in either 
solution or aqueous suspension, while the chlorosulfonated analogues are 
prepared by reaction of olefin polymers with chlorine and sulfuryl chloride 
or sulfur dioxide in solution. Reactive extrusion and solventless processes 
have also been disclosed, for example in U.S.-A-3,347,835 and in U.S.-A-4,554,326. 
In addition, chlorination and chlorosulfonation of 
solvent-swollen ethylene polymers in fluids consisting of fluorocarbons 
having 14 carbon atoms has been disclosed in British Patent GB-A-1,325,579. Each of these prior art processes has disadvantages. Specifically, 
solution processes require large volumes of organic solvents, generally 
chlorinated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, which must be recovered 
and recycled. In addition, many chlorinated solvents are not inert to further 
chlorination. This leads to production of unwanted byproducts which must 
be removed. For example, hydrofluorocarbon solvents undergo 
appreciable chlorination resulting in the production of undesirable 
chlorofluorocarbons. In addition, due to the environmental hazards 
associated with these halogenated materials, stringent control of emissions 
and investments in pollution control equipment are necessary. 
Aqueous suspension processes, on the other hand, cannot be used for 
preparation of chlorosulfonated olefin polymers. Further, chlorinations in  
 
aqueous suspension produce non-homogeneously chlorinated products. 
Reactive extrusion processes are not attractive because they are either 
limited to production of compositions containing low levels of chlorine, e.g. 
as disclosed in U.S.-A-4,554,326, or they are not adaptable for use on a 
commercial scale without major modification, see for example U.S.-A-3,347,835. 
Solventless processes are also not adapted to commercial scale 
exploitation. Finally, the process disclosed in British Patent GB-A-1,325,579, 
wherein fluorocarbon-swollen ethylene polymers
