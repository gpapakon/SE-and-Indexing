<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ferritic alloy
steels used for making pipe molds. More particularly, the
present invention relates to ferritic alloy steels for
making very large pipe molds which may be used for
centrifugally casting pipe with an inside diameter greater
than 40 inches.Pipe molds that are used for centrifugally casting
pipe normally have an elongated cylindrical section with a
"Bell" and a "Spigot" end. These ends are separated by a
"Barrel" section. One of the most commonly used steels for
making pipe molds for centrifugally casting pipe is the AISI
4130 grade. This steel grade according to the "AISI 4130,"

The AISI 4130 grade steel does not contain vanadium, does
not have high levels of manganese, at best has low levels of
nickel, has only moderate levels of chromium, and has low
levels of molybdenum.Conventional thinking has been that pipe mold
service life is primarily dependent on the properties of
hardness and strength of the as-heat treated pipe mold.
Because of this, the only properties considered were these
in attempting to make pipe molds with long service lives.The main element that imparts hardness and
strength to pipe mold steels is carbon. Therefore, it has
been thought that to create pipe molds with long service
lives there had to be high levels of carbon in the steel.
Consistent with this thinking, the AISI 4130 grade had high
carbon in the range of 0.28-0.33%.A departure from this thinking was to make the
carbon level directly related to the pipe mold size. Table
II is an example of this:

the pipe mold size. Since small size pipe molds with high
carbon had a greater likelihood of quench cracking during
heat treatment or premature failure during service, the
carbon was
