<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to compositions of 
and methods for obtaining somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). 
The invention relates as well to the DNA sequences 
encoding somatostatin receptors, the recombinant vectors 
carrying those sequences, the recombinant host cells 
including either the sequences or vectors, and 
recombinant somatostatin receptor polypeptides. In 
particular embodiments, the invention relates to the 
cloning and functional expression of at least three 
different somatostatin receptors, SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3 
from a variety of sources including human DNA. The 
invention includes as well, methods for using the 
isolated, recombinant receptor polypeptides in assays 
designed to select and improve among candidate substances 
such as agonists and antagonists of somatostatin receptor 
polypeptides for use in diagnostic, drug design and 
therapeutic applications. Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide that was first 
isolated from hypothalamic extracts and shown to be a 
potent inhibitor of growth hormone secretion from the 
anterior pituitary (Brazeau et al. 1973). Subsequent 
studies have shown that this hormone is widely 
distributed, occurring in the central nervous system and 
peripheral tissues of the body such as the stomach, the  
 
intestines, and pancreas (Reichlin 1983). It is known 
that somatostatin has diverse physiological effects that 
are tissue specific (Reichlin 1983). It can, for 
instance, function as a neurotransmitter as well as a 
hormone. Its hormonal effects include suppression of the 
release of many pituitary, pancreatic and 
gastrointestinal hormones and other secretory proteins. 
For these reasons, treatment of patients with native 
somatostatin may have numerous, and undesirable effects. 
A much preferred mode of treatment would allow 
segregating the desired therapeutic effect form 
undesirable physiological effects. At present, the only 
way to perfect such drugs is through the use of whole 
animal studies or by using crude isolations of these 
receptors. Somatostatin is a member of a family of 
somatostatin-like peptides (Pradayrol et al. 1980; Esch 
et al. 1980). The two principle bioactive forms of 
somatostatin, somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28, are 
derived via a tissue-specific proteolytic processing of 
prosomatostatin, a 92 amino acid precursor (Shen et al. 
1982). It is known, as well, that somatostatin-14 and 
somatostatin-28 may be found in varying concentrations in 
different tissues. Although somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 may 
have
