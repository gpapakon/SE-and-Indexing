<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a see-through
concrete form through which the state of concrete packed
in the concrete form can be inspected at the time of
concrete placing.As concrete form, forms made of woody
materials such as southern sea's timber and the like
have so far been used. When concrete is placed in those
concrete forms having no see-through property, however,
the state of concrete packed in the form cannot be
inspected visually. Thus, when the concrete packed in a
form is in a defective state such as having a gap
between form and concrete, it has been sometimes
necessary to destroy the once produced construction
after the concrete-placing and to place concrete again.For such a reason, the use of a transparent
synthetic resin board as a concrete form has been
proposed (Japanese Patent Application KOKAI No. 64-80665,
No. 1-94159, etc.). However, this transparent
synthetic resin board is inferior in stiffness and
impact strength, and can exhibit a sufficient strength
as a concrete form only when an additional measure such 
as increasing the thickness of the top, bonding a
crosspiece, etc. is taken.In view of above, the present inventors
conducted studies with the aim of developing a concrete
form having a sufficient strength as a concrete form and
a transparency enough to enable a visual inspection of
the state of concrete packed in the form. Based on the
studies, the present invention was accomplished.Thus, the present invention provides a
concrete form a part of which is made of a fiber-reinforced
thermoplastic resin, said fiber-reinforced
thermoplastic resin satisfying the following conditions:
Tt(C) ≧ Tt(M) - 1.5α15 ≦ Tt(C)
wherein Tt(C) (%) is total transmittance of the fiber-reinforced
thermoplastic resin measured at the thickness
of top board, α (% by weight) is fiber weight fraction
in the fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin, and Tt(M)
(%) is total transmittance of the matrix resin measured
at the same thickness as above.
The invention will be described in detail in connection with
the drawings in which:
Fig. 1 illustrates one embodiment of the
present concrete form having a number of ribs on its 
backside as viewed from the rib side;Fig. 2 illustrates a sectional view of the
concrete form at A-A' in Fig. 1, wherein:
6:top board, and7:ribs; andFig. 3 illustrates the apparatus used for
impact test of the concrete form according to one
embodiment of the invention, wherein:
1:load,2:point of impact,3:test piece (top board),4:bearer for test piece, and5:tip of the point of impact.A
