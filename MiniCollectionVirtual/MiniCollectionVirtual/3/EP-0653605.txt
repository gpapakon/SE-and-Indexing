<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a missile of the cargo-projectile type carrying a plurality of subassemblies, such as, in particular, munitions or payloads, arranged inside the body (1) of the missile having a generally cylindrical shape. This missile comprises a device for the control of the subassemblies (2), which is equipped with an electrical circuit comprising an independent energy source and a switch (6) which closes the circuit in the presence of the liquid. The control device comprises a central unit (5) managed by a microprocessor ensuring that the subassemblies (2) function according to a predetermined sequence, and a detector of the positioning of the missile in relation to the surface of the liquid medium. The missile comprises at least one self-destruction means (7). The application is particularly in the military sector as long-term marine marking devices.
