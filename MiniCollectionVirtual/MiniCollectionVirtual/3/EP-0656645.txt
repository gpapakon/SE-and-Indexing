<ABSTRACT>
A field effect transistor is fabricated with an ion implanted silicide layer 
(7) and a conducting diffusion barrier pad layer (9) that acts as a diffusion 

mask. The dopants from the silicide layer (7) are diffused into the substrate 
(1) to form shallow source/drain regions (21). Another silicide layer 

(11) is used because etching 
dielectric layer (13) and stopping on diffusion barrier layer (9) is 

often diffucult. Additionally, using WSi
2
 as the ion implanted 
silicide layer (7) saves one mask because phosphorous inhibits boron 

diffusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of field effect transistors and 
particularly to the field of such transistors that have sealed diffusion junctions. As integrated circuits have become more complex, the individual 
devices, such as field effect transistors, forming the integrated circuit have become 
smaller and more closely spaced to each other. Simple shrinkage of device 
dimensions was not alone sufficient to permit the increased complexity of the 
circuits; new processing technologies and innovative devices were also required. An example will illustrate this point. The source and drain regions of a 
field effect transistor must be separately electrically contacted. This is frequently 
done by depositing a dielectric layer over the transistor, patterning the dielectric 
layer to form windows which expose portions of the source/drain regions, and then 
depositing metal in the windows. A typical metal is aluminum. However, aluminum 
tends to diffuse or spike into the silicon substrate. Such diffusion is undesirable. 
Diffusion barrier layers are deposited between the substrate and the aluminum to 
prevent the diffusion and spiking. Deposition of the barrier layer material into the 
windows in the patterned dielectric frequently results in poor coverage of the 
substrate near the bottoms of the windows. Of course, the dielectric windows must 
be accurately positioned with respect to the source/drain regions. An innovative design which decreases the alignment accuracy required 
for the dielectric windows is described in United States Patents 4,844,776 and 
4,922,311 issued to K.-H. Lee, C.-Y. Lu and D Yaney. These patents describe both a 
device and a method for making the device which is termed a folded extended 
window field effect transistor and is commonly referred to by the acronym 
FEWMOS. In an exemplary embodiment, a layer of a conducting material, such as 
TiN, is blanket deposited after transistor elements, including an insulating layer on 
top of the gate electrode, are formed. The conducting material is patterned to form 
window or landing pads which cover at least portions of the source/drain regions. 
The window pads may be larger than the source/drain regions provided that they do 
not contact each other on top of the gate electrode; they may also extend onto the 
field oxide regions adjacent the source/drain regions. Improved tolerance for 
misalignment is obtained. The window pads act as etch stop layers when the 
windows in the dielectric are etched thereby preventing
