<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a liquid nutritional product
for enteral feeding of pulmonary patients and more specifically to a medical
nutritional product having a fat blend which is especially beneficial to patients
with respiratory insufficiency. The present invention also relates to a method
of improving pulmonary function in a mammalian creature having respiratory
insuffiency by enterally feeding the liquid nutritional product.Nutrition is an important consideration for the patient with respiratory
insufficiency. The incidence of malnutrition is high, both in patients with
chronic respiratory disease and those hospitalized with respiratory failure.
Malnourished patients have an increased susceptibility to infection, a
complication often resulting in mortality and morbidity in pulmonary patients.
Nutritional support helps to meet the caloric needs for respiration and to
maintain structure and function of respiratory muscle. In addition, the
maintenance of nutritional status has been associated with an increased ability
to wean patients from mechanical ventilatory support.Published reports of respiratory failure precipitated by high-carbohydrate
feedings have drawn attention to the carbohydrate and fat content of the
patient's diet. In patients with chronic or acute retention of carbon dioxide
(hypercapnia), one goal of dietary therapy is to decrease carbon dioxide
production. High carbon dioxide production can precipitate acute respiratory
failure in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and can complicate weaning
in ventilator-dependent patients. Because the complete combustion of fat yields
less carbon dioxide than combustion of either carbohydrate or protein, a high-fat
diet may be preferable for patients with pulmonary disease.Malnutrition is recognized as a major problem in hospitalized patients as
well as in outpatients with chronic diseases of long duration. There is
increasing evidence that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and respiratory failure suffer from malnutrition. Symptoms of respiratory
disease may limit caloric and nutrient intake, resulting in deterioration of
nutritional status over time. Poor nutritional status, in turn, negatively 
affects pulmonary function.The following observations are pertinent to the nutritional care of
patients with lung disease:
(a) Weight loss occurs in 25% to 65% of patients as a result of
inadequate caloric intake due to anorexia, shortness of breath, or
gastrointestinal distress, or 2) increased caloric
