<ABSTRACT>
A method of making dye stabilizers of the 
type of formula (A) below, using particular solvents 

and a non-aqueous workup, is provided. The dye 
stabilizer of formula (A) has a melting point of less 

than 150°C (and preferably less than 100°C) and is of 
the formula: 


wherein R, m, q, X, Y, r, and (R⁷)
n
 are defined in the 
specification. Such stabilizers are used in 

photographic elements which may also particularly 
contain a coupler which forms a yellow dye upon 

reaction with oxidized developer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silver halide
photographic elements and particularly to such elements
including stabilizers for the stabilization of dye
images produced in such elements.Color photographic elements typically contain
several records each with silver halide sensitized to a
different region of the visible light spectrum.
Generally, one record is sensitized to red light,
another green light and another, blue light. Each of
the foregoing records also contains a color coupler
which reacts with oxidized developer during processing
of the element, to produce a dye in a pattern
corresponding to the image to which the element was
exposed. In a typical element the red, green and blue
sensitive records respectively contain a cyan dye
forming coupler, a magenta dye forming coupler and a
yellow dye forming coupler. The color couplers are
typically provided in the form of droplets of a coupler
solution in an organic solvent, which droplets are
dispersed in the gel medium (typically gelatin) of the
element.The dyes that are formed by any color coupler
during processing have a tendency to fade over time
particularly as a result of exposure to light. As all
three image dyes of a typical color element fade, this
results in overall fading of the image over time. In
addition, since the three image dyes may not fade at
the same rate, an apparent change in image color also
results. Stabilizers are classes of compounds which
reduce the foregoing image dye fading problem. Known
stabilizers include phenols, bis-phenols, blocked
phenols, blocked bis-phenols, metal complexes and other 
compounds used in conjunction with many different color
couplers. Photographic elements containing the
foregoing color coupler and stabilizer combinations are
described, for example, in EP 0 298 321; EP 0 231 832;
EP 0 161 577; EP 0 218 266; EP 0 246 766; EP 0 508 398;

01137-258, JP 01144-048; JP 01152-456; JP 01289-952; US
4,782,011 and US 4,748,100.However, not all of the above types of
stabilizers are equally effective at stabilizing all
image-dyes. Furthermore, stabilizers of the above type
are not always synthesized with relatively high yield.
It is desirable then, to provide alternative methods
for synthesizing stabilizers of blocked bis-phenol
type. It is also desirable to provide photographic
elements which incorporate stabilizers which are
particularly effective at stabilizing the image dyes
formed as a result of processing the element.The present inventors have found that one of
