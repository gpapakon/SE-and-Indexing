<ABSTRACT>
A thermal ink jet printhead and method of 
manufacture wherein an ink feed opening (31) in a thin film 

substrate (10) is axially aligned with a central opening in a 
heater resistor (24, 26) disposed on the substrate. The ink 

feed opening (31) is also aligned with a firing chamber (30) 
formed in a barrier layer (28) disposed on the substrate and 

above and surrounding the heater resistor (24, 26), and is 
further aligned with an orifice opening (34) in an orifice 

plate (32) disposed on the barrier layer (28). This novel 
geometrical arrangement is operative to enhance the printhead 

ink ejection efficiency and to minimize cavitation wear on the 
heater resistors therein. In addition, the above axial 

symmetry may be provided by semi-circular heater resistors 
(24, 26), rectangularly shaped heater resistors (54, 56), or 

heater resistors of other shapes (36, 66) which are 
symmetrically arranged around the above firing chamber for the 

TIJ printhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to thermal ink jet 
(TIJ) pens useful in high speed computer driven ink jet 
printers and more particularly to such TIJ pens having 
improved ink feed and ink ejection characteristics and an 
improved heater resistor geometry and construction. Many different types of thermal ink jet pens have 
been developed since the introduction by Hewlett Packard 
Company in 1985 of the widely acclaimed Thinkjetâ„¢ printer 
which is described in detail in the Hewlett Packard Journal, 
Volume 36, No. 5, May 1985, incorporated herein by reference. 
One such type of pen and associated thin film printhead 
structure is described in my U. S. Patent No. 5,103,246 
entitled "X-Y Multiplex Driver Circuit and Associated Ink Feed 
Connection for Maximizing Packing Density on Thermal Ink Jet 
(TIJ) Printheads", issued April 7, 1992, assigned to the 
present assignee and also incorporated herein by reference. 
This commonly assigned patent is believed to represent the 
prior work and technology most relevant to the invention 
described and claimed herein. The invention disclosed and claimed in my above 
identified United States patent represents significant 
advances in the X-Y multiplex circuity for driving the TIJ 
pen, significant advances in increasing the printhead packing 
density on a thin film substrate, and also a significant 
improvement in the reduction of cross talk and improved cross 
talk isolation between adjacent heater resistors formed on a 
common thin film resistor printhead substrate.  The general purpose and principal object of the 
present invention is to provide still further new and useful 
improvements with respect to my above identified patented 
invention and improvements which are particularly directed to 
enhancing the ink ejection efficiency and life of the thermal 
ink jet pen, while simultaneously maintaining a high level of 
cross talk reduction between adjacent heater resistors formed 
on a common thin film printhead substrate. Another object of this invention is to provide a new 
and improved thermal ink jet pen and method of manufacture of 
the type described which features improved ink ejection 
directionality as a result of the axial symmetry used in pen 
construction. The presence of a symmetric firing chamber in 
the novel printhead structure disclosed and claimed herein is 
operative to create ink drops fired normal to the pen surface. 
This structure is to be contrasted with current and prior art 
systems which are asymmetric in geometry and make ink drop 
d
