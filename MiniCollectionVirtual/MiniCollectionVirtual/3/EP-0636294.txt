<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to telecommunications
systems, and more particularly to an electronic
digital signal processor-controlled
telecommunications system for the recognition of
spoken commands and for the directing of telephone
calls based on spoken commands.It is well-known that many of the safety
hazards of cellular telephone use could be
alleviated by utilizing automatic speech
recognition. While telephone-based speech
recognition systems are known, cellular voice
dialing over a mobile telephone exchange ("MTX")
presents significant challenges for two basic
reasons. First, the recognition technology must
accommodate a tremendous range of both
remotely-mounted and hand-held microphone types.
Second, the signal may be band-limited and degraded
in transmission to the MTX where the recognition
system will be located. Voice-controlled dialers of
the prior art, such as taught in U.S. Patent No.
4,853,953 to Fujisaki, have not been successfully
implemented in the cellular environment.There is therefore a need for voice recognition
systems for use in the cellular, satelite and
personal communications network environments that
overcome these and other problems of the prior art
and that facilitate the use of voice-dialing and
other safety and convenience features.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to describe an implementation of a speech
recognition system in a cellular or personal
communications network environment.It is a further object of the invention to
describe a speech recognition system for use at a
mobile telephone exchange (MTX) of a cellular or
personal communications network. The placement of 
the speech recognition system at the MTX
significantly reduces cost and increases reliability
by enabling the switch vendor to install and
maintain the system in conjunction with the cellular
switch.It is another object of the invention to
describe a cellular voice dialing system for use in
or in conjunction with an MTX of a cellular network.It is still another object of the invention to
use voice recognition techniques to secure access to
a cellular or personal communications network.Another object of the invention is to provide
for combined use of speaker-dependent and
speaker-independent voice recognition and speaker
verification techniques in an MTX of a cellular or
personal communications telephone network.These and other objects of the invention are
provided in an advanced system for the recognizing
of spoken commands over the cellular telephone or
any personal communications (i.e.,

<CLAIMS>
A mobile telecommunications system for connecting mobile
telecommunications customers, each having a mobile unit, to land-based

customers served by a telephone network (16), wherein incoming and
outgoing calls are routed through a mobile telecommunications switching

office (12) connected to a group of cell sites (14) adapted to communicate
with the mobile units (15), comprising a voice recognition system located at

the mobile telecommunications switching office, the voice recognition system
comprising:


a voice recognizer (41) for recognizing characters and commands
spoken by a mobile unit customer;
announcing means (42); and
processor means (40), operative under the control of a program stored
therein and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer of a first spoken

command from said mobile unit customer, for controlling the announcing
means to request said mobile unit customer to enter information identifying a

destination number to be dialed;
the processor means further operative under the control of said
program and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer of a second spoken

command from said mobile unit customer, for transferring the identifying
information received by the voice recognizer to the mobile

telecommunications switching office.
A mobile telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein
the voice recognizer includes means for verifying the mobile unit customer's

identify.
A mobile telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2
wherein the identifying information comprises one or more digits of the

destination number. 
A mobile telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2
wherein the identifying information comprises a keyword associated with the

destination number.
A mobile telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2
wherein the identifying information comprises a code associated with the

destination number.
A mobile telecommunications system as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the processor means is further operative under the control of the

program and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer (41) of a third
spoken command from the mobile unit customer; for controlling the

announcing means (40) to announce the identifying information received by
the voice recognizer to enable the mobile unit customer to verify the

information prior to issuing the second spoken command.
A mobile telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 6 wherein
the first spoken command is 
D
ial, the second spoken command is 
S
end and
the third spoken command is 
V
erify.
A mobile telecommunications system for connecting mobile
telecommunications customers, each having a mobile unit (15), to land-based

customers served by a telephone network (16), wherein incoming and
outgoing calls are routed through a mobile telecommunications switching

office (12) connected to a group of cell sites (14) adapted to communicate
with the mobile units, comprising a voice recognition system located at the

mobile telecommunications switching office, the voice recognition system
comprising:


a voice recognizer (41) for recognizing characters and commands
spoken by a mobile unit customer;
announcing means (42); and 
processor means (40), operative under the control of a program stored
therein and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer of a first spoken

command from the mobile unit customer, for controlling the announcing
means to request the mobile unit customer to enter information identifying a

destination number to be dialed;
the processor means further operative under the control of the program
and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer of a second spoken

command from the mobile unit customer, for controlling the announcing
means to announce the identifying information received by the voice

recognizer to enable the mobile unit customer to verify the information;
the processor means also operative under the control of the program
and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer of a third spoken command

from the mobile unit customer, for storing the identifying information received
by the voice recognizer for subsequent retrieval and use by the mobile unit

customer.
A mobile telecommunications system as described in Claim 8 wherein
the first spoken command is Dial, the second spoken command is Verify and

the third spoken command is Store.

processor means (40), operative under the control of a program stored
therein and responsive to receipt by the voice recognizer of a first spoken 

command from the mobile unit customer, for controlling the announcing
means to request the mobile unit customer to enter information identifying a

destination number to be dialed;
