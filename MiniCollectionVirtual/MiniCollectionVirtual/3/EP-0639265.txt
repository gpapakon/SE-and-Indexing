<ABSTRACT>
A device serving as an indicator of thermal history, namely for frozen products and the like, consisting of a container (10) of non-opaque material containing a fluid (12) with controlled viscosity as a function of temperature; a mobile portion (13) having a controlled geometry capable of moving in such a fluid as a result of a force applied by an elastic member (14); holding means (17) which can be released, designed to retain such a mobile member in an initial position at room temperature and when the device is frozen; the arrangement being such that after freezing and the release of such holding means the mobile portion is displaced in another position as a result of the force applied by said elastic member, in a time which is a function of the viscosity of the fluid; thus the device shows the thermal history of the frozen product and the like as a function of temperature elevations it has undergone, and the time elapsed since the holding means have been released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device useful as an 
indicator of thermal history, particularly for frozen 
products and the like. It is common knowledge that frozen foodstuffs 
should be kept at a predetermined low temperature, such 
as -18°C, for instance, within a comparatively narrow 
range, and should not in any case be thawed and frozen 
again. At present no means is available to check the 
actual thermal history of frozen products, namely 
frozen foodstuffs and the like. The consumer therefore 
must choose the goods from the frozen food section in 
food stores and cannot check the thermal history of the 
goods. Purchasers can only rely on notions of 
"confidence" totally deprived of any scientfic 
relevance. The same problem applies to a number of 
other items such as pharmaceutical products which must 
be kept at a temperature much lower than room 
temperature to retain their effectiveness. As far as these products are concerned there are 
no known means of telling first hand whether the 
pharmaceutical product has been exposed to temperature 
rises which might impare its properties. The purpose of the present invention is to provide 
an indicator of thermal history especially designed for 
frozen products and the like, which shows whether the 
product has gone through a rise in temperature in 
excess of the standards specified by the manufacturer, 
and might provide information concerning the time and 
the exposure to temperature variations in excess of the 
temperature recommended for a proper preservation. It is well known that the above products can be 
exposed to temperature rises without ever exceeding 0°C  
 
and retain, at least seemingly, their frozen state; 
however if at -18°C undesired biological processes are 
practically stopped, at -3 or -4°C such biological 
processes can take place, their occurrence being also a 
function of the time of exposure to a temperature 
higher than the recommended one, which as pointed out 
earlier is of about -18°C. The aim of the present invention is therefore to 
provide a device which displays the thermal history of 
frozen products, and that gives an indication of the 
time of exposure to a temperature higher than the 
recommended temperature. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a device based on the cooperation between an 
elastic element pre-loaded when the device is triggered 
and a fluid material with a controlled viscosity, which 
is a function of temperature; so that the indicator 
combined with the elastic member immediately

<CLAIMS>
A device useful as an indicator of thermal 
history, namely for frozen products and the like, which 

consists of a container (10), of non opaque material to 
accomodate a fluid (12) having a controlled viscosity, as a 

function of temperature; a mobile portion (13) having a 
controlled geometry which can move about in the fluid (12) 

as a result of a return force of an elastic component (14); 
holding means (17) which can be released, arranged to retain 

such mobile portion (13) in an initial position at room 
temperature and when freezing takes place; the set up 

being such that after freezing and the release of the 
restraining elements (17), the mobile component (13) is displaced 

and takes on a different position, as a result of the 
force applied by the elastic element (14), in a time which 

is function of the fluid viscosity, providing 
information on the history of the frozen product and 

the like, according to the temperature rises it has 
undergone and the time elapsed since the restraining 

elements have been released. 
An indicator according to claim 1 characterized 
in that the mobile component (13) operates as an indicator 

which can be seen outside the container. 
An indicator according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said elastic element consists of 

a spring. 
An indicator according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the mobile element (13) is of a 

definite size, fastened to said spring (14), consisting of a 
spiral spring, said mobile element (13) being made of a 

material with neutral buoyancy in such a fluid (12). 
An indicator according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the mobile element (19) has a definite 

size and is fastened to the spring which is a leaf 
spring (18). 
An indicator according to one or more of the above 
claims, characterised in that it consists of a pin (17) to  

 
be removed after freezing, positioned in such a way 

that the above elastic element (14, 18) is mechanichally 
stressed. 
An indicator according to claim 6, 
characterized in that self-sealing gaskets are provided 

in the area of the container (10, 10') which is to be crossed by 
the pin (17). 
An indicator according to claim 7, 
characterized in that said pin (17) is removed by applying 

concurrently a pulling force and localized heat (30).
