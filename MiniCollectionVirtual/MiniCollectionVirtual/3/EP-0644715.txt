<ABSTRACT>
Packaging of water-soluble polymer film is provided wherein crop protection chemical is dispersed within the thickness of the film, and the resultant film is either formed into a container to hold an incompatible crop protection chemical or laminated to another film within which is dispersed an incompatible crop protection chemical.

 WATER-SOLUBLE POLYMER PACKAGING FOR DELIVERY OF INCOMPATIBLE CROP PROTECTION CHEMICALS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the use of water- soluble polymer packaging for crop protection chemicals.The concept of delivering a single agricultural chemical in a water-soluble polymer is addressed in U.S. Patent 3,299,506 and British Patent 2,095,558. Each of these patents disclose a water-soluble polymer containing a uniformly dispersed chemical. The water-soluble polymer containing a chemical is formed into a thin film which can be torn or cut into measured sections for delivery of the chemical contained in the water-soluble polymer. The chemical is applied by placing the film on the ground or by adding the film to a predetermined amount of water in a sprayer. By these methods, the user is able to avoid contact with the chemical. It is often advantageous, however, to spray a field or garden plot with more than one chemical at the same time. For example, one chemical would kill broadleafed weeds while another chemical would kill grassy weeds . The problem of delivering incompatible crop protection chemicals has in the past been solved by delivering the chemicals in separate containers. Another solution has been the "twin pack" container which has two compartments for containing while physically separting two incompatible chemicals which are to be delivered simultaneously. These containers have the disadvantage that the container(s) must be rinsed and then subjected to disposal.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides packaging for simultaneous delivery of incompatible crop protection 

 2chemicals to a field or garden plot. For purposes of this invention, incompatible chemicals are those which when placed in contact with each other will cause one or both of the chemicals to decompose. The present invention takes advantage of the unique ability of a water-soluble polymeric film to encapsulate and immobilize a chemical, to provide a means for simultaneously delivering incompatible chemicals. The container for the incompatible chemicals is the water- soluble film. Since the container is water-soluble, there is no need for rinsing and disposal.The present invention provides packaging for storing and releasing incompatible crop protection chemicals, comprising: a) first and second crop protection chemical,

What is claimed is:
1. Packaging for storing and releasing incompatible crop protection chemicals, comprising: a) first and second crop protection chemical, said first and second chemicals being incompatible with respect to each other; and b) a container of water-soluble polymer film, said first chemical being encapsulated in said film and said second chemical being contained in said container; whereby upon solution of said film in water, said film and said container releases said first and second chemicals, respectively. 2. Packaging for storing and releasing incompatible crop protection chemicals, comprising a plurality of water-soluble films laminated to one another, a first crop protection chemical being encapsulated in at least one of said films and a second crop protection chemical incompatible with said first chemical being encapsulated in at least one other of said films so as to be stored separate from said first chemical, whereby upon solution of said films in water, said first and second chemicals are released into said water.
