<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing miniature components, especially pressure or similar sensors, consisting of at least two superimposed individual units (5, 8), a wafer (2) is produced having a plurality of individual semiconductor components (5). In addition a connecting component (4) is produced having a plurality of individual connecting units (8), in which the individual semiconductor units (5) and the individual connecting units (8) are of much the same size and are regularly arranged on the wafer (2) or the connecting component (4). All the individual units (5, 8) of the wafer (2) and the connecting component (4) are secured together in a single procedure step. This layered structure is then cut to form the miniature components. A connecting film with conductive tracks along webs can be applied to the individual semiconductor units (5) to provide their contacts.
