<ABSTRACT>
An opto-electronic system (1) for the acquisition of 
signals iindicating the presence of a voltage and its 

phase in distribution boards (QT), and generally in any 
medium voltage (MT) or high voltage (AT) installation by 

means of the use of optical fibres (F1, F2) of PVC with 
consequent elimination of the risks of electrocution and 

of the problems of transmission of the signals 
themselves. The system (1) employs an electro-optical 

convertor (EO) connected to a capacitive shunt (DC) for 
generating light signals indicative of the presence of a 

voltage and the phase angle on a conductor (FT) without 
making use of auxiliary sources of supply. The system (1) 

can also be integrated in an insulating rod (AIS) for 
checking overhead conductors (FT).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to systems for the
acquisition of signals indicating the presence of a voltage
and its phase in medium and high voltage apparatus, and
more specifically refers to a system as defined in the preamble
of Claim 1.At present in many medium and/or high voltage systems the
signal necessary for phase determination and for indicating
the presence of a voltage is taken off, by means of an
electric circuit, via a capacitive shunt applied externally
of internally to the insulating support and/or to an insulator
through which the conductor passes, or to the terminal
of the cable and/or to the female coupling insulator
thereof.The sinusoidal electric signal provided by the shunt in
question, which is characterized by a very modest short
circuit current value (from a few units to several tens of
micro amps) is utilized for:
supplying a voltage presence indicator device having
a gas discharge lamp,informing a phase concordance indicator device of
electronic type provided with an autonomous auxiliary supply
source,informing a voltage-presence indicator device of
electronic type provided with an autonomous auxiliary supply
source.In relation to the very modest current provided by the capacitive
shunt the transmission of electrical signals over
a distance, by means of an electric circuit even of modest 
length (several meters) becomes difficult. Moreover the arrangements
intended to satisfy the safety requirements for
the personnel responsible for the monitoring give rise to a
significant cost of auxiliary protection circuits and interfaces
for the indicator devices.In fact, given the voltages and currents present in the medium
and high voltage conductors, the possible loss of insulation
between the signalling system and the conductor,
in the absence of suitable protection systems, would produce
an electrical discharge of high intensity with serious
risks for a human operator who may be working on the circuits
for the purpose of verifying the phase synchronization
or whatever other purpose.Other high-voltage signalling systems are known, in which
the high voltage signal is sensed via the capacitive shunt
and the electrical signals originated therefrom are converted
into optical signals by means of an electro-optical
circuit, the optical signals being transmitted over a distance
by means of optical fibres, thus providing an electrical
insulation. An opto-electronic high-voltage signalling
system of this type is disclosed in the article
"Floating input, optically isolated,
