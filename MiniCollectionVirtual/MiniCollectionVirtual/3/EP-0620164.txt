<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a closure for a bottle which has a holding part (16), a sealing part (17), and a seal made of compressible material which is arranged between the annular sealing surface of the sealing part and an annular end face of the bottle neck (20) and, in the closed state, rests both against the sealing surface of the sealing part (17) and against the end face of the bottle neck (20) in the circumferential direction with different contact pressure. The method is characterised in that a sealing disc (18) made of compressible material is inserted into a cap, forming the holding part (16) and sealing part (17), with a flat sealing surface of the sealing part (17) and made of a deformable metal, in that the cap is fitted with the sealing disc (18) onto the bottle neck (20), in that a pressing ram (21) is pressed from the outside against the sealing part (17) of the cap, which pressing ram has on its end face projections (24) arranged spaced apart in the circumferential direction so that the sealing part (17) is deformed only at the points on these projections (24) in the direction towards the end face of the bottle neck (20) so that the seal is compressed to a lesser extent in the region of the non-deformed parts.

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a closure for a bottle or the 
like, which comprises a retaining part (16) having an 

inwardly directed projection or collar to engage behind 
an external swelling of a bottle neck (20), a sealing 

part (17) connected to the retaining part (16) and having 
a substantially annular sealing face, and a seal made of 

compressible material which is disposed between the 
annular sealing face and an annular end face of the 

bottle neck (20) and in the closed state abuts both the 
sealing face of the sealing part (17) and also the end 

face of the bottle neck (20) in the circumferential 
direction with varying contact pressure,
characterised in that
 a sealing disc (18) or a sealing 
ring of constant thickness and made of compressible 

material is inserted into a cap forming retaining part 
(16) and sealing part (17) and having a plane sealing 

face of the sealing part (17) and made from deformable 
metal, in particular aluminium,
in that
 the cap with the sealing disc (18) is placed onto 
the bottle neck (20),
in that
 a press die (21) is pressed from outside against 
the sealing part (17) of the cap, which on its end face 

comprises projections (24) disposed spaced from one 
another in the circumferential direction, so that the 

sealing part is deformed only at the locations of these 
projections (24) towards the end face of the bottle neck 

(20), with the result that in the region of the non-deformed 
parts the seal is compressed to a lesser extent. 
A method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 when the press die (21) is applied 
the collar for engaging behind an outer swelling of the 

bottle neck (20) is produced.
