<ABSTRACT>
The combing machine contains a can plate (21) and, above this, a coiler (19). A fibre sliver (F) coming from a drawframe of the combing machine is brought forward on a conveyor band (8). The conveyor band (8) runs around a first deflecting roller, which is arranged at the drawframe and which is driven jointly with this, and around a second deflecting roller (11) which is arranged above the coiler (19). Furthermore, a pair of calender rollers (14, 15) is arranged above the coiler (19). The second deflecting roller (11), which is driven by the running conveyor band (8), is coupled to one of the calender rollers (14) via a toothed belt (17). There is therefore no need for any separate drive connections to the calender rollers (14, 15).

<CLAIMS>
A combing machine, with a drafting arrangement 
(3), a rotatable can plate (21), a rotatable 

funnel wheel (19) disposed above the can plate, a 
conveyor belt (8) which is placed around a first 

deflection pulley (7) arranged at the drafting 
arrangement (3) and being jointly drivable with it 

and is placed around a second deflection pulley 
(11) arranged above the funnel wheel (19), and 

with a pair of calender rollers (14, 15) arranged 
above the funnel wheel (19), characterized in that 

one of the calender rollers (14) is coupled with 
the second deflection pulley (11) and is drivable 

thereby. 
A combing machine as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the one of the calender 

rollers (14) is coupled with the second deflection 
pulley (11) via a toothed belt (17). 
A combing machine as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the toothed belt (17) is 

arranged in an enclosed chamber and that means are 
provided for maintaining a pressure above 

atmospheric in this chamber. 
A combing machine as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the axis of the 

calender roller (14) extends approximately 
parallel to the axis of the second deflection 

pulley (11). 
A combing machine as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the second 

deflection pulley (11) has a diameter of more than 
50 mm, preferably a diameter of approx. 100 mm. 
A combing machine as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that adjacent to the  

 
first deflection pulley (7) there is arranged a 

pressure roller (9) which is drivable by the 
conveyor belt (8).
