<ABSTRACT>
Described are aqueous emulsions of active amino groups-displaying epoxide adduct hardeners for curing epoxy resin systems, which are obtained by converting an aqueous solution of a conventional hardener, which contains reactive amino groups and can emulsify the epoxy resin used for adduct formation, under increase of the amine-H-equivalent weight, to an emulsion by mixing with an epoxy resin having a functionality of 1,2-3,5. The viscosity generally is 5 to 40 Pa.s. The values lie on an emulsion viscosity curve with a rising and falling viscosity profile. The hardeners are especially suitable for curing aqueous epoxy resin systems and for application together with epoxy resins as additive for hydraulic binders such as cement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to aqueous hardeners in the form of aqueous
emulsions of active amino groups-displaying epoxy resin adducts, such
as polyamide-amine epoxide adducts or polyamine epoxide adducts and
the like, their preparation, and the use of same in curing epoxy resin
systems.Epoxy resins have long been known; it is a question, in that case, of
condensation products of epoxide compounds and polyvalent alcohols or
phenols which on account of their comparatively low molecular weight
still require curing. To this end use is made of compounds capable of
cross-linking the epoxy resin, i.e., which have at least two active
points in the molecule. Particular mention is to be made here of
compounds having two or more active hydrogen atoms such as polyamines
and corresponding polyamide-amines, as well as dicarboxylic acids,
cyclic dicarboxylic anhydrides, and the like.Such hardeners have been described in numerous patent specifications
and technical literature articles and are commercially available in
the market.Also known are hardeners which are obtained by the adduction of
epoxides or epoxy resins to corresponding substances having active
hydrogen atoms and which as adducts, moreover, have sufficiently
active amino groups to make the curing of epoxy resins into the end
product possible.Such adduct hardeners are described in, int. al., German Published
Application 2 361 671. These hardeners are obtained by reacting an
excess of polyamide-amine or polyamine with an epoxy resin. For the
curing process these adducts are either first of all dissolved as such
in water and mixed with a solution or dispersion of another polymer 
and then added to the epoxide to be cured, or mixed directly with the
dissolved or dispersed further polymer without previous dissolving.
Besides other shortcomings such as long drying times and insufficient
chemical resistance, an essential drawback to this process in many
cases is the fact that in addition to the hardener and the epoxy resin
to be hardened there must always be a third polymer component which,
furthermore, is not reactive.In European Patent Application 605 similar adduct hardeners are
described, which are composed of three elements, viz, a polyepoxide
compound, a polyalkenyl polyether polyol, and a polyamine. This
conversion product preferably is further reacted with a
mono-unsaturated compound, the adduct may be diluted with water
beforehand.Another hardener for epoxide compounds is described in European Patent
Application 387 418. In this case polyalkylene polyether

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of an aqueous emulsion of an active amino
group-containing epoxide adduct hardener for curing epoxy resin

systems, characterised by converting an aqueous solution of an
active amino-group-containing hardener, which

can emulsify the epoxy resin used for adduct formation, to an adduct emulsion
by mixing with an epoxy resin having an

epoxy functionality of 1,2 - 3,5 and a weight
average

molecular weight of at least 700, the epoxy resin in liquid form
being mixed with said solution so as to be emulsified thereby as

an adduct having an increased amino-H-equivalent weight.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the
mixing and conversion are carried out with vigorous stirring.
A process according to claims 1 or claim 2 characterised in
that dissolved hardeners having an amine-H-equivalent weight of 50

to 250 are employed.

that the amine-H-equivalent weight is raised by 10 to 250.
A process according to any one of claims 1-4, characterised in
that the emulsion is set at a viscosity of 5 to 40 Pa.s, measured

on a 50%-emulsion at 20Â°C.
A process according to any one of claims 1-5, characterised in
that the epoxy resin is added to the hardener

solution over a period of 5 to 20 minutes. 
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that
the hardener is an amine adduct, a polyamine adduct, an aliphatic polyamine, a

polyoxyalkylene diamine, a polyamidoamine, a Mannich base formed by the
condensation of a phenol, an amine and formaldehyde,

and/or a transaminated Mannich base.
A process according to claim 7 wherein the hardener is an amine adduct and the
epoxy resin is a diglycidyl ether resin of bisphenol A.
A process according to any one of claims 1-8, characterised in
that water and optionally present other volatile constituents may

be extracted wholly or in part from the aqueous emulsions prior to
their use in the curing of epoxy resins, more particularly for

storage and transport purposes, and that if so desired, water and
optionally the volatile constituents may be added again wholly, in

part, or in an increased amount at a later time
A process according to claim 9, characterised in that the aqueous
emulsions are subjected to spray drying.
Application of emulsions Produced according to any preceding claim together with epoxy
resins as additive for hydraulic binders such as cement.
