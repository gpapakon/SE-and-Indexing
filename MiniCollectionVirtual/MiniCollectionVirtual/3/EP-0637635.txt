<ABSTRACT>
A process for extracting metals from a flotation concentrate containing 
gold, platinum group minerals, copper, nickel and sulfur. The process 

involves roasting the concentrate in the presence of oxygen to reduce the 
sulfur content of the concentrate to approximately two percent; leaching the 

roasted concentrate with an acid solution containing hydrochloric and nitric 
acids to dissolve substantially all of the metals; and recovering the metals 

from the solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to metal recovery processes, and more
particularly, to processes to recover metals from a flotation concentrate
containing platinum group minerals and sulfur.Previous methods for recovering precious metals from a flotation
concentrate involve smelting the concentrate to produce a "matte" in which
metals values are further concentrated. The matte is then subjected to a
series of leaching steps to leach out the base metals. Generally, a separate
leaching step is used for each base metal to be removed. The precious metals
are then leached out and removed from each of the leaching solutions in
subsequent recovery steps.For example, GB 748,405 describes a method of recovering non-ferrous
metals, such as copper, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, lead,
gold, silver and zinc from high-sulphur and low arsenic content
metal sulphide concentrates containing ferrous and non-ferrous
metal values. The method comprises determining from the sulphur
and non-ferrous and ferrous contents and ratios a sulphur content
for a concentrate of the ore lower than its initial content which
will provide at least stoichiometric equivalents of sulphur to
metal sulphates of the non-ferrous metal values and yield a final
sulphate solution after leaching containing not more than 10%
sulphuric acid, roasting the ore under temperature and rate
conditions optimum for sulphur removal, stopping the roasting at a
residual sulphur content which is high enough to prevent
appreciable formation of insoluble "ferrite-type" compounds;
admixing with the roasted ore any necessary amount of sulphur to
produce a sulphur content in the mixture not less than said
predetermined content, leaching the so-treated material at
temperatures above the atmospheric pressure boiling point in the
presence of sufficient oxygen gas, and separating the insoluble
material from the liquor.U.S.-patent 4,188,362 discloses a process for the treatment of
platinum group metal concentrates such as matte leach residues and
the like, comprising the formation of an alloy of aluminium and
precious metals and recovering at least the majority of the
precious metals in solution by a suitable leaching procedure, using hydrochloric acid and chloride gas or as an alternative to chloride gas, nitric acid may be used thus forming Aqua Regia. The traditional process described above has several shortcomings.
Firstly, smelting is generally an environmentally undesirable process because
of the gasses given off and the problem of disposal of solid residue.
