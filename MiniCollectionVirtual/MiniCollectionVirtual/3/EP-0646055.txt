<ABSTRACT>
The novel process makes it possible to construct linear transfer installations without a special return transport system for workpieces or workpiece carriers, to keep the number of circulating workpieces or workpiece holders to a minimum and to increase or reduce the number of stations in the transfer installation at will. In the invention, a partial flow via any number of successive stations is organised by the alternating transfer in pairs between adjacent stations so as to produce both a forward and a return movement of workpieces or workpiece carriers (figure 2). To this end, dumb-bell-like double transfer devices (9) are used between all stations, only every other one of which is used alternately. An advantageous device for transfer is disclosed (figure 3).

A procedure for the phased transport of work pieces or work piece
carriers in transfer lines or transfer machines with any number of

stations in a linear arrangement between which the work pieces or work
piece carriers are moved alternately from one station to another by

means of pivoting double arms,
characterised in that
 a common input and output station is
provided and that in each transfer phase of the consecutively numbered

double arms either only the odd- or only the even-numbered double
arms are used alternately so that each double arm (8 / 9) has an

alternate function, while the neighbouring arm is in a parked position
and the work pieces or work piece carriers are transported out from the

first station through all the following stations to any given station and
back in reverse order with the reverse procedure by means of the same

double arm.
A transfer line or transfer machine with several machining stations in
a linear arrangement between which the work pieces (4a, 4b) or the

work piece carriers (5a, 5b) are moved alternately from one station to
another by means of pivoting double arms (8 / 9), whereby the number

of double arms is one less than the number of stations, and with
controllable fixing means (3a, 3b) for the work pieces (4a, 4b) or work

piece carriers (5a, 5b) and with a control device,
characterised in that
 a common input and output station is
provided and that of a series of consecutively numbered double arms (8

/ 9) the control device alternately uses either only the odd- or only the
even-numbered double arms. 
A device in accordance with Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the double arms (8 / 9) perform
rotational movements, with points of rotation of which lie between two

stations.
A device in accordance with Claim 3,
characterised in that
 all the points of rotation lie on a
straight line.
A device in accordance with Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the work pieces (4a, 4b) or work piece
carriers (5a, 5b) are held on the stations by supports (6a, 6b) which are

free to move in the direction of the straight lines described by two
neighbouring points of rotation.
