<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production of indelible script on a paper substrate provides for the introduction of at least one highly penetrating colouring compound having at least two reactive functional groups into the substrate in a vehicle as well as its subsequent polymerisation in situ in the substrate itself. To advantage to colouring compound is selected from oxidation dyes and its in situ polymerisation is achieved by oxidation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to a liquid
composition for the production of protected, indelible
script on a paper substrate.It is well known that ink script can be removed, even if
only partially, when it is subjected to suitable chemical
or physical action such as, for example, abrasion by
bladed instruments or fine points, decolouration with
suitable oxidising/reducing agents (including the common
"ink-eradicators"), laser light, etc.It is equally well known that there are recognised
solvents or mixtures of solvents which are able to remove
script, whatever ink has been used, without etching into
the substrate to which it has been applied and hence
without leaving any obvious trace of the removal.In order to protect ink script, particularly but not
exclusively on official documents, bank cheques and other
similar documents, from accidental or intentional
removal, particularly when this is unauthorised, many
techniques and devices have been proposed among which are
the covering of the script with a transparent film which 
is extremely adhesive to the paper substrate, which is
unaffected by the type of ink used for the script itself
and which is insoluble in the solvents for such ink.However, at least with regard to intentional,
unauthorised deletion, the techniques and devices adopted
up till now have had limited success over time and in the
field of application, that is, they have been useful
until countermeasures have been found to overcome their
protectiveness.A need has therefore been felt to prevent ink script
whether effected manually with a fountain pen, ballpoint
pen, felt pen, stamp or the like, or mechanically with a
printer, ink jet printer, post marking machine or the
like, from being deleted, even only partially, either
accidentally or intentionally.Document JP,A,1-75282 discloses an ink composition
containing (a) a water soluble dye and (b) a compound
which can be oxidized by singlet oxygen more easily
than the dye; such an ink shows an improved resistance
to visual light.Document JP,A, 76-29054 describes ink compositions
having water-proof properties obtained by mixing one or
more molecules selected from tannis, tannic acid,
gallic acid and pyrogallol, with a basic dye and one
or more neutral hydrophilic organic material in the
presence of an aqueous medium.JP,A,57-102971 discloses an ink composition
containing (1) a component which chemically dissolves
fibre materil e.g. sulphuric acid, a sizing agent
and/or a surface treating material constituting the
recording paper
