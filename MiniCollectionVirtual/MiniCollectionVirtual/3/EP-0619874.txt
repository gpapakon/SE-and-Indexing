<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for determining
emptying characteristics of a wet well system which is filled and emptied in cycles.Pump station flowmeters or the like are well
known in the patented prior art, such as the patent to
Jorritsma Nos. 4,455,870, 4,669,308 and 4,821,580;
Free et al No. 4,897,797, Hon No. 4,856,343, Adney No.
4,962,666 and the British patent No. 777,201.Pump stations are comprised of a wet well which
accepts liquid inflow and temporarily stores such
inflow, and a pump or pumps which discharge the
accumulated liquid from the wet well. The rate of
change of level in the wet well with respect to time
(dl/dt) is a function of the shape and size of the wet
well, the flow entering the wet well (inflow or Qin),
and the flow leaving the wet well (outflow or Qout).The shape and size of the wet well are known, and
therefore if dl/dt is measured, it can be converted to
the rate of change of volume with respect to time 
(dV/dt). The rate of change of volume depends on the
inflow and outflow as follows:
dV/dt = Qin - QoutEquation 1 can be rearranged to depict that if
dV/dt and the inflow are known, the outflow can be
calculated, or if dV/dt and the outflow are known, the
inflow can be calculated. When the wet well pump (or
pumps) are off, the outflow is known to be zero, and
dV/dt is a direct measure of the inflow.While the pump (or pumps) are off, the inflow can
be measured by timing how long it takes for the inflow
to fill a known volume. This can be done by using
existing upper and lower limit switches which are
already present to turn the pumps on and off. This
method simply provides an average inflow over the time
that it takes to fill the known wet well volume.If the inflow is also known during the pump on
time, the total volume passed through the wet well in
one wet well pump cycle can be calculated by the
equation:

where V1-4 is the volume of the wet well between the
pump on and pump off switches and t4-1 is the length of
time that the pumps were on. It is important to note
that the inflow is a function of time and is not a
constant. If an average inflow for the pump on time
is what is known, then a numerical version of equation
2 would be used: 
Volume/cycle = V1-4 + (Qin) (t4-1)Unfortunately, timing the wet well fill up will
give an average inflow which is not an accurate
estimate of inflow during the pump on time if the
inflow is significantly increasing or decreasing
between the pump off time and pump on time. One way
to reduce this error is to add another level
