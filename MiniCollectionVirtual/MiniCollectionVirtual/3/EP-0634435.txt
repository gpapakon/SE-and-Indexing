<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
polyesterification catalyst system. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a polyesterification 
catalyst system comprising a phosphorus component and a 
titanium compound. Most particularly, the present 
invention relates to a polyesterification catalyst system 
comprising a complex of a phosphorus compound and a 
titanium compound; and to blends of polyesters prepared 
with these catalysts with polycarbonate resins. Polyesters, such as poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) or PET, and poly(butylene terephthalate) 
or PBT, are widely used in the preparation of articles by 
forming methods such as injection molding and tube 
extrusion. Many of their properties, including chemical 
stability, solvent resistance and low permeability to 
gases, make them attractive candidates for such forming 
operations as blow molding, profile extrusion and 
thermoforming. It is also well known in the art to blend 
polyesters with other resins to provide other useful 
properties. Polybutylene terephthalate is commercially 
blended with aromatic polycarbonates and other 
ingredients, such as rubbers, for applications requiring 
high toughness and ductility, combined with resistance to 
deformation under load at elevated temperatures. However, it has been found that during the 
preparation of the polyesters or during the processing of 
blends of polyesters and polycarbonates at the required 
high temperatures, chemical interactions, such as estercarbonate 
interchange reactions, occur resulting in  
 
reduced strength and increased mold cycle times. These 
chemical interactions are promoted by the activity of the 
residual titanium ester-based polyesterification catalyst 
employed during the synthesis of the polyester. Previous attempts in the prior to overcome 
these shortcomings have included employing chelate 
catalysts during the preparation of the polyesters. For example, McCready, United States Patent No. 
4,452,969 teaches using a titanium-containing chelate 
prepared by the reaction of a tetraalkyl titanate with a 
substituted carboxylic acid derivative such as methyl 
salicylate, malic acid, glycine or dibutyl tartrate. 
Similarly, Brunelle, United States Patent No. 4,452,970 
teaches employing a titanium-containing chelate catalyst 
prepared by reacting a tetraalkyl titanate with an ortho-substituted 
hydroxyaromatic compound. Other attempts in the prior art have included 
adding stabilizers after the esterification reaction 
stages. For example, Saiki et al.,
