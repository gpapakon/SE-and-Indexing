<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing damage and lesions at the interface between two solid or liquid media, particularly at the interface between a liquid medium and the tissue of a living being or a solid medium such as a membrane, or at the interface between a solid medium such as a membrane and the tissue of a living being, as well as an apparatus for implementing said method, are described. The apparatus includes a pressure wave generating device (12) provided with a membrane (16) defining a cavity which is completely filled with a coupling liquid (18). The inner (19) and outer (20) surfaces of the membrane (16) are coated with an agent (24) for reducing damage or lesions at said interface, said agent preferably consisting of a silicone oil. The method may be used in pressure wave generating apparatuses for performing extracorporeal treatments without causing damage or lesions, even when operating at maximum power.
