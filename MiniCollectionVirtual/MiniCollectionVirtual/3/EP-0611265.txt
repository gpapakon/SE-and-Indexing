<ABSTRACT>
An automatic distributor of stacked packages of the 
type comprising two lines of stacking means (6,6a) 

counterfaced and spaced apart from each other, 
having their respective outlets counterfaced and 

leading to the inside of the distributor; two lines 
of delivery means (41, 41a) operating respectively 

in each row of stacking means (6, 6a), with each 
delivery means (41, 41a) normally sliding in respect 

to the longitudinal axis of the distributor; 
operating means (48, 48a) designed to engage and 

operate said delivering means (41, 41a) in 
accordance with commands received; and conveying 

means (67, 67a, 69) situated between said two rows 
of stacking means (6, 6a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an automatic 
distributor of stacked packages. At present, there are known distributors for the 
automatic delivering of various packages which are 
previously stored in stacks after having been 
selected, set in order and controlled. The European Patent Application published under the 
number EP-A-0 383 000 describes such a distributor 
comprising a modular store with increased density of 
vertical stacking constituted by a longitudinal 
crosspiece provided with equidistant joints designed 
to hold vertical walls that define the packages 
width. The vertical walls are provided with equidistant 
grooves in which other vertical walls, transversal 
to the precedent ones, are inserted defining the 
package depth. In this way a vertical channel is formed in which 
the in-box goods are stacked. Moreover, the above 
mentioned distributor, provides a plurality of 
expellers inserted in modular channels, made in a 
bottom plane of the distributor, to expell the 
product situated at the bottom of the vertical 
stacking channel, said expellers being operated by 
an electronic control.  Other distributors proposed for the automatic 
distribution of packages and/or constructive details 
related to them are described in the patents: EP-A-0 037 989, DE-C-1.001.813, EP-A-0 192 206, 
FR-A-2.248.217 and US-A-3.631.992. Generally, the above mentioned distributors present 
various disadvantages in construction, operation, 
changing of the packages size, maintainance and have 
enormous size, as well. Such disadvantages result mainly from the fact that 
the driving means are situated in places not easily 
accessible, therefore the operations of assembly, 
adjustment, size change and maintainance are 
complicated and expensive. Furthermore, for each longitudinal line of stacked 
packages a conveyor is required and the adjustment 
of the transversal section of the vertical channel 
used for stacking requires various operations, that 
is removal and fixing of the walls that form the 
channel. The object of the present invention is therefore, to 
overcome the above reported disadvantages. The invention, characterized in claims, overcomes 
the above reported disadvantages. The advantages of the present invention result 
essentially from the fact the driving means are  
 
situated in places easily accessible, therefore in 
the phase of assembly, adjustment, size change and 
maintainance the operations are easier. Furthermore, a single conveyor is required to carry 
the articles delivered from the

<CLAIMS>
An automatic distributor of packages of the type 
comprising stacking means with vertical channels for 

the stacking of the packages, delivering means for 
the delivery of at least one single package from the 

respective stack of packages, operating means for 
operation of the delivering means in accordance with 

commands received, and conveying means for 
transporting the delivered packages to a collecting 

zone, characterized in that it includes: 

two rows of counterfacing stacking means (6, 6a) 
spaced apart from each other, having their 

respective outlet facing each ohter and leading 
towards the inside of the distributor; 
two rows of delivering means (41, 41a) operating 
respectively in each row of stacking means (6, 6a), 

with each delivery element (41, 41a) normally 
sliding in respect to the longitudinal axis of the 

distributor and operating in at least one packages 
(11, 11a) stacking channel; 
conveying means (67, 67a, 69) situated between 
said two rows of stacking means (6, 6a). 
Distributor according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said two rows of stacking means (6, 6a) are 

inclined and convergent upwards. 
Distributor according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the channels of said stacking means inlcude 

"omega" or "hat"-shaped elements (6, 6a) placed 
substantially vertically and longitudinally side by 

 
side in respect to the distributor, with their 

coplanar wings (9-10, 9a-10a) extending toward 
inside the distributor, in such a way that between 

the two adjacent profiled section bars (6-6, 6a-6a) 
a channel, substantially vertical, is formed, having 

the unloading wall, i.e. the wall turned toward 
inside the distributor, delimited by the two wings 

(9-10, 9a-10a) of the two adjacent profiled section 
bars (6-6, 6a-6a), and the side walls delimited by 

substantially vertical, counterfaced planes of the 
same two adjacent profiled section bars (6-6, 

6a-6a). 
Distributor according to claim 1, characterized
