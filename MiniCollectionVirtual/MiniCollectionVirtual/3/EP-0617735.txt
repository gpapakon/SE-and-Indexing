<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a free flowing perfume capsule composition with enhanced performance and stability from slurries containing perfume capsules is described. A process comprising removing water from the slurry to form a wet cake, combining silicone dioxide or aluminosilicate to the wet cake to fluidize the wet cake and removing additional water from the fluidized wet cake to form free flowing perfume capsules is preferred.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing a perfume 
capsule composition using silicone dioxide or aluminosilicate. 
More particularly, this invention relates to a method for 
preparing a free flowing perfume capsule composition which 
improves the drying time of a wet cake containing perfume capsules 
and enhances perfume performance and stability. Detergent compositions containing perfume are well known in 
the art. The perfume is ordinarily mixed or admixed with the 
liquid or granular detergent composition. Perfume makes the 
composition more aesthetically pleasing to the consumer, and in 
some cases it imparts a pleasant fragrance to surfaces. Most 
consumers have come to expect detergent compositions to have a 
pleasing odor. Because perfumes are made of a combination of volatile 
compounds, perfume can be continuously emitted from simple 
solutions and dry mixes to which it has been added. Various 
techniques have been developed to hinder or delay the release of 
perfume from compositions so that they will remain aesthetically 
pleasing for a longer length of time. For example, see West 
German Patent 825,293, Dec. 17, 1951; 
and U.S. Patents 3,772,215, issued Nov. 13, 1973: 
and 3,567,119, issued Mar. 2, 1971. While such methods have been 
somewhat effective, there is still a need to economically 
formulate a composition which emits perfume from the composition 
and the treated surface even after product storage. Encapsulation techniques have been used to enclose the 
perfume so that the fragrance is not emitted during storage and it 
is noticeable after actual use of the product, when the 
encapsulating material dissolves or breaks and the perfume is  
 
released. Storage of encapsulated perfume, though, can result in 
loss of the perfume stored within by capsule breakage and/or 
vaporization of the perfume core through the capsule wall. Microencapsulation techniques are known for perfumes, 
medicines, adhesives, dyestuffs, inks, fertilizers, etc. See for 
example U.S. Patents 4,446,032, Munteanu et al., issued May, 1984; 
4,288,460, Ciliberto et al., issued September 8, 1981; 4,268,411. 
Iwata et al., issued May 19, 1981 and 4,081,264, Ali, issued March 
28, 1978. Microencapsulation techniques and materials for 
forming microcapsules are disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,800,458.

A method of preparing a perfume capsule composition 
comprising; 


(a) obtaining or preparing a slurry comprising, by weight, 
from 5% to 60% of perfume capsules and from 40% to 80% of water; 

said perfume capsules having an average particle size of between 1 
µm and 450 µm and essentially consisting of a perfume 

core encapsulated by an outer coating; said perfume core being 
comprised of viscous perfume and perfume carrier; 
(b) removing 
an amount of said water from said 

slurry sufficient to form a wet cake comprising, by weight, from 
15% to 35% of water and from 60% to 85% of said perfume capsules; 
(c) combining, preferably by rotating, ribbon blending, drum 
mixing, or baffled drum blending, with said wet cake from 0.1% to 

10%, by weight of said wet cake, of silicone dioxide or 
aluminosilicate particles having an average particle size of from 

0.1 µm to 150 µm; and 
(d) removing, preferably by filter belt drying, centrifuging 
or dry pressing, an amount of water from the product of step (c) 

sufficient to form a free flowing composition comprising, by 
weight, from 1% to 15% water and from 80% to 99% of said perfume 

capsules. 
The method according to Claim 1 wherein said outer coating of 
step (a) is a shell selected from the group consisting of gelatin, 

gum acacia dextrin, modified food starch, wax, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, urea formaldehyde polymer; and mixtures thereof. 
The method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said perfume carrier of step (a) is a water soluble 

C
12
-C
24
 fatty alcohol or fatty ester, or mixtures thereof. 
The method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein in step (b), the amount of water is removed by filter 

belt drying. 
The method according to claim 4 
wherein said wet cake of step (b) contains from 22% to 30% water.  

 
The method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said silicone dioxide or aluminosilicate particles have an 

average particle size from 1 µm to 50 µm and said perfume 
capsules of step (a) have an average particle size of 150 µm. 
The method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said perfume capsule outer coating of step (a) is

-C
20
 fatty alcohol. 
The method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said wet cake of step (c) is combined with from 2.5% to 

5%, by weight, of fumed or precipitated silicone dioxide or 
aluminosilicate particles. 
The method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said perfume capsules of step (a) essentially consist of

core. 
A granular laundry detergent composition comprising;

c) from 1% to about 50% of other standard 
ingredients; and
