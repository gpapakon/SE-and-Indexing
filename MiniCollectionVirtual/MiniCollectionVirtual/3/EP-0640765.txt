<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises: a branch (5) from the outlet (M) of the 
pump to a cavity (7) partially delimited by a membrane (14); a 

moving element (16, 22, 24) in a casing (9); a spring (36) 
pushing said element (16, 22, 24) toward the membrane (14) and 

capable of yielding under the action of a relatively restricted 
pressure of the water which reaches said cavity (7) and acts on 

the membrane; and moving electrical contacts (26) on said element 
(16, 22, 24), interacting with fixed contacts (28) of a supply 

circuit of the pump, to enable the pump to be switched on and to 
switch it off in the absence of pressure acting on the membrane 

(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electromechanical device capable 
of automatically checking the presence of water in a domestic 
distribution circuit of a building, of an industrial installation 
or other, for the protection of the circulating pump of said 
circuit. There are known mechanical or electronic devices, which, 
when installed in various types of waterworks, provided with a 
pressure and capacity stabilizing system, check the constant 
presence of water within a supply network, but these present 
problems particularly when the flow of water becomes 
insufficient. In this case the installed device, which no longer 
detects the presence of water owing to a lack of pressure or 
flow, sends the starting input to the corresponding pump of the 
plant, designed to keep the internal pressure constant, in order 
to reach a minimum level for correct usage. Said pump continues 
to run until the necessary conditions for optimal operation are 
re-established, or the correct internal pressure is reached. 
Consequently, when there is insufficient water in the town supply 
network or in the cistern, and therefore in the absence of water 
flow in the corresponding plant, the pump continues to operate, 
obviously without a load, with a serious risk of damage to the 
pump. Other problems may arise simply from the presence of 
electronic devices, which, moreover, are not always reliable or 
easily understood for correct installation by all hydraulic 
engineers. In order to avoid and eliminate the problems mentioned 
above, without altering in any way the installation system or the 
operating characteristics of the waterworks in general, the 
electromechanical device to which the invention relates has been 
developed, and is easily understood, simply fitted and highly 
reliable, particularly in wet areas such as those where these  
 
gadgets are fitted. The device protects the pump from damage due 
to a lack of water flow through the pump. Substantially, the electromechanical device according to the 
invention (for protecting the pump in case of accidental absence 
of water) comprises: a branch from the outlet of the pump to a 
cavity formed in a base and partially delimited by a membrane 
trapped between said base and a casing; a moving element in said 
casing joined to said base; spring means pushing said element 
toward the membrane and capable of yielding under the action of 
even a relatively modest pressure of the water which reaches said 
cavity and acts on the membrane; moving electrical contacts on 
said

<CLAIMS>
An electromechanical device for protecting a pump in case 
of accidental absence of water, comprising: a branch (5) from the 

outlet (3) of the pump to a cavity (7) formed in a base (1) and 
partially delimited by a membrane (14) trapped between said base 

(1) and a casing (9); a moving element (16, 22, 24) in said 
casing (9) joined to said base (1); spring means (36) pushing 

said element (16, 22, 24) toward the membrane (14) and capable 
of yielding with a relatively restricted pressure of the w
ater 
which reaches said cavity (7) and acts on the membrane; moving 

electrical contacts (26) on said element (16, 22, 24), 
interacting with fixed contacts (28) of a supply circuit of the 

pump, to enable the pump to be switched on and to switch it off 
in the absence of pressure acting on the membrane (14). 
The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said moving 
element (16, 22, 24) is provided with a member (24) for manual 

operation. 
The device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said moving 
contacts (26) are elastic and capable of bridging pairs of 

corresponding fixed contacts (28). 
The device as claimed in claim 1 or 2 or 3, wherein said 
moving contacts are carried by a cross-piece (22) of said moving 

element (16, 22, 24), guided in longitudinal grooves (12A) in the 
casing (9). 
The device as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims, comprising in said element (16, 22, 24) a part in the 

form of a piston (16) with a rod (16A), and comprising an annular 
seal (34) around said rod (16A), to form a seal between the 

chamber (10) of the piston (16) and that (12) containing the 
contacts (26, 28). 
The device as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims, comprising a timer (TP) which keeps the pump active for 

a predetermined period after the actuation of the manual 
operation member (24).
