Apparatus and process for improving 
atomization and combustion of fuel containing solid 

particles, wherein the fuel containing solid particles 
is ejected from an outlet port (11) having a conical or 

trumpet end-like internal wall surface and a fuel 
atomizing fluid is ejected from a plurality of bores (13) 

present in the conical or trumpet end-like internal 
wall surface of the outlet port.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
apparatus and processes for combusting fluid fuel
containing solid particles and, more particularly, to
apparatus and processes for combusting liquid fuel
contaminated by solid particles, e.g., liquid waste
containing solid particles.Conventional burners generally comprise fuel
passageways for emitting fluid fuel and oxidant
passageways for emitting oxidant, as shown by, for
example, U.S. Patent No. 5,104,310 and Brazilian Patent
No. 8,503,088. The fluid fuel, such as oil, employed
in the conventional burners is normally filtered before
it is ejected through the fuel passageways of the
conventional burners. By filtering the fuel, the fuel
is prevented from clogging the fuel passageways. When
the fluid fuel involved is heavy oil or liquid waste,
filtering it adequately for the fuel passageways of the
conventional burners is very difficult, if not
economically unfeasible. Often, this fluid fuel can
contain solid particles with a dimension of up to 10
mm, which can clog, block or obstruct the fuel
passageways of the conventional burners. In order to prevent such fluid fuel from
clogging the fuel passageways, a nozzle assembly
capable of passing a fluid fuel containing solid
particles is employed to eject the fluid fuel. The
nozzle assembly has a fuel or waste passageway having a
diameter which is larger than the size of the largest
particles in the fluid fuel. U.S. patent No.
5,129,333, for example, discloses a centrally located
waste nozzle assembly for ejecting waste matter
gravitationally, mechanically or pneumatically. This
nozzle assembly is not indicated to be used for
ejecting waste matter containing solid particles. If,
however, it is used to eject waste matter containing
solid particles having dimensions of up to 10 mm, the
nozzle assembly must have a large diameter passageway
capable of conveying or passing such solid particles.
The large diameter passageway, however, adversely
affects atomization or dispersement of the fluid fuel.
Since failure to atomize or disperse fluid fuel
sufficiently can prevent complete and stable combustion
of the fluid fuel, a substantial amount of a fluid fuel
atomizing or dispersing fluid, such as steam or air, is
needed under substantial pressure to atomize or
disperse the fluid fuel from the nozzle having the
large diameter passageway. Accordingly, there is a genuine need for
effective and efficient atomization or dispersement of
the fluid fuel containing solid particles, e.g., liquid
waste contaminated with solid

A process for combusting fluid fuel containing solid particles, the process comprising:

(a) ejecting said fluid fuel containing solid particles through a nozzle (3) having an
outlet port (11) defined by a conical or trumpet end internal wall surface;
(b) ejecting a fluid fuel atomizing or dispersing fluid through a plurality of bores (13)
located at said conical or trumpet end internal wall surface of said outlet port,

thereby thrusting or pushing said fluid fuel containing solid particles just before
said fluid fuel leaves said outlet port, thus enhancing atomization or dispersement

of said fluid fuel containing solid particles; and
(c) combusting the resultant atomized or dispersed fluid fuel containing solid
particles with oxidant;

characterized in that

said fluid fuel atomizing or dispersing fluid is oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen;
and
the process further comprises partially combusting said fluid fuel with said fluid
fuel atomizing or dispersing fluid by forming a substantially homogeneous

mixture containing said fluid fuel and said fluid fuel atomizing or dispersing fluid,
before being combusted with said oxidant in step (c).
The process according to claim 1, wherein said fluid fuel is liquid waste containing solid
particles.
The process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said fluid fuel atomizing or dispersing
fluid is ejected at an angle ranging from about 30째 to about 60째, measured from the

horizontal axis of said nozzle (3) and at a volumetric rate at sonic velocity ranging from
about 30 nm
3
/hour to about 70 nm
3
/hour.
A burner capable of burning liquid fuel containing solid particles, said burner
comprising:


(a) a nozzle (3) having a passageway (9) capable of passing liquid fuel containing
solid particles and an outlet port (11) having conical or trumpet end internal wall

surface, said conical or trumpet end internal wall surface being in fluid
communication with said passageway and having a plurality of bores (13) radially

spaced from the central axis of said passageway, said bores having a diameter or 
cross-sectional area smaller than the diameter or cross-sectional area of said

passageway; and
(b) a housing means (5) surrounding said nozzle (3) and being coupled to said outlet
port (11) to form an annular passageway (15) which is in fluid communication

with said bores (13);

characterized in that

said housing means (5) has a discharge end
section which extends beyond the outer end of said outlet port (11) to form a chamber

(17) capable of accommodating partial combustion of liquid fuel containing solid
particles.
The burner according to claim 4 further comprising

an additional housing means (7) surrounding said housing means (5) to form an
additional annular passageway (19) therebetween for passage of oxidant.
The burner according to claim 4, wherein said bores are slanted at an angle ranging from
about 30째 to about 60째, measured from the horizontal axis of said nozzle (3) and have a

diameter ranging from about 1.5 mm to about 3 mm.
