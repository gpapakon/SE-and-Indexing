<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to catalyst supports,
supported catalysts and methods of making and using them
in heterogeneous catalytic reactions.Heterogeneous catalytic reactions are widely
used in chemical processes in the petroleum,
petrochemical and chemical industries. Such reactions
are commonly performed with the reactant(s) and
product(s) in the fluid phase and the catalyst in the
solid phase. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, the
reaction occurs at the interface between phases, i.e.,
the interface between the fluid phase of the reactant(s)
and product(s) and the solid phase of the supported
catalyst. Hence, the properties of the surface of a
heterogeneous supported catalyst are significant factors
in the effective use of that catalyst. Specifically, the
surface area of the active catalyst, as supported, and
the accessibility of that surface area to reactant
chemisorption and product desorption are important.
These factors affect the activity of the catalyst, i.e.,
the rate of conversion of reactants to products. The
chemical purity of the catalyst and the catalyst support
have an important effect on the selectivity of the
catalyst, i.e., the degree to which the catalyst produces
one product from among several products, and the life of
the catalyst. Generally catalytic activity is proportional to
catalyst surface area and high specific area is therefore
desirable. However, that surface area must be accessible
to reactants and products as well as to heat flow. The
chemisorption of a reactant by a catalyst surface is
preceded by the diffusion of that reactant through the
internal structure of the catalyst and the catalyst
support, if any. The catalytic reaction of the reactant
to a product is followed by the diffusion of the product
away from the catalyst and catalyst support. Heat must
be able to flow into and out of the catalyst support as
well.Since the active catalyst compounds are often
supported on the internal structure of a support, the
accessibility of the internal structure of a support
material to reactant(s), product(s) and heat flow is
important. Porosity and pore size distribution are
measures of that accessibility. Activated carbons and
charcoals used as catalyst supports have surface areas of
about 1000 square meters per gram and porosities of less
than one milliliter per gram. However, much of this
surface area and porosity, as much as 50%, and often
more, is associated with micropores, i.e., pores with
pore diameters of 2 nanometers or less. These pores can
be inaccessible because of
