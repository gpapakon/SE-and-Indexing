<ABSTRACT>
When viewing in parallel to a cylinder center axis (3), a 
combustion expanding gas injected from an injection hole (4) 

is adapted to form a pair of valve recesses (10),(11) located 
on the opposite sides of an injection axis (12) of said 

injection hole (4). A pair of valve recesses (10),(11) are 
formed concavely in a piston top surface (8) so as to be 

separately disposed on the opposite sides of the injection 
axis (12) of the injection hole (4). Respective swirl 

centers (14),(15) of a pair of swirling gas flows (6),(7) are 
located within said pair of valve recesses (10),(11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a divided chamber type 
diesel engine. Generally a divided chamber type diesel engine has the 
following construction. That is, a cylinder head is provided 
with a divided chamber while a main combustion chamber is 
formed within a cylinder. An injection hole is formed in the 
cylinder head eccentrically to a center axis of the cylinder 
so as to be declined toward the center axis of the cylinder. In one of such engines, a pair of valve recesses are 
formed concavely in a top surface of a piston. In this 
engine, since a volumetric ratio of the valve recesses 
relative to an entire volume of the main combustion chamber 
becomes comparatively large when its piston is near to a top 
dead center, it is expected that much air accumulated locally 
within the valve recesses and a combustion expanding gas 
injected from the injection hole can be mixed effectively so 
as to improve a combustion performance. Actually, however, 
the combustion performance is not so much improved in 
comparison with an engine having no valve recesses. It is 
supposed that the reason is that the mixing between the air 
within the valve recesses and the combustion expanding gas is 
not carried out effectively.  
 GB-A-2160262, DE-A-3314662 and JP-A-1012023 describe swirl 
type diesel engines. In these specifications, fuel is 
injected from one side of a cylinder head and is then guided 
towards a pair of valve recesses in the cylinder head in 
which swirling gas flows are generated. It is an object of the present invention to mix an air 
within a valve recess and a combustion expanding gas 
effectively in a divided chamber type diesel engine. For accomplishing the above-mentioned object, the present 
invention is constructed as follows. For example, as shown in Figure 1 corresponding to a first 
embodiment of the present invention, a cylinder head 23 is 
provided with a divided chamber 1 while a main combustion 
chamber 5 is formed within a cylinder 22. An injection hole 
4 is formed in the cylinder head 23 eccentrically to a 
center axis 3 of the cylinder 22 so as to be declined toward 
a center portion of the cylinder 22. According to the invention there is provided a divided 
chamber type diesel engine having a cylinder head provided 
with a divided chamber, a cylinder provided with a main 
combustion chamber, an injection hole connecting the divided chamber (1) to the main combustion chamber (5) formed in said 
cylinder head at an eccentric position relative to a 
cylinder center axis, said

eccentric position relative to a cylinder center axis (3), 
said injection hole (4) being oriented to a center portion
