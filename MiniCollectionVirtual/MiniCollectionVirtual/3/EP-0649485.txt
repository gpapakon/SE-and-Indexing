<ABSTRACT>
In a method for temporary mounting of heavy structural parts (2) on a load-bearing support structure (1) in the correct position for subsequent permanent assembly, elastic spring elements (4) are used between the structural parts (1, 2), the number of elements being determined by the spring force of the elements and the weight of the structural part. As spring elements (4), elements are used where an elastic spring effect is directed substantially in the vertical direction, the elements' resistance to the influence of force being greater in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for mounting of heavy structural 
parts on a load-bearing support structure, where force-absorbing 
elements are provided between the structural part and 
the support. When erecting large structures it has become increasingly 
expedient to construct the structures in separate parts which 
are later assembled to form the total structure. Particularly 
in connection with offshore structures, e.g. platform structures, 
the base and the actual platform part have each been 
constructed separately and put together after the base has been 
placed in the water. Accommodation units and the like have also 
been built in segments which are subsequently assembled. The 
assembly of such large, heavy structures is difficult to 
perform. There are a number of critical factors which must be 
taken into account during this operation in order to prevent 
faults from arising in one of the structural parts. A flexible 
assembly should preferably be performed and during the assembly 
it should be possible to make allowance for the fact that those 
surfaces which are intended to abut on each other may not be 
identical, so that it must be possible to compensate for 
irregularities. If the assembly is out of alignment or if 
irregularities occur between the elements, dangerous stress 
could arise in the completed structure, possibly leading to 
critical situations, e.g. in an offshore structure in bad 
weather. In order to achieve a correct balance it is also 
important to ensure that loads are distributed evenly over the 
support. Another feature which should also be considered during the 
assembly of large or heavy structural parts is that during the 
assembly operations there can easily arise lateral moments 
which can result in an incorrect assembly and hence subsequent 
problems with the actual structure, wiring, etc.  
 Until now the principal means of solving the above-mentioned 
problems has been the use of plastically deformable distance 
pieces. An example of the state of the prior art can be found 
in Norwegian patents no. 140 537 and no. 168 492. In the former Norwegian patent the use is proposed of plastically 
deformable metal pipes as mounting elements between the 
upper and the lower structural parts. In NO patent 168 492 the use is proposed of mounting elements 
which are plastically deformable and which are designed in the 
form of laminated blocks, at least one of which consists of 
lead or of a metal with corresponding plastic properties. These known plastically deformable

<CLAIMS>
Method for temporary mounting of heavy structural parts on a load-bearing support structure, 
in the correct position for subsequent permanent assembly, where force-absorbing 

elements are positioned between the structural part and the support, the number of 
such elements being determined by the absorbing force of the elements and the 

weight of the structural part, characterized in that as force-absorbing elements are used 
elastic spring elements (4) being positioned in such a way that the elastic spring effect 

is directed substantially in the vertical direction, and such that the resistance of the 
spring elements (4) to the influence of force is preferably greater in the horizontal direction than 

in the vertical direction, said elements (4) are provided with spring arcs which are 
preferably provided between two plates which are placed with the plates facing the 

respective structures and where spring arcs are provided in groups, where the arc in 
each group is placed at an equal angle, but where each spring element contains several 

groups at opposite angles. 
Method according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the used spring elements (4) are provided in a pattern which will cause 

resistance from the spring elements (4) to lateral forces in all directions. 
Method according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the spring arc is provided at an angle to the plates' longitudinal 

direction. 
Method according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the used spring elements (4) are provided in such a way that 

all spring arcs are defined with the 
same angle, said elements being distributed over the joining surface for the structural 

parts in such a manner that distorting joining forces are counteracted.
