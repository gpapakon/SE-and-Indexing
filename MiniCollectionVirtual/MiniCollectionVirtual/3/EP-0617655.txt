<ABSTRACT>
In a razor (10) with a handle-like lather container (12) and detachable cap (22) that covers and can be moved relative to a lather discharge valve (18) of the lather container (12), which valve is enclosed by a linking ring (70), at least two projecting catches (50, 50a) are devised as guide pieces in the cap (22) approximately radially opposite each other on either side of a central pin (42), and can each be sunk into a corresponding slot (72) in the linking ring (70), each slot (72) being separated from a guide surface of the linking ring (70) by a bead. Each slot (72) can be flanked by two beads, which are adjoined by a wedge-shaped, upwardly inclined surface.

<CLAIMS>
Razor device, especially a disposable razor, having a
handle-like foam container (12) as well as a cap (22)

detachable from the latter moulded by means of a neck
(24) on to a razor blade head (26), which cap covers a

foam outlet valve (18) surrounded by a connecting ring
(70) of the foam container and is attached movably

relative to the latter into a foaming position, wherein
the edge surface of the connecting ring surrounding the

foam outlet valve contains a moulding moulded into the
ring equipped with a guide surface (68) containing an

elevation and a slot (72) parallel to the axis as a
latch seat for an opposing member (50) on the cap-side

in the foaming position and a channel (44) in a central
plug (42) of the cap is assigned to a valve tube (16)

of the outlet valve of the foam container which plug is
connected to an opening (47) provided on the back

surface of the cap or of the neck, and wherein the
guide surfaces for the latch projection are provided

with a latching region for fixing the latch projection
in a latching position,

characterised in

that in the cap (22) at least two latch projections
(50, 50
a
) are situated approximately radially opposite
one another as opposing members which can each

simultaneously be lowered into a slot (72) in the
connecting ring (70), each slot being separated from

the guide surface (68) of the connecting ring by means
of a radial bead rising up on it, and wherein for each

latch projection (50, 50
a
) a latching region for the
shaving position constructed as a latch slot (84) is

provided.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
latch slot (84) is bounded by a barrier (82) moulded

out of the guide surface (68) as well as a stepped face 
(76).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
two radial beads (74) flank the slot (72) and at least

one wedge area (69) having an inclined surface extends
from a bead of one slot to a bead of another slot.
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that an
upwardly inclined wedge area (69) proceeds from each of

the two beads (74) and both wedge areas form a radial
crest line (92) and/or a plurality of crest lines lie

on a common diameter (B).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the latch projections (50, 50
a
) are reduced in
cross-section towards their free edge (51
).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the height of the bead (74) and/or of the

barrier (82) corresponds to the distance (n) of the
guide surface (68) from the annular surface (78).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised by a ratio of the distance (n, b) of

the guide surface (68) or of the shoulder (73) of the
annular surface (78) of the connecting ring (70) to

its distance (m) from the lowermost of the slots (72)
of 1:5 and/or by a ratio of the arc length of the

guide surface (68) to the arc length of the preceding
annular surface (78) of 1:1 or of 4:1.
