<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is an inertia switch with an inertial mass which is suspended by springs (1) from a mounting block (7). The springs are designed as curved flexure springs. If an acceleration acting on this sensor exceeds a critical value, the inertial mass is displaced appreciably from its position of rest. In this case, the inertial mass acts via a lever (17) to pull a contact bar (21) against a contact block (4) so that a current path is formed between the two parts of the contact block (4).

Inertia switch, in particular for measuring an 
impact of a motor vehicle, which has a spring-mass system 

with at least one spring (1, 2) and at least one inertial 
mass (10 to 13), at least one contact block (3 to 5) and 

at least one bearing block (6, 7) being secured on an 
insulating substrate (14), the spring or springs (1, 2) 

together with the inertial mass or masses (10 to 13) 
secured thereon being connected to the bearing block 

(6, 7), the inertial mass (10 to 13) and the spring (1, 
2) being at a distance from the substrate (14), the inertial 

mass (10 to 13) and the contact block (3 to 5) being 
at a smaller distance from one another and being composed 

at least partially of a conductive material, the contact 
block (3 to 5), the bearing block (3, 7), the spring 

(3, 2) and the inertial mass (10 to 13) having walls 
which are predominantly perpendicular to the substrate 

(14), and a contact closing when a predetermined acceleration 
value is exceeded, characterized in that the 

spring-mass system deviates only slightly from its starting 
position in the case of accelerations which are 

smaller than a predetermined acceleration value and flips 
into a deflected position when the predetermined acceleration 

value is exceeded, and then returns from the 
deflected position to the starting position when a second 

predetermined acceleration value, which is smaller than 
the first acceleration value, is undershot. 
Inertia switch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that at least two springs (1, 2) are used, in 

that the springs (1, 2) are designed as bending beams,  
 

the thickness of which is small relative to their length. 
Inertia switch according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the springs (1, 2) have one or more curves 

in the starting position of the spring-mass system. 
Inertia switch according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the springs (1, 2) project into recesses

Inertia switch according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the contact between the 

inertial mass (10 to 13) and the contact block (3 to 5)

springs (1, 2) and the inertial mass (10 to 13). 
Inertia switch according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the contact block (4) has two 

mutually insulated parts, between which the contact is 
closed when the inertial mass (12 to 13) closes a contact 

with both, giving rise to a current path from one part of 
the contact block (4) to the other part of the contact 

block (4) via the inertial mass (10 to 13). 
Inertia switch according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the inertial mass (11, 13)

in that the contact beam (21) is elastically 

attached. 
Inertia switch according to Claim 7 or Claim 8, 
characterized in that a lever (16, 17) is placed between 

the weight (20) and the contact beam (21).

characterized in that the lever (16, 17) is suspended 

from at least one holding spring (30) and in that the
