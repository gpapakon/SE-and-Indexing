<ABSTRACT>
The reactor (3) is provided with accesses (10,65) for 
introducing shredded tyres and oil into the reactor. There 

are egresses (120,140A) from the reactor for discharging the 
tyre oil and for discharging unreacted elements. Screens (73) 

are located within the reactor to separate the unreacted 
components of the shredded tyres from the tyre oil. The 

unreacted elements are removed from the reactor through two 
interconnected conduits (140A,160) each containing respective 

screw augers (101,163). The reactor also includes a heater 
(130) which heats the inside of the reactor to a temperature 

sufficient to cause a reaction between the shredded tyres and 
the oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reactors in general and,
more particularly, to a reactor for a tyre liquefaction
process in which shredded tyres and oil are reacted together
to provide tyre oil.US-A-5,070,109 relates to the recovery of hydrocarbon
products from elastomeric products, such as vehicle tyres by
a batch process treatment thereof. A reactor vessel, which is
provided with heating means, has a loading chamber with top
and bottom openable hatches and means for opening the bottom
hatch to load products to be treated into the reactor. The
reactor contains a bath of a hydrocarbon liquid heat transfer
medium maintained at an elevated temperature. Pieces of tyre
are loaded into a wire mesh basket provided in the hot liquid
bath and are subjected to thermal cracking therein. Hot
hydrocarbon gases are vented from the top of the reactor.
After the process is completed, heavy liquid separated from
the tyre is run off from the bottom of the reactor and the
basket containing pieces of steel cord from the tyres, is then
separately removed therefrom.EP-A-0 019 389 describes pyrolysing shredded tyres in
which residues are removed by a plurality of screw devices
inclined at an angle.The object of the invention is to provide an improved
method and apparatus for treating shredded tyres to produce
tyre oil, which facilitates removal of the separated,
unreacted components from the reactor.The invention provides a tyre oil reactor which reacts
shredded tyres and oil to produce tyre oil, comprising:
(a) first inlet means for receiving shredded tyres; (b) second inlet means for receiving oil;(c) heating means for heating the inside of the reactor
to a temperature sufficient to cause a reaction between the
shredded tyres and the oil to produce tyre oil;(d) separating means located within the reactor for
separating unreacted components of the shredded tyres from the
tyre oil;(e) discharge means for discharging the tyre oil from
the reactor; and(f) removal means for removing the unreacted components
from the reactor, which comprises
a substantially horizontal first conduit means affixed to
the reactor;a substantially vertical second conduit means connected
to the first conduit means;a first screw auger means, having a portion located
within the reactor and the remaining portion within the first
conduit means, for moving the unreacted components from the
reactor through the first conduit to the second conduit;a first motor means connected to the first screw auger
means for driving the first screw auger means so as to

<CLAIMS>
A tyre oil reactor which reacts shredded tyres and
oil produce tyre oil, comprising:


(a) first inlet means for receiving shredded tyres;
(b) second inlet means for receiving oil;
(c) heating means for heating the inside of the reactor
to a temperature sufficient to cause a reaction between the

shredded tyres and the oil to produce tyre oil;
(d) separating means located within the reactor for
separating unreacted components of the shredded tyres from the

tyre oil;
(e) discharge means for discharging the tyre oil from
the reactor; and
(f) removal means for removing the unreacted components
from the reactor, which comprises


a substantially horizontal first conduit means affixed to
the reactor;
a substantially vertical second conduit means connected
to the first co
nduit means; characterized in that;
a first screw auger means, having a portion located
within the reactor and the remaining portion within the first

conduit means, for moving the unreacted components from the
reactor through the first conduit to the second conduit;
a first motor means connected to the first screw auger
means for driving the first screw auger means so as to remove

unreacted components from the reactor;
a second screw auger means located within the second
conduit means for preventing binding of the unreacted

components exiting the first conduit means and for moving the
unreacted components so as to discharge the unreacted

components; and
a second motor means connected to the second screw auger
means for driving the second screw auger means.
A reactor as described in Claim 1 wherein the
separating means includes a pair of screens located within the 

chamber means at a predetermined angle with the vertical, and
a bottom element connecting said screens to facilitate the

movement of the unreacted components down the screens to the
bottom element to be removed by the removal means while the

tyre oil passes through the screens to the discharge means.
A reactor as described in Claim 2 wherein the
screens are metal plates having holes of a predetermined

diameter drilled in a predetermined arrangement so as to
facilitate the passage of the tyre oil through the screens

while preventing the unreacted components from passing
through.
A tyre oil reaction method which reacts shredded
tyres and oil to produce tyre oil comprising the steps of:


introducing shredded tyres into a reactor;
introducing oil into the reactor;
heating the inside of the reactor to a temperature
sufficient to cause a reaction between the shredded tyres and

the oil to produce tyre oil;
separating unreacted components of the shredded tyres
from the tyre oil within the reactor;
discharging the tyre oil from the reactor; and characterized in that
removing the unreacted components from the reactor by
using a first screw auger means in a substantially horizontal

first conduit means to move the unreacted components from the
reactor through the first conduit means and through a

substantially vertical second conduit means connected to the
first conduit means and containing a second screw auger means.
