<ABSTRACT>
A VCR or laserdisc player (100) includes circuitry (110) 
for detecting a code provided by VCR tapes, tape cassettes, or laser 

videodiscs, which indicates that the material recorded on the 
videotape or videodisc has been recorded in a compressed fashion to 

enable proper playback on a 16 X 9 television receiver (150). In 
response to detection of this code, the VCR or laserdisc player applies 

a DC signal to the chrominance output terminal (C) of its S-Video 
connector. Circuitry in the television receiver (150) detects the DC 

signal on the chrominance terminal (C) of its S-Video input connector, 
and controls a wide-screen processor to expand the image by 

displaying it over the entire width of the 16 X 9 display screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns video signal sources, such as, VCRs
and laserdisc players which may play television pictures
previously recorded in widescreen (i.e., 16 by 9 aspect ratio)
format..NTSC television instruments having 16 X 9 aspect ratio
picture tubes and format converters to convert 4 X 3 aspect ratio
NTSC signals to a form suitable for display on a 16 X 9 display are
now available. It therefore becomes desirable to have VCR tapes
that play back signals electrically in the NTSC format but which
were optically produced in a 16 X 9 aspect ratio. These signals
may be produced by special lenses or by 16 X 9 CCD imagers. U. S.
Patent US-A-4,897,722 (Flory), entitled WIDESCREEN TELEVISION
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM UTILIZING CONVENTIONAL EQUIPMENT
INCLUDING A CAMERA AND VCR, issued 30 January 1990,
discloses a system in which a
conventional NTSC format video camera utilizes an anamorphic
lens to optically produce images in a 16 X 9 aspect ratio. That is,
the anamorphic lens compresses the image horizontally by a
factor of 4/3, which is the exact amount need to compensate for
the expansion of a 4 X 3 aspect ratio NTSC image by a factor of
4/3 which automatically occurs when it is displayed on a wider 16
X 9 aspect ratio display screen.If a such an optically-compressed NTSC video signal is
played back to a standard 4 X 3 television receiver, the image
would appear correct in height, but compressed in width, or
"skinny". However, as noted above, a horizontal expansion of 4 X
3 aspect ratio signals occurs automatically when these signals are
displayed on a 16 X 9 aspect ratio display screen because the time
to scan a single horizontal line in both aspect ratios is the same.
In other words, the same amount of video data is spread out over
a greater distance in the same amount of time as the electron 
beam scans across the longer distance of the 16 X 9 aspect ratio
display screen.Unfortunately, if a standard 4 X 3 image is displayed
on a 16 X 9 display screen, the same automatic horizontal
expansion takes place, making everything appear "fatter". In
order to prevent this undesirable display, the 4 X 3 image is
typically displayed on the 16 X 9 display screen in its proper 4 X
3 aspect ratio, by displaying blank vertical bars on each side of
the 4 X 3 image to fill up the remainder of the 16 X 9.
International patent application PCT/ US91/03746, filed 29 May
1991, published as WO-A-91/19397 on 12 December 1991, (Willis),
entitled SYNCHRONIZING SIDE BY SIDE PICTURES,
discloses a system in which a 4 X 3
image is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A video signal processing arrangement comprising:

a video signal output (Y, C) for providing a video
signal;
detecting means (110) for detecting a widescreen aspect ratio of
the video image represented by said video signal;
signal generating means (115) for generating an
indication signal representing said aspect ratio;
characterized in that
said video signal output comprises a separate
chrominance output terminal (C) and a separate luminance

output terminal (Y) for providing chrominance and
luminance signal components of said video signal

separately; and
in that means (R101, C1, SW1, R102) are provided for
superimposing said chrominance signal component with said

indication signal in response to said detecting means
(110), wherein the indication signal is a DC signal.
The arrangement of claim 1 wherein:

said detecting means (110) reads a code recorded on a
recording medium.
The arrangement of claim 1 wherein:

said detecting means (110) senses a physical
characteristic of a recording medium.
