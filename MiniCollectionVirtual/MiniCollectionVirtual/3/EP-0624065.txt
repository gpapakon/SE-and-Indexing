A device for automatically processing mushrooms of given caliber 
Cal, the device including conveyor means (10, 20, 30) designed to 

bring said mushrooms to at least one processing station (100
i
) 
including detection means (110
i
) suitable for determining a parameter 
relating to each mushroom, a processing member (120
i
) for processing 
the mushrooms individually over a given processing distance C
i
, and 
control means (130
i
) suitable for bringing the processing member 
(120
i
) into operation after a response time Tr
i
 and as a function of 
the parameter determined by said detection means (110
i
), the device 
being characterized in that said conveyor means include a "receiver" 

first set of belts (10) designed to receive the mushrooms at a given 
mean flow rate D not greater than min[1/Tr
i
] and driven at a speed V₀ 

not less than Cal x D, an "accumulator" second set of belts (20) 

driven at a speed V₁ selected to be substantially equal to Cal x D, 
and a "separator" third set of belts (30) driven at a speed V₂ 

selected to be not less than 
max[C
i
/[1/D-Tr
i
]]
. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that it also 
includes at least one presser belt (200₁, 200₂) on the path of said 

separator belts (30) and running at the speed V₂ for the purpose of 
holding said mushrooms against said separator belts (30). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that one of 
the processing stations of said device is a station (100₂) for 

cutting the stems (1) of the mushrooms and comprising detection means 
(110₂) suitable for determining the length of the stem of each 

mushroom, a cutting member (120₂) for individually trimming the 
mushrooms over a given trimming distance C₂, and control means (130₂) 

having a response time Tr₂ and suitable for adjusting the relative 
position of the cutting member and of the mushroom stem as a function 

of the length of the stem as determined by said detection means 
(110₂).
