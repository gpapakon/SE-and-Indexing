<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to health and beauty aid
compositions in the form of gels and more particularly
relates to heterophase thermally reversible mineral oil
gels, preferably white oil gels, useful as vehicles for
health and beauty aids such as cosmetics. The
compositions contain blends of block copolymers, the
copolymers being preferably derived from styrene-rubber
block copolymers.The current methodology for producing mineral oil
containing gels includes the use of metal soaps,
surfactants (microemulsions), homopolymers, ionic
homo- and copolymers and block copolymers. Some common
gelling agents for cosmetic oil systems are fatty acid
soaps of lithium, calcium, sodium, aluminum, zinc and
barium. A number of homo- and copolymers have been
used to gel hydrocarbon systems at certain polymer
treatment levels including atactic ethylene-propylene.
Homopolymers or copolymers which have pendant salt
groups also form ion rich aggregates in a non-polar
matrix. The ionic interaction and resultant polymer
properties of these compositions, however, are
dependent on the type of polymer backbone, type of
ionic moiety and type of cation. Sulfonated 
polystyrenes exemplify this kind of system. Surfactant
combinations have also been used to gel mineral
oil/water systems. Surfactants are used at about 30 wt%
to gel oil and to gel 1:4 oil and water mixtures.
Nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan
monoleates exemplify these type of systems.Block copolymers are also known to form physical
cross-links to gels by selective sulfation and
subsequent phase separation of a particular block.
Block systems including styrene-isoprene, styrenebutadiene
and styrene ethylene oxide copolymers have
been used for this purpose. For example, U.S. Patents
3,867,533, 4,465,663, 4,678,664 and 4,721,579 of BASF
disclose aqueous cosmetic gels prepared from
polyoxybutylene-polyoxyethylene or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene
block copolymers. In addition, the
following U.S. Patents disclose compositions which
include various other types of block polymers:

improved gels of this type for health and beauty aids
such as cosmetics in view of various problems with the
prior art vehicles. For example the metal stearates in 
certain surfactants are
