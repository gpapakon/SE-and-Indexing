<ABSTRACT>
Process for analysing and measuring the concentration of solid particles emitted at the exhaust of diesel engines, in which the gas sample withdrawn at the outlet of the said exhaust is separated into two parts, the first (10) being maintained at a temperature in the region of that at which the gas sample is emitted by the exhaust and the second (20) being cooled below a predetermined temperature starting from which a fraction of the unburnt hydrocarbons contained in the fluid state in the sample is condensed before passing into a filter (25) capable of retaining the solid particles contained in the said sample. By means of a technique for optical measurement of absorption at a number of wavelengths, one of which is used to distinguish the absorption due to the soots from that due to the hydrocarbons, the concentration of soots and the total concentration of unburnt hydrocarbons are measured in the first route (10) and the concentration of unburnt, uncondensed hydrocarbons is measured in the second cooled route (20). The application also relates to a device for the implementation of this process.

Method for analysing and measuring the concentration of 
the solid particles emitted in the exhaust of Diesel 

engines, in which the sample of gas taken at the outlet of 
said exhaust is separated into two parts, the first being 

maintained at a temperature equal to or greater than a 
predetermined value, beyond which the non-burned 

hydrocarbons are in a gaseous phase and the second being 
cooled to below a predetermined temperature beyond which a 

fraction of the non-burned hydrocarbons contained in the 
fluid state in the sample is condensed before passing into 

a filter capable of retaining the solid particles contained 
in said sample,
 
characterised in that it comprises the following steps: 


measuring the absorption by each of the two fractions 
of the sample of a light ray emitted by an appropriate 

source for two predetermined wavelengths: 

a wavelength (L
1
) representing a peak specific 
absorption of hydrocarbons, 
a wavelength (L
2
) situated outside the peak 
specific absorptions of any non-solid constituent 

likely to be present in a significant quantity in 
the analysed gases, 
converting the measurements made on the fraction of 
sample maintained at a high temperature in order to 

deduce therefrom: 

at wavelength (L
2
), the concentration of soot, 
at wavelength (L
1
), the concentration of soot and 
total non-burned hydrocarbons,  

 
through the difference between the two preceding 
results, the total concentration of non-burned 

hydrocarbons, 
converting the measurements made on the fraction of 
refrigerated sample in order to deduce therefrom: 


at wavelength (L
1
), the concentration of 
non-condensed hydrocarbons, 
at wavelength (L
2
), the state of the filter 
contained in this measurement line, 
finding the difference between the concentration of 
total hydrocarbons and the concentration of non-condensed 

hydrocarbons, in order to obtain the 
concentration of condensed hydrocarbons, 
adding the concentration of condensed hydrocarbons and 
the concentration of soot in order to obtain the total 

concentration of solid particles contained in the 
analysed gas sample. 
Analysis and measurement method according to Claim 1,
