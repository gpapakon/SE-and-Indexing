<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methylene-substituted 
heterocyclic compounds which are novel and have utility as 
insecticides and acaricides. The invention also relates 
to insecticidal and acaricidal compositions, to the use of 
such compounds and compositions as insecticides and 
acaricides, to the preparation of such compounds, and to 
novel intermediates, and their preparation. The invention relates in particular to novel 
heterocyclic compounds having a haloalkylcarbonylmethylene 
substituent. DE-A-3639877 discloses insecticidal and ectoparasitic 
heterocyclic compounds containing a 5- or 6- membered 
ring, as defined therein, the ring having at least one 
ring nitrogen atom, the ring being substituted by a group 
of general formula =Y-CO-CF₃ where Y represents a nitrogen 
atom or a group of general formula CR³ where R³ represents 
hydrogen or a group of formula -CO-CF₃. It has now been found that compounds having the group 
-CF₂-X where X is a halogen substituent, but not fluorine, 
or is a haloalkyl group, can give rise to insecticidal and 
acaricidal properties which could not have been predicted, 
from the properties of the equivalent known compound 
wherein X is fluorine, or from the properties of the 
equivalent CCl₃-containing compound. In accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a compound of the general 
formula  wherein X represents a methylene group, or a sulphur atom 
or a group of general formula NR¹ wherein R¹ represents a 
hydrogen atom a C₁₋₄ alkyl group or a C₁₋₅ acyl group;
 
n represents 2 or 3;
 
m represents 0, 1 or 2;
 
A represents an optionally substituted heteroaryl group; 
and
 
R represents a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or a C₁₋₄ 
haloalkyl group. Included within the scope of the present invention 
are standard derivatives of compounds of general formula 
I such as salts and oxides, for example N-oxides. Compounds of general formula I may exist in a number 
of stereo-isomeric forms and tautomeric forms (e.g. keto-enol 
forms and cis-trans isomeric forms) and all such 
forms fall within the scope of the present invention. Generally, when any of the above mentioned moieties 
comprises an alkyl group, the alkyl group may be linear or 
branched and may suitably contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
suitable examples being methyl, ethyl and propyl. When 
any groups are designated as being optionally substituted, 
the substituent groups which are optionally present may be 
any of those customarily employed in the development of 
pesticidal compounds,
