<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine comprises two cylinder blocks (2), each defining one or more cylinders (4), each cylinder in each cylinder block reciprocably accommodating a piston (6) and being opposed to a cylinder in the other cylinder block. The two cylinder blocks (2) are connected together with the interposition of two or more crankcase structures (18, 20) and define between them a space in which a crankshaft (12) is rotatably supported by at least two main bearings (26) which are at least partially supported by the crankcase structures (18, 20). Each opposed pair of pistons (6) is rigidly connected by two walls (8) which afford respective apertures and which define between them a space. Each opposed pair of pistons is connected to two cranks (16) of the crankshaft (12) by two sliders (14) which are accommodated in a respective one of the said apertures and are mounted to slide with respect to the associated wall (8) only in the direction transverse of its reciprocal movement and which define an opening in which a respective one of the cranks (16) is rotatably received. A main crankshaft bearing (26) is supported in the said space between the two walls (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal 
combustion engines and is particularly concerned with 
the positioning and bearing arrangements for the 
crankshaft of such engines. The invention relates to 
that type of engine which comprises two cylinder 
blocks, each defining one or more cylinders, each 
cylinder in each cylinder block being opposed to a 
cylinder in the other cylinder block, the two cylinder 
blocks being connected together with the interposition 
of two or more crankcase structures and defining 
between them a space in which a crankshaft is rotatably 
supported by at least two main bearings which are at 
least partially supported by the crankcase structures, 
a piston mounted to reciprocate in each cylinder, each 
piston being connected to a crank of the crankshaft (see for example FR-A-1 423 850). 
Whilst the invention is principally concerned with four 
stroke engines of spark ignited type, particularly 
engines for racing cars, it is applicable also to those 
of two stroke and/or diesel type. Reciprocating piston engines include one or more 
pistons which are mounted to reciprocate in respective 
cylinders and are typically connected by respective 
connecting rods to a crankshaft accommodated within a 
crankcase defined beneath the cylinder block. This 
construction is inherently relative large and heavy. 
Furthermore, the engine exerts a considerable torque on 
its mountings during acceleration and has a 
considerable rotational inertia which can lead to 
catastrophic failure in the event of the engine seizing 
during high speed operation.  
 Engines of the generic type referred to above with 
the cylinders in the so-called flat configuration are 
known. The necessary connecting rods and relatively 
large cranks on the crankshaft are bulky and heavy and 
this is highly undesirable in racing car engines in 
which it is always desired to produce more power from 
an engine of given size and weight, i.e. a more compact 
engine with an improved power to weight to ratio. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a reciprocating piston engine which is smaller 
and lighter than known engines and thus has a higher 
power output per unit weight and per unit volume and a 
further object to provide such an engine which is 
perfectly balanced at all times and has no net 
rotational inertia. According to the present invention, an internal 
combustion engine of the type referred to above is 
characterised in that each opposed pair of pistons is 
rigidly connected by two walls which

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine comprising two 
cylinder blocks (2), each defining one or more cylinders (4), 

each cylinder in each cylinder block being opposed to a 
cylinder in the other cylinder block, the two cylinder 

blocks being connected together with the interposition 
of two or more crankcase structures (18,20) and defining 

between them a space in which a crankshaft (12) is rotatably 
supported by at least two main bearings (26,31) which are at 

least partially supported by the crankcase structures, 
a piston (6) mounted to reciprocate in each cylinder, each 

piston being connected to a crank (16) of the crankshaft, 
characterised in that each opposed pair of pistons (6) 

is rigidly connected by two walls (8) which afford 
respective apertures and which define between them a 

space, that each opposed pair of pistons is connected 

to two cranks (16) of the crankshaft (12) by two 
sliders (14) which are accommodated in a respective one 

of the said apertures and are mounted to slide with 
respect to the associated wall (8) only in the 

direction transverse of its reciprocal movement and 
which define an opening in which a respective one of 

the cranks (16) is rotatably received, a main 
crankshaft bearing (26) being supported in the said 

space between the two walls (8). 
An engine as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that each piston (6) is of annular 

shape with an axial hole passing through it, that the 
two cylinder blocks (2) are connected together by one 

or more fastening members (24), each of which passes  
 

through a respective opposed pair of pistons and that 
each fastening member (24) at least partially supports 

a main crankshaft bearing (26) in the space between the 
two walls (8).

an even number of cylinders (4) arranged in two 
parallel rows, that the cylinders of each pair of 

opposed rows are associated with a respective 
crankshaft (12) and that the two crankshafts (12) are 

connected together to rotate in synchronism. 
An engine as claimed in Claim 3 characterised 
in that the two cylinder blocks (2) are connected 

together with the interposition of two lateral 
crankcase structures (18) and one central crankcase 

structure (20), that each fastening member comprises 
two separate portions (24) and that each of the said 

main crankshaft bearings is supported by two fastening 
member portions (24) and a respective portion of a 

lateral crankcase structure (18) and the central 
crankcase structure (20), all the said portions being 

connected together at the crankshaft bearing.

together with the interposition of two lateral 
crankcase structures (18) and one central crankcase 

structure (20), and that each of the said main

portion of a lateral crankcase structure (18) and the 
central crankcase structure (20).  

 
An engine as claimed in any one of the

which remote from the associated crankshaft is 

substantially closed by an end wall in which one or 
more ports (42) are formed, that the free edge of the 

side wall of the cylinder liner (32) carries gear teeth 
(36) which engage directly or indirectly with gear 

teeth (40) on the crankshaft (12) and that one or more 
inlet apertures (48) and exhaust apertures are formed 

in that portion of the associated cylinder block which 
is adjacent to the end wall of the cylinder liner (32) 

whereby rotation of the crankshaft (12) results in 
rotation of the cylinder liner (32) about the axis of

liner (32) is connected to the associated cylinder head 
(2) on its axis of rotation by a connection (60) which
