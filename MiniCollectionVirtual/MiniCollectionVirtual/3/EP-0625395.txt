<ABSTRACT>
A boring tool for metallic materials has a holder (1) with a clamping slot into which a boring bit (2) is inserted and is clamped against a clamping-slot leg (8) by means of at least one screw bolt (3) which is provided with a head (21) and engages in a bore (15) in the boring bit (2) and in a bore (12) in the clamping-slot leg (8). The centre axes of the bore (12) in the clamping-slot leg and the bore (15) in the boring bit are offset. The peripheral edges, facing one another, of screw-bolt head (21) and boring-bit bore (15) are bevelled. Inserted in the holder (1) is a centring pin (11) which engages in a centring slot (18) in the side (17) of the boring bit (2) bearing against the base surface (9) of the clamping slot (4) in order to centre the boring bit (2) in the holder (1). In order to obtain more accurate centring, the nominal width of the centring slot (18) is greater than that of the section of the centring pin (11) engaging in it, while the direction and size of the offset of the centre axes mentioned are selected in such a way that, in the tightened state of the screw bolt, only the one side face (20) of the centring slot (18) bears in the centred position of the boring bit (2) against the one side of the centring pin (11).

Drilling tool for metallic materials, comprising a holder (1) 
having an axial clamping slot (4) in which a plate-shaped drilling 

blade (2) is inserted to bear against the base surface (9) of the 
clamping slot (4) and is clamped against a limb (8) of the 

clamping slot by means of a threaded pin (3), which is provided 
with a head (21) and which engages in a bore (15) in the drilling 

blade (2) and in a bore (12) in said limb (8) of the clamping 
slot, wherein the centre axis (13) of the bore (12) in said limb 

(8) of the clamping slot is offset relative to the center axis 
(24) of the bore (15) of the drilling blade (2) and at least one 

of two mutuallyfacing circumferential edges (16, 22) of the head 
(21) of the threades pin (3) and the bore (15) of the drilling 

blade is bevelled, and further comprising a centering pin (11; 
11a) which is inserted in the holder (1) and engages in a 

centering slot (18) in that side (17) of the drilling blade (2), 
which is contacting the base surface (9) of the clamping slot (4), 

so as to center the drilling blade (2) with respect to the 
rotational axis (6) of the holder (1), characterised in that the 

nominal width of the centering slot (18) is selected to be greater 
than that of the portion of the centering pin (11; 11a) engaging 

in the centering slot (18) and that the direction and amount of 
the offset of the central axes (13, 24) of the bore (15) of the 

drilling blade and bore (12) of the limb of the clamping slot are 
so selected that in the tightened state of the threaded pin (3) 

only one side face (20) of the centering slot (18) bears on one 
side of the centering pin (11; 11a) in the centered position of 

the drilling blade (2). 
Drilling tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
centering slot (18) extends in the direction of or obliquely 

relative to the rotational axis (6) of the holder (1) and the 
direction of the offset is so selected that the drilling blade (2) 

in the tightened state of the threaded pin (3) is pressed against 
the base surface (9) of the clamping slot (4) by a first clamping  

 
force component and, at said one side face (20) of the centering 

slot (18), against said one side of the centering pin (11; 11a) by a 
second clamping force component. 
Drilling tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the mutually adjacent side faces (20, 25) of the centering slot (18) 

and centering pin (11a) are flat. 
Drilling tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby that the centering pin (11) passes through the clamping slot 

and the centering slot (18) and engages at both ends in bores (10) 
of the limb (8) of the clamping slot.
