<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection element comprising an insulating housing (bridging piece) (30) having a U-shaped cross-section, the said housing having a central region (22) and two side branches (23, 24), as well as right-angled electrical contact elements having front contact regions (49) housed in openings in the central region of the housing (22), as well as regions (26) forming right-angled parts and rear contact regions (21), and a retention pin (31) in order to fix the connection element onto a flat support (28). It comprises a rear insulating body (40) surrounding the electrical contact elements on at least one zone located between the said front contact region (49, 38) and the said zone (26) forming a right-angled part, and in that the said retention pin (31) is firmly attached to an edge (45) of the said rear insulating body (40).

Connection element comprising an insulating 
bridging piece (30) having a U-shaped cross-section, the 

said bridging piece (30) having a central region (22) and 
two side branches (23,24), as well as right-angled 

electrical contact elements having front contact regions 
(49) housed in openings in the central region (22) of the 

bridging piece (30), as well as regions forming right-angled 
bends (26) and rear contact regions (21), and a 

retaining stud (31, 55) for fixing the connection element 
to a flat support (28), characterized in that it comprises 

a rear insulator body (40, 50) separate from the 
said central region (22) of the bridging piece (30), 

surrounding the electrical contact elements over at least 
a region lying between the said front contact region (49, 

38, 59, 68) and the said region forming a right-angled 
bend (26, 66), in that the said retaining stud (31, 55) 

is solidly attached to an edge (45, 54) of the said rear 
insulator body (40, 50) and in that the bridging piece 

(30) and the rear insulator body (40, 50) are assembled 
by snap-fastening (36, 37, 62). 
Connection element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the retaining stud is of the hot-deformable 

type. 
Connection element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the retaining stud is of the press-fittable 

type.  
 
Connection element according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the said edge (45) of the 

rear insulator body (40) is substantially in alignment 
with an external edge (46) of one branch (23) of the 

bridging piece (30). 
Connection element according to Claim 4, charactized 
in that the rear insulator body (40) comprises an 

extension (44) which includes the said edge (45). 
Connection element according to one of Claims 1 

to 3, characterized in that the edge (54) of the rear 
insulator body (50) is set back with respect to an 

external edge (46) of one branch (23) of the bridging 
piece (30). 
Connection assembly comprising a flat support and 
a connection element, characterized in that the said 

connection element is according to one of Claims 1 to 6. 
Connection assembly comprising a flat support and 
a connection element, characterized in that the said 

connection element is according to Claim 4 and in that 
the said external edge (46) of the said branch (23) of 

the bridging piece (30) bears on the flat support (28). 
Connection assembly comprising a flat support and 
a connection element, characterized in that the said 

connection element is according to Claim 6 and in that 
the bridging piece (30) is spaced away from an edge (63) 

of the flat support (48).
