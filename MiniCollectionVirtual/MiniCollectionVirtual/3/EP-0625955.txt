<ABSTRACT>
A method of winding a cable (2) on a rotating reel (1) by means of a guide (3) at an angle of lag (A) which is changed at both reel flanges (1a) through a position parallel with the flange to an opposite angle of lag when a cable turn comes into contact with the reel flange. To wind the cable turns more closely together at the reel flanges, the angle of lag (A) is changed into the position parallel with the reel flange before the cable turn comes into contact with the reel flange. A device for applying the method in a cable winding machine comprises detecting means (5) supported by the guide for detecting each reel flange (1a) and for changing the angle of lag of the cable to its parallel position before reversing means (4) detect the reel flange and reverse the direction of displacement of the guide (3) with respect to the reel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
winding a wire-like product, such as a cable, on a 
flanged reel in a winding machine, wherein 
the reel is supported rotatably about its 
axis by means of a support structure; the cable is passed on the reel to form 
superimposed layers of adjacent cable turns wound 
between reel flanges by means of a guide; the support structure and the guide are displaced 
with respect to each other with a pitch corresponding 
to the cable thickness per one cable turn, the cable being wound on the reel at an angle 
of lag with respect to adjacent cable turns, which 
angle is changed at each reel flange through a position 
parallel with the flange into an opposite angle 
of lag when a cable turn comes into contact with the 
reel flange. As used in this connection, the expression 
"wire-like product" refers to all kinds of long 
narrow continuous objects which can be wound on a 
reel, such as cables, conductors, and hoses, mainly 
products used in the manufacture of electric cables 
and data transmission conductors. For the sake of 
clarity, however, the invention will be described 
below with reference to a cable. When a cable is wound on a reel or drum, a 
guide is used so that the cable will be positioned 
between the flanges of the reel in superimposed layers 
each comprising a number of adjacent cable turns. In most prior art winding machines, e.g. U.S. 
Patent Specifications 4,143,834 (FURUKAWA), 4,150,801 
(KOBE STEEL), and 3,997,128 (FURUKAWA), the winding  
 
movements are effected by axially displacing the 
cable guide and the reel with respect to each other 
in the axial direction of the reel in such a way that 
when the reel accomplishes one revolution, the guide 
or the reel is displaced a distance equal to the 
thickness of the cable. The prior art winding 
machines are normally adjustable for handling reels 
having different drum diameters and different distances 
between the reel ends. The machines are also 
provided with a distributing machinery, by means of 
which the axial displacement between the guide and 
the reel for each revolution of the reel, i.e. the 
pitch at which the cable is wound on the reel, can be 
adjusted so that it always corresponds to the thickness 
of the cable to be wound. It is well-known in the cable manufacture that 
the best and densest winding result on the reel is 
obtained when the cable to be wound forms an oblique 
angle of lag with respect to the axis of the reel 
during the winding. It is also well-known that it is
