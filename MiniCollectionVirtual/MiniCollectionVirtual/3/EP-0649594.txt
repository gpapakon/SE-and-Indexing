<ABSTRACT>
A degradable, reusable, partially synthetic and partially non-synthetic 
bedding material for animals includes a plurality of flexible monofilaments formed 

from a blend of a thermoplastic polymer and starch. An effective amount of at least 
one transition metal salt may also be added to enhance ultraviolet and/or thermal 

degradation. The partially synthetic animal bedding has an appearance, texture and 
sound very similar to that of natural straw, but can be cleaned and reused repeatedly. 

The partially synthetic straw-like material is inert as far as digestibility and is 
degradable when exposed to sunlight and dry heat, and is biodegradable and 

compostable thereby providing for relatively easy disposal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bedding for animals. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a synthetic/non-synthetic bedding composition which, 
to the animal, has an appearance, texture and sound very similar to that of natural 
straw, but which can be cleaned and reused repeatedly. The partially synthetic straw-like 
material is inert as far as digestibility and is degradable when exposed to sunlight 
and/or dry heat. It is also biodegradable and compostable. This straw-like partially 
synthetic material also has improved physical characteristics as compared to other 
wholly synthetic bedding materials. Traditionally, natural materials such as straw, saw dust, rice hulls, and grass 
have been used for bedding materials in animal stalls and like places where animals 
typically rest. Generally, these natural materials are readily available and can be 
relatively inexpensive. However, daily disposal and replacement of these natural 
materials are generally required In order to keep the stalls and the like at least 
somewhat sanitary. That is, because of soiling and saturation due to animal urine and 
feces, at least partial, and sometimes total, replacement of these natural bedding 
materials is necessary on a daily basis. Inasmuch as each stall may require up to 
about 100 pounds of new bedding each day, the replacement and disposal of the 
soiled materials can become a problem for the user. Also, these natural materials are 
not reusable. It is also known that natural materials such as straw and the like may 
generate and stir up dust and other microscopic debris when the animals trample on 
the straw. This dust and debris fills the air in the stalls which the animals breathe and 
may result in health problems for the animals. Accordingly, in order to overcome these problems, substitutes for this 
natural bedding have been produced. For example, synthetic materials such as mats 
and cast floors have been introduced. However, some of these bedding systems tend  
 
to be easily destroyed by the animal's hoofs and tend to accumulate animal waste on 
their underside, causing still another disposal problem. Thus, still other artificial bedding materials have been introduced. For 
example, Tucci U.S. Pat. No. 4,038,944 discloses an artificial, wholly synthetic 
bedding material for animals which is reusable and is used to facilitate the removal 
of animal excretory waste. The bedding material comprises a plurality of rigid, 
elongated pieces of a nonflammable, nontoxic, hydrophobic,
