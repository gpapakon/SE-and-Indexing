<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerant circulating system that uses a highly polar 
refrigerant, as typified by a 

hydrofluorocarbon-based one, and a refrigerating oil that has low 
solubility with liquid 

refrigerant on the condensation side. The oil has a greater or smaller 
specific gravity than the 

liquid refrigerant. This can provide a high electrical insulation and 
moisture resistance, 

good oil return to the compressor (1), and high reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigerant circulating
system which uses a refrigerant which essentially contains
hydrofluorocarbon or third generation refrigerants.An example of a conventional refrigerant circulating
system is as shown in Fig. 14.As indicated by the publication "Tribologist)" Vol.
35, No. 9 (1990) pp. 621 to 626, in forming a refrigerating
machine using an HFC134a refrigerant containing
hydrofluorocarbon, PAG (polyether) or ester refrigerating
machine oil is employed, because the solubility of the
refrigerant and the refrigerating machine oil is one of the
important factors determining the performance of the
refrigerant circulating system. The conventional
refrigerant circulating system shown in Fig. 14 is a
refrigerating machine using an HFC134a refrigerant. In Fig.
14, reference numeral 1 designates a compressor for
compressing a refrigerant gas; 2, a condenser for condensing
a high pressure refrigerant gas discharged from the
compressor 1; 3, a throttle mechanism; 4, an evaporator; 5, a
4-way valve having a function of reversing the direction of
flow of the refrigerant; 8, an accumulator adapted to adjust
the quantity of refrigerant; and 6, a refrigerating machine 
oil kept in the compressor 1 to lubricate the slide parts of
the compressor 1 and to seal the compressing chamber thereof,
the oil being PAG 6a or ester refrigerating machine oil 6b.The behavior of the oil in the system will be
described. The refrigerant compressed by the compressor 1 is
supplied into the condenser 2. A larger part of the
lubricant 6a or 6b used for lubricating the compressor and
sealing the compressing chamber returns to the bottom of the
compressor; however, the lubricant 6a or 6b which corresponds
to about 0.5 to 3.0% of the refrigerant by weight is
discharged together with the refrigerant from the compressor.
The oil 6a or 6b thus discharged is soluble with the
refrigerant. Therefore, it flows smoothly through the
condenser 2, the capillary tube 3, and the evaporator 4 into
the accumulator 8, where it is dissolved in the excess of
liquid refrigerant 7a, thus returning through an oil
returning hole 82 into the compressor 1. Hence, the
lubricant 6 is kept in the compressor 1 at all times, thus
performing the lubrication satisfactorily.EP-A-0 485 979 discloses a refrigerant circulating system using
HFC 134a as the refrigerant and alkylbenzene oil as the refrigerating oil,
in an example of unsatisfactory prior art.Heretofore, as disclosed by Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication (Kokai) Hei-5-17789/(1992),
