<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricating oil composition, more 
especially to a lubricating oil composition having at least improved 
anti-wear properties when used in an internal combustion engine. In order to protect internal combustion engines from wear, 
engine lubricating oils have been provided with antiwear and anti-oxidant 
additives. The primary oil additive for the past 40 years for 
providing antiwear and antioxidant properties has been zinc dialkyldithiophosphate 
(ZDDP). For example, U.S. Patent 4,575,431 discloses 
a lubricating oil additive composition containing dihydrocarbyl 
dithiophosphates and a sulfur-free of hydrocarbyl dihydrogen phosphates 
and dihydrocarbyl hydrogen phosphates, said composition being 
at least 50% neutralized by a hydrocarbyl amine having 10 to 30 
carbons in said hydrocarbyl group. U.S. Patent 4,089,790 discloses an 
extreme-pressure lubricating oil containing (1) hydrated potassium 
borate, (2) an antiwear agent selected from (a) ZDDP, (b) an ester, an 
amide or an amine salt of a dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acid or (c) 
a zinc alkyl aryl sulfonate and (3) an oil-soluble organic sulfur 
compound. Oil additive packages containing ZDDP have environmental 
drawbacks. ZDDP adds to engine deposits which can lead to increased 
oil consumption and emissions. Moreover, ZDDP is not ash-free. 
Various ashless oil additive packages have been developed recently due 
to such environmental concerns. It would be desirable to have a lubricating oil additive 
which provides excellent antioxidant antiwear, fuel economy and  
 
environmentally beneficial (less fuel, i.e., less exhaust emissions) 
properties. This invention relates to alkoxylated amine salts of dihydrocarbyldithiophosphoric 
acids in lubricating oils to improve fuel 
economy wear protection and antioxidancy of lubricating oils used in 
an internal combustion engine. The lubricating oil composition 
comprises a major amount of a hydroisomerized wax basestock wherein 
the hydroisomerized wax basestock has a viscosity index of at least 
120, a pour point of -15°C or lower and a viscosity of from 2 to 
15 cSt at 100°C and from about 0.02 wt% to about 0.40 wt% based on 
basestock of an alkoxylated amine salt of a dihydrocarbyldithiophosphoric 
acid, said salt having the formula 
where R¹ and R² are each independently hydrocarbyl groups having from 
3 to 30 carbon atoms, R³ is a hydrocarbyl group having from 2 to 22 
carbon atoms, and x and y are each independently integers of from 1 to 
15 with the proviso that the
