<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flush toilets and,
more particularly, to flush toilets which employ
pressurized air to aid the flushing operation.U.S. Patent Nos. 3,986,526 and 3,720,962
provide examples of air-assisted flush toilets. These
toilets typically comprise a bowl portion and a gas-tight
base portion. Water is used to flush waste from
the bowl, and a gas such as air is used to pressurize
the base portion for conveying the waste through a
waste conduit (typically a 31.8mm (one and one-quarter
inch) or larger pipe) and into a waste tank located
below the toilet. The air assist allows the toilets
to perform the flushing operation with 1.1 to 2.2
litres (one to two quarts) of water rather than the
15.1 to 22.7 litres (four to six gallons) of water
required for conventional toilets. As a result, the
toilets may be installed on boats, trains, and other
vehicles which have limited space. As such vehicles
are further downsized or otherwise modified in a
manner which restricts the space for such amenities,
improvements which remove restrictions on the size or
location of the toilet and associated plumbing
(including water and waste storage facilities) are
welcome. Additionally, US Patent No. 4,156,297
provides a sewage treatment apparatus which renders
sewage substantially sterile after flushing the sewage
with water by a violent blending of air, water,
chemical and sewage in a macerating chamber.According to the invention there is provided a toilet
system as defined by any one of the amended claims. An embodiment of the invention is directed to an
air-assisted flush toilet which uses significantly
less water than known toilets and which has fewer
restrictions on the size and location of necessary
plumbing. More specifically, the water needed to
flush the toilet is reduced to 0.65 to 0.68 litres (22
to 23 ounces) of water, the pipe diameter of the
associated waste conduit is reduced to less than
31.8mm (one and one-quarter inch) and the waste tank
may be placed in any convenient location. In one
embodiment of the present invention, a toilet bowl has
a 
discharge opening for flowing waste material therefrom into
a gas-tight hopper. A waste valve is disposed between the
discharge opening and the hopper for controlling the flow of
waste material into the hopper. A first air valve
selectively allows air to flow into the hopper for
pressurizing the hopper and communicating the waste material
from the hopper to the inlet of a grinder. The outlet of
the grinder is coupled to a 25.4mm (one inch) waste conduit which

<CLAIMS>
A toilet system (10) comprising:

means (140) for receiving pressurized water;
a toilet bowl (19) in fluid communication with
the water receiving means, the toilet bowl having a

discharge opening (26) for flowing waste material
therefrom;
a water valve (140), coupled to the water
receiving means, for selectively allowing water to

flow into the toilet bowl through a water conduit
(148) ;
a hopper (30) in fluid communication with the
discharge opening for receiving waste material

therefrom;
a waste valve (34), disposed between the
discharge opening and the hopper, for selectively

allowing waste material to flow from the toilet bowl
into the hopper;
waste receiving means (64) including a waste
conduit (58) in fluid communication with the hopper

for receiving waste material from the hopper;
means (76) for receiving pressurized air;
a first air valve (104), disposed between the air
receiving means and the hopper, for selectively

allowing the pressurized air to flow into the hopper;
control means (68,72,84), coupled to the water
valve, to the waste valve, and to the first air valve

for selectively operating the water valve, the waste
valve, and the first air valve so that waste flows

from the toilet bowl to the waste receiving means; and
activation means (96) for initiating operation of
the control means;

   
characterised in that
 the toilet system (10)
further com
prises a second air valve (108), fluidly
connected between the air receiving means and the 

waste conduit, for selectively allowing the
pressurized air to flow into the waste conduit; and

   the control means further for selectively
operating the second air valve, the control means being coupled to said second air valve and

comprising:

water valve control means (80), coupled to the
water valve, for opening the water valve in response

to the activation means and for closing the water
valve after a selected water valve timing interval;
waste valve control means (38,112), coupled to
the waste valve, for opening the waste valve in

response to the activation means and for closing the
waste valve after a selected waste valve timing

interval;
first air valve control means (76), coupled to
the first air valve, for opening the first air valve

after the waste valve control means closes the waste
control valve and for closing the first air valve

after a selected first air valve timing interval; and
second air valve control means (76), coupled
to the second air valve, for opening the second air

valve after the first air valve control means closes
the first air valve and for closing the second air

valve after a second air valve timing interval; and
the toilet system (10) further comprises a check
valve (54) disposed in the waste conduit between the

hopper and the second air valve for preventing the
flow of waste material from the waste conduit toward

the hopper.
The toilet system (10) according to claim 1
further comprising a grinder (46) having an inlet (42)

in fluid communication with the hopper (30) and an
outlet (50) in fluid communication with the waste

conduit (58). 
The toilet system (10) according to claim 1
wherein the waste receiving means (64) includes a

waste tank (64) disposed above the toilet bowl (19).
A toilet system (10) according to claims 2 or 3
wherein the waste conduit (58) has a diameter of less

than 31.8mm (one and one-quarter inches), the waste
tank (64) is provided to receive waste material

flowing through the waste conduit (58) and the
activation means (96) is coupled to the control means

(68,72,84).
