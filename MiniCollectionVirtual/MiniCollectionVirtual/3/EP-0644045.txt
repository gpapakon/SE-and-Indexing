<ABSTRACT>
A biaxially oriented, laminated polyester film 
has a lamination structure with at least two layers. At 

least one of the outermost layers of the film is a thin 
laminated layer A having a thickness of not more than 3 µm. In 

the layer A, (a) internally formed particles (and optionally mono-dispersed 
particles) are present, (b) internally formed particles and specified 

agglomerated particles (and optionally mono-dispersed particles) are present, 
or (c) mono-dispersed particles are present at a very small 

content. When the polyester film is used as a base film for 
magnetic recording media, the abrasion resistance of the film 

surface at a high speed can be greatly increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxially oriented,
laminated polyester film particularly suitable as a base film
for video tapes.As a biaxially oriented polyester film used as a base film
for magnetic recording media, a film containing spherical silica
particles originating from colloidal silica is known and
described in, for example, JP-A-SHO 59-171623. Further, as a
biaxially oriented, laminated polyester film, a polyester film,
wherein a thin layer containing particles to form surface
protrusions is laminated on a base layer, is also known and
described in, for example, JP-A-HEI 2-77431.In such conventional polyester films, however, there is a
problem that a film surface, particularly, protrusions formed
on the film surface, is likely to be abraded by a contacting
roll or guide or an edge of an applicator, this being particularly so
nowadays with the recent increase in tape or film running
speed in FF and REW modes of a video tape recorder, in
calendering or otherwise during processing for making magnetic recording
media, in dubbing processes, or in processes for incorporating a tape
into a cassette. Further, there is a problem that the
signal/noise ratio (S/N) when the film is processed into a
video tape is not so good and it is difficult to obtain a
sufficiently high-quality image when the original video tape  
formed from the film is dubbed particularly at a high dubbing
speed which has been realized by high-speed magnetic field
transferring technology.It would be desirable to provide a biaxially oriented,
laminated polyester film whose surface is hardly abraded even in
a high-speed running in a video tape recorder or in a high-speed
process for processing the film as described above, and to
provide a biaxially oriented, laminated polyester film which is
suitable as a base film for video tapes wherein reduction of
image quality at the time of dubbing can be suppressed when the
film is formed as a video tape, that is, a good electromagnetic
conversion property can be obtained.A polyester film according to the present invention has a
laminate structure with at least two layers, at least one layer
of which laminate structure is biaxially oriented. At least one
outermost layer of the film is a thin laminated layer A having a
thickness of not less than 0.01 µm and not more than 3 µm. At
least the thin layer A contains (1) internally formed particles
(that is, non-incorporated particles)
are prepared by adding at least one
of a calcium compound, a magnesium compound, a manganese
compound and a
