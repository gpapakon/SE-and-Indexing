<ABSTRACT>
An image magnification control device for a camera. Control 
focal length required to maintain an image magnification 

constant is computed based upon the focus information 
detected by using a light having passed through a 

photographic lens. The device comprises a determining means 
for determining whether the focal length of the 

photographic lens comes out of a range wherein the set 
image magnification can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image magnification
control device for a camera
according to the preamble of claim 1.A desireable feature for a power zoom camera is
to be able to maintain a constant image magnification of
an object as the distance between the object and the
camera varies. For instance, when taking a series of
continuous photographs of, for instance, a baseball
player running to catch a ball, the photographer may
wish that the baseball player occupies the same area of
the film frame as the player moves. This can be
accomplished by varying the focal length of the lens when the 
player moves. Unfortunately, an individual can not
change the magnification value (by changing the focal
length of the lens) fast enough and accurately enough to
achieve the desired result.Over the years camera manufacturers have developed
power zoom lenses for lens shutter cameras. This enables
a photographer to quickly and smoothly change the focal
length of the camera lens. Lens shutter cameras
typically employ a triangulation technique to
determine the distance of an object to be photographed
from the camera. In the triangulation technique,
infrared or ultrasonic rays are
emitted by the camera. They are reflected from the
object to be photographed and returned to the camera.
By utilizing the triangulation technique, the distance,
"a" of the object can be determined.The magnification value of a lens shutter camera
is determined by the equation m=f/a, where "m" equals
the magnification value, "f" equals the focal length of
the lens and "a" equals the distance of the object from
the camera. If a constant image size is to be
maintained, the lens shutter camera must merely
determine the distance of the object from the camera
and change the focal length of the lens according to
the above equation, so that the magnification value 
"m", remains constant. This is easily accomplished
with a power zoom. auto-focus, lens shutter camera.Many individuals prefer using interchangeable lens
cameras, such as SLR cameras, because a plurality of
different lenses can be easily attached to the camera
body. It would be desirable to enable an
interchangeable lens camera to maintain
a constant image size as the object to be
photographed moves relative to the camera. However,
constant image magnification techniques that are
applicable to lens shutter cameras are not applicable
to interchangeable lens cameras.In an interchangeable lens camera, triangulation
techniques are generally not used for focusing
purposes because of inherent
