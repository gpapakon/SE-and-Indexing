<ABSTRACT>
The device includes a swift (24) that is formed by a 
set of axial rods (21) that partially and variably protrude 

from respective slots (130) formed on the drum (13) of the 
feeder (10) by virtue of the compound motion applied to the 

swift by a bush (26) that is associated with the drive 
shaft (12). The bush (26) is supported by a recessed 

coaxial portion (121) of the drive shaft (12) to which it 
is pivoted by means of a diametrical pin (27), and has a 

cylindrical and eccentric outer surface and an internal 
surface that is profiled so as to form two portions of 

truncated-cone surfaces. The bush (26) can thus oscillate 
about the pin (27) and be arranged at an angle with respect 

to the drive shaft (12). An actuation means (31) is 
provided to vary the inclination of the bush (26) when the 

bush is rotated with respect to the means (31), which is 
kept fixed by a pushbutton stop device (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
separating reserve turns of thread for devices that feed
weft to weaving looms, particularly shuttle-less gripper,
projectile and fluid-jet looms.As is known, weft feeders for looms of the specified
type, or more generally for textile machines, are devices
provided with a fixed drum; multiple turns of thread to be
fed to the loom are wound at the base of said drum by means
of a suitable flywheel which has a windmilling arm rigidly
coupled to a drive shaft of the device. These turns
constitute a reserve of thread which must be proportionate
to the beat rate of the loom to be fed and are unwound from
the opposite end -- briefly termed dome -- of the drum; the
turns that are gradually removed are replaced by an
advancement system which moves said turns from the base to
the dome of the drum, keeping them mutually spaced by a
given pitch that determines the number of turns wound, and
thus the amount of the thread reserve.The known and now universally adopted advancement
system uses a swift which is formed by a set of
rotationally rigidly coupled axial rods which partially and
variably protrude from respective axial slots, provided on
the drum, by virtue of a compound motion which is applied
to the swift by the drive shaft of the feeder by means of a
tilted bush which is fitted on an eccentric portion of said
drive shaft. The motion applied to the swift by said bush
and by the eccentric portion of the shaft is substantially
the result of a sinusoidal undulatory component and of an 
oscillatory component on the axial plane and makes the
turns of thread advance axially along the drum; the
direction of said advancement depends on the direction of
the rotation of the drive shaft. Since the turns must
always advance from the base towards the dome of the drum,
if the direction of the rotation of the drive shaft is
changed -- for example to adapt the device to threads with
left-handed or right-handed twisting -- the bush must be
correspondingly replaced with another one which is mirror-symmetrical,
so as to reverse the inclination of the swift
with respect to the drum.This operation entails disassembling the swift from
the drive shaft, extracting the bush of one kind, mounting
the bush of the other kind, and reassembling the swift.In an attempt to obviate this troublesome series of
operations that require long downtimes of the feeder,
special bushes have been provided which are more simply
rotated about their axis and are fixed, by means of
transverse locking screws, in

Device for separating the reserve turns of thread
for devices that feed weft to weaving looms and the like,

comprising a swift (24) that is formed by a set of axial
rods (21) that partially and variably protrude from

respective slots (130) formed on the drum (13) of the feeder
(10) by virtue of the compound motion applied to the swift

by a bush (26) that is associated with the drive shaft (12) of
said feeder, the bush (26) being supported by a recessed

coaxial portion (121) of the drive shaft (12) and having a
cylindrical and eccentric outer surface (260), the bush (26)

being able to oscillate and be arranged at an angle with
respect to the drive shaft (12), an active cam profile (28)

being formed on the front part of the bush (26),
the device being characterized in that the bush

(26) is pivoted to the drive shaft (12) by means of a
diametrical pin (27); in that said bush (26) has an internal

surface that is profiled so as to form two portions of
truncated-cone surfaces (261-262) that lie mutually opposite

at the respective smaller diameter, which is substantially
equal to the diameter of the recessed coaxial portion (121)

of the drive shaft, so that the bush (26) can oscillate
about said pin (27) and be arranged at an angle with respect

to the drive shaft (12); and in that said active cam profile
(28) is engaged by two straddling movement pawls (29-30)

which are supported by a disk (31) rigidly coupled to the shaft
(12) and which are suitable

to vary the inclination of the bush (26) when said bush is
rotated with respect to said disk (31) while said disk is 

kept fixed in rotation by means of a pushbutton stop device
(34).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the diametrical pin (27) for pivoting the bush (26) is

arranged at the section of the bush that has the smallest
internal diameter.
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the active cam profile (28) provided on the front part

of the bush (26) is delimited by recessed circular arcs,
respectively an inner one (280) and an outer one (281), and

in that the inner arc (280) is limited by shoulders (282-283).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
said inner and outer recessed circular arcs (280-281) both

cover 180Â°.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the disk (31) provided with

the movement pawls (29-30) is keyed, so that it can rotate
freely, on a second recessed portion (122) of the drive

shaft (12) and is rigidly coupled to said drive shaft by an
actuation disk (32) which is provided with an elastic

coupling means (33) which also acts as position-marking
element for the mutual angular movements of the disk (31)

and of the actuation disk (22).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that
the actuation disk (32) is keyed on the second recessed

portion (122) of the drive shaft (12) by means of a
diametrical pin (320).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that

and which is associated with the actuation disk
(32), comprises a ball (330) actuated by a spring (331) so

which are provided on the disk (31) and are arranged so as

to form a ring.
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that
each hollow (310) is matched by a position for the
