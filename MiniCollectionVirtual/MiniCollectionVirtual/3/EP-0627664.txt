<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the repair of defects 
in phase-shifting masks. Optical projection exposure tools are now widely used in optical 
lithography in the production of integrated circuits. The exposure tools 
generally comprise an electromagnetic light source, a mask and a lens. 
The tool functions to project the image of the mask onto the surface of a 
photoresist film disposed on a wafer. Because of the continuing demands 
for higher circuit density in integrated circuits, there is a continuing 
desire to improve resolution of optical lithography. One method of 
improving the resolution involves the use of phase-shifting masks. The 
phase-shifting mask generally comprises a plurality of individual 
transparent phase-shifting layers disposed in a pattern on a transparent 
substrate. Optionally, the phase-shifting mask can also be provided with 
opaque areas such as a chrome pattern. Light which is focused on the 
mask will either be reflected by the opaque chrome pattern or be 
transmitted through the transparent portion of the mask. The 
phase-shifting layer causes the transmitted light to be 180Â° out of phase 
with the light which is only transmitted through the transparent 
substrate, i.e. the non-phase-shifted light, resulting in coherent 
interaction of the combined phase-shifted and non-phase-shifted 
transmitted light with improved resolution. Phase shifting masks are 
generally fabricated using standard photolithography techniques. For 
example, Levenson, et al. in his article "Improving Resolution in 
Photolithography with Phase - Shifting Mask" IEEE Transaction on Electron 
Devices Vol. 29, No. 12 (12/82), discloses fabrication of a 
phase-shifting mask using photolithography with polymethacrylate as the 
mask material. However, occasionally during the fabrication of the phase-shifting 
mask, void-type defects occur in the phase-shifting layer. These defects 
disrupt the coherent interaction of the transmitted light and can in some 
cases result in loss of resolution of the projected image on the 
photoresist film. Therefore, the object of the invention is to provide a 
method for repairing defects in the phase shifting layer of 
phase-shifting masks.  This is achieved by the invention claimed in claim 1. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a phase-shifting mask; Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a second phase-shifting mask; 
and Fig. 3 is
