<ABSTRACT>
A pin-type double acting synchronizer clutch (10) is disclosed 
with improved pre-energizer spring assemblies (46 or 52). The spring 

assemblies each include at least two leaf springs 48 or 54 sandwiched 
between split pin members (44). Retainers (50 or 55) at opposite ends of 

the leafs prevent escape of the leafs from between the split pin members. 
In one embodiment the retainers (50) are formed separate of the leafs and 

in another embodiment the retainers (55) are integrally formed with the leafs 
(54) by an extension (54d,54e,54f) of one end of each leaf.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a double acting synchronizer clutch assembly for a 
transmission. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved pre-energizer 
spring arrangement for such a synchronizer. Pin-type synchronizers of the general type disclosed herein are 
well known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent 
Numbers 2,667,955; 3,910,390; 4,018,319; 4,478,321 and 4,989,706. Pin-type synchronizers generally include an axially slidable 
clutch collar that is mounted on a splined portion of a shaft on which a pair 
of axially spaced gears are rotatably mounted. The clutch collar is provided 
with jaw clutch teeth which are adapted to engage complimentary jaw 
clutch teeth formed on the rotatable gears to positive clutch a selected one 
of the gears to the shaft. The clutch collar is formed with a radially 
extending flange having two sets of circumferentially spaced openings 
extending axially therethrough and parallel to the rotational axis of the shaft. 
Disposed through one set of the openings are pins which are rigidly fixed at 
their ends to friction rings that are adapted to cooperate with friction 
surfaces affixed to the aforementioned gears. The pins, usually called 
blocker pins, have reduced central portions that define radially outwardly 
extending shoulders adapted to cooperate with peripheral edges of the 
openings for blocking axial movement of the flange relative to the friction 
rings during nonsynchronous rotation of the shaft and a selected one of the 
gears. Disposed through the other set of openings, which are alternately 
spaced between the blocker pin openings, are longitudinally split pin 
assemblies which are freely received at their ends in oblong recesses formed 
in mutually facing surfaces of the friction rings. Each split pin assembly 
includes a pair of members forming a centrally located annular groove which 
is biased into engagement with the peripheries of the associated split pin  
 
opening by springs sandwiched between the members. As is well known, 
the split pin assemblies cause one of the friction rings to engage a friction 
surface of a selected one of the gears in response to initial axial movement 
of the flange, thereby effecting limited relative rotation of the flange and 
friction rings during the aforementioned nonsynchronous condition for 
assuring blocking engagement by the blocker pins. While the above mentioned synchronizer assemblies have been 
widely used for many years, problems have been associated with the springs 
sand

<CLAIMS>
A double acting synchronizer clutch (22) including two axially movable friction 
rings (36,38) rigidly connected together about a rotational axis (12a) in axially spaced 

relation on opposite sides of an axially movable, radially extending flange (32); a plurality 
of circumferentially spaced apart openings (32c) extending axially through the flange (32); 

a split pin assembly (42) including a pair of members (44) and a spring assembly (46) 
extending axially through each opening (32c) and between the friction rings (36,38) for 

effecting axial movement of the friction rings (36,38) in response to initial axial movement 
of the flange (32) from a neutral position, each pair of members (44) defining a generally 

cylindrical outer surface with a radially outwardly open annular detent groove (44a) for 
receiving a peripheral surface of one of the openings (32c), the members of each pair of 

members (44) each having first and second ends (44c,44d) respectively disposed to abut 
one of the friction rings (36,38); each spring assembly (46) including at least first and 

second leaf spring (48) each having a bowed length in the axial direction of the opening 
(32c) and a width corresponding to a transverse direction, the bow of the first leaf spring 

being opposite the bow of the second leaf spring, the leaf springs (48) sandwiched between 
and unaffixed to mutually facing surfaces (45) of each pair of members (44), the leaf 

springs (48) each having first and second end portions (48c,48b) with the first and second 
end portions (48c,48b) of the first and second leaf springs (48) respectively in contact with 

each other and with the second and first end portions (48b,48c) of the first and second leaf 
springs (48) respectively in contact with each other, characterized by: 


each leaf spring first end portion (48c) axially overlapping the associated second 
end portion (48b); and 
retainer means (50) disposed at the leaf spring first and second end portions 
(48c,48b) of each spring assembly (48), each retainer means (50) allowing the leaf spring 

ends (48c,48b) in contact with each other to move axially relative to each other and 
including means (50a,50b) reacting roll forces tending to roll the springs (48) relative to 

each other. 
The clutch assembly of Claim 1, wherein mutually, axially facing 
surfaces (36b,38b) of the friction rings (36,38) each include a plurality of blind, 

oblong recesses (37,39) equal in number and circumferential spacing to the 
circumferentially spaced apart openings (32c) in the flange (32) and 

circumferentially positioned to receive the ends (44c,44d) of the members (44) 

of the split pin assemblies (42), each oblong recess (37,39) being elongated in 
the circumferential direction and of sufficient diameter in a radial direction 

relative to the rotational axis (12a) to allow sliding movement of the ends of the 
members (44) in the circumferential direction. 
The clutch of Claims 1 or 2, wherein the retainer means (50) 
further includes spaced apart tabs (50c,50d) rigidly secured together and 

embracing the width of at least the second end portion (48b) for limiting 
widthwise movement of the leaf springs relative to each other in the transverse 

direction. 
The clutch of Claims 2 or 3, wherein each retainer means (50) 
includes a rigid bracket (50) having four spaced apart side walls 

(50a,50b,50c,50d) defining a rectangular opening receiving the first and second 
end portions (48c,48b) with two of the spaced apart side walls (50c,50d) in the 

transverse direction defining the tabs and two of the spaced apart side walls 
(50a,50b) extending between the tabs reacting the roll forces. 
The clutch of Claims 1 or 2, wherein each first end portion (54b) is a 
U-shaped portion receiving the second end portion (54c) 

associated therewith, each U-shaped portion formed by reverse bending 
an axial extension of the first portion (54b) and thereby defining means reacting 

the roll forces tending to roll the springs relative to each other. 
The clutch of Claim 5, wherein opposite edges defining the width 
of one of the end portions (54b) of each first and second end portions 

(54b,54c) in contact with each other includes the tabs (54e,54f) extending  
 

therefrom at substantially right angles and embracing the width of the other end 
portion (54c).
