<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the linear demodulation of a receive signal, a plurality of support values @i-(n+1¦n) of an impulse response of a frequency-selective channel which transmits the receive signal are determined according to the LMS principle. The different support values are tracked recursively with different step widths vi and with the aid of hypothetical, finally estimated or known data @lphan:
