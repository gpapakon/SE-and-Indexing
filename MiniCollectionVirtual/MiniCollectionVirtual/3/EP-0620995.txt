<ABSTRACT>
A multi-directional rocking crib, having a base (10) which 
pivots about a pivot (22), a first member (32) operatively 

associated with the pivot and a second member (34, 34a) having at 
least one arm with a weight (44, 44a) at the end thereof extending 

transversely to and connected with the first member, a rotator to 
rotate the arm with the weight at the end thereof for tilting of 

the base or movement of the base as the first member rotates 
relative to the pivot to provide an undulating movement of the edge 

of each side of the base as the pivot rotates to move the base into 
and out of the different planes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rocking crib and, more 
particularly, the invention is concerned with a multi-directional 
rocking crib which can have its sides moved in an 
undulating motion. There have been many external source stimulants used to 
induce sleep to a newborn infant. Heretofore, a rocking action 
has been imparted to a crib or bed so that usually one side is 
uniformly raised and the other side is uniformly lowered and, 
in effect, one long side is raised or lowered about a center 
pivot or about a long axis through the longitudinal center of 
the crib. Specifically, taking a rectangular crib, for example, 
with two length or long sides and two width or short sides 
orthogonally connected to the long sides, when a rocking action 
is imparted to the crib, one of the length or long sides is 
raised and the other substantially parallel length side is 
lowered, while the width sides form an inclination between the 
length sides with one end of each width side being raised and 
the other end lowered, and the intermediate portions of the 
width or short sides being moved to a lower position in a 
uniformly decreasing position. While the conventional crib could be rocked to see-saw about 
a central transverse axis perpendicular to the two long sides, 
such rocking is usually not done.  An object of the present invention is to achieve a multi-directional 
rocking of a crib so that rocking does not take 
place solely about a long axis or, for that matter, solely along 
a short axis orthogonal to the long axis or any diagonal axis, 
and to simulate a rocking action which takes place in the 
mother's womb, particularly because the unborn infant or foetus 
is, in effect, tethered to the mother by the mother's umbilical 
cord and, more specifically, the foetus should be considered to 
be suspended in an amniotic sac and susceptible to motion due 
to movement of the mother and external forces. With the present invention, it is proposed to impart an 
external stimulant or environment to a newborn infant which 
simulates the last three months of its gestation. The external 
source stimulant induces the baby to go to sleep. The stimulant 
consists of the environment that replicates the mother's womb 
environment. The environment consists of the external stimulus 
a baby can feel or be subjected to while it is in the mother's 
womb. It is basically proven that, by the sixth month of 
gestation, a baby has developed most of its senses. While the 
baby is sleeping in the mother's womb, and moves from a wake

with the pivoting means for movement of the base portion about the 

pivot. 
The crib as claimed in claim 6, characterized by a

preventing it from being lowered or raised above the amount the one 
width side is lowered or raised.
