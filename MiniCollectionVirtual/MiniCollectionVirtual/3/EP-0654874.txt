<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser with a nonlinear crystal (23, 
47, 75, 111) that generates second harmonic light at a 

frequency which is twice the fundamental frequency of the 
laser. The laser is configured in a vertical-cavity, 

surface-emitting structure or an edge-emitting structure. 
A nonlinear crystal is attached to a semiconductor 

optical amplifier (15, 31, 67, 95) by fusing with wafer 
bonding techniques or by epitaxially growing the 

nonlinear crystal on the amplifier. The amplifier and 
the nonlinear crystal are located inside a laser cavity 

(27, 87) that is defined between a pair of reflectors 
(11, 25; 43, 49; 63, 81; 117, 119). One of the 

reflectors (25, 49, 81, 119) is located adjacent the 
nonlinear crystal and is highly reflective at the 

fundamental frequency but transmissive at twice the 
fundamental frequency. Light is generated at the 

fundamental frequency, doubled in frequency as it passes 
back and forth through the nonlinear crystal, and emitted 

through the reflector adjacent the nonlinear crystal. An 
optional region (49, 51, 91, 121) between the amplifier 

and the nonlinear crystal prevents reflections at the 
fundamental frequency or prevents light at twice the 

fundamental frequency from propagating from the nonlinear 
crystal into the amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to lasers and more particularly to a 
semiconductor laser that generates second harmonic light by means of a nonlinear 
crystal attached to a semiconductor optical amplifier in the laser cavity. There has been a need for an inexpensive, compact source of blue light for 
use in applications as diverse as flat displays for computers and entertainment 
systems, medical devices, analytical instruments, data storage, and optical 
communications. Blue light has a relatively short wavelength (about 4,700 
Ångstroms) and has been more difficult to generate than longer-wavelength light 
such as green light (about 5,200 Å), red light (about 6,500 Å), or infrared, which 
extends from about 7,000 Å to over 100,000 Å. Some kinds of light-emitting diodes ("LEDs") are capable of emitting blue 
light. However, LEDs can only emit light over a relatively broad spectrum and 
therefore are not suitable for applications that require a single wavelength or a 
narrow range of wavelengths. In addition, the output power of LEDs is too low 
for many applications. Lasers can generate light at a single wavelength, but most 
lasers, especially semiconductor lasers, have not been able to generate light with a 
wavelength as short as that of blue light. For example, lasers fabricated of group 
III-V semiconductor compounds (usually compounds of gallium, indium or 
aluminum with arsenic or phosphorus such as AlGaAs or AlGaInP) do not produce 
significant energy--at room temperature--at wavelengths shorter than about 5,500 
Å. Other semiconductor light sources are very weak (e.g. silicon carbide), have a  
 
very short lifetime (e.g. polymers) or are too soft to work with easily and are not 
sufficiently reliable (e.g. group II-VI compounds). A semiconductor laser that can produce blue light was first reported by 
Hasse et al. in Applied Physics Letters, vol. 59, page 1272 (1991). This device is 
fabricated of a zinc-cadmium-sulfur-selenium compound and works at an extremely 
low temperature of 77°K (-196°C), not at room temperature. Continuous wave 
("CW") devices that work at room temperature with reasonable lifetimes have not 
been reported. Another approach is to direct the output of a laser that generates infrared 
light into a nonlinear device that produces a second harmonic of the infrared light. 
The second harmonic is twice the frequency, and hence half the wavelength, of the 
fundamental. For example, infrared light with a fundamental wavelength of 9,400 
Å has a second harmonic with a
