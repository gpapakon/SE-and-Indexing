<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and materials
for changing the tone of black-and-white images formed
utilizing dye forming colored couplers.In the past, toners containing selenium and
sulfide have been used on black-and-white prints to
change the silver image hue to one that better conveys
the mood or atmosphere of the subject. Proper disposal
of these chemicals has always been required, even though
environmental concerns were not as great as they are
today. It is anticipated that further restriction will
limit the use of these toners in the future. While still
desirable, the traditional method of, toning black-and-white
prints will not be compatible with the new
chromogenic black-and-white paper which uses color
emulsions and couplers to create a neutral image with
dyes rather than with silver as in traditional black-and-white
photography. Because chromogenic black-and-white
papers use dyes instead of silver, a dye bleach is
necessary to change the hue.Dye bleaching is used on EKTACHROME slides;
however, color paper is not suitable for color adjustment
by after treatment. Eastman Kodak publication E-70
states: "At this time there are no dye bleaches we can
recommend for KODAK EKTACOLOR and EKTACHROME papers. The
formulas previously published for use with earlier KODAK
EKTACOLOR papers do not work satisfactorily with KODAK
EKTACOLOR PLUS and Professional papers." The prior art
has references to dye bleaching, such as Rubenstein U.S.
Patent 2,467,359 and Harder U.S. Patent 4,990,430. There remains a need for a method of changing
the tone or hue of black-and-white papers formed with
color dyes formed from dye forming couplers. In the
past, silver containing black-and-white images have been
capable of being adjusted by various materials applied to
the papers after image formation. There is a desire by
photographers to also be able to do this with neutral
black and white images formed utilizing color dyes.It is an object of the present invention to
allow toning of black-and-white images formed utilizing
colored dye forming couplers.Another object of the invention is to allow
toning of black-and-white images produced by colored dyes
in a manner similar to that utilized in toning of black-and-white
images formed from silver.These and other objects of the invention are
generally accomplished by providing a method of toning a
black-and-white image formed with color couplers
comprising providing a developed print, applying a hue
changing material to said print wherein the hue of at
least one dye in said print

formed with color couplers comprising providing a

developed print, and applying a hue changing material to
said print wherein the hue of at least one dye in said

print is changed.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said hue
changing material bleaches at least one dye.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said hue
changing material comprises at least one acid.

comprises hydrochloric acid.
The method of Claim 3 wherein said acid
comprises sulfuric acid.

is formed.
The method of Claim 1 wherein a brown tone
is formed.
The method of Claim 3 wherein said hue
changing material further comprises stannous chloride.
