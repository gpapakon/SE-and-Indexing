<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a biological bandage (10), comprising an envelope (12) enclosing cells (16) which secrete biologically active cellular products (17) such as growth factors, which promote the healing of wounds. The envelope (12) is further comprised of a permeable bottom membrane (15) through which the cellular product (17) diffuses, and an impermeable top membrane (14). Preferably the bandage (10) has a separator (30) interposed betwen the two membranes. This invention also relates to a method for genetically engineering the cells (16), and a method for treating wounds. The bandage (10) provides a continous, uniform source of fresh, pure cellular product (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
 BANDAGE FOR CONTINUOUS APPLICATION OF BIOLOGICALSField of the InventingThis invention relates to a bandage which continuously provides curative cell products to a wound. More particularly, the invention relates to a bandage having a chamber for containing cells and cell culture media, said chambers having a cell product permeable membrane, to genetically engineered cells useful in said bandage and to a method for producing such cells.Background of the Invention The treatment of wounds in mammals, both animals and humans, has historically involved a simple passive bandage which provides physical protection and, to some extent, reduces infection. The treatment has progressed from this simple bandage to more active treatments. In serious wounds, particularly burns, skin grafting and skin sheets have been applied. Eventually the skin cells "take" and fill in the wound. Attempts have been made to expedite healing by introduction of various growth factors directly into the wound, see Brown 6.L., Curtsinger L., Jurkiewicz M.J., Nahi F. , Schultz G. , (1991) "Stimulation of Healing of Wounds by Epidermal Growth Factor," Plast. Reconstr. Surg. , Vol. 88, pp. 189-194; Brown G.L., Nanney L.B., Griffen J., Cramer A.B., Yancey J.M. , Curtsinger L. , Holtzin L. , Schultz G., Jurkiewicz M.J. , and Lynch J.B. (1989) "Enhancement of Wound Healing by Topical Treatment with Epidermal Growth Factor," New England J. Med. , Vol. 321, pp. 76-79; ten Dijke P., Iwata K.K., "Growth Factors for Wound Healing" (1989) Biotechnology, Vol. 7, pp. 793-798; Pierce G.F., Mustoe T.A. , Altrock B.W. Deuel T.F., Thomason A., (1991) , "The Role of Platelet Derived Growth Factor in Wound Healing Cellular Biochemistry," Vol. 45, pp. 319-316; and, "EGF and PDGF-Alpha in Wound Healing and Repair," Schultz, Rotatori, and Clark, J. of Cellular Biochemistry, Volume 45, pp. 346-352 (1991) . Growth factors encourage the proliferation and/or differention of the cells in the tissue within and around the wound. Several attempts have been made to introduce these growth factors into the wound by means of a topical gel or the like, applied over the surface of the wound. However, such growth factor containing gels have several drawbacks. The amount of 

growth factor contained in these gels is fixed. Over time, the enzymes produced from the patient's own tissue may degrade the gel and/or the growth factor. Further, the isolation and purification of the growth factor may decrease its biological activity.Attempts have been made to drip the growth factor
