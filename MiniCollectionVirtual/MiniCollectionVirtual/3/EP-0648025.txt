<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention provides a solution for adapting the centre tap of the equalizer in order to avoid false pull-in-states. For this purpose, an MMLE (Maximum/Minimum Level Error) algorithm is provided with a one-dimensional error template for the correct adjustment of the centre cap of the equalizer, in such a manner that, in order to determine the error signals of in-phase and quadrature component, the equalized signal before the decision circuit and the decided value are subtracted from one another and the error signals are applied to the MMLE algorithm for error weighting. This algorithm contains in its error template components which detect a level which is too low and components which respond to levels which are too high. From the errors, signals are formed by either switching the error through or gating it out in dependence on the equalized signal and the adaptation is carried out with the aid of these signals.

A method of channel equalisation and compensation for cross-polarisation
interference, XPI, in transmission systems with multi-stage quadrature amplitude

modulation, QAM, or pulse amplitude modulation, PAM, using adaptive
transversal filters with following decision circuits and correlators for deriving the

coefficients for adjusting the equaliser, 
characterized by
 a maximum/minimum
level error algorithm, MMLE algorithm, with a one-dimensional error template

for correct adjustment of the centre tap of the equaliser such that, in order to
determine the error signals (e
I
, e
Q
) of the in-phase and quadrature components,
the equalised signal (Y
I
, Y
Q
) preceding the decision circuit and the decision value
(창
I
, 창
Q
) are subtracted from one another and the error signals (e
I
, e
Q
) and the
equalised signal (Y
I
, Y
Q
) are applied to the MMLE algorithm for the error
evaluation, which algorithm includes in its error template components which

recognise a level of the equalised signal (Y
I
, Y
Q
) which is too low as well as
components which react to a level of the equalised signal (Y
I
, Y
Q
) which are too
high and in that signals (e
I
', e
Q
') are formed from the error signals (e
I
, e
Q
) in
which the errors are either switched through or gated out, in dependence on the

equalised signal (Y
I
, Y
Q
) and the adaptation is effected with the aid of these
signals, wherein the errors are evaluated when the value of the equalised signal

y(n) is smaller than a value a
min
 or greater than a value a
max
 which values lie in
the template in the central and edge regions respectively.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the gating out is effected in
a manner such that the error is set to zero.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 an alternating sequence -
1/+1/-1/+1 is applied as the sign for the error entering the adaptation.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the signals (e
I
',
e
Q
') formed from the errors (e
I
, e
Q
) and a signal picked off from the transmission
path as a reference signal are applied to a correlator for the adaptation. 
A method according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the reference signal consists
of the signal (x
I
, x
Q
) preceding the equaliser, the signal (Y
I

decision circuit or the decision signal (창
I
, 창

A method according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 only the sign is used for
deriving the correlation contribution of at least one of the signals.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the MMLE
algorithm is utilised only during the running-in phase of the system and a switch

is made in the locked-in state to another correlation, e.g. a zero-forcing criterion.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the adjustment
(C

) of the centre tap of the equaliser is implemented as the main tap in the
equaliser.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the adjustment
of the centre tap of the equaliser is implemented as automatic regulation of the

gain, AGC = automatic gain control, following the equaliser and the centre tap is
set to a fixed value different from zero.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the adjustment
of the centre tap of the equaliser is implemented as automatic regulation of the

gain, AGC = automatic gain control, preceding the equaliser and the centre tap is
