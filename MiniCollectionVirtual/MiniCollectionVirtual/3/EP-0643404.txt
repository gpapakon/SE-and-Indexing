<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a variable inductance element as claimed in the 
preamble of claim 1. Such kind of element is already known from WO-A-87 07074 comprising: 
an electrically insulating substrate having opposed first and second surfaces; 
an electrical conductor disposed in a first spiral on the first surface 
of the substrate; an electrically insulating film disposed on the first surface 
and the first spiral; a second electrical conductor disposed in a second 
spiral on the electrically insulating film and inductively coupled to the first 
spiral; and means for producing and controlling an electrical current flow 
through one of said spirals. It is an object of the present invention to provide another inductive structure 
having a controllable variable inductance. A solution of this object is characterized by: an electrically conducting 
first via penetrating the electrically insulating film electrically 
connecting a first end of the first spiral to a first end of the second spiral; 
and an electrically conducting ground plane disposed on the second surface 
of the substrate and a second electrically conducting via passing 
through the substrate from the first to the second surface electrically connecting 
a second end of the first spiral to the ground plane. The invention will be described in the following in more detail while referring 
to the enclosed Figures, in which:  
 
Figure 1(a) is a perspective view of a variable 
inductance according to an embodiment of the 
invention; Figure 1(b) is a schematic diagram 
of an equivalent circuit of the variable inductance 
of Figure 1(a); and Figure 2 is a schematic circuit diagram of a 
modification of the variable inductance of Figure 
1(a). In Figure 1(a), a perspective view of a variable 
inductance according to 
the invention is shown. The variable inductance 
includes two similar spiral inductive structures. 
A spiral 2 includes an electrical 
conductor disposed on an electrically insulating 
substrate and a lead 6 in an air bridge 
structure connecting the internal end 4 of the spiral 
2 to a terminal 7. The external end 3 of the 
spiral 2 is directly connected to a terminal 5. A 
similar spiral 62 is disposed 
on a substrate 1. The two spirals 2 and 62 
are separated by an electrically insulating film 61. 
The terminals of spiral 62 are connected 
to an electrical signal source that causes a 
current to flow through spiral 62. The phase and 
magnitude of that current flow varies the effective 
inductance of spiral 2 because of the mutual
