<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waste treatment 
system in a polishing apparatus, and more particularly to a 
waste treatment system in which waste gas and waste liquid 
discharged from a polishing apparatus can be treated. Recent rapid progress in semiconductor device 
integration demands smaller and smaller wiring patterns or 
interconnections and also narrower spaces between 
interconnections which connect active areas. One of the 
processes available for forming such interconnection is 
photolithography. Though the photolithographic process can 
form interconnections that are at most 0.5 µm wide, it requires 
that surfaces on which pattern images are to be focused on by 
a stepper be as flat as possible because the depth of focus of 
the optical system is relatively small. It is therefore necessary to make the surfaces of 
semiconductor wafers flat for photolithography. One customary 
way of flattening the surfaces of semiconductor wafers is to 
polish them with a polishing apparatus. Conventionally, such a polishing apparatus has not 
been installed in a clean room because dust particles and 
harmful gas are generated by polishing operation from the 
polishing apparatus. Therefore, semiconductor wafers are 
transported into the clean room by means of a wafer carrier 
after they are polished by the polishing apparatus installed  
 
outside the clean room, and then the semiconductor wafers are 
processed to form device layers by processing apparatuses 
installed in the clean room. However, as described above, high integration in a 
semiconductor device demands the semiconductor wafer to be 
multilayer, it is therefore necessary to make each surface of 
the multilayer flat for photolithography. In order to increase 
the productivity of the semiconductor device, the polishing 
apparatus is required to be installed in the clean room of a 
semiconductor manufacturing plant. In the polishing apparatus, abrasive liquid is 
supplied from a nozzle onto an abrasive cloth attached to an 
upper surface of a turntable. The abrasive liquid contains 
abrasive material such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) or cerium 
dioxide (CeO2) having a diameter of 1 µm or less in a liquid. Further, in order to perform chemical polishing in 
addition to mechanical polishing, acid or alkali may be added 
to the abrasive liquid. In this case, acid waste gas or 
alkaline waste gas are liable to be discharged from the 
polishing apparatus. However, since a conventional polishing apparatus is 
not provided with a waste gas treatment
