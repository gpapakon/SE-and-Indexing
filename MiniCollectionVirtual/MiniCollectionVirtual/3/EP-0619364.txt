<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to non-ozone depleting cleaning compositions 
for degreasing elements in manufacturing and engineering processes 

like oily machine parts and for defluxing printed circuit boards, 
used in the electric and electrical industry. The composition 

according to the invention contains at least one C₆₋₁₂ alkyllactate 
ester, preferably 2-ethylhexyl lactate, in an amount of 70-99% by 

weight and at least one emulsifier, preferably n-octanol, in an 
amount of 1-30% by weight. One of the main advantages of the present 

cleaning composition is based on the fact that in the rinsing step 
with water for removing the cleaning composition from the treated 

surface an emulsion is formed, which on the one hand is stable 
enough for having proper rinsing ability and on the other hand - 

after the rinsing step - will separate rather quickly into an oil 
and a water phase. This last mentioned phenomenon provides the 

benifits of reusing the active cleaning agent, i.e. the C₆₋₁₂ alkyllactate 
ester and reusing and/or partly discarding the waste water 

being toxicologically and environmentally safe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to non-ozone depleting cleaning 
compositions for the removal of grease or oil from elements in the 
manufacturing and engineering processes like oily machine parts and 
for defluxing of printed circuit boards within the assembly process. Traditionally either ozone depleting or toxic cleaners are 
used which application is increasingly restricted due to their 
environmental impact. The Montreal protocol of the year 1989 covers 
the phase out of ozone depleting chemicals such as Freon solvents 
e.g. CFC 113 and chlorine type solvents e.g. 1,1,1-trichloroethane. 
For toxicity reasons also methylene chloride and trichloroethylene 
are being replaced. As a result of these phase out schedules the 
industry is searching for alternative cleaners and cleaning 
procedures. In view of the above it is pointed at Japanese application 
2-176176 having a filing date of July 5, 1990. More in particular 
said Japanese application is directed to a cleaning composition as 
substitute for Freons and chlorine type solvents, which composition 
contains as essential ingredients a non-ionic surfactant and one or 
more 1-monocarboxylic acid esters having the formula R₁-COO-R₂, 
wherein R₁ represents an alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms and R₂ 
represents an alkyl group having 1-10 carbon atoms with the proviso 
that the sum of the carbon atoms of the symbols R₁ and R₂ is at least 
7. The concentration of the non-ionic surfactant, used in the 
prior art cleaning composition is in the range of 1-30% by weight. 
Examples of the surfactants are the polyoxyethylene compounds such 
as the polyoxyethylene alkylethers etc. Examples of the monocarboxylic acid esters being used in the 
range of 50-99% of the cleaning compositions are sec-hexyl acetate, 
2-ethylhexyl acetate, isopentyl propionate, butyl butyrate and isopentyl 
isobutyrate. Also various stabilisers and additives like hydrocarbons, 
alcohols, ethers, esters, acetals, ketones, fatty acids, nitroalkanes,  
 
amines, amides, glycols, aminoethanols and benzotriazoles 
can be added to the cleaning compositions in order to preserve the 
stability of the liquid, raise the stability in relation to the 
object to be cleaned or raising the dissolving capacity of the 
composition. Further also anionic surfactants can be added to these 
prior art compositions. It is stated in said Japanese application 2-176176 that the 
compositions in question would have a good finish and a high 
degreasing capacity which matches those of prior cleaners for this 
purpose like
