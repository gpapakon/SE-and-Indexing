<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrofusion coupler (5) for fusing together tubular fusion ends (R1, R2) of thermoplastic or fusible plastics, which is provided with a heating wire winding (2) and with contacts (3, 3') for supplying electric current, this electrofusion coupler (5) having a fusion sleeve (5.1) for receiving the heating-wire winding (2) and a terminating means (5.2). These two each have form-fitting anchoring points for simultaneous radially-locking and axially-locking connection and the anchoring points are designed in the form of interengaging hollows (6, 6') and bulges (7, 7') and/or as terminating means (5.2) engaging over the fusion sleeve (5.1).
