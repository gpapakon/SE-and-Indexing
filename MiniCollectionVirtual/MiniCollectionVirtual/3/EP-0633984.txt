An auxiliary bearing system for a rotor (2) which is supported floating on the stator 
(1), particularly by the generation of a magnetic field between the stator and the 

rotor, without contact, consisting of mechanical auxiliary bearing elements (3, 4) 
which are fixed to the stator (1) at a short distance from the rotor (2) and which 

become effective in the event of a radial migration of the rotor,
 
characterised in that
 
the auxiliary rotor elements (3, 4) have a contact face (6) on at least one side for the 

external support of the rotor (2) and have a contact face (8) on the other side for the 
internal support of the rotor (2), wherein the two contact faces (6, 8) come into 

contact successively with the rotor with increasing radial excursion of the rotor (2), 
and that at least the bearing element (3) which first comes into contact on an 

excursion of the rotor is radially elastically mounted. 
An auxiliary bearing system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the bearing element (3) for the external support of the rotor (2) comes into contact 

first. 
An auxiliary bearing system according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the two contact faces (6, 8) are disposed concentrically with the rotor axis and 

overlapping in the axial direction on the stator (1). 
An auxiliary bearing system according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the contact face (8) for internal support surrounds the contact face (6) for external 

support.  
 
An auxiliary bearing system according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
a sliding ring is used for the construction of at least one of the contact faces (8).
