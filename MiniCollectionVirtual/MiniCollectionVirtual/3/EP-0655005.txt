<ABSTRACT>
An automatic retractable safety penetrating instrument (30) includes a sleeve (34) for being introduced in a body cavity and a penetrating member (32) disposed within the sleeve (34) and having a sharp distal tip (46) for penetrating a wall of the cavity. A retracting mechanism biases the penetrating member (32) to a retracted position wherein the sharp distal tip (46) is in a safe, protected position, and the penetrating member (32) is movable distally from the retracted position to an extended position wherein the sharp distal tip (46) extends beyond a distal end of the sleeve (34). The penetrating member (32) is automatically locked against movement to the retracted position upon axial rotation of a locking and releasing mechanism in response to movement of the penetrating member (32) to the extended position.

 AUTOMATIC RETRACTABLE SAFETY PENETRATING INSTRUMENTCROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of pending patent applications SN 07/800,507, filed November 27, 1991, SN 07/805,506 filed December 6, 1991, SN 07/808,325, filed December 16, 1991, SN 07/848,838, filed March 10, 1992 and SN 07/868,566 and SN 07/868,578, filed April 15, 1992. The specifications of the above patent applications are incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention:The present invention pertains to safety penetrating instruments and, more particularly, to automatic retractable safety penetrating instruments having sleeves for introduction into anatomical cavities and penetrating members with sharp tips disposed within the sleeves for penetrating cavity walls with automatic retraction of the penetrating members into the sleeves upon penetration to protect tissue and organ structures within the cavities from the sharp tips of the penetrating members.Discussion of the Prior Art:Penetrating instruments are widely used in medical procedures to gain access to anatomical cavities ranging in size from the abdomen to small blood vessels, such as veins and arteries, epidural, plural and subachroniad spaces, heart ventricles and pinal and synovial cavities, with access being established via a sleeve positioned during penetration into the cavity with the penetrating instrument. Use of penetrating 

instruments has become an extremely popular and important first step in endoscopic, or least invasive, surgical procedures to establish an endoscopic portal for many various procedures with access being established via portal sleeves of the penetrating instruments. Such penetrating instruments typically include a portal sleeve and a penetrating member disposed within the portal sleeve and having a sharp tip or point to pierce or penetrate the tissue forming the cavity wall with the force required to penetrate the cavity wall being dependent upon the type and thickness of the tissue of the wall. Once the wall is penetrated, it is desirable to prevent the sharp tip of the penetrating member from inadvertent contact with or injury to tissue or organ structures in or forming the cavity, and a particular problem exists where substantial force is required to penetrate the cavity wall or the cavity is very small in that, once penetration is achieved, the lack of tissue resistance can result in the sharp tip traveling too far into the cavity and injuring adjacent tissue or organ
