<DESCRIPTION>
 AN IMPROVED METHOD OF AGROBACTERIUM-MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION OF CULTURED SOYBEAN CELLSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to the production of transgenic soybean plants through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.Background of the InventionSoybean (Glycine max) is one of the world's most important crop plants. It is an annual seed legume grown on more than 50 million hectares for the production of oil and protein. The value of the crop is estimated to be over 20 billion dollars. Each year more than 100 million metric tons of soybean are produced. The development of gene transfer techniques for leguminous plants is of commercial interest because it facilitates the development of new cultivars with improved disease resistance, tolerance to specific herbicides and increased nutritional value. However, molecular approaches for the improvement of soybean are limited by the technology available to produce transgenic soybean plants. Many plants, including several important crop plants, have been genetically modified using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. McCormick, et al. (1986) Plant Cell Rep. 5, 81-84; Radke, et al. (1988) Theor. Appl. Genet. 75, 685-694; Umbeck, et al. (1987) Bio/Technology 5, 263-266; Botteman and Leemans (1988) Trends in Genetics 4, 219-222. Unfortunately, even though some genotypes of these dicotyledonous species are susceptible to Agrobacterium infections (Facciotti et al., (1985) Biotechnology 3, 241-246; Owens and Cress (1985) Plant Physiol. 77, 87-94; Byrne et al. (1987) Plant Cell Tissue and Organ Culture 8, 3-15), the use of Agrobacterium for transformation is limited due to the lack of available and 

efficient transformation and regeneration procedures.Until recently soybean was considered to be outside the host range of Agrobacterium. DeCleene and DeLey (1976) Bacterial Rev. 42, 389-466. Later reports suggested that soybean has a limited susceptibility to Agrobacterium which is soybean genotype and Agrobacterium strain dependent. Byrne, et al. (1987) Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult. 8, 3-15. Only one variety of soybean (Peking) has been successfully transformed, and further, this variety is of no commercial value. Few transgenic soybean plants of this transformable variety have been produced by cocultivation of regenerable explants with Agrobacterium. Hinchee, et al. (1988) Bio/Technology 6, 915- 922. For transformation of soybeans via Agrobacterium- mediated methods to become commercially viable, the method must permit direct transformation of elite

CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A genotype-independent method for producing a transgenic soybean plant which comprises:
a. cocultivating an explant derived from a hypocotyl or cultured cotyledonary nodes of a germinated soybean seed with Agrobacterium species containing a chimeric gene in the presence of a signal compound selected from the group consisting of acetosyringone, α-hydroxyacetosyringone, acetovanillone, syringaldehyde, syringic acid, and sinapinic acid and mixtures thereof;
b. maintaining a temperature for cocultivation of from 18 to 28°C; and
c. inducing virulence of the Agrobacterium by decreasing the pH of the plant culture media below pH 6.0.
2. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the concentration of Agrobacterium cells is from 10
8
 to 3 x 10
9
ml.
3. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the cocultivation is carried out by sequential inoculation of Agrobacterium.
4. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the chimeric gene is a seed storage protein gene.
5. A method according to Claim 1 wherein the chimeric gene is the 2S storage protein from Bertholletia excelsa.
6. A method of regenerating soybean plants from cotyledonary nodes which comprises:
a. dividing the node; 


 b. culturing the divided node on a nutrient medium until callus tissue develops which contains shoots; and
c. removing the shoots from said callus and rooting the shoots on a nutrient medium containing hormone and pyroglutamic acid to form a plantlet.
7. A method according to Claim 6 wherein the rooting medium is Gamborg medium.
8. A method according to Claim 6 wherein said plantlet is transferred to a medium comprising soil and allowed to grow thereon until a whole plant is generated therefrom.
