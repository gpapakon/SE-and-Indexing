<ABSTRACT>
The zirconium-based material proposed according to the invention contains the following components in the following ratio in % by mass: niobium - 0.1-1.5, tin - 0.9-1.5, iron - 0.3-0.6, chromium 0.005-0.2, carbon - 0.005-0.04, oxygen - 0.05-0.15, silicon - 0.005-0.15, zirconium - the remainder. The product according to the invention, which can be used in the active zone of nuclear reactors and is made of the said material has a microstructure which represents a zirconium matrix which is consolidated by particles of tin-containing and iron-containing intermetallic compounds, at least 60% by volume of the total amount of iron-containing intermetallic compounds being made up by particles of the intermetallic compounds of the type Zr(Nb,Fe)2, Zr(Fe,Cr,Nb), (ZrNb)3Fe, with a distance between the particles of from 0.20 to 0.40  mu m. The method for producing products which can be used in the active zone of nuclear reactors and are made of the said material, comprises the production of a block, beta-pretreatment of the block, producing a blank by hot forming (hot working) of the block at the existence temperature of alpha -zirconium, annealing at a temperature of from 380 to 650 DEG C, cold forming (cold working) of the blank with interannealing stages at the existence temperature of  alpha -zirconium, and finishing the blank until a finished product has been produced.
