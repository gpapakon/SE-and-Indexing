<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to running gear for rail vehicles in which a running gear frame (2) is carried by the wheels or wheel sets (1) by means of primary springs, and on which the coach body (4) or the coach body (4) of the rail vehicle is directly supported by means of secondary springs (3) via a rocker (5), and the rocker (5) or the coach body (4) is also connected with respect to the running gear frame (2) by means of shock absorbers which damp vertical and rolling movements and at least one rail support (8-10) which absorbs rolling movements and bears fixed levers (9) which are connected to the rocker (5) or to the coach body (4) via pendulum element (10) which are mounted in an articulated fashion. The object of the invention is, with the aim of achieving a maximum possible coach cross-section, to find an inclination device in which, during the rolling of the coach body (4) when there is an excess of centrifugal force, as far as possible the centre of motion lies in the plane of the centre of rolling, which inclination device can be retrofitted on existing running gear, can be used under existing coach bodies (4) and is distinguished by simple constructional elements. This object is achieved in that at least one of the pendulum elements (10) of the roller support consists of an actuator which can be acted on in the opposite direction when one transverse end of the rocker (5) or one side of the coach body (4) dips or rises.

Running gear for rail vehicles, in which a 
running gear frame is supported, via primary springs, by 

the wheels or wheelsets and on which the coach body is 
supported via secondary springs, by means of a bolster, 

or on which the coach body of the rail vehicle is directly 
supported, and on which, furthermore, the bolster or 

coach body is connected, relative to the running gear 
frame, by means of shock absorbers, which dampen vertical 

and rolling motions, and at least one roll-support, which 
cushions rolling motions and supports fixed levers 

connected by hinge-mounted pendulums to the bolster or 
coach body, characterized in that at least one of the 

pendulums (10) comprises a final control element, which, 
when a transverse end of the bolster (5) or a side of the 

coach body (4) plunges or rises, can be actuated in the 
counter-direction. 
Running gear according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that both pendulums (10) comprise final control 

elements. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the final control elements are lockable. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the final control elements are lockable 

in the end position. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that at least one final control element is 

equipped on both sides of the longitudinal axis of the 
rail vehicle with a path-measuring instrument measuring 

the necessary lifting motion of the final control 
elements in order to compensate for the rolling motion. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that two roll-supports (8 to 10) are disposed 

symmetrically to the transverse axis of the running gear, 
having pendulums (10) comprising final control elements. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the final control element comprises a 

working cylinder. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized  
 

in that the final control element is configured 
as a mechanical linear drive mechanism. 
Running gear for rail vehicles, in which a 
running gear frame is supported, via primary springs, by 

the wheels or wheelsets and on which the coach body is 
supported via secondary springs, by means of a bolster, 

or on which the coach body of the rail vehicle is directly 
supported, and on which, furthermore, the bolster or 

coach body is connected, relative to the running gear 
frame, by means of shock absorbers, which dampen vertical 

and rolling motions, and at least one roll-support, which 
cushions rolling motions and supports fixed levers 

connected by hinge-mounted pendulums to the bolster or 
coach body, characterized in that there is integrated 

into a torsion shaft (8) of the roll-support (8 to 10) a 
final control element, that [sic]
, when a transverse end 
of the bolster (5) or a side of the coach body (4) 

plunges or rises, can be actuated in the counter-direction.
