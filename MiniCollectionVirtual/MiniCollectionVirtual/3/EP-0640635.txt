<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an epoxy resin, an epoxy 
resin composition, to a curable composition comprising said epoxy 
resin or said epoxy resin composition, to the use of such a curable 
composition and to articles comprising said curable composition 
when it has been cured. The epoxy resin and the epoxy resin 
composition according to the present invention have a low viscosity 
and are relatively stable liquids at low temperatures and articles 
comprising the curable epoxy resin composition according to the 
present invention in the cured state have an excellent combination 
of high glass transition point (Tg) and low water absorption. The 
epoxy resin according to the present invention is especially useful 
in adhesives, casting compositions, sealants, moulding compositions 
and laminating compositions. The conventional liquid epoxy resins such as bisphenol A-type 
epoxy resins or bisphenol F-type epoxy resins used in adhesives, 
casting compositions, sealants, laminating compositions, moulding 
compositions and coatings, often do not provide the desired level 
of heat resistance and water resistance for said application areas. Multifunctional epoxy resins such as novolak-type epoxy 
resins, tri-functional epoxy resins and tetra-functional epoxy 
resins though having improved heat resistance, either have an 
extremely high viscosity or are solid at room temperature, so that 
they cannot be processed as liquids. Other known liquid epoxy resins derived from amine compounds 
such as aminophenols and xylenediamines have excellent heat 
resistance and have a low viscosity but poor water resistance. Epoxy resins with a rigid skeleton such as, for example, 
biphenol X-type epoxy resins, bisphenol S-type epoxy resins and 
hydroquinone-type epoxy resins, have excellent heat resistance and 
though having a low molecular weight (because of their rigid 
skeletons) their crystallization tendency is strong so that they  
 
often crystallize at room temperature as a result whereof it is 
difficult to process them as liquids. Japanese Patent Application publication No. 4-211420 discloses 
a method of reacting a liquid epoxy resin and an unsaturated 
monocarboxylic acid in order to prevent crystallization of the 
liquid epoxy resin. However, the tendency to crystallize of the 
resulting modified epoxy resins is still too high and simply 
raising the degree of modification of the epoxy resin by increasing 
the amount of the unsaturated carboxylic acid used in the 
modification process in order to decrease the
