<DESCRIPTION>
In US-4,962,115 there are described N-(3-hydroxy-4-piperidinyl)benzamide
derivatives having gastro-intestinal motility stimulating activity. In JP-A-2-104572
there are also described benzamide derivatives having digestive tract hypergic
action. EP-A-0,278,173 discloses the use of heterocyclic derivatives of among
others which are benzoic acid, acting as 5HT3-antagonists for treating depression.
Chemical Abstracts (1988), 108, 49149t discloses that cisapride probably has
5HT2-antagonistic activity. GB-A-2207673 discloses 2,4,5-tri-substituted
benzamide derivatives as having pharmacological properties rendering them useful
as antiemetic agents and in the treatment of a wide range of gastrointestinal
disorders of somatic, psychosomatic and iatrogenic origin.The present compounds differ structurally and show unexpectedly high affinity as
ligands for the 5HT2-receptor, yielding strong and specific 5HT2-antagonism.The present invention is concerned with compounds having the formula

the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and the stereoisomeric
forms thereof, wherein
R1 represents hydrogen or halo;R2 represents halo;R3 represents hydrogen or halo;R4 and R5 each independently represent hydrogen, C1-4alkyl or haloC1-4alkyl; andAlk represents C2-4alkanediyl.In the foregoing definitions and hereinafter halo defines fluoro, chloro, bromo
and iodo; C1-4alkyl defines straight and branch chained saturated hydrocarbon
radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl,
butyl, 1-methylethyl and 2-methylpropyl ; C2-4alkanediyl defines bivalent
straight or branch chained hydrocarbon radicals containing from 2 to 4 carbon
atoms such as, for example, 1,2-ethanediyl, 1,3-propanediyl, 1,4-butanediyl and
the branched isomers thereof.The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore and hereinafter
defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I)
may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation
of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric
forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic
molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or
S-configuration. The present invention clearly intends to embrace in its scope
both the individual stereochemically isomeric forms as well as mixtures thereof.
It has to be understood that, when mixtures of enantiomers are present, they may
be separated according to classical
