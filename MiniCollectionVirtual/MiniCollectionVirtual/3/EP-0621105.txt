<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a 
separator/feeder for headed fasteners, which is simple in 

structure and small in size. The present invention provides 
a separator/feeder (1) having a housing (8) which has an 

inlet to receive a headed fastener (3) from a chute rail (2) 
and an outlet for feeding the headed fastener to a fastener 

setting machine or the like, a drum (9) rotatably mounted in 
the housing (8), and an actuator to rotate the drum. The 

drum (9) is formed with a recessed portion (12) to receive a 
single headed fastener in a corresponding position to the 

housing inlet (6) and the recessed portion (12) is provided 
with a pin (13) which can be extended therefrom. The pin is 

biased by a spring (16) to a retracted position. The 
housing (8) is provided with a path (18) for directing the 

headed fastener received in the recessed portion to the 
outlet when the drum is rotated. A pressurised air 

supplying port (19) is provided to send the headed fastener 
in the recessed portion out onto the path by extending the 

pin in the recessed portion when the recessed portion of the 
rotated drum meets the path (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
separator/feeder for headed fasteners, sent one by one in a
line from a chute rail, and to feed them to a fastener
setting machine or the like, comprising the features of the
preamble of claim 1 (of JP-U-57-135523).Such a separator/feeder for headed fastener for
headed fasteners, is disclosed, for example, in Japanese
Utility Model No. 57-135523. Such devices are widely used
with automatic fastener setting machines since they can
separate and feed headed fasteners, sent one by one in a
line from a chute rail and feed them to a fastener setting
machine.The conventional separator/feeder for headed
fastener as described in the publication referred to above
has a mechanism which is complex in structure using a cam, a
sliding plate and a spring and the device itself is
inevitably large in size.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a small and simply constructed separator/feeder for
headed fasteners. This object is achieved by means of a separator/
feeder Comprising the features of claim 1.There is
provided a separator/feeder for headed fasteners for
separating headed fasteners, sent one by one in a line from
a chute rail, and feeding them to a fastener setting machine
or the like; characterised in that the separator/feeder has
a housing having an inlet to receive headed fasteners from
the chute rail and an outlet to feed the headed fasteners to
the fastener setting machine, a drum rotatably mounted in
the housing and means to rotate the drum, and the drum is
formed with a recessed portion at a position corresponding
to the inlet of the housing to receive the headed fasteners
one only at a time; said recessed portion being provided
with a pin extending diametrically from the opposite side,
the pin being normally biased to a retracted position so as
to allow the fastener to get into the recessed portion, the
housing also being provided with a path for receiving the 
headed fastener received in the recessed portion of the
rotated drum and sending it to the outlet, the housing being
provided with means to extend the pin into the recessed
portion when the recessed portion of the rotated drum meets
the path so that the headed fastener in the recessed portion
can be sent onto the path.In order that the invention be better understood,
a preferred embodiment will now be described in further
detail by way of example with reference to and as
illustrated by the accompanying drawings in which:-

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A separator/feeder (1) for headed fasteners (3), sent one
by one in a line from a chute rail (2), to feed them to a

fastener setting machine or the like; whereby
the separator/feeder (1) has a housing (8) having an inlet (6) to

receive headed fasteners (3) from the chute rail (2) and an outlet (7)
to feed the headed fasteners (3) to the fastener setting

machine, a drum (9) rotatably mounted in the housing (8) and means (10)
to rotate the drum (9), and the drum (9) is formed with a recessed

portion (12) at a position
which in a first rotatable position of the drum (9)

corresponds to the inlet (6) of the
housing (8) to receive the headed fasteners (3) one only at a time;

characterised in that
said recessed portion (12) is provided with a pin (13) extending

diametrically from the opposite side of the drum (9), the pin being normally
biased to a retracted position so as to allow the fastener (3)

to get into the recessed portion (12), the housing (8) also being
provided with a path (18) for receiving the headed fastener (3)

received in the recessed portion (12) of the rotated drum
(9) in a second rotatable position and

sending it to the outlet (7), the housing (8) being provided with
means (19) to extend the pin (13) into the recessed portion (12) when the

recessed portion (12) of the rotated drum (9) meets the path (18) so that
the headed fastener (3) in the recessed portion (12) can be sent onto

the path (18).
