<ABSTRACT>
In a hammer-strikable, powder-actuated, fastener 
driving tool (10), a breech block (50) is mounted within 

a generally tubular body (20) by several resilient shock 
absorber structures (200), each including an elastomeric 

grommet (202), an eyelet (204) having a tubular portion 
(206) surrounded by the grommet (202) and an annular 

portion (208), a washer (210) interposed between the 
annular portion (208) and one end of the grommet (202), and 

a screw (212) attaching the breech block (50) to the body 
(20). The screw shank (216) extends through the grommet 

(202). The screw head (214) bears against the washer 
(210). The breech block (50) mounts a firing pin (80), 

which is biased backwardly to a normal position, and to 
which a hammer-strikable button (110) is connected. A 

barrel (22) mounted on the body (20) so as to be axially 
movable has an elongate slot (136). A stud (170) mounted 

on the body extends through the slot (136). A washer 
disposed around the stud is biased against the barrel so as 

to impart frictional drag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to improvements in a 
hammer-strikable, powder-actuated, fastener-driving tool. Hammer-strikable, powder-actuated, fastener-driving 
tools are used commonly to drive fasteners, such as drive 
pins, into concrete, masonry, or steel structures. Such a 
tool derives its motive power from blank cartridges 
containing gunpowder. Such tools are exemplified in Rostas U.S. Patent No. 
4,025,029, Brosius U.S. Patent No. 4,252,259, Kopf U.S. 
Patent No. 4,493,376, Hawkins U.S. Patent No. 4,651,912, 
Gottlieb et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,830,252, and Hawkins 
U.S. Patent No. 4,890,778. Such a tool may have a tool 
body defining a handle, a breech block mounted within the 
tool body via screws received by the tool body, and a 
firing pin movable within the breech block, over a range 
of firing pin movement. The firing pin is biased so as to 
be normally disposed in a dormant position at a back 
extreme of the range and is capable of being impelled to a 
firing position at a front extreme of the range when the 
firing pin or a structure connected to the firing pin is 
struck forcibly with a hammer. Thus, when the firing pin causes a cartridge loaded 
into the tool to fire, a fastener is driven forcibly from 
a muzzle via a piston and a driving blade. Also, explosive 
forces are produced, which impart high stresses on the 
tool particularly where the tool body receives screws or 
other fasteners mounting the breech block within the tool 
body. According to this invention a hammer-strikable, 
powder-actuated, fastener driving tool adapted to be fired 
to drive a fastener from the tool, comprises: 
(a) a generally tubular body having a portion 
defining a handle;  (b) a breech block mounted within the body for 
movement relative thereto in response to firing the tool; (c) a firing pin mounted within the breech block for 
axial movement toward and away from a firing position; and (d) a shock absorber structure disposed between the 
breech block and the body to absorb stresses imparted to 
the tool when the tool is fired to thereby enhance tool 
life and reduce recoil imposed on the hand of the user. The shock absorber structure is disposed within the 
tool body to absorb high stresses imparted between the 
breech block and the tool body when a cartridge loaded into 
the tool is fired by the firing pin. As will be described 
in detail, the stresses are absorbed through resilient 
means permitting the breech block to move rearwardly a 
short distance relative to the tool body when the tool is 
fired.

<CLAIMS>
A hammer-strikable, powder-actuated, fastener driving 
tool (10) adapted to be fired to drive a fastener (12) from 

the tool (10), comprising: 

(a) a generally tubular body (20) having a portion 
(24) defining a handle, 
(b) a breech block (50) mounted within the body (20) 
for movement relative thereto in response to firing the 

tool, 
(c) a firing pin (80) mounted within the breech block 
(50) for axial movement toward and away from a firing 

position, and 
(d) a shock absorber structure (200) disposed between 
the breech block (50) and the body (20) to absorb stresses 

imparted to the tool when the tool is fired to thereby

the user. 
A tool according to claim 1, further comprising a 
button (110) adapted to be forcibly struck by a hammer and 

connected to the firing pin (80) so as to be conjointly 
movable with the firing pin (80) and so as to be normally 

disposed in a position near an end of the generally tubular 
body (20) where the button can be forcibly struck to impel
