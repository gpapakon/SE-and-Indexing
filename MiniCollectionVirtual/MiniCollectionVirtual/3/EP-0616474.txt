<ABSTRACT>
A television circuit (1⊘) according to the invention 
includes a multiplier (12), and a voltage signal (V1) is 

outputted from an LPF (22) in accordance with the 
presence or absence of a color burst signal which is to 

be inputted to the multiplier (12). A rectangular-wave 
signal (Va) is obtained on the basis of the voltage 

signal (V1) through a peak holding circuit (24) and a 
sampling/holding circuit (42). A rectangular-wave signal 

(Vc) is obtained by averaging the rectangular-wave signal 
(Va) and a rectangular-wave signal (Vb) which is obtained 

by delaying the signal (Va) by a 1H delay circuit (44) by 
an adder (46) and a 1/2 multiplication circuit (48). On 

the basis of the rectangular-wave signal (Vc), a voltage 
signal (V3) is produced by an LPF (52) having a 

relatively small time constant, which is compared with a 
reference voltage (Vref) by a level-comparator (54), 

whereby a signal is outputted. The signal is used as a 
color killer signal for a color killer circuit, for 

example.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television
circuit utilizing a color burst signal. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a
television circuit which utilizes a color burst signal
and is used in a color killer circuit, an ACC circuit, an
APC circuit, and a color reproducing circuit or a
television receiver which is provided with the circuits
therein.With referring to Figure 2⊘, in a conventional color
killer circuit 1, a color burst signal and a sub-carrier
signal are inputted to a multiplier 2, whereby an output
according to the presence or absence of the color burst
signal is applied to an LPF 3, and thus, a voltage signal
V1 as shown in Figure 21(A) is outputted for each
horizontal line from the LPF 3. In addition, although
such a voltage signal V1 has a time width, in Figure
21(A), the same is illustrated as a line to simplify the
illustration. This is also applied to Figure 6(A) and
Figure 14(A). A peak hold signal V2 shown in Figure 21(B) is
outputted from a peak holding circuit 4 to which the
voltage signal V1 is applied, and a voltage signal V3 as
shown in Figure 21(C) is outputted from an LPF 5, whereby
a color killer signal as shown in Figure 21(D) can be
outputted from a level-comparator 6. That is, in
receiving a color television signal, the color killer
signal of the high level is outputted, thereby not to
perform a color killer operation, and in receiving a
monochrome television signal, the color killer signal of
the low level is outputted, thereby to perform the color
killer operation.In such a conventional color killer circuit 1, if a
time constant of the LPF 5 is made small, there occurs an
erroneous operation as follows: In a case where the
voltage signal V1 is largely affected by a noise as shown
in a period X in Figure 21(A), the voltage signal V3 is
also largely affected by the noise, and therefore, there
occurs a period (a) (Figure 21(C)) during which the
voltage signal V3 becomes smaller than a reference
voltage Vref in spite of a color television signal.
Therefore, due to the influence of the noise, the color
killer signal of the low level is outputted as shown in
Figure 21(D), and the color killer operation is
erroneously performed. On the other hand, if the time constant of the LPF 5
is made be large, since the peak hold signal V2 is more
smoothed, and therefore, the voltage signal V3 is not
made be small to a level that is lower than the reference
voltage Vref; however, in a case where the television
signal being received is changed from a color television
signal
