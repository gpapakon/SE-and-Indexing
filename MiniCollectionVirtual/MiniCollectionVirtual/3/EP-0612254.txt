<ABSTRACT>
A prefilled syringe system is provided for two component pharmaceuticals, which is a combination of a first subassembly consisting of a capped bottomless pharmaceutical vial (2) containing a first component and closed at its bottom end by a piston (32) which can be connected to a plunger (16) and a second subassembly (3) consisting of a shell (4) containing a second component and closed by a further piston (6) and located in telescopable relationship with the plunger, a cap (18) which can be forced onto the cap (36) of the bottomless vial, and a double ended needle (320) or a functionally equivalent cannula assembly which is caused to pierce both pistons as the assemblies are connected by forcing the cap (18) onto the bottomless vial, thus placing the vials in communication. The shell vial (4) is pressed towards the bottomless vial (2) to express its contents into the latter, and the plunger (16) and shell vial (4) are then removed so that the cap (18) and needle (20) are left connected to the bottomless vial (2) and the plunger (16) may be connected to the piston (32) of the bottomless vial to convert it into a syringe. The shell vial may telescope either over or within the plunger. In the first case, the plunger acts to operate the piston of the shell vial during expression of its contents, whereas in the latter case a separate component (8) is required for this purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prefilled syringe systems 
for the packaging of pharmaceutical preparations in dosage 
form, and more particularly to systems in which two 
components of a preparation, one of which is normally a 
diluent or solvent, must be stored separately and only 
admixed immediately prior to administration. The applicants own prior application EP-A-0,298,585 describes 
several syringe systems for the packaging of two component 
pharmaceutical preparations, of which the system shown in 
Figures 11 and 12 is presently the most preferred. This 
system stores a solvent or diluent component in a specially 
formed flexible capsule 14, which is described in detail in that 
patent, and from which the contents are expelled by manual squeezing. Shell vials are however a well known and widely 
available packaging for pharmaceutical diluents, and it would 
be desirable to utilise such a vial in a two component syringe 
system, so as to avoid the use of a specially designed capsule of 
the type shown in EP-A-0,298,585. A shell  
 
vial differs from a conventional pharmaceutical or serum 
vial in that it has no neck. Instead the top of the vial 
is of the same diameter as the remainder of the cylindrical 
side wall of the vial, and is closed by a piston quite 
similar to that utilized by the present applicant to close 
the bottom of its bottomless vial as described in EP-A-0,298,585 I have now found that the construction shown in 
EP-A-0,298,585 can be advantageously modified to utilize known 
shell vials in place of the capsule 14. According to the invention, a prefilled syringe 
system for two component pharmaceuticals is provided, as 
set forth in the appended claims 1-5.  
 Preferred embodiments of the invention are 
described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figures 1A-1I are elevations illustrating 
successive stages in the assembly and preparation of use of 
a first embodiment of the invention, it being assumed for 
ease in illustration that most components other than those 
of rubber or metal are transparent; and Figures 2A-2G are elevations illustrating 
successive stages in the assembly and preparation for use 
of a second embodiment of the invention. Figure 1A shows an exploded view of the components 
of a separately assembled and sterilized unit 3 (see Figure 
1B) for use in conjunction with a filled and capped vial 2 
generally similar to that shown in Figure 12 of EP-A-0 298 585. 
The unit 3 comprises a shell vial having a 
cylindrical body 4 closed at one end, and

<CLAIMS>
A prefilled syringe system for two component 
pharmaceuticals, comprising the combination of first and 

second sub-assemblies, of which the first sub-assembly 
comprises a bottomless pharmaceutical vial (2) containing a 

first component of a pharmaceutical product, said vial 
having a filling neck, a penetrable closure retained on said 

neck by a first annular cap (30), and an open bottom end 
hermetically closed by a first piston (32) with a 

coupling configuration on the face of the first piston adjacent the open 
bottom end within the vial, and the 

second sub-assembly (3) comprises a receptacle (4) for a second, 
fluid component of the pharmaceutical product, a tubular 

plunger (16) having a coupling (17) at one end for 
subsequent coupling to the coupling configuration (14) of 

said first piston (32), a second cap (18) releasably 
connected to said plunger which can be force fitted to said 

first cap (30), and cannula means (20) projectable by force 
fitting of said first cap (30) to said second cap (18) to 

penetrate said penetrable closure, characterized in that 
said receptacle of said second sub-assembly comprises a 

shell vial (4) having an open end closed by a second piston 
(6), said tubular plunger (16) being concentric and in 

telescoping relationship with said shell vial, and in that 
said cannula means (20) is also projectable, upon force 

fitting of said first cap (30) to said second cap (18), to 
penetrate said second piston (6) and place said bottomless 

vial (2) and said shell vial (4) in fluid communication 
through said cannula means (2), whereby fluid from the shell 

vial is transferred to the bottomless vial upon telescoping 
said shell vial relative to said plunger (16). 
A syringe system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the shell vial (4) is of a diameter to 

telescope into said plunger (16), and adaptor means (8) are 
provided in said second subassembly extending between said 

second cap (18) and a coupling configuration (14) on said 
second piston (6) to maintain the position of the latter 

during telescoping of the shell vial relative to the  
 

plunger. 
A syringe system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the shell vial (4) is of a diameter to 

telescope around said plunger (16), and said means (17) on 
the plunger for coupling to the coupling configuration of 

the first piston (32) are initially coupled to coupling 
means (14) on the second piston (6). 
A syringe system according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the components of the second 

subassembly (3) are assembled within a tubular housing (40), 
and the shell vial (4) is a press fit within the tubular 

housing. 
A syringe system according to any one of claims 1-4, 
characterized in that the cannula means (20) is a double 

ended needle, with a flange (24) to control its longitudinal 
position received within the second cap (18).
