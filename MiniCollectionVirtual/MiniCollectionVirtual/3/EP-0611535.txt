<CLAIMS>
Divider element (11) for longitudinally displaceable arrangement at an upwardly
projecting lateral boundary wall (5) of a deposit surface, a storage surface especially a

shelf (21), with a divider leaf (13) which is rigidly connected with a divider base part (12)
and oriented substantially at right angles thereto, wherein the divider base part (12) is

constructed as a clamping yoke with limbs (15, 15) for clamping of the divider element (11)
onto the boundary wall (5) and has such a width (B) at right angles to the divider leaf (13)

and in ratio to the length (I) thereof that the divider element (11) together with its divider
leaf (13) remains undisplaced in its predetermined position on the boundary wall (5) even

in the case of force acting laterally on the divider leaf, wherein the limbs (15, 16) of the
clamping yoke and the boundary wall (5) have retaining elements (19, 119) which are

capable of co-operating in the manner of a groove-and-tongue connection and which are
arranged between the clamping elements (18, 118) provided at the limbs (15, 16).
Divider element according to claim 1, characterised in that the retaining elements
(19, 119) which are capable of co-operating in the manner of a groove-and-tongue

connection are provided on the outer side, which is remote from the divider leaf (13), of the
boundary wall (5).
Divider element according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the
retaining elements (19, 119) which are capable of cooperating in the manner of a groove-and-tongue

connection are provided approximately in the middle of the limb (16), which
faces the outer side of the boundary wall (5), of the divider base part (12).
Divider element according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that for
formation of the retaining elements (19, 119) which are capable of cooperating in the

manner of a groove-and-tongue connection a groove (19) is provided on the inner side of
the limb (16) associated with the outer side of the boundary wall (5) and a tongue

constructed as a continuous spring strip (119) is provided at the outer side of the boundary
wall (5).
Divider element according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that dog strips
(17), which serve as abutments for the
 seating of the divider base part (12) on the upper
edge of the boundary wall (5), are arranged at the inner sides of the two limbs (15, 16) and 

above the retaining elements (19, 119) which are capable of cooperating in the manner of
a groove-and-tongue connection.
Divider element according to claim 1, characterised in that the clamping elements
(18, 118) are interrupted by one or more free recesses (112).
Divider element according to one of claims 1 and 6, characterised in that the
clamping elements (18, 118) are arranged at the lateral edge regions (R) of the limbs (15,

16) of the divider base part.
