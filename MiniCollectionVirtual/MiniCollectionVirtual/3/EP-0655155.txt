<ABSTRACT>
A device for securing an electronic module casing comprises an intermediate part (6) to which the casing (1) is fixed, and a rail (5a) receiving the casing (1) and the intermediate part (6). The intermediate part (6) has a locking component (21) with a hook (30) to hold the locking component in a retracted position by cooperating with a complementary projection on the intermediate part (6), the locking component being released when the intermediate part (6) and the casing (1) are fitted to the rail (5a).

A device for fixing at least one electronic module housing (1) for 
displaying information relating to goods exposed in a shop, and in 

particular in a retail shop, the device comprising a rail (5a) 
designed to receive the housing (1) and an intermediate part (6) 

which carries at least one resilient locking member (21) having at 
least one projection designed to co-operate with a groove presented 

by the rail (5) for the purposing of holding said housing (1) 
relative to said rail (5a), the housing (1) and said intermediate 

part (6) presenting complementary means (35) for fixing said housing 
(1) on said intermediate part (6), the device being characterized in 

that the locking element (21) has a catch (30) designed to co-operate 
with a complementary projection on the intermediate part (6) to hold 

said locking element (21) in a retracted position against resilient 
urging thereof, the projection (25) then being disengaged relative to 

the groove (13) of the rail with which it co-operates, the 
intermediate part (6) having a resilient branch (32) which, while the 

housing (1) and the intermediate part (6) are being installed on the 
rail (5a), is urged back by the web (7) of said rail coming into 

contact with the catch (30), so as to disengage the catch from the 
complementary projection with which it co-operates, the locking 

element (21) then resiliently urging the projection into the groove 
of the rail (5a). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the rail (5a) 
has a web (7) and two longitudinally-extending flanges (8, 9) on 

either side of the web (7), together with two inside grooves (13) 
carried by respective ones of the flanges (8, 9) and extending along 

the web (7) in the immediate vicinity thereof. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
intermediate part (6) carries a resilient branch (32) terminated by a 

head portion (34), the back of the housing (1) having a recess 
designed to receive said head portion (34), said branch (32) being 

urged during installation of the housing (1) and the intermediate 
part (6) on the rail (5a) by coming into contact with the web (7) of 

said rail, thereby causing said head portion (34) to engage in said  
 

recess so as to lock the housing (1) relative to said intermediate 
part (6). 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
at least one projection (25) has serrations (27) designed to co-operate 

with complementary means carried by the groove (13) which cooperates 
with said projection (25), for the purpose of securing the 

housing (1) longitudinally relative to the rail (5a). 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
serrations (27) are distributed along the entire length of at least 

one of the grooves (13) in the rail. 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the bottom of 
at least one of the grooves in the rail is made of a material in 

which the serrations of the serrated projection are designed to 
penetrate for engagement purposes. 
A device according to claim 2 taken on its own or in combination 
with any one of claims 3 to 6, characterized in that the bottom 

flange (8) of the rail (5a) has a flat slot (12) open to the face of 
said flange (8) facing away from the top flange (9) and designed to 

receive and carry publicity supports or the like. 
A device according to claim 2 taken on its own or in combination 
with any one of claims 3 to 7, for fixing the housing (1) on shelving 

(2), characterized in that the rail (5a) is a portion of section bar 
(5) also having a sill (10) that extends substantially at right 

angles to the web (7) of the rail (5a), the sill (10) and the web (7) 
of the rail (5a) being designed to bear against the top face and the 

edge of the shelf (4), respectively. 
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the rail (5a) 
and the sill (10) are fixed to the shelf (2) by riveting, and have 

longitudinal grooves (11) for receiving the heads of the rivets.
