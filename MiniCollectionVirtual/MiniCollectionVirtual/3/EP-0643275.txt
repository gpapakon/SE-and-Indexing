<ABSTRACT>
A system for controlling operation of a refrigerating device, which 
system comprises: a refrigerant circuit (9), in which a compressor (1), a 

condenser (6), a receiver (4), a pressure-reducing valve (5) and an evaporator 
(3) are connected to one another; and a cycle change-over mechanism 

(2) for changing over a refrigeration cycle of the refrigerant circuit (9) between 
the forward operation and the reverse operation; a refrigerating device, 

in which the pressure-reducing valve (5) is disposed on the downstream 
side of the receiver (4) during either one of the refrigerating cycles, 

is of an accumulatorless structure, and liquid back-flow to the compressor 
at the time of a cycle change-over is prevented. The top portion of the receiver 

(4) is connected to a liquid line on the downstream side of the pressure-reducing 
valve (5) through a bypass path (4a), and an on-off valve 

(SV) is provided in this bypass path (4a). The on-off valve (SV) is controlled 
to be opened for a predetermined time before the cycle is switched 

to a reverse cycle defrost operation. With this arrangement, a liquid refrigerant 
is recovered by the receiver (4) to prevent liquid back-flow. The on-off 

valve (SV) of the bypass path (4a) is opened from the time, at which defrost 

progresses to a certain extent, to the completion of defrost during the 
reverse cycle defrost operation. With this arrangement, an excessive reduction 

of the low pressure and the liquid back-flow are prevented. After an 
electric expansion valve (5) as being the pressure-reducing valve and the 

on-off valve (SV) are closed for a predetermined time upon completion of 
the defrost, the electric expansion valve (5) is openend to a small degree 

and the on-off valve (SV) is opened for a predetermined time. With this arrangement, 
the rise of the high pressure is controlled and the liquid back-flow 

is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
controlling operation of a refrigeration device which is 
arranged to perform a reverse cycle defrost operation and, 
more particularly, to an arrangement for preventing liquid 
back-flow to a compressor. An air conditioning system including a 
refrigerant circuit wherein a compressor, a heat source-side 
heat exchanger, a pressure-reducing valve, and a 
utilization end-side heat exchanger are sequentially 
connected and wherein its refrigerating cycle is switchable 
between forward cycle and reverse cycle, has been known 
which, as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility Model 
Application Laid-Open No. 63-15434, can perform a so-called 
reverse cycle defrost operation such that when, during a 
heating operation, frosting occurs at the heat-source-side 
heat exchanger, the refrigerant circuit, upon receipt of a 
defrost command, is operative to switch the refrigerating 
cycle to a cooling cycle so that a discharge gas 
refrigerant (hot gas) is flowed into the heat source-side  
 
heat exchanger for a predetermined time or until the 
temperature at the heat-source-side heat exchanger rises to 
more than a predetermined temperature value, whereby the 
frost at the heat-source-side heat exchanger is melted for 
restoring the capability of the heat exchanger. In such an air conditioning system, when, at the 
beginning or end of a defrost operation, the refrigerating 
cycle is forwardly or reversely changed, liquid refrigerant 
begins to flow toward the compressor as a result of a 
functional change to an evaporator of the heat-source-side 
heat exchanger or utilization-side heat exchanger, which 
has been functioning as a condenser and which, therefore, 
has a large amount of liquid refrigerant stored therein. 
In such conventional type of air conditioning system, 
therefore, an accumulator is disposed before the compressor 
to absorb the liquid refrigerant thereby to prevent liquid 
back-flow to the compressor. With the accumulator so disposed, however, the 
system may involve various troubles including a power 
decrease due to pressure reduction, and separation of oil 
and liquid refrigerant into two phases. Essentially, 
therefore, an accumulatorless arrangement is desired. The present invention has been developed in view 
of the foregoing facts, and accordingly it is an object of  
 
the invention to provide means for causing liquid 
refrigerant to be efficiently received into the receiver at 
the start/end of each defrost operation and before a mode
