<ABSTRACT>
A new small sized tag cover of compact disk for prevention of shoplifting 
is developed. The shoplifting prevention tag 24 is not easily 

damaged or taken out from compact disk housing case 10. The compact 
disk is prevented from being stolen. The shoplifting prevention tag 24 

is recycled for next use. The tag cover 18 of compact disk for prevention 
of shoplifting is comprised of first engagement portion 20b having 

first engagement piece 20a to be inserted to first groove 14a of lid 
portion 14 of the compact disk housing case 10, second connecting portion 

22 having second engagement piece 22a to be inserted to second groove 
14b of the lid portion 14, connecting portion 20c to retain the housing 

case 10 in closed condition clamping said housing case 10 together 
with said first and second engagement pieces 20a, 22a, and locking mechanism 

to retain the lid portion 14 in closed condition. The shoplifting 
prevention tag 24 is attached to a position on either the first engagement 

portion 20b, second engagement portion 22 or the connecting portion 
20c so that said tag 24 is not easily taken out from outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tag cover of compact disks for prevention of
shoplifting in a sales store or rental shop of compact disks. The tag cover
is provided for interaction with an
electric wave
or electromagnetic shoplifting detection system so as to protect against shoplifting in a sales store
or rental shop of compact disks.In the early days of compact disks, sales stores or rental shops of
compact disks (hereinafter called as CD) adopted an
electric wave or electromagnetic shoplifling detection system. The
system for prevention of shoplifting is composed to react to a shoplifting
for prevention of shoplifting is composed to react to a shoplifting
prevention tag attached to a CD case cover. Consequently, when a customer
passes through entrance or exit of the sales store or rental shop taking
CD with shoplifting prevention tag with him, a warning signal is issued.
Therefore, most sales stores or rental shops of CD adopted the shoplifting
prevention tags to attach to each of the CD goods displayed. The
clerk removes said shoplifting prevention tag attached when customer handed
the CD to him at exit. In such a way the sales store or rental shop of
CD could succeed to prevent the CD from being shoplifted.In former days, most sales stores of CD sticked said shoplifting prevention
tag on the wrapping paper of a CD housing case or inserted said 
tag inside the wrapping paper of CD housing case, whereas most rental
shops of CD directly sticked said tag on the CD housing case or only
inserted said tag inside the CD housing case.However, in sales stores there occurred a problem that the store requires
a large amount of running cost because the shoplifting prevention
tags are sticked on the wrapping papers of the CD housing case and they
are not recycled for next use. Furthermore, it is easy to strip off the
tags from the wrapping papers and sometimes the tags are damaged. These
matters easily lead some customers to shoplifting. The tags are recycled
if said tags are not sticked on but only put into the wrapping papers.
However, this way may adversely stimulate shoplifting. This method is
not recommended for the prevention of CD from being stolen.There occurred similar problems even in rental shops who stick the
shoplifting prevention tag directly on CD housing case or just insert
said tag into CD housing case. In particular, CD housing case is not
wrapped in rental shops, thus it is easy to take out the CD from the CD
housing case to shoplift. Some rental shops tried to wrap the CD housing
case with paper
