<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (12, 17, 40) and method for determining 
the position of a magnetic head (12) from a magnetic track 

(21) in a storage medium. The magnetic head (12) includes 
two magneto-resistive elements (14) electrically separated 

by an insulative layer (16); current leads (15) for biasing 
the MR elements (14) and rotating the magnetization of the 

MR elements (14) in opposite directions that are transverse 
from the respective axes of the elements (14); and 

circuitry (17, 40) to monitor the resistance changes of the 
respective MR elements (14) and producing respective first 

and second output signals and to manipulate the output 
signals to provide an indication of the cross-track 

position of the magnetic head (12) relative to the magnetic 

track (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to magnetic 
recording, and more particularly to apparatus and methods 
of obtaining the position of a magneto-resistive head 
relative to a magnetic track.
 
Due to the advancement and proliferation of technology, 
there is a constant need to store more information in a 
storage medium. A common form of the storage medium uses 
magnetic transitions on defined tracks of a surface of 
the medium. The transitions are written and read back by 
a magnetic head. In order to have more information on 
the tracks, there is a constant push to increase the 
track density by scaling down the width of the tracks. 
However, the higher the track density, the more difficult 
it is to accurately position the magnetic head over a 
track. During both the writing and reading process, the 
position of the head must be controlled to guarantee 
adequate signal quality for the required data integrity 
in a practical product environment. The position information in the form of magnetically 
encoded marks have been traditionally written on the 
medium to carefully control the position of the head with 
respect to the track. Signals from these marks are read 
by the head and manipulated to provide position 
measurements. These position measurements are then used 
by a position controller to more accurately position the 
head with respect to the track. Two methods are commonly used to encode the position 
information. They are the dedicated-servo method and the 
embedded-servo method. The dedicated-servo method is 
typically used for a disk drive with many surfaces to  
 
store information. One surface, known as the servo 
surface, is dedicated to position information only, while 
the remaining surfaces, known as the data surfaces, 
contain primarily user data. Each surface has a magnetic 
head to read and write data onto the surface, and all the 
heads are mechanically tied together. While one head, 
the servo head, follows the position data from the servo 
surface, the remaining heads, the data heads, are slaved 
to the servo head. As track densities continue to 
increase, a relative shift in position between either the 
servo head and the data heads, or the servo surface and 
the data surfaces may create unacceptable amount of 
position variations. These variations may be reduced by 
known alignment schemes. But even with such schemes, it 
is generally believed that the dedicated-servo method may 
not be extendable to storage media with high track 
densities. In the embedded-servo method
