<ABSTRACT>
An optical interference filter produced on a 
vitreous, light transmissive substrate, such as an 

electric lamp envelope, includes a plurality of 
alternating layers of tantala and silica in which 

each tantala layer includes titania in an amount of 
less than about 10 mole % whereby the microstructure 

of the tantala layers is controlled during subsequent 
crystallization and extrinsic stress in the 

tantala layers is reduced. Rather than or in addition 
to including titania in each tantala layer, the 

present invention additionally contemplates placing 
at least some of the tantala layers in contact with 

a titania layer (pre-layer and/or post-layer) whereby 
the microstructure of the tantala layers is controlled 

during subsequent crystallization and extrinsic 
stress in the tantala layers is reduced. 

The optical interference filters are produced by a 
process comprising depositing a plu
rality of alternating 
layers of tantala and silica on a vitreous, 

light transmissive substrate from respective precursors 
thereof by CVD, preferably LPCVD, to form a 

coated substrate. The filter may then be heated for 
a time and to a temperature effective to crystallize 

the tantala, preferably to a temperature ranging 
from about 550 to about 800°C and holding same within 

that temperature range for at least about one 
hour.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical interference 
filters which include alternating layers of 
tantala and silica and their use on lamps. Thin film optical coatings known as interference 
filters which comprise alternating layers 
of two or more materials of different indices of 
refraction are well known to those skilled in the  
 
art. Such optical coatings are used to selectively 
reflect or transmit light radiation from 
various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum 
and are used in the lamp industry to coat reflectors 
and lamp envelopes. Interference filters to be used for applications 
where the filters will be exposed to high 
temperatures in excess of about 500°C have been 
made of alternating layers of tantala (tantalum 
pentoxide, Ta2O5) and silica (SiO2), wherein the 
silica is the low refractive index material and 
the tantala is the high refractive index material. 
Such filters and lamps employing same are disclosed, 
for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,949,005; 4,689,519; 4,663,557; and 4,588,923. The problem of severe stress formation associated 
with the use of interference filters 
consisting of alternating layers of silica and 
tantala when employed at high temperatures was 
recognized in U.S. Patent No. 4,734,614. 
This patent teaches that tantala has 
limited physical and chemical stability, and 
crystallizes to a polycrystalline form after about 
30 minutes at 800°C which produces stress cracks 
visible as craquelé. This results in a filter 
that scatters both visible and infrared radiation, 
thereby rendering it unsuitable for its intended 
purpose. Responsive to the need for a process which 
would apply a relatively uniform coating to a 
complex shape and which would not result in a film 
containing such stresses that the film cracks and  
 
peels off the substrate, U.S. Patent No. 4,949,005 
to coinventor herein, T. Parham et al., provides an 
interference filter thin film optical coating consisting 
essentially of alternating layers of 
tantala and silica having relatively low light 
scattering which is suitable for use at high temperatures. 
The coatings are obtained by employing 
a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process and, 
preferably, a low pressure chemical vapor deposition 
(LPCVD) process to produce the coatings on a 
suitable substrate, such as quartz. After application 
of the alternating layers, the optical filter 
produced is annealed to avoid catastrophic extrinsic 
stress formation from volume changes due to 
crystallization of tantala at temperatures above 
abou
