<ABSTRACT>
In order to carry out refuelling of an aircraft, an installation is used associated with the telescopic gangway (10) serving to transfer passengers between the airport and the aircraft. The installation comprises a retractable extender mechanism (24) supported by the gangway (10) and a deformable nozzle (40) continuously linking a pressure coupling (22) of a fuel distribution network to a connector (28) carried by the extender mechanism (24). The installation is controlled by the energy available on the passageway (10) from a control desk (54). It can be totally or partially automated.

Telescopic loading bridge (10) for an aircraft (AN) having at least one 
port (O) for filling fuel, the loading bridge having an installation for 

refuelling the aircraft from a pressurized fuel distribution network, 
incorporating at least one pressure intake (22) located in the vicinity of 

an aircraft parking point, and the loading bridge being equipped with energy 
supply means (18) and characterized in that the refuelling installation 

comprises: 

at least one motorized, retractable, extension mechanism (24), mounted on 
the end of the telescopic loading bridge (10) and terminated by a coupling 

(28) which can be connected to the filling port (O), 
at least one deformable hose (24, 40) travelling along the loading bridge 
(10) and the extension mechanism (24) between the pressure intake and the 

coupling (28), 
means (42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52) for checking the fuel injected by the 
deformable hose (24, 40) and that said installation is controlled from the 

energy supply means (18) equipping the telescopic loading bridge (10). 
Loading bridge according to claim 1, characterized in that the extension 
mechanism (24) is remotely controlled from a control console (54) located 

in the loading bridge (10). 
Loading bridge according to claim 2, characterized by the refuelling 
installation having at least one video camera (56) placed at the end of the 

extension mechanism (24) and a video monitor located on the control console 
(54). 
Loading bridge according to claim 1, characterized in that the extension 
mechanism (24) is an entirely automatic, robotized mechanism. 
Loading bridge according to any one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized 
in that the end of the extension mechanism (24) is provided with proximity 

detectors. 
Loading bridge according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized  
 

in that the refuelling installation has an aircraft identification 
badge, on which are stored information relative to the aircraft, and a 

receiver placed on the loading bridge (10) and able to receive the informations 
stored on the badge. 
Loading bridge according to claims 4 and 6 combined, characterized in 
that the information stored on the badge includes the coordinates of the 

fuel filling port (O). 
Loading bridge according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that the control console (54) has means for the acquisition of counting 

data relative to the fuel supplied and means for transmitting, to a processing 
centre, counting data and information stored on the badge. 
Loading bridge according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the extension mechanism is a motorized, tubular arm (24) forming 

a deformable hose section. 
Loading bridge according to claim 9, characterized in that the motorized, 
tubular arm (24) has several segments articulated to one another and first 

motors able to control the relative pivoting between the segments. 
Loading bridge according to claim 10, characterized in that at least one 
of the segments is telescopic and has a second motor able to control an 

elongation of said segment. 
Loading bridge according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the hose has a section (40) associated with the loading bridge 

(10) and formed from articulated segments. 
Loading bridge according to any one of the claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that the hose has a section (40) associated with the loading bridge 

(10) and formed by a flexible hose.  
 
Loading bridge according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the checking means comprise fuel filtering means (46), supplied 

fuel quantity counting means (44) and means forming valves (42, 48, 50, 52).
