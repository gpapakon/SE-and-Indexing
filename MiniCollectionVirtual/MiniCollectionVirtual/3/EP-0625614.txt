<ABSTRACT>
A multi-purpose construction vehicle has a working arm (24) which is displaceably guided on a guide rail (25) in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle by means of a carrying slide (27). The guide rail (25) is arranged at the side of the driver's cab (6) and is integrated in the vehicle. The working arm (24) is mounted on the carrying slide (27) in such a way as to be pivotable by more than 240@ so that an implement (53) attached to its end can be swung in front of the driver's cab (6) and behind the driver's cab (6). The implement (53) is easily visible to the driver in all positions.
