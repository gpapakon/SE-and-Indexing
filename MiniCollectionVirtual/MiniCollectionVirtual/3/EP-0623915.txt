<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image decoding and recognition techniques, and in
particular to such techniques using stochastic finite state (Markov) source models.Automatic speech recognition systems based on hidden Markov models
(HMMs) and other stochastic grammar frameworks are known. Examples are
described in US-A-5,199,077 and reference [5] listed in the accompanying appendix.
HMMs have also been applied to document image recognition problems. The most
comprehensive of these attempts, called document image decoding (DID), is based
on an explicit communication theory view of document recognition (see EP-A-0,546,843, published by the EPO on 16.06.93,
and references [6,7,8,9,10] listed in the appendix). In the DID model, as
shown in Fig. 1 of EP-A-0,546,843, a stochastic message source selects a finite string
M from a set of candidate strings according to a prior probability distribution. The
imager converts the message into an ideal binary image Q. The channel maps the
ideal image into an observed image Z by introducing distortions due to printing and
scanning, such as skew, blur and additive noise. Finally, the decoder receives image Z
and produces an estimate M and of the original message according to a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) decision criterion.The structure of the message source and imager is captured formally by
modeling image generation using a Markov source, as depicted in Fig 1. Decoding
an image with respect to a Markov source involves finding the best (MAP) path
through a three dimensional (3D) decoding trellis indexed by the nodes of the model
and the coordinates of the image plane. A straightforward approach to MAP
decoding is to use a two-dimensional form of segmental Viterbi algorithm to
compute a set of recursively-defined likelihood functions at each point of the image
plane. The time complexity of Viterbi image decoding is O(∥β∥ × H × W), where ∥β∥ is
the number of branches in the source model and H and W are the image height and 
width, respectively, in pixels. Although the computation grows only linearly with
image size, in absolute terms it can be prohibitive. For example, a simple three state
model for a column of text in a single known font takes about 45 minutes to run on
an 8.5in × 11in image scanned at 300 dpi resolution. Thus, methods for decreasing
the required computation are essential if DID is to become a practical approach to
document image analysis.In the case of text column transcription, the complexity of image decoding
arises because, in effect, each row of the image

<CLAIMS>
A text-like image recognition method for analyzing a bitmap image into a
combination of symbol templates selected from a library of templates on the basis of

paths determined from traversing a decoding trellis using Markov source models and
Viterbi decoding, said Viterbi decoding comprising a 2-dimensional Viterbi

algorithm to compute a set of likelihood functions at each point of the image plane,
wherein each point of the image plane is represented in the decoding trellis by

nodes and transitions into each node and Viterbi decoding comprises computing the
likelihood of the most likely path into each node at each image plane point, the

method including the steps of:

(a) using as the Markov source model separable models,
(b) identifying those regions of the decoding trellis likely to contain the

best path, and
(c) performing full Viterbi decoding only in the regions determined in step
(b).
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which decoding is carried out by the ICP
algorithm as it is defined in Section 2 of the description.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein step (b) is carried out by upper
bounding the full decoding score using at least one heuristic function.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein a first heuristic function is used that is
based on weighted sums of the counts of black and white pixels in the rows of the

image. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein a second heuristic function is used
that is based on the full decoding scores of adjacent rows of the image.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the Markov source
model used in step(a) in claim 1 is subjected to a transforming process

in order to convert it into a separable form as far as possible, and
the result of the conversion is used.
An image recognition process based on an imaging model using finite state
networks and a given text-like input image to be decoded and an image network

having a set of nodes interconnected by directed transitions and with a start state
and final state and with each transition associated with attributes comprising a

character label, an image template and a transition probability, in which an output
image representing the decoded image is synthesized by traversing the branches of

the image network and at each node copying into the output the template attribute
associated with that specific branch into that node selected on the basis of a

maximum score computed by finding the most likely path through the decoding
trellis defined by the imaging model and the input image, the process including the

steps of:

(a) using as the imaging model for the networks a separable Markov
source,
(b) dividing the input image into rows,
(c) determining the image rows corresponding to the best path through
the separable Markov source, said determining step comprising:


(i) applying an ICP algorithm as it is defined in Section 2 of the description, using a weighted row projection
heuristic to produce a table of actual and heuristic scores, to those rows 

corresponding to the highest heuristic scores until the largest entry in the table
corresponds to an actual score.
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein step (c)(i) is carried out by using in
addition an adjacent row heuristic.
