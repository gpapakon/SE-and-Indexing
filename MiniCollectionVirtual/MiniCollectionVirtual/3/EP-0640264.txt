<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to radio
communication systems, and more specifically to two-way
radio communication systems comprising a method and
apparatus for performing hand-off and inbound calling from
a telephone system.Two-way radio communication systems that support hand-off
and inbound calling from a telephone system are well
known in the art. An example of such a system is a
cellular mobile telephone system - see also US-A-4 670 899. Other systems such as
those based on the Digital European Cordless
Telecommunications (DECT) standard have been proposed and
are under development by equipment vendors around the
world.Conventional systems that have a plurality of radio
coverage areas defined by a limited transmission distance
of one or more fixed communication units (FCUs) in each of
the areas require a centralized controller and switching
system in order to support hand-off and inbound calling.
The centralized controller and switching system maintain a
location registration database for each portable
communication unit (PCU) active in the system, and a call
registry for each call taking place in the system. The
location registration database is required for routing each
inbound call to a radio coverage area in which a called PCU
is located. The call registry is required for uniquely
associating each PCU with a telephone circuit destination
or path through the switch, so that after a hand-off the
PCU is connected to the same party as before the hand-off. A wireless communication system based on the DECT
standard is considered by those skilled in the art to be a
good choice for private business applications. This is
because the DECT standard provides a protocol that can
support hand-off, inbound calling, various data
transmission modes, and a high traffic density as required
for many private business applications. In large scale
private applications having many PCUs and many FCUs, a
central controller and switch for providing hand-off and
inbound calling is a reasonable solution, because the cost
of the controller and switch is a small fraction of the
cost of the whole system. However, in small scale private
applications having perhaps only two or three FCUs and a
handful of PCUs, the cost of a central controller and
switch can represent a large fraction of the total system
cost. Still, small systems with a plurality of radio
coverage areas nevertheless require hand-off capability as
a PCU moves from one radio coverage area to another, and
PCUs must be able to receive an incoming call
